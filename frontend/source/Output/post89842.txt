Intriguing connection issue on OS X <body> I've been recently having this issue with my internet connection on my MacBook Pro Early 2011 running OS X 10.8.3: from time to time the connection "freezes" for about 5 seconds and then comes back.   It happens strongemboth over Wi-Fi or over Ethernet cable/em/strong, and strongemit only happens to my machine when it's running OS X/em/strong (it won't happen when running Windows 7 on the same machine, or on any other machine/device). It makes Skype drop calls every 2 minutes or so, so it's very frustrating.  Pinging Google.com looks like this when running OS X em(there are hundreds of packets that return in less than 100ms (with a few in the 130 range), then a drop off for several seconds)/em:  precode64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=694 ttl=48 time=71.463 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=695 ttl=48 time=68.362 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=696 ttl=48 time=69.056 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=697 ttl=48 time=92.563 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=698 ttl=48 time=130.814 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=699 ttl=48 time=71.054 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=700 ttl=48 time=73.588 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=701 ttl=48 time=71.185 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=702 ttl=48 time=72.161 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=703 ttl=48 time=69.163 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=704 ttl=48 time=73.425 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=705 ttl=48 time=141.980 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=706 ttl=48 time=226.818 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=707 ttl=48 time=210.087 ms Request timeout for icmp_seq 708 Request timeout for icmp_seq 709 Request timeout for icmp_seq 710 Request timeout for icmp_seq 711 Request timeout for icmp_seq 712 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=713 ttl=48 time=73.582 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=714 ttl=48 time=70.994 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=715 ttl=48 time=72.502 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=716 ttl=48 time=70.467 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=717 ttl=48 time=68.470 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=718 ttl=48 time=70.767 ms 64 bytes from 173.194.34.196: icmp_seq=719 ttl=48 time=69.078 ms /code/pre  Note: my machine's Wi-Fi MAC is 68:a8:6d:29:cf:8a (static IP 192.168.1.250) and its Ethernet address is 3c:07:54:5a:e0:44 (static IP 192.168.1.251).

If you do (and you have the time before it starts working again), can you flush the arp table (codesudo arp -ad/code) and then see if your router's MAC address shows up in the ARP table again?   Also, try running a ping to your router's LAN IP address in one Terminal session, and maybe a ping to your router's WAN IP address in another while you're on Skype. See if all of them start timing out or just one of them. One more tool that I find useful is codemtr/code - you may need to get the source and compile it yourself or use fink / macports or other package manager. When you get it, just run it to a destination somewhere on the Internet and it will show you which hop stops responding.

As I mentioned in a comment, this looks very much like a QOS router kicking in due to your machine temporarily exceeding some bandwidth or packet rate cap.  What if you are doing different patterns, volumes and amounts of network traffic while on OS X as opposed to Windows and that's the real cause, not the hardware drivers or the software?  I would expect running OS X is correlated with your observations, but what if it's not the cause of the temporary network pauses.  Have you tried researching what if any QOS filters and routing changes are implemented by your network provider? Have you considered tunneling all traffic to another computer (ssh or VPN) so that you can rule out trivial filters. em(If the provider is doing deep packet inspection, or destination and true rate limiting - you may not be able to escape these short timeouts.)/em  I hope there's an answer you can find by looking at the details of the network (and we'll all learn something from exploring those options) - but be sure you also consider that your measurement tools and added traffic to ping / poke at things could be affecting the traffic counts and making it more likely Skype will drop for you. The routers I set up are programmed to drop ICMP traffic before all other traffic since when capacity gets tight - I'd rather the ping fail and other packets get through. Your ISP and network provider might have set things up similarly.  <answer90955> In addition to all the stuff here, you might want to make sure Auto Proxy Discovery is not on (as well as Automatic Proxy Configuration). That tends to cause more problems than not and it's often not needed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZpnA.jpg" alt="System Preferences"  <answer91069> With all the great diagnostic information in this question you have narrowed down the possibilities greatly.    To begin with, your pings to 192.168.1.1 greatly isolate the problem to either your router, computer, or LAN.  This is not a problem with DNS or your ISP.  I'm most disturbed by the results of your ping tests to 192.168.1.1.   Did you do something weird in setting them up?  For example, you have successful pings with ICMP sequence numbers of 24267, 24268, and 24269, then 3 timeouts, then success again with ICMP 24273.  So the numbers of the successes seem right. However, the numbers of the timeouts are completely different.  I'd expect to see request timeouts from ICMP 24270, 24271, and 24272 but instead the timeouts report ICMP 89806, 89807, and 89808.  I've never seen that before and so to me it suggests you have a broken network stack on that computer.  Perhaps one too many extensions.  Any chance you have Netgear Genie installed?  Or maybe VPN software?    In any case, I'd say it's time to start disabling "enhancements" to see if you can find a culprit installed on the computer.   h2Edit/h2  OK, mystery solved.  The ICMP sequence number is a 16 bit field.  Treated as an unsigned integer, that means it has a maximum value of 65,535 and then wraps around to zero.  So if the local ping program is maintaining a 32 bit integer counter (which it probably would by default), it could report a 32 bit integer number for missing packets.  However, when reading replies, the reply will necessarily only have the last 16 bits of the counter.  So the reply to sequence number 89805 will be 89505 &amp; 0xFFFF which is 24269.  <answer91375> This smells like another device on your network is trying to use the same IP as you, or some trouble with DHCP.  Could you see if you can still reproduce it after assigning yourself a static IP?  Goto Network Preferences, choose your Ethernet interface, advanced, TCP/IP  Change the "Configure IPv4" dropdown to "Manually"  IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.150 (something unique, not what DHCP had assigned you before) Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Router: 192.168.1.1  Save  Then try to reproduce the issue again.  When doing this test, make sure your Wi-Fi is off so only your Ethernet is in use.  This will help narrow it down.  hr  If you're still having the issue, you should download Wireshark (http://www.wireshark.org/) start a capture, reproduce the issue, save the dump and let us take a look.  Also, what Router/AP are you using?  <answer91545> Two things to check that correlate to this being caused by increase LAN traffic due to new roommates.  ol liAre there QoS (Quality of Service) settings on the router, and if so, how are they set?  Skype traffic would be prioritized and if the WAN is getting saturated the router might respond by temporarily shutting of lower priority connections./li liIs the router CPU simply getting overloaded?  When I upgraded from 1 Gbs DSL to 5 Gbs cable service I found that my router simply could not keep up with the increased traffic and had to buy a new one. Investigate the performance of your router and see if this could be a problem.  Most routers have detailed performance reviews available on the internet; check and see how your router is rated compared to your internet service capacity. /li /ol  <answer104689> Hey guys I was having the same exact problem, but I just unplugged the headphones I was using and I have been talking with my friend for the first 10 minutes now and it still hasn't dropped, when before it dropped at 20 seconds.   My headphones cord was ripped so it may have been causing the problem, but I don't know much anything about the ip address and ping stuff, and this just seemed to help me out. If you try and it does not work do not blame me, because it fixed my problem.  <answer106865> Look similar to this?  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5483424?tstart=0  I just posted this for Mavericks.  Thoughts?  <answer119826> I know this is an old topic.  But thanks everyone for this troubleshooting. All the steps helped me troubleshoot an issue where I was able to ping hosts but not connect to them via telnet.  The solution was rather simple (afterwards) removed all the unnecessary stuff from here (as zac mentioned)  Login:  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/ System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Items  Startup:  /Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/StartupItems/ /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist (rarely exists)  Again, thanks all  <answer120606>    The solution was rather simple (afterwards) removed all the unnecessary stuff from here (as zac mentioned)      Login:      ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/ System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Items      Startup:      /Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/StartupItems/ /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist (rarely exists)   i know this is an old thread, but doing this fixed the problem i had. My internet would at times disconnect and ping's would drop all the time. What would fix my problem is turning off wi-fi or ethernet (which ever i was using), then re-enable it. Of course this would only temporarily fix the problem.  It was weird because whenever my mac pro 4,1 would have this issue, my mac laptop would being losing pings as well. It was almost like my Mac Pro would bring down my network.  I tried so many things! replacing the modem, router, called isp, bought usb to ethernet. none of those things worked, until i tried this!  I did whats mentioned above and it finally fixed the problem !!  <answer160020> I've had this problem for a long time now (beginning after an upgrade to Mavericks) and, after months of research, I think I finally found a fix.  First of all, there are quite a number of people with the very same problem in the Apple forums:  ul liWhy in OS X Mavericks internet is so slow?/li liMavericks network issue/li /ul  So this is a known issue and I really don't know why Apple has not yet provided a fix for this. In the threads listed above, there are many suggestions to fix this, but most of those did not work. Some fix the problem temporarily:  ul liDisconnect and reconnect the network/li liThe old friend: reboot/li liRemove the folder containing the network config: codesudo rm -rf /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code/li /ul  After these measures, the network connection feels much better and I do not experience drops for several hours or sometimes even days. But the problems always come back.  This question and the hints that the problem might be related to ARP brought me to start further research and I found this page, which describes the bug in detail and also contains a patch, which I cite here:  precodesudo su touch /etc/sysctl.conf echo net.link.ether.inet.arp_unicast_lim=0 &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf chown root:wheel /etc/sysctl.conf chmod 0644 /etc/sysctl.conf /code/pre  Please refer to the provided link for an in-depth explanation of the fix, which is supposed to be included in a future OS update for Yosemite by Apple. It disables unicast ARP requests, which cause confusion with some network equipment like your home router.  After applying the fix and rebooting, it should be checked if  precodesudo sysctl -a | grep net.link.ether.inet.arp_unicast_lim /code/pre  returns codenet.link.ether.inet.arp_unicast_lim: 0/code. If the number is not equal to zero, the fix was not applied correctly.  Afterwards, I found another thread at the apple communities that contains the same solution: Mavericks and Failed ARP causing network drops! Well, after you know what the problem is, finding the correct solution is a lot easier.  <answer185969> I had a similar problem and in my case it seems to be caused by Tunnelblick, even when VPN was not connected. I uninstalled it (with the uninstaller, not just drag to Trash) and problem went away.  <comment105552> I experience this, too! It is soooo annoying. Not sure if this stared with 10.8.3. My Mac is a MBA Mid 2012. The network freezes can last up 15 seconds, though. <comment105562> That wouldn't cause this problem. ping does a DNS lookup once (google.com - 173.194.34.196 in this case), then use the IP address from then on. <comment105948> Please check if your Skype is set to: Incoming Connection Port: 12794 <comment106033> Did this, will shortly edit the question with the results. <comment106037> My skype is set to port 15973 <comment106057> When I do 'arp -an' after deleting the table it doesn't list the router until the connection is back on. <comment106060> I added installation instruction for MTR on mike's answer <comment106061> I realized that, at least once, the router's WAN IP changed after a massive loss of connection. What is surprising is that other devices have absolutely no problem! <comment106224> OK then - a few more questions. Do you have a separate router and an access point, or are they all integrated? If they are separate - do you have a switch between the Router and the Access Point? Also - if you're connected with Ethernet - do you connect to the same switch (please note - I still mean a separate device) <comment106255> Hi Miguel, adding more voodoo after seeing your screen shots. could you try these three things: 1: disable bluetooth, 2: test network interfaces 1 by 1? 3: just to confirm, you are using stock network drivers, right? <comment106280> My setup is pretty simple: just one router (a livebox 2). I tried different Wi-Fi configurations and all of the Ethernet ports with no luck. This started happening about 2 weeks ago and I have absolutely no idea what could have triggered it. Some days are worse than others, it happens at different hours... I can't seem to find a pattern. <comment106281> I haven't tried to disable Dropbox, would that be helpful? And also, could you explain the reason for removing those items? Thanks! <comment106284> You want to isolate if the issue is with OS X or a piece of software that was added after the initial install. Things like dropbox that make network connections as soon as the user account loads, or anti-virus software that typically runs in all user accounts may be reserving a port or otherwise contributing to the issue. <comment106296> What is your DHCP configuration like?  Is it possible you have a statically assigned IP address conflicting with either another static address or one handed out by DHCP? <comment106304> The DHCP server is enabled but, in an effort to try to solve the problem, I set static IP's for me and the other computers in the network. <comment106305> Ok, I'll do this and will post here the results tomorrow. <comment106393> The system.log is huge... I searched specific words but couldn't find anything relevant :( <comment106394> I will edit the question adding the data that netstat -s gave me. <comment106395> I already deleted all the network config. and added back everything manually but with no luck. Bluetooth has always been off. I am using stock network drivers. All network interfaces give exactly the same results: a momentary loss of connection every now and then :( <comment106431> Will do this and report back. <comment106439> When this is happening, can you still ping any of the other devices in the same LAN? I don't think the problem is with DHCP or anything at layer 3. I think the problem is at layer 2 - for some reason your router/access-point stop responding to Layer 2 traffic from your Mac. While I do understand that you don't have the same issues with other devices, to me it points at the problem with your livebox 2. Do you have similar issues when your Mac is connected to another Wifi or another Ethernet connection? (e.g. in work, at your friend's place, etc)? <comment106448> icmp and ip packet error concern me.    separately, install a fresh copy of OSX and boot from it via USB. This will  isolate  your install of OSX.   if a fresh copy remains buggy, well then we have a hardware error - who knows, may be only OSX drivers will trigger it. Show that problem appears in fresh install, and apple should fix it for you <comment106569> Are you using the same IP address for Windows 7? If not, try it.  Your netstat shows a very high number of bad connection attempts.  Any idea why? At this point I think you need to set up packet capture to see what's happening on the wire when the timeouts happen.  See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3994 for instructions or consider using http://www.tastycocoabytes.com/cpa/ . In particular, I want to see if, during the outage, the computer is still sending pings to the router and if there are ping responses on the wire that are being sent to a different Ethernet MAC address. <comment106630> → Miguel: excellent network problem trouble shooting ☺ ! Clearly the internal ping toward your router (192.168.1.1) is sufficient to exhibit that the problem is located between MacOS X and your router. Are you using the `Automatic` Location? <comment106632> → Blip: this isn't a DNS related problem. The ping toward the router with an IP address doesn't make any udp paquet, just silly icmp echo. <comment106635> → mike: `mtr` is an excellent tool. Unfortunatelly here the problem is much less far. The problem seems to stand between MacOS X and the 192.168.1.1. No need to hunt toward the horizon of the Internet ☺. <comment106636> → gentmatt & Miguel: could you try to downgrade to MacOS X 10.8.2 and check with a local ping if you experience the same 6 s (or more) hole? <comment106658> → Miguel: Dropbox couldn't be your problem. Dropbox is simply doing 443/tcp like any other web browsing. But in case you wanted to do a network sniffing (Wireshark or tcpdump) stopping Dropbox will remove you a bunch of tcp traffic. Hence this will help you "see" any misbehaviour. <comment106660> Before changing network channel because you think that you have an interference problem, just diagnoze it cleraly. This is pretty easy: use http://www.istumbler.net/. You will look at the truth straight in the eyes ☺. <comment106751> daniel Azuelos: I deleted all my locations and configured a new location that I called "HOME" with only Ethernet and Airport. I set up an static IP on my router for Ethernet and another one for Airport and I entered everything manually on the network configuration. <comment106752> Old Pro: I will try what you suggest and post the results as soon as possible. Thanks! <comment106753> @mike: this issue happens only on this network... I went out yesterday and checked out public networks to find that I didn't have this problem. It points to some kind of bad communication between OS X and my router. <comment106762> When 192.168.1.1 chokes 'netstat -m' doesn't show anything out of the ordinary. By the way, grep can't seem to find '/var/log/kernel.log'. I'm editing the question with the results of 'netstat -I en1' (I'm using en1 right now, which is my Airport, en0 is inactive). What might be the reason for the DOS attack? <comment106763> → Miguel: to simplify your analysis of your problem, make a new network conf. with just the Ethernet interface on. Then keep within a window a `ping 192.168.1.1` (which won't do any DNS request). <comment106766> → Miguel: don't use 2 different interfaces on MacOS X to analyse a network problem: just investigate one at a time. Start with the Ethernet one. Your problem look typical of the cursed `Automatic` network configuration. <comment106771> Everyone: Thank you so much for your responses, specially to MIKE, OLD PRO and DANIEL AZUELOS. Since the bounty time is over and the issue still persists, I rolled the dice between you three and DANIEL AZUELOS will get the +50... BUT I will open another bounty right away so please, bear with me. <comment106787> This is the signature of a downstream routing failure. Specifically, my guess is either a routing table changes or a QOS filter decides to queue your packets and deliver other higher priority packets preferentially for a time period. You've got some great help here, but I'd spend a short amount of time with your network provider to understand when and how they will throttle your connection. You may be able to test this indirectly by severely curtailing other traffic or routing this traffic through a VPN to a data center elsewhere to avoid elementary QOS triggers. <comment106788> These are some nice troubleshooting guesses, but if you were to explain how and why you felt these items would impact network continuity, the answer would both be of more use to the OP, but also teach people in similar situations the _why_ you suggested this as opposed to something to rule out. <comment106792> → Miguel: you might have been unwillingly the author of your DOS attack ☹, but this is still to be confirmed. I suspect a network loop caused by an `Automatic` configuration. <comment106833> @Miguel, some more guesses. 1. have you contacted your ISP to see whether they can check line quality? 2. how about setting up a test user account to see if the issue moves. A third suggestion is to check your system - things like permissions check - machine diagnostics. 4. can you possibly swap out components - run your computer at a friend's location - borrow your friends router - oh, and remove all other network gear from your system. <comment106859> Miguel: the fact you don't seem to be affected by this on any other network to me seems to indicate the issue is really between your router and the Mac. I disagree with the others that the problem is with your ISP. When your issue occurs, you don't see a MAC address of your router in your ARP table. This is a lower layer than DHCP, routing, etc as these all require Layer 2 connectivity to work. You don't have Layer 2 connectivity working when the issue manifests itself. (TBC) <comment106862> (Part 2): The only other thing I would check (if your router allows) is to log in to the router from another device and see if you can clear and then see the MAC address of your Mac on the router while the issue occurs (so similar to what you've done on your MBP). This will show if there is one way connectivity or no connectivity. I've had similar issues with a Linksys Access Point - it would stop forwarding Ethernet frames (so affect Layer 2) and as the result of that EVERYTHING would stop working. I was able to work around the problem by switching the AP to 5GHz band. <comment106985> → Miguel: could you provide us an `ifconfig -a` ? <comment107004> Hi. I didn't do anything weird... it's just a 'sudo ping 192.168.1.1'... I see what you are saying about the ICMP sequence numbers... I have no idea why that might be... maybe the ping was running for too long? (it's been running for days)... No idea. Also, my network configuration is preeeetty simple and I've been using the same configuration for years with no problem. <comment107005> Software that is always running in the background and that might have something to do with this: Little Snitch, Dropbox, Skype, and all OS X stuff... but nothing new, and the problem started about a month ago. One thing that I do suspect is that it was about a month ago when 2 new roommates moved in. I ran ping tests in their computers and they are not having this problem though. <comment107006> Thanks for the advice, they were already off though :( <comment107008> @Miguel, definitely remove Little Snitch as that is exactly the kind of software that could be creating this problem.  If you haven't got a complicated configuration I'd say completely uninstall it and even empty the trash to make sure it's gone and reboot and see if that fixes the problem. <comment107009> I see... but nothing changed in my networking activity in the past 5 years. This problem started about a month ago and I can't find any correlations except that it was about a month ago when 2 colleagues moved in. But I ran ping tests on their machines and they don't experience this issue. I'm not aware of any QOS filters but I will try to find out. <comment107010> Skype is hosting a call almost 24/7 on my machine... I'll turn off all pings, etc today to see if something changes the next time the connection drops (because I can still tell if it drops by listening to the audio I get from the Skype call) <comment107011> I'll do this if I can get some spare time, I have a lot of work to get done :\ <comment107012> @DavidDelMonte the computer does fine at other locations. I'll try setting up a new user account. My ISP tells me everything is perfect, and other machines in my network have no problem. I repaired permissions and everything is perfect, but I can't swap components. <comment107013> I'll edit the question now with the results. <comment107014> I made a new network configuration with just ethernet and will ping '192.168.1.1' for the next 24 hours to see what happens. <comment107016> @mike Got it... it definitely is a problem between Mac and router. I can try to check for my Mac's MAC from another device at a time of connection drop... but is there any other way? I have to ask my roommates to cooperate for this and none of us have much time off work. <comment107017> Ok, I will completely uninstall it and see what happens (but I've been using it for years with no problem). <comment107018> @mike do you think Little Snitch might be a possible cause? I've been using it for years and never had this happen until now though... but maybe my LAN is more busy now that 2 more people moved in... What do you think? <comment107028> → Miguel: could you provide us an `ifconfig -a` on your Ethernet only configuration? If you have the luck to be able to produce your problem on Ethernet, then it's much easier to focuse on this simpler form of the problem (Ethernet is 1 dimension where Wireless is 3 ☺). <comment107107> Miguel - not sure about Little Snitch - never used it. I don't think so though, as it seems the issue is on the Layer 2. Usually when Applications do something over the network they use the system provided TCP/IP stack (either by using system calls or one of many Frameworks). There are exceptions, firewalls and sniffers are good examples. I would still think that if Little Snitch bypasses the system's TCP/IP stack, it does that at Layer 3. Checking if your MBP's Mac address is visible on a different device (another PC or a MAC) is a good idea (TBC) <comment107108> (Part 2)... just make sure you try to run ping both to the router and that other box at the same time. The fact you don't seem to experience the same issue on another network confirms the issue is local to your setup. You mentioned your LAN is more busy after the other two people moved in. Does it mean there was no issues like this before, or did you not experience them as often but they were still there? This could mean an interface on your router is somewhat overloaded.. what brand and model of a router is it? <comment107111> The one more thing I would add here is to try to run [wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org) - it's a very good (probably the best?) and free packet analyser. You can run it on your machine and see if it's sending any frames and packets out its network interface while the issue occurs (e.g. what you're looking for is ARP requests after you've flushed the arp cache), and if you're receiving any responses. If your problem is caused say by corrupted frames, you'll see that. You'll also need to get XQuartz if you want GUI (which is well worth it). <comment107119> @mike, what do you make of the fact that ping timeouts report ICMP sequence numbers from a different sequence than ping successes?  http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/91069/21703 <comment107162> → mike: `Wireshark` is a great tool but reserved to gurus which are fluent in `arp`, `ifconfig`, `netstat` & `ping` options ☺. <comment107275> Does this occur when you are on another network entirely, such as at school or work? If you boot your MacBook Pro into Recovery Mode (boot pressing cmd+R) does it occur there through Safari and/or Terminal? If the answer to either of these is no I would do a system backup and reinstall the OS. <comment107447> Funny... 24269 in binary is 0000 0101 1110 1100 1101. 89806 in binary form is 0001 0101 1110 1100 1110. However, if we take 24269 and just swap bit 16, we get 0001 0101 1110 1100 1101 = 89805. To me it looks like signed vs. unsigned integer, so its purely number presentation. It might be that the device Miguel is pinging uses unsigned integer instead of signed (or the other way around)... <comment120934> → Miguel: is your problem analysed, fixed? Do you still need some help? What's the best answer? <comment125422> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment126037> @danielAzuelos The problem has not been solved. I gave up on making skype calls at certain hours. <comment126039> @danielAzuelos There is no best answer but the answers that received the bounties are the ones I feel were closest to the solution. <comment126080> → Miguel: reading once more your original problem description I'm convinced this is typical of the `Automatic` location configuration of MacOS X. This is a key difference with Windows. <comment126832> I will try to take a look at the solution in the link to see if it helps me as well. Will post back. <comment198476> This solved my issue, I moved off the `Automatic` Location in Network Preferences, created a new location for Home and Work and that appears to have stopped the block timeouts. <comment233216> Odd thing for me is I get this same problem but I am running Microsoft OS exclusive on my 2008 MacBook Pro 15" I get this traffic slowdown in both wifi and ethernet. Is there a solution? Is this hardware related? Thanks
