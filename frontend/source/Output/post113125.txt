Rip audio file from video file in OSX <body> I've got an mp4 video file. I'd like to take the audio from that video, and create an audio file. The output encoding could be AAC or MP3, it wouldn't make any difference.  Which applications would be easiest to do this, and what steps should I take?  <answer113127> I use Evom from The Little App Factory to achieve this. It works very well and it's free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZFBN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Once you download it, you will see this window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iwgwt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Drag and drop the video(s) onto the window and another window will pop up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rypuS.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DRfYc.png" alt="enter image description here"  For the most amount of control, I recommend the "Folder" tab. Here, you can create a new name for the file, select where you would like it to go, a range of formats, and even the quality. After that, select "Convert".  In my case, I selected it to be converted to an MP3 file and move it to the desktop. Here's the result.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ph35c.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This process is very easy and you can even convert more than one video at a time.  <answer113129> You can use code-c copy/code with ffmpeg to extract audio without re-encoding:  precodeffmpeg -i input_file -c copy audio.m4a /code/pre  Run codeffmpeg -i input_file/code to see what format the audio stream is. If it is MP3 instead of AAC, change the extension of the output file to mp3.  This would re-encode the audio as 256 kb/s AAC:  precodeffmpeg -i input_file -ab 256k audio.m4a /code/pre  It is likely that codeffmpeg/code is not on your system. You can install codebrew/code (brew.sh) and then do a codebrew install ffmpeg/code to install ffmpeg.  <answer113161> To rip audio from a video file, you can use iTunes. It'll create an AAC file.  ol liDrag the video into iTunes  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Cd5u.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect the file in Movies, and hit the menu commands strongFile - Create New Version/strong. Hit the kbdOption/kbd key, and the command strongConvert To AAC/strong will be enabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m10Y9.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liThe AAC file will be created in the same directory that the mp4 video is located.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JWYQ6.png" alt="enter image description here" /li /ol  <answer113423> this works best for me:  ol liCreate a folder, for instance called "video stripper"./li liIn Automator, create a Folder Action./li liAssociate the Folder Action with the folder "video stripper"./li liDrag the action "Import audio files [into iTunes]" to the Folder Action. 4b. (Optional) add the action "Import files into iTunes" if you want to have the imported audio files added to a dedicated play list./li liSave the Folder Action under an arbitrary name./li /ol  Henceforth all audio from video files dropped into the folder will appear automatically in your iTunes library. If you never need those video files again, select "Delete source files after encoding" in the action "Import audio files".  <answer113433> Using strongQuickTime Player/strong:  File /    Export /      Audio Only  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0iDu0.jpg" alt="QuickTime Player / File / Export / Audio Only..."  <answer113483> I have used the Mac app, Music Converter, a number of times without any problems. It is free from Shedworxs and saves me from having to open iTunes.   http://www.shedworx.com/musicconverter  Note: I'm not in any way affiliated with the authors of the app or the company.  <answer141047> It seems there are many options. If you are going to edit the audio in Logic Pro you can extract the audio when importing the file there as well.  <comment132816> @Lauri, this answer was not a community wiki. It is not acceptable to change that much of my answer in a revision. Thank you for not touching it again. <comment132817> I actually preferred this answer with Lauri's edit; it gave a lot more information. It's also in the spirit of StackExchange: edit questions and answers to make them better. As Joel & Jeff say: if you're not comfortable with having your answer edited, SE may not be the place for you. Answers are valuable in the long-tail value that they add to the internet, not so much for the asker and answerer. <comment132825> Editing answers to improve them or add additional information is part of the philosophy of this site, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editing for details. <comment166183> You can change which audio encoder to use (Apple Lossless, MP3, AIFF) in the preferences. <comment166197> Clean and easy way for a base OS X to do this. <comment166200> +1 "I want a Hippocampus for Christmas" <comment274398> Note: this creates a `.m4a` (AAC) file. This 100% answers the original question, but if you need MP3 this answer will not do it. <comment274399> â€¦however, you can use iTunes to convert your m4a to mp3 afterwards, as described in http://osxdaily.com/2009/12/03/convert-m4a-to-mp3/ <comment350055> You also need to add the `-vn` argument so that ffmpeg doesn't mux video into the m4a file.
