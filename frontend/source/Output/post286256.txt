Maximize applications by default when opening (auto hide dock enabled) <body> I have noticed that when the dock menu auto-hide feature is enabled, applications (here Chrome) do not automatically open maximized - instead they open at their maximum size as if the dock were still present leaving a rather annoying gap which must be resolved by manually maximizing the window every single time an application is opened.  How can I get applications to open maximized by default?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Neuca.png" alt="screenshot"  <comment361128> Chrome is well-known for totally ignoring the Apple guidelines in many aspects. Do you see the same behaviour in Apple apps &/or does manually dragging to the required size work for subsequent launches? <comment361143> Manual dragging does not help. Will check other apps soon. Thanks! <comment361145> It is just chrome as far as I can tell!!
