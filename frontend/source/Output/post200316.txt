How can I disable and/or uninstall "Messages" from OS X Yosemite? <body> This "Messages" application on my Macbook Pro, OS X Yosemite 10.10.4  I would like to uninstall the "Messages" application entirely. How can I do this?  <answer222719> While Apple stock OS X apps cannot be deleted, you can remove the your Apple ID's association with the Messages app by opening Messages and clicking Messages  Preferences  Accounts.  From there you can remove your Apple ID (and therefore the phone numbers associated with it) and your problem should stop.  <comment241374> Similar situation covered by [this answer.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/25499/120171) <comment355172> I already removed my Apple ID (well it's still there but greyed out saying "inactive". But the app still opens when I receive a message on my phone.
