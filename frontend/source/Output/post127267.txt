Where are iOS7 system wallpapers? <body> Where are iOS7 system wallpapers in the file system?  P.S. accessible with iFile or ssh (jailbroken).  e.g. /var/mobile/...  <answer127269> strong/Library/Wallpaper/strong is a symlink to the relevant location on the device.  The actual location is code/var/stash/Wallpaper.xxxxxx/&lt;iOSdevice&gt;/code with xxxxxx being a generated string and &lt;iOSdevice being the type of iOS device (e.g. iPhone). The wallpapers are contained within this folder along with the thumbnails.
