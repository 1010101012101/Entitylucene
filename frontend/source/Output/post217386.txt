How to rename an external hard drive in Mac OS X? <body> I have 2 external hard drives supplied by the same vendor.br They both have the same name.br Using them with the mac is problematic when they have the same name.br Time Machine, for example, tries to back up to the external drive with this name.br I would like to simply change the name of one of these external hard drives.    Multiple forums have suggested 2 solutions:br 1: In Finder, just change the name of the drive like you would any folderbr 2: Use Disk Utility    Neither of these solutions work for me.br The name of the external drive is read only in both applications.  <answer217425> If the file format of the external hard drive is NTFS, then El Capitan will allow you to only read the contents of the drive. To rename the drive, or to modify any contents of the drive, you will have to format the drive with OS X File system.  <answer234079> Go to the information tab for the drive i.e., highlight the drive in the Finder, click kbdCommand/kbd + kbdI/kbd. Under codeName &amp; Extension/code, highlight the name in that field and change it to whatever you want. Took me a while to figure it out, too.  <answer237579> You are all talking about empartitions/em, not emphysical disks/em. I recently cloned my internal drive (both physical and partition name strongOSX8/strong) and did a fresh install of 10.11, naming the partition strongOSX11/strong. Now I have a partition called strongOSX11/strong on a physical disk called strongOSX8/strong.  For me, I think the only difference is the confusion of it being displayed that way in Disk Utility, but I can see how it could be a significant problem with two external disks named the same by the vendor, e.g. strong2 TB Newer Technology/strong.  10.11 complicates this by the switch to "Core Store". Apparently you can perform some manipulations with "diskutil cs â€¦", but that is dangerous.  <comment262778> What filesystem format is the drive using? NTFS? <comment262780> NTFS. One is formatted with the mac file system but it's damaged and can only be used in read-only mode. I need to reformat it. <comment262781> What version of OS X?  10.11? <comment262782> 10.11.1: El Capitan <comment262790> When you open Finder and get information - what specifically happens when you click on the volume name? Specifically, look at the Sharing & Permissions and Name & Extension sections of that window. I wound't use Disk Utility since it can be far more destructive than Finder in terms of renames. <comment262805> Highlight the drive on your desktop, hit the return key, type your new name :) <comment262806> It's read only there too. <comment262807> @bmike: it says "You can only read" <comment262810> Have you formatted these disks? El Capitan only supports NTFS as read-only. In order to rename the disks you need to format with the OS X Extended file system. <comment338934> Or use something like Fuse for MacOS, which will allow you to use the drive normally (though renaming may not be supported -- which is the reason I arrived here in the first place).
