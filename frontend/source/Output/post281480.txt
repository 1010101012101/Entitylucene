How do I turn off auto-linking in Messages, on MacOS? <body> When I send a message in Messages on my Mac, the text is sometimes auto-linked if it matches some product.  For instance, I used the phrase "dark places", and the Messages app linked it to a film of the same name in the iTunes Store.  I cannot locate a setting in Messages to turn this off.  Anyone know how?  I don't need my own words commercialized for me.  :)  <comment354224> Try putting the phrase in quotes.
