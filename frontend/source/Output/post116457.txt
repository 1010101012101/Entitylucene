Remote control of MBP from Windows with Multi-Monitor <body> I recently purchased a MBP as a replacement for my aging Dell laptop and am trying to duplicate my work environment with the MBP. Let me explain.  I have a Win7 desktop machine with two monitors. I used to remotely connect to my Dell laptop using RDP. RDP had an option that let me use both the monitors of my Win7 desktop while connected to the Dell laptop as if the Dell had two monitors as well.  With my MBP I've attempted to use a number of VNC viewers to connect from my Win7 desktop to the MBP and still take advantage of both Win7 monitors. In essence I want both Win7 monitors to act as if they were both MBP monitors just as the Dell would using RDP.  Is this possible?
