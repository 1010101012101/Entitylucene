Change ISO volume label on OS X? <body> I have some ISO files here with weird volume labels. I want to rename them to something I can easily remember.  I know in Windows using either winiso or poweriso (both are non-free?) it can be done but I'm not so sure in OS X. I did search the net but nothing useful came up.  Thanks!  edit: I believe it's best explained with an example:  I have an ISO file called "myiso.iso". When I double-click on the ISO file to mount it, it appears as "myweirdname" in Finder."myweirdname" is the ISO Volume name.  <answer235285> There is no direct way, that I know of, natively in OS X to edit the emvolume label/name/em of an ISO Image as can be done by using, e.g., UltraISO in Windows.  In other words, with the proper preferences set for UltraISO the emvolume label/name/em can be changed and saved to the ISO Image without recompiling it. I actually use UltraISO under OS X via Wine for this very reason.  Although this cannot be done natively directly under OS X, nonetheless it can be done using codehdiutil/code by creating a new ISO Image from the mounted ISO Image having the emvolume label/name/em wanting to be changed.  You'll need to use the codehdiutil imageinfo/code command, e.g. codehdiutil imageinfo $NAME.ISO/code, to get the necessary information to configure the codehdiutil makehybrid/code command to make the new ISO Image having the emvolume label/name/em that your want, instead of what it currently is. Have a look at the man page for codehdiutil/code or just type codehdiutil makehybrid -help/code in Terminal.  As an example, I'm going to use an ISO Image, of a DVD, that does not contain any DRM, as the source has to be DRM free.  The key info I'm looking at is, codepartition-scheme:/code, codepartition-name:/code and codepartition-filesystems:/code showing respectively, codeISO9660/code, code$NAME/code, and both codeISO9660: $NAME/code and codeUDF: $NAME/code where code$NAME/code is shown as, e.g., codeFOO_BAR_WEIRD/code in all three places.  I just want it to say codeFOO_BAR/code, getting rid of the codeWEIRD/code part, so my command line will be as follows, after first mounting the codeFOO_BAR_WEIRD.ISO/code image by double-clicking it in Finder, in Terminal I used the following command:  precodehdiutil makehybrid -iso -udf -iso-volume-name FOO_BAR -udf-volume-name FOO_BAR -o FOO_BAR.ISO /Volumes/FOO_BAR_WEIRD /code/pre  I then used codehdiutil imageinfo FOO_BAR.ISO/code and compared it to the output of codehdiutil imageinfo FOO_BAR_WEIRD.ISO/code and it showed it has the same codepartition-scheme:/code and codepartition-filesystems:/code but different code$NAME/code, as it should. The file size was ~.5MB larger however the newly created ISO Image had the name I wanted and played just fine as the original did.  So, it's doable but it takes a little time, work and extra disk space, which is why I run UltraISO via Wine under OS X. :)  Note: I tested this using a DRM free ISO Image of a Movie DVD and may require additional command line options and or additional steps depending on the type and contents of the ISO image.  <answer276831> I ran into this issue myself.  Even though you change the name of the ISO, when mounted it gives these arbitrary names as the mount point.  After much trial &amp; error, reading upon reading, and learning more about CD/DVD directory allocation than I ever wanted to know, I have stumbled upon a process that is quite simple and achieves the desired results.   Note: I assume you already have created an ISO image via whatever software application you use.  I am working in the downloads folder of my Mac...  1) Create a new folder with the desired mount point name, will be used later as the new mount name.  It is character limited (I believe less that 16 characters) and does not like spaces.  If you need to separate words use the emunderscore/em.  2) mount the offending iso.  3) select the iso in finder ctrl+a to select all items in the image.  4) ctrl+v to paste contents into the newly created folder.  5) Once the content has completed the copy, open the diskutility gui.  6) Select File  New Image  Image from Folder.  7) Select the New folder you created with the desired mount name.  8) Direct the new image to be created in your documents directory (I have found fewer errors in the process when sending it to a directory other that the active one containing the image files), select unencrypted option, select DVD/Master as format.  9) this will create a new image in the documents folder as a .cdr with the name of whatever you elected in the previous screen.  rename the .cdr to .iso as these are basically the same.  10) mount the newly created .iso and the mount name should now be whatever the folder name was that you created the image from.....   tada!  Hope this helps....  <answer281921> I created a python script to resolve this exact issue. I saw this post that talks about the offsets that these disk images use. I wasn't able to find a specification, but through some quick research with Hex Fiend I was able to spot them all. It turns out that there are just such offsets for UDF iso images, too. I haven't tested this extensively, but it works on the two images I could find on my system.   The offsets I discovered are:  32808, 65561, 67701, 71765, 98329, 100469 and 104533  You'll need to use terminal and I believe that Python 2 is stock with macOS, so this should work for you.   code./update-names.py myiso.iso/code   It writes irreversibly to your file, so make sure that you have a backup.  Here is the code if you'd like to try it yourself. It's python version 2 (my apologies):  https://gist.github.com/ranvel/bc1d75cc7f9fd74e92630092f4fcda8b
