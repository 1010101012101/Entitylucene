Apple's servers (i.e. all apple.com servers incl. iTunes and App Store) not loading every couple of days <body> Okay, this is a strange one.  Ever since 2017 rolled around I have had this weird situation where I cannot load any pages from an Apple server on one of my iMacs. The strange things about this are:  ul liIt happens using either Safari or Firefox - but Google Chrome works fine/li liThe iTunes Store, Mac App Store, etc are also affected/li liEvery other device on the same network (e.g. iPhones, iPads, MacBook Pros, Apple TV, PCs, etc) all connect fine to these servers (including the same Safari/Firefox browser versions running strongwithin/strong macOS on a virtual machine on the same iMac)/li liThe problem persists regardless of how I connect this particular iMac to a network (i.e. ethernet or Wi-Fi, directly or via a router)/li liAll other web servers (as far as I can tell) load fine/li /ul  Restarting the iMac has no effect, neither does using Safe Mode. Nor did clearing caches, switching off extensions, switching to another user account. I also checked Google Chrome's settings (looking for some sort of DNS caching/prefetching option) to see if I could identify why it works, thinking that would help me troubleshoot the issue - but I didn't see anything obvious.  However, one solution I have found that resolves this issue is:  ul liconnect using a VPN that places me in another country/li liload apple.com in Safari/li lidisconnect from the VPN/li linow all apple servers load fine in Safari strongand/strong Firefox, as well as both the iTunes and App Store apps/li /ul  Unfortunately, within a day or so the problem reappears and again, the only fix I've found is the one above. While this fix only takes about a minute, it is nevertheless frustrating, especially when you're in the middle of a workflow and have to access Apple's servers all the time!  strongDoes anyone have any ideas about this?/strong   emRemember: This affects Safari, FireFox, iTunes and the App Store apps but strongnot/strong Google Chrome? And only those apps on one iMac are affected, but not within macOS on a virtual machine on the same iMac./em  strongSPECS/strong  The iMac in question has the following specs:  ul li21.5" Mid-2010/li li16GB RAM/li liMac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6/li liSafari 10.1 (but since v10.0.2)/li liFireFox 52.0.2 (but since v50.1.0)/li liiTunes 12.6.0.100 (but since v12.5.4.42)/li liApp Store 2.1/li /ul  <comment353636> No I don't, but that's a good idea! I hadn't even thought of installing Wireshark to help troubleshoot this. Will do that now! :) <comment353637> IMHO this is clearly related to some DNS/DNS cache/mDNSResponder issue. In your case Google Chrome  probably uses it's own DNS client and isn't affected. Please check chrome://net-internals/#dns and the state of the "Internal DNS client". <comment353641> Thanks @klanomath -  I'd previously checked Chrome's settings but couldn't find any relevant DNS info to see if it was using Google's own DNS servers etc. But this is a great tip - I'm not a big Chrome user so didn't know you could use _chrome://_ in the address bar to access other info (besides chrome://settings).  I see that the _internal DNS client enabled_ is flagged as `true`, so that confirms my suspicions. Thanks for the tip! :) As an aside, is there a way to change this flag to `false` for troubleshooting purposes? I checked chrome://flags but couldn't find anything. <comment353649> The DNS-async flag was removed. I would draw on LittleSnitch and disable Google Chrome's access to TCP/UDP port 53. Checking my Little Snitch network monitor Chrome accesses the locally configured DNS server(s) and 208.67.220.220 (relation: 1:300 in favor of the Google DNS server)
