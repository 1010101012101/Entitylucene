Is it possible to generate promo codes for in app purchases? <body> I have a free app with one in app purchase option, and I'd like to offer that IAP for free to some helpful users. In iTunes Connect it appears I can generate promo codes but those codes appear to be for the app itself (which, again, is free so I don't get it.)  Google searching brings up all sorts of claims that Apple doesn't allow you to create promo codes for in app purchases, but those threads are a couple of years old now. Can promo codes be created for IAP or is it just for apps themselves?  <answer230792> It's possible since October 28, 2016, see Apple's guide.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nscnh.png" alt="iTunes Connect screenshot"  <comment281780> Couldn't you try and 'hard code it' yourself. I mean create a text input box that takes in a promo code and if code matches what you have stored then do everything that the in app purchase would've done. <comment281785> Yes that's true. Ideally each developer wouldn't have to implement that on each app, but it is a good workaround. <comment325142> This answer is no longer accurate.  You may provide up to 100 promo codes for each in-app purchase. <comment347660> Now getting ITC to actually generate the codes instead of an error... that's another question!
