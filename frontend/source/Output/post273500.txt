How do I fix the tab “Access Control” not opening in Keychain Access? <body> In Keychain Access, I have some items where I cannot open the tab “Access Control”. When I double-click one of these items to open a window on it, the window opens with the tab “Attributes” selected; when I try to click the tab header “Access Control”, the header animates but the tab itself does not open. The tab “Attributes” remains selected.  I am not sure whether it’s related, but in Console I see repeated entries for Keychain Access that say: codeCSSM Exception: -2147413737 CSSMERR_DL_DATASTORE_DOESNOT_EXIST/code. There are also a lot of entries that say: codeCSSM Exception: -2147413750 CSSMERR_DL_INVALID_FIELD_NAME/code.  How can I fix the items so I can open the tab “Access Control” again? I am not sure whether the keychain itself is broken, is there some Terminal command I can use to verify (and repair) it? Or does “Access Control” rely on some other data store that may need repair?  <comment343933> I tried whether moving the items to another keychain (by drag&drop) would help. Yes and no: when in the other keychain, I could open “Access Control” on the items, but when I dragged them back to the original keychain, I no longer could. I also observed odd behavior with the count of items at the bottom of the Keychain Access window: I moved 4 items, but the count went down by 5; it went up again by 5 after dragging the 4 items back. I reverted the keychain to a backup after this, because for now I do not want to wind up breaking it more than it already is by fiddling with it too much.
