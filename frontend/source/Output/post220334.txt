OS X command line installer track progress <body> I am trying to install an application through command line in OS X. This is what I am trying:  precodehdiutil attach app.dmg cd /Volumes/appvolume installer -pkg app.pkg -target "/" /code/pre  This works fine, however, I am not able to get an output from the codeinstaller/code command from which I can capture the amount of progress made and the time/amount remaining. I tried the codeverbose/code option  precodeinstaller -verbose -pkg app.pkg -target "/" /code/pre  But this only prints output like stronginstaller: Optimizing system for installed software…...../strong, etc, nothing about progress. But it surely knows about progress, because when I install the app via double clicking, the installer window that pops up shows a deterministic progress bar that progresses gradually and reaches full length when installation is complete.  Any way I can capture the progress status through command line codeinstaller/code as well?  <answer220337> Sending kbd^/kbd + kbdT/kbd to a running process in Terminal will request the 'status' of that process. This is a hold-over from early BSD and is cross-compatible with most shells (bash, csh, etc.).   A more in-depth conversation with an eye towards Apple specifically can be found here.   <answer220339> You were close - the option you're looking for is -verbosestrongR/strong:  precodeUsage: installer [-help] [-dominfo] [-volinfo] [-pkginfo] [-allowUntrusted] [-dumplog]              [-verbose | -verboseR] [-vers] [-config] [-plist]              [-file &lt;pathToFile&gt;] [-lang &lt;ISOLanguageCode&gt;] [-listiso]              [-showChoicesXML] [-applyChoiceChangesXML &lt;pathToFile&gt;]              [-showChoicesAfterApplyingChangesXML &lt;pathtoFile&gt;]              -pkg &lt;pathToPackage&gt;              -target &lt;[DomainKey|MountPoint] /code/pre  Here's codeinstaller/code's output installing a Firefox 43.0.1 .pkg built with AutoPkgr with that flag:  precodetimmay:~ da4$ sudo installer -pkg /Users/da4/Desktop/auto/Firefox-43.0.1.pkg -target / -verboseR installer: Package name is Firefox-43.0.1 installer: Upgrading at base path / installer:PHASE:Preparing for installation… installer:PHASE:Preparing the disk… installer:PHASE:Preparing Firefox-43.0.1… installer:PHASE:Waiting for other installations to complete… installer:PHASE:Configuring the installation… installer:STATUS: installer:%9.883908 installer:PHASE:Writing files… installer:%30.674055 installer:PHASE:Writing files… installer:%51.530939 installer:PHASE:Optimizing system for installed software… installer:PHASE:Validating packages… installer:PHASE:Validating packages… installer:%97.750000 installer:STATUS: installer:PHASE:Finishing the Installation… installer:STATUS: installer:%100.000000 installer:PHASE:The software was successfully installed. installer: The upgrade was successful. timmay:~ da4$ /code/pre  I'm not exactly sure when the -verboseR option was added to OS X's installer, but it's present in 10.9+.  <comment266649> Sorry I did not understand you. How can I "send" `^+T` to a command in a shell script? <comment266650> With [redirection](http://sc.tamu.edu/help/general/unix/redirection.html). You'll want to look [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21063765/get-pid-in-shell-bash) and [here](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html) to get started. <comment266651> Addendum: I may have misunderstood. If you're sitting looking at a terminal waiting for something to happen, type control and T (together) on the keyboard to get its status. <comment266654> Thanks. While we are at it, can you suggest a way for me to capture the output number whenever the percentage is shown? Say whenever the line `installer:%9.883908` comes along, I want to capture the `9` part and echo it instantly (and suppressing the original output supposed to be given by `verboseR`). Probably I need to use `grep`, I cannot figure out how. That is, the output of my command will be `9`, then `30`, then `51`, etc.. <comment266655> That was very interesting. But not applicable in my problem.. <comment266656> If you wanted to grab the entire percentage, you could use sed: `grep % | sed 's/installer:%//g` - if you wanted to only capture to whole integer, you'd probably have better luck with `awk` <comment266658> Problem is the Mac does not come with GNU sed, so I cannot rely on sed. OSX's version of sed is clumsy.. <comment266659> How so?  `timmay:~ da4$ sudo installer -pkg /Users/da4/Desktop/auto/Firefox-43.0.1.pkg -target / -verboseR | grep % | sed 's/installer:%//g' 7.573892 28.364039 46.844170 95.628934 97.262500 97.750000 100.000000` <comment266660> Lemme try it out then.. <comment266663> Umm, it worked, but not in the way I was expecting it to. It waited for a long time before spitting out any output, and when it did, it immediately outputted `5.30`, `8.12`, etc. unto `100.0` immediately in one go. I did not want this, I wanted `5.30` to come when indeed 5.30 percentage was complete.. <comment266665> I can do it through `awk`: `sudo installer -pkg XQuartz.pkg -target "/" -verboseR | awk '/installer:%/ { print; }'`, and it prints out only those lines with a numbered percentage as it comes. However, I want to capture the integer part of the percentage and spit it out in a formatted way, i.e. for a percentage of `9.21`, I want to print out `Value: 9`. I am unable to do that.. <comment266682> Okay, I made it work by making awk choose multiple delimiters, in this case `%` and `.`, and then printing out `$2`.
