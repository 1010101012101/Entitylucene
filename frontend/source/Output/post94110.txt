iPhone GMail app sometimes shows an icon instead of an email address <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2KcJF.jpg" alt="Image of the email in iOS GMail"  If I tap and hold on the "I" green box, I will copy the "I" and the email address and some other info that looks like this:  precodeinternationalplaza@apple.com to me, internationalplaza 2 days ago Details /code/pre  but I really just want the email address.  The use case is kind of complicated - sometimes people email me and I need to forward them another email from my phone, so I just want to copy their email address so I can paste it into the other forwarded email.  So how can I just copy out the email address or perhaps suppress this display style?  I just want "internationalplaza@apple.com" in my copy buffer.
