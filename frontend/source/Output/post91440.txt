I am having trouble getting apache to work via terminal on mac os x 10.8.3 <body> I am a beginner with the terminal app. - I think , while following a tutorial for creating a user configuration file for apache, that I messed something up internally with apache. I cannot even access the codehttp://localhost//code url  can I revert to a default version of apache somehow? or is there somthing else I need to do?  <comment107383> You question is very generic: it's hard to identify the problem. Please post the last lines of the file `/var/log/apache2/error_log` and tell if you're using the Apache version provided with OS X or if you have installed any other version. Have you edited the configuration files? How? <comment107390> Also, have you had Apache working under OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion before? The method for activating the web server has changed since previous version of the OS. <comment107481> You might be able to restore the default files by deleting /etc/apache2/ (or other modified files) before upgrading to 10.9 or doing an upgrade install of 10.8 from the recovery partition. <comment107486> thanks for all the help. I finally decided to dive into some beginners tutorial for terminal and got it all figured out from there. I turned on the hidden files and went into apache and deleted some botched username.conf files I had made.
