A couple of shortcut keys have stopped working <body> I have noticed that a couple of shortcut keys have stopped working. Thinking it could be another app using the shortcuts I've been into keyboard settings and restored all the default keys. This has not affected the problem.  The issue appears to be happening across different apps (I'm testing in Finder, Safari and my text editor).  Here are some examples: kbd⌘S/kbd for saving strongdoesn't/strong work, but kbd⇧⌘S/kbd for save all strongdoes/strong work. kbd⌘N/kbd for a new window/file (text editor) strongdoesn't/strong work, but kbd⇧⌘N/kbd for new file(Finder)/new private window(Safari)/new window(text editor) strongdoes/strong work.  Particularly kbd⌘S/kbd I use on a regular basis. I tried to add it again:   precodeKeyboard preferences &gt; Shortcuts &gt; App Shortcuts &gt; Add /code/pre  and kbd⌘S/kbd is still not working.   I'm working on a MacBook Pro with an external keyboard. The situation is the same working with the external keyboard connected or directly with the MacBook's own keys.  How can I get the shortcut keys' functionality back?  OS version 10.10.2 (14C1510)  strong--update--/strong  I have also tried swapping the modifier keys over, I set kbd⌘/kbd to kbd⌥/kbd and vice versa - didn't fix the problem.  <answer179145> In trying to debug this issue I assumed that some other program had taken control of these keys. After force-quitting all open applications it did not help.  I then went to Activity Monitor and noticed one of my task bar apps was non-responsive. The app happened to be a clipboard manager (PasteBox). After quitting this app, all lost functionality has returned.
