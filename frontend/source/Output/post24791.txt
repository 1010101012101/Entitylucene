Move all events from one iCal calendar to another <body> I would like to consolidate several iCal calendars.  So, I'm wondering if there is a way to move all events from one iCal calendar to another.  I'm not interested in changing the time, etc. of any of the events, as asked here, and I'm not interested in simply deleting all the events in my calendar, as asked here.  I'm running iCal Version 5.0 (1535) on OS X 10.7.  <answer24801> ul liSelect one of the calendars you want to merge/li lichoose File-Export...-Export/li liMake sure the filename matches the calender you've chosen above. The calendar will be exported to a .ics file/li liChoose File-Import...-Import and find the file you've just saved./li liical will ask you to which calendar it should add the events. Just select the another one of the calendars you want to merge./li lirepeat until all calendars are merged./li /ul  <comment28141> That did the trick...thanks! <comment32476> This didn't work for me. iCal 5.0.1. exported "No Category" imported it specifying Work and the events only show up when No Category is selected under calenders :( k
