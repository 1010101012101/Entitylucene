App not indexed in macOS 10.12.2 Spotlight <body> I launch applications via Spotlight search quite often. For some reason, on my new MacBook Pro 15" with touch bar (late 2016), the Mathematica application is not indexed, nor has it ever been indexed on this machine. (On my previous MacBook Pro, the application was always indexed.) Is there a method by which I can force Sierra to index the application? I have not tried reinstalling the application, as it will be time consuming. Is reinstalling my best option?
