Taking a date and shift time from 2 numbers cells and inputting them into a calendar <body> So here is my issue I am looking for a solution on.   I currently have a numbers document that I use to calculate the hours I work. A simple version of it is like this.  Colum A displays the date. Colum B shows the shift worked.  Colum C shows any over time shift worked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9DM53.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So the first two days are normal shifts the 14th is over time.   Now the idea is that I would like a script or some software that takes the date from colum A, checks the Calender (fantastical or iCal) for an entry. if none exist then take the time from colum b or c and have that as the event title in the Calender for that date.   So after the software has run, I would have a calendar entry on the 14th titled 1200 - 1800  Is this possible on a Mac?
