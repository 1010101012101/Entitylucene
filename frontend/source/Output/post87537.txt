Password problems changing users in Terminal <body> I'd like to switch between the default user in Terminal and the user 'postgres', created when I installed PostgreSQL 9.2.  If I type codesu postgres/code, I'm prompted for a password that I don't know and don't remember ever setting.  I try the root password and it doesn't work.  If I type codesudo su postgres/code, I'm prompted for my root password, which I enter, and that works.  But now, if I try to switch back to the default user using codesudo su user/code, I'm prompted for a password, and the root password does not work.  Neither does the password I use to log into that user in OSX.  I don't understand what's going on here--I've only ever set one password, but the only context in which it seems to work is when switching from the normal user to 'postgres'.  What's going on and how can I fix it?  <answer87541> I think you are mixing several concepts here which leads to some confusion.  ul licodesudo/code required the password of the current user for authorization. So if you run it as yourself, enter your own password. If you run it as codepostgres/code (e.g. after having switched to that user), the password of the codepostgres/code user would be required. As this is most probably not set (and codepostgres/code isn't included in code/etc/sudoers/code either), codepostgres/code won't be able run codesudo/code/li liIn the way you use it, codesudo/code creates a new shell running with the new user. To switch back to the previous user, just exit the shell (kbdCtrl-D/kbd)/li liInstead of using codesudo su &lt;username&gt;/code it might be easier to skip the codesu/code part and just use codesudo -su &lt;username&gt;/code (or just codesudo -s/code if you want to become coderoot/code)/li /ul  In practice I found it much easier to open several tabs in Terminal and log into different users in each tab. This way you don't have to worry about switching back and forth all the time.  hr  From codesudo(8)/code:     If the invoking user is root or if the target user is the same as the          invoking user, no password is required.  Otherwise, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves          with a password by default (NOTE: strongin the default configuration this is the user's password, not the          root password/strong).  Once a user has been authenticated, a time stamp is updated and the user may then          use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden in sudoers)   <answer87542> ul liTo switch to user codepostgres/code, type in Terminal:  precodesudo su - postgres /code/pre  If you are asked for a password, type yours.  (The code-/code in codesudo su -/code changes the environment to that of the new user, and it's probably what you want. See man su for details.)/li liNow, to switch back to your user, simply type:  precodeexit /code/pre  to exit the current bash session and go back to your original bash session./li /ul  Note that if you type codesudo su &lt;user&gt;/code as user codepostgres/code you need to identify yourself to codesudo/code and type codepostgres/code's password, but as you say, it hasn't any, so it won't work. It may even be the case that user codepostgres/code is strongnot/strong allowed to use codesudo/code at all.  <comment102334> `sudo` default configuration (at least in some Linux flavors) requires that the user types the **root password**. For example, from `/etc/sudoers` on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server: `In the default (unconfigured) configuration, sudo asks for the root password.` <comment102335> OS X != Linux :-) <comment102338> I know, seen the man page too, but when I read this in the OP's question: `I'm prompted for my root password` I thought he meant the password for the root user. <comment102339> Good point, but based on the question I would be surprised if the OP really enabled the root account and changed sudoers accordingly. <comment102340> Did you really have to enter the password for the `root` user for `sudo su postgres`? If yes, how did you set this in the first place? <comment102341> Completely agree. Edited my answer accordingly. <comment102378> Thanks very much.  I think I got confused because I'm used to doing this kind of thing in Linux, and I thought it would be the same on OSX.  But you're right--I've never been prompted to create a root password, so my question didn't make that much sense. <comment102380> See my comment above; I was getting my Linux and OSX usage confused.  Thank you both for clarifying.
