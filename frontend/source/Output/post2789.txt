How can I map a middle click to control click? <body> Just started to use a Mac for my new job and not being able to use the middle button to open links in a new tab is killing me. I know I can press control and do a regular click but it's not the same. I know the Mac knows I'm trying to do something because it beeps at me when I press the middle button on my mouse. Is there any hope?    Note I tried the trick about setting expose dashboard to - but it didn't work.  <answer2791> Try holding the kbdCommand/kbd button instead. A kbdCommand/kbd click is a middle click. kbdControl/kbd clicks give you a right click.  What kind of Mac? If you're using a Magic Mouse you can use a program like MagicPrefs to turn a three finger click into a kbdCommand/kbd click. If you're using the Magic Trackpad or the built-in trackpad on a MacBook/MacBook Pro there is a program called MiddleClick I've used that adds a three finger tap/click ability to map to the kbdCommand/kbd click.  <comment2496> I would love to have this for my MacBook Pro.  I use 2 finger tap/click for right clicks and it would be great if control click emulated a middle click! <comment2504> This is where my "answer" was meant to go :) :        I love you Chealion... MiddleClick does the trick for me. I can now close tabs and open links in new tabs with trackpad taps!!! <comment2510> @calavera: Ha! Just glad to help. MiddleClick made life browsing much easier.
