How to remove .DS_Store from command-line auto-completion using cd? <body> I understand that code.DS_store/code files serve a purpose. That said, they are a nuisance when auto-completing with the codecd/code command. When I type codecd/code in Terminal and press tab twice it lists all directories in the working directory.  strongIs there a way of removing code.DS_store/code from this auto-complete directory listing in the terminal?/strong   <answer71402> codeexport FIGNORE=DS_Store/code works for me.  The GNU Bash manual provides extensive information on programmable completion.  Specifically, from the documentation on bash variables     FIGNORE [is a] colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing   filename completion. A file name whose suffix matches one of the   entries in FIGNORE is excluded from the list of matched file names. A   sample value is ‘.o:~’   If you are concerned that there might be existing suffixes in codeFIGNORE/code, then you can use:  precodeexport FIGNORE=$FIGNORE:DS_Store /code/pre  <answer140126> I would use this command:  precodezip -r foo.zip foo -x "*.DS_Store" /code/pre  supFound here: https://superuser.com/questions/198569/compressing-folders-on-a-mac-without-the-ds-store/sup  <answer148836> I think what you're really looking for is context-aware tab completion for Bash commands.  For example, code.DS_Store/code is a regular file, not a directory, so it should not show up as a possible completion to codecd/code.  The package that solves this problem is called codebash-completion/code.  I use Fink's version (codefink install bash-completion/code), and it's also available from MacPorts (codeport install bash-completion/code) and Homebrew (codebrew install bash-completion/code).  After the package is installed and configured in your .bashrc or .bash_profile, regular files will no longer show up as completions for cd, and many other common bash commands become context aware as well (eg. codegunzip/code).  <answer285856> While you're asking about only .DS_Store I think removing all hidden files from autocomplete will be better in general. This can be done by the command:     bind 'set match-hidden-files off'   you can add it ~/.bash_profile to have it invoked every time for you. This will not disable autocompletion for hidden files completely, you still can type '.' (dot) and hit tab for it.  <comment82931> When I type `cd` in Terminal then key Tab twice: there's a prompt before all possibilities (not only directories) are listed. <comment82932> That's seems like better behaviour; Do you know how to prevent listing of files when double tabbing after cd? <comment82933> `cd */` followed by two tabs lists all subdirectories of the current directory. But you have to backspace to select one... <comment82934> @lhf Thanks. It's good to have that option. It would be better if `cd` was smart enough to only list directories by default. <comment165142> How does this solve the problem of removing .DS_Store from autocomplete? <comment165311> Well, actually it does not. But I stumbled upon that page while searching for "mac zip without .DS_STORE". So I thought that maybe it could help someone else. It's probably a bad idea though. <comment222424> Not sure about you, but it had to be `$FIGNORE:.DS_Store` on mac for me. Didn't work without the "." <comment222433> @typeoneerror, same for me. Perhaps in the past it worked as posted. Thanks for letting me know. <comment360625> In macOS Sierra 10.12.5, it works for me only if I omit the `.`
