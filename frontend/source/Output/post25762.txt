After updating oh-my-zsh prompt is weird on startup <body> I have been using the default installation of oh-my-zsh (robbyrussell theme) without issues. I just did a 'git pull' and now on startup I see a weird prompt. As soon as I press any key the prompt becomes normal and I can use the terminal without any issues.  I assume something in the startup script got damaged or changed when I updated or possibly the prompt config?  Here is the contents of the theme file:  precodePROMPT='%{$fg_bold[red]%}&lt;E2&gt;&lt;9E&gt;&lt;9C&gt; %{$fg_bold[green]%}%p %{$fg[cyan]%}%c %    {$fg_bold[blue]%}$(git_prompt_info)%{$fg_bold[blue]%} % %{$reset_color%}'  ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX="git:(%{$fg[red]%}" ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX="%{$reset_color%}" ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_DIRTY="%{$fg[blue]%}) %{$fg[yellow]%}&lt;E2&gt;&lt;9C&gt;&lt;97&gt;%{$reset_color%}" ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CLEAN="%{$fg[blue]%})" /code/pre  I am a Mac OSX and terminal newbie so sorry if it is obvious.  Thanks, Jarrod   <comment29250> What do you actually see? <comment29269> I uninstalled and reinstalled, which resolved the issue. But I was seeing sometimes one '?' sometimes multiple followed by the default cursor (solid rectangle)
