Copying a path of the app to a new directory? <body> I was wondering if someone could help me make an AppleScript that copies the app the script is into another location. So, this is what I tried... (Please don't say anything since I am new at Applescript)  precodeset Folder to "~/Public/" set FdrPosix to quoted form of POSIX path of Folder set newFolderName to "Folder" set destinationFdrPosix to quoted form of FdrPosix &amp; POSIX file newFolderName set sourceFilename to path to me set sourceFnPosix to quoted form of FdrPosix &amp; POSIX file sourceFilename tell application "Finder"   make new folder at alias FdrPosix with properties {name:newFolderName}   copy file sourceFnPosix to folder destinationFdrPosix end tell /code/pre  <comment258729> I would ask what is the overall thing you are trying to achieve - copying the app itself seems a bit odd <comment258740> @Mark Well, I'm doing a project for my school where they want me to create an Applescript to copy an app into a certain folder... I'm not quite sure what it's for, but that's what happens when you join the school's tech club...
