How do I sync tags between two Macs using Google Drive? <body> I have two Macs, and I use Google Drive to sync my data. I created tags in Finder on one Mac for some of the files and directories in Drive, and they don't appear on the other one.  Is this possible? Or are tags restricted to the system they live on and not synced along with the files they apply to?  In case it matters, I don't use iCloud sync, and I'm not willing to turn it on.  <answer192628> I switched to Dropbox because it syncs Finder Tags.  <comment208793> Tags are a Mac OS X feature and have nothing to do with Google Drive. Therefore unless Google Drive specifically enables syncing them somehow, they would not be synced. Since Google Drive itself does not support tags, it would follow that Google Drive does not sync tags. <comment208803> I'm aware that tags have nothing to do with Google Drive, but it depends on how they are implemented. What file metadata does Google Drive sync? Does it sync the extended attributes, for example? If so, and if tags are implemented as extended attributes, then they'll sync. So, it's more nuanced than what you wrote. <comment229293> This question is specifically talking about Google Drive. <comment310445> Is there a reference for the claim that Dropbox syncs Finder tags? I googled, but couldn't find one.
