Terminal command in Applescript not working <body> I am trying to get a terminal command to work in Applescript and I get the error "Expected end of line but found identifier." How can I fix this?  This is my code  precodetry     do shell script "defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}'; killall Dock" with administrator privileges end try  /code/pre  <answer249901> You mustn't use some special characters (e.g. code"/code or code\/code) between the quotation marks after the codedo shell script/code part of Apple Scripts or you have to escape them with a back slash.  In your example the second quotation mark is interpreted as the end of the shell command: codedefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{/code which is no valid line.  So escape the inner quotation marks with a back slash and your Apple Script should work:  precodetry     do shell script "defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{\"tile-type\"=\"spacer-tile\";}'; killall Dock" with administrator privileges end try  /code/pre  If you have a shell command like this:   precode... awk '/disk/ {gsub("\"",""); print $NF}' ... /code/pre  you would have to escape each code"/code and code\/code with a back slash:  precodetry     do shell script "... awk '/disk/ {gsub(\"\\\"\",\"\"); print $NF}' ..." end try  /code/pre  <comment310233> @user3439894 Good question - though not related to the question here. I just copied [a part of an AppleScript answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/207103/93229) containing a lot of `"`s and back slashes. <comment310237> @user3439894 I have tested it. The $ is obligatory in the context of my answer to Tetsujin's question! Now I have to explain it :-O... With NF i get a `10` and with $NF I get `disk2` and I needed some `diskX`result!
