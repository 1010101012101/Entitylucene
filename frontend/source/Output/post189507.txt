Sending apps for the app store. Distribution profile issue <body> So I have an app that was built by vendors, they did everything including submitting the app for the app store. So now I did slight modification to the app and want to update it in the app store. However, an error message pop shows up when we try to archive the app in XCODE. It first says that the team doesn't match then prompt me to click fix it, I clicked fix it but finally it shows this message:  your account has a valid iOS distribution certificate but it is not installed locally.  I'm using xcode 6.2  What does this message mean? and how to fix it?  This is my first hands-on experience in building ios apps and deploying them to app store.  UPDATE: I have installed the development and distribution certificates on my mac machine. Still getting the same error message.  <answer189508> You have to go to https://developer.apple.com and enter in Member Center.  Then:  ul liCertificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles./li liCertificates./li liProvisioning Profiles / Distribution./li liSelect the certificate you want to use and Download./li liDoble click once downloaded to install it./li /ul  That should solve your problem.  <comment224781> I did that to every certificate in the dev center, yet I still get the same message.
