iMessage to iCloud email <body> If I send an iMessage to another persons iCloud email will it appear on their iPhone and desktop? I am concerned about security of the message popping up on other devices than their phone. I am sending from my own iPhone - the iMessage shows delivered but I don't know where it has been delivered to them.  <answer248935> It will appear on all devices switched on &amp; signed into iMessage, that have that email address set as a contactable destination for iMessages.br It is under their control rather than yours.  If, for instance, they have their phone with them but are outside a data reception area [middle of the countryside etc] yet also have their Mac at home running &amp; signed in, it will arrive at the Mac &amp; be shown to you as Delivered [&amp; even as Read if they left Messages open with your view-pane frontmost] - yet they may not actually see it until they get home.
