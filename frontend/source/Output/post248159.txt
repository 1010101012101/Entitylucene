Control packets with pfctl <body> Looking for a way to control precisely which process or application is allowed to communicate with the network in a low connectivity context, I found the codepfctl/code command which seems to be designed for the job.  I would like to allow only a few applications to connect to the network (ie: codeping/code and codeMail/code) and remove emApple/em unnecessary services.  Here is my current code/etc/pf.conf/code file:  precodescrub-anchor "com.apple/*" nat-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "com.apple/*" dummynet-anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "com.apple/*" load anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple" /code/pre  I try to understand the codepfctl/code status with this command:  precode$ sudo pfctl -sr No ALTQ support in kernel ALTQ related functions disabled scrub-anchor "com.apple/*" all fragment reassemble anchor "com.apple/*" all /code/pre  Is it possible to achieve the filtering I want with codepfctl/code and how?  <answer248791> emPF/em (Packet Filter which command line interface of is codepfctl/code) can't do this, because it's not application but port/interface based. You may block port 80/443 for a web browser (like Safari) but this will also block Mail fetching an web-based embedded picture in an email.  Your best bet is to use a host-based application firewall like Little Snitch. The app allows a fine-grained control of outgoing traffic. You may even allow a browser to connect to text based (low traffic) websites while blocking all other sites.  You can even set up several profiles for low- or high-bandwidth locations.
