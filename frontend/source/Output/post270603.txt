MB Pro instantly gobbling up 70+ Gb SSD - How to track culprit? <body> Mac OS 10.10.5, MB Pro 16 GB DDR, 500 Gb SSD.  Probable culprit app MS Excel for Mac 2011?  It seems that when I open up a spreadsheet with stronglots/strong of formulas, within a few minutes I'm getting "Out of Disk Space" warnings. (before starting I have about 66 GB space)  How can I strongverify/strong Excel is the culprit, and how can I manage it, other than buying a (very high priced) bigger SSD? I do keep my trash emptied, usually.  Are there any tools/utilities which show files accessed sorted by bytes-written first, then date?  <answer270621> It sounds like the operating system is swapping out.  Open Activity Monitor from the Utilities folder (inside Applications) and select the Memory tab.  Click on the codeMemory/code category until the little caret arrow points downward.  Then open Excel.  At the bottom, you can see if codeSwap Used/code increases.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vo5YD.png" alt="Activity Monitor"  <answer270896> To find the culprit, you can use a free application called Disk Inventory X. Hope this helps!
