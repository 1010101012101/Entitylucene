Macbook Pro 15" mid2015 HDMI resolution <body> My mid2015 15" Macbook Pro (it has the AMD R9 M370X GPU) should support the following resolutions on the HDMI port:   precode- 1080p resolution at up to 60Hz - 3840-by-2160 resolution at 30Hz - 4096-by-2160 resolution at 24Hz /code/pre  However, when I connect a EIZO 1920 x 1200 display on the HDMI port, it is not detected and nothing happens.   Does that mean that mean the MBP cannot use other resolutions on the HDMI port than the ones specified? Do you see a way I could make the screen work on HDMI?
