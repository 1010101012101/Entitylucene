Then try resetting the device. Hold down the home and button and the top button until the device restarts.   Then go to the app store and download it from your "updates". If this does not work, repeat the process and attempt to download the app from the regular search results or from the top grossing apps within the app store.  <comment205481> Your tablet is an iPad, I assume? <comment205617> Please see my comment below. This is the fix as I have used it on three of my own devices and used it to help others with the same problem as well.
