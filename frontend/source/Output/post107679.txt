How can I use SMB shares under Mavericks? <body> There seem to be different problems and solutions to this problem floating around:  ol liFix switching from SMB to cifs/li liNot being able to access OS X shares from Windows/li liAll kinds of problems with SMB and Mavericks over at Apple/li /ol  My problem is like in the first link: I have a Raspberry Pi (Linux) SMB server. It serves files to my MBP running Mavericks. However, I cannot connect to the Pi. The Console logging says:  precode30.10.13 21:50:53,422 NetAuthSysAgent[6632]: smb_mount: mount failed to raspberrypi/MyShare, syserr = File exists /code/pre  When I go to code/Volumes/code in a shell and do an codels/code, I get this:  precodeuser@mac:/Volumes $ ls -l ls: MyShare: Invalid argument total 8 lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  1 28 Okt 21:39 M4 -&gt; / user@mac:/Volumes $  /code/pre  So my main hard drive M4 is visible, the share produces an invalid argument. I already rebooted my Mac three times.  How can I solve this?   <answer107899> If you can't get SMB working, try AFP. You can run both side-by-side, and use SMB on your Windows and AFP on OS X.  hr  To set up AFP on your Raspberry Pi, you can use the following command:  precodesudo apt-get install netatalk /code/pre  This will install Netatalk on your RPi, and following successful installation, the RPi should automatically show in the Shared section in Finder and the Network neighbourhood (⌘⇧K):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNcW2.png" width="150"  supIf not, you can connect manually by pressing ⌘K and typing codeafp:///code followed by the IP address of your RPi./sup  <answer115707> This post solved my problem. Try manually setting the maximum transmission unit under your system settingsNetworksWLAN/EthernetAdvancedHardwareCustom MTU of 1320.  My Problem was also a mounting delay problem. Once I got things mounted, everything worked normally. Apparently, the default MTU is too high. Manually lowering this made mounting smb shares a much faster process.  The original post I will paste here for the sake of keeping stackexchange self-contained:     I have embarked on a testing mission... Using Wireshark I managed to   see that packets were being dropped when transferring over the network   - the same patterns didn't exist with the same transfer over wireless or the same transfer wired to a Windows server.      So I Googled a little and came up with the following command:      ping -c 1 -D -s 1500 smbserver      It basically pings the server with an MTU of 1500, to which I got:      ping: sendto: Message too long      Note that I also get this error on a Windows server - but what may be   the issue is that when your software gets this response it is supposed   to automatically decrease the MTU until it finds the optimal one for   transfer of packets - something that Mavericks appears to be doing   with Windows servers but not with Linux ones.      So using the ping command I can find an optimal MTU for transfer:      ping -c 1 -D -s 1320 smbserver      Now I get the answer:      round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.829/0.829/0.829/0.000 ms      I had to mess around trying to find the optimal level but it gives you   an idea on the test.  After this I take my number and go to:      System Preferences - Network - USB Ethernet - Advanced... -   Hardware - Configure: Manually - MTU Custom: 1320      After this, I disconnected my shares, re-established them and then   tried another transfer up to my Linux server.  Success! Granted it's   not what I'd deem to be full speed, but to get a 5GB transfer down   from 8 hours to 30 minutes seems better.   It has taken it from   completely unusable to tolerable.      I'm not entirely sure what the root of the problem is as I'm not a   networking expert, as the stepping back of MTU appears to work on a   Windows server and not a Linux one, and it worked fine in previous   versions of OS X, my guess is that it is driver and/or stack related.      BTW I tried updating to 10.9.1 via the Developer download before   trying this, the 10.9.1 upgrade didn't fix the issue for me before I   went troubleshooting.   <comment126273> Out of interest, is there a reason you are using SMB over AFP on your RPi? <comment126321> Yes, I also have Windows machines on my network. :) <comment126360> Would you consider using SMB on Windows and AFP on Mac? :) <comment126390> Oh well... Maybe I'll try it, just because I never used AFP! However, after the fourth reboot everything works -- for now! I'll keep an eye on this problem, and will try to formulate a useful answer. <comment126537> Yup, I just set up AFP, and it works great. Do you want to write an answer? <comment126549> Done! :) I've added some more information about setting up Netatalk in case anyone else finds this question. <comment132255> After a month of usage, I can say this works fine. But it seems actually best to name the AFP server differently than the SMB server. I changed the netbios name in smb.conf, but you could also change the name in netatalk's afp_signature.conf.
