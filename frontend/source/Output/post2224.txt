Why can't I add or edit contacts on my new iPhone 4? <body> On my new iPhone 4, I can add a new contact after talking to them (Add as new contact) but I cannot otherwise add new contacts, or edit existing ones.  It looks like a bug.  Is there a way to work around it, or do I have to wait for Apple to fix their issue?  The phone is not jailbroken.  <answer2225> You can use the Contacts application provided in the iPhone 4, and create/edit contacts in there.  <answer2226> What's preventing you from doing so?  The ability to add and edit contacts from the phone app is still available.  I tested this just now on mine.  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1515174/iphone-add-contacts.jpg  <answer28154> just go to settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  if there is a accont (hotmail, g mail etc.) just delete the account and then  automatically you can start adding contacts  <answer28591> It seems that the problem occurs when adding contacts to these phones after updating to IOS 5 (the + sign on the corner right is missing).  IOS 5 added iCloud and if your contacts are not turned ON from the iCloud settings, you won't be able to add, edit or delete contacts.  The Fix: turn ON your iCloud contacts settings from Settings  iCloud and you should see your + sign on the corner back again.  <answer28845> I had the exact same problem. Go to settings, then iCloud, go to the 'contacts' switch and set it to 'on' and it will fix your problem immediately.   <comment1873> I'm not sure I understand your question. Can you add some more detail please? I can add and edit contacts just fine with my iPhone 4 as I did with my 3G. <comment1874> Perhaps it is because I restored a backup from my old 3GS to the new phone?  Either way, the + button in the Contacts app isn't there, and neither is the Edit button when I look at a contact... <comment1875> On a brand-new iPhone 4, the Contacts application is the only built-in application on the *second* app screen. Swipe to the right and you should see it. <comment1876> I can't do that; the + button is missing on mine! <comment1877> Are you syncing your contacts with any sources?  Please check Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars and see if any accounts say "Contacts" underneath. <comment32253> -1 - how on earth is "it works on mine" a valid answer? (Except, even though I've got 20k+ global rep, I still can't downvote here. So it's in spirit only) <comment32275> There is an issue. When going through the contacts app I am unable to add, edit or delete contacts. I also tried going through my text messages to edit the contact from there and was unable to. But if I go through the phone app and select favorites or numbers that I have recently called, then I am able to edit those contacts. Is this a minor glitch? Before the new software update to my iPhone 4 I was able to edit contacts through selecting my contact book and through txt messages. <comment32316> Make sure Contacts is closed and removed from the multitasking menu (double tap home button). Then open it and take a screenshot (power + home button). Post that screenshot please. <comment34509> an anonymous commenter adds this: " this just deletes your mail account... see below answers regarding icloud settings for IOS5 and above... I followed this step and now having to re-configure my mail settings...." <comment35233> Citing sources is a helpful practice for tips like this.
