How can I operate 2 XServes and 2 iMacs from 1 keyboard and 1 mouse (both bluetooth)? <body> I have 2 Xserves and 2 iMacs.  I would like to control them with 1 Apple wireless keyboard and one Apple Magic Mouse.  I have seen a device from IOGear a Bluetooth 2.1 USB Micro Adapter,  which made me wonder if something like the following could work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUzZ8.png" alt="Overview"  To do this I would need two 1 x 4 passive usb hubs with some kind of electronic or mechanical switch.  Then, plugging the bluetooth to usb adapters into each such device I could pair the keyboard or mouse with the respective bluetooth to usb adapter.  Do any such switchable usb hubs exist?  Could I use anything else?  Since I can readily share the displays of my iMacs via a mini dvi connection to the XServes I don't really need a full blown KVM device.  I saw a post on this site that recommended Synergy to do something like this, but as I don't have dedicated monitors for the servers, it does not look like a good solution for me.  Any other solutions welcome.  Thanks in advance.  <answer42184> I use a combination of synergy for my laptop (macbook pro), and workstation (ubuntu linux). To get to my servers (some freebsd, some linux) I use just SSH, but if I need an X session I can export it over ssh. As Lyken mentions, ARD is the way to go. VNC is more crossplatform, but since you're running all Macs, its a piece of piss to get working.   Synergy would be worth a go with your two iMacs.   With that setup, you won't need any extra hardware, just a working network.  <answer42220> Actually, it looks like this may work, as noted here Share your Magic Mouse between 2 Macs.  This should be able to be extended to where both the keyboard and the mouse are Bluetooth and replacing the KVM with a USB switch.     For the setup we used the following hardware:      ul   li1 mac mini (running 24/7 as a home server)/li   li1 Mac Pro (itâ€™s a hackintosh inside a Mac Pro case)/li   li1 Apple USB Keyboard and 1 dual-link DVI Monitor/li   li1 Apple Magic Mouse (Bluetooth)/li   li1 Belkin Flip KVM Switch (DVI-D 2-Port)/li   li1 small Bluetooth 2.0 USB dongle/li   /ul   <comment47944> Is ARD not an option? <comment47962> Do you experience any latency when using ARD or Synergy? <comment47980> You should be able to do this with only one USB bluetooth adapter and USB switch <comment48008> For Synergy, not at all. VNC/ARD, some but its exporting a whole screen, so it has to round trip with the image. Synergy is only sending mouse/keyb movements.
