Does anyone know a Socks5 server I can run in OsX which allows chaining to an HTTP proxy? <body> Does anyone know of an OSX (Lion) Socks5 proxy that allows chaining to an HTTP(s) proxy with authentication?  I've been searching the web, but can't seem to find anything.  <answer73716> A lot of searching around, and I finally found cntlm which works quite well.  There is a slight build problem with v0.92.3 when compiling with Lion and XCode 4.5.1 - there is a make error that it does not recognize "-Wno-unused-but-set-variable".  Just comment out that warning from the Makefile, and it compiles and runs well.
