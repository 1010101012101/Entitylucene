Disable Growl Notification When a Certain App is Running <body> Is there a way to disable Growl notifications automatically when a certain app is running, Quick Time for example. I don't want to get the notifications while watching a movie.  <answer13910> Full credit to @ghoppe over at Super User for this excellent answer.  I'm only duplicating it here because a moderator on Meta suggested that it would be appropriate to do so.  Please note that this solution will suppress Growl when strongVLC/strong (media player) is running.  To make it work for another application (e.g. QuickTime), you'll have to modify the Applescript.  If you've tried yourself but still need help, I would suggest posting a question about it over at Stack Overflow.  Original answer follows:  hr     Enter in Applescript Editor, save as application, when saving check the box "Stay Open". Use this new applescript application to launch the VLC application.      Description: It will launch VLC, turn off growl notifications, check every 2s to see if VLC has quit, if so it will turn growl notifications back on and then quit. As a bonus, it will use growl notifications to notify you when growl notifications will be turned on or off.   precodeglobal Growl_was_Loaded     global VLC_is_Loaded      on run         set Growl_was_Loaded to isAppLoaded("GrowlHelperApp")         set VLC_is_Loaded to isAppLoaded("VLC")         launchVLC()         idle     end run      on idle         set x to isAppLoaded("VLC")         if x and not VLC_is_Loaded then             launchVLC()         else if VLC_is_Loaded and not x then             set VLC_is_Loaded to false             if Growl_was_Loaded then                 tell application "GrowlHelperApp" to launch                 growl_notify("Growl notifications have been turned ON")             end if             tell me to quit         end if         return 2 -- wait 2 seconds     end idle      on launchVLC()         tell application "VLC" to launch         if Growl_was_Loaded then             growl_notify("Launching VLCâ€¦ Growl notifications have been turned OFF")             delay 1             tell application "GrowlHelperApp" to quit         end if         set VLC_is_Loaded to true     end launchVLC      on isAppLoaded(app_name)         tell application "System Events"             set app_list to every application process whose name is app_name             if the (count of app_list) &gt; 0 then                 set x to true             else                 set x to false             end if         end tell         return x     end isAppLoaded      on growl_notify(msg)         tell application "GrowlHelperApp"             set the allNotificationsList to {"Growl Toggler"}             register as application "Growl Toggler" all notifications allNotificationsList default notifications allNotificationsList             notify with name "Growl Toggler" title msg description "" application name "Growl Toggler" icon of application "Automator"         end tell     end growl_notify     /code/pre  <comment14819> It looks like this has already been answered over at Super User: http://superuser.com/questions/143703/is-it-possible-to-somehow-hide-growl-and-herald-when-vlc-runs-fullscreen <comment14856> Made it a community wiki so I don't get credit for someone else's answer.

I'll post the result. <comment19378> Gee thanks @Austin. :)
