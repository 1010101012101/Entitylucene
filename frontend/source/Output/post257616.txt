Connection problems with Magic Mouse 2 while wifi is on (MBP2012) <body> I have a modified mbp 2012 with a Samsung 256GB 850 EVO and 16gb ram. I recently upgraded my mouse to a Magic Mouse 2, but so far it isn't the best upgrade ever!  I'm having struggles to connect my mouse after shutdown of the mouse or MBP. I can only reconnect it to bluetooth after disabling wifi.  Are there any solutions to this problem without having to disable anything? I have heard of a possible solution involving  disabling of hotspot with an Iphone, but i have to use that sometimes.  Thanks for reading, and hoping for a reply :-)   Edit: I'm currently running macOs Sierra 10.12  <answer271775> Disabling the hotspot with an iphone seems like the only option. Had it running for a few months without any problems now.
