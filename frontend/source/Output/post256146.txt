Does Apple TV 4 not show photo albums which are arranged in folders? <body> I'm using a MacBook with the Photos application and I'm using the iCloud photo library. I've created several albums from my timelined photos. Also I've created some folders where I moved albums with the same photo type in. So when I click on Albums in the Photos application, I will see some Albums, and some folders which contains Albums. The works flawlessly on all devices I've used so far. But now I realized that Apple TV 4, even with the latest software update, only show albums from the root, but neither folders, nor the albums within my folders. Is it only me, or is this a general problem with the current Apple TV 4?  Thanks Atmananda
