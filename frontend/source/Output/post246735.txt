Can sleep password and screensaver password timeout settings be different? <body> In El Capitan, is there a way to separate the request for password when the computer wakes from sleep from the request for password for stopping the screensaver?  See System Preferences -- Security &amp; Privacy -- General tab: checkbox for "Require password  after sleep or screen saver begins."  I would like to keep the password request after the computer wakes from sleep, but I don't want a password to stop the screensaver.  <answer246738> No this isn't possible.  Nonetheless, this would be a great general security improvment for MacOS X. For example since I type it pretty regularly but in a safe context, I would like to have an independant password to unlock my screensaver.  I suggest you to make your question a good proposal of security improvment on the Apple feedback web server, section about MacOS X, since they didn't yet put in place a section about security feedback.  <comment304390> thanks Daniel, I will use the feedback server
