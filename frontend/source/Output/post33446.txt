Remove recent documents history? <body> I recently got a macbook air and am getting used to the mac os interface... Liking it so far but still relearning how to do some basic stuff.  For example, right clicking on VLC, and all the pr0n I've been watching comes up! Don't want to risk that popping up if someone else is using my computer for a few moments.  I've tried setting the Number of recent items under system preferences to none, but vlc still remembers all my filthy video titles! What gives?  In windows I could clear my recent documents easily enough, or use a tool like ccleaner to clear system cache, browser histories, recent documents etc with one click.  Can you recommend something similar for mac?   (I know the best solution for this is separate user accounts - but would like to be confident that I could pass my laptop quickly to someone at a moments notice without all my recent activity being 2 clicks away!   Thanks for any help.  <answer33447> There's always the emClear Menu/em items:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjWnR.png" alt=""  hr  This would remove most of the property lists that store recent documents:  precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/*LSSharedFileList.plist /code/pre  (Applications keep the old list of recent items until they're reopened though.)  <answer64265> In addition to using the emClear Menu/em items in Finder and various applications, you can delete the global list of Recent Places that show in all open &amp; save dialogs.  precodedefaults delete NSGlobalDomain NSNavRecentPlaces /code/pre  You do not need to be root for this. It deletes the codeNSNavRecentPlaces/code key from code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code.  <answer105646> As per the article Clear and manage recent places in OS X on CNET, this command in terminal  precodedefaults write -g NSNavRecentPlacesLimit -int 0 /code/pre  will eliminate this from your machine.  <answer144601> There is an easy fix to this...  precode1. Go to System Preferences 2. General 3. On Recent Items, Select None /code/pre  <answer178091> I know EXACTLY what you are referring too... I actually found the answer and it was simple! I didn't like when I opened my finder, that all of my recent documents were listed there...especially since my work computer is not facing in a favorable position to people walking behind me.  I didn't need a long list of my resumes and cover letters showing for everyone to see.  Here's where I found the answer.  http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/os-x-turning-off-all-my-files  <answer221621> Open VLC, go to File-Open Recent- Clear menu, this will clear the menu even when right clicking the dock icon.  <answer259457> From the command line...  precodedefaults delete com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList RecentDocuments defaults write com.apple.Preview NSRecentDocumentsLimit 0  defaults write com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList RecentDocuments -dict-add MaxAmount 0  killall Dock /code/pre  Got it from here.  Actually works.  <answer261392> Ok, so none of the described methods actually succeeded in getting rid of emall/em the 'recent document' lists in emall/em of my apps.   I feel the most common sense approach would be (for OSX 10.12 / Sierra):  ol liFirst go to system settings  general and choose "none" in the recent file dropdown menu (my OSX is in another language so the exact terms might be different, but you should be able to see what I mean). / This will get rid of most, but not all recent-items in different apps./li liGet familiar with Apple's 'defaults' command in terminal. Now, hunt for any lists you might still want to get rid off, e.g. none of the options mentioned in the answers already listed here helped to get rid of the recent-items list in Finders "GO" menu. I played around with the defaults command and found that: "strongemwrite com.apple.finder "FXRecentFolders" '({})' &amp;&amp; killall Finder/em/strong" does the trick for me. Playing around I found similar solutions for many of the other apps that where still able to maintain a list of recent items. /li liCreate a shell script containing the commands you found during step 2. /li liSchedule the script to be run automatically on a preset interval or action (e.g. log out). strongAND/OR/strong create an alias in your shell's profile (or directly apply the script as a function inside it) so you can call it with a single command from your terminal. (for instance: I have created an alias to it, so when I now type "killrecent" in terminal, it empties all the recent-items lists I've been able to find. /li /ol  Hope this will be of some help to others. Good luck!   <answer261621> For VLC on MAC:  Preferences - Show all - Interfaces - Main Interfaces - macosx - remove the option "list recent objects".  Maybe menu labels are not accurate, as my Mac is setup in Spanish, but I hope it helps.  <comment38127> Up vote because you're being honest about why you want the history to disappear! <comment38129> Nevertheless the better way would be to enable the guest account and switch to the login screen whenever somebody wants to use your computer. <comment38130> +1 to Patrix who provided a quick, workable answer. Don't know why Patrix didn't put that as an answer. <comment38141> I did acknowledge user accounts in the question however this is about quickly handing my laptop to someone, not for an extended period of time. Closing all my apps is overkill for this use case. <comment99387> I can not find that clear menu. Could you please tell me where it is? <comment99388> Ok. Apple-- Recent-- Clear. But that does not remove files as asker wants. :-( <comment170336> This only gets rid of things under the `Apple Logo  Recent Items` list. It wouldn't, for example, clear your Safari history or the VLC recent items history. Those histories are maintained per-application. <comment170493> Ian C, it does in fact clear VLC recent items history.  You're correct that "recently opened files" has nothing to do with Safari history, but that wasn't the question. <comment210878> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment234989> @Mark, if you switch users to Guest User, you don't need to close anything (except perhaps for performance reasons).  To get back to your regular account, the user would need to have your password. <comment259501> After I removed the `*LSSharedFileList.plist` file, I had to log out and then log in again to make the recent documents disappeared. <comment313966> Need to restart computer? <comment314520> Why does this answer only have two upvotes? It was really helpful. Thanks! <comment341078> I feel like this option is the "hammer to kill a mosquito" route. You'll find that things like Numbers, etc. won't have any recent items if you do this.
