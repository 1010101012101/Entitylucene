Saving a shortcut / redirect link to the Home Screen <body> I've got a certain 'system' I'd like to set up. However, for convenience, I'd like to be able to save a redirect shortcut (such as a shortened bit.ly URL). However, the only method I know of adding a shortcut to the Home Screen is by visiting the page. What's the dilemma? It automatically redirects me, leaving no time to save the shortcut to the Bit.ly page directly.  When trying to save a shortcut to another website, it lets you change the name of the link, but not the URL it links to.  How would I accomplish this? For example, by saving this redirect to my Home Screen. A similar situation would be how the iTunes app links redirect you to the app store.  <comment208610> Just curious... why would you want to save the shortcut url instead of the destination? <comment208614> Not revealing specifically, however one common example is when iTunes redirects you to the app-store. <comment208675> Sounds a bit suspicious. Why don't want you to reveal why or the URL to other users? <comment211058> Why does it matter how suspicious it seems? If I was intelligent enough to perform a malicious act, I wouldn't be asking it here. <comment369687> I want to add a bit.ly link to my homescreen, so that I can track how often I open it
