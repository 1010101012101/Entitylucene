How to search Library on Mavericks <body> Before updating to 10.9 I frequently deleted all the small files some apps leave behing by searching for invisible system files. Now it doesn't seem to work, I can navigate to the file manually just fine, but it doesn't show up in the search. Is there a way to index Library?  <answer139254> Are you searching via command-f within Finder? If so, do you see a pair of dropdowns that say codeKind is Any/code? Click codeKind/code and select codeSystem files/code. codeAny/code will change to codearen't included/code. Click it and change it to codeare included/code.  If codeSystem files/code isn't available in the first dropdown, select the last item, codeOtherâ€¦/code, and find it in the subsequent popup.   If no dropdowns are shown, click the round code+/code button on the right edge of the Finder window, near its top.   If you're searching via Menubar  Spotlight, I've looked in the past for a way to include hidden files in its search results, but to no avail.   Personally, I use App Cleaner, by the way, to tidy junk left by messy apps.   strongADDENDUM:/strong   I see now this works for most codeLibrary/code files, like those found in codeApplication Support/code or codeInternet Plug-ins/code, but it fails specifically for code.plist/code files found in the codePreferences/code sub-folder. Not sure why Apple would do that.   Others have had this difficulty, too, and they've solved using App Cleaner or a similar third-party app:   http://lifehacker.com/5711409/how-to-search-for-hidden-packaged-and-system-files-in-os-x http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1599438 http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20121101064200135  It seems the options are third-party app, manually search through Finder, or perhaps codegrep/code through Terminal. Regardless, remember to leave http://www.apple.com/feedback/.  <comment164235> Yes, that's my search pattern. Like I said, I can navigate to the file manually just fine, so I KNOW it's there, but it doesn't come up while searching. I don't use cleaner apps, because after testing a bunch of them I always found that they leave stuff behind. Besides, they don't work if the app has been long gone, and now I'm just trying to delete the leftovers. <comment164249> Ah, now I see. I've updated my answer above.
