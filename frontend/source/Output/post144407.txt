Spotlight searched an image and it automatically edited itself <body> I have DropBox installed on my Mac. In my DropBox folder are two specific images, which we'll call Image A and Image B.  I was using Spotlight Search for Image A, and used the spotlight preview pane. To my surprise, the image was messed up-- it gave me a preview where Image B was literally 'pasted over' Image A.   emWeird,/em I thought. So I clicked on the DropBox icon to check the images in the folder itself, and on the Recently Changed pane DropBox has, it read: strong"Last edited: Image A. 20 seconds ago."/strong  Did Spotlight search have some weird bug that merged my images together automatically? I did not touch those images before today.
