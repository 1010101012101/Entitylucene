"The document could not be saved" - Preview error <body> I am running macOS Sierra(version 10.12.1). This is the version info for Preview.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0uvF.png" alt="enter image description here"  I get this error message(not all the time) a lot after editing an image, and trying to save it.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1qcqJ.gif" alt="gif" I can't quit Preview either, so the only way to close Preview for me when this happens is to force quit Preview.  I don't want to click on duplicate when prompted for two reasons:  ol liMy edits made to the original document don't carry over./li liIt doesn't solve the problem of Preview not quiting./li /ol  <comment326605> Why don't you press Duplicate when prompted? - Wouldn't that give you the possibility of specifying a new path and name for the file? <comment326606> The thing with duplicate, is that it doesn't copy the changes I made. It also doesn't solve the problem of quitting preview. <comment326607> The original document that you edited - where was it stored in the first place? In iCloud Drive or? <comment326608> Saved on my desktop <comment326609> I have seen others comment on similar cases that you could try removing the extended ACLs on the folder. I don't know if you really want to do that on the desktop folder, but it could be worth looking into.
