Why isn't Alt-Tab working for switching windows of the same app? <body> In my MacBook Pro running Lion, I use kbdCommand/kbd + kbdTab/kbd to switch apps, and kbdAlt/kbdsup1/sup + kbdTab/kbd for switching windows within an app.  In my work iMac, also running Lion, kbdAlt/kbd + kbdTab/kbd isn't doing anything, and I can't find any setting for that. Also, I dont remember tweaking anything in the MacBook Pro to get this to work.   emnote sup1/sup - kbdAlt/kbd is the same as kbdOption/kbd on most Mac keyboards, but mine just has kbdAlt/kbd printed./em  <answer42700> kbdOption/kbd+kbdTab/kbd shouldn't be assigned to switching windows by default. You could've reassigned it in the Keyboard preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zeLba.png" alt=""  It could also be handled by some third party app like Witch, LiteSwitch X, or Keyboard Maestro on the MacBook Pro.  <answer42712> Try kbdCommand/kbd + kbd~/kbd (tilde). That is the default.  <answer43179> On german Keyboard Layouts changing windows of an app is mapped to kbdCommand/kbd + kbd&lt;/kbd and kbdCommand/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd&lt;/kbd respectively.  <answer127468> Mavericks use Command + Tab to switch between the application but if you want to cycle through the different window of same application use this: Command + Tab + DownArrow it will show all the open windows of the same application which you can select using arrow keys.  <answer236517> Use Hyperswitch.  I just stumbled on this posting now, and did some digging and found this nice "new" app.  https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch  Works well for me (basically turns your mac's application-switching into a windows-style task-switching environment &lt;- much more intuitive especially when working w/ multiple screens/spaces).  <comment48544> Thanks! I dont remember having done that, but whatever. I reccomend this shortcut, its very convenient to have command + tab and alt + tab so close to one another <comment48555> Just for the record `Command` + ` (the key above tab) works really well for me. <comment48659> This is not default behaviour on your MBP.  Somebody must've changed the default key mapping. <comment200043> I have a german MBP15 Retina with english keyboard. CMD-~ didn't work, but CMD-shift- does. CMD- does other things, though. Thank you. <comment200046> Ah, of course I had to add shift:  is a shift character :-) <comment248482> command + ~ does absolutely nothing on my 2015 Macbook Pro. <comment268363> Note, however, that it won't cycle to minimized windows. <comment289445> ugh there has to be an easier way to do this... <comment289447> found it: https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch :)
