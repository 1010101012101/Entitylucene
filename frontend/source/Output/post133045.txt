MacBook Pro display turns black when unplugging external HDMI monitor <body> Whenever I unplug my HDMI monitor, my MacBook Pro (mid-2010) display turns black. This persists through reboots. Is there a way to reset the display settings for my laptop?   I've tried resetting the display cache (option-command-p-r when rebooting), without success.  I am running Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9.3.   <comment157593> What kind of external monitor are you using? VGA, DVI, DisplayPort, HDMI, Thunderbolt, USB 3? <comment157657> it's an HDMI based monitor <comment157680> Does it flash black for a second or for an extended period of time? It's normal for the internal display to flash for a second after unplugging external. Additionally, you can attempt to [reset the SMC](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) <comment159108> it turns immediately black, and stays black. rebooting the computer and/or hard resetting the vram (as listed above) don't make a difference (ie, unplug external monitor, reboot, laptop screen shows apple logo but immediately turns black afterwards) <comment338303> The same thing started happening to me on my late 2013 macbook pro retina, with Sierra 10.12.2.
