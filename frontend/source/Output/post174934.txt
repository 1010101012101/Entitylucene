How to change the default Calendar alert to be an email instead of a message? <body> In Calendar on Yosemite, I want to change the default Calendar alert to an email.  I know how to access the default calendar alerts, but those only allow me to change when the message alert pops up, not whether it's a message or an email.  I'd rather not have to create a custom alert for every single calendar event I create.  I know I could use Google Calendar as my main calendar, as it allows me to configure the default alerts I want, but I'd to keep everything in my Mac Calendar.
