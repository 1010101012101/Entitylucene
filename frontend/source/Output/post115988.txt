iPhone 4s receives blank SMS when message contains special or international characters <body> The iPhone 4s purchased some time ago outright through a budget carrier (Cricket in the US) is having issues receiving messages that contain, I can only assume, non-ASCII characters. If the message contains special symbols (such as proper typography like ’ or —) or foreign language (Cyrillic in my case, not sure about Latin-based scripts with funky letters or other non-Western alphabets) it just receives (or shows) it as blank, empty message.  I’ve looked through the settings, but could not find any pertaining to encoding or the like, and I am generally unfamiliar with iOS (this is not for me, it’s for a friend, you see). I’ve tried to send them from my PC, and from Android phone as well with the same results. At the same time my other friend with iPhone (4s as well, if I remember correctly) from the major carrier (AT&amp;T) had no problem receiving these messages.
