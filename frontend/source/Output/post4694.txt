iphone upgrade - did it back up? <body> strongIf/strong you tell iTunes to upgrade your iPhone from os4 to os4.versionupdate (example)...  strongDoes/strong iTunes automatically back it up before attempting upgrade?  my phone is currently in recovery mode - and I don't know whether it backed up or not (you rookie!!!)  strongEDIT/strong I have browsed to the back up folder, i.e.   codeC:\Users\&lt;MY USERNAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup/code  There is a folder with todays date: code\a6fbdb939e60771c51f18a68a41e8e0e2d230dcc/code - would this be the backup done before attempting software upgrade?  <answer4695> iTunes creates a backup of your iPhone everytime you sync it, not only when you upgrade it.  If in doubt, sync the iPhone before upgrading.  Here is an Apple Support article about the subject: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766  <answer4731> iTunes definitively creates a backup before upgrading. The folder you see seems to be this backup.  <comment4567> ty tho did mention i had already upgraded, will always sync in future
