USB drive ignores user id and group id on OS X 10.10 <body> I want a mounted USB drive to honor the user id and group id. OS X 10.10 automatically mounts the USB drive when it is plugged in. It totally strongignores/strong the user and group ids on the drive and stronglies/strong about what they are! i.e., it always displays the current user and group id, never mind what is on the disk. Even worse, when writing files it will put some strongnonsense/strong user and group id that have no obvious meaning, typically [99:99].  This is a problem when I mount the drive on a Linux machine, which won't allow reading or writing these files unless user/group match or the file has other r/w bits set.  I use this for backup and changing the permissions so other can read is strongnot/strong an option!  On OS X 10.5, I could put a line in /etc/fstab and the os would strongnot/strong automount the drive. I could then mount it with: diskutil mount and it would work properly. fstab is strongtotaly/strong ignored on 10.10.   How do I get OS X to mount the USB drive to stronghonor/strong the user and group ids?  More Info:br Putting noauto in /etc/fstab still works. There was no /etc/fstab on my system when I got it. Using "sudo vifs" creates it. /etc/fstab.hd strongdoes/strong exist! It says "IGNORE THIS FILE." and other warnings. Thus, I thought fstab was useless.  Unfortunately, with the noauto in fstab, I can not mount the drive at all! "diskutil mount my-disks-uuid" gives an error:     Volume on disk2s2 failed to mountbr   If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option   Note: if I remove the noauto from fstab, the drive still mounts fine!  I ran diskutil on the USB stick and it said the USB drive was damaged. I clicked repair, and it now verifies OK. Unfortunately, it still strongwill not/strong mount! (automount still works OK)  Added 2015-Sep-14  I have found a solution: USB drives are automounted with noowners set. The -u option of the mount command can change this to owners: sudo mount -u -o owners /dev/disk2s2 /Volumes/rocket  Before mount -u gives: /dev/disk2s2 on /Volumes/rocket (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)  After mount -u gives: /dev/disk2s2 on /Volumes/rocket (hfs, local)  The 99:99 ids are still not quite right. When mounted, these displayed as the current user, NOT 99! Doing a chown on a file that is 99:99 does NOT change them! You need to delete the file and copy it back, to fix the uid and gid.  Oddly, even root can't change the user and group ids. This is probably because root is NOT the owner of the directory and can't cd to it. I think this is related to the fact that this is an EncFs on OSXFuse partition.  I solved the chown problem by recursively changing owner to sys admin, then recursively changing to the correct owner.  hr  2015 Sep 25  Broke again!  Specifically, the "mount -u -o owners" command does not work on USB flash drives formatted on OS X 10.10! It worked fine on my old USB drive formatted on OS X 10.5.  On OS X 10.10, "mount -u -o owners" gives this error: mount_hfs: -o owners/dev/disk3s2: option not supported  Any ideas how to fix this?  <comment247286> What disk/partition format? <comment247378> It is hfs. There are two partitions on the USB stick. The other is msdos. <comment247389> Would you edit your post with the output of the command `mount`? Please identify the partition you want owners enabled.
