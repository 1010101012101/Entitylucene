Transfer file between iPhones using Bluetooh <body> Can I transfer data between two iPhones via Bluetooth?  <answer8980> Yes.   There's an AppStore app called Bluetooth Fileshare ($0.99), but it has very low reviews. Also, check out Bluetooth Photo Share (free) if you're only interested in transferring photos.  If you have a jailbroken iPhone, you can use iBlueNova ($5.99), but there might be better/free ways to do file transfer if you're already jailbroken.  <answer9026> If you jsut want to transfer images/contact details etc Bump is a good app, it also works cross platform too.  <answer232083> Why not use AirDrop? You can transfer a lot of information pretty fast and don't require any new software to be loaded?  <comment9550> Only if you have previously installed 1 app in each iPhone. And non-jailbroken options will only allow them to work with same app on the other side.
