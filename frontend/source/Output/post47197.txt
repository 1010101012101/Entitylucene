However, the developers site also says you can either download an older version for free, or build the latest source yourself:     Buy the latest approved release from the Mac App Store℠, go to the   Downloads section to get old 0.31 binaries, or access the source at   the git repository to compile on your own the latest and greatest   version.       Pomodoro is open source: you can donate a small amount of money if you   really liked it and don't want to buy it from Mac App Store℠.   <answer199558> Activity Timer works well. It's free (as in free beer) in the App Store and it integrates well in the task bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VHsLH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment54074> there is also wunderlist which is made with appcelerator Titanium. It GLITCHED a lot and it's not pomodoro. <comment309372> It doesn't look like it's downloadable from the website anymore; everything seems to redirect to the blog.
