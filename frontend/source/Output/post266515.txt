Mavericks and prohibitory sign <body> A main drive was acting up (I hypothesize a broken head, as there is a lag between keyboard input and action; on the clone, no such lag).  So the main needs replacing.  I have a CCC clone, which however is acting up.  Keep in mind that Drive Genius 3 finds NO issues with the drive.  Every so often, the system decides to disappear: windows server is dead, one can quit out of browser applications, but not open anything more.  Hard re-boot is required.  Things start up anew OK more often than not... only to experience the system going AWOL after a while.  The frequency of this episode seems to increase.  Upon re-boot, twice the Prohibitory Sign shows up.  A total novelty to me.  It means that the computer has not found the startup file "boot.efi". First time I rebooted form the original disk, re-cloned, etc.  Second time I tried re-starting and ... the system re-started (posting this from said re-start).  This inconsistent behaviour is worrisome.  Again, Drive Genius 3 finds no flaws; it feels like an OS issue.  What could be going wrong/needs to be checked?  10.9.5 MacBookPro8,2 16GB 1333, no Windows server  <comment334150> Type of hardware?  Windows Server?  Mavericks?  Your question is a bit hard to follow.  Have you tried booting into Safe and/or Verbose mode?  Have you tried booting into recovery?  I doubt it's a h/w issue, but rather just a corrupted OS. <comment334152> I have not tried to boot into Safe and/or Verbose mode, nor recovery mode.  Never needed to in 25 years experience... Given our shared suspicion of a corrupt OS, what should I be looking for? <comment334153> You should be looking for what happens when you attempt to boot into Safe and/or Verbose mode.  You should also see if it boots from Recovery because that will be a pristine boot image.
