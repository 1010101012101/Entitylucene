Copy settings and preferences to new mac <body> I have a Mac at the office and will be buying a new one for home. Is there a way to move my preferences and settings from the old computer to the new one?  <answer132065> Yes, you can use the Migration Assistant software that's included in all recent versions of OS X. See here for Apple's instructions on using it in Mavericks. You'll need to be able to connect your old Mac to your new one, over a local area network (either wired or wireless) or using a Thunderbolt or Firewire cable  <answer132066> Simply copy the contents of your ~/Library from your old user account to your new user account on your new machine.  <comment155252> Would there be any permissions issues with doing it this way? <comment155293> @dwightk There shouldn't be, but as with everything you should always do an ACL reset after it. <comment155331> If I copy the library over and then install an application, will it write a new preferences file over my old one, or work off the old one? <comment155333> @aszekely It'll use the old one
