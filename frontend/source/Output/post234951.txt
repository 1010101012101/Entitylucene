`ls -G` output format changes with less column spacing <body> I want to see coloured output of the codels/code command and so I added   precodeexport CLICOLOR=1 /code/pre  to code.bashrc/code file but now the spacing between columns in the output of the codels/code command changes. How do I maintain the same spacing between columns as the codels/code command without code-G/code option?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3dvHJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment287319> You're right...I was multi-tasking and didn't read it through.  What if you tried ls -WG for the non-printable characters. <comment287320> I just removed my aliases and tried `ls` and `ls -G` my columns line up perfectly.   Do you have anything else in your `.bash_profile` (or anywhere else) that will modify the behavior of `ls`? <comment287326> @Allan I checked `.bashrc, bash_profile, .profile` and there's nothing which could possibly alter the behaviour of `ls` command.
