Number of recent items not working <body> Applications like for example codeTextEdit/code show multiple entries in the codeOpen Recent/code list despite that the number of recent items is set to codenone/code in the system preferences.  Is there another way to adjust the number of recent items? Or to automatically clear the lists of all applications on logout?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4dUIh.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MMrar.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer159207> The number of codeRecent Items/code in TextEdit or other applications is independent from the general settings in the codeSystem Preferences/code. The amount of entries and the entries itself are stored in *.LSSharedFileList.plist files.  Example:    strongPlistEdit Pro method/strongbr To change the number for TextEdit clear the menu in TextEdit, quit TextEdit, open com.apple.TextEdit.LSSharedFileList.plist in ~/Library/Preferences/ with an appropriate application (e.g. PlistEdit Pro (free 14-day trial)) and enter 0 as MaxAmount.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YTIss.jpg" alt="com.apple.TextEdit.LSSharedFileList.plist"  You may have to create (if the file doesn't exist) and modify com.apple.TextEdit.plist afterwards:    precodetouch ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist   /code/pre  to create the file codecom.apple.TextEdit.plist/code  precodedefaults write com.apple.TextEdit NSRecentDocumentsLimit 0   /code/pre  to change the preferences.  strongplutil and nano method/strong   Quit TextEdit and open Terminal.app and enter:    precodetouch ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist   /code/pre  to create the file codecom.apple.TextEdit.plist/code if it doesn't exist  precodedefaults write com.apple.TextEdit NSRecentDocumentsLimit 0   /code/pre  to change the preferences  precodeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.LSSharedFileList.plist   /code/pre  to convert the file to XML.    Open the file with nano    precodenano ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.LSSharedFileList.plist /code/pre  and edit the value of codeMaxAmount/code, write out your edit to file with kbdctrl/kbdkbdO/kbd and exit nano  kbdctrl/kbdkbdX/kbdbr and finally     precodeplutil -convert binary1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.LSSharedFileList.plist   /code/pre  to convert it back to the original binary format.  strongdefaults method/strong works with 10.7, 10.8 and obviously 10.9:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.TextEdit.LSSharedFileList RecentDocuments touch ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist (if the file doesn't exist) defaults write com.apple.TextEdit NSRecentDocumentsLimit 0 defaults write com.apple.TextEdit.LSSharedFileList RecentDocuments -dict-add MaxAmount 0 killall Dock /code/pre  <comment187155> Thanks a lot! Especially your third solution works for me. <comment187157> @samcarter In Mavericks the last version didn't work for me at all. The file reverted to it's defaults (MaxAmount 10) most of the time. Maybe too much testing ;-) <comment187164> strange, I experienced this the other way round. First I tried to edit the .plist with XCode (similar to your first solution) but this did not work. Every time I opened TextEdit the MaxAmount was set back to 10. But your command line approach worked on the first try. <comment187166> @samcarter i didn't have a com.apple.TextEdit.plist file in my prefs folder at the beginning. Maybe that's the reason for the strange behavior
