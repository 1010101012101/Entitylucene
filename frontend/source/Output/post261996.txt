Is it possible to disable microphone feedback to a 7th generation iPod nano? <body> I have a 7th gen iPod nano with a slightly melted audio port. This has lead to a poor connection between the iPod and headphones with a TRRS jack. This poor connection causes the iPod to receive false signals from the headphones (via the microphone connection) and it starts skipping songs with a woman's voice calling out the names of the songs each time. This is very annoying and makes the iPod pretty much unusable. I can stop this from happening by shorting out the microphone with silver paste, but this is a temporary solution as the paste flakes off with each use. Is there any way to permanently disable the microphone feedback into the iPod? Can I hack the firmware of the iPod somehow and remove this feature?
