Automator: How to copy the contents of local folder to a linux smb share? <body> I use Lion and I'm trying to make a folder action that copies the content of a local folder to a strongSamba/strong share, but when I execute the action at strongAutomator/strong it copies the folder and not only its contents to the remote location.  I created a new strongFolder Action/strong and used the strongCopy Finder Items/strong with the strongReplace Existing Files/strong checked. What did I do wrong?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NqTfl.png" alt="Folder Action 1" I also have another version with strongGet Specified Server/strong and strongConnect To Server/strong actions before the strongCopy Finder Items/strong to connect the server when it is note mounted. At least I think this is correct. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iIxSK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment61725> Can you please add a screenshot of the Automator action you use for copying? <comment61726> Well, I can do that but my system is in Brazilian Portuguese. Wouldn't it be a problem?
