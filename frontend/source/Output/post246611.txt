Can I report stolen iPhone if I just logged out of iCloud on that phone? <body> I used to have a phone. It used to be password protected and locked.  However, I wanted to jailbreak that iphone and the iphone is safely at my house anyway.  One day a female friend saw that iPhone and ask if I am using it.  I said no. I want to jail break.  She said his friend can jail break. So I let her have it.  The next day she reports her wallet is stolen and the iPhone is there. I don't trust her.  I go to find myiphone and no device is listed  I forget if I logged out of icloud or not on that iPhone. However, find my iphone says that it cannot locate any of my phone but one device is online. I have no idea where is the online device and which one.  Another list none of my iPhone  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hlY81.png" alt="enter image description here"  I put them all on lost mode. Not sure if things go wrong.  <answer248099> If you just logged out of iCloud on your iPhone, Find My iPhone was most likely also turned off, so it won't be of any help to you. However, if you emdidn't/em logout of iCloud, and the device is just offline, anything you set in Find My iPhone will be applied the next time your phone connects to a network.  Meanwhile, Apple suggests to:     Report your lost or stolen device to local law enforcement. Law enforcement might request the serial number of your device. Find your device serial number.      Report your lost or stolen device to your wireless carrier. Your carrier can disable the account, preventing phone calls, texts, and data use.   Good luck.  <comment306381> I got the phone back. <comment306443> @JimThio nice!
