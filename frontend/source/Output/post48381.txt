Is there an app such as GoodReads for movies? <body> I like the app GoodReads, and I'm looking for something similar for movies. Is there any app you can suggest me?  It should be able to make a collection of the movies I saw/own and to share lists, items,... on social networks (Facebook, Twitter,...)  <answer48387> There are several options you can use here. They can do practically the same:  h3Flikster:/h3  It's an app which will allow you to create watchlist and share them with your friends. And you can even write reviews for movies and share them with your friends.  h3IMDB:/h3  My personal favorite since it has the biggest library and community. You can watch trailers, share items, see actors, make cross-references, share movies with your friends and make watchlists. I personally enjoy using this app!  strongAnd something out of category/strong:  h3GetGlue:/h3  Here you can check into movies/books/shows/music/... you saw/read/watched/listened. And you can emfollow/em your friends and by so, see what they've been up to. It's not really what you want, but it's the closest I could find!  <answer54463> SeenTh.at is in private BETA now. I helped create the site over the past year and we'll be launching to the public later in the year.  You can read more at http://seenth.at/blog.  <answer82548> Yes, there is, Rinema.com        Check out: Rinema Features  Feature Details  emMovies:/em Add, Rate, Review, tag, link...  These little buttons, pretty much everywhere on the site, should come in handy to rate, review or mark a movie as "watched" or "to watch". And, while you review the movies you can also tag them (using the good old #tags) and link them to other movies by taggin them as done in the review below. Review  To tag a movie, write the movie name in square brackets. So, [[The Shawshank Redemption]] will show as The Shawshank Redemption  emDiscuss.../em  Apart from using these little buttons to vote up/down and adding comments. You can also post updates through the homepage. And, you can tag movies, add #tags or tag your friends in them.  Oh! and you can see all conversations about a movie on the conversations tab on every movie page  emLists.../em  Hop over to the lists page &amp; check out some of the lists that others have created. Or better yet, create you own. It's easy peasy.  emSearch.../em  Use the search box on the top nav to search for any movie (by name), Celebrity or user.  If you are looking for a particular movie, but are unsure of the title or wish to search by cast/crew names or just want more options, hop over to the advanced search page (second last option in the dropdown menu)  emDiscover.../em  The Movies link in top nav will take you to our movie suggestions page where we show you some movies that you might want to check out. You can also refine suggestions by a particular genre and/or language.  The best suggestions though are always from people whose tastes you share. So, use the cinephiles link on the top nav to find interesting people to follow. Or invite your friends.  You can also toggle your updates feed on home page to show updates from all users or reviews(from all users). And, use that to find interesting people &amp; movies.  emCollections.../em  You can add movies to various collections via this dropdown accessible from mymovies, individual and review modals.  we've have given three: Must Watch, Favourites, Guilty Pleasure to get you started with but, you can add as many new ones as you want. Just type the new name in the textbox and press Add. You can also delete collections using the [edit collections] link given in the collections list on the my movies page (towards the top).  <answer82550> Funnily enough it is called strongGoodfilms/strong - A social film review site, focusing on what your friends are watching, and what they thought of it:  http://goodfil.ms/  (As I have never used the site personally, I cannot comment further.

I can't add my friends and see their movies on both apps <comment55438> Ah, that's what you mean by social media... I thought different. No, you can't add friends to neither of these apps... <comment55439> What did u think I meant for social network ? So there are no similar apps to goodreads ? <comment55440> IMDB is great, I'm using it, but I would like to see my friends movies sometimes.. <comment55442> By social media I thought you meant sharing on them. Share you watchlist, share your favorite movies,... If you want to see your friends movies, see my updated answer! <comment55446> ok thanks, I guess there is room for a huge hit. Someone will soon publish such app and it will be quite popular <comment62365> Nice, but what about the app ? <comment146286> Still in private beta? <comment173683> yeah i have the same question as yours. I am a big movie fan.I can watch any movie,any time,any place.And i want something like what goodreads give us the chance to let our friends know what we are reading,want to read or have read.IMDb is a great place for movie lovers.But yet again the point is we want to share it with our friends too. stuff like that :)
