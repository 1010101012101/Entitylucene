Does homebrew usually put lots of files in the /usr/local folder itself? <body> Doing codels -ltra /usr/local/code gives a lot of homebrew files and folders in /usr/local itself, as opposed to a subfolder:  precode$ ls -ltra /usr/local/ total 56 drwxr-xr-x@  12 root    wheel    408 13 Jul  2015 .. drwxr-xr-x    7 65535   65535    238 24 Jul  2015 heroku drwxr-xr-x    6 agrimm  admin    204 24 Jul  2015 foreman -rw-r--r--    1 agrimm  admin    291  7 Oct  2015 .yardopts -rw-r--r--    1 agrimm  admin   1241 15 Jan 16:19 LICENSE.txt drwx------    8 agrimm  admin    272 15 Jan 16:25 var drwxr-xr-x    8 agrimm  admin    272 15 Jan 16:31 etc -rw-r--r--@   1 agrimm  admin   3161  4 Apr 14:48 CODEOFCONDUCT.md -rw-r--r--    1 agrimm  admin    861 12 May 09:16 .travis.yml drwxr-xr-x   34 agrimm  admin   1156 12 May 09:17 share drwxr-xr-x  303 agrimm  admin  10302 23 Jun 09:21 lib drwxr-xr-x   98 agrimm  admin   3332 23 Jun 09:22 include -rw-r--r--@   1 agrimm  admin   4266 23 Jun 09:51 README.md -rw-r--r--    1 agrimm  admin   1031 23 Jun 09:51 .gitignore drwxr-xr-x    5 agrimm  admin    170 23 Jun 09:51 .github drwxrwxr-x   21 root    admin    714 23 Jun 09:51 . drwxr-xr-x   12 agrimm  admin    408 23 Jun 09:56 Library drwxr-xr-x  256 agrimm  admin   8704  6 Jul 11:50 bin drwxr-xr-x   60 agrimm  admin   2040  6 Jul 11:50 opt drwxr-xr-x   60 agrimm  admin   2040  6 Jul 11:50 Cellar drwxr-xr-x   15 agrimm  admin    510 13 Jul 10:50 .git /code/pre  CODEOFCONDUCT.md, LICENSE.txt, README.md, .git, .gitignore, Library, bin, opt, Cellar and probably other files and folders refer to homebrew.  Is this normal for homebrew when I chose "Install" for Xcode, and then installed homebrew as per the following?  precode$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/... /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1  Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/mkdir /usr/local  WARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss or the deletion of important system files.

That's how homebrew does.  You can usually trust   precodebrew doctor /code/pre  to tell if things are correct - it is pretty good about flagging anything amiss in code/usr/local/code.   But to confirm your main question, the normal for homebrew it that it's noted for being "chatty" in that directory with many files and folders.   <answer246663> Yes, homebrew adds some files and folders to code/usr/local/code. You can see the full list in the root of the github repository https://github.com/homebrew/brew:  precode.github Library bin etc/bash_completion.d share .gitignore .travis.yml .yardopts CODEOFCONDUCT.md LICENSE.txt README.md /code/pre  <comment303095> Looks normal.  Can have clashes with non-homebrew software.  That's why some prefer homebrew install elsewhere. <comment303491> Also, you can save your `brew list` and blow away the installation, purge `/usr/local` and then watch what gets installed going forward... <comment304339> very nice list and explanation - less hand waving than my answer, too!
