Why can't I see my latest photos when I try to add a picture to facebook? <body> I just imported a bunch of photos from my iphone 6 to my mac book and I have migrated to the new Photos app.  When I go into the Photos app, I do see these pictures that have been imported but when I go to another app (like facebook) and try to add a photo to a post, I go into strongMedia = Photos/strong and none of the newly uploaded photos are showing up.   I am not sure if this is related to migrating from strongIPhoto/strong to strongPhotos/strong on the mac but any suggestion or explanations on what could be going wrong here?  <answer183489> After rebooting, the pictures showed up
