How do I force homebrew to update installed software? <body> I have pianobar installed and I'm trying to update it using codebrew update pianobar/code. I also tried codebrew update pianobar --force/code but that didn't have any effect. It says that I have local changes, but I'm not sure how to tell it to just overwrite these.  precodeFrom http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew  * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:     Library/Formula/android-ndk.rb     Library/Formula/android-sdk.rb     Library/Formula/center-im.rb     Library/Formula/putty.rb     Library/Formula/python.rb     ...

If the problem comes from your dirty git tree and you just want to forget about your modifications, type codegit reset --hard HEAD/code before upgrading.  <answer25800> I don't know why this happens with Homebrew when you don't do anything to mess with it, but here's how I fixed it:  ol liChange to your Homebrew cellar directory codecd `brew --cellar`/code/li liReset git repository codegit reset --hard HEAD/code/li liUpgrade pianobar, at last! codebrew upgrade pianobar/code/li /ol  FYI, codebrew update/code will update Homebrew to the latest version, so you may want to do that before step 3.  <answer273306> This is a general answer, not specific to your codepianobar/code problem.  To update installed software, first update brew: codebrew update/code  and then upgrade the installed software: codebrew upgrade/code  To prevent some software from being upgraded, do codebrew pin YOUR-PACKAGE-HERE/code  <comment29284> I think you have to use `upgrade`. `update` is for updating the formulas. <comment29285> nothing happens when i try that... `brew upgrade pianobar -v` gives  Kernel.exit <comment29293> did 1-3 and it worked as expected, thanks! but then when i try and run pianobar it says `Login... Error: Protocol incompatible. Please upgrade libpiano.` - any thoughts? also when i tried `brew update` i get error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge: Library/Formula/tth.rb. Error: Failed while executing git pull http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew.git master - sorry i am new to homebrew and am really not sure what I'm doing. <comment29295> what do you get when you run `type -a brew`? <comment29297> Ah, git, you make life so fun!. Do `cd \`brew --prefix\`` then `git clean -f` then try `brew update`. As for the Pianobar issue, I'd try `brew upgrade libpiano` next, but I'm not using it, so I'm not certain. <comment29298> brew is /usr/local/bin/brew <comment29299> that worked, thanks so much for all the help! apparently the version of libpiano that is out is not yet new enough though since I'm still getting the error even though it says everything is up to date. <comment29302> Glad to help. I just installed pianobar and it works for me. I know Pandora has updated their protocol recently, but it seems Homebrew's Pianobar version is up to date. Mine is `2011.09.22`, what's yours? It should show on the first line after you run pianobar.
