Is it safe to eject my timemachine backup whilst its decrypting? <body> I encrypted my Time Machine backup (A Western Digital 2tb external drive) then realised that Airport wont mount the backup over wifi, so am currently decrypting the drive (via Disk Utility).  I found the command:  precodediskutil cs list /code/pre  which shows me the progress of the operation (it took a while to register at the under the the menu-bar icon).  Here's a snippet from the output:  precode    Sequence:               13     Encryption Status:      Unlocked     Encryption Type:        None     Encryption Context:     Present     Conversion Status:      Converting     Has Encrypted Extents:  Yes     Conversion Direction:   backward /code/pre  Encrypting the backup took about 24 hours, and the time machine icon currently shows 'Decryptig Backup Disk (28%)'.  My question is: can I eject the drive without losing the backup?  Will the decryption continue when I mount the drive again?  TIA, Tim  <answer62453> I had to leave, so took a punt and ejected my drive. Timemachine took up where it left off when I remounted the drive, no problems!  <answer123456> I would say no - I ejected a decrypting drive (it was decrypting due to me not ticking "encrypt" when adding it back to the computer and it then starting to decrypt) and on reconnection it a/ does not appear and b/ in Time Machines Preferences reports 0 bytes.  In disk utility the drive is detected, the logical volume is greyed out and will not mount.  <comment144156> I should add a warning to this answer: I had additional backups, and your mileage may vary - exercise extreme caution! At a guess, this answer was probably relevant to OSX10.7 - no telling what might change with time! <comment144157> It does sound risky, hence my original question! Curious to know: if you run `diskutil cs list` - is there any output? maybe the disk is still decrypting for you?
