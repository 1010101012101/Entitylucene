Mathematica causing red boxes on screen <body> I'm using a MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar running macOS 10.12.5. I'm experiencing graphics glitches in the form of red boxes especially when dragging things (files or app icons) around the dock or in toolbars (e.g. Safari). This happens emexclusively/em when Mathematica is running. Below is a screenshot of what it looks like.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iOPTp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is anyone else experiencing this issue? Any ideas how to fix it?
