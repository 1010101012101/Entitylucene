can we share music/apps in one house, under different IDs? <body> Me: iPhone + iPad + iMac +Macbook Girl1: iPhone + ipad Girl2: iPhone + ipad Girl3: iPhone + ipad  the girls have a PC in their toyroom that they currently use but then don't often sync there as it's a bit confusing for them to understand.  They are all under 13 so having an ID of their own is not allowed by Apple.  Currently we use my ID to purchase music and apps and just share across our devices, but we may run into problems in the future as I alone own all the purchases. Once they get their own IDs they'll have nothing? I could set up a second KidAppleID so they can use their own gift cards, although they'll have to share which may cause issues, but at least they can share music and apps.    Does anyone have any experience with setting up a family that works? A quick google reveals a lot of frustrated parents and a lot of misinformation.   In order for the girls to use Facetime and iMessage on their ipads they have to have an AppleID, but they are under 13. So I'm going to have to lie?? All I see her are people advising parents to set up kids with their own appleIDs, yet no one is acknowledging the fact that Apple doesn't allow for this.  <comment103536> This is very similar to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/75429/do-i-need-to-set-up-individual-apple-ids-for-all-my-kids-ipads. Can you add some details about why the answers there don't answer your question as well? <comment103538> that particular thread is about sharing apps, and is answered with the same advice: give them an AppleID. It seems few have actually done this or they'd know you can't do it. <comment103542> Of course you can. Nobody forces you to enter the correct age/birthday for your kids. <comment103665> sure, but they force us to lie, don't they.
