Is there a way I can set the Tab key as (part of) an application keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard shortcuts? <body> Basically, I would like kbd⇥/kbd and kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⇥/kbd to "Shift Right" and "Shift Right" (Menu items to indent or unindent selection) in TextMate.  However, I can't set them using the System Preferences GUI, as pressing kbd⇥/kbd tabs to the next UI button.  Is there a way I can do that, maybe using a TextMate-specific custom codeKeyBindings.dict/code?  <answer36726> Well you might run into a stone wall there because by default the system protects and limits the functions of tab so as to ensure proper system response... System Preferences  Keyboard allows one to turn tab to be used for all dialogs in a window, etc.   That being said, are you able to (in the same Keyboard preference window) add in a custom action. Under 10.7, you should have in the right window "Application Shortcuts" from there you can press "+" and select TextMate and then select the menu action you would like to perform. Then simply enter they key strokes.  <answer38109> Custom application keyboard shortcuts are stored in the program's property list file in code~/Libary/Preferences/code, e.g. codecom.macromates.textmate.plist/code.  You can assign a keyboard shortcut (e.g. by adding codeCtrl/code to both) using emSystem Preferences/em and then edit the file to get the correct keyboard shortcut (by removing code^/code from the shortcut, which is codeCtrl/code).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qtSqZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. Pressing the key combination does not trigger the menu item it's assigned to, for both codeTab/code and codeShift-Tab/code. The previously assign codeCtrl-Tab/code and codeCtrl-Shift-Tab/code work without problems.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AqLfq.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  So, in this case, I'm afraid it's just not possible.  <answer38226> You could codecp /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict ~/Libary/Application\ Support/TextMate//code and add:  precode"\t" = shiftRight:; "$\t" = shiftLeft:; /code/pre  That would prevent expanding snippets with tab though.  <comment41779> Yes, this is what I am doing. <comment43160> @gentmatt Please make sure your formatting edits don't break the answer. Thanks. <comment43162> I'm just trying to keep the formatting consistent here on AskDifferent. It's not nice if everybody uses different formatting in his/her post. <comment43164> @gentmatt I noticed. I only commented on it since you got this one wrong. <comment43166> How? Do you mean the little empty space between the lines or something else? Just curious :) <comment43171> @gentmatt `^` is a character (in this context), not a key. Everything else was fine as far as I could tell. <comment43174> You're right. If it were posted as a key, that edit would have been wrong. I actually wonder why apple still uses `^` instead of a compact version of `ctrl` in the menus. It's not intuitive. That `ctrl = ^` is one of the things one just has to know . Thanks! <comment43175> @gentmatt Feel free to edit again. I simply reverted earlier since I don't care about your (correct) changes. <comment43811> This is what I ended up doing, thanks!
