App will not open and will crash on every attempt <body> Whenever I open an app it goes there for a second then crashes and goes directly to the home screen. This haven't happened before, it recently started.br I have restarted my phone, powered it off, and updated to the latest iOS.br Is there anything I can do to fix this other than reinstalling the application?  <answer233474> No, the app is either corrupted (which happens sometimes during the download) or as a serious defect that causes it to crash (and that Apple didn't catch during review).  You'll have to uninstall then reinstall the app.
