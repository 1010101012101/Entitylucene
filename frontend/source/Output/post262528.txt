MacBook Pro crash after sleeping for a long time <body> I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016) running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2659). Recently I found out that if I left my machine sleeping for a long amount of time (about 15+ hours), it will cause a kernel panic and restart itself so when I open my computer the next time it will tell me the computer have shutdown unexpectedly. Is this a software bug or my computer have problem?  strongEDIT:/strong  I got this problem today. The shutdown cause is code-128/code. Maybe a hardware failure? Also sometimes instead of a crash, I also have this problem. (I posted that as a separate question since it's not a crash). Here is the crash report.  <answer275200> Occasional kernel panics are more nanannoyance than something to be fixed.   ul liHow serious are occasional kernel panics?/li /ul  However, if you can make them happen, there is a process to resolve them:  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200553/li /ul  <comment328893> Did you have any thing running before you put your computer to sleep that could have gone horrifically  wrong? <comment328932> @OzzieSpin Nope, nothing is running, just Finder <comment330632> Same thing happens to me, but with much shorter sleep times. Any luck? <comment330706> I'm running into a similar issue with my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014). If I clamshell, if I walk away for 1 minute, if the screensaver is invoked, and sometimes when I use Lock Screen, my computer screen will go black and shutdown. Logs are inconclusive, with not much information. The only thing that I see repeating over and over is that "com.apple.quicklook" always has a crash behavior right before the shutdown happens. <comment346134> Have a look at this [Question/Answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/212809/shutdown-cause-128/212810#212810)  I would get the hardware checked out. <comment346135> @Allan yep, probably have to hit up at Apple since the memory is soldered on.
