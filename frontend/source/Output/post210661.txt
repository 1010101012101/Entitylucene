See all my photos on my iphone without having the files on there <body> I have an imac at home and it has all of my photos on it. As it stands I also have these photos sitting on my iphone as well. My iphone has limited storage so I wanted to know if there was a way to do the following:  ul liHave all my photos physically stored on my imac/li liHave all these photos backed up to icloud/li liHave all my imac photos viewable in my photos app on my iphone - but without these photos taking up physical storage space on my iphone (as it's only 16gb)./li /ul  Is this possible?! It seems that is what photo stream might be on the iphone but I'm not sure, apple doesn't make it very clear.  If it doesn't work there is always the google phptos app which does exactly what I need but i would rather keep it apple if possible for consistency. Thank you.  <answer210674> Apple's designated cloud photos solution is strongiCloud Photo Library/strong using the strongPhotos/strong app on iOS and OS X. It stores and syncs your photos and videos in iCloud with one or multiple devices. It sounds like this should satisfy your requirements quite well (see the note below on iPhone storage).    strongRequirements/strong:  ul liiOS 8.3 or later on your iPhone/li li10.10.3 (Yosemite ) or later on your Mac/li liSufficient iCloud storage to hold your entire photo library /li /ul  strongThings to Note/strong:  ul liiCloud Photo Library is not the same as Photo Stream. (What Photo Stream does exactly, is indeed not very clear. I would recommend just ignoring it or turning it off completely after you setup iCloud Photo Library.)/li liiCloud Photo Library syncs both ways. Photos you take on your iPhone will also appear on your Mac (and all other devices that use it). Edits to photos are also synced./li liFor each device you can choose whether to download the entire library or whether to strongoptimize the device storage/strong. On the devices where you choose the latter (your iPhone in this case), iCloud Photo Library will still take up emsome/em space. The space is managed internally and optimized for your device. It might keep things like thumbnails, favorite photos, photos you frequently or most recently accessed etc. Other photos are downloaded on demand. But the space used should be significantly less than keeping the entire library on the phone. Depending on how hard your "no space" requirement is, this might be a deal-breaker for you. I suggest you just try it out./li /ul  strongSetup iCloud Photo Library/strong:  (Just to be safe, you might want to backup your photo library before proceeding.)  ol liMake sure you are signed in to the same iCloud account on both your iPhone and Mac./li liOn your iPhone: Go to strongSettings  iCloud  Photos/strong, then turn on iCloud Photo Library./li liIn the same menu choose strongOptimize iPhone Storage/strong. /li liOn your Mac: Open strongPhotos/strong (not iPhoto)./li liOpen the app's preferences (menu strongPhotos  Preferences.../strong) and under the strongiCloud/strong tab select strongiCloud Photo Library/strong./li liIn the same menu choose strongDownload Originals to this Mac/strong. This will keep your entire photo library on that Mac./li /ol  strongImport your photos into Photos/strong:  This step depends on your current setup. If you currently use strongiPhoto/strong on your Mac, the photo library should migrate automatically. In general though, you can just drag and drop all of your photos and videos into strongPhotos/strong on your Mac.   Finally, let iCloud Photo Library upload and sync the library. This might take a while.  <comment254242> Which version of iOS and OS X do you use? <comment254244> Hi @ArthurHammer I use the iOS9 and OS X El Capitan <comment254249> A perfect write up, thank you so much for the time you put into explaining this.
