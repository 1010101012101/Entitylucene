Buying itunes gift card for friend in NL <body> I have a friend's birthday who lives in the Netherlands (I live in the UK). Is there any way I can buy a gift card from the netherlands that will send to them? Googling seems to throw up a lot of sites - not many of which seem trustworthy. Many thanks!  <answer226998> Yes. You can buy them directly from Apple and have it either shipped or emailed to them.
