How do I restore the audio balance to default? <body> On my iPod Touch, I was playing around with the audio balance setting (settings - general - accessibility)  How can I reset the balance setting so that it is precisely at the midpoint (i.e. the default)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P50jo.png" alt="iPod Touch settings screenshot"  <answer29900> It should automatically snap to midpoint if you manually move it there.  <comment34320> Looks similar to mine so I think you hit the middle well enough
