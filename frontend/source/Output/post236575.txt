Photos & Optimise Mac Storage <body> I always kept all the photos on my laptop. Now my space is getting low and I decided to switch to "Optimise Mac Storage"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Um0Fu.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I emtrigger/em the optimisation?  The disk is full  precodeFilesystem   Size   Used  Avail Capacity   iused  ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1  699Gi  695Gi  2.9Gi   100% 182360388 765264  100%   / /code/pre  but the size of the Photos library is not changing. Opening and closing Photos does not seem to change anything. Keeping Photos open for a long time does also not bring any effect.  <comment289558> Have you tried restarting your computer? Most likely the process simply hasn't checked, and restarting photos wouldn't change that because photos has background processes that handle some things. <comment289560> @EzekielElin Yes nothing happens after a reboot
