Which graphics chip on MacBook Pro? <body> My MacBook Pro has two graphics chips and automatically switches between them. How can I tell which one is currently in use? I'm just curious really; it's plenty fast enough whatever it's doing by default!  <answer10481> gfxCardStatus is a free app that lives in your menu bar. When you click it, it tells you which graphics card you're using. It also has a beta feature that lets you manually switch to one or the other.  Hope it serves you well.  <answer54142> You don't need to use separate software to check which graphics are being used.  Such information is provided by the strongSystem Profiler/strong of OS X which you can access in two ways:  ol liMenubar &#x2192; Apple &#x2192; kbd&#x2325;/kbd-click System Information) &#x2192; Graphics/Displays/li liTerminal:  precodesystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType /code/pre/li /ol  strongOnly one GPU has the extra section "Displays, Color LCD". This GPU is the one that is currently in use./strong  e.g. In the first picture discrete graphics (ATI Radeon HD) are being used. In the second, integrated graphics (Intel HD 3000) are being used.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IrHeP.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QnOUM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment10996> That's excellent, thank you. Didn't come up in a Google search, which is odd...
