Deleting multiple songs from new itunes playlist <body> How do I remove multiple songs at once in a new iTunes playlist? I know how to remove songs one at a time, but is there a way to remove multiple songs at once?  <answer136338> Select the songs that you want to delete by holding kbdCommand/kbd, then either right click and select delete selection, or press kbdcommand/kbd+kbddelete/kbd.  <comment161716> Pressing command+delete will *delete* selected songs from your iTunes library. If you only want to remove the songs from the playlist you can just press delete.
