Can my Thunderbolt Macbook Air drive my Mini DisplayPort iMac as an external display? <body> I've run an iMac as an external display for a Mac laptop before, but am wondering if my new setup can work like that. I have:  ul li2011 Macbook Air with Thunderbolt/li li2009 iMac with Mini DisplayPort/li limini DisplayPort cable/li /ul  Can I drive my iMac from my laptop? I've had no success so far, despite manually putting my iMac in Target Display Mode using cmd-F2. I can get the setup to the point where both screens turn blue (as expected) but then my iMac reverts to showing the iMac's desktop, not that of the laptop.  <answer40252> According to this source, this should work. This other source confirms it. These are the troubleshooting steps I would try:  ul liRun all strongsoftware updates/strong on both the iMac and MacBook Air. A lot of times there are firmware updates that address issues like this./li liOpen System Preferences  Displays and click strongDetect Displays/strong./li liReset the strongPRAM/strong on both the iMac and the MacBook Air by restarting the computer and holding kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd on boot but until you hear the POST chime twice. Then you can let go and boot normally. Be sure to do this on both machines./li /ul  Try going through these steps and let me know if you're able to resolve the issue.   <answer40283> strikeYep, this should work no problems at all. Here is the relevant support article from Apple on the steps to take./strike  Actually, no. It looks like Macs with Thunderbolt will only use Target Display Mode with other Thunderbolt equipped Macs. This is according to Macworld and also TUAW  Hope this helps.  <comment45359> What size display is your iMac? <comment45512> It's a 27" iMac <comment45552> Are you using a Mini DisplayPort cable or a Thunderbolt cable to make the connection? <comment45553> Thanks, but I read that article before posting here. It mentions nothing about Thunderbolt. <comment45554> mini displayport <comment45572> Flashing the PRAM worked! <comment45611> Great! I've had this issue before when I was at Apple. A lot of display settings are stored in the PRAM and resetting it when you run into issues will usually do the trick.
