Using mosh with Back to my Mac <body> How can I use mosh via iClouds emBack to my Mac/em, like I can do it with ssh?  <answer147412> I got it working.  It requires a bit of messing with mosh, so try it first with the current version before hacking with your installation of mosh. Leave a new answer or a comment if this starts working with the latest versions of mosh please.  First, on both the client and the server, install the latest version of mosh: codebrew install --HEAD mosh/code.   Then edit the codemosh/code file (code$EDITOR 'which mosh'/code (use backticks instead of single ticks)) as specified here: https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/81#issuecomment-57074800  I made the change on both the client and the server.  Then execute codemosh -6 your_server/code if you followed Rnhmjoj's suggestion, or codemosh -6 your_server.you_magic_number.members.btmm.icloud.com/code  <comment173652> Do you mean [this](http://onethingwell.org/post/27835796928/remote-ssh-bact-to-my-mac) way? I have never used it but it seems this can just be done the same way with mosh. <comment173662> That didn't work. Mosh has recently added some ipv6 support, but I wasn't able to get it to work with BTMM.  https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/81 <comment173663> You can install the version of mosh with ipv6 support with `brew install --HEAD mosh` <comment173768> So cool! I just switched to my cell phone tethered internet and it all just reattached and kept working. Mosh FTW! (And of course my ssh session that I also had running said `Write failed: Broken pipe`)
