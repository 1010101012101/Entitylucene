Installing windows on late 2009 iMac 27" <body> I've sucessfully installed Win 7 x64 twice on my imac before. However the 2009 iMacs had faulty HDD, I had it replaced and after that I have trouble installing windows. I know about the display drivers needed to be present during install, I have those but I'm still presented with a black screen with blinking cursor while booting Windows - the Windows logo doesn't show.  Found out in mutiple threads that running these:  precodeBootrec.exe /FixMbr Bootrec.exe /FixBoot Bootrec.exe /RebuildBcd /code/pre  will fix my booting but I'm unable to get into the repair windows section from the Windows installation disc. It tells me that my verions of Windows is not supported with the disc I have. Found out that it's like that and if I disable other HDDs from bios to make it work, but macs don't have BIOS. Is there any other way to execute these commands? Did 5 windows reinstalls already without sucess. I'm pretty desperate.  Any help would be greatly appriciated.  <answer92694> Have you tried the refit boot loader for Macs?  Maybe there is something out of sync with the partition table on your drive (e.g. making new partitions on MacOS that did not sync into Windows or something).  The refit tool has an option to check and sync the HD, and you can choose which partition to boot from ... maybe that fixes something.  <answer92711> This is what helped me. via http://ww3.tbreak.com/forums/topic/65304-boot-camp-repair-win7-partition-which-cant-boot-anymore/     Posting this because it was a huge problem that has basically slowed   down my work schedule by two days...      Here's the scenario: You've created a new Boot Camp partition, or   created a new NTFS partition on your hard disk using a third party app   such as TUXERA NTFS-3G for use with your Boot Camp windows install.   You restart your Mac and... BAM! No Windows anymore!      What happened??      Basically whatever normal operation you did before in creating a new   partition has resulted in the MBR (Master Boot Record, which handles   Windows booting) being corrupted. So how do you fix something related   to PC when you're on a Mac?      Before you start: First, make sure you can boot properly into Mac OS   X. In Mac OS X, in System Preferences, select Startup Disks option.   Choose your Mac OS X drive as the startup drive. You can press the   restart button to test and see that the setting is saved. Second,   uninstall rEFIt if you have it installed as it overrides Single User   mode which is required for this fix. Third, if you have TUXERA NTFS-3G   installed, disable it. Once you have disabled it, unmount and then   remount your Boot Camp partition. This is so that the Boot Camp   partition loads with Apple's native drivers rather than Tuxera's weird   drivers (which are only useful within Mac OS X). Fourth, keep your   Windows 7 install disc handy, you will need it. Don't look at your   easy and convenient Windows 7 install USB flash drive, that won't work   with a Mac.      ul   liShut down your Mac/li   liWhile holding down the "Command" and "S" keys, power on the Mac /li   liKeep holding down these keys till you see a black DOS-like screen with   white text /li   liwait till you get a # mark allowing you to type commands/li   litype in strongfdisk -u /dev/rdisk0/strong and press enter /li   liIf asked to create a new   MBR, press strongy/strong /li   lionce the operation is complete type strongexit/strong /li   liWait till it   boots to Mac OS X /li   liInsert your Windows 7 Installation DVD and restart   your Mac /li   liAfter the Mac booting chime, pres and hold the Option key /li   liYou   should get options to select Mac OSX, another hard disk or the Windows   DVD /li   liSelect the Windows DVD /li   liNow you're in Windows land.

There goes the weekend!   <comment108710> Ran across this: http://ww3.tbreak.com/forums/topic/65304-boot-camp-repair-win7-partition-which-c ant-boot-anymore/  Does anyone know if this is what I should do? Would that let me get into windows repair? I never used terminal commands, ever. Don't want to get into this unless it's what fixes my problem for sure. <comment108723> Thanks for taking time, but that wasn't of much help. Going to answer the question with what helped me. Thanks :) <comment108729> Well it was worth a try :-)
