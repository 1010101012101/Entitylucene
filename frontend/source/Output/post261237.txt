Suppress "There was a problem connecting to server" smb message when VPN is not connected <body> I have set up 5 shared network paths as "Favourites" in the left side panel of my Finder, for quick access to remote shared folders when I'm connected to a VPN. So for example I have in the left side bar:  precode"Share1" (mapped to smb://remoteserver/Share1) "Share2" (mapped to smb://remoteserver/Share2) "Share3" (mapped to smb://remoteserver/Share3) etc /code/pre  This is working well when I have my VPN connected, however I only connect to my VPN when I need access to these paths. The majority of the time I have no need for the VPN. When I restart my Mac, I now get 5 popup error messages saying "There was a problem connecting to server" which I have to close each one before continuing. Is there any way to suppress these messages? Or some sort of workflow to manage this? I'd rather have them silently fail, as I don't care about their connectivity until I connect to the VPN and navigate to them.  Using 10.11.2 (15C50) El Capitan.  Many thanks.
