Stream photos from iTunes to iPad <body> I have enabled strongHome Sharing/strong on a PC (Windows 7). I am successfully streaming strongVideo/strong and strongMusic/strong to my strongiPad/strong.  Now the fun things is that I have found out that I can't strongstream photos/strong from strongPC/strong to strongiPad/strong normally. I have the way for it via strongDropBox/strong but that's not a strongWiFi/strong. It could take sometime for me to normally stream photos.  I can't belive that I can stream strongVideo/strong and strongMusic/strong but I can't stream strongPhotos/strong.  There was a menu item on strongiTunes - Advanced - Choose Photos to Share.../strong  But this seems not what I want (it works great but with strongApple TV/strong, but not with strongiPad/strong)  How is that possible???  Alright, that's possible. But is there a way to stream photos in a such simple and logical way?  P.S: Similiar looking question "http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26250/can-you-stream-photos-from-a-pc-to-an-ipad" is not really similiar.  <answer71323> I don't believe you actually can. Home Sharing does have photo sharing support (as you've discovered with your Apple TV), but I don't believe you can stream photos from a computer to an iPad. Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts and the rest, but I don't remember photos from a computer emto/em an iPad were ever supported.  The only way to do it would be to use a third-party app or use iCloud with emPhoto Stream/em, if you can work within its limitations.  <comment82813> I find this thing ridiculous. Being able to stream video, music, etc. and not being able to stream Photos O_o. Apple way? :D ah...it's sad ;( <comment82814> It does seem a bit bizarre, but if we're being charitable, I suppose it wasn't as big a use case. Streaming _from_ iOS devices or streaming photos to an Apple TV is pretty handy because chances are the TV is the biggest display you have. Whereas your computer is probably bigger-screened than your iPad, so why not view photos on that? Of course, this theory falls down a little when you can stream video but not photos. I guess they want you to use Photo Stream, which isn't too bad. You can get the iCloud Control Panel for Windows (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1455) which is worth a look. <comment82816> Apple TV  Computer  iDevice. Apple considers devices with smaller displays to be ‘lesser’ devices when it comes to streaming. <comment82817> I'd rather use DropBox for that. And iCloud is Computer - Internet - your device and now Computer - your device <comment82818> @duci9y but you can stream videos <comment82827> Oh I’m sorry. You had written “stream” in the title and I automatically assumed that you meant AirPlay but now I see you meant Home Sharing. <comment82873> That works too, though Dropbox for iOS doesn't come with LAN sync unlike the desktop clients so it's still Computer - Internet - Device. <comment82947> I don't know what I was thinking about when typing "and now Computer - your device". I meant that I want to achieve that "Computer - your device"
