Apple TV 2 won't update YouTube app? <body> Recently, Google updated the YouTube App for Apple TV, revamping the whole UI. strikeBecause I love watching ads/strike Because the new version has all content accessible and an improved UI, I would like to upgrade to it.  However, my Apple TV has not automatically updated the channel. I did get the other channels which came out around the same time as this YouTube update.   I've tried rebooting the Apple TV (soft and hard) as well as checking System  General  Software Updates, but no luck.  Is there another way to force an update? Or, is perhaps the update itself limited to Apple TV 3? I would like to know either way before I go through the hassle of a firmware re-install...  <answer167194> The updated YouTube app requires Apple TV Software Update 7.0 which is only available for 3rd generation Apple TV.

Google changed the youtube API and now the ATV2 won't play any youtube videos anymore. Any hints on how to solve this? I am already using PlexConnect to watch Plex content on my ATV2. <comment219157> If you have an iPhone/iPad, you can stream YouTube to your ATV from there. Not as convenient as running it on the ATV directly, but better than nothing
