How can I delete photos imported to an iPhone from a PC? <body> How do I delete photo albums that I accidentally imported to my iPhone 4S from my PC? There is no delete available for either album or individual pictures.  <answer105164> ol liOpen iTunes and select your device by clicking the device button in the top-right.  If no device button is shown, make sure your device is connected (whether by USB or iTunes Wi-Fi Sync)./li liSelect the strongPhotos/strong tab.  There should be a list of sources that you can sync from./li liUncheck the albums that you don't want syncing to your device.  Alternatively, uncheck the strongSync Photos/strong to remove all imported photos from your device./li liClick strongApply/strong (or strongSync/strong) to sync the changes to your device./li /ol  <answer119132> Simply use Syncios, free and VERY easy! Link  <answer121165> If you cannot see a "delete" button next to an album in your iPhone this is because this album was imported from a emdifferent/em iPhoto library than the one on your current computer.  To delete such albums:  ul liConnect the iPhone via USB to your Mac/Pc and start iTunes./li liInside iTunes go to your iPhone, and Photos tab, on the top nag./li liChoose "Sync Photos from iPhoto"./li /ul  This will prompt a warning telling you that pots already synched from emdifferent/em iPhoto libraries will be deleted. This is exactly what you want, so click OK.  ul liLet it start synching, and then cancel the synch. At this point you will be asked whether you want the photos that synched so far left in the phone or removed./li liChose remove./li /ul  You now have wiped out all albums that came from a different computer.  I have managed to delete such albums on my iPhone so this is definitely working.  <comment275299> I don't have "Sync Photos from iPhoto" option in itune !! what should I do ? <comment275300> There is no list or sources! what should I do ? <comment275301> @Suda A screenshot might help explain your problem. Feel free to ask a new question and provide a link to this answer to help provide context. <comment275304> It is very simple: in my itune and after I do step 1 above, when I press the **Photos** tab, nothing is there except this message: `SudaPhone's can access photos in icloud. photos can be downloaded to your device via wifi or cellular network` !!
