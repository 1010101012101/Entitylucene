Why is there a web process active even if Safari isn't opened? <body> I noticed that even when Safari is closed, many web processes are active, and these processes are active even when I just restarted my Mac.    Actually, I noticed that this process is in the Spotlight web content group, what is the purpose of it and when will it stop ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oMcv8.png" alt="enter image description here"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aD7KY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer162349> I noticed that too, and did the following to "solve the problem" (it's not a problem for some people though :P ):  In strongSystem Preferences/strong, open strongSpotlight/strong. In strongSearch Results/strong tab, disable strongBookmarks &amp; History/strong. Then restart. After that, Safari Web Content process won't be active when Safari is not open.  <comment189767> Is it perhaps a Dashboard widget? That looks like a news site, so perhaps a news ticker widget? <comment189769> I don't have any dashboard widget, and many websites are concerned, but never all of them at once. **But as I mentioned, this seems to be linked to Spotlight.** <comment189772> Is this website perhaps in your Reading List within Safari? Perhaps Spotlight is used to index the content of your Safari Reading List. <comment189773> No, I checked and this website isn't in my reading list. <comment234639> But I think we should probably wait till it stops, apart if it never does... <comment238828> Wow. I thought I had disabled all of them (Bing, Suggestions, etc) but I never would have guessed this one. Thank you!
