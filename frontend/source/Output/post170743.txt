How to launch an iOS Simulator with Safari open using a single command? <body> I am looking for a solution to launch the iOS Simulator from command line with Safari launched by default. Launching the simulator from command line is easy. So is the launching of Safari. But I want (rather need) to do this in a single command line statement which will be executed from some third party tool. Is there a possible way to do this?   I have Xcode 6.0 installed with me on OS X version 10.9.4. For now, I am starting the simulator using codexcrun instruments -w "iPhone 6 (8.1 Simulator)"/code  But I am not able to figure out if we can pass extra arguments to this statement so that it launches Safari as well.  <answer170744> You can open a webpage in safari using :   precodexcrun simctl openurl &lt;Device UDID&gt; http://www.google.com /code/pre  You can determine the Device UDID by running xcrun codesimctl list/code  Just run both command using the code&amp;&amp;/code operator.   precodexcrun instruments -w "iPhone 6 (8.1 Simulator)" &amp;&amp; xcrun simctl openurl &lt;Device UDID&gt; http://www.google.com /code/pre  <comment200809> It just launches the simulator and does nothing else. Do I need to replace Safari with something else? <comment200811> I think @VivekVDwivedi meant MobileSafari, not the desktop one... `open -a` opens the desktop applications. <comment200820> Yes, I meant the mobile safari. I am working on automation but unable to find a way till now to launch the mobile safari with simulator in a single command. I have a shell script which does the job, but I am still researching to get this shell script out. <comment200823> possible duplicate of [How to launch browser in iOS Simulator from command line?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/117064/how-to-launch-browser-in-ios-simulator-from-command-line) <comment200824> I have seen that thread already and it is not what I am looking for. I don't want to go to any URL. Just launch the Mobile Safari App. And look at the answer provided for xCode 6.0 which doesn't talks about launching the safari. <comment200825> Please see my update.
