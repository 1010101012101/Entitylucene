listing all processes in iOS 5.0.1 <body> How could one go about viewing all the processes in an ssh session to my (jailbroken)iphone? I'm currently able to ssh in, I have bash installed, core utilities installed, shell-cmds package installed and the system-cmds package installed.  I would have expected the "ps" command to be available from the core-utilities package, but this does not seem to be the case. What am I missing?  <answer42942> I believe the package Cydia package adv-cmds contains a copy of PS  <comment48855> There's also a package that contains top.
