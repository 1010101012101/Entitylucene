Script to be activated if web page changes <body> I'm looking for a way to have a script running on my desktop that will check a certain webpage for changes every codex/code seconds, and if a change is made, it gives me an alert. I understand that with high-end websites, some changes will be made almost constantly, but what I'm looking for monitoring now is a bare-bones HTML page that I'm waiting for a link to show up on. Is there a way to do this?  Edit: Would it be a command to download the html and store it, and then a recurring download-and-check command?  <answer78886> Save this as code~/bin/example/code and run codechmod +x ~/bin/example/code. (Edited to only check the modification date from the header.)  precode#!/bin/bash  url=http://www.iana.org/domains/example tempdir=~/Library/Caches/scripts temp=$tempdir/example mkdir -p $tempdir modified=$(curl -sI "$url" | grep ^Last-Modified) if [[ -f "$temp" &amp;&amp; "$modified" != "$(cat $temp)" ]]; then     terminal-notifier -message 'Example changed' fi printf %s "$modified" &gt; $temp /code/pre  To run it every 15 minutes, add code*/15 * * * * ~/bin/example/code to crontab (codeEDITOR=nano crontab -e/code).  terminal-notifier can be installed with codesudo gem install terminal-notifier/code.  You could also run it every five seconds in a shell window:  precodewhile :; do ~/bin/example; sleep 5; done /code/pre  <comment91150> Would a shell script (running in Terminal) be an option as well? <comment91159> @patrix Yes, it would. <comment91179> In case you want to try yourself, look at `curl` and `diff` (`man curl` and `man diff` in Terminal) and read any Bash shell programming tutorial. <comment91186> If the server publishes an ETag or Last-Modified header, you wouldn't even need to download the whole page but only the headers reducing resource wasting on both sides. <comment91189> Where is "$tmp/example" fetched from the web once to act as a baseline? <comment91197> Sorry to be picky but $temp still needs to be initialized (e.g. by running `curl -sI "$url" | grep ^Last-Modified  "$temp"`) <comment91204> @patrix I forgot that -f check from the first revisions, thanks. <comment91538> So...I don't like using code I don't understand. I'll accept this as the answer, but sometime could someone walk me through how it works in chat? <comment91739> The part where this specifies to parse a multitude of HTML documents and programmatically determine if this constitutes a "change" would be better suited on StackOverflow.com. An edited question on how to automate the download of one URL to a file would seem to be on topic since Automator allows that functionality.
