How can I connect a bluetooth mouse without using the cursor (chicken and egg problem) <body> My bluetooth mouse batteries died, and when I replaced them, the mouse didn't reconnect. Now how can I get OS X to discover and connect my mouse without having a mouse to open the mouse dialogue?  <answer283308> You can open the Mouse System Preferences by using Spotlight search.   ol liPress kbdâŒ˜-Space/kbd to open Spotlight. Type "mouse" to find the Mouse System Preferences and press kbdEnter/kbd./li liWhen the Mouse Preferences are opened, make sure the mouse is on and wait for it to be discovered. The "Connect" button should be blue, so you can press kbdEnter/kbd to connect to it, and you're done./li /ol  <answer283363> You should see a prompt when you turn on you computer. If the mouse can't be found. Check if the mouse is on.  Check all other computers to see if one of them is paired with the mouse. (If that is the case, unpair it) If none of those work. Try a USB mouse. Hope I helped!:)  <answer283707> Keep a cheap usb mouse and keyboard in the back of some closet (with the batteries removed) to quickly use in an emergency.  I've successfully used the keyboard and mouse once each in the last 8 - 10 years but it's worth it.  <comment357207> Spotlight might be disabled though (I mean when all kinds of indexing are turned off) <comment357224> If Spotlight is indexing or disabled: Cmd+Tab to Finder, Cmd+Shift+A to open applications, 'sys' to go to system preferences, Cmd+O to open it, type 'mouse', then hit enter. Should open the mouse preferences pane :) <comment357225> Or, in fewer keystrokes: Ctrl+Shift+(Fn if necessary)+F2, press down arrow until you hit system preferences, enter to open it, then type 'mouse' and hit enter. <comment357227> Welcome to Ask Different.  I don't think the OP was actually looking for other answers because he asked and answered his own question immediately.  I think this is only a way to document an issue the OP had and to provide the answer that worked for him. <comment357229> @fsb True enough, this was a way of publishing the solution to a problem I had, that others also may face. However, other solutions are also welcome. If anyone thinks the answer is useful, they can upvote it, or downvote it if they think it is not useful. <comment357233> @fsb Other answers are always welcomed to self-answered posts. Just because OP posted a solution doesn't mean there isn't an alternative, which may even be superior. <comment357234> @grgarside Yes, I know.  The answer came from a new user whom, I believed from the 'Hope I helped' part, was not familiar with that practice.  I was just letting them know.  I think it's great that the question gets additional answers! <comment357261> Alternative, easier solution: connect wired mouse. Use wired mouse to click buttons to connect wireless mouse. Does require you having a spare wired mouse lying around though. <comment357280> @aglasser how did you ever find that out? <comment357331> Just chained together keyboard shortcuts that I use on a daily basis, since I try to shun the mouse as much as possible. Cmd+Shift+A is helpful on the desktop to quickly open the Applications folder. Ctrl+Shift+F2 is helpful if you ever need the menubar without the mouse. <comment357502> I am a new user to the forum but I have been using Mac OS x since I was a toddler <comment357504> And "the hope I helped" part is just my way of apologizing in advance if my solution does not work for the user. The same problem may be able to be fixed on one computer with a solution that may not work to fix the same problem on another computer of the same type. <comment357728> Works, but not exactly the nicest solution.
