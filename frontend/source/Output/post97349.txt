text diff for mac OS <body> I see someone has already asked a similar questions,   Diff application with posibility to input text manually  but got no answer.  I'm looking for a software that compares diff between 2 text block (add manually),   2 folders (and thier subfolders), 2 text files.  Something like beyond compare for windows.  I'm using Mac.  <comment114174> There is a (valid) answer in the question you are referring to. How does your question differ from that one? <comment114230> In that same vein you could try using crossovermac or wine bottler to install BC. Or try BBEdit for Mac.  I think all of those solutions eventually require coughing up some $$ for a license though.
