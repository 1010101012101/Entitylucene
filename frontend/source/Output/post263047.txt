Safari address bar field looses focus after loading a webpage has finished <body> Say I wanted to google something by writing "cnn" in the address bar field, but accidentally chosen "cnn.net" from the prompt list. I go kbd⌘/kbdkbdL/kbd to input another website, but meantime Safari loaded "cnn.net" and lost it's focus on the address bar field. Now I need to start over with kbd⌘/kbdkbdL/kbd.  Can this behaviour be adjusted?
