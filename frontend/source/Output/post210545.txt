Calculating volume which formula in Numbers? <body> We are tracking the water depth of our cistern and would like to input the volume of water as a function. We have the measurements of the cistern so the only changing variable is the depth. Which formula in Numbers on iPad should we use?   <answer210633> Basic math.  ul li[length]sup3/sup (Length × width × height) /li liFor a cylinder,  * radiussup2/sup * height. /li /ul  When the depth measurement changes, change the corresponding depth amount and strongNumbers/strong will recalculate.  Just be sure to use the same units of measure for all dimensions.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tqxfo.jpg" alt="calculate volume"  <comment254138> Could you show us what you have? We specialize in helping people understand pages and not maths. This seems like an algebra/geometry homework without some more details on what exactly has you stumped. <comment254149> No formula needed, this is just a simple calculation.  Like @bmike said, what is it that has you stumped?  How to create the calculation?  Or how Numbers calculations work?
