Apple IPhone 6 S got wet and screen does not work <body> Phone got wet. Screen does not work. Insurance has replaced the phone but I want to reset the wet phone back to factory setting.   <answer262659> This may be a situation where only a hammer will set it back to defaults. If the screen, EG emthe only way you have of interacting with the phone/em is non-functional then there is literally nothing you can do, save taking it to a repair shop and paying them to fix it. Assuming it is even possible.  If you are worried about your private data still on the phone, take a hammer to it..
