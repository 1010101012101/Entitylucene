How do I disable the drop shadow from text on the Desktop? <body> Does anyone know how to get rid of the text drop shadow from files and folders on the Mac desktop?  I would prefer a subtle shadow with an offset of 1 pixel.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KjBdW.png" alt="pretty"   If you know of a hack to get rid of the drop shadow completely, please share!  <answer33945> I don't think it exists as a setting. You could go around the problem by using a black or dark background.  <answer45468> You can experiment with modifying system font settings using the free utility TinkerTool. Note that with the Fonts panel open in Tinkertool, you can specify font shadow settings.  I don't know what results you might achieve, since the Mac OS prevents you from over-riding certain settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O8Tj9.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can use TinkerTool to reset any settings you change to the system default.  <comment38727> Welcome to Ask Different! Before this was edited, it looked a bit like a rant. In the future, please keep ranting out of your posts and focus on what you want to achieve. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment167002> I'm hopeful for a command line solution or script that would serve to to decrease or drop the shadow (ie not a packaged application download).
