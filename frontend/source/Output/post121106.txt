How can I make a PDF document smaller? <body> Here's my problem, I have a PDF document 583KB, and I want to make it under 500KB so I can upload it. What should I do?  <answer121107> ol liOpen the PDF in Preview./li liGo to File → Save As… (⌥⇧⌘S)/li liSelect strongReduce File Size/strong as the Quartz Filter  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ung97.png" width="400"/li /ol  <answer121460> You might try adding a custom filter.  Reference: http://www.hoboes.com/Mimsy/hacks/quality-reduced-file-size/     The PDF file was nearly 20 megabytes. After saving it with Reduce File   Size, it was down to under one megabyte... but the quality of the   images was so bad that they didn’t serve to illustrate the concepts in   the text.      It was obvious what was happening, and I knew that when saving JPEG   files you are allowed to trade off low file size with increased   quality. But there was no slider available in the Quartz Filter menu   to increase the quality of the image.      The answer, it turns out, is in ColorSync Utility in the Utilities   folder off of the Applications folder. ColorSync Utility can create   new Quartz filters. Open up ColorSync Utility and switch to the   “Filters” pane. This will list all of the filters that you currently   have available.      ul   liIn the lower left, click on the “+” button. This creates a new filter./li   liGive the filter a name, and press return./li   liTo the right of the filter’s name, choose the down arrow. A menu will pop up./li   liFrom the pop-up menu, choose “Add Image Effects Component”, and from that menu choose “Image Compression”./li   liAdjust the image compression Mode to JPEG./li   liAdjust the image compression quality however you prefer./li   liThe next time you use Preview to “Save As...”, you'll have a new option under Quartz filters./li   /ul      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iFQQY.png" alt="Filters"      [...] after you create the filter it doesn’t automatically show up in   Preview’s list of Quartz filters. Either ColorSync or Preview is   working from the wrong folder.      ColorSync saves your filters in your personal “Filters” folder under   your “Library”. But Preview looks in “PDF Services” for the filters.   Copy or move the new filter from your Library’s “Filters” folder to   your Library’s “PDF Services” folder. If you want to make the filter   available to everyone who uses your Mac, put it in the main   “/Library/PDF Services” folder instead. Note that Lion has hidden the   Library folder, so you’ll need to use the “Go” menu and “Go to   folder…” to go to your “Library” folder, and also to go to the   “/Library”, depending on whether you are making it available for   yourself or for everyone.   <answer147623> Actually, the best way is to use this website. Smallpdf, it is far more easier and better than other ways.  <comment141157> How did you create that pdf ? <comment141159> Thank you,Sir. But first, it is **Export** now. Second, the document get bigger after **Reduce File Size**, it is now 2.3MB. <comment141161> @MatthieuRiegler It is my college transcript, I was trying to upload it in Common Application. CA said no PDF bigger than 500KB. <comment141162> @Ave 'Save As' still exists and is still just as correct (open the file menu and hold ⌥). Reduce File Size is [the official Apple way](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH7252) to reduce the size of a PDF. It works by compressing pictures in the PDF. <comment141163> SO maybe it's my problem. The official apple way does not work. <comment141164> @Ave Do you have pictures in your PDF? If it's only text it won't work. <comment141165> It depends on what is in the PDF - some data streams compress incredibly well, others get larger when you try to compress them. What happens when you use finder to compress the file (right click on the icon)? <comment141167> @bmike    From 585kb to 548KB <comment141168> My guess is the PDF is already compressed given that modest reduction. It's not a direct answer, but if I had such PDF and needed to dissect it, I would open it in a tool like PDFPen or Acrobat Pro where you can split the pages, downsample images, edit things. However, that opens a can of worms if you are representing your transcript as something you had a hand in editing the content. You might need to ask CA support for a way to provide the file as a supplemental attachment or your college to send you that has less images/text. <comment141169> Also - related for [reducing PDF questions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=reduce+pdf+size) and [splitting PDF questions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=split+pdf+page) might be worth scanning... <comment145313> `ColorSync saves your filters in your personal “Filters” folder under your “Library”.

If you click View - Columns then you can laterally scroll back and see both your Library and the System Library.
