Repartition and reinstall on 2012 Air + Mavericks <body> I have an old macbook air (2012 edition), with BootCamp set up, with Windows 7 and Mavericks installed.  I want to wipe everything, all the data on both partitions, safely, and reinstall with a different partition size.  What's the best process for this? Reinstall Mavericks, then resize the partition? Resize, then reinstall Mavericks?  I'd appreciate any advice :)  <answer270816> The safest way to wipe your entire drive and do a clean OS install is this:  ol liRemember to back up ALL of your data!/li liOpen Boot Camp Assistant and select the "remove windows" option. Follow the steps to remove windows and resize your drive to only be MacOS./li liAfter this is complete, shut down your computer./li liBoot into recovery mode by holding codeCmd/code + codeR/code at startup./li liOpen Disk Utility in recovery mode. Select the remaining partition (MacOS), then set a name for it in the box provided and wipe it./li liAfter this is complete, close Disk Utility and choose the "Install Mac OS X" option./li liFollow the steps to install Mac OS X on the new partition./li /ol  <comment340414> There's many tutorials and sites around the net with the steps you need to follow to wipe your drive.  What have you already tried and what errors have you encountered? <comment340417> A lot of the tutorials I've found are from many years ago and I'm not sure if something has changed, and I'm worried that I'll end up in a "bricked" state somehow if I do something in the wrong order. <comment340434> There's a potential alternative, quicker & without needing to wipe & start from scratch - [Paragon Hard Disk Manager](https://www.paragon-software.com/home/hdm-mac/). It's not a procedure I've used myself [moving the partition boundaries between bootcamp/OS X], but I've used the app for other restructures, so far without incident. Backups always recommended, of course ;)
