Xcode installation seems corrupt? <body> I've been try to download Xcode for work, but for some reason the Mac App Store is giving me a bit of trouble. Activity monitor shows some network usage, but in Launchpad it seems the download isn't moving.   When I go to the purchases panel of the Mac App Store, I see this.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SIbKN.png" alt="xcode problem"  No status, no pause button, in fact - the button has no text on it! I've tried restarting the App Store, restarting my computer, even removing the codecom.apple.appstore/code folder in code/var/folders/code but alas, no luck.  Can anyone diagnose the issue? When I removed codecom.apple.appstore/code, Xcode still showed up on Launchpad, and clicking on it did nothing - it was frozen in time. So can I kill off this partial download and start new?  <answer52874> I always start by searching for "troubleshoot" in the help menu for the App. You will get this link:  http://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/troubleshooting/  There are several things that could be going on, but I would follow this link - that has the easy steps to try and then an Apple support link where they can perhaps look at the server side or walk you through cleaning folders by hand in terminal if needed.  ul liMac App Store: How to resume interrupted downloads/li /ul  <answer53572> As near as I can tell, this might be a Hidden Purchase. Choose Store  View My Account, where you can see hidden purchases. You may be able to cancel or unhide the download from there.  <answer53612> codesudo find /var/folders/ -ipath '*com.apple.appstore*' -print/code   should show you App Store related cache files.  codesudo find /var/folders/ -ipath '*com.apple.appstore*' -print | xargs sudo fgrep -i xcode/code   should show you any of those files which are related to XCode.  You could run  codesudo find /var/folders/ -ipath '*com.apple.appstore*' -delete/code  which will DELETE all of the files that it finds (not just the xcode ones!) but that shouldn't be a big deal. I would expect the App Store.app would re-create any files it needs if they are not found in /var/folders/.  I ran it it did not seem to cause any problems. As always, make sure you have a complete bootable backup before running any Terminal code suggested by some stranger on the Internet :-)  <comment60812> Im curious, how does the 'other purchases' area show up? As in, whats the difference between that and purchases? <comment60839> @jmlumpkin I have absolutely no idea <comment61290> I have the same sort of problem. What are these "other purchases" and why is the button blank and unclickable? <comment61345> I had the same symptoms and reproduced the same way as @Richard Szaley (but with a different App redeemed from the the developer center)... unfortunately this suggestion did not resolve the issue. <comment61346> We have a winner! This worked to resolve the same issue I had with the Mountain Lion download.
