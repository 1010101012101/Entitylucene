Any.do done list <body> I have iphone 5c and any.do. The done tasks are shown at the bottom of "today" grayed out and taking up space. I can delete them  but it seems very permanent, there's no way to look at them later?! Is there any way to archive them without permanently deleting them?  <answer112573> You can shake the phone to archive all of the done tasks, they are then moved to the archive. You can then access them from codeSettings -&gt; Done Tasks/code
