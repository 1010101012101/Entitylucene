Floor Plan software for Mac <body> Is there a free program that can make floor plans on a Mac? Specifically, I'm looking for something that's fairly easy to use. Doesn't need to have a ton of features, just shouldn't be a headache.   <answer193785> You could try Lucidchart. I think it's pretty close to what you're looking for. Free, not a huge selection of shapes when it comes to floor plans, but very easy to use for making an office desk plan or something like that.   <comment231043> with dimensions , to scale,  ect.... please be more specific.
