Is there a way to dynamically manipulate the spellcheck dictionary? <body> I would like to have a way to dynamically add and remove words from the system-wide dictionary in Mountain Lion. The use-case is:  ol liI'm working on a piece of fiction that has a lot of odd names in it that I would like spell-checked -- hit some key-combination that loads those odd name into the dictionary list of known words/li liI'm done working on the fiction and I no longer want those words polluting my dictionary -- hit some key-combo to unload those words from the dictionary/li /ol  I could be working on two separate pieces of fiction and would want to load and unload each list separately. I'm not looking for an app with a custom spell-checker; I'm definitely looking for something that works with the built-in, system-wide spell checking sub-system.  All solutions considered: open source, paid applications, AppleScript, Automator, shell scripts -- anything and everything.  <answer123480> When you press the Learn button, the word is added to code~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary/code if the language is set to automatic or to code~/Library/Spelling/en/code if the language is set to U.S. English. codeen_GB/code is used for British English and codeen/code is used only for U.S. English.  If you edit the files in code~/Library/Spelling//code directly, you can apply the changes by terminating the codeAppleSpell/code process.  So try to assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodecd ~/Library/Spelling if [[ -e fiction ]]; then   mv en normal; mv fiction en; d=fiction else   mv en fiction; mv normal en; d=normal fi killall AppleSpell terminal-notifier -title "Using dictionary $d" -message '' -group spellingdictionary sleep 3 terminal-notifier -remove spellingdictionary /code/pre  If for example you use the British English dictionary, change codeen/code to codeen_GB/code.  You can install codeterminal-notifier/code with codesudo /usr/bin/gem install terminal-notifier/code.
