Setting a shortcut to "Right Size This Column" in Finder on El Capitan <body> I'm trying to set a keyboard shortcut for "Right Size This Column" in Finder. I've tried setting it under Keyboard  Shortcuts in System Preferences, but this does nothing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3xsu.png" alt=""  <answer240304> There is no menu item in Finder named "Right Size This Column" so this shortcut does nothing as no matching menu item can be found.  <comment295381> Oh, right. Thanks for the help.
