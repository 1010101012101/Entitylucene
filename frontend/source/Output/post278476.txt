Monitors don't show up in Display Arrangement preferences <body> I have two external monitors on my MacBook Pro 2015 15" and I was doing an adjustment on the display arrangement yesterday when suddenly the displays on the arrangement tab gone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXbOX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried already:  ol liRestart the computer/li liUnplug and plug all the cables/li liChange cables/li liReset NVRAM/li liReset SMC/li liClick on detect displays/li liCreate another admin user/li /ol  The strange thing is when I click on Mirror Displays, the displays appear but right after I unmark that they're gone again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oosLa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment350411> Which version of macOS are you running, on which hardware? <comment350412> Last one, 10.12.4 - MacBook Pro 2015 15".  http://imgur.com/a/g3giE http://imgur.com/ynEhEIi <comment350418> Is anything showing up on the displays?  Also, did you try unsetting the "adjustment," whatever that was? <comment350485> @Allan yes, the displays works perfectly, but I can't move windows between them. The adjustment I was doing was simple moving the displays to a better arrangement.
