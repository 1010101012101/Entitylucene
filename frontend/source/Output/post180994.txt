Is there are tool that can store and retrieve monitor arrangements as presets? <body> I'm working with a MacBook at different locations where monitors are then in a different positions relative to the MacBook's screen. As a result I have to rearrange the monitor setup every time I use a different workplace.  Is there a built-in way in OS X or a tool to save an arrangement and easily restore it, preferably from the menu bar?  <answer193732> You should try SwitchResX.  It allows you to create emDisplay Sets/em defining many variables like placement relative to other displays, setting which display is the primary, etc.  Here is the emDisplay Set/em page showing the options.  It even has the ability to set a keyboard shortcut to each emDisplay Set/em so you can quickly switch layouts, resolutions, etc.
