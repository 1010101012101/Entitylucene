Darwin/Linux/Unix command line email client that supports iCloud? <body> I need to access my iCloud email from a command line.  Is there a command line client for Mac OS X (and/or Linux and/or Unix) that can connect to Apple's (I assume it is IMAP) servers?  <answer50734> A popular command line e-mail clients is Mutt. Use a package manager such as Brew or Macports to install it on MacOS. Have a look at this page for some pointers.  You can find the IMAP settings for iCloud in this Support article.  <comment77779> Sorry. Overlooked this answer for a long time. In fact it is exactly the correct answer.
