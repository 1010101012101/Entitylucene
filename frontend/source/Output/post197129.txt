How to restore manually Saved State files of Terminal? <body> My MBR crashes quite often. Normally I've multiple terminal windows and usually they're restored after crash.  However from some to time they're not restored, so for that reason I was doing the backup every hour (in cron, not Time Machine) to backup the whole code~/Library/Saved Application State/code including codecom.apple.Terminal.savedState/code.  However when I've replaced back my savedState folder (1. removing the old one, 2. using different type of terminal) and run Terminal - it simply doesn't work as expected (as it seems it doesn't load the state files).  Is there anything that I'm missing? Do I need to do anything extra so Terminal can recognise its state files or simply backing up more folders to keep my window states safe?  The backup folder consist codedata.data/code (48M), codewindows.plist/code (empty) and codewindow_1.data/code - codewindow_56.data/code files (total 55M).  <answer197139> It seems that the codewindows.plist/code has been corrupted during the backup, as it's empty.  The Terminal restores correctly when doing the following test:  ol liRun Terminal./li liType anything like: codeecho test 1/code./li liKill the terminal explicitly, e.g.: codekillall Terminal/code./li liRun again, it should have the previous message/state./li liRemoving files and restoring from it, it'll have the same state./li /ol  The corrupted code.plist/code file can be manually rewritten by the following hacky steps:  ol liConvert codeplist/code into its XML representation (Terminal will still recognise it):  precodeplutil  -convert xml1 -o windows.plist windows.plist /code/pre/li liEdit the file to match its windows id (codeNSWindowID/code) to the appropriate files. Or create as many new windows manually to have the same files, kill the terminal, replace only the window code.data/code files and re-run again.  However if the data files are not inconsistent with plist file, the Terminal will restore the default session overriding your files./li /ol
