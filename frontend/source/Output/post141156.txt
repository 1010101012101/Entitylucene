Same user multiple times - Sharing & Permissions <body> My account at work (rtonneyck), is a Windows domain account. That's what I use to login too. I noticed the permissions for my Shared windows drive has my user name listed multiple times. Why is this?? Is this a bug with Mavericks?

Unless you're experiencing performance/functionality issues, I recommend contacting the person who administers that share, letting them know about what you found, then ignore it. :)  If you're experiencing performance/functionality issues, find out if anyone else who uses the share experiences the same symptoms, compile your findings, then submit them to the share administrator.  <comment166335> Not sure what you mean.  My own OS X workstation is bound to Active Directory and I use a network account, but I'm not understanding your issue.  Picture or example output? (make sure you hide any sensitive info!) <comment166356> That is a Windows function <comment166364> Added a screenshot. Sorry was on mobile at the time and couldn't add one <comment166506> Thanks for the suggestion. I'll get my IT admin to remove the extras.
