Apple IPhone 5c does not allow incoming or outgoing calls <body> My IPhone doesn't allow incoming or outgoing phone calls. Starts to dial then just goes back to the contacts screen  I can receive messages and send messages BUT only to people with an Apple device. Please help.  <answer277743> A couple of things to try:  ol liTry forcing it off (hold power button and home button down for 10+ seconds) and back on./li liTry removing and reseating the SIM. /li liMake a test call to customer service (611 in the US)./li liIf none of the above work, you can reset network settings (Settings - General - Reset - Reset Network Settings)./li /ol  This is what any tech support (Apple Store, carrier) would have you do first.  <comment349537> Sounds like you need to contact your provider.
