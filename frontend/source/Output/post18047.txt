Can I show the Mission Control desktop number in the menu bar? <body> Spaces used to show the space number in the menu bar; I would glance at it regularly to see which space I was in (1, 2, 3, etc).  How do I get Mission Control to display the current desktop in the menu bar like that?  <answer19227> I could not find any built in feature for this so I decided to use the backgrounds. I found a backgound image that I wanted, and made 8 copies of it. Then I wrote the numbers 1-8 on each of them next to where the dock usually are. Then you press ctrl+1 to make sure your in desktop 1 right click the background and chose the image with 1 written on it. Then close down the system preference box (otherwise you end up changing only desktop one). Then press ctrl+2 and do rightclick again. NOt allowed to post screenshot :( to show how it looks  <answer55079> I found this question because I had the same issue. Turns out, all I really wanted was to instantly know what screen I am on.  I just accidentally "discovered" the obvious: if you 4-finger swipe up, everything zooms out. Across the top, all your desktops are shown and your current desktop is highlighted! (4-finger swipe down to go back to normal).  So this quick &amp; easy approach solves things for me! Besides requiring much less work, it's also better than making custom numbered background images because I often have windows that entirely block my background. Now, I just swipe up, then back down and, in a split second, I know exactly where I am.  Posting here just in case it helps someone else...  <answer61024> This problem now has a much more robust solution, thanks to Total Spaces.  This app brings back the old 2D grid of spaces and shows the space number in the menu bar.  <answer243486> Maybe the open source WhichSpace project can do this:     h1WhichSpace/h1      Have you ever forgotten which space is currently active on OS X (10.11+) and wanted a quick way to tell? Didn't think so... but I did!      h2Screenshot/h2      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZP3tV.png" alt="WhichSpace"   <comment21063> can you upload the screenshot to imgur.com and post a link to it here? <comment21064> Good idea, I upvoted so you might have enough rep for an image upload <comment63199> +1. not a bad idea. I'm going to overlay numbers on the 4 corners of my background. Thanks for posting this... <comment267357> Unfortunately that solution relies on code injection into Dock - which requires the turning off of some security features on El Capitan. It was a good solution in 2012, but not any more. <comment314216> This open source project is by far the best solution I've found, if you want a simple number to ID the current Space. No bloated duplication of features like some other options. <comment324904> To make WhichSpace start automatically when you log in, open System Preferences, Users & Groups, Login Items, and add WhichSpace to the list.
