How can I launch a printer scanner from Spotlight? <body> I can go to the "Printers &amp; Scanners" panel from Spotlight, but I cannot call the scanner directly. Is there any way to make Spotlight index a shortcut to the default printer's Scanner app?  It would save the 2 to 3 clicks it takes to click on the correct printer if needed, click on the "Scan" tab and finally on the "Open Scanner" button.  (It's rather counter-intuitive to have to go to a System Preferences panel to be able to scan a document)  [Edit: I mean this app:] img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XGiih.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer112247> While the scanner application is running, have a look at the dock to see the icon (and on right-click the name) of the scanner application itself. To start it directly, just type this name into Spotlight.  Or you can pin the scanner application to the Dock so it's always available without using Spotlight at all.  <answer112255> The fastest way to activate any program is to use the âŒ˜ + SPACEBAR shortcut to bring up Spotlight and then type in the name of the Applciation you wish to start, in this case, your scanning application name is what you would enter.  After you enter it in the spotlight search field, it should show up under the Applications heading in the Spotlight Result list, if it isn't selected already, simply use the arrow keys to highlight it and then hit enter to select it.  This is the method I use to start up many, if not all of the applications I use because it doesn't require me to lift my hand off the keyboard and I can just keep working.  <answer112267> If you make an alias of /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/Print.framework/Versions/A/Plugins/PrinterProxy.app/ to for example /Applications/Utilities/, the alias is included in the Spotlight menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qTIJh.png" alt=""  If you use Alfred, it can be configured to include all applications in the default search results:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FdWht.png" alt=""  <answer118234> Type the word scan into spotlight and click the resulting icon.   <answer182945> You could try to type-in the name of your printer inside Spotlight, the interface showing up should let you click on the "Scanner" button.  The quickest way I found so far; and I don't think you can get to that "scanner-button-interface" directly i.e: you have to go through the printer-interface.

Solution 1:  What works for me is, in Spotlight, strongto type the first letters of the name of the scanning device/strong (in my case "Epson Perfection 2400"), and open it. This opens the scanning window directly from Spotlight.   Solution 2: you can strongrename the scanner device/strong to include the word "scanner", by going to Preferences  Printers and Scanners, right-clicking (or Ctrl-clicking) on the scanner name, and rename it. In my case, I renamed it to "Epson Perfection 2400 emscanner/em". This did the trick. Now I can type "scanner" in Spotlight, and open up the scanning window directly.  <comment131796> I know that, in fact I mention it in my question. The issue is that the scanning application is part of the printer which in turn is inside System Preferences. I now realized the printer itself has a .app, although it doesn't direct me to the Scanner app it brings me closer. <comment131797> The problem is that the scanner utility is part of PrinterProxy, part of Mac OS X. I now realized I can open the printer itself looking for [PrinterName].app and then hitting Command+3 (Menu item for WindowScanner Utility). Two keystrokes is better than one keystroke and three clicks, so thanks for guiding me there. <comment131798> Having some kind of command line tool that I can launch via Spotlight to open the PrinterProxy driver in the scanner utility itself would be great, though. <comment131799> What kind of printer do you have? My HP All-in-one has a scanner software app called "HP Scan.app" that I just execute from spotlight.  Perhaps your printer manufacturer has software you can install rather than using Apple's provided scanning software which is what it sounds like you are using.
