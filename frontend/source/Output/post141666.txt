Turn all windows transparent in Mavericks <body> I have been looking around for over an hour now trying to find some way to make all my windows somewhat transparent / translucent ...  I found the app Afloat, however that app doesn't work with all other applications, only some  Any ideas on how I can turn all my windows semi-transparent in OS X Mavericks?  Thanks!  <answer141669> I believe if you open a new finder window and go into the preferences you can edit the color of the window background. From that you can then modify the alpha channel to add transparency :)  <answer213548> You cannot change the window colors in Finder itself. However, there are finger alternatives that can do this. Try Pathfinder by CocoaTech. I believe it has the option to make Finder windows transparent.  <comment166947> This only works for finder though correct? <comment166948> Sorry I misread the question. So you want the main bar (where the close,min,max buttons are located) to be translucent? <comment166956> I want the same thing you described for the finder window, but for all of my windows, 'Chrome;PhpStorm;Spotify;Notes;etc... <comment167010> I don't believe Mavericks offers this functionality natively. <comment218886> It does not. For what it's worth, I'm installing Ubuntu because I'm fed up with the limitations of OS X. <comment298334> Just "Finder" windows?
