Revoking and requesting a new distribution certificate in apple dev center <body> I'm trying update our iOS app through itunes connect. However, I'm having an issue with the iOS distribution certificate when I try to submit to the appstore. This is the error that appears to me:      Your account already has a valid iOS Distribution certificate. You   have a valid iOS Distribution certificate in the Member Center, but it   is not installed locally. If your signing identity is installed on   another Mac, you can export a developer profile on that Mac and import   it on this Mac. You can also revoke your current certificate and   request a new one.   In the dev center, the distribution certificate and the adhoc profile appears to be invalid. So I'm wondering how to revoke and request a new certificate. If I revoked the certificate, what's going to happen? are there any additional fees?   <answer200127> I had this exact problem just today (Aug 13 2015)  Go into the member center, find the certificate, and revoke it.  Leave the member center.  xcode 6+ will automatically find the certicate has been revoked and will create &amp; download a new one when you carry out an action that requires it.  I sometimes find it also helps to delete your account from Xcode-Preferences-accounts and add it back in.  Indeed it scared me the first time I tried it.
