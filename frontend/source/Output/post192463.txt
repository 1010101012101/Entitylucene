SSD partitioning fails internally, external OK <body> I bought a Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB for my MacBook Pro 13'' Early 2011, but am unable to install OS X to it. (Yosemite 10.10.3)  When installing the SSD internally, OS X doesn't find the drive, and diskutil reports the following (tested with Internet Recovery, old install on external drive and own thumb drive installer):  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0    1:                       0xEE                         250.1 GB   disk0s1 /code/pre  However, when attaching the SSD via USB (externally) the following is reported by diskutil on the same machine:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS SSD                     249.7 GB   disk0s2 /code/pre  Partitioning didn't work, hangs on "Waiting for volumes to reappearâ€¦". After installing OS X on the SSD while attached via USB and reinstalling internally, drive is not found again. Any ideas? SATA cable broken? Chipset broken?  Thank you for your help!  strongAddition/strong: The old HDD works fine internally, but is very slow (constant beach balls, more that when used externally) and has a negotiated link speed of SATA 1.5 Gbps.  <comment228925> I would agree with your assumption, the SATA cable. <comment228929> Addition: The included SATA-2 HDD works fine internally. <comment228952> Lets assume you are using external disk utility to partition internal drive.
