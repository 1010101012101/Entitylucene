Any suggestions?  <answer137224> To answer your question. I have the same configuration as you.   codeOS: Mavericks iOS: 7.1.1.  Hardware: iPhone 5s and MBP Late 2013  They are both in same wifi network./code  This is what I did:   I selected "Create Network" from the wireless icon in the menu bar. I did not specify a password. I was able to use the iPhone Remote app without failure. Since then, I've reconfigured it with a password and it also works without error.   <comment162999> Two questions, what is the "iPhone's remote app", and have you tried to create an 'Ad-hoc' wifi network using your MBP, and use that as you WiFi connection for the iTunes. <comment163019> @CousinCocaine Remote app:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/remote/id284417350?mt=8 <comment163020> @Patience Ah, that one. It is most likely your router than. I had similar issues and only got it to work on my Apple router. You will notice that creating an Ad-hoc accespoint with your mbp will fix your issue. <comment163028> Lol, so I need to exit current router's wifi to mbps network? Sorry but this is not solution <comment163029> @TuralAliyev This is a known issue with several routers. Apple has not officially announced a list of compatible devices. After researching many forums and Apple's support page, I was left with the aforementioned workaround. I am frustrated with Apple's configuration as I've had several incompatibility issues. <comment163034> @TuralAliyev, Dark_Cyber is right. You said the router wasn't the issue, but we are still not certain. Try the ad-hoc network, if that works, then your router IS the issue. <comment163036> @CousinCocaine Like I mentioned in my answer, I had the same issue as TuralAliyev. It wouldn't work until I tried the ad-hoc network option. My DLink router WAS the issue, but I still believe that Apple should be able to configure their product/application/devices to work with most devices. Considering that I tested this on two different routers: a Dlink and a Linksys router. Both are pretty popular routers. <comment163387> @TuralAliyev and @Dark_Cyber; unfortunately this is a common issue and affects me as wel :(
