Breadboard Software? <body> I am learning how to do some beginner work with electronics, so I am looking for a breadboard.  Now I know I can go down the local RadShack and pick one up, but in doing so, I'll spend $20 on a board, another $10 on wires, and possibly more on electronics I need to duplicate the entire practice they want me to do in the book.   All in all I'm not willing to shove $50 to $100 on a breadboard and it's toys just to learn something on my own just yet.   I am looking for a Breadboard software package for the Mac, either it be universal or not.  Is there such a thing as this or am I stuck spending $100 on a breadboard, electronics, and a case to keep it all organized?  <answer131471> h2iCircuit/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FOlf.png" alt=""     iCircuit is the easy to use electronic circuit simulator and designer - the perfect tool for students, hobbyists, and engineers.
