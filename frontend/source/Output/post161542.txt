However, its not a 'full wake' in that the screen does not come on, external drives don't mount etc.  My iMac does this every hour, but the screen does not come on.  <answer161583> I think this may be your Bonjour Sleep Proxy waking up your Mac to see if it's alive. Take two of these and call me in the morning:  http://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201960  And also check this:  http://ispire.me/fix-yosemite-rtc-alarm-wakeup-issue/  <answer161699> Maury is probably correct that BSP is waking your Mac while it is sleeping...     This log line indicates that you strongdo/strong appear to be connected to an Apple TimeCapsule Airport wifi network:  precode12/12/2014 04:20:59.662 airportd[84]: _doAutoJoin: Already associated to “Airport - TC1TB (5 GHz)”. Bailing on auto-join. /code/pre  This line suggests that your Mac emmay/em be waking due to a Bonjour/MDNS over the network:  precode12/12/2014 04:21:46.000 kernel[0]: ARPT: 91381.078889: wl0: powerChange: *** BONJOUR/MDNS OFFLOADS ARE NOT RUNNING. /code/pre  And this line suggests that your Mac has strongWake for Wi-Fi network access/strong enabled in the emstrongEnergy Saver/strong/em Panel of emstrongSystem Preferences/strong/em:  precode 12/12/2014 04:21:46.000 kernel[0]: ARPT: 91381.566541: wl0: leaveModulePoweredForOffloads: Wi-Fi will stay on. /code/pre  The line above indicates that it is leaving Wi-Fi enabled while your Mac is sleeping.  The two links Maury provided have information and solutions that work, but they require some interpretation:  ul lithe Apple Support article explains emWake on Demand/em and emBonjour Sleep Proxy/em but doesn't explicitly explain how to disable these features:  ul lithese should be disabled by unchecking the strongWake for Wi-Fi network access/strong and strongEnable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter/strong in the emstrongEnergy Saver/strong/em emstrongSystem Preferences/strong/em panel/li lithese features can be disabled provided you do not have your Mac providing these services while sleeping: ul liemiTunes and iPhoto Sharing/em, emPrinter Sharing/em, emBack to My Mac/em, emLocal File Sharing, Screen Sharing, other sharing services/em/li /ul/li liif you are using these features some can be done with your TimeCapsule instead/li /ul/li lithe 2nd link provides instructions to deactivate these features by disabling multicast for the discoveryd service daemon, which seems like a poorer solution than turning off these settings in the emstrongEnergy Saver/strong/em panel/li /ul  <comment188820> do you have log entries like mine? <comment188875> Haha, thanks. Ok I think this might be it. Not sure how to verify though. A friend picked up my laptop with wet hands, and I thought  possibly got the Thunderbolt port wet, causing this behaviour! <comment188899> I *suspect* that the two are not related. Normally BSP needs to have an apple-aware router for that to be the cause. What router do you use? It is an AirPort of some sort? I should have asked this in the first post... <comment188945> Yes I use a time capsule! - does this mean it's likely that this is normal behaviour? <comment189054> Yes. And it always freaked me out too, especially on my old Mac Pro which you could hear across the house. :-) Basically if you have any sort of sharing turned on, when your machine goes to sleep it hands off a message to the TC that lets the TC pretend to be your machine. Then when anyone wants to talk to your machine, the TC intercepts the messages, says "wait please", wakes your machine and hands off. To keep it working, the TC periodically wakes up the machine to re-read the list of services. And THAT is the problem - you have no control over this process other than on/off. <comment189056> Well at least it's normal! Thanks!
