Folder copy without losing any existing files <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Why does &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; replace stuff instead of merging it?       In Windows, if I overwrite a folder codeabc/doc/code to codedef/doc/code, (1) files existing in codeabc/doc/code but not in codedef/doc/code are simply added to codedef/doc/code; (2) files existing in codedef/doc/code but not in codeabc/doc/code do not change; and (3) files existing in both folders are replaced. But in Mac, all files in codedef/doc/code are deleted and files in codeabc/doc/code are copied. I am not talking about which should be the more correct behavior, but was wondering if Mac can be tuned to how Windows behave, because I am more comfortable with such behavior.  I found that Lion now behaves just like Windows, but in Snow Leopard or older version, how can I make Mac OS behave like what I described?  <answer26720> The short answer is that you cannot accomplish this using the Finder. A third-party solution like Path Finder could be what you're looking for. Path Finder can merge on paste.
