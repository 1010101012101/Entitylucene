How to list all files in directory excluding any that start with a dot? <body> I'm currently using the command   precodefind /Volumes/DriveName &gt; driveName.txt /code/pre  to create a file listing of all files that are on the drive.  How could I modify my command (or what would be a better command) to have the list not include any dot files, for example ._Filename or .DSstore?  I'm not looking for software like CDFinder etcetera to keep a searchable database. I need a text output that contains all the files on the disk, as well as their relative locations to each other.  <answer56346> To exclude files and directories add an exclusion pattern to the find command (see codeinfo find/code for more):  precodefind /Volumes/DriveName -not -path '*/.*' &gt; driveName.txt /code/pre  <answer56347> This isn't remotely Mac-specific, but you can pipe your output through codegrep/code. More particularly, the code-v/code option will exclude lines that match the pattern you are looking for (in your case, filenames beginning with a code./code).  So instead of   precodefind /Volumes/DriveName &gt; driveName.txt /code/pre  you can enter  precodefind /Volumes/DriveName | grep -v '\/\.' &gt; driveName.txt /code/pre  <answer56350> I was going to recommend codetree/code as an alternative, but I realized it's not installed by default on OS X. However if you don't mind following some straightforward instructions to compile it yourself, it might be a useful tool for your purposes. It takes any directory and gives you a nice ASCII based tree of all the subfolders and files therein (and by default it omits hidden/dot files).  Sample output:  precode~$ tree test test ├── alpha │   ├── testA │   ├── testB │   └── testC ├── num │   ├── test1 │   ├── test2 │   └── test3 ├── test X ├── test Y └── test Z /code/pre  <answer60129> You can use ListAllFiles from the App Store.  <comment64675> You could also just use `ls -R /Volumes/DriveName  driveName.txt` depending on the output format you want. <comment64829> For some reason using the -not -name is still returning results like:/Volumes/GLYPH_500//.fseventsd/000000000093d655 /Volumes/GLYPH_500//.fseventsd/fseventsd-uuid /Volumes/GLYPH_500//.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1 <comment64830> Also, ls -l is returning results like: /Volumes/GLYPH_500//.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Stores/550F2517-530C-4ECB-98BA-63799078A359: 0.indexArrays 0.indexCompactDirectory <comment64831> this one gets rid of all items .Spotlight listings etc. Thanks. <comment64833> This is because `-name` only checks the filename, to match against the whole path replace `-name` with `-path` and the pattern with `'*/.*'`. <comment64851> You are right! That totally fixed it. Could you edit your response to include that - and I'll mark it as the answer. Thanks very much for your help! <comment69306> Well, giving that you are promoting your own product here, I would have expected a bit more text and not just a link.
