How to use spotlight for system commands such as shutdown? <body> I want to type in strongSpotlight/strong commands such as codeshutdown/code, codereboot/code, codesuspend/code or codelock/code and make it execute it, just like Alfred does.  How to make this possible with Spotlight?  <comment126351> So the answer is not possible with spotlight itself? I don' t want to install alfred. <comment126366> You could save scripts for the commands as applications in AppleScript Editor. For example use `tell application "System Events" to shut down` to shut down, `tell application "loginwindow" to «event aevtrlgo»` to log out, or `do shell script "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend"` to lock the screen. <comment126368> Are you opposed to using the built in keyboard shortcuts?
