Is there a way to hide the text in the left hand column in Messages? <body> I want to hide the text under the name of the contact in the Messages app. So in the example below, it would be the text that is below the name codeMatt Brian/code.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXDUV.jpg" alt="Messages"  Is there a way to do this?  <answer236383> Yes, just drag the divider to the left.  It will shrink that area so that all you see is the names, not any of the text.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9EEGz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment289271> Exactly what I needed. Thanks!
