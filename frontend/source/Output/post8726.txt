Mixing Two MP3s in GarageBand 09 <body> I have two MP3s. One is an instrumental and one is an acapella.  I want to mix the two in GarageBand, but I can't seem to find a way to change the tempo of the tracks individually.  It looks like the new GarageBands Flex Time would work, but I would really like to be able to do it in '09.  Ideas?  <answer9401> What you're asking emcould/em be done but chances of failure are too high. The reason is you could use a plugin to alter the tempo of one of the MP3s but that will introduce two big problems:  ol liIf you change it beyond certain threshold, pops and clicks will start to be heard./li liIt will be emreally hard/em to sync them. It may look in tempo at the beginning, but a very small tempo difference will be noticeable as the tracks advance, which will require lots of micro adjustments (not good). /li /ol  My advice is to take the tracks to an Apple Store and ask the guys there if you can use a Garageband for a couple of hours. They will emrarely/em have any problem with that. There you can use Garageband or even a Logic Express (or pro!), that have a better Flex feature.
