Saving audio messages sent/received with iPhone <body> iPhone automatically deletes voice messages sent and received through iMessage within two minutes of sending one, and within two minutes of listening to one received from someone else.  How can I change the amount of time that iPhone will wait before deleting sent and received audio messages?  iPhone 5s, iOS 8  <answer172078> Go to Settings app  Messages and scroll down to codeAUDIO MESSAGES/code and codeVIDEO MESSAGES/code Under each one, there is an option labeled codeExpire/code. Tap on it and then tap codeNever/code to prevent them from being deleted automatically.  Never or two minutes are your only options, though.  <answer226264> If you want to have recording emoutside/em of iMessage (i.e. as an mp3 or whatever), then press and hold the recording in iMessage. A menu will appear with codeCopy, Save, More.../code. Select codeSave/code and your recording will now be in the strongVoice Memos/strong app. From there you can tap the share button to send as email attachment, or you can get it from iTunes when you connect your phone to a computer.
