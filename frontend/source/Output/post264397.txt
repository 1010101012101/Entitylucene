Core media authoring session helper takes lots of disk space <body> Im on i5 iMac (late 2012), El Capitan 10.11.6. Today I have cleaned my hard drive. I freed about 200 Gigabytes. The bottom bar in Finder showed me 144 Gb of free space when I glanced at it the first time. 10 minutes later it was 38 Gb! And now it's 13 Gb. It keeps being taken by something that was waiting for enough space, I suppose.  I couldn't find anything new in «All My files». But I see 172 Gb usage of disk by the process named CoreMediaAuthoringSessionHelper. The same amount the «kernel_task» holds. For now I have 3 Gb of free space left. It feels very wrong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yo1d7.png" alt="core media authoring sesstion helper taking disk space" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NyibM.png" alt="enter image description here"  It (whatever it is) couldn't be downloaded from internet. My bandwith wouldn't pass ~170 Gigs in 15 minutes. Whenever I free some more space — it's gone in five minutes.  Why do I loose the disk space I've just freed? How to get my free space back?  UPDATE. DaisyDisk helped me to locate the problem. It is a Quick Time player that took all the free space. I was careless when opened it and forced quit while the convertation process was taking place. With DaisyDisk I've found the huge file deep down in code/private/code directory. codelsof filename/code in terminal showed the process it was bind to. I've killed the process (that CoreMediaAuthoringSessionHelper) and deleted that 180Gb file. And my free space is back! Thank you klanomath!  <comment331308> You may answer your own question by mentioning the culprit (QuickTime Player convert?) and what you did to solve your problem.
