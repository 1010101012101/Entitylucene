How to access the internal hard disk with full permissions? <body> My Mac does not start anymore. The hard disk is stranded :-( Macs and gravity are not good friends.  When starting on a backup disk, I manage to see some contents of the internal disk emMacintosh HD/em, but strangely some permissions prevent me to see everything. For example, in emUsers/em, I cannot explore all the home folders.   [Edit]  ol listrongHow can I access the internal hard disk with full permissions ?/strong /li listrongWhy don't I see everything on the internal disk when it is not the boot disk ?/strong /li /ol  I want to salvage the data. To do this, I intend to do copies with the Finder.  Thank you for your insight on this delicate matter.   The internal disk, and the backup disk, have Mac OS X Snow Leopard.  <answer144020> One way to recover files from a "broken disk" without buying software, is to use the Target Disk mode.  You will need a second mac to do that, to which you would transfer the files.  <comment169624> How familiar are you with the command line interface (Terminal)? Have you tried enabling and using the root user? <comment169632> @bernk - I have not enabled the root user. <comment169633> @bernk - What is preventing me from seeing everything on the internal disk *Macintosh HD* ? For the Mac, it is just a plugged disk, it is not the boot disk. <comment169653> As you've said yourself, permissions. Using a regular admin user are you able to change the permissions of one of those folders to give yourself access? Select the folder and cmd-i to Get Info, at the bottom you'll see the permissions. You can click on the lock to change them, but this'll require an admin account. <comment186961> You are welcome, hope it works and to have saved you some money.
