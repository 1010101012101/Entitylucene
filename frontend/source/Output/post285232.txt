How can I send Midi channel to my external Synth on Logic? <body> I've connected my V-Synth through a M-Audio USB interface to my MacBook pro. On Logic I've set up a new Track, for external instruments, set the right midi channel and set the audio input to my USB Audio interface. Connected everything (Both midi IN and OUT, LR output audio channel to audio interface), and I can record midi on my track.  But I can't reproduce on my synth what I've recorded..! What am I doing wrong?
