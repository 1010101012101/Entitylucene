How to identify build number of a macOS installer? <body> Today I read:      Apple today released an updated golden master (GM) version of macOS Sierra to developers… The new GM seed is build 16A323, while the build released last week was 16A320.    After downloading, in the Finder  Get Info of ‘Install macOS Sierra.app’ I see ‘Version: 12.0.49’ but no build number.  How to identifier the build number of a macOS installer?   My goal is to verify what installer I may be using.  <answer252944> Hmm... I know when you're booted from the same major version of the OS (10.12, in this case) you can open System Image Utility and select the Install Assistant from the Sources menu and it'll tell you the build number.  But, it will only show the installer (or other volumes) that it can image, which have to match the major version of the booted system. So if you're in 10.11 now and want to see the build number of a 10.12 installer that won't work.  <answer252945> To determine the macOS Sierra GM build number use:  precodecat "/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app/Contents/Info.plist" | grep -A 1 DTSDKBuild /code/pre  Please apply the leading portion of the path if your emInstall macOS Sierra.app/em resides elsewhere.  <answer253085> To find the build number once macOS Sierra is installed:  ol liChoose Apple Menu  About This Mac /li liChoose System Report... to start System Information app/li liChoose Software from left side  /li liFrom right side find "System Version: macOS 10.12 (build number here)"/li /ol  <answer253159> The most reliable way of telling the build number is to check the SystemVersion.plist file inside the installer's OS image file (and not the build number of the installer app itself).  ol liMount code/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg/code/li liMount code/Volumes/OS X Install ESD/BaseSystem.dmg/code (hidden file)/li liOpen code/Volumes/OS X Base System/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist/code and examine the build number under code&lt;key&gt;ProductBuildVersion&lt;/key&gt;/code/li /ol  <comment314739> I've seen that value be off from the installed build though... <comment315788> yep, that's the only way. <comment347286> This Question is about the macOS install-*er* rather than the install-*ed* macOS.
