OS X 10.11—workaround for downloading El Capitan <body> I have a Mac Pro 1.1 with OS X 10.10 Yosemite and Piker Alpha bootloader. I’m trying to download OS X 10.11 El Capitan from the Mac App Store and get the following error message:     Your Purchase Could Not Be Completed.      This version of OS X 10.11 can't be installed on this computer.   Is there a workaround for this problem? I have no other compatible Mac at home.  I only want to download the dmg file to edit it manually.  <comment251643> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208660/alternative-method-to-acquire-el-capitan-upgrade for a near duplicate question. <comment251710> the answer is: change SystemVersion.plist <comment251722> Perhaps you could answer your own question.  What key(s) did you change to what value in /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist ? <comment251908> It wasn't the complete answer... if you start the mac app store and edit in the SystemVersion.plist,  you can josh the mac app store:  !-- language-all: lang-html -- /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :ProductUserVisibleVersion '10.09'" /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :ProductVersion '10.09'" /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist  For Example. Correct it after the josh, otherwise your system would be corrupted. <comment251911> so i still search for a posibility... i mean chameleon can do this, but is there a buildin way?
