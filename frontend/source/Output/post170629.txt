Any way to manage options in Open With dialog? <body> Basically, my problem is that my codeOpen With/code list looks like this for code.html/code files  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7Mch.png" alt="enter image description here"  I want to be able to manage it somehow. For example, I often open those files with PHPStorm but that list is obviously full and I have to click codeOther.../code every time for eg. PHPStorm.  I'd like to be able to remove virtualized Internet Explorers, Word and simply to be able to manage it somehow. Any way to do that?  <answer170632> You can get rid of the Windows apps by unchecking the Share options in Parallelsbr [needs to be done for each VM] img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IDsyt.png" alt="enter image description here"  To lose some of the others, I'd use RCDefaultApp - freeware - old but still working in Yosemite.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UFliX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Might need to rebuild the Launch Services afterwards -br sub as I did after taking the above picture ;-) /sub    code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user/code  <comment200635> Do you wish to categorically remove all virtualized apps or remove things more selectively. The former should be far easier than the latter. <comment200636> Rather selectively. For example I do not intend to open html via word or excel so I'd prefer more universal solution <comment200642> That looks nice but, for example, `html` extension is unchecked under MS Word so I can't uncheck it. Also checked Extensions section but there I can only set default app <comment200645> hmmâ€¦ you're right - I can't get rid of word or excel either <comment200647> There's some heavy Terminal stuff here - http://krypted.com/mac-os-x/lsregister-associating-file-types-in-mac-os-x/ <comment201587> I don't see it there, there's just how to register or unregister the default app. I want to be able to somehow manage associations between app and certain extensions so OSX won't offer me to open it with that app. Also I noticed your edit about rebuilding LS, what should it do? I don't see any difference, Default Apps still do not show `.html` under MS Word
