Can't use Apple Music with 2 OS X user accounts? <body> My wife and I share the same Mac desktop. We have 2 separate Mac user accounts and iCloud accounts. But once you sign in with one Apple Music account, it locks the computer.   Any workaround?  <comment235168> Could you please add information on your setup (OS X version and iTunes Version) and on how is it locked down? You mean you can't login with the other user? You can't switch between logged users or fast switch? It freezes? Thanks!
