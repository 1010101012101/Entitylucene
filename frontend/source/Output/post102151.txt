Boot straight into an application without showing the desktop <body> How do I boot straight into an application without showing the desktop?  Essentially I would like to turn the machine on, see the grey screen with loading icon, and then see my application. The Desktop/Dock/Menubar should never be visible. (The application itself is fullscreen)  <answer102191> You can create an AppleScript using Automator.  <answer102243> If you want to open new windows in full screen by default, I don't know any way to do it in general, but there are options for it in some applications like iTerm 2, VLC, and WriteRoom.  You could also assign a keyboard shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "Terminal"     reopen -- open a new default window if there are open default windows     set w to number of windows end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal"     if number of windows is w then -- if there are no full screen windows         perform action "AXPress" of (button 1 where subrole is "AXFullScreenButton") of window 1     end if end tell activate application "Terminal" -- make Terminal frontmost /code/pre  To automate opening a window in full screen at login, you might use a script like this:  precodeset old to window 1 tell application "Terminal"     reopen end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal"     perform action "AXPress" of (button 1 where subrole is "AXFullScreenButton") of window 1 end tell delay 1.5 activate old /code/pre  <comment120342> Seen may, this is one of them. <comment120359> and then what ? <comment120523> But this still shows the desktop whilst the script is executed. I have amended the question.
