Is there a way to insert the current date in Notes? <body> In iOS8, is there an easy way to insert the current date (or current date/time) in Notes?  <comment217030> You could make a script with Xcode... Simple. If you need, I will include code in final answer. I am on iPad, so I can't do it now <comment217755> I have no idea how to make a script with xcode, get it onto my phone, or run it. If you can provide any such details, that would be awesome -- thanks! <comment217863> I ain't on my computer now, so I will paste something once I can :)
