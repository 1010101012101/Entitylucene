Software to generate photo gallery HTML with download links <body> I have the following requirement: A software that runs on OS X which takes a number of image files and creates a HTML gallery out of them.  It needs to have the following features:  ul liCaption and description on a main thumbnail page./li liMedium size pages for each image, which is scaled down to like 600Ã—600 pixels. If some IPTC info is shown, that is great, but not a strict requirement./li liDownload links to the full resolution image./li /ul  FotoStation is able to do exactly this, however it is rather costly for this single use.  Is there any program that can do this?  <answer125897> I use Jalbum. It's very practical and has tons of features and skins. You can find it here : http://jalbum.net/en/  <comment147358> It is not free but very powerful with many features. <comment147378> I played around with it, but I did not find the option to include the full size image. Are you sure that is in there? <comment147440> In the setting=images, you have a possibility to create a link to original images. Now, I'm not sure for the download link (icon)
