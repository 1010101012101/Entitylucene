Macbook pro OS X 10.9 can only access internet through safari <body> My Macbook pro shows it is connected to the wifi. I can access internet through Safari. But I can not access with any other software or tool like firefox, chrome, opera, terminal. Even my Skype and dropbox also can not access internet.  Best regards and thanks.  <comment190217> Is this an open Wi-Fi, or are you going through a proxy of some sort?
