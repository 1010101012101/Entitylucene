CleanMymac alternatives <body> Is there another software to uninstall applications without leaving confit files without having to manually navigate in those directories and delete them one by one?  Thanks  <comment353737> There are several but non of them remove all the files <comment353744> Seems like you're not looking for a complete CleanMyMac alternative, just an app which will perform the app uninstallation feature of CleanMyMac. Let me know if this is incorrect, otherwise see the linked question. <comment353746> Yes, you're right @grgarside , thanks! <comment353751> Unfortunately, nothing can reliably remove all of an application's files, all the time. The best that most app cleaners can do is to uninstall all the files that were created at install time. However, there's no reliable way to know what additional files an application created while it was running. For those ones, you have to rely on the app developer posting uninstall instructions, or providing an uninstaller.
