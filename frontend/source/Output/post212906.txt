Mount SquashFS under El Capitan or alternative to SquashFS? <body> I am converting some .tar.gz to SquashFS (using squashfs from homebrew) using xz compression because I want to be able to mount the archives and read the content without extrating and also because the compression is about 10% better in my case.  Now I only found one implementation of SquashFS for OSXFuse here.  I am wondering:   ul liis it possible to mount SquashFS natively under OS X?  /li liIs there another fuse driver? /li liIs there a more OSXish compressed file system I could use (it should be OS X and Linux)?/li /ul  <answer262675> If you have homebrew installed, it's as easy as running codebrew install squashfs/code, and then either codeunsquashfs/code or codemksquashfs/code depending on if you want to extract or make a comrpessed filesystem.  Or if you don't have or don't want homebrew you can follow this guide to build those to executables yourself: https://www.openviewmobile.com/2015/10/13/build-squashfs-tools-for-mac-os-x/
