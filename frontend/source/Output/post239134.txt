Do you need an @icloud.com email to get @icloud.com email aliases? <body> If you sign up for an Apple ID with a non-apple email account (gmail, etc.) can you still sign up for iCloud email aliases (alias@icloud.com)?  <answer239138> Yes you can. Set up the primary ID as your gmail and secondary as an iCloud account  <comment293506> Are you implying that the sign up process with a Gmail address will prompt the user if they would also like an iCloud email address? <comment293508> I had made my account using my Outlook ID. I added another ID as my iCloud ID in the secondary ID
