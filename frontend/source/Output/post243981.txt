launchctl gives permission error <body> I have a user named 'tv' (OS X 10.11.5) and I have these files in /Users/tv/Library/LaunchAgents/  precode# ls -lsa /Users/tv/Library/LaunchAgents/ total 16 0 drwxr-xr-x   4 tv  staff   136 Jun 24 20:46 . 0 drwx------@ 50 tv  staff  1700 May 19 11:05 .. 8 -rw-r--r--@  1 tv  staff   487 Dec 24  2015 com.bittorrent.uTorrent.plist 8 -rw-r--r--   1 tv  staff   559 Jun 24 20:46 com.drzoidberg33.plexpy.plist /code/pre  I get codePath had bad ownership/permissions/code when I try to load either file. I've rebooted, changed the group to wheel, tried to manually load them repeatedly, but I always get the same error. The permissions look exactly the same as on my normal user account:  precode$ ls -lsa Library/LaunchAgents/ total 8 0 drwxr-xr-x   8 lbutlr  staff   272 Oct  8  2015 . 0 drwx------@ 63 lbutlr  staff  2142 Apr  2 02:11 .. 8 -rw-r--r--   1 lbutlr  staff   452 Mar 30  2015 com.kreme.home.randsig.plist $ launchctl load /Users/lbutlr/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kreme.home.randsig.plist  /Users/lbutlr/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kreme.home.randsig.plist: service already loaded` /code/pre  This link is similar, but is dealing with root permissions inside the /Library folder  <answer248382> The issue turned out to be that the executable referenced in the ProgramArguments inside the plist was not executable. Doh!  <comment300554> What if you sudo? `sudo launchctl load /Users/...` <comment300555> Sudo result in the exact same error. <comment300558> And if you chmod 0777 temporarily ? <comment300678> That would definitely not work the plist files cannot be world or group writable.
