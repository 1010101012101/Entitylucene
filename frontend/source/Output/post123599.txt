How to edit the /etc/hosts file? <body> When I open the file with TextEdit (I don't want (truly, I am not able) to use vim), it is seen as "locked", even if I modify the permissions of the file via the "Get Info" window.  How can I modify the hosts file with TextEdit?  <answer123600> ol liOpen TextEdit as sudo  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo -b /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /code/pre/li liOpen /etc/hosts in this new TextEdit instance using any of the following methods:  ul liAppend the path to the end of the previous command/li liUse File â†’ Open/li liDrag the file to the sudo'd TextEdit on the Dock/li /ul/li /ol  hr  Alternatively, you can edit in Terminal using nano:  precodeSUDO_EDITOR=nano sudo -e /etc/hosts /code/pre  Using codesudo -e/code ensures that temporary files etc. are handled in the proper way and you don't run into permission issues with them. codenano/code is a simple console-based editor which is quite user-friendly.  <answer123604> In one line, from Terminal:   precodesudo -b "/Applications/Textedit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit" /etc/hosts /code/pre  Make your changes, save and close.   <answer123618> If you like simple, you can research vim tool which installed on MacOS: sudo vi /etc/hosts  <answer123700> You could try TextWrangler for this sort of thing; much more capable than TextEdit, and if you use the direct install from BareBones Software instead of the App Store version, it will happily open locked files. When you try, it asks permission, reminding you that you are not a member of the required group, but password entry will allow you to open and edit the file. Plus, it has optional command line additions (also not built in to App Store version) that will allow you to use TextWrangler by entering codeedit (name of file)/code to open things directly from Terminal. Open File dialog has a handy "show invisibles" option to help you open and edit hidden or dot-prefixed files too. It's a free app so no risk in trying.   <answer208977> precodesudo nano /private/etc/hosts /code/pre  to edit the hosts file within Terminal, Control-O to save, then hit enter  <comment144361> I found `nano` to be a more approachable terminal-based text editor than `vim` for simple task like this. <comment224844> I'm on Mountain Lion and this doesn't work for me unfortunately. Whenever I try to change something I get an error "You don't own the file hosts and don't have permission to write to it". <comment345496> Works Perfectly Fine. <comment350474> Update for posterity: TextWrangler is now being deprecated, so BBEdit instead (TextWrangler was a "light" version of BBEdit, current unlicensed versions of BBEdit will have the same functionality as TextWrangler after the demo period expires. Switching to BBEdit even retains your old TextWrangler preferences - which is a nice touch.
