MacBook Pro creates soft hissing sound through headphones <body> Recently I got a quite nice pair of in-ear headphones which block noise very well (with a very tight seal, not noise cancellation). Before that, I used Apple earbuds.  With these better headphones, I'm now often hearing a hissing noise. This happens constantly while a sound is being played (music, alerts, etc.) and for several seconds after. I assume this was happening with my previous headphones but there wasn't a good enough seal for me to hear it.  This doesn't happen with my iPod or iPad. How can I stop it from happening?  <answer42746> Tough to know for certain, but my money is on an impedance mismatch between the output of the Macbook and your new headset. Or, perhaps more accurately stated, excessively sensitive (low impedance) headphones are revealing flaws in the MacBook audio output circuit.  Care to share the model of headphones you're now using? My guess is it's a low-impedance model intended for use with portable audio devices.  You can boost the impedance by adding an in-line volume control adaptor like the Shure EA650. You will find other suggestions for solving this problem, including some DIY answers, by searching the forums at Head-Fi.org  For more information/background see: emImpedance, and how it affects audio equipment/em by Rod Elliot and Sound On Sound: emUnderstanding Impedance/em.  hr  Another possible solution: I have M-Audio powered monitors plugged into my MacBook Pro, and plug my Etymotic earplugs into the headphone jack on the monitors for private listening. I haven't noticed any noise problems with this set-up.  <answer54642> I have had the same hissing with my MacBook Pro and a pair of Sennheiser CX300-II in-ear headphones. I solved this by changing the output format of the Built-in Output device from  48kHz/2ch-16bit to 48kHz/2ch-32bit.  This can be done as following:  ul liOpen codeAudio MIDI Setup/code. Use Spotlight to find it or find the application in your Utilities folder/li liMake sure your headphones are plugged in/li liClick on `Built-in Output'/li liOn the right it will say codeSource: Headphones/code and format will be code48000.0 Hz / 2ch-16bit/code/li liClick on code2ch-16bit/code and choose code2ch-32bit/code from the drop down menu/li /ul  I choose code2ch-32bit/code, but I've noticed that any other value than code2ch-16bit/code already eliminates the noise.  I am still in the process of figuring out why this works, anyone with more understanding of this issue, please feel free to edit my answer accordingly.  <answer72745> I had the same buzz noise as questioned. Though, it went away when i unplugged my MacBook from the adapter. The buzz appeared every time i used a specific power socket. Changing the power socket made the noise go away.  <answer127464> Unplug from power outlet, "problem solved". Noise stopped, although this is a main issue from the power connector from the mac.  Good luck to you all.  Cheers.  <answer140803> I actualy heard the hiss when music isn’t on using earphones. i have beats pro heaphones. i found that when i disconnect power mag safe from macbook the hiss disapears completely. i guess it is electrical interference. also hear interference when i switch off heater when magsafe is connected. :D  <answer144035> Thanks to Bart Arondson for tips to solving my own issue. I've posted details in case they're helpful to someone else.  I'm using a Heil PR40 Mic (Dynamic microphone) with a Mackie VLZ4 mixer, and was disappointed that (after spending a lot on equipment) I had an unacceptable hiss on my audio, regardless of output (headphones, speakers, etc.)  Following Bart's lead to the Audio MIDI Setup I changed the Input from the mixing board. I changed the Format to 24000 Hz, with 1ch-16bit Integer.  Frequencies below 24000 sounded hollow/aquarium-like, and frequencies above created the hiss/ringing that had been driving me crazy. Also, using the 2ch-16bit and the 1ch-8bit settings were unacceptable. Apologies if I mucked the link to the screenshot!  ![screenshot of Audio MIDI settings] https://www.dropbox.com/s/fmag17do6msqdyx/Screenshot%202014-09-03%2011.20.24.png?dl=0  <answer168000> Hope this helps some of you, what solved my issue was the following,  ul liOpen Terminal /li litype cd /Library/Preferences/Audio and press Enter type/li lils and press Enter you should see two files, com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist and com.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist/li litype sudo rm com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist and press Enter it will prompt you for your password/li litype sudo rm com.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist and press Enter this will delete the audio settings for your OS /li litype sudo killall coreaudiod and press Enter that will restart the audio system and all should be working now, at least, it did for me./li /ul  <answer286359> If the hissing sound goes away when on battery power, then you may a floating ground when you are plugged in.

While it's difficult to tell without testing, in general I would equate "hums" with grounding problems while your issue is most likely something else—see my answer. A *hiss* is not a *hum* is not a *pop/crackle*. <comment48646> I'm using the MEElectronics M9-BK (quite cheap, but quite good). Is there any kind of *software* method of increasing impedance? As far as I can tell, it would need to be hardware, but I wouldn't mind being pleasantly surprised. ;) <comment48651> *Solve electrical problems electrically and acoustic problems acoustically* — Bob Heil. An obtuse of saying this is *not* something you fix with software. <comment48654> Okay, so now I've learned that impedance is not directly rated to cost. ;) The specs I found rate the impedance of your M9-BK's at 16Ω. By comparison my Etymotic E6's are rated at 48Ω but their E6i, designed specifically for "iPods" is also rated at 16Ω—the lower impedance helps eek a little more *oomph* out of the low-powered amplifiers in portable electronics—not a bad thing if that's the device you're driving them with. Bottom line, try increasing the impedance, or use different "cans" with your Macbook. <comment48657> I wouldn't assume that it will fix *your* problem, but it will fix it for some people experiencing hiss through low impedance headsets so I think you're safe in accepting it. <comment62597> I have the same experience as @LauriRanta, though I hope it's not a 24-speakered set of headphones! <comment62612> ok, weird. That means I had a different problem... <comment84466> I suggest you or an electrician take a look at how that particular socket is wired. It may be ungrounded or mis-wired. <comment84493> This has solved my problem. Thanks! <comment175503> I don't get the downvotes.  This worked for me! <comment230573> Unfortunately it solves the issue, but it's hard to live without power :( <comment261957> zero noise. pure magic. <comment275407> My hero! Problem occurred after updating to el capitan
