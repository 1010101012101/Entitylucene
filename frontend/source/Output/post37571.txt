Does anyone have idea about it?  Thanks. Mandeep     <answer37572> Did you run an upgrade on the Snow Leopard ?? If so just try a fresh lion install. Many people who have had this problem had a well working system after they did a fresh install instead of an upgrade. You should also check your harddrive with diskutil if there are any failures.  Did you recently add or remove any commonly used usb or bluetooth devices ? Or did you change your hardware configuration ?  <answer37579> It looks to be your Android emulator causing the issue, so it won't do you much good talking about it here. Take a look at the issue linked below and see if it appears to be a similar scenario. Some of the arm stuff has been known to cause kernel panics and such, so let the developers know of the issues so they can fix them. good luck!  ul li[Android emulator / Lion issues]/li li[Project Home / Issue List]/li /ul  <answer37580> there are a lot of threads around with issue.  One such thread seesm to point to the Blackberry kext (com.rim.driver.BlackBerryUSBDriverInt   0.0.68) as the culprit.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3506955?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <comment42639> good try, but wrong answer. Look above that where it states ** BSD process name corresponding to current thread: emulator-arm** — the corresponding current thread is key here. <comment42642> quite possibly, but as you probably well know, that might be what crashed, but not the root cause. but thanks for the quick crash log reader lesson +1 <comment42643> Sure thing, and hope you don't take it the wrong way — I would be interested to understand why you feel it would be something different. <comment42644> crash usually happened when eclipse and Android emulator is opened on my machine. <comment42645> I'm sure a 'fresh install' is the last thing someone who just installed wants to do. Sure, rid the problem (temporarily), until they install the problem again. :-p <comment42648> yep; file a bug. (updated the answer with a more relevant thread that might help). <comment42650> He stated that he updated, so in my eyes that's not what you call a 'FRESH' install. Fresh install means empty harddrive - install system, not SL installed and then UPDATE to Lion.(like he said ;) ) <comment42653> Not at all, I'm only a rookie Obj-C developer, but I've been developing on other systems for over 25 years.  Invariably, code without correct exception handling has casued me more sleepless nights than I can remember. And I know from this experience that where an exception is thrown and handled is not always where the actual exception is thrown or what the root cause of the issue actually is. <comment42654> There are threads regarding the Android emulator problem all over the internet. Maybe you should refer to xda developers ? <comment42657> I realize what you're saying, although unless it's a brand new mac OS X v10.6.6 or later is **required** to install Lion. If nothing is migrated during the upgrade then yes, the system is less likely to have an issue; that is until something such as what actually caused the issue is installed. Personally I would rather just get rid of the issue rather than waste time re-installing for no apparent reason. <comment42660> @shitake83 why? android is made by google, not xda developers. <comment42663> thanks for your explanation; i just like to see things from all angles if possible. I agree it's not always obvious about the cause of an issue, and having those sleepless nights is not fun. I think you'll love working with Cocoa/Objective-C. It's tough to go back to anything else once you do. ~ best regards <comment42743> yes but I don't think google is going to help with this. xda developers is an active android developing community where people have also gone through this problem @ioi
