How to see file name in Finder search results using macOS Sierra <body> It appears that Finder search results are displayed using metadata instead of the file name. I want to know the file name for the file in the results.  You can see in the first screenshot there are 3 files that simply say "Altitude" in the Name column, which is extremely unhelpful. The second screenshot shows the folder they are in outside of Finder's search results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hj255.png" alt="screenshot 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Otf1r.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer271100> Open finder, go to finder preferences in the left corner.  Go to advanced.It should appear a window like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jzJv1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Select show all filename extensions and you're done.  <comment340357> This doesn't answer the question, but may help: you can see the actual file name of a file by selecting it and opening Get Info (command-`I`), or the inspector (option-command-`I`) if you want it to update as your selection changes. <comment341515> Unfortunately this does not answer the question. I do have that checked already and macOS ignores it in the search results. You can see in my screenshot they are not displaying the filename at all.
