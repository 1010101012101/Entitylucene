MacBook Pro SSD issue <body> I brought new SSD 240 GB and I using this SSD by Caddy. The SSD is showing in Finder. I can format it. The SMART Status is verified. But when I try to install any OS or restore my OS, it goes into infinity. I tried normal install and Time Machine restore.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iNYjW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Something is wrong, I can't install any OS on the new SSD. Any suggestions, please?   <comment370325> Have you partitioned it to be a GUID HFS+ Journaled non-case sensitive volume? <comment370386> Can you add a picture of the settings for the SSD underneath the Kingston?
