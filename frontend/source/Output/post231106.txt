Mac Terminal app - unable to use the up arrow to load previous commands when using SSH on remote server ( ^[[A ) <body> I'm running into a weird issue where the UP arrow no longer restores commands previously entered on a remote server during SSH session:  precode:~ user$ ssh user@myserver //... type the password, get welcome message $ ^[[A  //&lt;- This is what I see when pressing up arrow on the server $ ls //&lt;- I expect to see my previous commands to be visible /code/pre  strongHow can I make Terminal recall commands entered on a remote server when pressing the Up arrow?/strong This is the behavior that I've observed previously, currently running OSX 10.11.2  <answer231113> Please try to temporarily change your shell, type the name of the shell:  precode$ /bin/csh  /code/pre  See if that fixes your arrow key. If so, your shell or shell profile is having the cause of the problem.  Possible solutions:  ol liFix your current shell or shell profile./li liYou can change to a different shell permanently./li /ol  Reference: Mac OS X: How to change the Terminal shell  <answer290671> Try this:  precodeecho $HISTSIZE /code/pre  If that number is negative or zero, it will cause the behaviour you're seeing. You need to set it to a positive number in your remote ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc depending on the remote OS).  precodeexport HISTSIZE=100000 /code/pre  <comment282288> Thanks, I poked aroudn the settings and see that the terminal window has "SSH" in the window title, as opposed to csh or tcsh. Not sure how to fix that particular profile <comment290196> what shell is running on the server?
