iPhone game center nickname <body> I used my nickname on iPhone 5's Game Center before I changed my Apple ID to [appleid]@cloud.com. After changing my Apple ID to an @icloud.com account, I then deleted my old Apple ID from my iPhone. Now both my nickname and scores disappeared.  Is there any way to get my nickname and scores back?  <answer76663> You can log into your old account again directly in the GameCenter app:  ul listart GameCenter/li ligo to your profile and scroll down/li litap on your account name (at the bottom) to log out/li lilog in with the old account/li /ul  <comment88901> So you changed Apple IDs entirely? Or just the [email associated with the Apple ID](http://support.apple.com/kb/HE40)?
