Why does "if exists" fail with a false positive? <body> The file, "Test.file" in the below code does not exist, yet the script returns true. Why? What am I doing wrong?  precodeset thePath to (path to application support folder from user domain)  if exists thePath &amp; "Test.file" then display dialog "The file was found!" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 else display dialog "The was file wasn't found." buttons {"OK"} default button 1 end if /code/pre  <answer112556> You need to reference a file for the test to function properly.  precodeset thePath to path to application support folder from user domain tell application "System Events" to exists file ((thePath as text) &amp; "Test.file") /code/pre  With the conditional:  precodeset thePath to path to application support folder from user domain tell application "System Events" to exists file ((thePath as text) &amp; "Test.file") if the result then     display dialog "The file was found!" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 else     display dialog "The was file wasn't found." buttons {"OK"} default button 1 end if /code/pre  <comment132220> The code does not compile with conditional. <comment132239> I have added the syntax for the conditional.
