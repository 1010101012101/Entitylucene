Modern VJ Software <body> I've been playing around with GrandVJ and it's reasonably compelling software. My initial problem is that it's corrupted my video output twice already in the first few days of using it, requiring a restart each time.  I'm looking for a piece of software that is well-integrated into the OS X environment, supports Quartz Composer (.qtz) files, and has support for external controllers such as the NuVJ or a supported Ableton Live controller.  <answer16807> Give VDMX a try.  See this thread for info on using the NuVJ (and other MIDI controllers).  <comment22748> VDMX was quite overwhelming at first, but I was attracted by a couple of the pre-fab visualizations. I suspect it will be much better after I obtain a controller :).  Thanks for the recommendation.
