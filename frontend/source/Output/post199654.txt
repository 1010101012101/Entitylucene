How to change system "Hide All" keyboard shortcut? <body> I've looked through the list of all keyboard shortcuts in codeSettings app -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Shortcuts/code but I can't find the one for "Hide all (other) windows".  The default is strongCMD-OPT-H/strong but it conflicts with another application. I'm also looking for a way to change it's shortcut, as an alternative. But in the meantime, does anyone know how/where to change this default shortcut?  I've googled it, looked in the OS X system help, and searched through the Settings app, but I can't seem to find it. Thanks!  emNote:  I'm using OS X Yosemite (10.10.4)/em  <answer199659> You have to add it manually in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts &gt; App Shortcuts/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TY0fu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment240403> Thanks. That worked, except that the `CMD-OPTION-H` command also still "Hides Others." Is there anything else I can do to disable that? I've never used that command intentionally, so I doubt it will cause me any problems to disable it. <comment240929> That's strange, once changed `CMD-OPTION-H` does nothing for me.
