MacBook Pro runs fans at full speed constantly <body> I have a 2009 MacBook Pro A1278 running at 6500+ RPM all the time.  When I ran the hardware test, it showed:     4MOT/1/40000003: Exhaust-7358   I tried NVRAM reset, SMC reset. Nothing worked.  <answer110906> Your temperature sensors could be mis-reading. What do they report? You can check them with a program like iStatMenus. If the readings are stuck on the max temperature the fans would stay on.  <answer145947> It could be an app or a service running in the background, f.e. mdworker (Spotlight) hung up on indexing a file.   Have you checked with Activity Monitor.app (in /Applications/Utilities/) if there is anything taking up an unusual amount of cpu-time?   Also a quick look into the console would perhaps show some related errors. Post anything that seems out of the ordinary here.  Just to be sure: Have you installed any Software recently, like 'FanControl', 'HDD Fan Control' etc., and deleted it afterwards? I had one case in which the same symptoms appeared after an unclean uninstall.  <answer189683> Have you ever opened your macbook pro to clean it from dust? I have seen this symptom quite a few times, and the macs having their fans run at full-speed most of the time -especially with video playing, mostly flash on web- and the reason was that the fans and the inside of mac was full of dust.  Usually you can clean it up with compressed air, but I had success εωεν with a vacuum cleaner - just be gentle and careful.   <comment130562> Hi, it reads 40 C in SMC fan  control. Should i install istat? <comment225021> I believe that iStatMenus has a demo period, which should be long enough for you to figure this out.
