Viewing a mms:// live broadcast on my Desktop? <body> I want to view an upcoming live broadcast on my MacBook Pro The URL is mms://media.citris.berkeley.edu/webcast  I am only familiar with MMS with use on Mobile Phones, not desktops.  Is there a desktop application which can view the MMS protocol?  <answer43458> h1VLC Player/h1  You can also take a look at the VLC features list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLdTO.png" alt="enter image description here"
