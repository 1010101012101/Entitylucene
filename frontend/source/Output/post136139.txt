How to safely log in if it is busy? <body> Macbook pro, bought in 2012. I am copying something from my movable disk to my mac, and a few minutes later the screen was off, upon waking it up, it asked for password, however, I can't even type the password since the cursor is a busy cursor. I've been waiting for more than half a hour. How can I stop the copying operation and log back in?  I don't want to force shutting down my computer {5s holding the on/off button}. Any ideas?  <comment161413> You mean the rainbow wheel? I've never seen this happen on my Mac, and you should be able to type the password anyway regardless of the cursor (and without even using the mouse). <comment161421> Related question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129754/how-to-get-my-screen-responding-again <comment161425> The rainbow wheel is able to move around, but the password window is not able to type in. :( <comment161436> it should be done by now ? the rainbow wheel indicates system resource are maxed out, usually it goes away after a while. Try cmd-tab to switch windows.
