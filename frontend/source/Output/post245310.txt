How to contact a user who wrote a review to my app? <body> I have published an app in the App Store. Now one of the customers/buyer wrote a review regarding a technical issue.   How can I contact that person? In the review I can only see the author's pseudonym.   <answer245355> It's not possible. If you wish to help users you could list an email adress in your app and/or let them immediately email to it. Apple does not allow you to reply to user reviews in the app store.   <answer277926> Since a few days, you now have the ability to answer to reviews, right from iTunes Connect.  Go to strongMy Apps  YourApp  Activity  Reviews/strong and you will be able to click on strongAnswer/strong for each review.   Your answers will be available directly from the App Store for people running on iOS 10.3, and delI think/del the reviewer also receive a mail delor notification/del that you answered.  strongIt a huge step from Apple to finally offer this !/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bLHDR.png" alt="Apple doc"
