How to view public Exchange calendars from iCal? <body> In my company, people use shared Exchange calendars to organize their work. They see all the public calendars in Exchange after they login. Sadly, this doesn't work for me on Mac: after adding the Exchange account in System Preferences I see only my own Exchange calendar and none of the shared ones. I read here about using delegation, but I don't know what e-mail to type there, as others see these calendars just as "public". Any hints?  <answer169082> I just had this problem on mail.app and just figured it out using the instructions on this page.  The instructions on the linked page are for ical.  I don't have access to ical so I can't confirm that it works on ical.  But it works well on calendar.app.  So... I'm hoping it will work just the same for you.    Here are the steps:   ol liLogin to Outlook Web Access (the web interface for your Exchange Server)./li liClick on public folders (for me, it was all they way in the bottom left).  /li liThe, navigate to the public folder of your choice (I needed a calendar).  /li liRight click on the public calendar and select copy from the context menu./li liNavigate back to your own mailbox (I clicked "mail" in the lower left). /li liRight click on your own calendar and click paste (I added it to a new folder). /li liReturn to iCal and refresh (not sure how you do that in iCal).  /li /ol  Hope it works as well for you as it just did for me!  <answer235569> The answer from D.Woods is good if the calendar you are trying to access is not being actively updated (for example an office holiday calendar). Otherwise, if other users are actively add and removing appointments, the solution will not keep the calendars in sync. You could work around this by periodically repeating the process but this is less than ideal.   Currently, there does not appear to be a general purpose solution for this issue.   <answer248097> The above doesnt' REALLY work for people, especially not with Outlook 365. Here's the way that worked for me:  ol liWith iCal open go to the menu bar at the top of the screen and select iCal, it's to the right of the Apple Symbol in the upper left corner./li liSelect Preferences/li liOnce the Preferences window comes up select the Accounts section then select the Exchange account to bring up its information./li liNow select the Delegation tab./li liUnder the list is a + sign. Click this to add a calendar./li liBegin typing the user's name as above and the auto-completion will begin. Once you've found the correct user's name select it to add it under the Users column./li liUnder Accounts I can access: you will now see that user's name. You can enable or disable their calendar from displaying by checking or unchecking the boxes under the Show header./li /ol  I found these instructions from the USC website.  <answer293747> None of these fixes worked for me. I seemed to find a workaround though. Just FYI my situation was for accessing a shared calendar from Office 365 through iCal on a Mac, El Capitan. I'm running Windows 10 on a separate PC, Outlook 2013.  ul liSync the Mail app on the Mac with your Exchange account/li liOpen Outlook on the PC, Calendars and right-click the calendar you want to share./li liClick "Share", and "Email Calendar.." /li liSend the invite that it creates to yourself in Exchange/li liOpen up that email in the Mail app on the Mac and double click the .ics file that it should contain. It should open it up in iCal. /li liSelect the dropdown in the "Adding a new event" dialog and select "New Calendar" and click OK./li liYou should now see it listed under the 'On My Mac" menu./li liThis calendar is synced too so when edited somewhere else, all you need to do is close/reopen the app./li /ul  <comment198640> Calendar.app is just a new name for iCal. Thanks, your solution works great! Having to go to the webapp every time was really bugging me. <comment312897> Is this a static copy or really a link to the public (dynamic) calendar?
