How do I configure slapd as a simple LDAP "addressbook" server on OS X? <body> h3The background/h3  I need to set up an LDAP server that acts as the company's "public phonebook", so that or PBX system can access it. It needs to hold a hundred or more client phone numbers an such. I looked into Open Directory and slapd and it looks like it could do that.   While we have a Yosemite server, I don't think using its Open Directory feature would work; as far as I understand it, that is only serving up information about the user accounts on that server.  Disclaimer: My knowledge about LDAP is very limited, and about SASL is none (so I tried to avoid SASL authentication.)  h3The problem/h3  I can launch codeslapd/code and access it from ldapsearch in a limited fashion; but I cannot add objects to the LDAP database.  h3My experiments so far/h3  I have created a codeslapd.conf/code file (copied and modified codeslapd.conf.default/code)   I have launched slapd:  precodesudo /usr/libexec/slapd -dAny /code/pre  I can access it using codeldapsearch/code:  precode$ ldapsearch -x # extended LDIF # # LDAPv3 # base &lt;&gt; (default) with scope subtree # filter: (objectclass=*) # requesting: ALL #  # search result search: 2 result: 32 No such object  # numResponses: 1 /code/pre  But when I try to add an object, it won't let me:  Using "simple" authentication (I assume this means "anonymous"?)  precode$ ldapadd -x -f ~/ldapobject.txt  adding new entry "cn=Barbara Jensen,dc=my-domain,dc=com" ldap_add: Strong(er) authentication required (8)     additional info: modifications require authentication /code/pre  Using "real" authentication:  precode$ ldapadd -X 'dn:cn=Manager,dc=my-domain,dc=com' -f ~/ldapobject.txt  SASL/SRP authentication started Please enter your password:  ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Authentication method not supported (7)     additional info: SASL(-4): no mechanism available: no secret in database /code/pre  This is even though I thought I had modified codeslapd.conf/code to allow this (actually, anything - I know this must be secured before deployment):  precode# Sample access control policy: # (...) access to * by * write # (...) # if no access controls are present, the default policy # allows anyone and everyone to read anything but restricts # updates to rootdn.
