Can I Boot VMWare or Parallels from an internal OS X hard drive? <body> The SSD on my MacBook has 4 partitions, each of which has a bootable installation of strongOS X/strong. Is there any way to boot from one of these partitions with a virtualization app? strongI don't want to create an image from it/strong, just boot directly to the drive within an app.   It looks like Parallels and VMWare will only boot from images. I want to boot directly from the existing partition on my HD.   <answer99173> Parallels Desktop 8 can run Windows from a Boot Camp partition.

VMWare Fusion Overview  I believe Boot Camp support is available in earlier versions of both products, but it's definitely in the current shipping versions.  <comment116592> Parallels can boot a Windows Bootcamp partition. I don't know if it can do the same with other OS X partitions but I think it could, it would be similar to support. <comment116599> Unfortunately I'm not interested in booting Windows, I want to boot *OS X*.
