TextMate: open file windows is weird <body> In TextMate, I have recently my open file that is become weird:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yK5IY.png" alt="Textmate open file"  No way to come back to a normal window.  Does anyone know how to do?  <answer223511> Try deleting the code~/Library/Preferences/com.macromates.TextMate.preview.plist/code file while TextMate is closed and then reopen it.  Note: You might want to backup the file first before deleting it.
