Deploy Blueprint Without Activating Phone <body> Currently I am working on upgrading iPhones from the 5s to the 6s for some of our users. These users work varying distances away from our office, which causes an issue for us. Any time I try to enroll a new Blueprint with a certificate on it, it states that the "activation record cannot be found". Clearly I don't want to cut off the other phone to activate this new one. Does anyone know a way around this? I would like to be able to install a blueprint with a certificate without activating the phone.
