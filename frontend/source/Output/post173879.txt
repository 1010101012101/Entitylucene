truecrypt 7.1a requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later on Yosemite 10.10 <body> After reading articles about the state of Truecrypt in February 2015, I decided to download the last stable version of Truecrypt that allows full usage of Truecrypt: that is, version 7.1a     7.2 version that can only be used to view, but no longer to create new, TrueCrypt volumes.   see https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm  I then proceeded to install this on my Mac, running on Yosemite 10.10  But I got the error message "truecrypt 7.1a requires  Mac OS X 10.4 or later", see below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xFUml.png" alt="truecrypt 7.1a requires  Mac OS X 10.4 or later on Yosemite 10.10"  I guess it's simply a schoolboy error from a developer of the Truecrypt team, as it considers 10.4 being above 10.10, or maybe it's rather Apple who messed up &amp; should have consistantly used 2 digits after the dot (i.e. use 10.04 rather than 10.4).  In any case, I find myself unable to install Truecrypt. Anyone found a solution for this?  <answer173880> ol liCopy the mpkg from inside the downloaded disk image onto your Desktop./li liRight click the mpkg file and choose Show Package Contents, then open the Contents folder./li liOpen distribution.dist with a text editor./li liRemove lines 13 to 18.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UEruB.png" width="569"/li liSave the file and open the mpkg normally./li /ol  <answer173881> ul liOpen Terminal and enterbr codesudo nano /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist/codebr and enter your admin password./li liChange the two strings "10.10" to "10.9".

But I'd rather change the install script of truecrypt rather than touch the OS config files. <comment204634> @AdrienBe That's true...probably it's a bit faster but more dangerous <comment213132> Please do not offer solutions that tamper with system files and affect whole system rather than the application involved in the question. <comment214313> Perfect!!!!! Just changed the ''distribution.dist'' <comment214314> @EugeneBujak Your point has merit, but please make it about what you are comfortable and not about telling someone what not to write here. I learn a lot from the answers (even unsafe ones or ones you shouldn't do without a backup net) that stray from what's trivially undoable. <comment219581> Note that one has to move the mpkg off the mounted dmg otherwise file is read-only. <comment242451> @pdeschen how do you do that? <comment242452> @Super See step 1 <comment242466> @pdeschen I don't know how to look inside dmg <comment242467> @Super Open it and it mounts in /Volumes, and is shown on the desktop and the Finder sidebar if you have the relevant preferences enabled. <comment251813> it says its read only when I try ssave <comment251831> @Sup *"1. Copy the mpkg from inside the downloaded disk image onto your Desktop"* <comment254919> great answer! - what a sad bug though that the OS version is compared as string, so 10.10  10.4 :-( <comment309472> Instead of removing the code, just add a zero. 10.4.0 - 10.04.0
