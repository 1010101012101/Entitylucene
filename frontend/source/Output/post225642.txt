How to I re-download songs I've purchased but accidentally deleted? <body> I purchased an album on iTunes back in 2013. When Apple Music came out, I added the deluxe version of the album on my phone to have the extra songs, but then some songs were duplicated and would play twice in a row. I tried to remove the songs from Apple Music by swiping left and pressing delete, but instead of removing the Apple Music songs, I deleted the songs I had purchased. (Rookie mistake, I know, but this was back when the Music app had just been redesigned, and it was confusing.) Since then, I have gone into the Purchased section of my music to redownload, and the songs are just not there. Short of just buying those songs again, is there anything else I can do? Thanks!  <comment274101> If you have a Mac that has the songs on it, then you can transfer the songs via Lightning cable to your device. If not, then I'm not sure. I've had this same problem myself.
