Can I reverse the two-finger scrolling direction in OS X Lion (10.7)? <body> I just got 10.7. The two-finger scrolling direction seems wrong to me, although it says "direction - natural." I couldn't see a way to reverse it. Does anyone have a way yet?  <answer17800> Oh, found it: It's just the check-box, I thought that turned off two-finger scrolling, not the direction.  <answer17843> Uncheck the box:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yize0.png" alt="enter image description here"  I found it unnatural, too, since they flipped it. I think they're going for consistency between iPads and mice.  <answer19593> the option only available when i used magic mouse, my macbook was early 2008 model  <answer35104> I have an older Mac, and the option to change this was unchecking the first option under trackpad: "When using gestures to scroll or navigate, move content in the direction of finger movement."  Maybe this new scrolling direction is better, but for now I have two Macs, and only one on Lion, so they need to be the same.  <comment19513> I like the change. It's taking some getting used to, but I prefer the same experience between iPad and MBP when using gestures. <comment19515> I'll accept your answer as I was just being super idiotic assuming the check-box was to switch off two-finger scrolling altogether!
