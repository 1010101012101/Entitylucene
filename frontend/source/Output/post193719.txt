Vim Caught deadly signal SEGV <body> More frequent than I would like my vim crashes with the terminal prompting Vim:      Caught deadly signal SEGV.    I use vim with the pyflakes plugin to edit python scripts. The vim is the standard one that comes on the mac preinstalled.    h3Does anyone know what this problem could be caused by?/h3  I run Mac OSX 10.10.  <comment231195> I had the same issue with another plugin (vim-plug) and [the faq](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/faq#vim-caught-deadly-signal-segv) stated that it could happen if you installed vim with homebrew and ruby with RVM or rbenv but I'm not sure pyflakes needs ruby. Also have you tried [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) instead of pyflakes? Because the features of pyflakes are merged into syntastic. <comment231978> @statox Cool, maybe I will try syntactic. How should I install syntactic so that it doesn't conflict with my current vim setup? Should I just remove pyflakes so that vim is clean like when first installed? <comment232047> The simplest way to install syntastic (and most of the plug-ins actually) is to use a plug-in manager (my preference goes to [vim-plug]( https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) but that's up to you. Whatever the way you install it, it shouldn't mess with your current setup. I'm not sure removing pyflakes is mandatory but if you can disable it just to be sure it doesn't conflict with syntastic.
