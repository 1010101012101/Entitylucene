What permissions do I need to give for my server setup? <body> I am trying to have a server setup for my web app locally on my MacBook Pro. I have installed Apache, PHP successfully and checked out my web app's code to code/var/www/code location. Now there's a script in my app that writes a file in code/var/www/someDir/code. To do so I am using the following line:  precode$file = fopen($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/abc.ini", "w"); /code/pre  And on execution I see the following error in error log.  code PHP Warning:  fopen(/var/www/someDir/abc.ini): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /private/var/www/myscript.php on line 6 /code  someDir is owned by user codeabhilash.goje/code (that's me) and group codewheel/code. I have tried giving following permissions.  pre $sudo chmod -R 755 www     - Did not resolve the issue $sudo chmod -R 775 www     - Did not resolve the issue $sudo chmod -R 777 www     - Resolved the issue, but not safe. /pre  permission 777 works but I don't prefer to use this solution as it is not at all safe. Kindly let me how do I set the correct permissions to this folder.  Thanks in Advance!!  <answer55908> Apache is the process that needs to have appropriate permissions to access code/var/www/code.  Apache is typically user code_www/code of group code_www/code on MacOS.  Verify this with:  precode grep -e '^Group\|^User' /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /code/pre  Two lines should be printed.  My output looks like:  precodeUser _www Group _www /code/pre  This means that on my system, Apache processes run as user code_www/code with group code_www/code. If you're using another configuration, check the appropriate config file for the same parameters and replace code_www/code in the following solution if yours differs.  ol liChange the group of code/var/www/code with: codechgrp -R _www /var/www/code/li liChange the permissions to add group write with: codechmod -R 775 /var/www/code/li /ol  That should fix the error.   As an extra step, you can change the ownership of code/var/www/code to code_www/code and then add yourself to that group to maintain your read and write privileges.  <comment65558> Thanks @ephsmith!!! it works great...
