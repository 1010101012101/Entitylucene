Target Display Mode from a 2016 MacBook to a 2011 27" iMac <body> My Google-fu has failed me. Is it at all possible to use Target Display Mode to connect a 12-inch MacBook (early 2016) to a 27-inch iMac (Mid 2011)?  Thanks for helping.  <answer287017> It's not possible to use Target Display Mode to connect a MacBook (Early 2016) to a 27" iMac (2011)  For the Mid-2011 through Mid-2014 iMacs, you need a emThunderbolt/em cable and Thunderbolt isn't available on the Early 2016 MacBooks  From the Thunderbolt Support Page     A Mac notebook or desktop with a Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt port.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QKp39.png" alt="enter image description here"   From the MacBook (Early 2016) Tech Specs Page:  ul liUSB-C port with support for:   ul liCharging/li liUSB 3.1 Gen 1 (up to 5 Gbps)/li liNative DisplayPort 1.2 video output/li liVGA output using USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter (sold separately)/li liHDMI video output using USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (sold separately)/li /ul/li /ul  Thunderbolt is not supported on this USB-C port.
