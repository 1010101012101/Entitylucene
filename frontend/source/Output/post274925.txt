Is the command line executable "quartzfilter" gone forever in Sierra? <body> I'd like to use the pdf size reduction filters I've found, but from a script. Opening Preview and doing it manually is driving me nuts. The filters work very well, but I'd rather invoke the from the terminal.  In 2010, someone wrote a post on another size about an executable located at:  precode/System/Library/Printers/Libraries/quartzfilter /code/pre  It is no longer at that location, or at any that I can figure out (though, I don't discount that it may be hidden in a bundle). It may be renamed.  Does anyone have any idea where to find this?  I've used "find" on the command line, with sudo... still nada.   <answer274927> It is gone forever, or hidden so well that you might as well give up.  A suitable substitute can be found at the following location:  https://gist.github.com/jrk/7eb26c9a868039c70bb9  This implements a short 24-line script that you can mark executable and use with the same argument set.
