Preview randomly unable to display certain documents <body> On the MBA of a friend (10.10.3) when I double click on codePDF/code or codeJPG/code files to open them with codePreview/code, the app opens but the file does not display 90% of the time. If I press kbdSpace/kbd the document displays fine in codequicklook/code.  h3What I've done:/h3  ul liLooked on the codeConsole/code = no message on it/li liFixed permissions = no change./li /ul  I'd emlove/em to strongnot/strong re-install the system to fix the issue, is there anything I could try to open the document normally?  <comment232712> What error message do you get when double clicking on PDF and JPEG files? Is it only those that don't display correctly the majority of the time? <comment232717> @mjturner I don't get error message, it just doesn't open the file. I only tried with PDF & JPEG because that's my main use. <comment232718> &Thomas Can you try exiting Preview.app and seeing if that helps? It's odd that you don't at least get an error message. Are the files on a network drive or are they local (not that it should make a difference...)? <comment232719> @mjturner once it start bugging there is no way back, no matter how many times I close the app. The files are local and I can open its without problem on my own mac
