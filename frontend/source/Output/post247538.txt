Prevent Reply-All in Outlook <body> In Outlook 2016, I just inadvertently emreplied-all/em to an email that was meant to go to a single recipient. You guessed it; I accidentally hit emReply All/em instead instead of emReply/em. Thankfully, the content wasn't too embarrassing.   This got me thinking, there's got to be a way to prevent this... even just an alert box asking "emAre you sure you want to reply to all?/em" would be helpful. Some quick Googling around lead me nowhere. There seems to be a handful of add-ons and techniques to accomplish this on Windows, but nothing for Outlook on the Mac.   What are my options... add-ons, techniques, processes?
