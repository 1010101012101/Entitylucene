Automator to change PSD to JPG <body> I need a batch conversion tool to change PSD to JPG image files.  I have not seen a simple Automator action for this.  <answer197406> if you use Photoshop this is easy to do, under File/Automate/Batch which will allow you to pick files, set any options on quality etc that you like  <comment235798> You said, "_I have not seen a simple Automator action for this._" but have you tried creating one?  It is doable.  Did you see **Change Type of Images** under **Photos** in **Automator**?
