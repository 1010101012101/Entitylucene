Does the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter work with 2048x1152 resolution? <body> I'm thinking of buying the new Macbook Air and I was wondering whether the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter will work with my 23" Samsung LCD with a 2048 x 1152 resolution.  <answer53897> http://www.apple.com/macbookair/specs.html     Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native   resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an   external display, both at millions of colors   I don't think the adapter has any impact on what resolutions are supported.  <comment61673> BTW I just bought a third-party adapter from Monoprice.com. It works the same as the Apple adapter and is far less expensive at US$6.65 plus shipping. <comment63051> Unfortunately I think they don't ship to my country.
