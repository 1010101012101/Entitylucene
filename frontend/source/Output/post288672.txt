What can I do to fix a 'tell application "System Events"' timeout without restarting? <body> After my computer has been on for a day or two, AppleScript calls to codetell application "System Events"/code starts failing with the following error:  precodeerror "System Events got an error: AppleEvent timed out." number -1712 /code/pre  Restarting fixes whatever the underlying problem is, so presumably there is some way to simply restart whatever process is causing AppleScript to hang up.  Does anyone know what process I can try restarting to fix this?  Edit: Here's an example that will raise this error in Script Editor.app.  precodetell application "System Events"     set current_application to name of 1st process whose frontmost is true end tell /code/pre  I am on 10.12.5.  <comment364539> In what context is this System Events call being made, from a _script_ within Script Editor, an AppleScript application or an Automator _workflow_ that has a Run AppleScript _action_ and what application process is System Events talking to when it errors out?  Can you provide a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)?  If not, there might not be anything we can debug then. <comment364542> @user3439894 sorry about that, example added. <comment364554> So, are you saying that if after a day to two of uptime, you open Script Editor and run just the AppleScript _code_ show in the OP you get the error? Also, if you close Script Editor, reopen it and run the _code_ again it still errors out? If you log out instead of rebooting does it resolve the issue? What version of OS X/macOS are you running and on what modle and year Apple computer. <comment364616> Does every call fail that way or just some? <comment364931> Once it happens once, every call will fail in exactly the same way until I restart.
