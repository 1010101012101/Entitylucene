LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/darktable.app with error -10810 <body> Darktable mysteriously stopped working on me yesterday.  I tried restarting my iMac, deleting and re-installing darkable and finally after going through some forums I tried running through the terminal:     codeopen -a darktable/code br/ That returnedbr/ codeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/photo programs/darktable.app with error -10810/codebr/ I tried codechmod +x /Applications/darktable.app/Contents/MacOS/darktable/codebr/ I also tried codechmod +x '/Applications/photo programs/darktable.app/'/code  I have tried with several versions of Darktable and am beginning to think it has nothing to do with Darktable and something to do with MacOS...  Any ideas?  <answer224004> I found the solution... Here is how I found it: I tried the temporary solution suggested in this post: iTunes on iMac won&#39;t start up after upgrade (error -10699)br/ - execute the binary directly by running the binary in the terminal.  precode/Applications/darktable.app/Contents/MacOS/darktable /code/pre  That gave me this error:  precode[init] the database lock file contains a pid that seems to be alive in your system: 456 [init] database is locked, probably another process is already using it /code/pre  As stated in http://redmine.darktable.org/issues/10164, there was a lock file left behind in  /Users/{HOME_USER}/.config/darktable/library.db.lock.    strongAll I had to do was delete that file/strong and up it was running again... Sometimes it's just a little too simple. :/
