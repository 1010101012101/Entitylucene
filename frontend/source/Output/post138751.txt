ITunes is locked <body> I have installed iTunes on my Macbook-pro successfully today. But the display shows that iTunes is installed but locked and cannot be used for writing. How to unlock and use the iTunes software for recording iTunes  music on iPod   <answer138760> It's not saying that iTunes is lockedâ€”rather that the iTunes library is preventing writing to it through permissions or ACLs. Check that you have write permission to your iTunes library.  <comment163693> You installed iTunes on you Mac or Laptop? Cause iTunes comes preinstalled on Macbooks.
