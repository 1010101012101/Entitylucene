How to correctly download WWDC videos from iTunes U on Mavericks? <body> Downloading some videos for example WWDC2012 works fine, but it seems that older videos from past WWDCs cannot be downloaded.  When trying to play the older videos you get a popup telling you the "wrong version of quicktime" is present.  Running iTunes in 32-bit mode, as suggested in this almost identical question and answer, is not possible on Mavericks.  How can I download these videos on Mavericks?
