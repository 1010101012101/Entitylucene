How can I get the Alt key to work in an X11 application? <body> I'm using an editor that requires X11 and for the most part it works well. I have many commands that use the Alt key and I like to navigate the menus this way as well, but the Alt key doesn't work through X11.   I found this article on configuring the Alt key for X11 applications, but it didn't work for me. Any other ideas?  <answer13814> I think you want to check "Enable key equivalents under X11" in the Input tab of the X11 Preferences.  <comment14783> Thanks for the reply. I already have that checked (the editor vendor had me try that). <comment14807> I've found out this setting doesn't apply here. When enabled it means keystrokes like Command-N will be given to X11 (new terminal, in this case) instead of to the application itself. In my case I certainly want Alt-key to go to the application, not X11, so I have turned off "Enable key equivalents under X11".
