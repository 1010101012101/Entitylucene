Record video while playing music <body> I connect my iPhone to the AUX cable in my car and play music. This one time I wanted to video record, but when I switch to the video camera, it turns my music off.  Is there anyway to record video on iPhone 6 strongwhile/strong playing music, so that the music is in the video?  <answer179077> An app called "Jamcam" is the only way I've found to do it, might be better options out there but I don't know them, hope his helped (:  <answer198869> Check out Record and Listen. Jamcam is great, but only records videos for up to 15 seconds.   <answer224955> Snapchat does. you can only make 10 second videos but its still plays in the background your voice and whatever you're playing from your phone  <answer270632> This is the best one that i've found so far. You can play music and record unlimited. Media Monster  <comment198028> In short: without jailbreak? No. <comment273175> Thanks Whitni and welcome to S.E.
