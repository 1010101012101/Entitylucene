Alternatives to command line unzip? <body> I've found that the command line codeunzip/code tool doesn't gracefully handle some of the files I'm unzipping: it makes a bunch of junk directories, and creates files whose resource forks aren't found.  (Perhaps they were created strangely.)  precode$ unzip -d NEW-DIRECTORY ZIP /code/pre  Anyways, using codeArchive Utility/code is a start, because I can run the following and it is close (and it doesn't mess up my files):  precode$ open -a "Archive Utility" ZIP /code/pre  But this does not allow me to specify a new directory for the contents!!  It automatically puts them in the current directory. :P  What are my alternatives?  <answer3725> The Unarchiver has a beta version of their command line utility available on their downloads page.  <answer3727> you can use also:   ul liyemuzip/li /ul  and  ul listuffit-expander (not free)/li /ul  <answer3737> Springy is a very versatile unarchiver.  Shareware - and worth it to me.  <answer24275> "The Unarchiver" is a great tool, and I highly recommend it, both the GUI and the CLI tools.  That said, my codeunzip/code command is  precodeditto -xk foo.zip target_dir /code/pre  where 'target_dir' is the directory where I want the files to appear (and it can be '.' if you want them to unzip right there).   Note that 'target_dir' will be created if needed.   strongAlso note that codeditto/code does not mind overwriting files, so use with care./strong  ditto on Mac OS X is designed to preserve resource forks, etc. so it is my preferred method of unzipping files, especially because it ships with OS X by default.  <answer182002> I saw this extremely helpful answer to a problem I was having unzipping applications on another board from user patashnik:  unzip doesn't handle the embedded resourceforks in ZIP files created by the Finder. If you want to unarchive those files from the CLI, use ditto:  precodeditto -V -x -k --sequesterRsrc --rsrc FILENAME.ZIP DESTINATIONDIRECTORY /code/pre  If you want to unpack the archive in the current directory, use . as DESTINATIONDIRECTORY  <answer273894> 7z can handle some oddly zipped files code brew install p7zip 7z x weirdarchive.zip /code  <comment3584> Working well in my scripting, thank you! <comment7722> +1 for suggesting `unar` without using it's name. ;) <comment197674> Can't get this to work.
