Apple's policy on hybrid apps: >60% of native code <body> So one of our consultors recently told us that Apple rejected their hybrid app because em"It has to contain at least 60% of native code"/em, which of course is hard to accomplish if you decided to go hybrid in the first place.  I haven't been able to find anything about this anywhere. The official guidelines mention no clue about it. Does anyone know anything about this?  Thanks in advance
