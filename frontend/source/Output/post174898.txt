Is there a way to easily access the emoticons I use most in iMessage? <body> I often use the same emoticons in Messages and would like to quickly access the same set both in my iPhone, iPad, MacBook and iMac. Is there a way to achieve this?  <answer174904> When you add the Emoji-keyboard on iOS (codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboards &gt; Add New Keyboard &gt; Emoji/code), it automatically collects the recently used emoticons on the first tab at the bottom (the clock icon).  The same goes for Messages.app on OS X; when you open the Emoji-selection from the smiley-face in the input box, it shows the recent ones first.  However, on OS X you can select which emoticons are shown in the favourites, a feature currently missing on iOS. You can do this by opening the codeCharacters viewer/code from the top right corner of the Emoji-popup and selecting codeAdd to Favorites/code for the emoticons you like.  Also, there is no way to sync these usages and selections between devices, at least currently and using stock OS's.  <comment206063> could you explain what is it you are trying to do?
