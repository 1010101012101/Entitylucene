Jailbroken iPhone dead; What firmware "load" options do I have? <body> I jailbroke my original iPhone first gen to version 3.14 (I think) and since then I'm unable to use the phone.   I've done this before and never once had an issue (so I'm semi-experienced with this).  strongSymptoms/strong  ul liiTunes says the phone is in recovery mode.  /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GjIf6.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liThe screen looks like a newly loaded (not activated phone)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fTLF9.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongAttempts to fix/strong  ul liI've loaded almost every original (not jailbroken) ipsw from 3.0 to the latest one (for this model) and am not able to get back to defaults. I get the following error: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFrCX.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liI've loaded many different Jailbreak programs and none of them can make the phone work./li /ul  I'm OK if I don't ever get cellular service and just use it as an iPod Touch.  Anyone know how I can get past this screen in either jailbroken or original mode?  <answer9147> From every piece of literature I can find on the topic, and my own past experience, this normally indicates a hardware failure. Your best bet would be to take it to your nearest Apple store and they might be able to assist.  <answer9154> if I remember well, since 3.1.3 you can't reinstall firmware on jailbreaked phones with itunes. I had the same problem and 3.1.2 restore worked without problem.  needed for iphone 2g:  codeBL-39.bin/code and codeBL-46.bin/code boot loaders files  coderesdn0w-win_0.9.4/code - to jailbreak - other versions were not working with the restore file below  codeiPhone1,1_3.1.2_7D11_Restore.ipsw/code - restore file worked with itunes 10  I'm sure you can find these files easily for download.  <comment9649> Do I understand correctly: you can not use "restore device" ("... when the iphone dows not respond as ecpected ...") in iTunes? <comment9660> @Martin - When I restore (see attempts to fix) in iTunes using an original ipsw of almost any version (haven't tried em all) I get error 23 <comment9764> You can not restore with iTunes and old version of the iOS firmware. You can restore only to the latest one. There are [ways](http://www.saurik.com/id/12) to circumvent this but you should only downgrade/install an old iOS if you have a very good reason to do so. All the latest iOS versions can be [jailbroken](http://greenpois0n.com/). <comment9775> you can restore any version if you hold shift key while clicking on restore button and iTunes will ask for the file .ipsw you want to restore (previously downloaded of course). For the latest iOS, yes they can be jailbroken but at least when I did that, there were no way to restore an iOS above 3.1.2 on an already jailbroken non working iphone. <comment11028> related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1889/jailbroken-iphone-does-not-boot
