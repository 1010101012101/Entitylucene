It is possible to see the description rather than the actual email address when choosing from which mail account to send a message? <body> Using an iPhone with multiple email accounts is a bit confusing when my existing email addresses are very similar.   I use the description for each account is distinctly differentiate between the accounts, however when I try to change the sending account while composing a draft email it only shows the similar email addresses not the identifiable descriptions.  Does anyone know of a solution to modify this behavior with or without a Jailbreak?  I've been examining the provided settings on iOS for a while and google searches haven't come up with any more information on the topic.  <comment44737> This is the current function of mobile mail on iOS. The description text isn't used in the from address pulldown. Would you be looking for a jailbreak to tweak that or just confirmation that there's no easy setting to flip so iOS would substitute the description in place of the address? <comment44739> I was hoping i had simply missed a setting somewhere which would allow it to do this. If there is a tweak or a jailbreak I'd like to take a look. Thanks for the timely response.
