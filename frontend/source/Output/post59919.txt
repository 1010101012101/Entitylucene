Migration Assistant moved files to inaccesible new account, how to get to my old files? <body> I just got a Mac after many years on a PC. Migration Assistant did not work when I was setting up the computer, so I ran it a few minutes later instead.  However, it seems it transferred all my files to a different account which I cannot access. I don't know the password to that account and resetting it didn't help.  ol liWhat is the simplest way to get my old files?/li liIs there a way to merge accounts? Alternatively, If I could log in to it, I can just switch to that account. /li /ol  Update: I restarted my computer and was able to login to the other account. Now I'll delete the default account.   <comment68968> Resetting passwords with admin access should have worked... I've been able to do that with multiple accounts on my MBP. <comment68981> I was now able to get in to it, so I'll go delete first account. <comment68984> Excellent! Make sure that you still have at least one account with admin access - you'll need it to be able to install apps & change your system config.
