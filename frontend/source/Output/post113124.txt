iMac 2009 works slow <body> iMac (model 2009, purchased in late 2012) sometimes becomes extremely slow. I've opened the "System monitor" and discovered that there is a huge lack of RAM.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9p25m.png" alt="enter image description here"  But as you can see there is no app occupying all the memory (except the kernel_task, i've got no idea what it is). The 2nd pic show that CPU is alright.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uqMSf.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried to make "sudo purge" and it helps a little, but a few minutes later lags come back. I don't want just to get more memory, coz I don't understand why 4 GB isn't enough when the largest app - Photoshop - uses only 179 MB. If you got any idea what can be the reason you're welcome.  p.s. Sorry for the pictures are on Russian, but I'm sure it won't be a big trouble). If necessary, i can give any screenshots.   <answer113132> The memory pressure (yellow part at the bottom of the first screenshot) so I recommend upping your ram to at least 8 gigs of RAM (or even 16 if you can afford it). To see what kind of RAM you need, see HT1423 .  <comment132828> The question is not "How much?" but "why?". I can't find the reason of memory compression.
