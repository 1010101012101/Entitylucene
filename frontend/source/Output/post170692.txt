How many files are on my HFS drive? <body> Is there a quick and easy way to tell about how many files I have on a given HFS+ formatted hard drive?  On Unix, I use codedf -i/code, but HFS+ apparently doesn't use inodes and returns a silly answer based on the percentage of disk space I'm using:  precode# df -i /Volumes/BARRY  Filesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity   iused     ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1s2   4.0T   2.7T   1.3T    68% 660707979 315962685   68%   /Volumes/BARRY /code/pre  Of course, I can codefind /Volumes/BARRY | wc/code or something, but does HFS+ keep track of how many files are on a given filesystem?  <comment200760> Are you only talking about command lines in Terminal? If not, use Disk Utility is easy. <comment200762> Brilliant, I should've thought of that. Make it an answer and I'll accept it. Just out of curiosity, is there a command-line way to do it? HFS+ obviously stores this information somewhere. <comment200763> "diskutil info" does not provide this information, oddly enough.
