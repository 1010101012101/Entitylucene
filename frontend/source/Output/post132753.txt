Disk Utility Crashed whilst creating a Partition and I'm now missing hard drive space <body> Disk Utility Crashed whilst creating a Partition, and I now have ~100GB missing, which was the amount I had allocated to the new partition. The new partition didn't get created, and I now have 100GB missing from the Hard drive. I have a 1TB hard drive, and when I go to Disk Utility, it says:  Capacity : 999.35 GB (999,345,127,424 Bytes)br Available : 586.1 GB (586,103,844,864 Bytes)br Used : 310.52 GB (310,524,317,696 Bytes)  Which adds up to about ~900GB. I used terminal to look using codediskutil list/code  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  I tried Repairing Disk in Disk Utility, and as suggested on another thread, booting into Recovery Mode and Repairing Disk there, but neither made a difference. Am I missing 100 GB on my disk?  <comment157206> It sounds like the partition is there but you need a partition map to see it; this would entail the use of partition mapping software. <comment157207> why wouldn't disk utility show the partition? also, do you know of any software I could use (preferable free)? <comment157208> If you open terminal - what does `diskutil list` show for the information on the actual internal drive (which is almost always /dev/disk0 if you have more than one disk mounted) <comment157212> @bmike it says: /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
