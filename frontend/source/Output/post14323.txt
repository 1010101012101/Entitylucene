How do I uninstall imagemagick from Mac OS X? <body> I have ImageMagick installed on my Mac. I manually installed it and the dependencies.  However, it is causing some problems with brew doctor, so I would like to just uninstall it. After uninstalling it, I will:  precodebrew install imagemagick /code/pre  I am not sure how to uninstall it, so any help getting me started in the right direction would be great!  hr  I have decided to abandon this for now. I will be leaving it as is, and using homebrew to install it when I upgrade to Lion. Thanks.  <answer14325> Please try codebrew remove imagemagick/code  Sorry my bad ;) If you manually installed it, goto the root directory where you downloaded the sourcecode and try codesudo make uninstall/code. If you already deleted the install files, redownload the source file and untar it. Then you can codecd/code to the source dir. and use codesudo make uninstall/code to uninstall.  <answer22431> Homebrew can show you which files in /usr/local aren't under it's control: codebrew list --unbrewed/code  This list should be a good start for cleaning up, or if you just want to focus on stuff that may interfere with homebrew: codebrew list --unbrewed | egrep '^(lib|include)'/code  <comment15415> It would imagine `brew uninstall imagemagick`... <comment15421> I think what he's saying is that he did not install it with homebrew, but he wishes to do so. In which case this does not answer his question. <comment15422> This question is unanswerable, as we don't know how or where you installed ImageMagickâ€¦ You should check the documentation of your install package.
