Podcasts playing too fast even when speed is set to 1x <body> The playback speed is set to 1x and it's still playing too fast. I have an iPhone 6s and iOS 10.3.2. It had been fine for two years up until a week ago. Why does it do this? And what is the solution?  <comment367558> Please post a screenshot of the Podcast player and be sure to include the playback speed.  Also, does this happen for every podcast you play or only a specific podcast?
