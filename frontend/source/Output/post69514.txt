How do I find the IP addresses assigned to devices connected via Internet Sharing on Snow Leopard? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Show Active Connections to “Internet Sharing”       Using the following scenario as an example:  I have a Macbook Pro connected to my LAN via its Airport. I enabled Internet Sharing so that the Airport connection would be shared among any devices connected to the ethernet port of the MBP. I plug a Raspberry Pi into the ethernet port of my MBP and boot it up.  How do I determine its IP address so I know what to SSH into?  <answer69515> Try pinging the broadcast address. This should work as long as the Pi got an IP from DHCP and responds to ping.  First, open up a terminal and run codeifconfig en0/code. This should give you the info for your ethernet interface, if not, just use codeifconfig/code and find it yourself. Make a note of the broadcast address. In my case, it's 192.168.2.255:  precodeinet 192.168.2.99 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255 /code/pre  So I'll run the command codeping 192.168.2.255/code. Do the same with your broadcast address, and hit CTRL-C to stop the ping once you have some results:  precodeMiramar:~ gabriel$ ping 192.168.2.255 PING 192.168.2.255 (192.168.2.255): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 192.168.2.99: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.113 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=3.567 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.2.99: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.096 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=3.455 ms ^C /code/pre  The broadcast is intended to go out to everything on the network. Everything that hears it should respond. In my case, I only see my IP and my router's - I guess it didn't bother passing the request on to my other machines, but you're directly connected to the Pi so you should see it there.
