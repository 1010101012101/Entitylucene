How to stream from iTunes(on iMac) to iphone/ipad on same network, at the same time? <body> I can use the Remote app to control what is currently playing on the iMac, but is there a way to stream the audio so that it is playing out through the iMac AND the ipad/phone in parallel?  <answer83382> Home sharing will let you access and play your Mac's music library from your iPad. However, there's no provision for synchronously playing the same track on the Mac and the iPad.   <answer83413> Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil can stream to multiple computers and iOS devices (using a free iOS app). It can stream from iTunes, or from many other applications.  <answer85160> Yeah, just use home sharing, here you could get the tips: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4557  <answer269763> Go for Home Sharing.

But this is not what the user is asking for, he asks for the music the be played **simultaneously** on the iMac and the iPhone/iPad. <comment121468> Please explain the downvotes so I can either delete or modify the question <comment338901> This adds nothing that hasn't already been said, yet in even less detail.
