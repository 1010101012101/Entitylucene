iPod Nano Running Playlist - Does it always have to start from the first song? <body> I have the latest iPod Nano and I use it when I run. I have created several playlists for that purpose and sync'ed them to my Nano. Some of the playlists are 70-90 minutes long.  However, the Nano won't let me start a playlist from a song different than the 1st song or let me shuffle songs within a playlist.  So, for example, I want to run on a specific music album which is 70 minutes long and I always have to listed to the songs from the first 45 minutes of the album (because I run for 45 minute sessions).  Is there a way around this?  Regards,
