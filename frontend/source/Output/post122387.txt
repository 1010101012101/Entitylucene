Taskbar Icon for New Mail <body> I'm running Mac OS X 10.9.1 using the Mail app (v7.1) to interact with my exchange email account.   Is there any way to configure the Mail app to show an icon in the task bar whenever I have new mail?   I have the pop up notifications and the red number in my hidden dock and alt-tab screens, however, I would really like to just have a non-intrusive little black mail icon on the task bar when I have unread mail. This is default on Windows with Outlook, I just haven't found any Mac apps that will replicate it yet.   Any ideas, suggestions, tips?  <answer122390> This is currently not possible solely with OS X and Mail.  However, third-party apps such as strongMail Unread Menu/strong can add an icon to the menu bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgAqF.png" width="200"  <comment162789> This does no longer work in Mavericks.
