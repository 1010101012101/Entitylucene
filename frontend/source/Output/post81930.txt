Compiling (NS/Cocoa) Emacs on OSX with SVG support <body> Can anyone explain how to build Emacs code--with-ns/code and SVG support on OS X?   Notes:   ul licode--with-rsvg/code isn't working (when librsvg is installed, ie. via Homebrew) /li liFYI, The Emacs Mac port uses webkit to provide SVG support, although that build adds far too many things I don't want./li /ul  I want to just compile in support for SVG on Cocoa Emacs, I'm not averse to patching, and if no answers are available, I'll see if I can patch over from the Emacs Mac port  em(Assume latest stable version of Emacs 24.2, building from source)/em  h3Update:/h3  I've tried running codebrew install emacs --cocoa --svg/code without success.   <answer86901> I was unable to get this working, and instead went with the Emacs Mac Port  Turns out it's much better than I'd thought.  <answer157144> The installation of the Emacs latest version (25.0.50) works fine using this command:  precodebrew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head --cocoa --with-gnutls --with-rsvg --with-imagemagick /code/pre  <comment94462> I'm sorry, perhaps this question is off topic here (see FAQ).

Still, now I'm hooked on Emacs Mac Port's pixel scrolling.  I'll give it a go anyway. Thank you. <comment184910> Yes, thatâ€™s the only downside. On the other hand I often had the problem that pixel-wise scrolling was sluggish. Line-wise scrolling is on the other hand a little bit too sensitive, but I also got used to it pretty quickly- <comment185171> I tried building, however I got `ranlib: file: libgnu.a((u64|unistd).o) has no symbols` errors. <comment185175> Try `brew update`, then `brew upgrade` (might take a while) and finally the Emacs install command above. If it still does not work, try running `brew doctor` and see if there is something broken. <comment185177> Tried all those already unfortunately.  Only Quartz is out of date, I will update it and try again. <comment185417> installed fine on a couple of machines without any intervention (std. step of `brew update` of course) - wish I knew why that other machine's config is out of whack. <comment185959> reboot fixed the errant machine... ;) <comment185963> "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" <comment185965> Too busy modeling sea parks http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4364/15/16x9/800.jpg
