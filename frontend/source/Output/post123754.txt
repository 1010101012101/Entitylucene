iCloud, account limit reached <body> I have a problem with iCloud!  One years ago I lost two Apple IDs, one of them signed to iCloud. I don't remember have any added iCloud account!  Today I made a new Apple ID and wanted to sign up for iCloud. When I type my Apple ID details on Mavericks to codeSystem Preferences &gt; iCloud/code, I see an error that says     Account Limit Reached.      This device is no longer eligible for creating iCloud account.   I want to know how can I use other devices (My girlfriend's iPad or MacBook Air) to create new iCloud with my new Apple ID and use this on my current MacBook Pro?  I have an standard user account @Mavericks on my girlfriend's MacBook Air.  I changed personal informations on my old Apple ID. So, my old iCloud email(s) is a security risk that's located on Apple servers - for me?  <comment144586> How did you lose two Apple IDs?
