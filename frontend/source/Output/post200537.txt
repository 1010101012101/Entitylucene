Restoring from IPSW. Unable to connect to gs.apple.com (error 3014) <body> I had been running jailbroken ios7 on my iPad for a long time. Last month I  decided to update to 8.4 Downloading the update from itunes failed a few times so I grabbed the file from apple servers myself  When I tried to restore using the ipsw file, itunes gave me code3014/code error. I tried again next day, same error.  I'm running windows 10 x64 and I have:  ul liMade sure my HOSTS file is not causing it. There is definitely nothing apple related in there./li liChecked my firewall rules, disabled the firewall. That did not help either/li liperformed restore process multiple times with no luck/li liTried pinging codegs.apple.com/code from another computer with windows 7.. it times out just the same/li /ul  Its been more than a month now and my iPad is just sitting there...   Itunes network dianosis shows me this -  precodeFirewall Information  Windows Firewall is off.  Connection attempt to Apple web site was successful. Connection attempt to browsing iTunes Store was successful. Connection attempt to purchasing from iTunes Store was successful. Connection attempt to iPhone activation server was successful. Connection attempt to firmware update server was unsuccessful. The network connection timed out. Connection attempt to Gracenote server was successful. Last successful iTunes Store access was 2015-08-16 13:05:38. /code/pre  h2---------------/h2  The server I cannot connect to is codegs.apple.com/code. I believe that's what causing itunes to throw the error (3014)  Tried pinging it, failed -  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfEUm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Suprisingly, however, I can access it from the browser (why/how?)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PIfN5.png" alt="enter image description here"  My iPhone can recieve updates just fine over the same network. I'm stumped, can someone help me out, am i missing something?  If there's a way to update without the itunes server-check I'd love to hear it. Methods involving jailbreak are welcome  <answer201906> Enter DFU Mode, and strongthen/strong try a restore. Method:  First, plug the iPad into your computer, and then power it off. Make sure iTunes is running on your PC.  Now empress and hold/em both the Power button and Home button simultaneously, until you see the Apple logo. Now let go of the Power button while still holding down the Home button. iTunes can now associate with the device and is told that the iPad is in Recovery Mode.  Finally, simply Restore your iPad to the ipsw file that you downloaded (or just restore, whatever your choice is).  strongJust in case/strong you didn't know, in order to restore an iOS device to a certain backup/ipsw file located on your emWindows computer/em, shift-click the strongRestore iPad/strong ( / iPhone / iPod) button in iTunes and find &amp; pick the file manually.  (Note: There is a tool I know of called Cydia Impactor. There's actually a desktop version of it as well. Unfortunately, however, it apparently only works with iOS 8.3 and 8.4 in the jailbreak version of the tool.)  <answer202703> The problem is with your host file that is causing problem connecting with gs.apple.com.   This post will help you fix your host file.   http://www.yourtechinfo.com/2015/08/top-3-ways-to-fix-itunes-error-3014.html  <answer202720> Fix Date/Time &amp; update iTunes:  First method is easiest of all three. You have to check for date and time on your computer whether it is correct or not? Many people were getting this error because date and time on their computer was incorrect and they got this error fixed after correcting the date and time. It is also advisable to update iTunes to latest version of iTunes. You can check for updates by by opening iTunes and then clicking on “check for updates”. If any updates are available iTunes will inform you about those updates and you can install those updates.  Turn off Antivirus:  Sometimes the antivirus program installed on your computer may conflict with the host file of your computer which results in iTunes error 3014. So if you turn off your antivirus for sometime and then try to restore through iTunes you won’t get error 3014.  Fix Host File:  This is the most effective method of all three. In this method you are basically fixing the host file of your computer. Follow these steps to fix the host file on your computer.  ol liTo access the host file on your computer you have to go to  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc/li liDelete the HOSTS file found in this directory. (you will need administrator access for deleting the hosts file.)/li liDownload Hosts file from the bottom of this post and copy the downloaded hosts file in the same directory. (you will need administrator access for copying the hosts file.)/li liOnce host file is copied in the above directory restart your computer and start restoring your device through iTunes./li /ol  <answer242991> go to C:Windows/System32/Drivers/Etc  and open the hosts file in notepad  and at the botton of the text file add this:  74.208.105.171 gs.apple.com  (Numer Symbol)74.208.10.249 GS.APPLE.COM  (Numer Symbol)127.0.0.1 GS.APPLE.COM  (Numer Symbol)74.208.105.171 GS.APPLE.COM  then Save! (You may save it on the desktop and then replace it with the old one)  <comment241907> Check this below troubleshooting guide; https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204770#error3014 <comment241952> Like I stated in my question, I've tried the methods written in Official apple support docs <comment243393> `ping` uses ICMP (over IP) which is a completely separate protocol from TCP (over IP), used by http, which is why there's nothing unusual about the fact that you cannot ping `gs.apple.com` but can access  over it http using a browser. I'm afraid I cannot help with the Jailbreaking issues, but I think your inability to ping isn't the cause. I can't ping `gs.apple.com` either. <comment243404> Friend had this problem too. Tried from another pc and worked <comment243405> Also make sure that you have latest version of iTunes <comment243406> Hope it helps you <comment243549> Where is the GS error logged? Can you upload the file to github gist and link here if it's too long to embed? What version of iTunes? What Windows version? <comment244523> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
