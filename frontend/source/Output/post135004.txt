Anadis-MacBook-Pro:github anadi$  /code/pre  <comment159991> What does `brew doctor` says? <comment162536> added output, nothing about the php55 formula. <comment162626> Well, there *is* no package available for php55 with brew. What does your various .profile/.bash_profile/.bash_rc contains? Is there something in there that somehow tries to run `brew install php55`? <comment162874> yes there was an `export` statement pointing to that formula in `.bash_profile` removing it fixed the problem
