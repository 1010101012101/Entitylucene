Can I dual boot with Windows on my seconday hard drive? <body> Recently I've added a 250GB SSD into my Macbook Pro (Mid 2012) and put my larger standard 1TB drive where my CD drive used to be. I'm wanting to dual boot with Windows 10 using BootCamp but I'm running into big problems.  The first issue was that I cannot install on it because its part of a GPT scheme or something. That I resolved, sort of, using gdisk. Now it's saying that my BIOS controller won't allow me to install Windows on that partition. I came across an article saying that BootCamp will only allow you to boot from a primary drive.  I feel that it's not the best method to install both onto my small SSD and then split my larger drive into two 500GB partitions for storage. Is this the only method that works?  Has anybody else been successful installing Windows onto a secondary drive?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <comment328889> You need to reformat that HD in a GUID partition scheme in order to install windows. <comment328890> I tried. I used disk utility to format using GUID and then splitting into the two partitions, NOT using BootCamp and still no luck. <comment328897> GPT is the GUID Partition Table. If it's formatted GPT, that should work fine... <comment328898> It's complaining about GPT.. but even once that's fixed. It won't let me install because it says my BIOS controller won't allow it. <comment328902> Macs don't use BIOS. Is this the Windows installer that's complaining about this? <comment328903> Yes. When creating the partitions, or even after the partitions are created with the correct schemes the final error is about the bios.
