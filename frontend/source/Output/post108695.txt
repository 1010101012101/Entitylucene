Mac as wi-fi hotspot: how many devices can connect? <body> Is there a theoretical or practical limit to the number of devices that can be connected to a Macbook Pro sharing its internet connection as a wi-fi hotspot?  <answer108702> It can connect at max 7 devices, I have tried to connect more but wasn't able to.  <answer134475> I don't know about limit but I'm using 5 devices (3 mobiles and 1 macbook air and 1 windows 8 laptop) without any issue. data transfer ratio is also good.   <answer182909> On OSX Yosemite (beta 10.10.3), on MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012), today (2015-04-28), I've connected 15 different devices (Android, iOS, Win, OSX) via WiFi hotspot (sharing internet via Ethernet), and reported very low decline in internet bandwith with each new device connected.  <answer278440> I regularly try connecting 27 Wi-Fi modules (ESP-12F) and find that typically around three or four don't connect. It's slightly different every time, so the limit is probably 24.  In my case I'm using a Mac Mini 2009 model to share the internet.  <comment153544> At least as of today, May 15, 2014 and OS X Mavericks I have connected around 15 Android tablets to my MBP. Personally, I don't know what the limit is. <comment153774> My data was based on the MBP Early 2011 model.
