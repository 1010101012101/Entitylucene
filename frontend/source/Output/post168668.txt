Can I use a Verizon iPad 3rd Generation WiFi Only? <body> I am considering purchasing a used iPad 3rd generation 8.9 size.  This iPad is advertised as a used 64gb Verizon iPad.  I only want to use the iPad on wifi and do not want to connect to Verizon or AT&amp;T.  Can I do this or do I have to go through Verizon to get it to work. I have never had an iPad and I am 67 years of age so I am not familiar with what I need to look for or be careful about in buying a used iPad.    <answer168671> Yes, you can use it without activating the cellular radio.   <answer168672> Yes, you will be able to use the iPad without a Verizon SIM card through your WiFi network. However, it appears that there is a problem where the iPad keeps notifying you that there is no SIM card.  I would advise getting one without cellular data as you don't plan on using it anyway. Those iPads are probably cheaper and will not have the previously described problem.  <comment198041> Thanks so much for your suggestion.  I appreciate your help!
