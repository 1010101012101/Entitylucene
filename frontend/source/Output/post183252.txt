how to move contacts en mass from one iCloud account to another <body> I need to have two iCloud accounts, one for work and one for play/personal. Is there an easy way to move all contacts from one iCloud account to another via iCloud.com. For example, if I have 400 contacts in my personal iCloud account and none in my work iCloud account, how would I lift them from the personal account to the work account?  <answer183255> From Mac Contacts..  File menu  Export  Contacts Archive  then  File Menu  Import  hr  Or from iCloudâ€¦  Prefs 'cog'br Select Allbr Export vCard - which will save a 'batch' vCard to your default DL location [then, irritatingly, immediately try to import it to your Mac Contacts list, so hit Cancel]  Swap iCloud accounts, then import vCard  <comment218396> And how about from iCloud.com? <comment218400> added iCloud method
