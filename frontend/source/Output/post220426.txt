Performance problems, possibly malware? <body> I have concerns about malware or something significantly affecting the performance of my iMac.  As you can see from the screen shot below I have updated to strongemOS X Yosemite Version 10.10.5/em/strong, but I did this after I started to have problems in the hope that any new security updates would help.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HNME4.png" alt="enter image description here"  Additionally, I have installed strongemAvast Mac Security/em/strong and it hasn't identified anything.  Among my performance problems:  ul liApplications can open very slowly./li liTyping often has a very long lag before the letters or words appear on the screen./li liSearches using strongemSpotlight/em/strong take ages./li liSearches in strongemMail/em/strong (which uses strongemSpotlight/em/strong?) take ages./li liClicking through folders in strongemFinder/em/strong can take ages for files to appear./li /ul  Very frustrating all of this.  I did have one of those strongemMacKeeper/em/strong things that locked up strongemSafari/em/strong one day but I've pretty thoroughly looked for evidence of it and can't find any.  Still, in the screenshot of my strongemActivity Monitor/em/strong below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r1xrm.png" alt="enter image description here"  I consistently see the process, strongemmds/em/strong, seeming to command a ridiculous amount of CPU time.  This doesn't seem normal to me.  I have additionally, cleared strongemSpotlight/em/strong's index by adding strongemMacintosh HD/em/strong to the strongemPrivacy/em/strong list them removing it.  I have further put just about every folder into the strongemPrivacy/em/strong list except for strongemDocuments/em/strong and Mail &amp; Messages.  In strongemSpotlight/em/strong's emSearch Results/em, I have unchecked everything except:   ul liDocuments/li liFolders/li liMail &amp; Messages/li liContacts/li liBookmarks &amp; History/li /ul  and I still have all of this strongemmds/em/strong activity?  One more additional symptom, that has me concerned.  Some of my saved strongemSafari/em/strong information, like logins to innocent websites have disappeared.  Not certain if this followed the strongemMacKeeper/em/strong yuck or after the update to strongemOS X Yosemite Version 10.10.5/em/strong.  Also, I do have strongemTime Machine/em/strong running.  Not certain if the strongemmds/em/strong stuff has anything to do with it, but I even turned of strongemTime Machine/em/strong and I still saw all that strongemmds/em/strong activity.  Any suggestions about how to solve this problem or even how to analyze it much appreciated.  <answer220428> Well, for starters, clearing Spotlight's index will make mds have to work all the harder to refill it.  If you've ever had MacKeeper on there, you need to get hold of Malwarebytes to get rid of the leftovers.  Avast, in itself, will slow down your machine. I tried it once, got rid of it within a week.  I'd also be tempted to say updating to El Capitan might fix some of it. I found Yosemite was getting pretty laggy towards the end. I even posted on here about one aspect of it - Typing lag on SE sites - Safari  <comment266769> Roughly what files are shown by `sudo fs_usage -f filesys | grep mds`? This command shows what files mds (and related processes) are accessing, which should show which files are currently being indexed (mds is Spotlight indexing). Malware is extremely unlikely. <comment266770> But, I cleared the Spotlight index over a week ago.  Shouldn't that give it plenty of time?  I'll check out the rest of your suggestions.  Thanks. <comment266780> Well, Malwarebytes found something called Spigot and removed it, but I still seem to have the problems.  I've also uninstalled Avast.  El Capitan seems like the next step... I'll keep you posted <comment266785> @grgarside -- Running the command shows lots and lots of things, (and it keeps running) ,but what does this mean?  What should I look for?  What can this output tell me? <comment266786> Press ‚åÉC to stop the command so you can read it. There will be paths which should give you an idea of what it is indexing. For example, paths to files on your Time Machine drive shows that it is indexing Time Machine. <comment266811> Update to El Capitan seems to have helped and may have solved the entire issue.  You've got my vote for now.  -- Thanks.
