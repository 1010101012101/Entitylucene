Virus in Safari preventing it from launching? <body> I think I got a virus in Safari because I was downloading an app and now Safari will not open. It keeps asking to reopen the last windows closed when opening and whether I click yes or no it doesn't matter. It then crashes and shows a "send a report or ignore" option because Safari will not open.   I already tried restarting my computer and updating Safari. There was a post somewhere else that said something about putting a "com.apple.safari..." item on my desktop out of the Library/Preferences folder, but I do not have that. Must be because of the new update or something.   precodeREPORT: Crashed Thread: 16 Exception Type: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000020 External Modification Warnings: Thread creation by external task. /code/pre  Please help me.   <answer164362> The folder you mentioned is code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Safari.savedState/code  You can find it like this…  ul liSwitch to the Finder &amp; hit kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbdN/kbd to generate a new window./li liHit kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbd⇧ Shift/kbd-kbdG/kbd for Go To…/li liCopy/paste the following [including the tilde ~ sign]  code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Safari.savedState/code/li liClick Go/li liDelete the entire contents of that folder; it should be just a few files called codedata.data/code, codewindow_1.data/code and codewindows.plist/code/li /ul  Try launching Safari again.  <answer166537> You might be victim of Genieo/InstallMac malware.

I hope it helps!  <answer263801> Start in Safe Mode (holding the Shift key), does Safari open? Then restart normally.  <comment192685> I did exactly that and it did not help. I still got this:   Safari quit unexpectedly.Click Reopen to open the application again. Click Report to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple.  This is the beginning of the report if that helps:  Crashed Thread:        16  Exception Type:        EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes:       KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000020  External Modification Warnings: Thread creation by external task. <comment192688> REPORT:  Crashed Thread:        16  Exception Type:        EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes:       KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000020  External Modification Warnings: Thread creation by external task. <comment192691> hmm… then I'm not sure - try going to ~/Library/Safari by the same method. first select all, right click & 'Compress xx Items' so you have a safety-net. Empty the folder [retaining the .zip, of course], try again. <comment192694> Could you disclose what app were you downloading? <comment192695> sorry for negative vote, but the OP clearly says your answer did not work. <comment192696> Or if you could publish the whole report on a Dropbox or similar. First line does not help diagnosing the problem. <comment192697> @Buscar웃 last I looked, we were still working on it. -1 would indicate the solution had no hope of working or was simply bad advice, not that it could be tried as a first step. <comment192699> As it stands right now your answer did not resolve the issue, so lets see what is to come, and to reverse the Vote. I usually delete my incorrect answer, and come up with a modified version, otherwise as it stands it is misleading to others with same problem. At least I am talking to you, and not just giving a anonymous negative Votes (common practice here :( <comment192701> @Buscar웃 if I delete the answer right now then we have no flow of Q/A to reach a solution, only the crash report added to the original question. As SE doesn't timeline particularly well, the intermediate solution is to leave things as they are until more info is gathered. <comment192706> If you think you got a Virus try the ClamXav scanner. <comment330583> There are too many irrelevant answers, so here you go...(CMD+S) Boot Single-User then **fsck -fy** the issue you are experiencing is pertaining to a data leak.
