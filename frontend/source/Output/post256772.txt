OSX Terminal Window Freezes Periodically <body> I have recently started to experience a symptom whereby my Terminal process starts to consume ~ 99% CPU.  Note: It is the Terminal process (not any child process) that is consuming the CPU.  The Terminal remains in this state for 60-90 seconds, then resumes normal operation (at 0% CPU).  I think I see the problem most often after returning to my Mac after I have been away awhile and then attempt to interact with one of the tabs of a Terminal window in some fashion.  Can anyone explain why this might be occurring? I have been using OSX since 2013 and have never seen this happen before.  (I am running El Capitan 10.11.6) on an 8GB 2015 Macbook Air.
