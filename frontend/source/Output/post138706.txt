How to automatically tag file by name or extension <body> I was wondering if there is a way to automatically tag a file as it reaches your computer, like downloads, copying from an external drive, etc. I would like to simulate gmail filters, like labelling every email as it reaches your mail.  I would prefer if we could do this by name, but if it could be done by extension, that would be ok too.  <answer138709> Apple offer Folder Actions to attach AppleScripts to folders. You can attach an AppleScript to perform any task with incoming files to a specific folder.  See Folder Actions Tutorial: Automation, Meet the Filesystem for a tutorial and step-by-step guide.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvLuI.png" alt="enter image description here"
