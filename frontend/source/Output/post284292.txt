Initiate actions in Sublime Text from outside <body> I am in Terminal running my Ruby script, that outputs stuff like  precodeyou might be interested in id e843f7d53a5f9768f518cb371e6c5f07 /code/pre  so I select that id using a "mouse", cmd+E, cmd+tab to Sublime (cmd+P to file if needed) and then cmd+G to find that substring.  I would like to teach my program to communicate with Sublime Text 3 telling it to "search for ... in ... and select it when you find it". Should it be done somehow via Automator, osascript or Sublime has such API that I need?  <comment358517> @user3439894, cmd+E and cmd+G work like in any text viewer-editor on Mac OS. Try to select any little word on this webpage in your browser and then press cmd+E, cmd+G, cmd+G.
