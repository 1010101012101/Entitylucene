I selected "manually release this version" - what next? <body> I submitted an app to itunes connect. As I remember, I selected the aforementioned field instead of the other one with automatic release. Now my app status is ready to sale, what should I do next? Where should I "manually release" it? I can't see such option in itunes connect.  Thanks in advance  <comment205615> Oh, I guess this is all about setting date of release right? There's no such button "release" or something? <comment205621> You may want to move this to SO.
