Silencing the Memory slot utility <body> I recently upgraded my Mac Pro with 24Gb of ram, quite the nice feeling.  When I booted up the system again, I got this message :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mNHq6.png" alt="Memory utility"  Quite nice I thought, seems the memory is working as it should. And apparently, it is.  But now, every time I reboot my computer, Memory Slot Utility feels the need to tell me this again. Ive been trying to find a setting or app for this Memory Slot Utility, but with no luck.  Does anyone know how to silence this on start alert forever ?  <answer37835> You can turn it off by logging in once as the root user. Root's disabled by default, but here's how to enable it and log in as root:  Steps taken from here: http://www.dreness.com/blog/?p=231  hr  ol liIn Finder, choose Go – Go to Folder...
