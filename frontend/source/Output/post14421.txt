How do I run terminal in sudo mode? <body> I was trying to install npm, and I got  precodenpm ERR! Error: EACCES, Permission denied '/usr/local/lib/node_modules' npm ERR!  npm ERR! Please use 'sudo' or log in as root to run this command. npm ERR!  npm ERR!     sudo npm "install" "." "--force" "--global" npm ERR!  npm ERR! or set the 'unsafe-perm' config var to true. npm ERR!  npm ERR!     npm config set unsafe-perm true /code/pre  How can log in as a root?  <answer14422> You need to use the codesu/code (switch user) command to become root, but only root is allowed to become root, so you need to use codesudo/code (super-user do). Therefore, type: codesudo su/code.  precode[william@NCC-1701 ~]$ sudo su Password: [root@NCC-1701 /Users/william]$  /code/pre  If you haven't used root before, you should be made fully aware that one wrong character typed as root will delete your entire operating system, including your photos, emails and financial documents. Be extremely careful and always triple-read what you type before hitting enter. Otherwise, good luck!  <answer14423> codesudo -s/code is far easier than enabling the root user since it just starts up a shell with root permissions as a one step, on demand action. Not only is it fast, but it doesn't need to be reconfigured when you don't need the root user and doesn't expose the server to any more risk or vulnerability that adding a root user would entail.  Of course for codenpm/code you could just follow the directions and type:  precodesudo -H npm "install" "." "--force" "--global" /code/pre  That still makes the codenpm/code command "root" and skips the log out step to get back out of root.  <answer14424> I usually do it bit differently than how others described here. Lets imagine you have two users. standard user: john admin user: kevin  If john is logged in and wants to run as a root user(as kevin) here is how I do it.  precodesu kevin /code/pre  when asked enter kevin's password  precodesudo npm "install" "." "--force" "--global" /code/pre  enter kevin's password again.  <comment15551> been an AIX support technician for 3 years ... 12 years ago :) know some stuff but the simple stuff had vanished from my head :) <comment15553> I was going to snark my answer with friendly manual and google suggestions but quickly deleted it after reading your bio. Welcome to mac. I still can't bring myself to type vm_stat after years of AIX. Gotta love shell aliases ;-) <comment17691> But better to sudo the one command rather than run under a shell as root <comment42125> After you've already switched user to kevin, why do you need the `sudo`? <comment54823> Why use `sudo su` instead of `sudo -s`? <comment54824> Do not login as root. ;-) <comment114619> Could you explain what `sudo -s` does in this context? <comment114623> @KatieK The command `sudo -s` runs a shell as root. The [manual page](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/sudo.8.html) has these details and much more. I will add some words since your question is a good one and many others might also wonder what it does. <comment114636> @bmike - That's exactly what I needed - thanks! <comment130633> All I see is NCC-1701 lol
