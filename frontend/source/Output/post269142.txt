How to find out why ports for Apple Services (iMessage) are closed and open them! Thanks! <body> On macOS, the ports for iMessage, Facetime are not allowing the apps to authenticate with Apple. The error reads that there is a problem authenticating.   What's odd is that when I use Network Utility to scan, only port 631 is open but port 80 and 5223 work here: http://portquiz.net/  but not port 443.  According to Apple, ports 80, 443, and 5223 are needed for iMessage/Facetime.   According to Apple these ports are listed here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202078  Been on the phone with Apple engineers for weeks --- they are slow and seemingly stumped. We tried some pf file stuff sort of. Any ideas?
