Large preferences (plist) files <body> Browsing through my recent Yosemite backup I noticed that two of the largest files were codecom.apple.sidebarlists.plist/code (78 MB) and codecom.apple.recentitems.plist/code (10 MB). Both files are located in code~/Library/Preferences/code.  Investigating codecom.apple.sidebarlists.plist/code yields that the following key holds a huge amount of data under the key: codesystemitems/code  codeVolumesList/code  codeBookmark/code  codedata/code  Is it normal for plist files to become so large? What kind of data is this (icon previews?) and why are the files so large?  <answer188800> Property List (codeplist/code) files can grow to large sizes. Ten megabytes is large for preferences but not extreme.  h3Reasonable Size/h3  Apple's developer documentation mentions that preferences sync'd with iCloud have an upper limit of 1 MB:     The total amount of space available in your appâ€™s key-value store, for a given user, is 1 MB. There is a per-key value size limit of 1 MB, and a maximum of 1024 keys.   h3Bookmarks/h3  The sidebar lists and recent items content you mention are bookmarks. Bookmarks are encoded blobs of data used by OS X to locate a specific file or folder. A bookmark frequently contains more information than just a path; information such as security rights and means to locate the original file should it move or be renamed.  <comment223555> Thanks - so would you say my 78 MB plist file is dorked somehow? <comment223589> 78 MB is large but not huge in a world where Macs have 4+ GiB of RAM. If you want to reclaim the space, delete the file, log out and log back in. You will loose your Finder's customised sidebar selection.
