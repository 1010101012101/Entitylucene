⌘+↑/↓ for Page Up/Down not working any more in Yosemite <body> In Mavericks I could use kbd⌘/kbd + kbd↑/kbd/kbd↓/kbd for Page Up/Down but it's not working anymore. I googled it and some people said it's kbdfn/kbd + kbd↑/kbd/kbd↓/kbd but thats also not working. How can I fix that?  <comment178751> I just tested this on Yosemite and it is working for me. Do you have any keyboard shortcuts set which may override this? (System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts) Is there a specific program where you're having a problem? <comment179145> Thanks for your help. I just figgured it's a [Firefox](http://www.erfahrungen.com/mit/Firefox/) Plugin that caused this problem. Fixed now :)
