10.9.5 mac pro - cannot ssh out <body> I cannot ssh to any server.  precodessh -vvv joe@ip   OpenSSH_6.2p2, OSSLShim 0.9.8r 8 Dec 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/joe/.ssh/config debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to ip [ip] port 22. debug1: connect to address ip port 22: Connection refused ssh: connect to host ip port 22: Connection refused /code/pre  .ssh/config (pushing/pulling git works fine)  precodeHost github.com     Hostname ssh.github.com     Port 443 /code/pre  ssh_config  precodeHost *     SendEnv LANG LC_* /code/pre  something strange, I can't SSH to anything however, github works and if I use the "ssh" button in google cloud, it will connect to the server from there.  something wrong with my terminal?  something that maybe important, in the known hosts file, the ports are all 443  when checking logs on the server, no attempt is ever noted for my ipaddress, so my request never hits the server.  [UPDATE]  took the laptop home and tried it, logged in no problem.  so its not the computer, its not the server, its not the router because I skipped it.  verizon and our office line must use the same backbone in the area.  its something with the lines there.  not good!  I'll let anyone know if/when I figure out more, thanks for help everyone.  <comment177275> i've manually added the entry to the known hosts, but still no luck.  port 22 is open on the server and sshd is listening. <comment177279> How you tried loggin in as another user on your machine and SSH from there? There might be something wrong/strange/funny with your .ssh config. <comment177284> I have not tried that yet, but I should also note that the servers that i've been unable to connect to (verified) are centos 6 / 7 <comment177285> What does `telnet ip 22` output?, <comment177286> trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx telnet: connect to address xxx..xxx: connection refused  telnet: unable to connect to remote host <comment177287> @cousinCocaine using a different account had no effect <comment177290> So if login in from your Mac as a different user (lets say the Guest account) and than log in to the server did not work? And you are convinced the server is working and no firewall is up? And what about a SFTP login? Or using another machine to test the connection (like your phone) <comment177291> Ping? I think something is blocking your connection. And the error is not on your machine. Mightbe you have `fail2ban` or alike software installed. <comment177293> ping works fine, nothing lost.  logging on as a different user still did not allow login (i did put key on server) the only way I can access it is from the google console 'ssh' button. <comment177294> What does `/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate` output? <comment177295> @MaxRied Firewall is disabled. (State=0) also tried from phone, and would not go through <comment177296> Is your phone connected through cellular network? Or to the same network as your computer is? <comment177297> verizon network <comment177300> Your computer is connected via a landline? <comment177303> t1 line - no router <comment177304> i tried changing port 22 to other ports and still get the same, connection refused from the mac
