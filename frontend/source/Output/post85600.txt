Mac Mini with mountain Lion sets brightness to max <body> My Mac mini is automatically putting my monitor brightness to 100%. Inside my display settings, there is no option to set brigthness to the monitor, and I set it directly on Monitor.  Any clue how to disable my Mac mini altering the settings?  It is a Late 2012 Mac mini with Mountain Lion.  Here are my codepmset/code settings:  precode standby              0  powerbutton          1  womp                 1  autorestart          0  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            10  sleep                10 (sleep prevented by )  autopoweroffdelay    14400  hibernatemode        0  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         10  standbydelay         4200 /code/pre  I just figured that it happens on new tab on Google Chrome. What could it be?  <comment98672> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20237/can-i-change-the-brightness-on-a-secondary-display <comment98721> It didnt work.
