Safari: Can I open all bookmarks in a bookmark folder in a new window? <body> Is it possible to open all bookmarks in a bookmark folder in Safari in a strongnew/strong Safari window?   I know that I can do this with a single bookmark, but can I do the same with a bookmark folder?  <answer144217> Open the Bookmarks menu, top left, right click the folder of bookmarks, Open in Tabs...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tLO0C.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Though irritatingly, it re-uses the current window, so maybe start with a new one first.  <answer259754> Option click folder in Favorites.   <answer283365> use Bookmarks-Show BookMarks from the Safari menu. This will open all the list of bookmarks on your left side. There you can rearrange or edit the bookmarks.  <comment169898> Yes - but this opens the tabs in the *actual* window - I would like them to open in a *new* window. <comment169900> Instant notifications of changes are a curse..... But this extra step inexactly what I want to avoid. <comment325007> on Bookmark bar <comment357232> How does this help OP "open all bookmarks in a bookmark folder in Safari in a new Safari window"?
