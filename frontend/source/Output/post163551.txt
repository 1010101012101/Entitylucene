MacBook pro - External screen flickering after reconect <body> I have MacBook Pro late 2011. When I am at home, I use it with my external monitor, when I connect external monitor for the first time (after reboot), everything works fine, but when I disconnect the external monitor and reconnect it again, the external monitor starts flickering and external monitor screen starts turning on and off. The MacBook's default screen works fine. If I reboot macbook and then connect monitor, everything works fine until I disconnect and reconnect it again, then it starts doing that weird things again.  I don't want to reboot my MacBook after every time I disconnect external monitor... I am thinking, maybe I am not disconnecting the external display right. I just disconnect the cable. Should i be doing it another way?   Does someone have some experiences with that? Could someone suggest me any solution?   <answer228097> I have a similar problem, a lot of people recommended resetting the smc. and it seemed to work for a lot but not me. You should try it anyway, can't hurt. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295  <answer228103> The problem was with non original power adapter. I've bought the original from Apple and the problem occurred no more...  <comment191566> disconnecting hot wire is always challenging. So turn the external monitor off first then disconnect. <comment191625> That does not seems to help.
