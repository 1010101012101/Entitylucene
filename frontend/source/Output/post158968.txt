Manually clear dns cache on mavericks <body> My DNS cache is broken for a few websites (most notably codeship.com) so I need to clear it.  As instructed on numerous websites I've run  precodedscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  in various permutations, including rebooting, but it has no effect.  When running codedig/code I get no codeANSWER SECTION/code, but I don't know how to interpret the rest of the info.  precode; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; codeship.com ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL, id: 15470 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;codeship.com.

Codeship's DNS provider is recovering from a DDOS attack. https://twitter.com/codeship/status/539510336227770368 <comment186913> Ok, that's the last time I trust what downforeveryoneorjustme.com says.
