Why is my iPhone playing the notification sound but no notification is showing? <body> A few minutes ago I was listening to music on my iPhone and the music faded out and then the notification sound played but no notifcation showed. (it has done this about 10-15 times now) Does anyone know what could possibly be wrong with my iPhone? I have an iPhone 3GS running on iOS 5.0.1.  Sometimes it's an email sound but other times it's the actual notification sound. I have it set up to show the little notification at the top for new emails so it should show a notifcation even when the email sound plays. Most of the time it shows a notification but sometimes it doesn't.   Maybe this is just a bug?   <answer31915> Check if you have the new Gmail app installed.  Every time it gets a new email, it triggers the "iphone Text Message sound".  The sound can be disabled via Settings app  Notifications  Gmail  uncheck Sound.  <comment36798> Yes, I have the Gmail app installed. So that's the problem. Thanks for your answer! <comment36799> Is there a way to turn this sound off? It is very annoying. I use the main Mail app but I like having the Gmail app too. <comment36816> Go to Settings app  Gmail and disable the sound for notifications.  If this solves it, please mark my answer as Correct answer.  Thanks. <comment36821> There's no disable sound notifications. Look at this screen shot I took: http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/2418/photonov2430033am.png There's only 2 options. Any ideas? <comment36851> Sorry, I meant to say go to Settings app  Notifications  Gmail, then disable Sound. <comment36857> Oh, yeah, I found it now. Thanks.
