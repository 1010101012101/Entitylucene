Is it possible to restore PATH? <body> So I accidentally run in terminal command codeexport PATH="/usr/bin/php/bin"/code which override my defaults and none of the commands aren't responding.  precodeMacBook-Pro-Kil:home $ sudo -bash: sudo: command not found /code/pre  Is it possible somehow restore it? My system is 10.9.5  <answer192957> Assuming you’re not willing to give up your active terminal session, try to bootstrap your settings like this:  precodeexport PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin; source ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  The part that says codeexport PATH=…/code is there to bootstrap an environment for code~/.bash_profile/code, which might itself rely on one or more of the paths given.  <comment229806> Your path is bind to your session. Open a new terminal window and you should be good to go.
