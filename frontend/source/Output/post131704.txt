Which of the GNU coreutils applications are included in the MacPorts coreutils package? <body> In general, I would like to know if there are any discrepancies between the MacPorts coreutils and the GNU coreutils, and how I might go about answering this question myself. In particular, I don't understand why the codesu/code command (or the codegsu/code command, since all of the MacPorts coreutils applications also seem to come prefixed with a 'g') doesn't seem to be included by MacPorts.  First, I check that I have the coreutils package installed:  precode$ port installed coreutils The following ports are currently installed:   coreutils @8.22_0 (active)  $ port info coreutils coreutils @8.22 (sysutils) Variants:             universal  Description:          The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell, and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating                       system. These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system. Previously                       these utilities were offered as three individual sets of GNU utilities, fileutils, shellutils, and                       textutils. Those three have been combined into a single set of utilities called the coreutils. Homepage:             http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/  [...] /code/pre  So far so good. Then I look for instances of codesu/code and codegsu/code on my path:  precode$ which -a su gsu;  /usr/bin/su /code/pre  Nothing; the GNU codesu/code isn't there. As a sanity check, I look for some other coreutils applications, e.g. coderm/code:  precodewhich -a rm grm /opt/local/libexec/gnubin/rm /bin/rm /opt/local/bin/grm /code/pre  It looks like the directories to check are code/opt/local/bin/code and code/opt/local/libexec/gnubin/code, so I look there:  precode$ ls -1 /opt/local/bin /opt/local/libexec/gnubin | grep -x 'su\|gsu' /code/pre  Again, nothing. Now, this is almost certainly redundant, but I also try looking with the codeport contents/code command:  precode$ port contents coreutils | grep -x ".*su" /code/pre  Nothing. Am I certain that codesu/code is included in GNU coreutils? No, I guess not. So I check here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities#Programs_included_in_coreutils  It looks like it is; it's listed under the Shell Utililites header. So what gives?  <answer131715> su has moved from coreutils to the utils-linux project since v8.18, since it's more aligned with the linux specific routines in PAM etc. http://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;a=commit;h=928dd737  For more portable and light weight switching of user credentials, one can use gchroot --user=... /  I've amended wikipedia appropriately
