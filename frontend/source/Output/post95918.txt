Attribute appropriate amount of resource to run Mac OS + Windows + Ubuntu simultaneously <body> I have a MacBook Pro where codeVMWare Fusion/code is installed to enable codeWindows 7/code and codeUbuntu/code. One year ago, my system was well configured so that I could run codeMac OS/code, codeWindows/code and codeUbuntu/code at the same time. Later, I made some changes, probably around the attribution of cores and memories, now running the 3 systems simultaneously is very slow, although only running codeMac OS + Windows/code or codeMac OS+Ubuntu/code is fast enough. But I do need the 3 systems open for my work.  The resource for the 3 systems are listed as follows. Does anyone know how to arrange the ressource to re-enable the running of 3 systems simultaneously? Or does anyone have a good idea to make it possible?   Here is the resource of my Mac: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XEzLE.png" alt="enter image description here"   Here is the resource attributed to Ubuntu: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FQqha.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is the resource attributed to Windows: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UUJYN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer95936> I use codeParallels/code for virtualization but I also run three OS simultaneously (codeOSX/code, codeWindows 7/code and codeWindows 8/code).  My settings are: 2 cores and 2 GB of RAM for each VM and more important codeVT-x/code support enabled, in your screenshot the first checkbox under Advanced Options.
