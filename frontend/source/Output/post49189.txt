Is there any good iPhone stand with high-quality microphone for my desk? <body> I use my iPhone 4 to go jogging and at some point the built-in mic has gotten damaged and the only way to talk to people is via an earbud with mic.  I am looking for a desk charger which also has a high-quality mic so that I can take calls from my desk, hands-free. Does anyone know of a suitable product?  <answer53314> There is no product that provides a stand and charger with a mic, but there are several external mics you can clip onto the iPhone. Some (lower quality) use the headphone jack, and some (higher quality) use the 30-pin docking port.  Here are two examples:  IK Multimedia iRig Mic Cast  This mic uses the headphone jack.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rnHCY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Tascam iM2W stereo mic  This mic uses the docking port, but has a pass-through USB connection that permits charging while the mic is in use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AELSy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer53316> I'd recommend using Apple's own dock. There's an audio plug which will allow you to plug in any microphone you like, either directly (if it's iPhone compatible) or with a breakout cable.  Then you can connect any non-USB microphone you like.  <comment60876> Which iPhone model is it? <comment60922> Updated: It's a 4 but I guess it applies to 4S also...
