Why doesn't my name show when I send a text message? <body> When I send a text message, my name does not show up to the recipient; only my number.br Is there some way to change the settings to have my name show up instead of the number?   <answer196523> The recipient would have to have your contact added in order to associate your name to your number.   Also, sometimes the format of the number would matter: it's better if the recipient copies the number as it appears when you send him am SMS.
