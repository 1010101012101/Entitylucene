Is there an easier keyboard shortcut for taking a screenshot on OSX 10.5? <body> I'm running OSX 10.5 and was wondering if there is an easier way to make screenshots emwhich save to clipboard?/em  I know I can use:  kbdCMD/kbd+kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdSHIFT/kbd+kbd4/kbd  However this is hard on the fingers.  <answer81935> You can set up a custom shortcut, for example a key, for that purpose.  Open System Prefrences, go to Keyboard - Screen Shots (or navigate to the Screen Shot-options), and double click on the shortcuts you want to change to change them to the keys you use less frequently. If you have a huge keyboard like me, you can for example set the kbdF5/kbd and kbdF6/kbd to be the shortcuts.  Here is a screen shot of the settings window where you set the shortcut (captured with those as well!) The "Copy"-screenshots are the ones with kbdControl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/82nha.png" alt="Screenshot"
