Identify what version of DisplayPort supported on the Thunderbolt port <body> How do I tell what version of DisplayPort is support on a Mac’s Thunderbolt port, when running macOS El Capitan or Sierra?  I tried using the emSystem Information/em app.   ul liNo item listed for “DisplayPort”. /li liThe “Graphics/Displays” item lists video cards./li liThe “Thunderbolt” item has no information about DisplayPort./li /ul  My Samsung 4K monitor has an switch setting for either DisplayPort 1.1 or 1.2. So I'd like to match appropriately to my MacBook Pro.  This Question seemed to be asking this question. But it is not exactly clear. And no Answer directly addressed the issue.  <comment321298> What model Mac are you running? And what macOS? <comment321300> @Monomeeth Answered (El Capitan or Sierra). As for which Mac model, I am looking for an answer that works across various Macs; I am asking how to look up the version of DisplayPort supported in general, not for this one specific Mac.
