Brightness on bootcamp is totally off <body> So i have a MBP retina 15" that has a Windows 7 Bootcamp partition.br The other day I noticed my screen was a little dirty so I took the screen brightness all the way down (kbdfn/kbd+ kbdf1/kbd) and did this while Windows 7 was locked.br I now cannot get the brightness back up.  I have hard booted and it seems to get back to the Windows 7 login screen.  I'm not 100% sure if it's there but if I press kbdesc/kbd, I can hear the Windows emting/em error sound.  So it seems that i am there.  Is there any way to "reset" the brightness for bootcamp?  <answer206743> just had the same issue. there are 3 Options:  ul liyou are connected to local LAN and able to log on remotely and can find the registry setting or slider in energy options/li liyou connect a 2nd external monitor and with some luck it shows at least some Desktop/li liyou reinstall windows :(/li /ul  <comment111925> See if this answer will help you: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/94390/mbp-boot-camp-windows-8-brightness-issue/94391#94391
