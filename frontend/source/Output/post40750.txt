Is the installation of Xcode from App Store enough for having the developer tools? <body> today I tried to install the new version of Xcode. Before that I removed the developer tools with the following command:  precodesudo /Library/Developer/Shared/uninstall-devtools --mode=all /code/pre  I also had other folder in code/Library/Developer/code such as 4.2 4.2.1 ...  After that I installed the new Xcode and I noticed that the folder code/Library/Developer/code contains only the codeShared/code folder, which doesn't contain the command codeuninstall-devtools/code.  Did I install the developer tools or do I have to do something more?  Another related problem is that when I try to install Flann through Homebrew it reports the following error:     xcode-select: Error: No Xcode folder is set. Run codexcode-select -switch &lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;/code to set the path to the Xcode folder.   How can I fix it?  <answer40753> Installing Xcode 4.3 does install the developer tools, but not for command line access. With this version, everything has been moved into the application bundle, which means there is no need for a uninstaller, since you can just delete the application. If you want to install the command line tools, open Xcode and go to Xcode  Preferences  Downloads, select the Components tab, and click the button next to Command Line Tools. (This might add an uninstaller somewhere, but I'm not sure.)  As for Homebrew, you might have to wait for an update before it supports Xcode 4.3, since everything was moved. I would suggest trying code/Applications/Xcode.app/code as the code&lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;/code, since most of the hierarchy appears to be the same.  The homebrew developers are tracking these changes in their bug database so, you may want to monitor this thread for workarounds and notification of when the homebrew system will effortlessly work with the new changes for Xcode 4.3.  <answer40761> Apple is providing these command line developer tools as a stand alone package now, so you may wish to get a free developer account if you don't want to wait for homebrew to change and locate / link to the new directory structure.  A nice summary of the state of affairs on Xcode 4.3.x and older as well as the upcoming changes and benefits of having the command line tools packaged by Apple officially with headers is on Kenneth Reitz's blog.  <answer40767> When you download Xcode from the App Store, you're actually downloading an app called Install Xcode. You need to run that if you haven't; I'm not clear on whether or not you performed this step. Once you do that, you will have   precode/Developer/Applications/Xcode.app /code/pre  and other components (assuming you install to the default location), but look for Xcode.app first.  <answer43920> codexcode-select -select "/Applications/Xcode.app"/code fixed this problem for me.  Everything is peachy now.  <comment46086> I think XCode is now installed under /Developer <comment46088> I don't have the folder /Developer... Don't know why! <comment46090> So in you opinion if I have already installed XCode and the Command Line Tools then am I in the same situation of this morning? :D (Of course with a newer version of the dev tools). <comment46101> If you type `man xcode-select` you will discover that the right path is /Applications/Xcode.app/ <comment46127> @Jason with the update in 4.3, Xcode now installs into /Applications, no longer uses the /Developer folders. <comment46129> This has changed with the release of Xcode 4.3 which installs in /Applications as any other application. /Developer is not used any longer and Xcode 4.3 offers to delete it when starting for the first time. <comment46131> Ah, thanks. I'm still using Xcode 4.2 here. <comment46132> Xcode 4.3 is actually the root cause for all these Xcode related questions today. <comment46151> @lucaghera OK, thanks. I was just guessing that it wanted the Developer folder. I'll fix my answer then.
