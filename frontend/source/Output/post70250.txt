What is the difference between a Mac mini and a Mac mini server (late-2012)? <body> I've been over the tech specs for both the high-end mac mini with the fusion drive and the mac mini server (http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/mac_mini) and I cannot find more than a single difference; the server has two HDDs (oh, and it ships with os x server installed).  Am I missing something or are you paying $200 more for a second HDD? Or $150 more for a 1TB fusion drive vs 256GB SSD and 1 TB HDD?  <answer70255> You have to decide what you want in terms of storage, performance and OS since there is no option to have 2x1TB drives in the $799 model and there's no option to have a 1TB Fusion Drive in the $999 model.  Essentially, you're paying $200 more to get OS X Server and for the ability to have a second hard drive (doing it yourself is an option if you can follow guides on iFixit and have the tools and accessories required).  hr  Choose the $799 model with:  ol liA 1TB Fusion Drive - $250/li liOS X Server - $19.99/li /ol  Total: $1068.99 (but you'll have a faster drive but half the storage space of the default $999 model).  hr  Choose the $799 model with the default 1TB drive:  ol liadd another 1TB 2.5" 5400 rpm drive - about $80+ (approximate cost from newegg)/li liOS X Server - $19.99/li liThe Mac mini Dual Hard Drive kit from iFixit - $49.95  /li /ol  Total: $948.94br Hassle of doing it yourself: Priceless
