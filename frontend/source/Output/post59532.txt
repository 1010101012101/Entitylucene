Create Automator Service With a Python Script? <body> I'm trying to create an Automator Service that will act on selected text, converting dashes to spaces, and also making word caps for all the text.  A friend gave me this python script (I know nothing about python or shell scripting):  precode#! /usr/bin/python  cliptext = "%clipboard" print cliptext.replace('-', ' ').replace('%', ' ').replace('&amp;', ' and ').replace('#', ' ').title() /code/pre  It works great as a TextExpander snippet, but I'd like to have it available in the Services menu as well. I don't need it to use any specific scripting language, it just needs to run within Automator. My coding buddy had no experience with Automator so he couldn't help out. His script requires copying the text to the clipboard, and then runs the formatting and pastes the result. I'd like to be able to just run this on the selected text and not have to deal with the Clipboard (at least manually).  The particular use for this is to rename photo uploads on Flickr, since Flickr uses the filename to generate the photo name. When exporting artwork via Photoshop or Illustrator using Save For Web, the lowercase and dashes are my default settings. I want to be able to highlight the Flickr title, and then run the Service to reformat the file name to a properly formatted title.  <answer59538> This isn't too difficult to do, you just need to know the right magic. I'll walk you through it.  ol liOpen Automator, and when prompted to choose a type for your document, select strongService/strong. If you're not prompted, just hit âŒ˜N to make a new automator file./li liAt the top of the rightmost panel, make sure that strongOutput replaces selected text/strong is checked, and the first drop-down is set to strongtext/strong: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bUPEI.png" alt="service input settings"  ul liYou can change the emany application/em part to a specific application if you only want it to work in that program./li /ul/li liIn the Actions Library in the left panel, find strongRun Shell Script/strong and double click it to add it to the workflow./li liChange the emShell/em drop down to strong/usr/bin/python/strong, and make sure that emPass input/em is set to strongstdin/strong./li liDelete the existing text in the script box, and replace it with the code below./li liSave it with a descriptive name.

I have limited understanding of AppleScript, but none with shell scripts.
