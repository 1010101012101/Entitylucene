My internet in my MBP gets really slow or stops when I connect to my router <body> My internet gets really low (0.8 - 0.2 kb/s) or really just drop to 0, it started 3 months ago. I use "Automatic" and another using Googles Public DNS for my location. I am using wifi on my MBP to connect to the internet. In my iPhone, the internet is pretty consistent, it's just on my MBP that disconnects a lot.   So, what I do to resolve, I turn off my wifi on my MBP and turn it on, it connects automatically and I have my internet back. The speed rise up again up to 50kb/s. I do this every 15-30 mins, because the speed just fall or just drop to 0 again.  What could be wrong and how do I resolve it?, It's becoming annoying that I keep resetting my wi-fi.  Thank You!  <comment116085> Could you clarify if this is a Wi-Fi or an Internet? From the 2nd part of your question it does seem just a Wi-Fi one and not at all an Internet one. If I read you right I suggest you to change the subject of your question to get relevant answers. <comment116180> Could you check which interface your *Automatic* location is connecting you through when you are correctly connected **and** when you have problems with your network? Could you add this information to your original question? <comment116181> Is this with all access points or just with one particular wifi router? <comment116240> @AllInOne I think this only happens in my particular router, because when I'm outside, the internet seem pretty consistent.
