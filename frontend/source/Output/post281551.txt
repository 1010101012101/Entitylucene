Java installation: continue button greyed out <body> Every once in a while, I am asked to update my Java installation. I click update, it downloads and installation runs smoothly. Except in the end when it asks me whether I want to restore security prompts. The continue button is greyed out (regardless of whether I check the option or not).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nnOpw.png" alt=""  In the end, I just close the window.   strongMy question:/strong Does this matter? Did it install correctly? And how do I check it?   strongInfo:/strong macOS Sierra, Java version 8 update 131 (build 1.8.0_131-b11).  emExtra information/em Not sure if it is related, but I constantly get the annoying Java prompts, saying "To view this web content, you need to install the Java Runtime Environment" that I can't seem to get rid of (they are described here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZI_oongYqo).   <comment354303> You can check if it installed properly by opening the Java control panel in System Preferences, and clicking About on the General tab. Or you can visit https://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp in your browser. <comment354618> The test appears to indicate I have the correct version. Maybe it doesn't really matter.
