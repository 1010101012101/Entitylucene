How to interact with dialog boxes using keyboard that appear not to allow keyboard interaction? <body> I recently asked a question: How to navigate the Special Characters window with the keyboard?  However, it seems to me that OSX has a class of dialog boxes that seem to be inaccessible to keyboard activation.  ul liFinder - View Options/li liTextEdit - Fonts/li liTextEdit - Special Characters/li liOmniFocus - Inspector/li /ul  I.e., there will be a shortcut key to show the dialog box, but in order to interact with the dialog box you need to use the mouse or trackpad. I.e., Control + backtick does not activate them. I note that this is not the case with all such dialog boxes. E.g., most preference dialog boxes, the info dialog box in Finder, etc. permit keyboard activation.  ul liDoes this class of dialog boxes have a special name?/li liWhat do people who prefer to use the keyboard almost exclusively do with such dialog boxes?/li /ul  <answer71654> I did a little bit of searching and found this page on OSX accessibility.  They might be called "Utility Windows".  ul liControl + F6 Moves focus to the first (or next) utility window /li liControl + Shift + F6 Moves focus to the first (or  previous) utility window/li /ul  Once inside, Tab and Shift tab can be used to navigate.  Interestingly, these shortcut keys worked with the following dialog boxes  ul liFinder - View Options/li liTextEdit - Fonts/li /ul  But did not work with these  ul liTextEdit - Special Characters/li liOmniFocus - Inspector/li /ul  <comment83216> I canâ€™t remember what they are called, but I do know that they never take keyboard focus and thus have a light grey title bar.
