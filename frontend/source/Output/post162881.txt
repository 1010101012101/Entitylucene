How do I sign out of iCloud on iOS6 <body> How do I sign out of iCloud on iOS6.  I have created a 2nd AppleID I want to use for iCloud synching, but the only option I get is "Delete Account". I don't want to delete the AppleID (which is used on other devices), just change to the new account  <answer162883> My old link for this dried up, but delete account is really "delete this account from my device".    The text of this article confirms that, but unfortunately I can't find an apple.com link currently.   Reading this thread will also confirm it for you, although indirectly.
