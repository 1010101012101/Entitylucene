Keychain access is repeatedly requested for same passwords <body> At some point after installing Sierra, Keychain option "always allow" stopped working.  Every app that needs access to remembered passwords will ask me to enter my master Keychain password every single time. Even SSH requires it to decrypt keys to login whereas before this it did not.  Some have suggested using Keychain First Aid, but that menu option no longer seems to exist in Keychain in Sierra.  I tried doing codeEdit &gt; Change Password for Keychain "login"/code and that fixed the problem with SSH and various programs requesting the logins repeatedly, but now anything that needs access to "Local Items" or "System" passwords (such as addressbook sync) will request the password repeatedly. This didn't happen before resetting the "login" keychain.  Resetting the "login" keychain also seems to have caused all Google app authentications to require re-approval every time I switch WiFi networks. For instance, I have to re-approve every Airmail email account every time I connect to WiFi.  There is no option to reset the "Local Items" or "System" keychain passwords.  I tried resetting my iCloud password which is used to unlock my Mac, but every time I click the "Change iCloud Password" button all I get is a never ending loading spinner.  What could be going on here and how do I fix it?
