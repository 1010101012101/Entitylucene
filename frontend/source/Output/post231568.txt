Quicklook for fullscreen terminal <body> I recently realized you can use quicklook from the command line. Here's the example: codeqlmanage -p somefile.txt &gt;&amp; /dev/null &amp;/code When this command is invoked quicklook opens its popup *in a different desktop*.  What I'd like is for quicklook to open in the *same* desktop window as full-screened terminal (just above it). Is this possible with quicklook?
