Install OS X Lion on a Mac mini <body> I borrowed a Core 2 Duo Mac mini. I want to back up the HDD and wipe off the OS Leopard that it has so that I can later re-install it back. Then I want to upgrade to OS X Lion. Can this Mac mini run Lion? What steps should I take? specs here: mac mini 3.1 Intel core 2 duo 2.26ghz 4gb ram  <answer63338> 1GB of RAM is insufficient for OS X 10.7 "Lion."  You'll need 2GB or more.:  OS X Lion - Technical Specifications General requirements  ul liMac computer with an Intel Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or Xeon processor /li li2GB of memory /li liOS X v10.6.6 or later (v10.6.8 recommended)/li li7GB of available space/li /ul  <comment73209> And if you get more RAM for your mini, I would start by installing Lion on to an external drive. You can boot off an external OS quite easily on Mac until you get used to imaging / backing up / restoring. <comment73281> updated the specs..i have 4gb ram <comment73308> Then both Lion and Mountain Lion will run quite well - personally I'd recommend ML instead. <comment73888> is there any article detailing steps to clone the existing snow leopard before i start installing lion and steps to install lion for a usb drive. i've a dmg image <comment73903> I'm a fan of [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/) for cloning an existing system, but there are other options like SuperDuper that can do this as well.  Remember to test booting from the cloned/backup before making changes to the original system.  Then use Disk Utility to restore the InstalLESD.dmg from inside the Install Lion.app package to your flash drive.
