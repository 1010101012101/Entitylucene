Hard Drive: I can see it in /Volumes, but it does not show up in Finder <body> I'm connecting my external Hard Drive on my Mac. It's a NTFS drive. It used to show up normally on Finder's sidebar and Desktop as well, but it doesn't anymore.  strongBut it does show up in /Volumes folder. I can see all the folder and go through./strong  So, here what I tried:  strong1)/strong codediskutil list/code lists my external drive:  precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2    1:               Windows_NTFS LUCAS                   1.0 TB     disk2s1 /code/pre  hr  strong2)/strong codeGetFileInfo /Volumes/LUCAS/code does not have the capital letter V (means it's strongnot/strong invisible).  hr  strong3)/strong Whenever I connect the HD, it gives me two weird messages on console:     mds[62]: (Volume.Normal:166) vsd:0x7fe0b30a2200 DisabledStore recycle:6br   context:{br      DisabledRecycleCount = 6;br   }   and     mds[62]: (Volume.Error:577) vsd:0x7fe0b397d000 Open failed.  failureCount:6 {br      DisabledRecycleCount = 6;br   }   hr  strong4)/strong Yep, I also tried the codechflags nohidden /Volumes/LUCAS/code. No luck.  hr  So, what can I do? I can browse the drive, but it just doesn't mount. That's all.  <comment257034> I don't understand what you mean in your "2)" attempt to fix it. `mds` is the process that helps Spotlight works. <comment257041> @IronCraftMan If GetFileInfo item shows ...v... invisibility of the item is turned **off** and respectively ...V... invisibility is turned **on** <comment257043> In Finder preferences, under General, is "Hard disks" or "External disks" (depending on how it sees your drive) turned on? How about the same option under the Sidebar pane? <comment257049> @timothymh Yes, it's all set. <comment257050> Does it show up in Disk Utility? <comment257275> @IronCraftMan Yes, as I said in **1)** <comment257284> @LucasVeiga not in diskutil, but in the actual GUI. <comment257359> @IronCraftMan Yes, also on actual GUI. It works normal, it just doesn't mount on desktop or Finder's sidebar. <comment257387> @LucasVeiga are you using any special software to use NTFS formatted drives? <comment257422> I was using Paragon in trial mode, but it's trial evaluated. In fact, now you said, this problem just show up after the trial ended. <comment258281> @IronCraftMan I was using Paragon. <comment258284> @LucasVeiga and there's your issue. Please include those details (The software, and that the trial ended). Please remove paragon and restart. Then plug in your drive and see what happens <comment258541> @IronCraftMan Done. Removed. Restarted. Nothing yet.
