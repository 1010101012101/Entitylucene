Reinstall free app <body> How do you reinstall a free app that you deleted on an iPad? I tried to go into the App Store and go to updates and purchased and went to not on this device - because it was not a purchase it just says open! I can't reinstall it!  <answer161983> Looks like a bug to me. Have you tried turning off and on your iPad?  Also you may try to close the App Store app and then opening it again. To do so, press the home button twice, swipe up the App Store, press home button again.  Open App Store again see if you can install the app.  <answer162016> I install via iTunes.

Find the correct one and then hit the button to its right saying install
