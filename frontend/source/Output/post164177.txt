Find Mac's "age" in Yosemite <body> I upgraded a Mac to OS X Yosemite and would like to find the age (when it's been released). In previous OS it was given here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L2yqt.png" alt="Details under Mac OS X Mavericks"  but I can't find it in Yosemite there  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t9VaN.png" alt="Cant find age"  ...anyone?  <answer164178> It should be right under the the OS X Yosemite.  Checked 3 different models and all showed in the same place.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CtKNE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer164182> Or, on the same window, you can go to the emSupport/em tab and click emSpecifications/em to get even more information.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tKPxY.png" alt="About This Mac/Support"  <answer164427> You could also check for your device or any other device when you have the serial number at  selfsolfe.apple.com  <comment192386> Well it's not...see new pic in my question <comment192391> According to the serial number it's a "MacBook Pro "Core i7" 2.66 15" Mid-2010". I assume you already tried to reboot. Is there anything of interest in `/var/log/system.log` around the time you access "About this Mac"? <comment192392> @patrix where do I find the /var index? <comment192393> Open Terminal and `sudo less /var/log/system.log`. Or run the Console application <comment192395> @patrix nothing I would find helpful <comment192396> @patrix but I ran the command and now in the details it shows it, thank you :) <comment192397> @Ummsekatze It might be a bug in 10.10 - can you open the app store and install updates until you are at 10.10.1 ? <comment192402> You run `sudo less...` and now the model is shown in "About this Mac"? <comment192403> Yeah maybe it was randomly... <comment192421> Are you connected to the Network?  I believe System Information contacts http://support-sp.apple.com to get that info and populate the About this Mac window. <comment192790> possible duplicate of [Is there a way to find the age of a specific Mac?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/91925/is-there-a-way-to-find-the-age-of-a-specific-mac) <comment192804> @tron_jones actually I was not, but I did not connect later either so this is not necessarily true
