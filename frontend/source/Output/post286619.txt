Is there any way to achieve gmail's mail bundling feature on another client? <body> Gmail introduced the awesome bundles feature a while back that automatically bundles e-mails that belongs together as they arrive. It will for instance create travel bundles for each trip - grouping flights and hotel reservations together, or payment bundles for receipts.  Is anyone aware of a way to achieve this with a native e-mail client?
