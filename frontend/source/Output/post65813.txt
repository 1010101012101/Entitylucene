What speed is the SATA controller in a medio 2010 Macbook Pro <body> I've got a Macbook Pro 15" 2,4GHz i5, medio 2010. I would like to upgrade to a solid state disk. But will I benefit from a disk with read/write speeds of 500 mb/s? Or what is the max speed that is supported by my SATA controller?  Thank you in advance  <answer65816> You can find the speed of your SATA controller with the codeSystem Information/code application, by clicking codesystem report &gt; hardware &gt; Serial ATA/code. Which in my case (a 15" 2.53GHz 2010 MBP) shows the following:  precodeIntel 5 Series Chipset:    Vendor:                   Intel   Product:                  5 Series Chipset   Link Speed:               3 Gigabit   Negotiated Link Speed:    3 Gigabit   Description:              AHCI Version 1.30 Supported /code/pre  3 Gigabit means the maximum uncoded transfer rate is 2.4 Gbit/s or about 300MB/s (286MiB/s).  In conclusion: a 500MB/s disk is probably overkill.  <comment77424> Thanks a lot for this info. By my computer the Link speed is 3 Gigabit, but the negotiated link speed is 1,5 Gigabit. So, which number does affects my transfer rate? Sorry I'm quite a noob. <comment77431> I believe that has to do with the disk currently in your Macbook. When you change the disk it should show the negotiated link speed as 3 Gigabit.
