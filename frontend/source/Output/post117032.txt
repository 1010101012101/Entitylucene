What is the best way to automatically create a movie from my iPhoto videos? <body> When I first started using a Mac almost 6 years ago iMovie had a mode (automovie?) where I could just throw a folder at it and it would create a movie from all the photos and videos. This was a great way for someone with no time to create a family video.  Now I'm trying to do basically the same thing with iMovie '09 and iPhoto and can't figure out the best way.  I want an all-Apple or free solution to just taking all the videos from my iPhoto library and putting them into a movie in chronological order. I really won't want to spend hours dragging and dropping clips into a movie (either on my Mac or on the iPad in iMovie or Avid Studio).  What is the best way to do this?  EDIT: I realized I have iMovie '09 not '11 as first reported so that might change the technique. In the bottom left of iMovie I do see an entry labeled iPhoto Videos but it is always empty.  <answer117057> ol liOpen the strongiPhoto Library/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jLL0r.png" width="200"/li liClick strongCreate/strong â†’ strongMovie/strong and select strongNo Theme/strong./li liSelect the photos/videos./li liPress strongE/strong.

It isn't working. I have iPhoto 9.5.1 and iMovie '09 (8.0.6). I don't see the iPhoto Library option you mention so I assume that's something specific to iMovie '11. Any idea how to make it work in '09? <comment316552> I have iMovie 10 (not '10), and hitting "E" just makes it beep.
