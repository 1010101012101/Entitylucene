Unhide /etc dir but NOT using 'AppleShowAllFiles'. Possible? <body> I frequently use and edit config files inside /etc on OS X Lion. I would like to be able to access this dir in Finder easily, but don't want to unhide hidden files system-wide using codedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles/code.  Anyone know how?  <answer54385> Although its not exactly what you want, you could make an emApplication/em with strongAutomator/strong.  To do so:  ul liOpen strongAutomator/strong./li liSelect strongWork Flow/strong./li liSelect strongRun Shell Script/strong and type codeopen /etc/code./li liHit emSave/em and choose strongApplication/strong as the format./li /ul  You will, then, be able to open the strongetc/strong folder by double clicking the emApplication/em you've just created.  <answer54387> On my system running Lion (10.7.4), the command codesudo chflags -h nohidden /etc/code revealed the code/etc/code folder at the top level of my hard drive.  The code-h/code flag to codechflags/code makes it act on a symbolic link rather than on the linked file.  The codeman/code page for codechflags/code states "Unless the -H or -L options are given, chflags on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect." The behavior I observe when I run it is not consistent with this description: I very much do see an effect when I run codechflags/code on this particular symlink.  If that solution doesn't work for you, or if you don't want to make /etc visible to all users on your system but you emdo/em want to easily navigate there in the Finder and in Open, Save, etc. dialog boxes, you could run a command like codeln -s /etc ~/etc/code. That would create a (visible) symbolic link to the code/etc/code directory in your home directory. When you double click it, it would open the code/etc/code directory (actually the code/Private/etc/code directory because code/etc/code is a symlink thereto in OS X).  <answer54483> Enable ShowAllFiles one more time, long enough to drag code/etc/code onto your Finder sidebar.  From then on, code/etc/code will be available in Finder and in Open and Save As dialogs, regardless of ShowAllFiles.  <comment62228> What files do you edit here as Apple has tended to move config elsewhere so only old Unix files are there - if you do this often aren't you using the terminal a lot. <comment62248> Hi Mark. It's usually to edit apache config files when setting up vhosts, ssl certs etc. It's a lot of cut and paste work which I find far easier to do in GUI text editors than terminal. Often I want to 'save to' something in /etc/apache2 from within an application too. <comment62249> Thanks, that's an idea, but I often want to be able to save to or open from /etc/* from within apps (Apache configs and SSL certs etc) <comment62967> That symlink to /etc idea is excellent! Such a good idea I didn't need to try your first solution. thanks! <comment62970> Also a very good idea! thanks! <comment247652> I can confirm that the `sudo chflags -h nohidden /etc` command still works in Yosemite - thanks
