Switch off cellular network off/on on iPhone (triggered by Bluetooth car kit) <body> I have a car (Audi A7 with MMI &amp; Bluetooth Mobile Telephone interface) and an iPhone with dual SIM card (2nd SIM is plugged into the car). I would like when my car is started (and my 2nd SIM activates), my iPhone's cellular network would be automatically switched off (no radiation in the car anymore). My bluetooth should still stay on (need that to have my contacts synced with my car). My current day-to-day procedure is the following:  ol liwhen starting the car: manually put the iphone in airplane mode, and then manually switch on bluetooth again (with was also deactivated due to airplane mode)./li liwhen stopping the car: put manually airplane mode off, and make one outgoing call (e.g. voicemail) to activate my 1st dual-sim card again (otherwise my iPhone does not receive calls i noticed)./li /ol  Is there is a way to automate this? Or can I configure a kind of iPhone profile which activates/deactivates airplane mode &amp; bluetooth (to have less manual actions).  <answer99224> On a jailbroken iPhone, with SBProfiles and SBSettings you can utilise profiles to group multiple actions to different situations. The downside is that you have to manually switch the profiles when entering and leaving the car.  ol liMake sure you have SBProfiles and SBSettings installed from Cydia./li liOpen SBProfiles. It should have multiple profiles by default; codeDefault/code and codeCar/code among them. Select codeCar/code and then codeToggles/code. Drag codeAirplane/code and codeBluetooth/code to codeOn/code section. Make sure that codeAirplane/code is on top of codeBluetooth/code, otherwise activation of codeAirplane/code will turn codeBluetooth/code back off./li liThen, go back to codeCar/code and select codeDone/code from the top bar. Select codeDefault/code and then codeToggles/code. Drag codeAirplane/code to codeOff/code section (and codeBluetooth/code, if you don't need it outside the car)./li liSelect codeSettings/code from the bottom tabs. Select codeActivation Method(s)/code under codeProfile Switching/code. Here you can select the action(s) that trigger the profile selection to become active. I think it defaults to codeShort Hold/code of the codeSleep Button/code./li /ol  Now, when you hold the codeSleep Button/code a bit longer than shutting down the screen but not long enough to power off the iPhone, you can select codeCar/code profile and have cellular turned on but Bluetooth on. Or select codeDefault/code to turn cellular back on. I think you will have to make the call still, unless there's a way to automate it, too.  <comment116497> I suspect doing this this is not possible with an unjailbroken iPhone, but I am not 100% sure.
