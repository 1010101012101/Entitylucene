headless ssh key password from keychain <body> On MacOS 10.12 Sierra (or/and OS X 10.11 EI Capitan) how can one use the passwords for ssh keys stored in the keychain headless?  If one ssh-es in and left a local session running one can see ssh-agent is available   precodelaunchctl list | grep ssh ps ax | grep ssh-agent /code/pre  and can be used by setting SSH_AUTH_SOCK correctly  precodeSSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(ls -t1 /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd*/Listeners | head -n 1 ); export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; /code/pre  But as soon as the local user logs out the remote session can't use an ssh-agent backed by keychain anymore (no output for the first 2 commands). I tried;  precodesudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openssh.ssh-agent.plist /code/pre  but it fails to help, and  precodeeval "$(ssh-agent -l)" /code/pre  fails with codelaunch_activate_socket(): No such process/code, and  precodeeval "$(ssh-agent)" /code/pre  fails to connect to the existing socket code/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.*/Listeners/code instead using code/var/folders/*/*/T/ssh-*/agent.*/code.  precodesecurity login-keychain /code/pre  outputs code/Users/*/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db/code regardless. It might be possible to trigger a local login but I want to avoid that.  <comment350308> Did you already find a solution for that? <comment350440> @AlexanderRemesch locking the screen instead of logout is the only workaround I know of.
