How to disable face detection in Photos for OS X <body> I don't like the feature that automatically detects faces in Photos for OS X because of the unnecessary CPU and disk space consumption. A photo library of 360 MB generated 50 MB of face detection data inside the Photos Library.  Is there any way to disable this feature in Photos for OS X?  <answer182574> Unfortunately, you can only side-step the issue by clicking the Albums tab  Faces, and select each found face &amp; delete it. You cannot bulk select, so this must be done manually for each face.  You should log an enhancement request (or three) at the Photos Feedback page.  <answer201796> Apparently you can stop face recognition by quitting iPhotos,  opening a terminal and typing the following (and press enter):  precodedefaults write com.apple.iPhoto PKFaceDetectionEnabled 0 /code/pre  I guess you'll then need to manually delete all the faces it's recognised thus far.  As for the new "Photos" app, I don't think you can disable the face detection.  <answer238465> View  Hide Face Names  View  Hide Face Names  View  Hide Face Names  View  Hide Face Names  View  Hide Face Names  <answer267513> Here is how to remove the "unnamed" for each face in Mac Photos. Just open Photos and select View and click on "HIDE FACE NAMES"  <answer282031> in search type 'face0'  all the faces will come up.  then select all and delete.     <comment217457> Thanks for the feedback link! I've done a quick test here and it looks like deleting a face does not free disk space (at least not immediately). I logged an enhancement request and hope the Photos team come up with a solution soon! <comment217533> After removing faces from the Faces album, I then opened `Photos Library.photoslibrary` as a package and deleted the faces.db file. Now, after importing images with faces, the faces.db file is not recreated and there is no Faces album. Perhaps this is a way to turn it off? <comment292470> Welcome to Ask Different.  While it's good to answer questions it's not necessary to repeat the same answer multiple times.  The OP might not appreciate the answer and/or not mark it as correct, impacting your reputation.  For info on how to answer questions, see this: [answer].  - From Review - <comment292501> The minimal length constraints for answers are there for a reason. Instead of repeating the same text several times to work around it, adding a bit of additional explanation might make the answer easier to read. <comment335680> This really does not answer the question posed, which seeks to remove the face detection data, not merely hide the names.
