Playlist of favorites songs <body> Is it possible to create a playlist on a iPhone with iOS 9 of all the favorite songs (by marking favorite with the heart icon)  <answer214545> Create in iTunes a smart playlists of loved songs, and the playlist will be updated on the iPhone. If you mark a song as loved it will be added to the playlist without syncing.  <comment252406> With iTunes there may be a way to create a Smart Playlist.
