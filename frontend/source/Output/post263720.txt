Airdropped files are read-only on Sierra <body> I frequently use AirDrop to share an iPhone image with my Mac. But on Sierra now, this is partially broken. If I try to edit the image in Preview, such as a resize, the image is immediately changed to a "copy" filename, and I get the warning you see in the screenshot.  If I check permissions using Cmd-I, I'm listed as having Read-Write access on the file. I also have Read-Write on the Downloads folder where Airdrop files go by default.  I always have to browse back for the same filename, and it lets me overwrite it, so why can't I just edit and save it in place?! Any suggestions appreciated here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ifWjJ.png" alt="screenshot"
