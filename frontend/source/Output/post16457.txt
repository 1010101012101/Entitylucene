Photoshop CS5 and Wacom - all menus grayed when App focus changed <body> Occasionally, when I switch (via kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⇥ Tab/kbd or Expose) from Photoshop to another App then back - all of the Photoshop menu items are grayed (inactive state). You can still issue hotkey commands like kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbdO/kbd, kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbdW/kbd, etc.  This doesn't happen every time I switch apps, but I haven't noticed a specific action that causes it to happen consistently.   hr  OSX 10.6.7 Photoshop CS5 12.0 x64 Wacom Intuos 2 (I only mention this, because it emseems/em like it only happens when using wacom tools mouse/pen)  <comment18000> I'm pretty sure this has happened to me too, but has stoped lateley. Anyone? Im on an iMac 2010 with 10.6.7 too.
