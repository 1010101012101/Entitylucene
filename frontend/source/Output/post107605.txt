How can I display the format bar above the document in Pages 5.0? <body> The new version of Pages has the format bar (i.e. the bar where you change the font size, typeface, alignment, spacing, etc.) on the right of the document:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/US5Nz.png" alt="Pages 5.0"  I want it to be on the top of the document like in Pages 4.3 (Pages '09):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BG3H5.png" alt="Pages 4.3"  How can I accomplish this?  <answer110354> strongThis is not possible in Pages 5.0./strong  If your wish for a format bar above the document outweighs any benefit from Pages 5.0, you can continue to use iWork '09.  You can also notify Apple that you would like this feature implemented using their Pages feedback page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html/li /ul  <comment129770> No, you can do nothing.  At least until 5.01,  or reverting to '09. <comment129940> Good question, I tried to do this, too. My research resulted in that there's no possibility to do that yet... hopefully Apple adds it in later updates... <comment129948> Sorry I do not know the solution...but this arrangement is absolutely comfortable to me! In future versions Apple may please see that this is not removed. <comment130829> I sent Apple a feature request via the feedback page you linked. Hopefully they will ameliorate this annoying issue soon. Thank you for your answer! <comment141089> I don't mind having the format bar in the right during normal editing mode, but for full-screen mode it's absolutely crucial. A 'dark'/night mode for fullscreen is definitely necessary as well.
