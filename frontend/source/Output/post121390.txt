How to restore my deleted .bash_profile? <body> I have deleted my .bash_profile with rm command and copied another one to use. But now i remember there is some PATH thing in the previous file :(. Can i find the deleted .bash_profile in some place like Trash?  <answer121403> When you do coderm/code on a file, it is immediately unlinked from the file system and gone for good.   The Trash is a Finder Idiom that is not available in a unix terminal session. The only way to restore your file is by restoring it from a backup.  <comment141488> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26028/how-do-i-restore-my-bash-profile <comment141495> Possible recovery by /etc/skel/.bash_profile <comment141511> Can't you recover it from your backup? <comment141533> @Buscarì›ƒ i can not find skel folder under /etc :( <comment141535> you means if there is no backup, then cannot restore it? <comment141536> @patrix no backup:(. <comment141556> No. It is (most probably) gone. The data may still be on the disk, but then we are talking data recovery. This in turn will only yield a result if the disk was taken offline immediately. If it was written to for an extended time the data will have been overwritten by new data.
