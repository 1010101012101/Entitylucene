Multiple Bluetooth Speakers <body> 1) Is it possible to output the audio over a2dp to multiple speakers simultaneously?br 2) Is it possible to change the audio output to A2DP speakers directly from iTunes or do I have to change the system preferences every time?  Thanks.  <answer14298> 1) I think it's dependand on the speaker set you're using, but I don't think so.  2) No, you can change your audio output in a simpler way:  ol liHit kbdAlt/kbd resp. kbdOption/kbd/li liClick on the volume icon/li liSelect your input/output sources  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RvMm0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <answer125044> Try using Audio MIDI Setup, it's in the Utilities folder.  ol liFrom the list of devices on the left, just click on the plus icon at the bottom left of the list./li liSelect "Create multi-output device"/li liAdd the different bluetooth gadgets to this new "device"/li /ol  To rename the device, right-click on it once it's in the list and call it something memorable.
