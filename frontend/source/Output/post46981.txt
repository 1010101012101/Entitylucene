App or process to show Youtube videos offline without a computer? <body> I'm trying to avoid having to sync my iOS devices with a computer for any reason, but so far haven't been able to come up with a way to find a youtube video and cache it locally so when I leave an internet connected area I can still view it.  The methods to do it that are most common all involve a computer:  Saving online videos (e.g. YouTube) and moving them to iPad for later offline viewing?  Is there an app, or a process I can follow, that will cache youtube videos on the iOS device for viewing in a slow internet situation, or away from internet access?  <answer46982> Video Downloader Pro Lite is the app you're looking for.     To begin a download:      ul   liBrowse on the web./li   liSelect any video on any website,/li   liClick download./li   /ul   It works pretty well for me!  <answer60344> I'm using FoxTube for caching many youtube videos for offline viewing, and I just love the app. iPhone version http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foxtube-youtube-cache/id486365960?mt=8 iPad version http://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/foxtube-hd-youtube-cache/id491640360?mt=8  <comment54089> Are you open to Windows software, Mac software, software as a service or do you want answers to be narrow to one particular OS running the capture software? <comment76948> Welcome to Ask Different!
