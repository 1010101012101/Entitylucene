How can I attach a contact replying an email on Iphone with IOS7 <body> I have not found a way to share a contact with someone that requested it by e-mail, I should be able to reply with an attached contact information, does anyone know how to do this?  <answer121621> You can send your Contact card via emai from the Contacts app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Wb28.png" alt="enter image description here"  The above was for Mac contacts, in your case for the iPhone there is a share contact with the same functions.  Share Contacts From Your iPhone Or iPad:  Open Contacts Tap on a contact that you wish to share. Scroll down and tap Share Contact.  You have three share options:  Airdrop (use only to share with other ios7)  Message  Mail  Choose the option you like, fill in the addressee details, and click Send.  <comment348225> Since the question is about replying with a vCard attachment, after following @Buscarì›ƒ's instructions, simply copy the **vcf** file and paste it into your reply. It's not as straightforward as it should be, but it's definitely possible.
