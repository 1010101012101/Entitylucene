Corrupt timezone in iCloud calendar <body> Somehow the timezone definitions in my iCal data got corrupted. When I download a shared calendar from iCloud, it contains this spurious timezone definition:  precodeBEGIN:VTIMEZONE TZID:Europe/… X-LIC-LOCATION:Europe/… BEGIN:STANDARD DTSTART:18500101T000000 RDATE;VALUE=DATE-TIME:18500101T000000 TZNAME:PMT TZOFFSETFROM:+5744 TZOFFSETTO:+5744 END:STANDARD BEGIN:STANDARD DTSTART:18911001T000000 RDATE;VALUE=DATE-TIME:18911001T000000 TZNAME:CEST TZOFFSETFROM:+5744 TZOFFSETTO:+0100 END:STANDARD … /code/pre  The time zone offset of "+5744" is obviously invalid, and the library I use for parsing this information rightly complains about it. (I generate timesheets for my work from a calendar.)  I've fixed this in my local data, but that means I have to export the code.ics/code file manually to process it. Is there a way to either:  ol liAutomate exporting an code.ics/code calendar from iCal? (I tried Automator and poking around the AppleScript dictionary for iCal but didn't find anything.)/li liUpload the fixed timezone definitions to iCloud; or nuke all calendar data in iCloud and restore from exports?/li /ol  I tried deleting just the shared calendar in iCal, and creating it from scratch, but the corruption remains - the time zone definitions don't seem to be tied to the calendar.  In case it's relevant, I have "time zone support" disabled in iCal.  <comment65578> How are these events created? <comment65580> @Gerry They're not events, it's a record that specifies when DST is observed in a timezone. I have no idea how they got there, iCal definitely doesn't let you edit those by GUI. (My guess is they're just excerpted from the Olson DB; if I tampered with that it wasn't knowingly.) I only noticed this because my timesheet script started blowing up.
