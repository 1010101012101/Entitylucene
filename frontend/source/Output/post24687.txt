Disable "...application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?" on certain file types? <body> Is it possible to modify which files Apple's quarantine warning pops up on?  Specifically I download hundreds of PHP files (web developer) and I'm tired of seeing "...is a script application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?"  I don't mind the warning on most downloads, but don't want warnings on scripts I'm opening to edit.  FYI, Quarantine can be completly disabled with:     defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO and can be removed from existing files with:     xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ~/emfoldername/em  <answer24689> If you download files from the internet into the code~/Downloads/code folder, you could assign a folder action to code~/Downloads/code via Automator:  Open Automator Create a new Folder Action  As the action, drag over "Run Shell Script"  Assign the following shell script:  precode    for f in "$@"     do         test "$f" == *\.php &amp;&amp; xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine $f     done /code/pre  <answer52102> Building from @Daniel's answer, you could do this from a shell:  precodefind /path/to/your/app -name '*.php' -exec xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine {} \; /code/pre  <comment27726> Hmm this might work, but the problem isn't files going to /Downloads, it's all my Git repos and sites.  I could set it up to run on those folders recursively I suppose.  /Downloads is actually the one places I'd like to it run.
