Digital signage software for Samsung display with embedded media player <body> I'm looking for software to drive a large monitor, ideally in portrait mode, to display announcements of events and associated images for public viewing.  Only the large display is publically viewable, the Mac will be racked in a secured room with a network connection and an HDMI cable and a Cat5E cable to the monitor.  I think this is often called digital signage.  If the display has an embedded media player like the Samsung OH46F, what Mac software could be used to drive it?  Mac mini running macOS Sierra 10.12.4  <comment357751> Welcome to Ask Different!  See [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for important guidelines that should be followed when asking for a software recommendation. It will help everyone by preventing unnecessary answers for items that don't fit your request. <comment357805> It's hard to tell *exactly* what you're after - it could depend on update type & frequency, but I actually think hanging a mac off the back of it is overkill. There are screens that play from SD, ones with NVRAM, ones with wifi or ethernet capability for remote update, touch-screen or not. There are entire suites of interactive software built-in, for such as the "show me my living room using your wallpaper/paint" type in-store displays. The company I work for makes one that you can update from templates in your iPhone [can't post as a recommendation, not sure that would be acceptable]. <comment357806> contd... Unfortunately, once you remove the Mac from the setup, it becomes off-topic for this site - but there's a lot of stuff out there to choose from, few of which start with a 'consumer monitor & regular computer'. I would highly recommend finding a company who specialise. <comment358331> This is meant for use by a church to show events and announcements.  They are cost-sensitive (no surprise) and were thinking about a Mac mini solution so they had flexibility for changing the display application at some point.  And the ability to remotely update the content with some authentication.  Will look into ongoing support costs from a specializing company. <comment358448> If you were willing to use the rather manual, 'change an SD card' solution, you could get the whole thing for half the price of a mini, screen included. I'd talk to the specialists first, rather than purchase a system they probably have no support for.
