Does Apple allows restricting In-App Purchase DLC Non-Consumable Content to one device? <body> I have been reading the review guideline: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/  I see section about for subscription its has to be available for all iOS devices of a single user:  Content subscriptions using IAP must last a minimum of 7 days and be available to the user from all of their iOS devices.  But does that apply to Non-Consumable Content as well? I am worry Apple will reject our app because of this reason.  <answer241909> You are afraid Apple will reject your app because you use non-consumable content on only one device?   One of my project has in-app purchases only for 1 device. The app is already 6 years continuously reviewed and successfully deployed. Believe me, this is not an issue aslong you are not using a subscription.   The only problem you are facing is someone can buy the DLC also on a other device and it will auto unlock as it has already been purchased with the same Apple ID. There are ways to prevent this by securing your app via a database.  <comment297325> @rwzdoom You just saved my day!  How did you prevent DLC being used by other device?  The only way I can think of now is to track their VendorID and tie the VendorID with the DLC receipt transaction id... <comment297326> Your welcome @KingChan . We created some UDID from the device and the account of the user is only accessible per 1 device. <comment297452> @rwzdoom I wonder how do you handle multiple account (i.e. Facebook login)?  If the user user login with different facebook account, then is a completely different account with DLC they should be able to restore? <comment297454> We don't accept switching accounts and retrieving a DLC (it's 1 user 1 buy, not 2 users 1 buy way). Why would anyone want to switch Facebook accounts and use the same DLC?
