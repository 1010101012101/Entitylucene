I can't re-download a song with iTunes on my PC or iPhone <body> I bought an album yesterday from iTunes on my PC, downloaded it, and synced it with my iPhone.  When I later tried to play the songs on the phone, I noticed that they wouldn't play at all.  I also noticed that they wouldn't play on the PC.  So, I tried to follow the suggestion in this other question and deleted the songs, thinking I could just re-download them.  I can't seem to actually re-download these.  ol liI locate the album in the iTunes store from iTunes on my PC./li liI click "buy" for the album./li liI see a pop-up box from iTunes telling me I have already purchased this item and can redownload it from my Purchases.  /li liI click the "Purchased" button on the pop-up dialog./li liiTunes takes me to "Purchased" screen, but I do not see the artist or any of the songs from that artist in my purchased music list./li /ol  Also, when I try to download it from iTunes directly from my iPhone, the album shows up with a "purchased" box next to it already and is unclickable.  I am using iTunes 11 on my PC and have iOS 6.0.1 on the iPhone.  How can I get this music?  <answer134765> I had this exact same problem and I tried the same solution you did: deleted the file and could not redownload. It just said "Purchased" and there was no option to redownload. It turns out that I must have selected to "hide" the purchase. I fixed this by going to my account settings in itunes and clicking "view hidden purchases". Low and behold, my missing file was there. I clicked the "unhide" button and was able to download it again from the itunes store.  <answer232856> I found the solution!  You have to go back to iTunes and instead of going to the album, go to the songs it previews right below it. The missing songs will have the "buy $???" Option. You need to select that option, and once you do it will say you have already purchased it and will ask if you want to download again for free. Say yes and your missing song(s) will download.  Repeat step for all other missing songs individually.  <comment88970> I donâ€™t know how to solve this, but if you are not able to solve it by following future answers, contact Apple Support and they will refund you. Buy the album again. <comment94920> Please read this [support article](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1408?viewlocale=en_US) by Apple.
