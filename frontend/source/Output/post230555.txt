Keyboard unresponsive out of nothing <body> I have an old 13” MBP (Early 2011) which I use regularly but just a few minutes per day.  Today I came back home - MBP was turned on and charging - and keyboard just doesn’t seem to work.  Some keys (codeA/code, codeD/code, codeS/code) do seem to work, but the rest of the keyboard is unresponsive. The very bad sign is that, by pressing codeJ/code it actually writes stuff like codeadsssadsa/code.  ul liI couldn’t do any of the standard suggestions (reset PRAM or SMC). The shortcuts just don’t work, so that the machine turns on as if I wasn’t pressing any key./li liWhile codeD/code works (when MBP is turned on), I was not able to enter the Apple Hardware Test. Any idea why?/li liAs read somewhere, I run codekextstat -kl | awk ' !/apple/ { print $6 } ‘/code to identify problematic apps, but nothing was printed/li /ul  Now to me this emreally/em looks like a liquid damage, but I am more than 100% sure that nothing happened. Could this be explained / solved in some other way, do you have any suggestion, other than going to the closest apple store?   I surely will, but it’s not so close and I’ll be able to go only next week.  <comment281424> Could possibly be a swollen battery. Have you tried an external USB keyboard? <comment281449> To just verify if it has got to do something to do with the software or hardware, can try using an external keyboard and let me know
