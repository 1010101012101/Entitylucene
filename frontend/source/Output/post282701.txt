Scrolling in Terminal when program is opened in MacOS Sierra <body> After I upgraded to Sierra from Mavericks I noticed that when I open something in Terminal with for example codeless/code or codevi/code and I want to scroll back to see previous lines the scrolling happens inside the programs. How can I change it back to 'just scroll'?  Thanks!  <answer282702> You can scroll the screen while holding kbdfn/kbd or kbdShift ⇧/kbd key.   You can disable this completly by unthicking:  strongTerminal Preferences/strong → strongProfiles/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongScroll Alternate Screen/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dnj0y.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment356294> This happens in El Captain as well.
