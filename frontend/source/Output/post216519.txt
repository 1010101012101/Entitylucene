What is "ss_conn_service " running on OS X? <body> I'm using OS X El Capitan on iMac 21.5". As an experienced user, I follow activity monitor sometimes for security of my device. For 2-3 days,"strongss_conn_service/strong" is running on my device. I cannot determine what the process do. I suspect from a Galaxy Tab which I plugged to my device 2-3 days ago. Did you encountered with this process ?   strongSample of the process obtained from Activity Monitor:/strong     Analysis of sampling ss_conn_service (pid 62) every 1 millisecond   Process:         ss_conn_service [62] Path:br   /Library/LaunchAgents/ss_conn_service Load Address:    0x100000000   Identifier:      ss_conn_service Version:         ???

I would recommend doing this for small time periods when you don't think much is changing. Typically, thousands of files change each hour - so you'll need to get used to weeding out the "false" positives.  <answer216527> I delete it from code/Library/LaunchAgents/code. Now, everything is going well. I don't encountered any problem right now. Thanks for answers.  <comment261675> A Google search shows it to be the Samsung USB Driver for Mobile Phones. <comment261677> Yes. However, search reports show only Windows driver information. Is there any drawback available for deleting this app from system ? <comment261679> I would look at the .plist files in `/Library/LaunchAgents` to see the one that's loading "ss_conn_service" and see what the path to the "ss_conn_service" executable is.  This might provide additional information to help determine the source.  As to deleting it, if it is for your phone then if you don't plan on connecting your phone to the computer again then deleting it shouldn't hurt. <comment261682> Welcome to Ask Different. I'm going to assume there is an implied question here "How can I tell what package installed X" - if you have another question, you could ask a follow on question or edit this one.
