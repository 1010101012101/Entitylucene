CMD+Left Arrow, CMD+Right Arrow -- Jump Word <body> I've switched my kbdCtrl/kbd and kbdCmd/kbd key to replicate my hotkeys on Windows. I've fixed my home and end keys to behave as I'd like and now all that's left is remapping my kbdCmd/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbdCmd/kbd+kbd→/kbd to behave properly.  So far - tried a bunch of things suggested on StackOverflow and really can't get it to work. I've tried:    ul liPossible to move the cursor word-by-word with Cmd+left/right instead of Alt+left/right? (accepted answer and KeyBindingsEditor program).  /li liThe following in my code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code (from http://heisencoder.net/2008/04/fixing-up-mac-key-bindings-for-windows.html):  precode{ "\UF729"   = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";                       /* Home         */ "@\UF729"  = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:";                   /* Cmd  + Home  */ "$\UF729"  = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:";     /* Shift + Home */ "@$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfDocumentAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Cmd  + Home */ "\UF72B"   = "moveToEndOfLine:";                             /* End          */ "@\UF72B"  = "moveToEndOfDocument:";                         /* Cmd  + End   */ "$\UF72B"  = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:";           /* Shift + End  */ "@$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfDocumentAndModifySelection:";       /* Shift + Cmd  + End */ "\UF72C"   = "pageUp:";                                      /* PageUp       */ "\UF72D"   = "pageDown:";                                    /* PageDown     */ "$\UF728"  = "cut:";                                         /* Shift + Del  */ "$\UF727"  = "paste:";                                       /* Shift + Ins */ "@\UF727"  = "copy:";                                        /* Cmd  + Ins  */ "$\UF746"  = "paste:";                                       /* Shift + Help */ "@\UF746"  = "copy:";                                        /* Cmd  + Help (Ins) */ "@\UF702"  = "moveWordBackward:";                            /* Cmd  + LeftArrow */ "@\UF703"  = "moveWordForward:";                             /* Cmd  + RightArrow */ "@$\UF702" = "moveWordBackwardAndModifySelection:";   /* Shift + Cmd  + Leftarrow */ "@$\UF703" = "moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:";   /* Shift + Cmd  + Rightarrow */ } /code/pre/li /ul  Any ideas why this won't work for me?  <answer189174> I know that you are trying to do this via KeyBindings, but here is an alternative method using Keyboard Maestro:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zX4X4.png" alt="Keyboard Maestro to remap keys"  <comment223364> So, do you want a fix, or do you want to know why your described method is not working? <comment223620> @CousinCocaine A fix would be preferred. <comment223739> Looked at Karabiner? https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en <comment224773> Both options work for me. I even did a straight copy from your posted code. Remember for the effects to take place you must logout and back in. <comment224774> @markhunte That is interesting. Can I double-check? To test it, did you switched the CTRL and CMD key as described and saved the dict to ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict , logged out and back in and now you can jump words with CMD-arrow? <comment224775> Yes that is correct. I copied the exact code you have posted. And I also did the same for the code in the other answer. CMD+ arrows jumped words instead of to ends. <comment224779> @markhunte Thanks for the heads-up. (I'm not the OP but just interested).  So that would mean that the error is somewhere else - assuming that the OP has logged out and back in since the file has been edited. So basically this is new and useful information for the OP. <comment225210> @markhunte Yeah -- no dice for me. I've logged out and back in. I wonder if it's because I'm using a Microsoft keyboard. <comment225211> That is possible, only one way to find out..
