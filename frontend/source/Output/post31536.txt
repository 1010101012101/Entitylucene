How to check the location of installed files when using Installer on Mac 10.6.7 <body> I am installing a C++ library using the Installer application(its a .mpkg file)  The installation is successful, but I cannot find the location of the library to set an environmental variable. I have checked the /private/var/log/install.log, but the destination folder is not listed.  Is there another log I can check, or a way to determine the installation destination through the .mpkg?  Thank you very much for your time,  Adam  <answer31546> You should be able to view the details of what was installed using codepkgutil/code.   You can use codepkgutil --packages/code to get the exact name of the package and then codepkgutil --files package/code to see what files were installed.  <answer31587> precode$ cd ~/Desktop/InsomniaT.mpkg/Contents/Resources/Kernel\ Module.pkg/Contents/ $ ls Archive.bom    Archive.pax.gz Info.plist     PkgInfo        Resources $ lsbom Archive.bom .   41775   0/80 ./System    40755   0/0 ./System/Library    40755   0/0 ./System/Library/Extensions 40755   0/0 ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext  40755   0/0 ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext/Contents 40755   0/0 ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext/Contents/Info.plist  100644  0/0 1900    1578584638 ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext/Contents/MacOS   40755   0/0 ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext/Contents/MacOS/InsomniaT 100644  0/0 107860  966116348 $ gzip -cd Archive.pax.gz | pax | more . ./System ./System/Library ./System/Library/Extensions ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext/Contents ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext/Contents/Info.plist ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext/Contents/MacOS ./System/Library/Extensions/InsomniaT.kext/Contents/MacOS/InsomniaT $  /code/pre  <answer31588> Use codepkgutil --pkg-info packageid/code and look for the listed "location" to see where the installation root was; then codepkgutil --files packageid/code will show the installed files emrelative to/em that root location.  <answer31622> Simply open the package with the standard OS X Installer, and hit âŒ˜I (or through menus: FileShow files).  For more information or to act upon the files, use the excellent Pacifist package manager.  <comment36176> that command just gives me the package names, not their destination <comment36200> This only works on old-style (bundle-based) packages, and only shows the file paths relative to the installation root, and if the installation root wasn't "/"...
