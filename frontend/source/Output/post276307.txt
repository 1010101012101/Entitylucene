Installing Elf on Mac through homebrew <body> I am trying to compile an Android kernel on my Mac (El Capitan). It needs to include a certain "elf.h" header file. It is not clear to me yet what this file exactly is, and I apologise for that; anyway, what I ask now is: how to install it?  I tried codebrew install libelf/code, but this only installs a gelf.h, and had a look at elflang on github (https://github.com/elflang), but there are two options in this repository, none of which seems to include an elf.h  <answer276308> Try the one from dtrace that apple ships  precodehttps://opensource.apple.com/source/dtrace/dtrace-96/sys/elf.h /code/pre  <answer276309> A different approach compared to user2707001's answer is outlined here: [GUIDE] Building Android Kernel on OSX:  Here you create the file elf.h yourself by copying the whole snippet below, pasting it into the Terminal window and hitting the kbdEnter/kbd key:  precodecat &lt;&lt;EOT &gt;&gt; /usr/local/include/elf.h #include "../opt/libelf/include/libelf/gelf.h" #define R_386_NONE 0 #define R_386_32 1 #define R_386_PC32 2 #define R_ARM_NONE 0 #define R_ARM_PC24 1 #define R_ARM_ABS32 2 #define R_MIPS_NONE 0 #define R_MIPS_16 1 #define R_MIPS_32 2 #define R_MIPS_REL32 3 #define R_MIPS_26 4 #define R_MIPS_HI16 5 #define R_MIPS_LO16 6 #define R_IA64_IMM64 0x23 /* symbol + addend, mov imm64 */ #define R_PPC_ADDR32 1 /* 32bit absolute address */ #define R_PPC64_ADDR64 38 /* doubleword64 S + A */ #define R_SH_DIR32 1 #define R_SPARC_64 32 /* Direct 64 bit */ #define R_X86_64_64 1 /* Direct 64 bit */ #define R_390_32 4 /* Direct 32 bit. */ #define R_390_64 22 /* Direct 64 bit. */ #define R_MIPS_64 18 EOT /code/pre  This will create a new shim-file /usr/local/include/elf.h only containing the lines starting with a code#/code  <answer276312> I have been lucky and found quickly a solution, it seems. The elf.h is specific for Linux systems (I think). But somebody managed to adapt it to Mac OS X:  https://gist.github.com/mlafeldt/3885346  Just pasting that file into code/usr/local/include//code allowed me to successfully compile. (To be honest I still have to test the result, but the compilation ended successfully.)  <comment347699> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19434721/elf-h-file-not-found-error-when-compiling-android-kernel-for-nexus-7-on-mac-os <comment347700> This would not work, as stated in the question you link. Also I don't have that path in my system. <comment347701> Not a nice approach. I had already seen this guide. There's also a related post here on AskDifferent, although I don't have the link handy. <comment347702> If you have seen a lot, put that in your question please. <comment347703> @user2707001 You have to prepend an (at) to Enrico's name to address him or he won't get notified of your comment (in a comment only one (at) is allowed so you have to use the "real (at)" and not (at)) ;-) <comment347795> @Enrico : updated
