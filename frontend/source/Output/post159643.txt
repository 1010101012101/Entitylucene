Isolate Mac & Windows sharing parallels <body> I am using parallel desktop. Before I installed parallels drivers both were isolated. Now all my folders are shared with Mac and Windows mutually. I can't simply uninstall the drivers because drivers fixed my windows resolution. Now, I am running Windows on Retina Display.

Sharing drivers is still their.   <answer159651> Open your Windows VM and go to Actions - Configure... in the menubar  Choose the Options-tab and highligt codeSharing/code in the left pane  Uncheck all boxes like in the picture below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CL09k.jpg" alt="sharing"  Hit the codeCustom Folders.../code Button and remove any user-defined OS X folder by highlighting it and clicking the kbd-/kbd button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Qo4U.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
