AirDrop issue with Macbook Pro and new iPhone <body> I'm having an issue with my Macbook and a new iPhone 7 I just ugpraded to (from an 6S plus).  With my 6S plus, AirDrop always worked flawlessly, however, with my new iPhone 7, I can ONLY send to my macbook book (which asks me whether I want to Accept or Decline -- something that didn't happen before with my 6S plus).  My Macbook cannot send to my iPhone 7 at all.  I have followed this article (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204144) thoroughly, and have also tried rebooting both devices, toggling the wifi/bluetooth on booth, and I also tried signing out of my iCloud account on my Macbook, then signing back in, but to no avail.  I would think, that since I'm signed in to iCloud on both devices (especially according to the article I mentioned above), that this should just work.  Any ideas?
