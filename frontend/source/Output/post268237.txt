Mac freezes at startup at apple logo after permission changes <body> I executed  precodechmod go-rwx / /code/pre  Command on my Macbook pro yosemite. Since then its not able to boot up. It just sticks at apple logo.  Things I have tried:  ul liMac repair   Disk Utility  Repair file permissions. Completed Ok./li liMac repair  Disk Utility   Repair Disk. Completed Ok./li liPressed (Cmnd+S) during boot  fsck -fy . The volume appears to be Ok./li liPressed (Cmnd+S) during boot  verified permissions of all folders inside the / with another mac book of same specs. All were same./li /ul  Am I only left with re-install ?  Ps: I got that command from here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6419695  <answer268239> Assuming you didn't change ownership (users/groups) but instead only changed the permissions...  Try issuing the command:  codechmod 1775 //code   <answer268304> Here's how I fixed it:  ol liBoot into strongSingle User mode/strong. ( Press Cmnd+S during start up )/li liRan codefsck -fy/code successfully./li liMounted code//code in read-write mode using codemount -uw //code so that I can edit permissions on it./li liExecuted codechmod go+x //code/li liContinued system boot by typing codeexit/code, voila! it all worked./li /ol  <comment336651> Why did you run that on the *root* directory? That was talking about setting permissions for an apache folder. You're likely borked. <comment336654> I am betting you had to issue the command `sudo chmod....` because only the root user can issue that command to that directory.  This should have been a flag that you are doing something "dangerous." <comment336655> I thought  'For each parent directory leading to your web root' included everything, including / <comment336658> "For each parent directory leading to..."  Not every directory leads to your web directory now, does it? <comment336663> @AtulVaibhav when copying shell commands from the interwebs, *copy them exactly*. Don't modify them unless you know what you're doing. Typing `sudo rm -rf /` for example will *delete your entire system*. As Allan suggested, use `sudo`-requiring commands with care. <comment336812> My project root directory is `/Library/WebServer/Documents/avp` so I thought `/` , `/Library`,  `/Library/WebServer` , `/Library/WebServer/Documents` and `/Library/WebServer/Documents/avp` were all to be edited.
