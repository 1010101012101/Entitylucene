I am trying to erase and reformat drive with snow leopard, but don't have the install DVD <body> I have a 2009 MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard, and I'm selling it to someone. Want to erase and reformat the drive but I don't have the Snow Leopard Install DVD. Is there any way to do this?  <answer206316> The Apple Store online sells the Snow Leopard Install DVD for approx. $20.
