Creating A Folder From Any Number Of Selected Items In Finder? <body> Is there a quick way to select several items and place them into a new folder?  <answer100124> Two ways to achieve this:  ol liSelect the files, compress them into a zip, and then uncompress them into a folder that will be named whatever you named the zip in the first place.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ViXsb.gif" width="500"/li liSelect the items you want in the Finder, right-click (or two-finger tap) on them to bring up OS X's contextual menu, and choose the first option: strongNew Folder with Selection/strong (shown in the gif below). The Finder will then create a new folder with those items stored safely inside, removing at least one step from the process for you automatically.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eSvqv.gif" width="500"/li /ol  <answer100146> Finder's File menu has the fastest method to take selected files and make a new nolder with that selection.  ol liSelect the files/li liPress Control + Command + N/li liType the name of the folder/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/35ofO.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you require more sophisticated processing, you could script it as described here: Keyboard Shortcuts for &quot;Compress&quot; or &quot;New Folder with Selection&quot;?  <comment117851> @grgarside Totally awesome !!! <comment117853> The quick way is to assign a keyboard shortcut to finder's **New Folder from Selection** function. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20559/keyboard-shortcuts-for-compress-or-new-folder-with-selection <comment117855> @bmike Apparently you can also use Cntrl+Cmd+N. <comment117857> Now that is even more rapid. I love that I still know so little of all the nooks and crannies of Finder/OS X. I've added that as an answer :-)
