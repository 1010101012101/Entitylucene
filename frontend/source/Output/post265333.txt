To let Finder always open a folder with default window width and height <body> The Finder seems to remember the width and height of window that last time I open that particular folder and set such.  In other words, if I opened a folder and make the window really wide, the next time (after closing it) I open that folder, the window is still very wide.  This remains true even if I restarted computer, and even if I delete the .DS_store inside the root of that folder.   How to let Finder forget all previously-remembered window size of every folder in this computer?  I want that every time I open a new folder, Finder always apply the default size, the setting shipped with MacBook (This is about 1/2 width and 1/2 height of the whole window).   Though this is not big deal, it somewhat annoys me that when I have widened a window for some reason, the next time I open it, I have to manually adjust it back to smaller width and height for ease of reading, or the other way round.  <answer270571> This is extreme, but works: (see also Remove .DS_Store files from Mac OS X)  precodesudo find ~ -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \; /code/pre  Restart and observe that newly opened finder windows are of uniform size. This deletes all ".DS_Store"'s. It then seems that they store relevant data regarding window size.  I did this partly out of curiosity, or maybe I have compulsive personality. I don't recommend normal users to mess up with your computer like this, though.  <comment332681> I have googled, but everyone seems to ask Finder to open a window in _their custom defined_ width, not the default. By the way, some claim that deleting .DS_store in the folder's root makes finder forget window size, but it does not. <comment332756> It may sound crazy (ok maybe I have compulsory personality...) but I have `find ~ -iname "*finder*.plist" | xargs rm` which deletes all preference files having 'finder' within its name. But everything remains the same. I wonder which `plist` does Apple saves the window size in!
