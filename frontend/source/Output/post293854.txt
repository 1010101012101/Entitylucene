Smart Playlist that includes all song that are/were in another playlist <body> I have one emactive/em playlist which contains about 50 songs. But I remove and add songs very commonly at this playlist. I want to have another playlist that includes all song that currently strongare/strong and stronghave been/strong in the emactive/em playlist. Can someone help me to create that smart playlist?  Here is a screenshot of my first attempt but this creates a live updating clone, which is not very helpful. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/41zx7.png" alt="My first try"  <answer293977> iTunes' Smart Playlist feature does not have any memory. You can only refer to songs where/how they are emin this very moment/em.  You can, however, add songs to the new smart playlist that have been played in the last X hours/days.  If you can 'explain' to iTunes how to find the songs that you want to have included/excluded, you can create a smart playlist for it.  Does this answer your question?  <comment371166> I will try out your solution. But are there any other ways outside of iTunes to create Playlist for iTunes? <comment371726> For _regular playlists_ that shall appear in iTunes you have to use a) iTunes on a PC/Mac or b) an iOS device with iTunes Match or c) an iOS device with Apple Music enabled. ## You may also use AppleScript to automate the creation of (smart) playlists.
