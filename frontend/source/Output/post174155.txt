Yosemite Mail "Load Remote Content" from senders in my contacts <body> I would like Mail on Yosemite to load remote content from senders in my contacts and not for everyone else. I have remote content disabled now and I have pieced together an AppleScript to click the button but it doesn't seem to be working. Here's what I have:  precodeusing terms from application "Mail" on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule loadRemoteContent     tell application "Mail"         activate         repeat with eachMessage in theMessages             open eachMessage             tell application "System Events" to tell process "Mail"                 if not (window 1 exists) then return beep 1                 try -- message displayed in a mailbox window                     click button "Load Remote Content" of UI element 1 of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 2 of splitter group 1 of window 1                 end try                 try -- message displayed in a separate mail window                     click button "Load Remote Content" of UI element 1 of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window 1                 end try             end tell         end repeat     end tell end perform mail action with messages end using terms from /code/pre  This script is hooked into a rule in mail were that script is supposed to run when "sender is in contacts"  EDIT: So this is working when I get new mail after allowing Mail to "control my computer using accessibility features" in system preferences. However, I still would like it to work when viewing any message, either one that just came in or one I've had for years.
