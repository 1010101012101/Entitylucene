Fixing multiple Users permissions <body> In a classroom environment after a month without issues all of the sudden everyone is getting locked out of their folders, including my local admin user.  What works is logging into each user, elevated, I may run terminal command:  precodesudo find ~ $TMPDIR.. -exec chflags -h nouchg,nouappnd,noschg,nosappnd {} + -exec chown -h $UID {} + -exec chmod +rw {} + -exec chmod -h -N {} + -type d -exec chmod -h +x {} + 2&gt;&amp;- /code/pre  This is from Linc Davis Repairing permissions when owner is "Fetching..."  So how to use Apple Remote Desktop to fix this via UNIX script?  precode#! /bin/bash  cd /Users  # Create an array with a list of all users in the users folder excluding Shared, site, nc12, and g full=$(ls -1 /Users/ | grep -v 'Shared\|site\|nc12\|g\|.localized') echo Fixing Permissions....  # Loop permissions fix for the values of the array $full for i in $full  {     cd /Users/$i     find ~ $TMPDIR.. -exec chflags -h nouchg,nouappnd,noschg,nosappnd ;     chown -h $UID     chmod -R -N ~ $i     chmod -R 700 $i     chmod -R 777 $i/Public     chmod -R 733 $i/Public/Drop\ Box }  # A reboot shouldn't be necessary since the permissions change instantaneously and will be different the next time a program tries to access files.  # That said, it's never a bad idea to reboot echo "You must REBOOT the machine to complete the process. Thank you." exit /code/pre  What may my syntax errors be? Other suggestions?  <comment254476> Which specific error message are you getting, on which line? And I assume you are aware that your script is not doing the same thing as the find command from above? <comment254716> Possible issues: full is a list not an array and cannot handle spaces in file names. Instead of guessing which files should be excluded in `/Users` , test if the file system object is a valid home folder (`id` and `dscl`  could be used here). Unquoted variables through out the script. Missing escape or quotes in the find command. Missing operand in the `chown` statement. Duplicate operands in the `chmod` statement that strips the ACL's
