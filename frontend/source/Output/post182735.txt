Annoying lag while searching in iOS Safari <body> More or less from iOS 8.2 update I suffer a little, but very annoying, trouble in Safari.  I open Safari, I type in the search bar what I need (web page or something to search on Google) then I've to wait from 5 to 20 seconds to launch the command. Until the table under the search bar is empty, pressing search button doesn't makes happen nothing!  Am I the only one with this issue? Is there a way to solve?  <answer182769> I had the exact same problem! I got the following solution, courtesy of a call to Apple.  ol liGo to Settings  Safari/li liSelect "Clear History and Website Data" (note: this strongwill/strong wipe your history on your phone and any devices that sync their Safari data with your phone's over iCloud./li liChange the Block Cookies setting to Always Block./li liClose Safari from the app switcher./li liChange the Block Cookies setting back to Allow from Websites I Visit./li liEnjoy your non-laggy Safari!/li /ol  <comment217701> Thank you! I didn't thought on history but it's true, searching through an year of history could be a long operation! Unluckly I can't do that because I don't wanna clear my history on Mac so I got to keep my lags! ...do you know how to reduce my history period of time? I remember that was possible but I don't remember how... <comment217714> All my ideas now, no guarantees about anything, but: You could try switching off iCloud Safari on your phone before doing the operation. <comment217875> Yes it works! Is incredible that, without doing the steps 3, 4 and 5, trouble doesn't solve!!
