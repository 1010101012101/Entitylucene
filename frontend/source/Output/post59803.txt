Is it bad to stop the Mountain Lion installer halfway through an install? <body> I already have Mountain Lion.  I started installing it again (it warns you that you already have it).  I realized I don't need to install it again.  The install is halfway finished.  Can I just quit the install, or is it actively overwriting files?     <answer59806> Hmm it appears from a screenshot I received Mountain Lion was only downloading and not actually installing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LXu5q.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The solution is to:  ol liCheck for unfinished downloads/li liIt will reload everything telling you it's all installed already/li liThe download will reset/li /ol  Done!
