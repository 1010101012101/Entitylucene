Have the tab to display the page name, instead of the bookmark's name <body> With Safari, when I open a page by clicking on a bookmark in the Favorites bar, the name of the tab is set to the name of the bookmark, instead of the HTML title of the page.  How can I get Safari to display the original page title in the tab? I need this as the page displays changing information within its title.  <comment331527> I can't reproduce the behavior here. Does it happen with all pages/sites or only with some? May this be rather a question about how to write the correct HTML code? <comment331534> @patrix Ok, so I've tried to reproduce it and actually I only get the bug when I first create a new empty tab and then click on the bookmark. If I open the bookmark within a tab that already has a page displayed in it I get the correct title, very strange...
