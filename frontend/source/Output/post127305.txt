Run the Single User mode with rEFIt installed <body> I recently installed rEFIt boot for a small linux partition. I then tried to boot up into single user mode by hitting {COMMAND + S}, but rEFIts own terminal came up.   Is there any way to still get into single user mode while rEFIt boot is installed?  <answer127312> Figured it out, have to press strongF2/strong when I am in the rEFIt menu, and then select strongSingle USER mode/strong
