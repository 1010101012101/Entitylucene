Trackpad on MacBook Air not responding <body> The Trackpad on my 2013 MacBook Air keeps going in and out.  Restarting the computer corrects the problem, albeit briefly.  How can I figure out why this happens?  <comment343730> Have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257)?  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  Did you have any liquid spill or damage?  Also, take a look at this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/235514/119271)
