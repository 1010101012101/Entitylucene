Problem installing rpm using macports <body> I am trying to install the rpm package using MacPorts, but this is what I get:  precode~ wdb$ sudo port install rpm ---&gt;  Computing dependencies for rpm Error: org.macports.activate for port rpm returned: error renaming  "/opt/local/var/macports/build/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_sysutils_rpm/rpm/work/destroot/opt/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rpm"  to  "/opt/local/var/macports/build/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_sysutils_rpm/rpm/work/destroot/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rpm": no such file or directory  Please see the log file for port rpm for details: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_sysutils_rpm/rpm/main.log To report a bug, follow the instructions in the guide:     http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets Error: Processing of port rpm failed ~ wdb$  /code/pre  What is the exact problem? How can I fix it?  <answer55207> This is a bug in the rpm port. I have filed bug report 35048 for you. I've also listed a workaround there and described how the maintainer of the port can fix it so the workaround is no longer needed.  The workaround is to install from source:  precodesudo port -f uninstall rpm sudo port clean rpm sudo port -s install rpm /code/pre  <comment62755> Just a sanity check.  Did you assure that your ports install has been updated with `port selfupdate`etc? <comment62763> @ephsmith yes, I did. <comment63245> I would ask on the macports development list - given the python2.5 and perl5.8 dependencies I would guess this is an old port and needs to be redone <comment63459> The bug is marked as fixed, but what do I need to do to get that version on my system? <comment63919> @WimDeblauwe run `sudo port selfupdate` to get the latest port metadata and then do the port install
