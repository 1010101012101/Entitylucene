What RAM is appropriate to use in a Mid 2011 Mac Mini? <body> I'm trying to upgrade the RAM of my MAC Mini. Other questions I have found don't show which RAM is appropriate to use.  What RAM should I use?  I'm looking for all the specifics:  ul litype/li livoltage/li liclock speed/li liECC/Non-ECC/li /ul  <answer265553> The correct RAM to use is SODIMM DDR3 with 1.5V as voltage and 1333MHz as clock speed.  Ensure the latency is CL9 and remember that your MAC mini supports a maximum of 8GB.  <comment332950> See http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i7-2.7-mid-2011-specs.html (and probably a lot of other sites) <comment332996> @patrix the site didn't give enough info. I was just putting this here for reference. <comment333012> Then add it as an answer to the existing question please. <comment333025> @patrix I don't understand. I've already answered the question. <comment333032> It's a duplicate nevertheless and we prefer to keep things in one place. This makes it much easier for future visitors. And, as I can't move your answer to the original question, it might help you add your answer there as well.
