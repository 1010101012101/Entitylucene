Decrease Xcode code editor's file history limit <body> If you open files codeA/code, codeB/code and codeC/code in the Xcode's codeStandard Editor/code, Xcode will keep all of them in memory to enable the ability to go back to them. You can see this clearly when you close Xcode after a long time; it will close every file (codeA/code, codeB/code, codeC/code) one after the other. Is there any way to change this file history limit?
