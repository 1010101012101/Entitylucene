How to port this *nix-shell script to OS X? <body> I've got a unix-shell script that's supposed to work on nix machines. This doesn't run on OS X however, due to "cp" command not defined. Changing it to "copy" didn't help.  precodegit log -1 --pretty=format:"%h" | xargs -I %id% git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r %id% | xargs -I % cp --parents % upd/ /code/pre  The script should make a copy of files changed in last git commit.  <answer187552> Have a look at this SO thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11246070/cp-parents-option-on-mac  codecp/code is available on OS X, but it does not support the code--parents/code option, as I guessed. Instead of using codecp --parents/code, replace it with codeditto/code as mentioned in the SO answer.  <comment221711> I'm wondering if it has more to do with the percentage sign than with cp. Because cp should be available in any case, it's such a basic command. <comment221712> or "cp" on OS X doesn't know the --parents option <comment221713> Thanks, I will look at it and possibly reply with a solution. <comment221725> If you have Command Line Tools for Xcode installed you can download GNU core utilities and install the GNU version of `cp` which works with `--parents`.  I just tested it and it works nice.
