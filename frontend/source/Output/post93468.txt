Plays in a MacBook Air Superdrive but not in a MacBook Pro Matshita DVD-R <body> I tried to play a DVD that I created on a MacPro in my MacBook Pro - 15-inch, Mid 2010 (The Matshita DVD-R listed below). I wanted to preserve this and upgrade it to a better DVD but my MacBook Pro would not read it so that it could copy it. But it also could not play it.  I finally tried the DVD in a MacBook Air Superdrive, and it worked perfectly, both playing and copying.  The DVD was one of those complimentary Apple Burnable DVD's that ship with the computer.  I do not remember the program I used to create the DVD - it was either iDVD or DVD Studio Pro available in 2004.  I also tried playing and reading the DVD from a PC with Windows 7.  It was able to play the DVD but not copy it to the drive.   Should I replace my SuperDrive or attempt to get firmware even though it doesn't recommend it?
