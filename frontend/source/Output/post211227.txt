MacBook Retina 15" HDMI glitches <body> I have a 15" Retina MacBook (mid-2012), and I encounter issues with HDMI external displays.  Sometimes, the connected display will turn either totally black or with white noise for a few seconds, and come back to normal.  Also, it happens that instead of returning to normal, the external display shows weird colours (lot of green and magenta).  I have tested several external screens and cables, and it seems that the issue is not related to the screen, but to the Mac.  Note the issue does not apply when using a Thunderbolt to VGA or Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter.  Anyone already encountered the issue?  I tagged it as Hardware, but it might as well be software. Since the issue is happening for more than 2 years now, my first clue was about hardware though.
