Is it possible to take multiple, continuous photos with a delay in iPhone? <body> In iOS, if you hold the home botton in the codeCamera/code app, you can take a series of photos continuously. However, I want to use this with a delay (10 sec), and since there is a reason to use the delay I can't hold the button.  So is it possible to take a series of photos continuously, possibly the number of photos or the total time set in advance?  I use iOS 10.2.1 and would like to use it in both the main and selfie camera.  <answer275598> There is a good app to do this called "Lapse-It". It is free with a paid upgrade, but the free mode will do what you ask.  <comment346718> You may find this [question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/239495/168832) interesting. <comment346719> @Monomeeth Oh that question is talking about the opposite? But I disable HDR but can't take the multiple photos. I assume that may even be just a bug, though. <comment346720> Yeah, that's why I thought it may be useful to you. By reading through the answers and comments it seems you need to make sure the flash is off for burst mode to work. Worth a try. <comment346722> @Monomeeth Of course I tried but it didn't work. I see it is strange for the burst mode to be enabled if you disable the flush. <comment346930> Is this a camera app? It just clocks the timer but didn't take any photos. I even don't know how to use it. <comment347019> You're right. I was confusing my two time lapse apps. I've now corrected the answer.
