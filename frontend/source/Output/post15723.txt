Using the Apple Battery Charger with non-Apple batteries <body> The Apple Battery Charger's product description page states:     The Apple Battery Charger can recharge one or two batteries at a time. It's optimized for Apple-supplied batteries and it works with AA NiMH batteries from other companies, too.   Does anyone know the required specifications for using non-Apple batteries?   The Apple supplied batteries are AA Ni-MH Min. 1900 mAh 1.2V HR6.  I have some Powerex AA Ni-MH Min. 2500 mAh 1.2V, so I'm wondering if they are compatible. I'm also curious what other non-Apple batteries are compatible.  <answer15724> h2Apple Batteries are Rebranded Sanyo Batteries/h2  According to engadget, the Apple supplied batteries are actually Sanyo Eneloop HR-3UTG, so it appears that's one option for buying additional batteries to use with the Apple Battery Charger.  h2Powerex Batteries Don't Work/h2  According to the Apple Battery Charger Manual,     ul   liFlashing Amber: May indicate any of the following conditions:   ul   liThe batteries havenâ€™t been properly installed in the charger./li   liAn unsupported type of battery is in the charger./li   liThe batteries may be faulty or damaged and should be replaced./li   /ul/li   /ul   With that information, I tried charging the Powerex 2500 and 2700 batteries but received a flashing amber light.  Looks like I need to buy some of the Sanyo Eneloop HR-3UTG batteries.  <comment17112> Well, I sometimes get flashing amber with the Apple-supplied batteries.  If so, I take them out and carefully reinsert them, then charging begins.  So perhaps make no conclusion about other batteries based on a single try. <comment17154> @GEdgar: I also get the flashing amber sometimes with the Apple supplied batteries, so I did remove and reinsert to make sure that it wasn't a fluke.
