Spotlight/Safari Suggestions Inconsistent <body> I am running the latest version of macOS Sierra and the Spotlight and Safari suggestions are very inconsistent, by which I mean that it only works sometimes. It wasn't working initially, but after forcing it to re-index, it worked for a few minutes only. Spotlight/Safari suggestions are supported in my region, so that isn't an issue.
