Why do qwertzuio keys suddenly stop working and randomly start working again? <body> I have a MacBook Air (13 Inch, Mid-2011) running OS X 10.11.3 (15D21)  ul li1,7 GHz Intel Core i5/li li4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3/li /ul  The first row of letters: codeqwertzuio/code (German keyboard--it would be codeqwertyuio/code on a U.S. English keyboard) stops working mysteriously at random times. I have no idea what causes it, but then they suddenly start working again days later. I have seen this issue asked before by googling the problem. I am hoping for a canonical answer here.  h1Related/h1  ul lihttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5982152?tstart=0/li lihttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/6752360?start=0&amp;tstart=0/li lihttp://www.techbuzz.in/keys-qwer-uiop-not-working-rest-other-keys-are-working-fine-laptop-desktop.php/li /ul  <comment367721> Does this happen with an external keyboard?  If not, it probably indicates the internal one is damaged and needs repair.
