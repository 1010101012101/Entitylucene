Strange graphical artifacts <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), running macOS Sierra.  I noticed strange graphical artifacts when using my computer.  For example, when switching from one desktop to another (you know, when sliding 3 fingers to the left/right), sometimes, some parts won't slide, and will just 'pop out' when the sliding effect is done.  Sometimes parts of webpages are black.  Here are a few examples:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a385r.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTAgj.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4wtq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fix that?  <comment322380> Is the bug browser-related (which one?) or a more general phenomenon?
