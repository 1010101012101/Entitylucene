How can i send system shortcuts and trackpad gesture to the screen sharing app? <body> I am working on Yosemite 10.10.5 and using screen sharing to make remote control of mac. But my local mac intercepts system shortcuts and trackpad gesture even if screen sharing app is activated. I would like to send them to screen sharing app. Is it possible?  <comment292104> This depends massively on what software you're using and how it's set up. Can you please elaborate? <comment292111> I just mean /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Screen\ Sharing.app. I want to send system shortcut such as mission control (Ctrl + Up arrow) and trackpad gestures to this app. I don't know what exactly you want me to elaborate.? <comment292146> If need be, Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+[left/right] arrow does good for switching spaces
