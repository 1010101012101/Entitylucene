How can I undo "always allow" in keychain item <body> By mistake, I clicked on "always allow" on a file in my keychain on the Mac. How do I undo this and restrict access? I tried to correct it by clicking on Access Control. There I selected "confirm before allowing access" but it didn't work. I can still see the password for that file without entering a password.  <answer116212> You should be able to clear out any white listed programs and then reset the default behavior from Keychain Access.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2nXDB.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liFirst select Fantastical (or any apps that are cleared) and then press the -/li liSecond, choose Confirm and Ask as needed./li liThird, select Attributes and make sure the changes are saved (you should probably have to authenticate as well at this step)/li liGo back to Access Control to verify the settings have been saved properly/li /ul  If this doesn't work, you might need to repair that keychain containing that item, also using Keychain Access menu to open the Keychain First Aid tool.
