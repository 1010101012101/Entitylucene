Mail can't delete old email address <body> I recently picked up a used Macbook Pro with Lion installed.  There are no other accounts in the native Mail app except my new Gmail one.    However, when I send an email, the "Reply-to" address that the recipient sees is the email address of the previous owner.    I cannot find a way to remove this email address, it is not in the settings of my sole Gmail account.  It seems to be registered somewhere in the account info of the Mac.    <answer29908> Check the "me" card.  Open Address Book, go to the "Card" menu, and select "Go to my card".  Edit if required.  Restart Mail, and send yourself a test email.  Check the from address.  Also, I know you've already checked this, but please check again. In Mail.app, go to Preferences, Accounts, and emmake sure/em that the email address is set correctly.  <comment34329> Unfortunately that did not work : ( <comment34333> Did you create a new account for yourself or are you using the account the previous owner used already? <comment34401> I created a new account. <comment35177> I bet patrix meant creating new user account on system (it's in System Preferences) i.e. not new mail account in Mail.
