How can I select all in a Google doc with an iPad? <body> I created a new Google doc on my iPad2. When I strongselect all/strong to copy the whole contents, it only selects the current line.  Is there a known workaround for this?  <answer43074> Try putting the google docs into desktop mode. Click the Desktop link  at the bottom of the page.     View in: Mobile | Desktop   Then select edit menu in Google docs then "Select all"  <comment49061> Thx. I tried this but 1. I had to convert the docs to the new format, which Google is going to make obligatory anyway :( and 2. I got an infinite (presumably) series of error pop ups from Google! This happens even with a new doc! <comment55593> Tried again, this time it works, thanks!
