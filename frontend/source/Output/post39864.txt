Items copied from CD as read only <body> I have a CD that when the items are copied to the desktop (OS 10.6) the items are marked as read only. The CD is UDF formatted and I have read the following on another site:      The Mac simply doesn't understand the UDF format which is widely used   by many Windows and Linux computers, along with various consumer DVD   burners, video cameras and other devices. OS X gets confused when   reading files, thinking they have read-only privileges or locked files   or different owners, depending on what software was used to write the   disc. Other systems don't suffer from this problem because they fully   implement the 13-year-old UDF standard, but OS X doesn't.   Is there any way to get copied items to inherit permission of the folder that they are being copied to? I don't want to have to modify permissions everytime files are copied.  <answer39960> One way would be to copy the files from the command line using codersync/code: It supports a flag code--chmod/code, so you can say, e.g.,  precodersync -a --chmod=u+w /Volumes/name-of-the-CD/ /wherever/ /code/pre  to turn on writable flag for the user (you). Beware, though, that codersync/code takes a while getting used to, especially when recursively copying directories. Whether or not you end the name of the source directory with a slash actually makes a difference â€¦  <comment45150> I'm commenting rather than answering because this isn't a complete solution. You can use Automator to create a Folder Action that will act on any file added to a defined folder. Automator allows you to use shell scripts within workflows. You can create a shell script to change permissions that will be applied to any file copied into the folder (or folders) to which this Folder Action is attached.
