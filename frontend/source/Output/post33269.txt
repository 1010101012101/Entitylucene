Command+S At Boot Doesn't Activate Single-User Mode <body> 10.6.8. Hold down Cmd+S throughout the entire boot process. It always goes to the regular login screen and starts doing the "stop holding down buttons" chime. Why?  <answer33293> Figured it out. I'd changed my keyboard layout to Dvorak which apparently isn't honored at boot, defaulting to QWERTY. I pressed Cmd+O (where the S would've been) and it worked.  <comment37962> This question should be marked as resolved. One way you could do this is post the solution yourself and mark it as the accepted answer.
