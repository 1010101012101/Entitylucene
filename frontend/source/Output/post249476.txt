Which graphics cards are supported by a Late-2009 iMac 27inch? <body> I have the strongATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics processor/strong with strong512MB of GDDR3 memory/strong installed on an strongi5 iMac 27inch setup/strong. Given that my current card is malfunctioning and that versions of that card are prohibitively expensive, which cards could I theoretically upgrade to?  strongHere is my complete system./strong https://support.apple.com/kb/SP696?locale=en_US  <answer249479> According to iFixit.com, you can upgrade the video card to the same one that was in the last 2011 model:     If you are using the iMac 27" late 2009 or 2010 model for games you   might want to upgrade your graphics card to the 6 series of the last   2011 model.      For any other reason this upgrade is not recommended as the power gain   is only noticeable in games.   Since you have to replace the card, it's definitely a good time to look at an upgrade:  ul liATI 4850 Card Approx $150 (used) to $400 (new)/li liATI Radeon 6970 Card - Approx. $200 (used) to $800 (new) /li /ul  The ATI Radeon 5xxx series from the 2010 should works as well, but they are very rare for some reason.  For the price and convenience, I would go with the 6xxx series if upgrading.  If I had the time to search and scour the web for a good deal, I would try to get the 6970 at a good price, but I don't think I would spend the extra money on upgrading a computer that was technically 7 years old with a graphics card that was 5 years old.  Especially so since the graphics upgrade wouldn't be noticeable unless I was gaming.  And if that was the case, I would probably have a console or a PC...but that's just me.  The iFixit link I provided has an excellent step by step on how to replace this card.  <comment309461> Thanks! So this card (Apple iMac 27" A1312 ATI Radeon HD 6970M 661-5950 Mid-2011) would be compatible? <comment309462> According to ifixit, yes.  I did some reading and it appears that interface is the same.  Obviously OS X ships with the drivers that you need so you should be good to go.
