how to run alias using bash -c from IDEA <body> I'm trying to run a program defined in an alias (and the alias is defined in a source file)  precodealias myapp="/somepath/app -arg1 -arg2" /code/pre  Then I go to IDEA and create an External Tool  precodeProgram: Bash Arguments: -c "source /filewithalias.sh &amp;&amp; myapp"  /code/pre  Then when I run, I get the following message:  precodebash: myapp: command not found /code/pre  EDIT:  I already tried prepending  precodeshopt -s expand_aliases /code/pre  To the command string but the result is still the same  <answer141764> The reason of your failure is that codemyapp/code is evaluated by codebash/code at the time of the line evaluation, i.e. before its definition. I suggest you to avoid aliases for this purpose (I can't find any easy method with aliases).  Here is a simple method. If you don't have already one, create a personnal directory for all your binaries and shell scripts:  precode$ mkdir ~/bin /code/pre  strongAdd/strong this new directory within your shell standard codePATH/code:  precodePATH=${PATH}:~/bin export PATH /code/pre  Create a new shell script to fire your application with all the required arguments:  precode$ cd ~/bin $ cat &gt;myapp.sh &lt;&lt;eof /somepath/app -arg1 -arg2 eof $ make myapp /code/pre  check that it is working from your actual environment:  precode$ myapp /code/pre  Then call it from IDEA:  precodeProgram: myapp /code/pre  check that it is working from within IDEA.
