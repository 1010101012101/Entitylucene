Issuing connecting to AFP shares - "(Error) Volume: Root store set to FSOnly with matching create!" <body> I'm having an issue connecting to my AFP shares on my unRAID server. After a couple of days of troubleshooting, I've narrowed down the issue to my Macbook and not the unRAID server.  I am able to connect to my AFP share, but before my Mac can connect it spins up all of my spun down unRAID disks (14 of them) and it takes a good minute or so before the share becomes available while this process happens. I've checked on another Macbook, and it's able to connect within a couple of seconds and only spin up the 1 hard drive it needs on my server. So it's definitely something with my Macbook that's querying for all the disk data from the server.  Here's the log from when I manually connect:  precode7/29/13 8:32:39.000 PM kernel[0]: AFP_VFS afpfs_mount: /Volumes/disk1, pid 879 7/29/13 8:32:39.000 PM kernel[0]: AFP_VFS afpfs_mount : succeeded on volume 0xffffff81d10f9008 /Volumes/disk1 (error = 0, retval = 0) 7/29/13 8:32:43.878 PM mds[54]: (Error) Volume: Root store set to FSOnly with matching create! (loaded:1) /code/pre  Note the following:  precode7/29/13 8:32:43.878 PM mds[54]: (Error) Volume: Root store set to FSOnly with matching create! (loaded:1) /code/pre  That's the part that differes on my Macbook compared to the Macbook that works correctly.  Here are the steps I've taken so far:  ul liRepaired permissions/li liCleared Spotlight data and forced a refresh/li liCleared Keychain of all logins related to this server via AFP/li liDeleted Finder preferences/li liUninstalled TotalFinder/li liUninstalled Alfred/li liUninstalled Pacifist/li liUninstalled OSXfuse/li liUninstalled BlueHarvest/li liUninstalled NFSManager/li liRebooted and tested after every change to try and find the culprit/li /ul  Any ideas on what the exact issue could be? I've removed every application I can think of that could somehow tie into Finder or networking. I've googled for my exact error but couldn't find anything relevant.
