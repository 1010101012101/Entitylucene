Audio jack converter for iPhones <body> I purchased a set of studio headphones from Audio Technica. Turns out, the pin is 3.5 mm and is too big for my iPhone 5. Is there some sort of adapter that I can buy that will convert the pin to the one for an iPhone? (Links to the suitable product at RadioShack would be appreciated :))   <answer142914> The iPhone jack is 3.5mm.  You probably have the 1/4 inch (6.3mm) and that is why it does not fit.  When looking for a adapter make sure it has 3 black rings and not 2. That is the iPhone required plug.  <comment168334> Shopping and buying recommendations are shunned on this site. That said, go type "iphone to 3.5mm adapter" into google. <comment168335> The iPhone headphone jack *is* a 3.5 mm jack. I think you'll need to elaborate on your problem -- is that the headphones you purchases have a larger than 3.5 mm plug or that they have a 3.5 mm plug but it just won't sit in the jack on the phone because of a case or what not? <comment168348> Oops :) I didn't know that. Thank you :). It was the plug used for studio appliances and I need to use it for my iPhone 5. <comment168349> Thank you :) This is what I needed :)
