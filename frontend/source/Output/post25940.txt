Keyboard Shortcut for moving left/right a space doesn't work <body> After going to:  strongPreferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Mission Control/strong  I am able to assign a keyboard shortcut to move left/right a space. However pressing shortcut I assigned does not activate the command. I have tried other keys which are not binded to any other system commands and they do not work as well. Other shortcut are fine   Any ideas on how to fix this?  I am running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1.  <answer174355> Did you have any luck with this? I'm having the same issue with Yosemite. All the shortcuts work except those ones, I try changing them to anything and they still don't work. I even tried assigning "move right/left a space" on BetterTouchTools and that doesn't work either, even if the assignment is done by using a touchpad gesture, it seems there is no way to move between workspaces, the only way it works is using a 4 finger drag with the touchpad.  Shortcuts to move to a specific space work without issues. And the shortcuts work on the guest account. Still not working after logging out and back in.  Edit: Restarting the computer seemed to solved the issue.  Edit2: Happened again, but I think I finally discovered the reason behind this behaviour. It seems to me it's very strange bug with shortcuts.  If you go to the preferences and change the shortcut from ^+→ and ^+← to something like ^+1 and ^+2 you're going to have conflict with the "Switch to desktop 1/2" shortcut. That's not really a problem if you disable them.  Ok so you change the shortcut and you disabled the other one and now it works perfectly.  Now try doing a codekillall Dock/code. Tachan! Shortcut is not working! Weird! Nothing you do makes it work, changing the shortcut doesn't work, nothing works!  Now change the disabled "Switch to desktop 1/2" shortcut to something like ⌘+1 and ⌘+2 and to another codekillall Dock/code. And tada! The switching is working again!  What's happening? I honestly have no idea, it seems the conflicting shortcuts interfere if the Dock is started with the 2 conflicting shortcuts, even if one of those is disabled.  Edit3: Created a video explaining how to reproduce the defect, and how to solve it.  <answer217317> This helped me:   https://discussions.apple.com/message/18340925#18340925  precodePaste this into Terminal (it's all one line, not two):  mv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist ~/Desktop/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist  Press 'return'. Log out and log in to your system. Go to System Prefs and set up your hotkeys as you want. /code/pre  <comment29503> Let me try this out. What shortcut do you have set right now to move left/right a space? <comment209847> What moves are you trying to achieve? Go left or right by one place?? <comment209848> *Space*, OK, I got it ! I was thinking of space character.
