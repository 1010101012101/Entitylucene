I am running a while loop which ends in & and I closed the terminal, so I can't stop it now <body> This is the code  precodewhile sleep 1; do say "1"; done &amp; /code/pre  I closed the terminal, but now I can't stop my Mac saying "one" every second. It is very annoying.  <answer268568> ul liOpen a new Terminal tab/window/li liRun codeps alx|grep "[s]leep 1"/code (maybe several times, until you get the codesleep 1/code as part of the output  precodepse@Mithos:~$ ps alx|grep sleep 1   502  1268  1245   0  20  0  2432796   1460 -      S      ??    0:00.00 sleep 31536000   502 80121   809   0  31  0  2432796   1772 -      S+   s002    0:00.00 sleep 1 /code/pre/li liKill the shell it's running in by using the parent PID of the sleep command (the number in the third column, code809/code in this case): codekill -HUP YOUR-PARENT-PID-HERE/code/li /ul  <answer268569> Go into Terminal and run codeps aux | grep sleep/code and you should be able to see your while command as a result.  Note the grep will also show up.  Find the PID of the process and key in codekill [pid]/code.  If it fails then codekill -9 [pid]/code note in place of the brackets actually use the number of the process, without the brackets.  <comment337217> This just kills the `sleep` process once, not the loop. And with only one second of sleep time, the most likely output will be `-bash: kill: ([pid]) - No such process` <comment337219> it says: grep: 1: No such file or directory <comment337220> @Cemre Suler, Use: `ps alx | grep "[s]leep 1"` <comment337230> and how to kill the progress now? <comment337234> @CemreSuler See the third item in the answer: `kill -HUP [ppid]` where `[ppid]` is the number you get as described in the answer. <comment337235> @user3439894 Thanks! <comment337236> @Cemre Suler, I would just use `kill -HUP "$(pgrep sleep)"` and not bother with: `ps ...` <comment337238> @user3439894 It's not enought to kill `sleep`, the loop will just iterate. You need to kill the shell process executing the loop. <comment337240> @patrix, I executed `while sleep 1; do say "1"; done &` and closed Terminal as stated in the OP and it killed everything, so I open Terminal and again executed what was in the OP leaving Terminal open this time.  Then in another Terminal I executed `kill -HUP "$(pgrep sleep)"` and that was that no more 1 every second. If it doesn't work that way for you then the OP has omitted something as closing Terminal should have killed the  `while loop` to begin with. <comment337250> @user3439894 Actually I only tried without the `&` part, so if it works with `pgrep` even the better :-)
