Can I view iPad screen from Mac? <body> There are several questions that ask whether you can control an iPad from a Mac (like this one). But is it possible to view your iPad screen from a Mac when it's plugged in via USB or wirelessly without jailbreaking it?  I can remote login to my Mac at work and my iPad is connected so I can debug on it via XCode, but I can't see the results.  <answer154075> You can with Yosemite &amp; iOS 8  Launch Quicktime player &amp; select File  New Movie Recording [Cmd/opt/N]br Click on the small downward-facing triangle next to the record button. This lets you select an alternate recording source, which now includes your iPhone or iPad.  <answer154095> Haven't tried this myself but this seems like what you might be looking for. It mirrors iPad to the Mac or PC wirelessly. No jail breaking required. http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/  <comment181338> NB: This works when the device is connected via USB, but not over wifi. <comment181419> I have used Reflector and it works really well over Wifi. Both the computer and the iDevice have to be on the same Wifi network. <comment184922> My iPad 3 is connected via USB but I'm not seeing it as an option. Is there anything else I need to set, e.g. permission in iOS? <comment184974> it may depend on what you are remote logging with, some screen-sharing won't share overlay video at all, some can't interact with attached USB devices. I'm not sure of one that will do both, tbh, might have to test a few <comment200496> That's without remote logging, just on the Mac with iPad connected via USB.
