How do you customize Lion Finder sidebar icons? <body> I'm not looking to hack resources or use SIMBL plugins, but I would like to be able to show custom icons in the Lion sidebar.  As far as I've understood custom icons on the folder no longer show up in the sidebar and the "built-in" icons that are there are hardcoded to resources pathed in: code/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/code  However, I notice that the new versions of Dropbox now update the "Dropbox" sidebar icon to be a custom icon and it seems to be able to do this:  ol liWithout using some code injection thing like SIMBL or needing root access/li liWithout the actual Dropbox process being running/li /ol  So this leads me to believe that Lion sidebar icons emare/em customisable, but this metadata is stored elsewhere?  codexattr -l ~/Dropbox/code doesn't seem to list anything interesting:  precodecom.apple.FinderInfo: 00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| 00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| 00000020 /code/pre  <answer46415> There's a good topic on this over at StackOverflow   The gist of how Dropbox does it is this:  ul liinjecting code into the mach_kernel so that it's not dependant on Dropbox running/li /ul  So the answer is emprobably/em no, you can't do it without using code injection, but this may change in the future, or not as the case may be.  <comment53159> Looked at the video [linked to](http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-how-dropbox-did-it-and-how-python-helped-4896698) in the comments there. Had no idea Dropbox was doing all this ugliness in the background for all kinds of Finder stuff. Feel quite differently towards it now, but as they said the result is: "it works" <comment345286> Wondering if this is still the case 5 years later?
