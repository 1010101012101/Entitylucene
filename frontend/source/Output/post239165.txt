Cannot reach webpage for certificate generation on my developer account <body> I am trying to reach the webpage for certificates under codedeveloper.apple.com/code. But I get redirected to the Welcome page. My Apple ID is an iCloud address code*...@icloud.com/code.  hr  Why does codehttps://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate//code  redirect codeto https://developer.apple.com/account/#/welcome/code ?  <answer239174> Your AppleID appears to not be registered as a Developer.  You must enroll in the Developer program to operate on certificates.
