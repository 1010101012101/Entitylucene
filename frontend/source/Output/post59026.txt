How to install Mountain Lion on a disk that cannot be formatted in recovery mode? <body> I'm trying to do a clean install of Mountain Lion but I'm not being able to format my partition.  I previously had Lion, encrypted the disk, then upgraded to Mountain Lion, then booted into recovery mode to format &amp; reinstall Mountain Lion.  On recovery mode (kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd), when I tried to format the encrypted partition I got an error saying something like "not enough space on core something". Now the partition doesn't show up on Disk Utility; only the disk, "Macintosh HD", but I am not able to repartition it.  The Mountain Lion installer doesn't find any disk to install itself on.  I cannot boot the system either (without booting to recovery).  If I open the terminal and type codediskutil list/code I can see that there's an Apple_CoreStorage on /dev/disk0s2, but I cannot reformat that volume ("The disk is in use by Core Storage as a Physical Volume").  How to format the disk and install Mountain Lion?  <answer59028> You should be able to use codedd/code to destroy the partition's header. You can then format (erase) it and run the install.  From the installer run strongTerminal/strong and type the following:  precodedd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0s2 bs=1024 count=1024 /code/pre  Do be warned, this will irrecoverably destroy all data on that partition. But it looks like that's what you're expecting. Make sure you don't accidentally target the wrong thing.  Also note that I haven't done this, exactly. I've used this technique to destroy the ementire partition table/em, not just a single partition. But I think it should work.  When you're done quit strongTerminal/strong and run strongDisk Utility/strong. You won't get any complaints about Core Storage.  <answer59042> When the Partition tab of Disk Utility in Mountain Lion can not manage a partition on a physical disk that uses Apple Core Storage:  h1Ignore the Partition tab/h1  Instead of selecting the logical volume group (to the left):   ul liselect the encrypted logical partition (to the right of, and below, the LVG)/li liuse the Erase tab. /li /ul  hr  What techniques for disk, volume and file system management are possible with OS X, but troublesome within Disk Utility?

Identify the logical CoreStorage volume from that list and note the UUID string.   Then type codediskutil CoreStorage delete UUID/code where emUUID/em is the string you identified.   You can then partition with Disk Utility and run a Mountain Lion install.   <comment68003> This did not work, I still have the exact same issues. <comment68006> Is it safe to format the entire /dev/disk0? The volumes EFI and Apple_Boot seem to be important. <comment68008> That will also destroy your recovery partition. If you have an external disk to boot from (or a newer Mac that will netboot over the Internet) then yes it's safe. You just need to re-partition afterward. <comment68010> Ok, do you have more information about how to recreate those partitions? <comment68011> Creating a single partition with Disk Utility will restore everything except the recovery partition. If I understand correctly, the OS install will create the recovery partition. <comment68148> I'll have to try this. <comment185179> Thanks for this. I tried a hundred other solutions with `diskutil` and `diskutil cs`, but none of the operations completed successfully. Zeroing out the volume with `dd` was the only way to nuke it sufficiently to be able to reformat it as a non-fusion drive.
