Macbook pro shutdown error after java OS X 2015-001 install <body> I had a java error when i execute photoshop CS5,I needed to install an older version (OS X 2015-001) in order to run my adobe applications. After that installation my macbook won't shutdown anymore. When i go in the menu and select shutdown,all my programs close, but my macbook stays on.  The only way to shutdown my mac is with terminal line : sudo shutdown -h now. But i don't think thats a good way to shutdown my macbook  How can I analyse and resolve this?  <comment360951> Which version of macOS are you running? <comment360952> And what is/was the Java error?
