Actual Folder Size? <body> I have a TM back up from a retired drive. The folder info screen looks like this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4g9rg.png" alt="enter image description here"  The drive is 3TB and there's still 900GB free, so the 4.75TB reported size is not correct. Is there a simple way to find out how big this folder actually is? I need to archive it someplace and want to know how much space it actually takes up.   <answer166298> I prefer to get size information from the command line, especially when I have an administrator account on the computer and I'm logged in with that user.   Open a terminal (either cmd-spacebar/Spotlight and then type "terminal" or through Applications-Utilities).  Type:     sudo du -sh /Volumes/Feynman 3.0 and hit enter  You will be prompted for your admin password, and then du will calculate the size of the folders/files on the disk.  You can also then add to the path (or add "/*" on the end of "/Volumes/Feynman 3.0") to get the sizes of the subfolders to aid in further troubleshooting.
