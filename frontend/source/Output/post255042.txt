How to repair Apple boot after dual-booting Ubuntu 16.04 <body> I had the same issue as this poster (https://askubuntu.com/questions/710369/did-not-install-refit-cant-boot-back-into-osx-el-capitain-ubuntu-15-10#=), but that question doesn't have a resolution.  I have the same problem: I default boot into Ubuntu Linux, which is great. (Although, my charger/MBP keeps overheating under Ubuntu Linux, so, not super great...let me know if you know the answer to that one.) If I shutdown, restart and hold down the control button, and then select the Macintosh OS X drive that pops up, it takes me to my last login screen and then eventually shows me the circle with a line through it.  I've followed Rod Smith's instructions for creating a pastebin from rEFInd, check them out here: http://pastebin.com/yxhvuJba  Let me know if you can see what's broken!  Details: I used these instructions to install Ubuntu: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/  The MBP I'm using is 11,2.
