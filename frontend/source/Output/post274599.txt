Get rid of dead keys <body> I am using a normal german keyboard and am well aware of the different keystrokes, to insert different diacritic characters as œ or Á.  But being a programmer, I desire to be able to insert some diacritic characters directly, instead of using that key as dead key.  For example, I would love to insert code^/code by only tying the ^ once.  How to get rid of those dead keys?  <answer274614> One way is to create a custom layout with Ukelele  <comment345455> Thank you for your answer.  There is no onboard posibility? <comment345487> @Jan  You could create a text replacement in system prefs/keyboard/text, but it requires typing two characters I think.
