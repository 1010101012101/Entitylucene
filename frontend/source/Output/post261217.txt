Update to Sierra doesn't update <body> I have tried twice to run the Sierra update from the App Store. It comes with a pop-up that the restart will be in 60 seconds, when I fasten it up by clicking the 'Restart' button in the notification, the Mac begins to restart.  When it closed everything, I get a black screen with 'Installing software update', that takes approx. 5 minutes. After that, it just starts back up again, open windows being reopened, just as expected.  However - when I check 'About this Mac' it still says its running El Capitan 10.11.6.  hr  The update has disappeared from my App Store. However, it doesn't list the update at the bottom of the page under 'Updates Installed in the Last 30 Days'  <comment327104> What is the year and model of your Mac? <comment327105> MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) <comment327106> An update to Sierra doesn't exist! That's an **upgrade** (e.g from 10.10.5 to 10.12.1). The only system related update for Sierra is Upd 10.12.1 (from 10.12.0 to 10.12.1) with a size of 1.36 GB. If you upgrade to Sierra, the full Sierra installer will not appear in  'Updates Installed in the Last 30 Days'. Your question is somehow flawed because you either didn't try to install Sierra or you are installing an ElCap update or an ElCap security update. <comment327108> You're right. It was a Security Update. It really looked like it was an update to Sierra.
