opening file from text wrangler to terminal <body> I'm sure this is a very basic question, but I'm just beginning to learn programming and I've gotten to a lesson where I have to create a file in text wrangler, save it to the desktop (called test.txt) and then copy it into the terminal. I then have to use the "less" command to view the file. How do I get that file from my desktop into the command line? and I'm using a mac fyi..  <answer118093> Open up codeTerminal/code.  Your Desktop is at code~/Desktop/code (the code~/code is a shortcut for your home folder) so codecd ~/Desktop/codekbdreturn/kbd to go there then codeless test.txt/codekbdreturn/kbd  By the way, if you are going to use codeTextWrangler/code and codeTerminal/code you might want to visit http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/ and download the TextWrangler command line tools which allow you to open a file in TextWrangler from the command line, among other things.  <comment137874> Awesome..it worked, thank you very much! and I will get the command line tool, thanks again.
