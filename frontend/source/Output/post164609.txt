What's this button on Calendar.app? <body> On OS X 10.9.5, the Calendar.app toolbar sometimes adds this button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g783w.png" alt="mystery box"  There's no tooltip, and the Calendar toolbar isn't editable so there's no way to show a label for it.  I can't find anything in the online documentation about it.  I think it has something to do with remote/subscribed calendars, but what, exactly?  <answer164613> This is the Notifications button.     The Notifications button shows how many invitations you have. If you don’t have any invitations, it isn’t available.   supSource: Calendar: Reply to an event or calendar invitation/sup  The notification button also shows when changes are made to a subscribed calendar. In this case, the standard Accept/Decline/Maybe buttons are replaced by a single OK option to dismiss.
