I upgraded to macOS Sierra. Now my disk utility doesn't show what types of files are taking up space <body> I have a mid-2012 Macbook Pro (non-retina) running macOS Sierra and I recently upgraded the hard drive to a 240GB SSD and moved the 500GB HDD to the CD bay, and then more recently upgrading to MacOS Sierra. Now in disk utility it does not show what file types are taking up space like it used to in all the previous versions of OS X. Am I being stupid or is this a glitch?

You can get there by clicking the apple logo in the status bar, clicking About Mac, and then clicking storage. This should give a real breakdown of what is on the disk. <comment323696> @bret7600 This works... sort of. It says that I have 90GB of documents, which can't possibly be correct. It appears to be counting all my video footage as documents. Thanks for the help.
