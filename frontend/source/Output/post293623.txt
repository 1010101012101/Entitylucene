Macbook displays wrong time <body> The problem started when I reset the windows bootcamp partition. It kind of removed the bootcamp drivers from windows. (there is no bootcamp icon on the system tray).  In Mac osx, the date and time is always displayed incorrectly. Even when I set it to automatic. When I tried to set the time manually, the time displayed is still wrong. Whats going on?  I also tried to reset the NVRAM by holding cmd + alt + P + R.... But then the system would just keep rebooting without displaying anything until I release the keys.
