Multi-monitor: spaces thumbnails on external monitor missing <body> I've been having the following issue since about two weeks:  My external monitor, containing the OS X title bar, does not show the thumbnails for my three spaces when in mission control. My retina's monitor (secondary) does show them as before.  [ Nice, this question need a screenshot, but I don't have enough reputation. :( ]  strongExternal (primary) monitor:/strong  No grey border in mission control. The outermost bg is the wallpaper for that space on the Retina display. It will change as well when moving to another space using ^left/^right  I can still move an app to another space by drag 'n dropping them to the place where the thumbnail should be. So it's not that they're gone; they're just invisible!  strongRetina display (secondary)/strong  As it should be in mission control: Zoomed out bg image, grey border containing three thumbnails for the three spaces I have.  Has anyone experienced these symptoms as well?  <answer99784> Restarting your emDock/em should do the trick. To do so just open the strongActivity Monitor/strong, type codedock/codeand press emEnd Process/em.  <comment117449> Here I was, convinced that I had already rebooted.
