How to run an application in a different language? <body> I have my Mac OS X Yosemite system configured in spanish, but I have an app with a horrible spanish translation, and I would like to run it (and just this app) in english. How could I do that?  <answer162650> So... there is two ways: change the main system language for some time or use this freeware, Language Switcher, which helps to launch single applications with a different language. Also you can try this variant - App Language Chooser.  <answer162651> You may try to move translation files out of application bundle. First make a copy of Your app (just in case). Then go to the strongResources/strong folder inside this app-copy (right click - show package content - enter strongContent/strong - enter strongResources/strong). Here You'll probably find directory called like: stronges_ES.lproj/strong/stronges_lproj/strong/stronges_MX.lproj/strong (or similar) - delete this dir. Launch this app-copy and check the language.  hr  strongThis is a bit overkill/strong since You can use code-AppleLanguages/code switch. Good answers in: Is it possible to launch a program in a specific language?  <comment190199> On what device? And maybe in settings there is an option to set another language... <comment190200> Oh, sorry, I forgot to tell. It's a Mac OS X Yosemite system. I edited the question. And no, the app itself has no option to set the language. <comment190201> See the answer below <comment190207> Yes, it is a duplicate, I'm sorry.
