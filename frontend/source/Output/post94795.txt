What video boards can I put in a 2008 Mac Pro to get 4 monitors (DVI)? <body> I currently have a 2008 Mac Pro with 2 Radeon HD 2600 XT video boards, each of which is driving two monitors. This setup performs acceptably, though I wouldn't be averse to faster GPUs. However, the machine periodically crashes (sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes goes for days without doing so, with no discernible pattern) with a large amount of GPU debug mode error messages in the system log. As far as I can tell, this is likely caused by either some driver bug which remains or one of the video boards is failing. This has been going on for quite some time, and while I've reported it to Apple, I don't have high hopes of it being fixed in software anytime soon.  So my question is this - what new video boards can I put in this machine that will still get me four DVI monitor hookups?  <answer94804> What version of OS X? That'll be your limiting factor on GPU support, I think. The 2008 Mac Pro (3,1) had two 16x PCIe slots, so any PCIe video card emsupported by your version of OS X/em should work.

Newer cards with OS X support may work, but there are caveats with pre-2010 Mac Pros and I doubt they'd be officially supported.  <comment111158> I'm running 10.8.3, and I assume I'll upgrade to 10.9 if this hardware is supported.
