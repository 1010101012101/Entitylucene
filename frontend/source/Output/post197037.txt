Why do iTunes and iPhone not show the same space used? <body> Unlike this previous question, it's not related to iTunes Match (haven't ever had it on).  [img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4HVhzl.png" alt="iPhone"][3] img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BYYDl.png" alt="iTunes"  Why is there such a discrepancy?  <comment236791> I was the one that asked that previous question. iTunes match not on on the said iPhone, either. I suspect it is related to cached files (Streaming video, music...), but not able to find a solution or workaround yet.
