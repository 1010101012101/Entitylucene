Trouble Mounting NTFS drive on OS X 10.9 <body> Mounting NTFS drives works in OS X natively. Mounting drives with fstab is common and can be seen here and here and here.  I was able to successfully do it with the following addition to my fstab.  precodeUUID=30ADE88E-0889-42FF-AEC3-3AE0D11C7FE4 none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  However, on reboot the next time I plugged in my drive it no longer worked.  I tried codesudo mount -a/code but that failed with the following error:  precodemount: realpath /none: No such file or directory /code/pre  The codediskutil/code command is my go-to for finding drive information.  precode➜  /  diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS 512ssd                  499.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:               Windows_NTFS 900GBWD                 900.2 GB   disk1s1 &lt;--- SEE    2:             Windows_FAT_32 100GBWDFAT              100.0 GB   disk1s2   /code/pre  Once you know your drive location in code/dev/code then you can find the UUID with codediskutil info disk1s1/code:  precode➜  /  diskutil info disk1s1    Device Identifier:        disk1s1    Device Node:              /dev/disk1s1    Part of Whole:            disk1    Device / Media Name:      Untitled 1     Volume Name:              900GBWD    Escaped with Unicode:     900GBWD     Mounted:                  No     File System Personality:  NTFS    Type (Bundle):            ntfs    Name (User Visible):      Windows NT File System (NTFS)     Partition Type:           Windows_NTFS    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 USB    SMART Status:             Not Supported    Volume UUID:              30ADE88E-0889-42FF-AEC3-3AE0D11C7FE4     Total Size:               900.2 GB (900174610944 Bytes) (exactly 1758153537 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        0 B (0 Bytes) (exactly 0 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (not mounted)    Ejectable:                Yes     Whole:                    No    Internal:                 No /code/pre  However, I'm not sure why the fstab isn't working anymore or how I can correctly mount this drive. strongHow do you mount a NTFS drive as writable in OS X?/strong  <answer144478> You don't.  OS X does not have reliable r/w support for NTFS.  Purchase one of the reliable solutions, such as Paragon, or Tuxera.  <comment170056> Just readable? OS X allows you to read NTFS without using fstab. <comment170057> Sorry, I ment "writable" :) <comment170178> OK thanks for the correction <comment170254> Source? Many people claim works fine.
