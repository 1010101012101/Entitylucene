Search filter in Messages.app does not work well. In particular it's useless on iOS <body> When I use this, it is supposed to filter down messages, but all I get shown to me are messages which are not matches, from weeks and months in the past.  It seems like something is corrupted. Maybe there's some plist to delete somewhere.   It would just be sweet to be able to search the text/iMessages history for keywords. The feature isn't working at all.  As an update, I did find this topic which does produce something that works well enough on OS X (with staggeringly bad UX), but on iOS you're still screwed because it will not search through the database on iOS. Nor is there a "next" event that you can trigger like you can with codeCmd+G/code.
