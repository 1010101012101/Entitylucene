How do I get back to Mountain Lion <body> Have down loaded Yosemite over Mountain Lion. Found Indesign CS 5 not operating although Bridge and Light Room and Photo Elements are. Apple has helped with Java 10 but a sub menu states Java SE6 and that id for Mountain Lion and Yosemite. How best can I solve this problem rapidly?  <answer170686> If you have Time Machine backups, the simple answer is to boot to your Recovery Partition and choose to Restore from Backup. Restore will give you the opportunity to select a snapshot from a date that is before your Yosemite install. Note that restoring to a date in the past means that all new purchases, mail, etc. subsequent to the restore date will be lost. Choose this one carefully.  If you downloaded Mountain Lion from the App Store, you can download it again from your App Store 'Purchases' tab. Then use something like DiskMaker X to create a bootable USB installer for Mountain Lion. Boot to the USB, enter Disk Utility, erase your Mac's disk and then reinstall Mountain Lion. During the installation process, import your user profile, apps and data from Time Machine backup. This latter process should not involve data loss, but you will likely find some tweaks that are missing, e.g., VPN configurations and the like.  Good luck! Downgrades are doable, but there may be complications and the risk of data loss in any scenario is possible. A big caveat here is that you will most likely not be able to append Time Machine backups from the newly downgraded Mountain Lion onto your Yosemite backups. Your backups will likely need to be created from scratch.  <comment200750> Solve what problem?  What are you trying to achieve?  What research have you done?  I see a lot of irrelevant detail but it's not clear to me what you are trying to achieve.  (Also, I don't know what you mean by "a sub menu states Java SE6" or "that id for Mountain Lion".  Try proof-reading your question and editing it to make it clearer?)
