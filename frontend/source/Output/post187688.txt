Can I customize the OSX screen saver to show the Day of the Week? <body> I would like to have a screen saver display (hopefully) a large text of today's day ... the message option on the screen saver seems to only allow fixed text with no meta tag support.   <answer187691> This can't be done with any of Apple's screen savers that ship with OS X.   My favorite screen saver is the Marine Aquarium ($20) screen saver which has a customizable crystal that can display the time (analog or digital), date, or a calendar.  If you Google "os x screen saver with date" you'll come up with many free or inexpensive alternatives. My favorite among these is the Pong Saver, but that doesn't provide the date.
