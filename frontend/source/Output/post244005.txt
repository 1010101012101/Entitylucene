Free software that monitor CPU temperature under El Capitan? <body> Is there some free software that can show CPU temperature in real time for OS X El Capitan?  Any way to have CPU temperature in the menu bar? doesn't provide such an option.  <answer244038> I think your best option, and the one I use, is iStat Menu.    There are hundreds of different configurations and sensors you can use to monitor every aspect of your Mac.  See the image below for a small example.  This is not freeware but you can try it out for 14 days for free to see if it works for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGsqP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer244088> Since nobody suggested it yet, you can try Macs Fan Control. I'm using it for MBP on El Capitan 10.11.5, and it shows real temperature. http://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control  <answer244089> smcFanControl has been good for me. It is simple but perfectly does the one thing I need: providing me the temperature.  https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl.git  If you have homebrew, you can use codebrew cask install smcfancontrol/code to install the program.  However, as others noted, it may not perform perfectly so if that is the case for you, you can use https://www.derman.com/iMac-Fan-Control, which is also good.  <comment300571> There are several apps listed there, 2 of which I've used [smc & iStat]; both of which do what you're asking. <comment300576> not free though <comment300577> [smcFanControl](http://www.eidac.de/) is. <comment300585> Does smcFanControl supports El Capitan? I found it only says it supports Lion <comment300824> smc has been reported to cause problems with El Capitan on some forums, just FYI @Tim
