AppleScript to close "About this Mac" window <body> How could I use AppleScript code to close the window named "About this Mac" (A propos de ce Mac in French). I need an AppleScript for this because I use Dragon Dictate 3 commands. I am handicapped and I don't manage to use any keyboard or mouse. Only Voice and edited commands.  I tried Command+W shortcut but it didn't work for this window. It works for all other Finder windows except this one.  <answer94701> The window is shown by the loginwindow process, and you can close it by clicking the close button:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "loginwindow"     click button 1 of window 1 -- or window "About This Mac" end tell /code/pre  codeclose window 1/code didn't work.  <comment110956> I tried this code but it doesn't work...set _dictateApp to (name of current application) tell application "Finder"       close front window end tell <comment110960> That's weird, Command + W works here. <comment110961> On my mac it doesnt because the window is not selected, inactive. I need to click on it to use Command W. <comment110963> Oh yeahâ€¦ sorry. Here's a tip. The About My Mac window is managed by the process `loginwindow`. I don't know if this piece of info helps, but if it does, tell me. <comment110968> Ok could you give me an example because I am a very beginner of using applescript. Thanks ? <comment111021> thanks to the poster for this code, which works like a charm !
