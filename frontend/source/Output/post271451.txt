Why is the usage and standby time always the same on my iPhone? <body> Why do the usage and standby times on my iPhone 7 Plus always show the same value?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EHWmk.jpg" alt="Usage and standby time on my iPhone 7 Plus"  I have tried restarting my phone and I have let it drain until it turns itself off to see if that would fix the problem (it has in previous versions of iOS) but does not seem to now. I assume this is due to some background process that refuses to quit. If so, how can I find out which one it is and how can I fix it? I would like to be able to track my battery usage properly if possible.  <answer271455> I have 2 possible solutions.  ol liDowngrade your iOS version./li liUse a separate battery tracking app. Just search "Battery tracker" on the app store. (As a plus, some come with widgets you can put on the Widget View)br/li /ol  If that doesn't work, then I suggest taking it to the Apple Store to get it checked out there.  **EDIT:**Here's a link I found, haven't tested it personally yet, but here Battery Doctor  <comment341223> Could you add a link to the Battery Tracker app?
