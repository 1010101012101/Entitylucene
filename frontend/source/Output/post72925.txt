Can I access a Thunderbolt drive with the AirPort Extreme? <body> Is there a way to connect a Thunderbolt hard drive to an AirPort Extreme?  <answer72934> At the moment, the only storage ports on the Airport Extreme is a USB port. So, if your Thunderbolt drive has a USB connector as well, then you can use it, otherwise you will have to wait for Apple to make a Airport Extreme with a Thunderbolt connector.  <comment127268> And it's pretty hard to imagine why they would do that. :) <comment127270> Your title and your post are two different questions...
