Convert VMWare Fusion Windows 7 VM to Bootcamp partition <body> I have a well working Windows 7 VM image running in VMWare Fusion. To improve performance I would like to boot directly into Windows, ie create a Bootcamp partition for the Windows OS to run in.   Now I run into the seemingly simple question: How can I convert the working Windows installation to become a Bootcamp partition?  I've read the question How to convert Vmware Fusion virtual machine to bootcamp image but this doesn't give much advice. It must be possible?
