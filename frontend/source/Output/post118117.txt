No more Twitter notifications on iOS 7.0.2 <body> For no apparent reason, I don't get Twitter notifications on iOS 7 anymore. Both the notification center and the badge on the app icon are affected by this. Neither the OS nor the Twitter app have been updated, also I didn't modify any related settings. Every other service works and I get the expected notifications.  <comment137851> Did you change something on the Website itself? <comment137856> @Robuust I didn't touch any setting as mentioned in my question. But your comment made me double-check everything again, and I found the cause of fault! All the notifications where disabled in the app settings. \o/
