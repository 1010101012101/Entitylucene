Load a locale from /usr/local/share/locale in OS X <body> While importing a PostgreSQL database in OS X 10.10, I got a error like "invalid locale name: en_US.utf8". I went to code/usr/share/locale/code and copied the folder codeen_US.UTF-8/code as codeen_US.utf8/code. Ok, problem solved.  But I know this solution will not work in OS X 10.11 due to that "rootless mode". I'll not be able to modify code/usr/share/locale/code.  Is there any way to load this folder from code/usr/local/share/locale/code? I tried to copy codeen_US.utf8/code to that directory and it didn't work.  <answer210103> My solution now is to simply replace the string "en_US.utf8" with "en_US.UTF-8" in the dump file. Since that file is compressed in my case (hence binary format), it was necessary to keep the same number of characters in the original line. So I remove a couple of white-spaces, transforming  precode(...) LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.utf8' LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.utf8' (...) /code/pre  into  precode(...) LC_COLLATE= 'en_US.UTF-8' LC_CTYPE= 'en_US.UTF-8' (...) /code/pre  A perl command to do that in my importing script was  precodeperl -pi -e "s/LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.utf8'/LC_COLLATE= 'en_US.UTF-8'/g" myDumpFilePath perl -pi -e "s/LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.utf8'/LC_CTYPE= 'en_US.UTF-8'/g" myDumpFilePath /code/pre  <comment248938> Did you disable SiP (rootless) <comment249109> No, and I prefer not doing it unless there is no other way around. System Integrity Protection is nice overall. <comment249123> you can disable, then do your stuff, then re-enable it. <comment252236> I would use that as last resort. I'm not sure if Apple will be resetting /usr/share/locale in the next updates, forcing me to repeat the process. <comment267108> #taketheblowonthehead similar problem, but I was trying to restore a 47GB PG_DATA directory
