Push window to beginning, not to the end of stack when I press fullscreen <body> Is it possible to push window to beginning, not to the end of stack when I press fullscreen?  For example, I have tree windows (or spaces) maximized  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCFg6.png" alt="spaces"  When I press "fullscreen" button I want new window to appear to the right of "Desktop" (left) space, not after all other spaces. Can I do this somehow?   <answer85601> In System Preferences  Mission Control, if you check the box for "Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use," then switching a window to fullscreen mode will place it to the right of the desktop space instead of at the end.
