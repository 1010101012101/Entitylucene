How do I set podcast release date in iTunes using Applescript? <body> I would like to add the release date to podcasts that I've imported into iTunes, but my applescript is returning an error about the date object.  precode    tell application "iTunes"     set theSelection to selection     if theSelection is not {} and (length of theSelection) is 1 then         set theTrack to item 1 of theSelection         log release date of theTrack as text         set release date of theTrack to date ("2011-12-23T08:00:00Z" as string)          refresh theTrack     end if end tell /code/pre  The line codeset release date of theTrack to date ("2011-12-23T08:00:00Z" as string)/code gives me this error  codeerror "Invalid date and time date 2011-12-23T08:00:00Z." number -30720/code  How do I make the string strong2011-12-23T08:00:00Z/strong into a date object that applescript won't complain about?  <answer40711> The string-to-date conversion depends on your locale settings (section "Formats" of "Language &amp; Text" Preference pane in Snow Leopard), and you can also examine the format by executing the output of AppleScript command codecurrent date/code.  However, there's a way of making date initialization in AppleScript locale-independent (and thus portable):  precodeset d to current date -- initialize new date object set {year of d, month of d, day of d, time of d} to {2011, 12, 23, 8 * hours + 13 * minutes + 39} -- the last number is seconds -- d is now set to 2011/12/23 08:13:39 /code/pre  <answer40847> Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the "release date" tag within iTunes using Applescript because the property is strongread-only/strong.  <comment45905> Ok the property is read-only, so I'll have to use something like Subler. <comment46057> by the way: if you want to always supply the date as text in a specific format, you could use a parser such as this one: https://gist.github.com/1852783 <comment46264> thanks, but I won't be able to use applescript after all.
