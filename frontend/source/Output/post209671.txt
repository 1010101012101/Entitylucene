Why do I have 57 spaces? <body> Since today I'm running OSX 10.11, but starting from OSX 10.10 (for so far I can remember) I have this issue where multiple spaces are being created without any notice or without me needing this.  I've got a HDMI monitor plugged in the Thunderbolt port on my MBP Retina Mid 2014, so I only need 2 spaces. One for my external display and one for my MBP.  For some reasone my HDMI monitor is always the last space, in this case #58(!). See screenshot from my main display (MBP):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ixLt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Why are all these spaces created, how can I avoid it or even better: how to disable more then 2 spaces.  <comment253035> Two monitors don't ***need*** two spaces. One is quite sufficient; they're happy to share a space [just switch off 'Monitors have separate Spaces' in Mission Control]. Have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/157540/yosemite-auto-creates-multiple-desktops-spaces-on-main-monitor for a similar issue with no actual answer, but some reasonable speculation.
