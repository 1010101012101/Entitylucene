How can I extract multipart iso files in Mac OS X? <body> E.g.:br part1.isobr part2.iso    I know The Unarchiver can extract a single ISO file, but how can I extract multipart ISO files?  <answer26217> If they are in fact multipart ISO images (instead of two independent ISO files), you can concatenate them at a Terminal prompt:  precodecat part1.iso part2.iso &gt;part.iso /code/pre  I have no idea how to do this from a GUI elegantly.  Perhaps wrap that shell command with Applescript?  <comment29899> .iso are CD-ROM images usually. Can't you just mount them by double clicking?
