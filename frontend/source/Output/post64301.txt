How many emails can be associated with one Apple ID FaceTime account? <body> How many different email addresses can be associated with one Apple ID FaceTime account?  <answer64302> As long as those email addresses are not tied up with other Apple IDs, I don't think there is a particular limit.  My FaceTime has 4 emails associated with it - none of them are linked to other Apple IDs -  but when I tried associating a 5th email that was linked to another Apple ID, it would;t let me of course.  <comment75484> Thank you, Does adding additional emails change the primary apple id associated with the password? <comment75488> No, it shouldn't. Your primary email should remain untouched.
