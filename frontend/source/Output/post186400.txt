Testing an iPhone 5C without a battery or screen <body> I have a previously broken iPhone 5c that I removed the offending parts from. The screen was shattered beyond repair, and the battery was in pretty bad condition. I'm planning to buy some new parts and repair it, but I don't want to spend around $100 and find out that other parts are broken and it's non-salvageable.   Is there a way to test the phone, maybe by making it ring or vibrate, without a battery or a screen?   h3Update:/h3 It works, it's charging and vibrating, but it seems to be trying to notify me of something important, as it is vibrating every 3 seconds. is this normal or what  <answer221718> I think on iPhones the 3 second vibrat√≠on indicates a screen problem  <comment220027> You could switch it to silent, then plug it into iTunes. That might test if it was still at all alive, then see if iTunes sees it at all. <comment220038> @Tetsujin I plugged it in and iTunes doesn't seem to recognize its existence. Is there any way I could apply power to the phone without a battery? That might work. <comment220039> only using another battery of the same rating <comment220041> Okay, I went and dug the old battery out of the trash and I think I can reattach it and use it. Although I don't know if it's safe to do so since, well, it was in not-so-good condition when I took apart the phone, and it's been in the trash for a day, so now the casing is a bit wrinkled and it's slightly bent. It's not leaking acid or anything, but will it explode and kill me or something if I attach and charge it? <comment220042> Try it let us know ;) <comment220046> @Tetsujin if you don't hear from me within the next 24 hours assume I'm dead <comment220050> Attached the battery and plugged in the phone, I'm not sure whether it's charging fine or the battery is broken. I'll wait a little while and try to text it <comment220059> okay the phone seems to work because it suddenly started vibrating, unfortunately it keeps vibrating every 3 or 4 seconds and I don't know if this is supposed to happen or what? help <comment268530> Welcome to Ask Different.
