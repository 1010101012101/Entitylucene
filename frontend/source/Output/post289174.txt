iBooks appearing to delete all books after downloading a book by James Lee Burke <body> When I down load "Bitterroot" a novel by Jame Lee Burke it appears to erase all of the content of my other 60+ books.  When I delete it I still have to reboot my iPad to see by book's content.  Same same happens on my iPhone.
