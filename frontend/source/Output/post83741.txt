Mac OS X Lion - How do I turn a "regular" user account into a service account? <body> During the installation of PostgreSQL using the installer provided by EnterpriseDB, I was given the option to assign a password to the codePostgreSQL/code account. The installer said something about the account becoming "locked" if I don't assign a password. I didn't know what it meant, so I gave a password. Now I know what it was all about: the installer was actually talking about emservice account/em vs emregular account/em. Now the codePostgreSQL/code account appears in the login screen and it's an eyesore. What shall I do to turn it back into just a service account and make it disappear from the login screen? I'm guessing it involves using codedscl/code?  <answer84066> A simpler thing to do will be to hide the user from the Login Window. Apple provides a few options on this support article.  <comment96708> But still leaves it loginable without the logging of sudo
