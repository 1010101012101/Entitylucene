Shortcut to insert actual date into MS Excel <body> I am using the actual MS Excel 2016 on Mac.  Excel on Windows has the shortcut KBDCtrl/KBDKBD./KBD to insert the actual date into the current field.  On Mac I was not able to find this or another shortcut.  I know this comparing list but at least on german Office-Edition the short cut is as noted above, in the link it is KBDCtrl/KBDKBD;/KBD.    I am able to insert the actual time with KBDCtrl/KBDKBD;/KBD and even KBDCtrl/KBDKBD:/KBD.  Update: It is (german) MacOS 10.12.3, running on a Mac with german keyboard.  MS-Excel 15.30 (also german version).  Is there any similar shortcut on the german MS-Excel on Mac to insert the actual date?  h1Edit/h1  Still without an answer, I am curious, if there isn't a solution?    Has anyone ever wrote a Macro or something similar?  <comment347793> To which language is macOS set to? Is it German? <comment347796> @oa yes, correct.  German MacOS 10.12.3, german keyboard, Excel 15.30 <comment347798> @klanomath It is Office-2016 and (at least on german Mac/Office) it does not work :-( <comment347800> In Excel for Mac 2011 the keyboard shortcut worked just fine in the German translation. It *does not work* with the German keyboard layout selected in Excel for Max 2016.
