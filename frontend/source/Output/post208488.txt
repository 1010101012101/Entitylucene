El Captain update download doesn't continue after restarting the Mac <body> I started to download the El Capitan upgrade, but then I shut down my computer. The day after I wanted to continue the download but in App Store it shows "Waiting..." and doesn't do anything. Also when I go to the updates section, it shows the button "Download" but it's inactive. Maybe someone can help me? I tried to find the download file in some directory to delete it and start over but I couldn't find it.  <answer208514> I've found the solution:  ol liClose the "App Store" App/li liOpen "Terminal"/li liEnter codedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true/code/li liOpen the "App Store" app/li liNow you have in the menu-item "Debug" - open it - and open "Show Download Folder"/li liDelete all files and folders in the folder "com.apple.appstore"/li liClose the "App Store" app/li liRestart the Mac/li liClean the trash bin/li liOpen the "App Store" app an repeat the download./li /ol  Now the download should work!  If you want to hide the debug-menu again just enter in Terminal:br codedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool false/code  <answer208572> In App Store, selecting Store  Check for Unfinished Downloads did work for me.  <comment251484> We encourage jeopardy questions where you ask a question and then answer it.

I think this is a valid reason to post a new question. <comment251526> Very good. Thanks for posting the answer. <comment251527> +1 This solved my case. My Mac was stuck at `Waiting` stage for 24 hrs, and now it's running after I did this. <comment251620> Restarting AppStore a couple of times did the job. <comment251706> **I have the same problem. Where can I find the "TERMINAL", to be able to proceed???** <comment251707> Open your "Applications" folder, then open the "Utilities" folder. Open the "Terminal" application. <comment251892> That did the trick. Thank you! <comment252428> The only thing that worked for me was running "Install OS X El Capitan" from the /Applications folder -- that was apparently left there as a result of one of my many Download attempts from the App Store. <comment253605> this is the right answer.  Worked perfectly. <comment267303> Didn't work for me, clearing the downloads folder did. <comment283966> No `Debug` option available. <comment295465> This also worked for me. Thanks. <comment301872> A shorter version of this: 'Show download folder', close the app store app, delete the 'com.apple.appstore' folder, empty the trash, start the app store app again. No restart required. <comment309177> This was what I had to do to get El Capitan to download. No restart required, though.
