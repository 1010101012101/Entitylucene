How do I remove black rectangles on the desktop screen in os x 10.8? <body> Shown to the left of the screen, on the middle.  Moving a window over it does not remove it, however restarting does. But then they reappear after a while.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hVdNQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment106209> Can you edit the question to mention what Mac or graphics cards you have or add any relevant log messages? Have you tried quitting background applications or other processes? <comment106225> Interesting but not enough information to track it down. Please run the Apple hardware test http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509
