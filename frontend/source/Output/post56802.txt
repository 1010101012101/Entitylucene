Accessing ~/Documents on Lion server through the web server <body> I currently have the server active on a static ip. Upon logging on you are met with  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIzYv.png" alt="Screen Shot" What I need to be able to do is access certain folders on the mac via the web front end (as shown below). There is the facility to share documents but I can't work out how to allow access to internal folders? I would also like to point out the standard file sharing via afp or smp is not possible.  <comment65229> Is there any reason why you want to share ~/Documents and not a dedicated web root? While possible, it requires setting read access for all. <comment65231> You have given me an idea. What if I found the folder where the documents are stored documents in the my page link shooed above, then added an alias to the file I need the web user to be able to access? Do you know where these files are stored?
