ExpressCard SSD continusouly indexing <body> I've had a 48GB SSD in my ExpressCard slot on my '09 17" MBP for the last 8-9 months and haven't had a problem up until this past week.  When I look at spotlight it says that it is indexing the SSD, and it won't stop.  I've left the laptop on over the weekend and I come back and its doing the same thing.  Is there a way to fix this?  If there is no obvious method, is there a way to at least turn of indexing for this drive?  <answer152602> The simplest [yet not only] way to prevent Spotlight indexing a drive is...  ol liConnect the volume or drive you want excluded to your Mac.  /li liOpen the System Preferences application. /li liClick on Spotlight, then click on the Privacy tab. /li liDrag your volume or drive into the Privacy menu to exclude it./li /ol
