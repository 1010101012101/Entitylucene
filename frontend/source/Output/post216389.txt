MacBook not recognizing Wireless N USB Adapter <body> I have an aluminum unibody (2008). I recently upgraded RAM &amp; downloaded all software to get my baby up to date. THEN the wifi card died. I tried to fix that myself but thanks to Apple's almost spot-welded screws, I had to change directions. I got the usb adapter's drivers installed &amp; when I inserted the adapter, I got nothing. NOTHING. Can someone please help this old lady? I just paid $35 to the local computer guy to remove a stripped screw. I'm trying really hard to not have to see him ever again. All I want is to use my MacBook again &amp; throw this PC back in the corner.  HELP!!  <answer216398> It might be an alteration in the USB ports. Try checking them out first.   <comment261681> Sorry, but I have no idea what that means. :/
