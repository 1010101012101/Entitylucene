Monitor connected via DVI-to-Thunderbolt requires minutes of jiggling before it is recognized <body> I am connecting a Dell G2410 monitor to my Macbook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) via a DVI-to-Thunderbolt adapter.  However, whenever I plug it in, I have to spend at least a few minutes jiggling the cable before the mac finally recognizes the monitor.  Additionally, the slightest touch will cause the connection to be lost and another few minutes of jiggling before the monitor is recognized again.  Is this a known issue and is there anything I can do to avoid spending so much of my day fiddling with the cable?  <comment167372> I have the same issue however I can't get my mid-2012 rMBP to recognize this monitor at all when connected via DVI. Works fine with VGA, but just a black screen with DVI adaptor. Any one have any suggestions? <comment167381> Have you done anything to determine whether this is a problem with the cable?  Smells like it could be a hardware issue with the cable or connectors (e.g., that they are making a flaky or imperfect physical connection). <comment167391> The laptop seems to recognize the adapter more consistently when it has some torque.  I think it may be sitting in the port without making contact.
