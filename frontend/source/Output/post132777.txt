Upgrade MacBook Pro Bluetooth <body> Is there a way to upgrade my MacBook Pro late 2011 MacBook Pro 13" Bluetooth to Bluetooth 4.0 without using a usb extension? As I only have one working USB port.  <answer132779> I do not see a way to do that.  Aside of software/firmware from Apple, there is the hardware issue as well.  <answer235405> QuickerTek makes a card that replaces the Apple WiFi/Bluetooth card. A bit pricey at $149: http://www.quickertek.com/products/Ucard.html This works in 2011-2012 13" and 15" MacBook Pros (non-retina). The version for 2011-2012 MacBook Pros (non-Retina) uses Apple's driver.
