My Apple devices always seem to slow down over the years <body> It seems like every time I buy an Apple product the speed of it always slows down. I bought an iPod a year or two ago and the speed at which it launches apps and runs the apps have slowed down. Is there any way to fix this? Like buy an iPhone and it will never slow down?  <answer275692> You have several options to fight against the slackening of your devices (or the perception of it):  ul lidon't install apps (especially apps bloating over time because of feature updates)/li lidon't use faster and newer devices of the same kind (or better: the older your own devices get, ask friends or colleagues to lend to you their much older and slower devices more frequently and use them and you will happily return to your own "faster" device)/li liget old faster than your devices (or reduce the perception of speediness or responsiveness artificially)/li litake Zen lessons/li /ul  <answer275700> In addition to what klanomath suggests, another option is to do a full backup, erase, and restore.  By this I mean do a full backup to iTunes on your computer. Once you've done this, go to your iPod and do the following:  ul liTap on Settings/li liTap on General/li liSwipe up/li liTap on Reset/li liTap on Erase All Content and Settings/li liEnter your passcode to go through the process/li liReconnect your iPod to iTunes on your computer/li liOpt to restore the backup you made earlier/li /ul  This process should improve your iPod's responsiveness etc  <comment346837> +1 for zen lessons <comment346843> Can you expand on this and explain what you've already tried to do to fix this? Otherwise you may get suggestions to do what you've already tried! Also, you need to provide more details: we have no idea what model iPod, what version of iOS it's running, how much space you still have on it, etc. <comment346854> Add to this clearing, or apps that do not clear the cache. An app can also leave large amounts of data in your clipboard without you knowing about it. That is until you to a copy/paste and see immediate improvement. The mail program on iPad is like this. The amount of space it takes grows even when you delete gigs worth of data. <comment346857> Also not installing updates if possible <comment346863> Without a specific device or a specific measure of slowness, this likely it too subjective to be open long term on the site. Let's put a hold on i case you have a specific so and specific measurement in mind.
