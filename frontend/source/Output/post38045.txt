How do I set my mac to ask what disc I want to boot from without having to hold alt? <body> I can switch between OSX, Windows and a network drive, but I cannot seem to find this option anywhere.  <answer38047> h1rEFIt/h1     rEFIt is a boot menu and maintenance toolkit for EFI-based machines like the Intel Macs. You can use it to boot multiple operating systems easily, including triple-boot setups with Boot Camp. It also provides an easy way to enter and explore the EFI pre-boot environment.    ul lirEFIt allows you to sync partition tables/li licustomize:  ul liset default  to boot from/li lidefine wait time before a boot option is selected /li liconfigure the rEFIt boot screen/li /ul/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cEAyS.jpg" alt="http://macthemes.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16802124"  <answer38048> You can use rEFIt, which will automatically present you with all boot options when you install it to the OS X Volume (see this article for more detail).  <answer38049> There's a System Preference pane called Startup Disk  (Apple  System Preferences  Startup Disk) that allows you to choose which disk to start up from.
