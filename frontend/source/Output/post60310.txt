Is there a app or software to do random photo selection on iphone or mac? <body> I am looking for an app on iphone to do this:  ol liI can select a bunch of photos into the app/li liI click a button/li liThen the app will randomly pick a photo from what I have selected and show up in the screen./li /ol  If possible the app could quickly slide through all the photos I have selected and randomly stop at one of them.  This app is very useful in a party and when people want to do a raffle gift drawing.  Is there such an app there?  <answer60315> The built in slideshow would work to set the order of photos to random if you've already classified the photos into an album. Just set the delay to a while and remember to re-choose the album to re-seed the randomness if you choose to repeat the selection.  If you need to classify photos on the go, you can use the iPhoto app to import / sort / add / remove photos from a group and then set up your random slide show for the ordering of them at random.  As a bonus, you can play music if desired while you set things up. I don't know of an app to provide your slot machine animation but perhaps someone can find just that app on the store for you.
