My Finder doesn't function normally and I have to relaunch it repeatedly to view content <body> This is a problem I noticed today. I never saw it happen previously.  Today when I open a Finder, the content is not correctly displayed. Initially it looks like that the Finder is transparent and the background behind the window is shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LSyC0.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I drag and resize the window, I'll get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rdllz.png" alt="enter image description here"  (shrug...)  In order to fix it, I need to press the codeOption/code key, right click the Finder icon to relaunch it. After a relaunch, everything works correctly strongfor a few seconds/strong and then it's broken again! I have to relaunch repeatedly in order to access my files.  I've tried to restarted my laptop several times but it still doesn't work normally.  I'm using strongOS X Version 10.9.5/strong.  strongCould somebody give some hint of how to fix that??/strong Could it be virus or malware?? Thank you very much!  =====  strongUPDATE on 08/29/2016:/strong  According to @Tetsujin who commented below, I quit Google Drive app and everything went well again!  strongUPDATE #2 on 08/29/2016:/strong  Jim Becker was asking about where to find the "Finder". Here is a screenshot below. The finder is located on the left-most side of the dock bar (if the bar is at the bottom of your screen).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0yVb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment310279> If you log in as a different user (you may have to create a new user to try), does it still happen <comment310286> @samh Interesting.. I just created a new user and logged in, and everything seems to work fine. I didn't see the problem happen for the new user. <comment310305> Try quitting Google Drive if it happens again & let us know the result. <comment310308> This is the one I was looking for - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153260/finder-doesnt-work-since-yosemite?noredirect=1&lq=1 <comment310423> @Tetsujin: Amazing... I quit Google Drive and everything works fine! <comment310426> I was afraid that might be the answer... it actually means I don't know what the 'fix' is except to try -- update the OS to something more recent, perhaps see if Google Drive has an update, work without Google Drive... or... live with it. <comment311688> @Tetsujin Thanks for your...'guess', anyway. :-D That's the best "guess" I've seen so far! If you don't mind, you can add your answer below and I'll accept it. <comment312358> I've found a more complete answer to a similar question, so I'm going to flag this one as a duplicate - that way, anyone Googling will have a better chance of finding an answer, as the posts will then be linked. <comment312363> @Tetsujin I read that post and yes I think we were having the same problem and could fix it by quitting Google Drive desktop client.
