Siri has wrong phone number for my Company <body> I am a receptionist at a large Healthcare company.  I manage phone calls from employees only not the public.  Siri is providing my office line as the main line for the company.  How can this be fixed?  <comment341367> Apple has a service to update your information - see the linked question for details about https://mapsconnect.apple.com
