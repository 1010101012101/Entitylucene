When adding passwords to Keychain Access from command line NTLM is converted to MLTN <body> This is one of the weirdest things...  I script adding passwords to Keychain Access when I log in to provide a "SSO" like experience. I use AppleScript to run some terminal commands that look like this†:  precodesecurity add-internet-password -a $LOGNAME -j 'default' -s '$SHAREPOINT' -r htps -P 443 \ -T /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari \ -T /Applications/Microsoft\ Office\ 2011/Microsoft\ Document\ Connection.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft\ Document\ Connection \ -d '$SHAREPOINT' -w $PASSWORD -t 'ntlm' /code/pre  Note that I have to use NTLM authentication for it to work right with MS Office apps.  However, when I do this, I get a keychain that looks like this (irrelevant lines trimmed)  precodekeychain: "/Users/.../Library/Keychains/login.keychain" class: "inet" attributes:     "ptcl"&lt;uint32&gt;="http"     "sdmn"&lt;blob&gt;="sharepoint site"     "srvr"&lt;blob&gt;="sharepoint site"     "atyp"&lt;blob&gt;="mltn" /code/pre  Note that the value for codeatyp/code "ntlm" was reversed to mltn. When I try and connect to Sharepoint it doesn't work. However, if I use the same command but change the last part to code-t 'mltn'/code then it works!  precodekeychain: "/Users/.../Library/Keychains/login.keychain" class: "inet" attributes:     "ptcl"&lt;uint32&gt;="http"     "sdmn"&lt;blob&gt;="sharepoint site"     "srvr"&lt;blob&gt;="sharepoint site"     "atyp"&lt;blob&gt;="ntlm" /code/pre  See here that codeatyp/code has been reversed to 'ntlm' which allows MS Office apps to log in!  So I have a workaround, but I certainly feel yucky using it. Is there something I'm doing wrong here?  em†The $PASSWORD variable is actually retrieved by prompting the user with a dialog so that they can type it once and pre-authenticate to several important websites in a single shot./em  <comment157822> I've confirmed this happens on both Mountain Lion and Mavericks. <comment157924> I've filed a bug with Apple, it is ID 17211381 and I will update this if I get a response.
