OSX tries to finish an update after login, hangs at completion then shuts down <body> Yesterday I restarted my MacBook Pro and it started installing updates after I logged in again. The problem is it does not complete. It fills up to 100 %, then hangs for like 10 minutes and ultimately shuts down. When I power on the MacBook Pro again the same happens cycle is about to take place.  I tried to reset the NVRAM and also to check the disk using kbdCommand/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd. It seems I have DataVault enabled and I am also unable to unlock the drive. When I try to reinstall OS X/macOS – where I have already accepted data loss – I can not complete the task because of the locked drive. When I unlock the drive using my correct password, the main drive disappears.  I have tried to fire up the MacBook Pro in safe mode and also logged in as a guest user. The laptop just can not complete the login process for my user.  What can I do to resolve  <comment342973> I'm not quite sure I understand what happens when you try to unlock your partition in Disk Utility from the Recovery Partition. It won't accept your password? Did you check the keyboard layout is correct? <comment342976> The main problem is that afer I login the laptop doesnt start. It tries to complete an update, but never completes and shuts down. Im trying to fix that in a way I can use my laptop again. <comment342978> OK. But, it is not clear to me why you cannot reinstall macOS from the Recovery Partition. Why can't you unlock your macOS partition? What happens exactly? <comment344235> When I unlock the partition it disappears from the selection list on which partition I want to reinstall. I've fixed it by entirely removing the partition, recreating a new one and reinstall OSX on that partition. Too bad my data is all gone, but most of it was in a cloud backup.
