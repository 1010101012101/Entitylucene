How to get private key on IOS used for SSL traffic? <body> I need to debug/view an IOS app's encrypted traffic, so i had captured SSL encrypted TCP packets via pirni. and trying to decrypt them via Wireshark. but i need session key for that. is there any way to export private key in IOS to be used with wireshark as in PKCS format?  <answer118433> The private key in any SSL connection is on the emserver/em.  Even if there were a private key on the client, it's only used for emauthentication/em not emencryption/em.  <comment138316> Yes you were right. Thank you. I was looking at wrong type of keys. session keys were right, not private keys.
