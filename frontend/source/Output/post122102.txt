Why localhost works even apache is off? <body> I installed ZendServer CE. This is my /usr/local/zend/apache2/conf/httpd.conf file: http://codepad.org/vorWrTKb  This is my /etc/hosts file.  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost fe80::1%losd0   localhost /code/pre  Document root is strong/Users/anthony/apache/html/strong  If I turn zend server off http:/localhost/ still works. Moreover I have another web-site (php) here /Users/anthony/apache/html/somesite and it also still works on localhost.  At the same time I haven't any virtual hosts in /usr/local/zend/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf having that documentRoot.  This is my httpd-vhosts.conf file http://codepad.org/qx20aZua  I checked default apache macos service and removed file from /etc/apache2 httpd.conf.  strongIf ZendServer is on:/strong  127.0.0.1 runs /Users/anthony/apache/html/ (correct)  localhost runs /Users/anthony/apache/html/somesite (it shouldn't)  strongIf ZendServer is off:/strong  127.0.0.1 runs /Users/anthony/apache/html/somesite (it shouldn't)  localhost runs /Users/anthony/apache/html/somesite (it shouldn't)  So I cannot understand how localhost works if apache doesn't?  <answer122127> The problem was solved.  I run emps aux | grep httpd/em and got a lot of process. I've killed each process and restarted ZS. Now it's ok)
