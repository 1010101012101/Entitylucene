How do I access and view cache HTML5 videos located in Safari or Chrome cache? <body> I want to view and possibly remix a video on youtube.  I have seen many demos and articles describing where the cache is on older versions of the browsers, but now it seems that Safari is stored in a .db file, and I haven't figured out chrome.  How can I extract and save an HTML5 file in a way so that I can view it later, or edit it in a video editing program?  <answer131032> If you just want to download a video, you can use youtube-dl.
