Keyboard shortcut to navigate/cycle between visible windows on screen <body> I have two windows(e.g a document and a browser). I have maximized them such that the document completely occupies the left half and the browser completely occupies the right half of the screen ( I do this easily with the keyboard shortcuts of Spectacle)  What is the keyboard shortcut to navigate quickly between these two visible windows?  Cmd + Tab is not ideal because if I use multiple virtual desktops(like workspaces in Linux) and I go to a third application there in another desktop, when I come back to the virtual desktop which contains my browser and document, Cmd + Tab brings in the third application to the mix.  Cmd+Space and then typing the application name(e.g the browser application or the document application) is the closest I could get to what I originally wanted.  Is there a software or configuration that I can use to get this functionality?  <answer157477> Those would be  kbdControl/kbd+kbdF4/kbd - Move focus to the active (or next) window  kbdShift/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdF4/kbd - Move focus to the previously active window  If you have the "F keys as standard function keys" option disabled in System Preferences  Keyboard, enable it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jRPpu.jpg" alt="Setting in System Preferences to enable F-keys"  Or use kbdFn/kbd in addition to the above shortcuts.
