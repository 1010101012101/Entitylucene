Aquamacs Emacs Macbook Pro Power Consumption <body> Whenever I launch Aquamacs (Emacs) on my 2015 Macbook Pro, I begin hearing the fan run intensely after about 5 minutes. When I click on the battery icon in the menu bar, it tell me that Aquamacs is using significant energy. Is there a way to prevent this? I tried installing the newest version of the software but it behaves the same.  I am confused since this should be a basic editor. Does it mean that the software is not designed well?
