Replace logic board on MacBook pro retina early 2013 <body> i have to replace my broken logic board on my MacBook Pro retina display early 2013. I am wondering what alternatives I have: since I have to replace it, can I also speed it up with something from the late 2013 or 2014 series? Where can I order replacements? I tried fixit.com, but they only have a used 8GB board.  <answer171088> Inquire at [Other World Computing].1 They will know which part and why.   The classic resource for complete info on every Apple machine is everymac.com.  <comment201353> thanks for the info, but it looks like OWC does not have logic board replacements... <comment257810> Why do you have to replace the logic board?
