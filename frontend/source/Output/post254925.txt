Why can't I create a directory under /opt without sudo? <body> Mac 10.11.5 (El Capitan) here. I just tried creating a directory under code/opt/code:  precodemyUser$ mkdir /opt/bupo mkdir: /opt/bupo: Permission denied /code/pre  Why would I need to prefix this with codesudo/code and then authenticate myself in order for this command to work? If I emwere/em to use codesudo mkdir /opt/bupo/code, then what user would actually be creating + owning this codebupo//code directory, would it be coderoot/code?  <answer254931> Only the root user can write to the root of the file system. So, it is safe to assume that the code/opt/code directory is owned by root. The default codeumask/code would make that directory read, write, and executable to the owner; read and executable to the group; read and executable to others/everyone.  If you use codesudo mkdir /opt/bupo/code the directory would be owned by the root user.
