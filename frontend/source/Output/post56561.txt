How do I find the windowid to pass to screencapture -l? <body> The command line utility screencapture claims to be able to capture a single window without requiring interaction, but I can't figure out what to pass it.  precode-l&lt;windowid&gt; capture this windowsid /code/pre  It's not the process id of the the application.  <answer56566> For some applications you can use AppleScript:  precodescreencapture -l$(osascript -e 'tell app "Safari" to id of window 1') test.png /code/pre  It doesn't work with Chrome though.  The IDs are also shown in Quartz Debug (available from developer.apple.com/downloads) if you run codedefaults write com.apple.QuartzDebug QuartzDebugPrivateInterface -bool true/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQR7N.png" alt=""  <answer92944> I wrote a little command line utility to retrieve the Window ID for apps that don't support AppleScript.  Get it here: https://github.com/smokris/GetWindowID  You can then capture a specific window by specifying its bundle name and window title:  precodescreencapture -l$(./GetWindowID "Vuo Editor" "untitled composition") VuoEditorWindow.png /code/pre  <answer177808> I wrote a command line utility that wraps over codescreencapture/code and the Quartz windowing library.  Grab it here: https://github.com/thismachinechills/pyscreencapture  Use it like this:  precode./screencapture.py Chrome -t Stack Overflow /code/pre  <comment64954> Unfortunately, this doesn't work with non-Applescriptable apps like Eclipse or Google Chrome. <comment64957> Yeah, my target app is not Applescriptable :(  But thank you anyway. <comment69493> Note that window ids are not guaranteed to correspond to the Quartz window id even in applications that are scriptable. <comment119060> Hi, I'm trying to use it but I'm not sure on what I'm doing. I've downloaded the Makefile,GetWindowID.m. But when I launch the command ./GetWindowID.m it gives me this error:./GetWindowID.m: line 4: syntax error near unexpected token `(' ./GetWindowID.m: line 4: `int main(int argc, char **argv)' <comment121262> @Giorgio: Open a Terminal window and change to the folder that contains `Makefile` and `GetWindowID.m`, then run the command `make`.  It will produce a binary called `GetWindowID`, which you can then invoke using the command I described in my answer. <comment241863> Have you missed double-quote?
