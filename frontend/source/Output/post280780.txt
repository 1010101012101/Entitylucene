python config conflict in brew doctor and symlinks wrong for which python <body> I believe some previous symlinking has messed up my versions of python.  I have codeminiconda3/code and want my default python version to be 3.5 (ideally link my default python2.7 on Mac OS to a miniconda installation). I want to also manage multiple conda environments. I also have a codebrew install/code of python3 and python.  When doing codewhich python/code I get:  code/usr/local/bin/python/code  rather than:  code/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/code  And doing codebrew doctor/code gives me:  precodeWarning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories. `./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when compiling and linking.  Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:   /Users/dhruv/miniconda3/bin/python3-config   /Users/dhruv/miniconda3/bin/python3.6-config   /Users/dhruv/miniconda3/bin/python3.6m-config /code/pre  I was also having a warning as described in this post which was solved via changing the default $PATH prepending that miniconda did so that it rather just appended to my $PATH.  What am I doing wrong to get my error with the python configs and the wrong codewhich python/code?  strongAdditional info/strong  When doing codels -l /usr/local/bin/python/code I get:  codelrwxr-xr-x  1 dhruv  admin  34 14 Apr 20:46 /usr/local/bin/python -&gt; ../Cellar/python/2.7.13/bin/python/code so there seems to be a link anyways.  I also have nothing in code/Library/Frameworks//code such as a codePython.framework/Versions/code folder.  My path is now:  precode/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/Users/dhruv/miniconda3/bin:/Users/dhruv/miniconda3/bin /code/pre
