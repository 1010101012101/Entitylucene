Pinch to lock iPhone <body> I've been having issues with my iPhone 5's lock button recently, I'm having to press it more forcefully to get it to work. Then I saw this video and got to a part where the person does a pinch gesture to lock his phone.   Is this a feature to iPhone 5S only or can this be unlocked through some set up in accessibility?  <answer126523> It's a custom gesture set up on the jailbroken iPhone. Pinch to lock is not a feature available in Accessibility or any other method on a non-jailbroken phone.  The gesture can be set up using a tweak such as Activator. Go to Settings → Activator → On Lock Screen → Icon Pinch → Lock Device to set it up.  <comment148229> I'm pretty sure that he's using a custom gesture on a jailbroken iPhone. <comment148230> Ah alright, I just noticed the jailbroken app store in the bottom corner. Thanks <comment148236> if you are adventurous you might be able to get your button working again with a bit of wd40
