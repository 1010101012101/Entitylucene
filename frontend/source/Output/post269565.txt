How do I allow the opening of all applicatiosn from a specific website? <body> I frequently download from an unidentified developer, and I want to be able to always allow opening downloads from them. How can I do so?  However, I don't want to keep an option to allow apps downloaded from anywhere, although on a side note that option seems to have strangely disappeared.  <answer269605> This is the only option I'm aware of:  ol liNavigate to 'System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General'/li liClick the lock on the bottom left of the window and enter an admin password/li liClick the radio button that says 'Anywhere'/li liClick the lock in the bottom left of the window again to prevent further changes/li /ol  You would have to remember to go back and change it though when you're done downloading applications from that specific website/developer. Yes, it's a pain, but you could set a reminder for yourself with a date on it so that your Mac can remind you to change it back at a certain time!  <comment338613> I don't think that is possible.  There is a reason it is called an "unidentified developer."  How do you plan to identify the difference between the 2? <comment338618> @William I'd think their is some way. At the very least, mark a certain website safe. <comment338619> Where do you think the website data or url would be stored?  I would 1st ask a question how to disable it either per download or universally but that is just my 2 cents. <comment338620> @William You used to be able to allow downloads from anywhere, but they recently removed the option. Anyways, it's not what I desire. <comment338763> 'Anywhere' is still an option for me in Sierra, though I have heard others mention it's gone. Maybe the simplest alternative is just the regular 'right click  Open' for first launch ?
