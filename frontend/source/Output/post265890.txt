Print Apple Calendar with Photo <body> It’s easy enough to print from the Apple Calendar app. The question is, is there some way of adding a photo to the top, like a printed wall calendar.  There are plenty of apps which print generic calendars with your own photos, and the photos app will also send off photos to be printed. What I want is to be able to print off my own schedule with a decorative photo on it.  Happy enough to use a third party app, as long as it does the job (and isn’t too expensive).
