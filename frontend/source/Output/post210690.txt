Does iCloud Calendar Backup Include Local (Non iCloud) Calendars? <body> strongFirst/strong, my basic question:  If I have an iPhone and it is using a local calendar (em"On This Phone"/em, I think), strongand/strong my backup is to iCloud, does that backup include the local calendar?  Edit: to be clear, the backup I'm referring to is:  codeiCloud.com &gt; Settings &gt; (Advanced section) &gt; Restore Calendars and Reminders/code  strongSecond/strong, and the reason for my question:  I've performed a series of steps that's left me in a mess with migrating a local calendar to an iCloud calendar whilst also (around the same time) sharing iCloud calendars between two users...  The sequence has been something close to this (unfortunately I didn't note them down 100% as I was going):  ul liiPhone A and iPhone B, separate Apple IDs, both backing up to iCloud/li liiPhone A uses iCloud calendars, only/li liiPhone B uses a local calendar, but also has an iCloud calendar containing some events that were invites from iPhone A/li liiPhone A shares an iCloud calendar with iPhone B. It all works as expected. The calendar is name "Calendar"/li liiPhone B considers sharing a calendar with iPhone A, but realises they're using a local calendar, so goes through the process of merging/migrating that local data to be in an iCloud calendar/li liem(I think, this was achieved by turning on the Calendar option in the iCloud settings, then answering "yes" to "do you want to keep local calendar data?")/em/li liiPhone B now has iCloud calendars only; the iPhone B user checks on their Mac and they now see the iCloud calendar on their, too. Yay!/li liiPhone B now shares their iCloud calendar with iPhone A. The calendar is named "Calendar"/li liThis time, the sharing from iPhone B to iPhone A only emkinda/em works. New events on iPhone B are immediately propagated to iPhone A. However, existing events on iPhone B are not seen on iPhone A (this was emnot/em the case when iPhone A was shared to iPhone B)/li liUpon seeing this, the users of iPhone A and iPhone B tried things like: un-sharing and re-sharing, re-naming calendars, re-synching... None of which worked./li liUnfortunately, a side effect of the above was that (and I'm not sure at what point it happened) - the existing events on iPhone B became readonly on iPhone B. New events on iPhone B went into the re-named calendar. So, the calendar on iPhone B was renamed from "Calendar" to "Ciara". Existing events were listed as being under "Calender" and new events were listed as being in "Ciara".../li liFurther un-sharing and showing/hiding calendars resulted in the pre-existing events on iPhone B disappearing completely.../li /ul  Note:  ul liUnfortunately, I did not export any of the calendars before doing this (I know, I should have)/li /ul  What I've tried:  ul liI've tried un-sharing all calendars, then using iCloud.com for iPhone B's account to restore a calendar (only) from before any of the above was started/li liIt did not work/li liHowever, at the time of that backup, the codeCalendar/code option in codeSettings -&gt; iCloud/code was turned off. When trying to restore the calendar via iCloud.com, the codeCalendar/code option is still turned strongon/strong/li /ul  What I'd like to try:  ul liTurn that setting off, so iPhone B is not using iCloud calendars/li liRestore a calendar backup from iCloud.com/li liIf it works, and I see the pre-existing events, first do an export, and second try to migrate to iCloud calendars on iPhone B embefore/em doing any sharing/li /ul  The reason for this question:  ul liiPhone B belongs to my wife ;)/li liI've already lost a whole load of her events; I don't want to mess it up further ;)/li liI'll try the above, if I know that the older iCloud calendar backups will have contained the local, calendar data.../li /ul  Thanks  <answer211111> Following some trial and error, and additional reasoning, I can partially answer my own question:  (1) The events from a local calendar, on an iPhone (em"On This Phone"/em, I think it is referred to), are not backed up to the emcalendar-specfic/em area in iCloud. Here:  codeiCloud.com &gt; Settings &gt; (Advanced section) &gt; Restore Calendars and Reminders/code  Although it doesn't say so explicitly, it makes sense that these iCloud calendar backups cover a user's emiCloud calendars/em. (Plus, my attempt to restore such backups with a hope to see pre-merged, local calendars, failed).  Screen shot from iCloud.com:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7b3Jk.png" alt="enter image description here"  (2) The emiPhone backup/em (the complete backup of the whole phone), which in my case was being backed up to iCloud (rather than iTunes), would, I presume, include the local calendars and their events.  However, by time I'd got to looking at this, my oldest 'complete' iCloud backup was just a day old... which was after I merged the local calendars into iCloud calendars.
