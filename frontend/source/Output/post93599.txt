Does iPod Touch 5th gen 16GB (mid 2013) still have built-in Camera app for use with front-facing camera? <body> Recall: At the end of May, Apple introduced a lower-cost iPod Touch (5th generation, mid 2013) with just 16GB of storage, in one color (silver), no hand-strap, and no iSight rear-facing camera &ndash; but the front FaceTime camera remains.  So:  ul liDoes this low-cost model of the iPod Touch 5th gen still ship with the iOS built-in "Camera" app, for use with the front-facing FaceTime camera that remains?/li /ul  I'm asking because this is the first iOS device that has emonly/em a front-facing camera, and I'm not sure if it is for FaceTime emonly/em, or if the camera can still be used for stills and video (facing the user's direction, of course.)  Thanks!  <answer94321> The answer is strongyes/strong &mdash; the iPod touch 5th gen 16GB emdoes/em still have the Camera app. Here's confirmation direct from Apple's recently-updated iPod touch manual:  ul listrongiPod touch User Guide - For iOS 6.1 Software (June 2013) [PDF]/strong/li /ul  In Chapter 9, strong"Camera"/strong, on page 54, it states:     With iPod touch, you can take both still photos and videos, using the   FaceTime camera on the front or the camera on the back (available on   some models).   There's also an accompanying image showing the built-in Camera app's user interface, and notes indicating controls for the flash and to "Switch between cameras" may not be available on some models:  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t1RHZ.png" alt="Apple iPod touch Camera app UI capture from manual"  hr  Finally, I've also learned that third-party apps that use cameras on iOS devices should continue to function strongprovided/strong they use the iOS APIs emcorrectly/em &mdash; as demonstrated in Apple sample code &mdash; to strongquery/strong the device for camera capability and the available cameras.  (When a third-party app assumes a rear-facing camera is emalways/em available on a camera-supporting device, such an app won't necessarily operate correctly on the iPod touch 5th gen 16GB.)
