Spell-check doesn't work on words with dashes (Mail.app in Yosemite) <body> I just upgraded to Yosemite, and noticed that in Mail.app spell check (as you type) doesn't work properly if two words are connected by a dash (hyphen) and only the second one is misspelled. For example:  ol litest-test (no squiggly)/li litest-asdf (no squiggly)/li liasdf-test (squiggly on first word)/li liasdf-asdf (squiggly on first word)/li /ol  Here #2 should get a squiggly but it does not. All other applications seem to work as expected (although I'd prefer to have squigglies on both words for #4). I have Mac OS 10.10.2 and Mail.app 8.2 (2070.6).  Any suggestions for workarounds?  <answer179591> This is not a answer...but to show the result of a test  It confirms a problem with using a dash with spell checker in Mail.app and Notes ect... on my MBA with 10.9.5  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X5HXb.jpg" alt="spell check"  The result is sporadic, sometimes if the word before dash is correct it will ignore the word after dash, sometimes not.  Interestingly if I enable check Grammar with Spelling it will work correctly.  <comment212940> What is your setting for spelling? automatic by Language ? or by specific language ? <comment212945> Nothing to do with dashes, it already shows the "asdf" as problem without a dash. <comment212954> US English. The problem is #2, e.g. if you type in "Merriam-Webter" instead of "Merriam-Webster" you want Mail.app to give you a squiggly. <comment212961> You are right, it use the dash to make it one word and ignores the word after dash. But if the word before dash is wrong Webter-Merriam it will show both as incorrect.
