AFP over the internet? <body> I'm using my MBP as a media server, and I'm connecting to it via my MBA through AFP (settings can be found in "File Sharing" tab in System Preferences).  This works fine if I am connecting locally, but I would like to be able to connect over the internet from anywhere.  The other problem is that the MBP is using DHCP and I'd rather not use VNC.  <answer37793> If you sign in with the same iCloud / Apple ID on both systems, and enable File Sharing in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Sharing/code on the Macbook Pro, this is exactly the use case Back To My Mac is supposed to fulfill.  <answer37867> If you setup DynDNS and make sure that your router, firewall etc all are passing TCP port 548, you'll be able to connect from the DynDNS host/domain you create.    AFP over the public Internet isn't a great solution for anything other than very minor, lightweight file transfers, however, and if you're expecting more than a few concurrent users you should really consider a better protocol, such as WebDAV or (S)FTP, much less Dropbox, S3, Box.com, etc.  <answer37871> There's an app called ShareTool that should do what you need.     ul   liShares your network quietly in the background./li   liCan be configured to run as a background daemon./li   liAutomatic recovery from power failure./li   liAll traffic travels through an encrypted SSH tunnel./li   liNo IP addresses or port numbers to remember./li   liAccess your Bonjour services remotely./li   liRemote Printing./li   liiTunes Home Sharing across the web fully supported./li   liConnect to multiple networks at once./li   liSave login information to the Keychain./li   liOn-the-fly compression for maximum performance./li   liBrowse the Web securely from any WiFi hotspot./li   liTransparent SOCKS/HTTPS proxy support./li   liSupports VPN connections./li   liSupports Bonjour over VPN connections./li   liSupport for PPC systems./li   liAnd much more!/li   /ul   It looks like Yazsoft is no more active but Bainsware is continuing with this product.  <answer37880> AFP works over the internet assuming that port 548 is not blocked by your ISP. If you are using a private IP behind a NAT you'll need to forward port 548 to the computer that you want to connect to on the router.  Using DHCP makes this much more difficult.  If the DHCP requirement is so that your computer can join other networks easily, you might want to create a DHCP reservation for your computer on the router so that it always receives the same IP address.    That being said, the AFP experience in the Finder is pretty poor with a slow connection to the server (which is common when connecting over the internet).  Using SFTP (really SSH/Remote Login) or another protocol and a standalone client app such as Transmit or Cyberduck would be a much more responsive experience, but not as integrated as the Finder and AFP.    <comment42902> The other laptop is on Snow Leopard (and needs to stay that way for now), and it looks like you can't use Back to My Mac between Lion and SL: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4867 <comment42951> I ended up using No-IP, but same basic solution.
