Is it possible to search for text in iBooks or the Kindle app? <body> Is it possible to search for text in iBooks or the Kindle app?  I'm deciding whether to buy electronic copies of some of my reference books, but I would only be purchasing them for the ability to search through the books for specific terms and words.  <answer44566> Yes, in both the iBooks and Kindle apps, you strongcan/strong search the full text (excluding text in images) of the book emyou are currently reading/em.  Here's how to do that in each app:  h2iBooks app/h2  While reading a book, tap the screen.  A magnifying glass icon becomes visible in the top right, along with other controls.  Clicking the magnifying glass icon brings up a search box.  After entering your search term in the box, iBooks presents a list of results from the current book, underneath the search box.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ExSsx.png" alt="image if iBooks search"  h2Kindle app/h2  Similarly, while reading a book, tap the screen. At the bottom a magnifying glass icon will become visible.  It works much like the iBooks search feature.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oz2e0.png" alt="image of Kindle.app search"  h2What about searching across all books?/h2  If you wanted to know whether you can enter a search term at the top-level of these apps and have them search across strongall/strong books stored in the app:  strongNo/strong, currently neither iBooks nor the Kindle app have such a feature.  However, I have seen this capability on the Kindle device itself &ndash; I own a Kindle keyboard model and there is a "search my items" option available that will search all books on the device for a given term.  <answer97433> The search function doesn't work on my ipad with the Kindle app - I've tried it with various books. The magnifying glass appears, but will only allow a search on Google and Wikipedia! There are up and down arrows available, but they are 'dulled and dead'.  On the Kindle the search on the same books works fine.  <answer142976> If you are doing it on an iPad you need wifi I had it not work for me because there was no wifi.   When I tried but with wifi it worked. On a phone I also would suggest being sure there is wifi or data and bars.   This is for the kindle app I don't work with iBooks much.  <answer189381> Easy. Convert all your Kindle books to epubs using Calibre. Store the epubs in their own folder. Search the directory  at will.  <answer286272> Search needs improving.  There is no "and" or "or" feature.  And no way to search for a full word.  For example searching for "Ian" will give every word that has those letters in it.  <comment50660> @jaberg Thanks for adding the images :-) <comment141180> This should be two separate question, one for each app <comment168426> sometimes you also have to change how you are searching for a thing in the top bar if you have weird wording or wrong spelling it doesn't work <comment181315> No. When I tap my screen a row of thumbnails pops up, not that menubar you show.
