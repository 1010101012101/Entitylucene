MacBook slow on boot since booting from external disk <body> My MacBook Pro 2017 was lightning fast at startup, then I installed macOS High Sierra on an strongexternal disk/strong and tried to boot my mac from that disk. Everything fine.  Now whenever I boot my Mac normally (without even having the disk connected) strongit gets stuck at the grey screen before the Apple logo/strong for a lot of time, like 5â€“6 seconds, something that never happened before.  It looks like it is spending time deciding which disk to boot, even though there is only the Macintosh HD. Is there a way to fix this?  <answer294293> I found the issue, on strongGeneral  Startup Disk/strong it automatically selected the external drive. Switched back to Machintosh HD and it worked.
