OS X VPN + 2FA? <body> Alright.. so I have a 10.6 Server but I don't want this question to be restricted to that older version of Server - if this can be done with a newer version then I'm all ears.  Is there a 2FA implementation that can be used with OS X's built-in VPN server?  I once got Duo Security working (through a PAM plugin) and used it to add a layer of security to SSH on a Debian VPS .. it worked really well.  I'm wondering if a similar thing could be done with OS X's VPN.
