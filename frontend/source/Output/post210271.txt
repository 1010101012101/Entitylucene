Switch keyboard from terminal? <body> Is there a command line equivalent to pressing ctrl-space to toggle the keyboard layout? (I need this because I want to use Karabiner to tap shift to toggle.)  <answer210277> Make an applescript:  codetell application "System Events"     keystroke " " using control down end tell/code  PS. This is too slow, and allows more keys from the old keyboard to be entered before the switch is effectual.
