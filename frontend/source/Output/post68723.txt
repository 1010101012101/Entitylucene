Xserver crashing, logs are incomplete as to why <body> We are currently running an OS X Server, and for the past month or two, it has been crashing around the same times. There is no rhyme or reason as to why, and the logs do not tell a full picture as to why.  I am assuming it is either a cron job that is running or something that is scheduled, and it is accessing something that is corrupt or something that is wearing down.  Has anybody else run into this, or some possible guidance as far as where to look?  Thanks!  Edit: This is a screen shot of the console "All Messages" option, as I couldn't find any definitive logs that would give me any clarity. We recorded the crash at around 11:43-11:44 Today. So it can be any day, but normally between 9:30 and 12:00. I don't know if it is someone accessing a corrupt file on the server or not.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iaiLk.jpg" alt="Server Screen Shot"  <comment79838> Could you post the relevant bits from the log? <comment79841> The only ones we can find are after the fact. Like for example in AFP after we restart the server, or in the Directory Services log which only shows when the system actually reboots: 2012-10-17 10:42:49 EDT - T[0x00007FFF70074CC0] - Improper shutdown detected  There is nothing in the crash reporter or the hang report. <comment79843> What about the bit about a "sleep signal"? I'd add the exact except to your question, as it might be helpful. <comment300321> The logs don't show anything special. Try a sysdiagnose and send it over to people here in private if you don't want the contents shared. You can generate one locally using a keyboard: Control-Option-Command-Shift-Period or if you don't have local access, over SSH or via VNC+Terminal, you can execute the command directly: https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sysdiagnose.1.html
