Write write to /usr/lib on macOS Sierra <body> I'm on macOS Sierra 10.12.5, and trying to add a library to the codeusr/lib/code folder (for an OpenFrameworks project I'm working on).  I've seen similar questions here, here, and here.  However, none of the suggested answers seem to have any effect. On Sierra, it seems that when rebooting in recovery mode, there is no longer any way to access a Terminal window (unless I'm mistaken), so System Integrity Protection can't be disabled by running codecsrutil disable/code.   Does anyone have any suggestions?   <comment359828> The Terminal.app is available is recovery mode and so is`csrutil` . <comment359841> @fd0 I wasn't able to see it when I rebooted in recovery mode - how do you get to it? <comment359843> In the `Utilites` menu at the top of the screen. <comment359845> Instead of installing in `/usr/lib` use `/usr/local/lib` which doesn't require to disable SIP
