Possible to disable custom Javascript keybindings in Safari? <body> I have a couple of decades experience using Emacs, so the Emacs-like keybindings for text editing on Mac OS X are very nice.  Unfortunately, some websites (ahem) choose to override these with Javascript.  For example, one of them makes kbdcontrol/kbdkbdB/kbd insert the text code**strong text**/code, rather than going back one character.  Is there any way to make Safari ignore Javascript keybindings that try to remap the standard OS X keybindings?  <answer90287> It's been a while since I've used it, but the Privoxy proxy server has the feature to modify javascript to change behavior. If you're willing to run a proxy server, that is an option.   I did look (though not exhaustively), and didn't see a browser plugin that rewrote content (xml, html, CSS, or javascript) like privoxy does. In Privoxy's web page, look for the js-annoyances filter. That is where you'll find examples of rewriting javascript.  Perhaps there's a more modern implementation in the form of a browser plugin that provides a similar feature, but privoxy used to work fine for this use case.  <answer90505> Here is Rob W's script from meta, updated to only block cntrl-* and fixed so that it works with NinjaKit which is a safari extension for running user scripts.

See [Is there a way to disable the hotkeys? - Meta Stack Overflow](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2980/is-there-a-way-to-disable-the-hotkeys?lq=1). <comment69758> Thanks for the link!  It's frustrating to see that they think it's fine just because people didn't complain enough.  (I've been using SE sites for years and I didn't realize I needed to start complaining on day 1 for my voice to be heard.)  I'm hesitant to add any web browser extensions, though, since the first part of any web browser issue diagnosis is "disable all extensions". <comment70617> I'm with Ken. I personally can't count how many times I've had to use "undo" because my hands forgot I was on an SE site :S <comment85556> I was going to suggest that you could disable javascript... It fixed your problem, but it created a new one â€” I could no longer post comments on StackExchange... =P <comment105815> Is this question about the site here? or about disabling javascript everywhere? I could move it to our meta as a bug report, but there's already several requests for this site wide. http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3245/option-to-disable-keyboard-shortcuts-in-wmd <comment105861> It's been a while since I've used it, but the Privoxy proxy server (http://www.privoxy.org/) has the feature to modify javascript to change behavior.

We're going on almost a year without a single answer, so even a partial one would help. <comment106294> [More info...](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2980/is-there-a-way-to-disable-the-hotkeys) <comment354147> [This script as a chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-stackexchange-editor-k/nhdklhaffdlobbdgheaehofbnfebeddm?hl=en-US)
