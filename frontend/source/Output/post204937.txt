How to access photos on disk image from "Photos" <body> With the iPhotos app on my Mac Mini I was able to access a specially created disk image for all my photos.  I have upgraded to Yosemite and now iPhotos reports it is no longer valid and I must use Photos.  The issue is that Photos refuses to import.  How can I access the content of my disk image from Photos? If I choose to "Show Package Contents" on the image I can browse through the "Masters" folder so I see everything is fine.  As well, "Verify Disk" reports everything is fine.  I did try to follow the instructions here How to migrate from iPhoto to Photos but it just reports that the library could not be opened.  Mac newbie here so any directions are helpful.  <comment247122> Why do you have it in a disk image? <comment247145> My guess is it's not a .dmg file, it's a Library package file - judging by "Show Package Contents".  What error message are you getting, & at what point in the import?
