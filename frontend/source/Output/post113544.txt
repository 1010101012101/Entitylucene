Unable to enable AVB under Mavericks on MacBook Pro <body> I have a MacBook Pro that has the Thunderbolt hardware which means it should be able to support EthernetAVB. I have done a search and found the command to enable it at the website Manual Pagez. The command it outlines is avbdeviced and then I place --list-interfaces after it to have it list the devices that can work with EthernetAVB.  When I run the command in terminal (either as sudo or just plain) even after going up to root I receive a response like this  precodeBradfordBenns-MacBook-Pro:/ bradfordbenn$ avbdeviced --list-interface -bash: avbdeviced: command not found BradfordBenns-MacBook-Pro:/ bradfordbenn$ sudo avbdeviced --list-interface Password: sudo: avbdeviced: command not found /code/pre  I believe that the system has everything installed as I have a directory called Macintosh HD:Library:Audio:Plug-Ins:HAL:AppleAVBAudio.driver:Contents:MacOS:AppleAVBAudio  Is there a step I am missing or how do I enable the AVB feature?  The more formal information about the system:     System Version:   OS X 10.9 (13A603)br   Kernel Version:   Darwin 13.0.0   Boot Volume:  Macintosh HD   Boot   Mode: Normal   <answer113614> AVB no longer needs to be enabled under OS X 10.9. avbdeviced has been removed.  You should be able to view and connect devices via 'Window' - 'Network Device Browser' in Audio MIDI Setup.  <comment133353> Thanks I will verify that once I get back to the system.
