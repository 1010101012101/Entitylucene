How created watched folder with Automator to auto import new files into itunes? <body> I was wondering if someone could help me with this. This what I'd like to do:  File is downloaded into Folder A, it is automatically imported into itunes and then moved to folder B. This happens automatically anytime a new file appears, I don't have to trigger a script, etc..   Can this be done with automator?   I've tried by making a workflow:br Finder Finder Itemsbr Import Files into Itunes (but it won't import movie files, only audio)  If anyone can help or knows of a little app that do this please let me know! Thanks!  <answer81710> In Automator, choose the Folder Action Template  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HVKZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer84604> You can do it better by placing files to the folder code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Automatically Add to iTunes/code in Finder (or code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Automatically Add to iTunes.localized/code in Terminal.app) to be automatically added to iTunes without any third party program  <comment105937> Note that the location depends on locale.  In Danish the folder is `$HOME/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/FÃ¸j automatisk til iTunes` <comment105946> This is nice. Never knew this folder existed. Just a note if you have moved your music library from the default location. The Automatically Add to iTunes needs to be the one inside the relocated Music folder. And not the default.
