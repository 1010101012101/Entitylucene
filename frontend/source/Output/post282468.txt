How do I change iPhone language to Lithuanian? <body> I was asked to translate my iOS app to Lithuanian language. I did it, but now I would like to see the result, and...  cannot change language of my iPhone to Lithuanian. Why?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1PC7l.png" alt="enter image description here"  There is no such lanaguage on my list, and I am confused.  <answer282471> Settings  general  language and region.  Use Edit button to move Lithuanian to the top of the Preferred Languages list.  If not there, use the add language button at bottom.  <answer282472> My understanding is that Lithuanian is not one of the 31 languages supported natively by iOS. However, since iOS 8, iOS apps can be in strongany/strong language, even if Apple hasn't localised it yet.   In iOS 8 and above you can do this as follows:  ul liGo to Settings/li liTap on General/li liTap on Language &amp; Region/li liNear the top, tap on the blue emOther languages.../em option/li liIn the search field just enter 'lit' to filter the list down to Lithuanian/li liSelect the language/li /ul  You may also find these links useful with what you're doing:  ul liiOS Supported Language Codes (ISO-639)/li liBuild Apps for the World/li /ul  <comment355829> I know. There is no lithuanian language... <comment355832> Sorry, forgot, no iOS Lithuanian .  You have to put this at top of the preferred language list.
