How to prevent annoying Preview in El Capitan from showing thumbnails? <body> I never used thumbnails when opening PDFs, but El Capitan decided I have to see them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOgEe.png" alt="enter image description here"  And there is no option to disable permanently. If I reopen a document where I disabled them, most of the times they just show up again. Is there anything I can do?  <comment258213> This related question/answer seems to fix this problem: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/213395/9190 <comment258238> Thanks that fixed it!!! I cannot believe they chose to force us to use thumbnails with no option to take them away.
