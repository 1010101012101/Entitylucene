Font Installs, But Not in FontBook <body> I've tried to install two TTF fonts, but they don't show up in FontBook.  Message in Console is:  codeSandbox: FontValidator(897) deny(1) file-read-metadata //code  <answer253629> The files were already present in code~/Library/Fonts/code but they had different permissions than the other files. By changing permissions -- using codesudo chmod 755 blah.ttf/code -- and then running FontBook, everything worked.
