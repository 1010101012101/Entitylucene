Can I install apps on Lion without using app store? <body> Is it true that I can only install app from app store in OS X Lion?   Can I not install app from any other source?  <answer15488> No, it's not true. Without breaking the NDA I can say, that many developers made their software Lion compatible and distribute it from their sites.  <answer15504> Not true - mean sure can install apps from dmg.  The Lion remain a full-blown OS, with all common functions, like Terminal.app, root access, Developer system, and so on. When here is strongno way/strong block installing applications if you will have a root access, so Apple sure will NOT TRY do this.  The following is only my opinion:  On the other side - most of developers will sell their apps via AppStore (because it is easy), so here will be less "demo downloads" (what was possible activated by simple serial#). IMHO, over the time will be here more and more application in AppStore in two versions, like for example:  ul liSudokuLite.app (like current demo versions) - free,/li liSudoku.app (full paid version)/li /ul  <comment16813> Unless this has been specifically answered by Apple in a public forum, I'd imagine anyone who knows the answer to this is under NDA and thus won't be able to talk about it here. <comment16842> Despite being a good question - this is speculation about a pre-announced software. <comment16883> There may be NDAs but they are leaky.  Cocoasodt, for example, just pointed out that the next release of PathFinder -  NOT in the app store - works fine on Lion. I don't think its speculative at all to talk about that. <comment16914> Answers are getting upvotes but this  question gets downvote? Is this really such bad question that downvote is necessary? Strange...
