How can I resolve this error during a dmg copy operation <body> I am trying to copy a 200GB dmg file between two disks (one firewire, one local) and see this error:  precodeThe Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in “mbp_18_06_2011.dmg” can’t be read or written. (Error code -36) /code/pre  How can I debug / fix?  <answer124295> You can try copying the data using Terminal   Type in sudo ditto ~/sourcefile ~/Destination  Replace "~/sourcefile" by dragging the file you want to copy into the terminal window which will autofill, and do the same with the "~/destination"  Alternatively: sudo ditto -V ~/sourcefile ~/Desktop This will show you progress and any errors as the files are being copied       img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lCbwZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer161611> If the dmg is mounted, you'll get that error when trying to copy it I believe. Eject/unmount the dmg file first and try to copy it.   <comment145374> thanks. would the -nocache option prevent any temporary copies being created? The operation failed with a similar error. BTW, its just one file, ~200GB <comment145384> ditto: /Volumes/Backups2011/Old MPB/./mbp_18_06_2011.dmg: Input/output error <comment147710> Hello, sorry for the late reply. I/O errors means the hard drive has bad sectors hence the reason why you can't successfully copy the data across.
