WiFi problems on Yosemite <body> I've seen a few posts around wifi problems with Yosemite, especially after an update from Mavericks. I've only started seeing WiFi problems about 3 days ago (update was 3-6 months ago), and my issues are happening on a number of routers.  Looking on the console, I see a number of the following messages:  precode&gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:03.691 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform. &gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:04.443 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform. &gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:07.277 com.apple.WebKit.WebContent[2260]: dnssd_clientstub write_all(16) failed -1/64 32 Broken pipe &gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:07.277 com.apple.WebKit.WebContent[2260]: dnssd_clientstub write_all(16) failed -1/28 32 Broken pipe &gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:19.113 discoveryd[2360]: Basic DNSResolver UDNS Send(): UDP Sendto() failed to DNSNameServer 8.8.8.8 Port 53 errno 65, fd 53, ErrLogCount 1 ResolverIntf:0 &gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:19.114 discoveryd[2360]: Basic DNSResolver UDNS Send(): UDP Sendto() failed to DNSNameServer 8.8.8.8 Port 53 errno 65, fd 51, ErrLogCount 2 ResolverIntf:0 &gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:19.477 discoveryd[2360]: Basic DNSResolver UDNS Send(): UDP Sendto() failed to DNSNameServer 8.8.4.4 Port 53 errno 65, fd 52, ErrLogCount 3 ResolverIntf:0 &gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:20.177 discoveryd[2360]: Basic DNSResolver UDNS Send(): UDP Sendto() failed to DNSNameServer 8.8.4.4 Port 53 errno 65, fd 37, ErrLogCount 4 ResolverIntf:0 &gt; 06/06/2015 17:07:20.178 discoveryd[2360]: Basic DNSResolver UDNS Send(): UDP Sendto() failed to DNSNameServer 8.8.4.4 Port 53 errno 65, fd 37, ErrLogCount 5 ResolverIntf:0 /code/pre  WiFi otherwise "appears" normal (wifi symbol in the status bar shows no error, and network config says I'm still connected); however, no connectivity (not even through codeping/code).   I can at this point disconnect and reconnect to the wifi, which will work for about 1 minute before disconnecting again.   Only long-term solution is to reboot. Unsure what triggers it!  I've tried, but no luck with, - restart codediscoveryd/code - clear safari cache - change dns servers  Help would be appreciated - I'd rather avoid having to fresh-install the OS!  <answer190366> The latest OS X 10.10.4 public beta, build 14E26a, totally gets rid of discoveryd. Go to this Apple link and sign up for the public beta program, where you'll be given a link to download a piece of software that'll get the App Store to pick up beta updates. Take a backup of everything, install Beta Access Utility, and then install and enjoy a discoveryd-free Yosemite!  <answer190369> Since your problem is recent it might not be Yosemite related but Apple has acknowledged the serious problems with the DNS using the discoveryd.  From the log it shows having problems with your DNS setting.  You use the Google public which should be fine but:  ul liTry changing it to 8.8.4.4 (and delete all other entries)/li liOr even better:/li /ul  Get this smart app and it will analyze and recommend to you the best and the fastest DNS in your location.  It is called "namebench".  ul liIf you want more Surgical approach (without 10.10.4 (beta)/li /ul  Restoring mDNSResponder, if you dare     First a word of warning: if something goes wrong, your Mac may not be   able to boot. This can be fixed by booting in single user mode and   re-enabling discoveryd (see below). Be sure you have a recent backup   just in case, and only follow the steps below if you are prepared to   boot into single user mode if needed.      The first thing you need to do is find copies of 10.9 mDNSResponder,   mDNSResponderHelper, and their plist files. On a 10.9 system, they're   found in /usr/sbin/ and /System/Library/LaunchDaemons,   respectively.......   Disclaimer: I have not tested it since I am still on Mavericks.  <comment226001> Sure -- I've tried chaining the DNS config around, without much luck. Will try restoring the mDNS. Thanks!
