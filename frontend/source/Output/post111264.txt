How to recover missing notes since Mavericks update? <body> Very recently I've updated my computer via the Mac App Store to Mavericks. Today when I opened Notes I noticed the background had changed but even more startling was that all my notes were stronggone/strong! It shows "error 43".  I have an external hard drive and backed up my computer.   Is there any way to get my notes back?  <answer111288> This should fix the problem:br strongNote: If you do not have an Apple ID, that means your Notes are completely lost./strong  ol liGo to Finder./li liClick on Applications./li liFind System Preferences./li liClick on iCloud./li liLog in to your iCloud account if you have not logged in yet./li liSelect the Notes checkbox./li /ol  <answer117145> The notes should be stored in your backup, at least. Check here  Solution is to navigate to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes and restore:  NotesV1.storedatabr NotesV1.storedata-shmbr NotesV1.storedata-wal    Where ~ is your home directory e.g. /Users/your_username  Refer macrumors or apple discussions for more info.  <comment130941> You should expand your question, to include the text of the error message.  Where did the error come up? Also what do you mean updated?  Did you purchase Mac OS X 10.9 and update? Or did you just update an app?  Other than that, if you were using, TimeMachine for backups you should be able to recover your notes. <comment136909> This did not locate my notes. Could it be that only notes that were saved on the cloud are recoverable? Very disappointing any other ideas?
