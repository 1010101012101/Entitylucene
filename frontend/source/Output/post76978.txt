How to stop Mountain Lion to stop shutting down and closing all my applications? <body> I tried to look up related problems with this, but I haven't been able to find a solution. After leaving my computer on, charged, and step away, sometimes it logs my account off. When I come back, log on, all my applications have been turned off. I have adjusted the settings under "Energy Saver" and allow the computer a longer sleep time, but that doesn't seem to work.   OS X Version 10.8.2 Any suggestions?  <answer82719> When you say it "logs your account off" do you mean that you have to enter your password?  My guess is that someone has set Security &amp; Privacy settings to require a login password after sleep or screen saver begins. Go to Apple menu  System Preferences, click Security &amp; Privacy, and then click General to see.  <answer105153> ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong./li liUnlock the preference pane./li liClick strongAdvanced/strong./li liUncheck the strongLog out after em?/em minutes of inactivity/strong or change the time./li /ol  <comment89348> What model / how old is your Mac? <comment95372> Mountain Lion has some new auto-terminate function for apps, which COULD explain that part.
