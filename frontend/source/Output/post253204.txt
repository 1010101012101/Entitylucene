Charger will only charge for a few seconds before needing replugging <body> I use a clone charger wire for the iPhone. It looks very similar to an OEM version but is slightly different.  When I first started using it, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the metal connection end was a bit angled (when viewed sideways). I applied pressure to make the metal bit stick straight out.  First of all, I feel kinda stupid since it worked fine even though it was bent.  Now the thing only charges my phone for a few seconds before:  ol liiPhone says this accesory may not be supported/li liiPhone acts as if I just pulled the charger from the port and stops charging/li /ol  All while it's still plugged in and supposed to be charging.  What is wrong with the cable?  strongEdit:/strong I accidentally dropped my iPhone while plugged in. The metal bit just bent like 30 degrees. I carefully bent it back into place.  <answer277931> strongMore than likely, you broke the lightning connector solder points on its PCB/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/enCVL.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you dropped your iPhone and bent your connector, you weakened the solder joints.  When you bent it back, it probably broke the joint enough where is makes a very poor connection to no connection at all.  It's time for a new cable.  <comment315083> What is wrong with the cable? I'd venture that paragraphs 2 and 8 should answer that question for you. Hopefully you haven't damaged the phone itself. <comment315084> Charging, bent leads, plugging and unplugging.. You need to get a new wire and hope at this point, that is the only thing wrong. <comment315185> @tubedogg the phone itself is fine. <comment315186> @norcal i proably will. how are the 3rd party wires in comparison to OEM? <comment315187> If you get one that's MFi (Made For iPhone/iPod/iPad) certified it should be fine. Beyond that you're on your own. <comment315189> @tubedogg thanks <comment315191> I was about to reply with what @tubedogg basically said. Cheers
