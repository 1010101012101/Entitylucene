How to launch Gnumeric after installing using Homebrew <body> I've installed Gnumeric using Homebrew. I first manually installed XQuartz (as required) and then ran codebrew install gnumeric/code. Everything seems to have installed fine.  Now how do I launch it?  When I run code/usr/local/bin/gnumeric/code I see:  precodeCannot open display: Run '/usr/local/bin/gnumeric --help' to see a full list of available command line options. /code/pre  This is the result of code/usr/local/bin/gnumeric --help/code:  precodeUsage:     /usr/local/bin/gnumeric [OPTION...] [FILE ...]  Help Options:     -h, --help                                Show help options     --help-all                                Show all help options     --help-libspreadsheet                     Show Gnumeric Options     --help-gtk                                Show GTK+ Options  Application Options:     -g, --geometry=WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF     Specify the size and location of the initial window     --no-splash                               Don't show splash screen     --no-warnings                             Don't display warning dialogs when importing     --display=DISPLAY                         X display to use /code/pre  <comment167836> Have you tried launching it from an xterm? <comment167839> @Édouard Got it! I didn't know I had to launch it using X11. Thanks. If you post an answer, I will accept. <comment167843> Without doubt, you will detail the steps you took with more accuracy than I could. I’ll let you post your own, and flag these comments as obsolete.
