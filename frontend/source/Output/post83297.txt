Removed Movies folder, now want it back <body> That's it. I typed coderm -r ~/Movies/code in the Terminal and entered the root password. Now I want to get this nice-looking Movies folder with a corresponding icon back to my home folder.   Folder was completely empty, so there is no need for data recovery, I just want to recreate the original Movies folder.  Thanks in advance!   strongUPD/strong: I've tried codemkdir ~/Movies/code but it creates a regular folder.  <answer83341> AFAIK, OS X doesn't treat 'special' folders like ~/Movies any more special than others - it just doesn't let you delete them via the Finder.  I could upload the Movies folder ICNS file, but if I did, you wouldn't get proper icons for different sizes (see screenshot.) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zEai0.png" alt="In case you can&#39;t see this image, the real Movies folder has a proper border for smaller icons, however the unoriginal one doesn&#39;t."  I guess a method would be to create a new user account, get the Movies folder from emthat/em and then copy it to your Home folder.  <comment95912> Is `mkdir ~/Movies` not enough? <comment95916> @patrix Sorry, I should mention that. I tried `mkdir ~/Movies` but resulting folder looks just like any regular folder, and I'm afraid that OS X will not treat it as the special folder. <comment95917> So you are missing the icon then? Don't think there is very much else which is different as such. <comment95919> @patrix I'm not only missing the icon, but I'm also afraid that OS X might treat the original Music folder in a special way.
