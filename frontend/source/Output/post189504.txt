How to Recover a gone OSX (mavericks) on MacBookPro? <body> I shutdown my computer for some reasons with power button (cold shutdown). Unfortunately, my OS i.e.,codemavericks/codeis gone at the moment and I have no backup from the Data and settings of that Hard drive partition.br   I have the mavericks installation DVD, and tried to repair the disk with codeDisk Utility/code but it didn't work. getting the following message:       Disk utility stopped repairing 'Macintosh HD`, Disk utility cant   repair the disk, back up as many of your files.....'   I have 2 partitions on my hard drive including codeMacintosh HD/code which my OS was installed there, and codeMac Store/code that contains my own data.br I tried to reinstall and recover the OS on the same drive i.e,codeMacintosh HD/code in order to keep the settings (password, usernames,) and information of my hard drive (However,later I should do the clean install).   To do this, I selected the codeMacintosh HD/code disk, and clicked on install , but I am getting an error saying      The content of disk can't be changed. OSX couldn't be installed on   this disk.   So I wanted to ask  strong1./strong Is there anyway to get my previous OS to work (I need my passwords and Data in Desktop,documents and download folders)?    strong2./strong Even if 1 is not possible, how can I backup the Data of that partition i.e,codeMacintosh HD/code?    strong3./strong Is it possible to extract my saved passwords on Firefox as well?    Thanks for your help.  <answer189710> Problem has been solved, Just thought it may be useful for others.    em1. Is there anyway to get my previous OS to work (I need my passwords and Data in Desktop,documents and download folders)?/em        Maybe, But I don't know yet. But anyway, it is better to clean install   the OS again to make your computer faster.   em2. Even if 1 is not possible, how can I backup the Data of that partition i.e,Macintosh HD?/em      Yes, basically I installed mavericks on a USB thumb drive. Next I log   in my new OS and copied everything I needed to a external Hard drive.   Then I formatted the whole MAC HDD and then clean installed the OS   there. Now it is working well.   em3. Is it possible to extract my saved passwords on Firefox as well?/em      Yes, Once I installed the Mavericks on a thumb drive, I went to user   folder, library/application support and then found Firefox folder and   copied my profile . After I inistalled the OS on MAC HDD, I installed   firefox and then pasted that profile in the same place. All of my   passwords and bookmarks are there.   <comment224759> You really should have stopped at the first error. Remove the drive, put it in a USB enclosure. Install a new drive to the Macbook. Set up fresh install, add recovery tools, plug in the old drive - **then** you're in a position to start trying to rescue the old drive, without making things worse. <comment224760> is there any way to use a USB portable OS and boot from that to back up my hard drive?  @Tetsujin <comment224762> You'll need a second drive to recover to anyway, so you gain nothing by booting from USB. You need to avoid any process that will try to write to the damaged drive. <comment224763> I have an External USB hard drive which is half empty. does it work? @Tetsujin <comment224764> If you can boot to a full OS & recovery tools. You'd still be safer with the damaged drive out of the machine until you're ready to examine it. <comment224766> please suggest easier ways, I don't want to remove it from laptop. I had same issue 2 years ago. But at that time my data was not so important , so I formatted the disk and clean installed the OS. it would be great if I could attach my USB external drive and backup my HD with a virtual OS @Tetsujin <comment224767> You've already hammered at the drive far too much for a simple fix. It's your choice now, depending on how valuable your data is. Try installing an OS & recovery tools on the external, but stop trying to write to the internal until you can access it safely
