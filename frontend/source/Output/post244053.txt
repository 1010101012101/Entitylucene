What would be the repercussions about lying about age in apple developer program? <body> I cannot enroll in the Apple Developer program because I am under 18. What would be the repercussions if I lied about my age and then signed up?  <answer244082> If you just want to create apps, you can download emXcode/em and do that for free. You can even deploy the apps to your own devices.   If you want to sell apps on the emApp Store/em, it takes more than just signing-up for the Dev Program; you have to sign contracts and bank agreements. You could be susceptible to charges of fraud and/or misrepresentation.   <comment300707> Just use a parent's name and birthday until you're old enough to enroll yourself.
