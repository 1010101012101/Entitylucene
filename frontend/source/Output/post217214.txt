How can I get Safari to set kMDItemWhereFroms when using "Save Image to Downloads"? <body> Specifically in Safari 9.0: when I save an image via right clicking and selecting emSave image as.../em I can specify the downloads folder and the kMDItemWhereFrom data is saved just fine, as revealed both by selecting the file in Finder and using kbdcmd/kbdkbdI/kbd and also via Terminal using codemdls/code.  However, when I save an image via right clicking emSave Image to "Downloads"/em the kMDItemWhereFrom data emisn't/em saved. This occurs even when selecting exactly the same image. I'm pretty sure it did work back in previous versions of Safari, as I have older images saved that have this data.  I can't find any documentation referring to this change. Is there a way to restore the functionality? It was far more convenient before.  <comment263634> This seems like a good opportunity [to file a bug with Apple](https://bugreport.apple.com). <comment263648> @patrix Same issue occurs with OSX 10.8/Safari 6.0. Perhaps I am mistaken and it's *never* been saved with *Save Image to "Downloads"*, or else a change occurred prior to Safari 6. Looking at my older images, it looks like the 'where from' data was dropped from them around January 2012, which suggests Safari 5.
