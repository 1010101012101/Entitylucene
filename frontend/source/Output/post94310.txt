How to keep PS1 changed in terminal? <body> I'm able to change the terminal prefix with codePS1="[\\W]$"/code.  However, whenever I restart the terminal or open a new instance, it reverts to the default.  How can I make this change permanent?  Thanks!  hr  Here's the content of code~/.profile/code file:  precodePS1="[\\W]\\$" /code/pre  <answer94317> If both .bash_profile and .profile exist, bash reads only .bash_profile when opening a login shell. So try adding the line to .bash_profile instead.  <answer223107> Most Bash shell customizations, including the codePS1/code shell prompt, should be set in code~/.bashrc/code, which applies to all interactive shells.  You'll also need a code~/.bash_profile/code—which should only contain items for login shells—and it should source code~/.bashrc/code, e.g.,  precode[ -r ~/.bashrc] &amp;&amp; . ~/.bashrc /code/pre  If you have a code~/.profile/code it should only contain POSIX-compatible commands and nothing Bash-specific, which means you should prefer to use code~/.bash_profile/code for login commands when you have a code~/.bashrc/code for it to source.  <comment110561> try `echo 'PS1="[\\W]$"'  $HOME/.profile` <comment110562> Nope, that doesn't work. <comment110563> @downvotes - what's wrong with the question? <comment110564> thats works. Simply you need add it into the `.profile` file. <comment110566> Thanks for messages jm666 but it seems to be there already. I just updated the question with contents of my `.profile` file. <comment110567> what shell do you uses? `echo $SHELL` or `echo $0` on terminal should tell it. Btw, do you opened an new terminal window? <comment110568> Here's the output: `echo $SHELL = /bin/bash` and `echo $0 = --bash`. Also I restarted the terminal after entering the command from your first comment. <comment110631> That did the trick - thanks a lot Lauri! <comment173377> https://gist.github.com/dcondrey/f1187c2f7f51ed8daf85 <comment270439> Don't just jam things in .bash_profile. Things you want to apply to all interactive shells should go in ~/.bashrc. Only things you want in login shells should go in ~/.bash_profile. ~/.bash_profile should source ~/.bashrc to pick up the stuff you want in all interactive shells. <comment270443> In particular, login shells can be non-interactive, so avoid doing interactive-shell setup in `~/.bash_profile` or the other profile/login scripts. <comment332639> Note that `~/.profile` is the POSIX shell login file and should only contain POSIX-compatible shell commands. It should not contain Bash-specific commands like setting `PS1`. Bash-specific login-shell commands should be placed in the Bash-specific `~/.bash_profile`.
