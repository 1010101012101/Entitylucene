iPhone 6s Authentication Required error will not go away <body> I recently updated my phone to version 10.1.1, and ever since I have gotten the attached error.  i enter my iTunes username and password and I still get the error.  I have tried restarting the phone as well.  How do i make this go away?

I don't recall 'password will be sent in the clear' or a full url (iosapps?) being displayed.  Maybe I've just never seen it but it looks odd.  Could it be similar to [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/179788/88313)?
