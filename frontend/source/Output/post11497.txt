Can I take a still photo with my built-in webcam? <body> I have a MacBook Pro at work, but am new to Macs and have never used the webcam outside of Skype. Is it possible to take a still photo with the webcam?  <answer11498> Yes, use the Photo Booth application.  <answer11499> You can with PhotoBooth. You can also use all kinds of crazy effects. I suggest trying this when you don't have any important appointments later. :)  <answer11500> Check out /Applications/Photo Booth.app
