Is it possible to enable OSX keyboard text substitution in more apps? <body> OSX has built into text substitution that is configured in System Preferences  Keyboard  Text. This works great in certain apps, such as Evernote and Textedit, but seems to be disabled in other apps/content areas. Is it possible to enable it in other apps, such as Google Chrome?  I would like to use text substitution to drop in signatures when composing emails at gmail.com while using Google Chrome.  <answer217387> The application needs to implement emAuto Text Expansion/em and it hasn't been implemented in Chrome yet. You could try this Chrome plugin Auto Text Expander. You'll have to again add the text-expansions though.  Mac's Text expansion should work in Safari though. If not already enabled, you can enable by typing the following in terminal.  codedefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true/code  <answer219993> I have found this to be problematic, too.  It is the one thing that nudges me back to using Safari instead of Chrome for OSX.  The solution that I've decided to use - at least for now - is to purchase TextExpander, which is a system-wide text shortcut solution.    While it does have significant advantages over the native text shortcuts there are some drawbacks as well.  For example, if I decide to delete the shortcuts in the System Preferences pane in order to avoid conflicts it will also delete them on my iOS devices, which is an undesirable effect for me.    Perhaps @sdayal can tell me if his tip about enabling the text expansion will work in reverse and, in fact, if it is also available for other applications.  For example, could I use the following terminal command:  precodedefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool false /code/pre  to disable the text shortcuts in Safari?  Moreover, are the equivalent commands for other apps, such as Mail, that I could use?  For example, would it be appropriate to use:  precodedefaults write -g MailAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool false /code/pre  Thank you in advance for any assistance.  Turning strongoff/strong these shortcuts has been a vexing problem for me.    <comment262803> The Auto Text Expander Chrome extension solves my immediate need. Thanks! <comment266191> You better off using a third party apps, my preference TextExpander; very well made.
