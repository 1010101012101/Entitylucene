External Monitor not working on MacBook Pro 2015 with HDMI-VGA converter <body> I have an HDMI to VGA connector and a Samsung LED screen. The screen is fine, the VGA cable is fine, the connector is fine (tried with different laptops running Ubuntu and Windows).   strongThe Problem/strong:  I'm plugging the HDMI-VGA connector in my Macbook Pro 2015 but the display doesn't show on the external screen.   What I've tried: I went in Displays and tried all given options like extend screen and more. The window also shows the name of the screen "SMB2230" on my Macbook and when I plug-in the HDMI, the screen flickers for a second and dock (on the right) disappears from the built-in display and I can move my mouse to the right and it also disappears but the external monitor shows the message "Check signal cable". I have tried restarting it as well but no luck.   strongNote/strong: The screen is working with other laptops running Windows and Ubuntu with the same connector and the same VGA cable.   emPlease don't tell me that I have to use MiniDisplay port/wire from Apple./em   here is an image img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d52sW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer229389> Try a PRAM and SMC reset. Usually helps.  Also try replugging in the connectors on both ends   <answer236315> Look at my answer on this forum, hope it will work for you! https://discussions.apple.com/message/30126959#30126959  <comment279831> Have you tried restarting the machine? <comment279836> @ComputerScienceStudent yes but no luck, forgot to mention it in the question. <comment279848> Thanks for the answer, tried it but still no luck. <comment279895> Could be a driver problem
