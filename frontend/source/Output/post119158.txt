Can I restore lost photos fron backup? <body> I have an iPhone 4,16G.   I had a ringtone issue and Apple support did a software reboot.   Before starting, a phone backup was done. All apps are back as well as phone contacts. However, all my photos are missing.   Can these be restored?   <answer119173> Photos and Videos in the camera roll (not photo stream) are indeed in the backup file. I would copy the backup file to a second location so that you can have a backup of it. There are also tools that allow you to examine the contents of a iPhone backup. http://addpod.com/juicephone  Try juicephone first and if need be you can restore your phone to the backup temporarily.  <comment138984> Did you restore the backup after doing the software reboot?
