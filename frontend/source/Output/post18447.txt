How can I delete "Passenger" from my "System Preference"? <body> About 2 years ago I tried and installed Phusion Passenger Preference Pane for OS X and now I need to delete its "Passenger" icon from my System Preference. There's no uninstall option, how can I delete it?  I use Mac OS X 10.5.8  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/81zjd.png" alt="My System Preference"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rVqur.png" alt="Passenger"  <answer18449> Just right click the icon and select remove. (it will be moved to trash which you can empty to get rid of it completely)  <comment20164> Oh, wow!! Wonderful! It's working! Thanks Jonathan. Really appreciate it. This very simple solution made me feel stupid for not trying to right click it :-)) d'oh! <comment20169> No problem took me a while to find it myself originally.
