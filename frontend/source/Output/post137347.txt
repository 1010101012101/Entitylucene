pfctl rules to only allow OpenVPN connection? <body> I'm trying to lock down my internet connection for privacy reasons and have signed up with a VPN provider who does no filtering (quite opposite to my ISP). The VPN provider supports OpenVPN via UDP on port 7001 to openvpn.vpnprovider.com, creating a codetun0/code interface with a dynamic, public IP.  So far I have used an codeipfw/code ruleset with Waterroof but I need to add to it every time I connect from a new LAN (ie. at home it's 10.3.2.em, at work 192.168.60./em, from my favorite cafe it's 192.168.1.* and so on).  Is there a more generic, more modern (in Apple/BSD's way of thinking codeipfw/code is apparently deprecated) ruleset for codepfctl/codewhichbr a) allows my 10.9 Mac to only connect to codeopenvpn.vpnprovider.com:7001/code codeUDP/code from any source/local IP (eg. regardless of what my current local IP is so I don't have to touch the ruleset every time I encounter/use a new LAN),br b) blocks all other traffic except the current local traffic (ie. everything within the local code/24/code is ok to be transmitted and received, for example to access my printer at home or the NAS in the office) on all physical interfaces in and out, c) allows all internet traffic through codetun0/code andbr d) allows DNS through Google's DNS servers?  Here's my current ruleset which, for unknown reasons, sometimes makes me having to try to connect multiple times until an OpenVPN connection is established:    precodeadd 01000 allow ip from me to 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 dst-port 53 keep-state add 01500 allow udp from any 67,68 to any dst-port 67,68 add 02000 allow ip from me to me via lo* add 03000 allow ip from 192.168.60.0/24 to any dst-port 7001-7004,1194 keep-state add 04000 allow ip from 192.168.1.0/24 to any dst-port 7001-7004,1194 keep-state add 05000 allow ip from 10.3.2.0/24 to any dst-port 7001-7004,1194 keep-state add 06000 allow ip from me to 192.168.60.0/24 add 07000 allow ip from 192.168.60.0/24 to me add 08000 allow ip from 192.168.1.0/24 to me add 09000 allow ip from me to 10.3.2.0/24 add 10000 allow ip from 10.3.2.0/24 to me add 12000 allow ip from any to any via tun0 keep-state add 13000 deny log ip from any to any add 65535 allow ip from any to any /code/pre
