Is there a way to get a list of all currently running program's window titles with AppleScript? <body> I'm looking to write a script which outputs a list of all the window titles of all the currently running programs. Is there any way to do this with AppleScript? I tried running the following code:  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat with theProcess in (every process)         if background only of theProcess is false then             say (name of theProcess) as string         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  I put it in a file called codelawl.scpt/code and then ran the following in the Terminal:  precode$ osascirpt lawl.scpt /code/pre  However, it just pauses for a few seconds, then exits without outputting anything.  <answer174515> Applescripts aren't just plain text files. That's likely why this isn't working.   Open Script Editor in your /Applications/Utilities folder, create a new document, and paste your applescript code into there. Save it as a regular .scpt file, and then you should be able to launch that from terminal using the osascript command you mentioned.   <comment205499> see this for how to: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/115373/46541 <comment205502> See [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14551419/listing-all-windows-of-all-applications), especially the [answer by Raymond](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26196136/565489) for a short solution.
