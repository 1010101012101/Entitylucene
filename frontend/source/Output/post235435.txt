Red tint and flicker in Macbook LCD <body> For some time my aging 2008 Macbook's LCD has been "flickering" a bit but since it goes away after a while I've ignored it.   But in the last few days a red tint (might be pink - I am color blind :( ) has appeared in the bottom left corner that extends to about the half way point of the LCD. Initially it is quite red but after a little while it fades away though not completely, there is still a noticeable difference between the left and right corners if you look carefully.  It this a sign of the end? Is there anything I can do? My google search reveals similar red tints but with the entire screen.   <answer263936> It's the motherboard the video chip has came unsoldered known issues with them   <comment287954> Have you tried calibrating the screen?  It's located in System Preferences -- Display -- Calibrate.  Considering you're color blind, you might want to ask someone to help you with that. <comment288055> Likely a sign of a dying GPU/screen/cable. Have you run AHT/some video stress program? <comment330707> Welcome to Ask Different!  We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.
