iPhone 4 with iOS7 causes skips in bluetooth audio <body> I have an iPhone 4. Everything worked great in iOS6. Ever since I updated to iOS7 I have had a problem described exactly by the user of this post, quote:     Whenever I happen to wake the phone or otherwise use the phone in any   way, the audio skips momentarily, just like the old Discman days.   This not only happens when connected to the bluetooth of my car, but also a set of bluetooth headphones that I have. Has anyone encountered this problem and found a solution?
