Deleted AppleColorEmoji@2x.ttf from my iOS device <body> I read about a way to add iOS 8.3's new emojis to jailbroken iOS 8.1.2 devices and I made it but I deleted the iOS 8.1.2 file by mistake.  Now I want to get back to the old emojis. I deleted the tweak but now I don't have the iOS 8.1.2 AppleColorEmoji@2x.ttf file. I can't open the emoji keyboard as it crashes because the file doesn't exist.  How can I get the old file?  <answer183484> This file is copyrighted (or licensed) by Apple, so it will be difficult to find a download site for it. You can  ul lireset and restore your iPhone to iOS 8.3 (and lose the jailbreak for now)/li lidisable the Emoji keyboard for the time being/li /ul  <comment218743> sounds like you should RESTORE your device.
