Can't boot on OS X partition after resizing Windows partition <body> I initially had three bootable partitions:  ul liOS X/li liRecovery for OS X/li liBootcamp (Windows 8)/li /ul  Now, on Windows, I decided to make my Windows partition smaller, reducing its size using the native Disk Manager. I did, leaving some unallocated space at the end of the disk. Then I restarted my macbook while holding 'alt' and I was surprised to find only one bootable partition:  ul liBootcamp (Windows 8)/li /ul  Confused, I decided to revert my changes by re-expanding my Windows partition to its original size. The disk mapping looks just the same as before, except I still can't boot on OS X or Recovery for OS X, because they aren't displayed at all on Startup Manager of my macbook.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ffj3Q.png" alt="four partitions on disk"  How to fix EFI (or whatever is causing the problem) and boot again on OS X?  [emedit: small note, this issue was long time ago... I have reinstalled the whole computer since then/em]  <answer163743> May I recommend trying rEFIt? It's a boot loader for EFI partition tables. You can put it on a USB stick and boot from there - it may be able to recognise the OS X partition or otherwise repair your EFI table.  You can download rEFIt here.  <answer178607> Presumably Windows messed up with your OS X boot code. You have to rebuild this code. Since OS X tools can not handle a false flagged partition you have to set the correct partition flag and afterwards rebuild the boot code using OS X Disk Utility.  Since you can't boot from the now unaccessible recovery partition you have to have Linux-tools and a second Mac (accessing your messed up hard disk via target mode 2nd stage) or a OS X install DVD/USB-key by the hand.  Let's go:  Download the latest gParted iso file here: gParted  Burn the iso to a CD or transfer it using the tool of your choice to a USB drive. For help to create a gParted Live-USB look here: Live-USB  Boot your Mac using gParted-Linux.  Go to the gParted-tool.  (First window will be opened automagically on the desk.) Select the (probably your first) HFS+ partition and do the right click. Be aware, this is not the first 200 MB EFI-partition!!!  Now edit the partition info.  ul liTick the square for the msft-type. /li liRemove the mark. Do not mark any of the available marks./li liWrite out the changes. /li /ul  Leave the tool and reboot into a OS X-Install-DVD or prepared OS X install-USB-key (or as forementioned connect your dead Mac-HDD to the other Mac via Firewire or TB now accessing the disk in target mode)  Open OS X Disk Utility.   ul liTick on the Apple HDD, let Disk Utility repair the partition layout. /li liCheck the OS X-partition too and reboot into your OS X again./li /ul  Hold the alt-key and choose the OS X boot volume.
