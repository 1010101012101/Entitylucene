How do you bind a key sequence to shell command? <body> Using stock Terminal.app on El Capitan, the effort is to set up a shortcut in a sense, that upon press it would execute a specific command.  Consulting codeman/code pages for codebind/code command following steps have been taken but yielded no results.  strongFirst approach/strong was to place the setting inside code~/.inputrc/code file and let the login session do its work. The current state of the file is:  precode"\C-s": "ssh hostname" /code/pre  strongSecond/strong, used codebind/code command directly.  precode$ bind '"\C-s": "ssh hostname"' /code/pre  appendix:  GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin15)  <answer250775> Add a newline character to the end, for example:  precodebind '"\C-s": "ssh hostname\n"' /code/pre  Another thing is what key sequence you want to bind the command to, and if it's not already handled by the system. For example, for kbdF12/kbd, which is available, you'd use:  precodebind '"\e[24~": "ssh hostname\n"' /code/pre  <comment311538> The second suggestion worked as advertised. However, I was not able to replicate it with the first one, not even using different set of letters. Anyway, I thank You.
