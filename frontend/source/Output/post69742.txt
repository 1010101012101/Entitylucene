How to install Mac OS X from Windows on MacBook Air? <body> I have OS backup .dmg installation file. The problem is I have Windows 7 on my MacBook Air, and I do not have access to OS X to use Disk Utility to burn/restore the OS X image.  Is it possible to burn/restore .dmg file on usb stick from Windows?  <answer69744> Several programs that support opening DMG files:  7-Zip will let you unzip the files.  You can rebuild and burn an ISO image from there. http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/  A search around the web brought up TransMac as being able to directly burn a DMG to disk: http://www.asy.com/sharetm.htm  Same goes for UltraISO: http://www.ezbsystems.com/ultraiso/download.htm  ... but I've not tried them.  <answer69833> You dont need accessing it from windows.   Boot the computer holding the [option] key and choose the OSX recovery. Inside it there you'll have a very basic osx with its own Disk Utility to restore your DMG image to another USB.  <comment81021> But I do not want to burn on a disk. I would like to put it on my USB stick. <comment81023> TransMac will allow you to create a bootable USB: USB Drive  Format Disk  Format with Disk Image, then select your DMG file.  You can do it with the 15-day trial. <comment81048> It does found he drive when I restart my Mac, but it cannot load the installation. It says "Your computer needs to be restared.." What could be the issue? <comment81227> Not sure.  Give Rostol's solution a shot, I forgot about that little trick and it is a better suggestion then mine.
