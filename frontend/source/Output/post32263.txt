Is there a way to prevent those pesky .DS_Store files from being ever created? <body> Is there a way (eg. a binary hack into Finder) to stop it from creating .DS-Stores on LOCAL Volumes?   I am using Leopard, therefore these don't work:  ul liAsepsis (requires Lion)/li liTotalFinder (requires Snow Leopard)/li /ul  Also, BlueHarvest slows down my computer.  <answer32264> Try this command: emdefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true/em in terminal. It seems to work for me.  <answer32283> I haven't found any way to keep them from being created, but you can delete them automatically with a script:  precode#!/bin/sh  find ~ -name .DS_Store -exec /bin/rm -f -- {} \;  exit 0 /code/pre  Run it every X minutes via codelaunchd/code or codecron/code. It takes almost no time to run on my several-year-old iMac. It will only search your $HOME (~) but that's where most of them will be. Change ~ to / if you want to delete them across the entire drive, but that will take much longer to run, so adjust the frequency accordingly.  <answer57828> h1Third party solutions/h1  In my experience, BlueHarvest is best in class. Technically, it is not an answer to the question; it can remove but strongnot/strong prevent code.DS_Store/code files.   If BlueHarvest is effective but does not suit your use case, it becomes difficult to give an acceptable answer to your question.   If you have no acceptable third party solution, then you must work with what's integral to Leopard …  h1Without a third party solution: restrain your use of Finder/h1  By avoiding the views that you do not wish to save, you can prevent creation of code.DS_Store/code files.   Most users will find it difficult to restrain themselves in this way, but it's a true answer within the limitations of the question.   http://diigo.com/0qiwp for an annotated view of http://lists.apple.com/archives/applescript-users/2006/Jun/msg00180.html where Matt Deatherage (a former engineer at Apple) explains code.DS_Store/code and other types of file.   <answer295991> I've made a more efficient script (intended to be run continuously as daemon), it'll do one execution of codefind/code at the beginning to wipe already existing files and it'll catch new files in real time via fsevents. So they will be nuked immediately as they are created, and resource usage is very low. AFAIK this is the best possible way to get rid of them without disabling SIP.br Here it is — https://github.com/magicgoose/DS_Store-Kill  <answer296000> To prevent those ugly .DS_Store files there seems to be a relatively new option to do this cleanly, not only for network drives, but for USB-connected volumes:  precodedefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true /code/pre  To completely nuke this nasty behaviour on all disks – and with a binary patcher/code injector like the question of the OP longs for – there is DeathToDSStore / with source.   Both of these options assume that anyone still uses Finder…  <comment36975> See: [Prevent MacOS from making .* and ._* files](http://superuser.com/questions/105243/prevent-macos-from-making-and-files) — any specific reason *why* you don't want these? <comment36976> @slhck: blueharvest works, but slows down my computer. I am looking for something like [this](http://asepsis.binaryage.com/) <comment36977> I forgot that TotalFinder only works on ≥ 10.6, sorry. <comment36978> This question would be too localized if it was specific to Leopard and earlier. Answers could just mention the current lowest or highest supported version where applicable. <comment36979> It works only for network, not for local volumes. <comment36980> You are correct. I apologize for my confusion. <comment36998> This is the only real case in which i could see .DS_Stores being annoying. They're hidden on Mac OS by default, and are crucial for saving view settings for individual folders <comment37002> You could also use `find ~ -name .DS_Store -delete`. And don't forget  the `-name` flag — without it the command would apply to all files in `~` and `./.DS_Store`. <comment37011> But I don't want to save view settings. <comment37018> I know that I can use a script, but your answer doesn't answer he question. <comment37223> The answer to the question is "no." There isn't a way to stop them from being created (except on network shares, which also wasn't the question). This answer tries to achieve the same end result. If SE had a category of reply called "Workaround" I would have put it under that. It's certainly no worse of an "answer" than a daemon attaching to a framework (http://asepsis.binaryage.com/), and much safer than hacking into a system binary, and it runs on any version of Mac OS X. <comment37286> Except it doesn't achieve the same end result. Blueharvest is a better workaround (same end result, save for the fact that the computer runs loke a hog). Also asepsis is a driver IIRC. <comment37391> a) I said "tries to achieve the same end result," namely, not having .DS_Store files on your computer. b) "Better" is a relative term, since *slowing down the entire operation of the computer* is a significant drawback. c) asepsis is "a kernel extension and an user-space system-wide daemon" and gets "loaded into every launching process" which is fairly close to what I said. You seem much more interested in telling me I'm wrong than accepting help, so I will stop offering it. <comment37757> Because that doesn’t help. <comment48409> possible duplicate of [How to stop OS X from writing Spotlight and Trash files to memory cards and USB sticks?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6707/how-to-stop-os-x-from-writing-spotlight-and-trash-files-to-memory-cards-and-usb) <comment91862> How does one "use launchd" to do this? <comment358253> @kinokijuf, drop the entitled attitude. When someone offers you *free help,* you don't get to criticize it. It's fair to simply state, *once,* that it's not what you're looking for, but TJ Luoma's defense (which you made sadly necessary) is more than enough of a cue for you to *shut up.* Jeez.
