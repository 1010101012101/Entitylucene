Destroyed user account on OS X with dscl; how to restore? <body> I was trying to create a new user on my OS X Lion machine, and somehow managed to destroy my own user's account. Here are the steps I took; hopefully someone here can recognize what I did, and maybe identify some way around this.  First, I ran these commands:  precodesudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch sudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch /bin/bash # mistake! sudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch UserShell /bin/bash sudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch RealName "Elastic Search" sudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch UniqueID 503 # MY uniqueID sudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch PrimaryGroupID 1000 sudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/elasticsearch NFSHomeDirectory /Local/Users/elasticsearch /code/pre  The big mistake I made here was using "503", which was my user's UniqueID. Immediately my shell username changed to "elasticsearch". I fiddled around, tried to change the current user with codesudo su -u sritchie/code, but this didn't work.  On restart, only the "Elastic Search" user was available. I logged into the Lion Recovery partition and reset the root password.  After logging in as root and checking on the terminal, I made the remarkable discovery that my home folder was totally empty. I deleted the codeelasticsearch/code user, but it made no difference. I don't see anything in codeDeleted Users/code either.  The odd thing is that when I log in now as myself (codesritchie/code) I can see desktop icons with previews. I can even open a few text files from the Downloads folder if I use the dock alias to Downloads.  Could this data be hiding somewhere? Any help would be REALLY appreciated!  Thanks, Sam  <answer31326> I hope you took a backup of your machine before the codesudo/code command that deleted your account was run. If you have a (Time Machine) backup, you should be able to restore your deleted account &amp; files to a point in time before the deletion occurred. Otherwise, you're probably out of luck.
