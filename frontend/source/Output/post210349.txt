How do I play an album starting from nth song in iTunes <body> I'm new to iTunes and trying to make sense of it's difficult UI. Let's say I have Bob Dylan Essential's, and I want to play it starting from 2nd song of disc 2. I double click this song in my library but, instead of playing all songs starting from this one, iTunes shuffles the entire album into the Play Next section. I've takes a screenshot with the result:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIjrn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How do I play all songs in order, starting from a particular one?  <answer210353> Sometimes it's just a case of persuading iTunes to actually strongStop/strong rather than strongPause/strong  When you first launch iTunes it is Stopped - the top menu doesn't contain any current song info. If at that point you hit Play, it will actually start from just the first song in the list &amp; continue on down the page [assuming you don't have shuffle enabled, of course].br If you double-click any track instead, then it will do the same, from that track - which is what you want...so...  To make it actually Stop, whilst it's playing, hold kbd Alt ‚å• /kbd &amp; click the Pause button strongII/strongbr subYou might also notice the rewind button changes to a kind of 'orbiting' icon - that's to start Genius based on the current track - but not relevant to this issue./sub  Once stopped, it ought to return to 'normal' behaviour.  If it doesn't, an alternative is to enable, then disable shuffle. That should also revert to linear play mode.  <comment253876> Well, iTunes was freshly started when I tried the scenario I described, it wasn't in a paused state. I also took care to clear the Up Next queue before trying it. I will try your suggestion though. <comment253877> Then you're down to toggling shuffle & also toggling Genius from the 'orbit' can help. I find it can get itself confused sometimes, & it seems to be just a case of trying to get it back to some kind of default state. Mine was the same when I first looked at it today, pseudo-random next-up list
