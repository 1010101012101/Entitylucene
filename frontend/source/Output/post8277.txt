Cut command shortcut problem <body> I cannot find the way to change the key shortcut for cut command on my macBook pro.  Where can I change that setting?  I can't find it with the rest of the key command preferences.  <answer8283> On my machine, the following works:  Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Application Shortcuts. Press the [+] button. Select All Applications, type Cut, press your shortcut, and press kbdAdd/kbd.  Note that on systems still running OS X 10.8 and earlier, it's: System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Application Shortcuts  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TypR8.png" alt=""  <comment18594> afraid this doesnt work <comment351219> What do you mean with OMM?
