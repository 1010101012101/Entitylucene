iPhone: Settings > Safari > Databases no longer visible <body> All,  I'm trying to see the local storage databases on my iPhone.  A variety of Google searches made this clear - if you go to "Settings", then "Safari" - you'll see a "Database" panel (just under "Accept Cookies...")  However, on MY iPhone - "Databases" is not listed.  I'm 99.9% sure that I HAVE databases on my phone:  ol liI'm testing an HTML5 application that uses a database. According to the app, the database exists, and I can write to and read from it/li liI use Gmail through Safari - I'm emvirtually certain/em that it uses a database/li /ol  I'm also virtually certain that I recall seeing the "Database" options in the past.  I just upgraded to iOS 4.3.5 - is it possible that this version moved the function to view the databases to someplace besides Settings  Safari? If so, where?  Or, is it a bug that the databases aren't getting displayed?  Thanks in advance!   <answer21623> I was getting a little frustrated... I emknew/em there were local safari databases on my phone, even though they weren't shown in the Settings  Safari panel.  So - as a last resort - I powered off my phone, and restarted. Sure enough, there they were, right where I expected them.
