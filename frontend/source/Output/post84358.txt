Get a copy of iphone lock screen <body> I no longer have the photo I used for my iPhone lock screen, and I would like to retrieve a copy of it, or a full screen shot of the lock screen without the slider bar and time/date display.  Is there a way I can do this?  <answer84396> I wanted to keep a background from an older version of iOS that was no longer available.  I did the following.  ol liTake a screenshot of your lock screen by pressing the strongLock/strong and strongHome/strong buttons simultaneously./li liGet the screenshot onto a computer by email or syncing./li liGo to Google Image Search, press the camera icon, and upload the screenshot./li liFind a suitable copy to download./li /ol  Unfortunately, if it's a photo you took, this won't show any results unless you've also uploaded the photo to the internet at some point.
