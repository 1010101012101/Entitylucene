Clicking on folder in iTerm2 opens in web browser instead of Finder <body> I have iTerm2 v1.0.0.2 and I am correctly able to open folders in my home directory if command-click on them.  However I am not able to open folders on my Desktop or Documents if I command-click them, instead it opens the folder name in my default web browser. How can I change this so it opens a Finder window as well?  <answer97474> That feature is based on the current directory. For example command-clicking codeuntitled\ folder/code works here:  precode$ cd Desktop; ls untitled\ folder /code/pre  But not here:  precode$ cd; ls Desktop untitled\ folder /code/pre
