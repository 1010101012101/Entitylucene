PlayStation app for Yosemite <body> I've been playing around with 'rest' mode today on the PS4 and I have found out I can only sleep and wake it using the PlayStation app on iOS.  I have tried to scan the data packets sent to the PS4 so I can make my own application, However I cannot find what to send to the PS4. Because of this is there a PlayStation or similar application to install on Yosemite? brbrbrbrbrbrbr Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, I just thought it would be the most appropriate place to ask because I need a Mac application.brIf this is the wrong place I shall delete this question.
