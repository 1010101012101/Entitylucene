Can't back up iPad after a hard reset <body> Around two months ago I did the usual drill of backing up my iPad, hard resetting it and then reverting everything from the backup cause it'd been a bit sluggish. While it did help, it also seems to have broken the iCloud backup options - for the said two months, not once have I been able to back up my iPad to the cloud. I just constantly get the "this ipad hasn't been backed up in X weeks" alerts but I can't do anything about it. When I try to force back up from the settings, it tries for a minute or so, telling me it's calculating the time needed for back up but then it just stops, the progress bar disappears and it says that the last back up couldn't be finished.  I'm running the latest iOS, everything else works fine. I've done the reset-restore thing a lot of times over the years and it'd never caused any problems like this. As for my iCloud, I'm only using 1.7 out of my 5GB so it's not like there's no space either.  What else could I try?  <comment360971> Did you try temporarily removing the account, and adding it again?
