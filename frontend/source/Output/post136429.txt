Iphone 5S camera roll keeps 'restoring' <body> My iphone 5S camera roll keeps saying 'restoring' at the bottom. I've tried reboots, hard reset, removing photos, removing icloud, and restoring the phone from a backup. I've checked all my icloud settings on ios, mac and iphoto, and all photo syncing options are unchecked.  Also there's always this spinning loading icon next to the battery icon. Any help would be appreciated, as my battery seems to drain quicker than normal.
