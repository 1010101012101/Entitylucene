Location of the resource files for the spinning wait cursor? <body> For a presentation I am making, I want to find my Mac's system's default "strongSpinning Wait Cursor/strong" resources.  I was told that the cursors are in here:     /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HiServices.framework/Versions/A/Resources/cursors  and here:     /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/Versions/Current/Frameworks/WebCore.framework/Resources/  Indeed, one can find some large and vectorized versions of most cursors in the first folder, and some other, smaller ones in the second.  But, there seems to be no beach ball in there.   emI know one can find the graphics in high resolution online easily,/em but for my project I would need to get the original system files.  A screenshot or animated screenshot also wouldn't be what I'm looking for. I couldn't find the info anywhere.  emNote 1:/em From the GUI, a user can see the spinning wait cursor in emvarious different sizes/em depending on the settings in System Preferences  Accessibility  Display  Cursor size, and then proceeding to crash their computer.  emNote2:/em I am not trying to change my OS' appearance.  Can anyone help me find where the resource is?  Is it hardcoded like the startup chime?  <answer244188> h2Cursors are rendered using CoreGraphics/h2  The emWait Cursor/em or what is sometimes affectionately know as the "spinning beachball of death" is strongrendered/strong in CoreGraphics (Apple's 2D rendering engine). Meaning, they are emgenerated on the fly/em depending on what your preferences are set to (i.e. cursor size).  The CoreGraphics file is located at code/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Versions/A/CoreGraphics/code    From my research I was able to find the parameters for the Wait Cursor: code$23766C - $23D66C"/code  As far as working with images stored in CoreGraphics, I can point you to this tutorial:  Core Graphics on OS X Tutorial  h2Static Images of Wait Cursor/h2  There is a directory that has static images of the cursors:  code/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/Versions/A/Resources/code  Within that directory you will find a number of TIFF files.  The specific file is codewaitCursor.tiff/code  Opening the file with preview (codeopen waitCursor.tiff/code) yields the following graphic (it's quite small):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/btKYf.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  h3How I located the file..../h3  The El Capitan cusors link you provided had broken img src links, so I used the one for Yosemite for reference as they are pretty much the same.  The icon you wanted is called the "Wait cursor."  So, using the codefind/code command in Terminal, I executed the following:  precodefind /System -iname waitcursor* /code/pre  The command basically says starting from the code/System/code directory, look for all files with the name "waitCursor" in it regardless of case.  I guessed the format of the name from the file naming conventions in the directory you initially provided.  For example, the "Resize Down" cursor was called "resizedown".   <answer244718> Here's the El Capitan spinning beachball from materialup.com img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DdOKY.gif" alt="Spinning beachbal "  <comment300874> There's quite a difference between the "wait cursor.tiff" file you're linking to in the OS and the *actual* wait cursor (the El Capitan one has solid colors for starters, not gradients). Also, as you may know, [a setting in Preferences allows to increase the size of the cursors](http://i.imgur.com/XfhdvTC.jpg). [Including the one I'm looking for](http://i.imgur.com/53DIQIS.jpg) :) <comment301176> Thanks for your edit. (1) weird wait cursor (the tiff one), do you know in what situations it appears? Maybe when running "diminished" version of the OS? safe mode, diagnosis mode...?) (2) would you be able to open the CoreGraphics file and produce a screenshot of the wait cursor in your answer? Other than that I'll most probably accept it under 48 hours. Thanks! <comment301186> I have no idea where the TIFF is used; reference maybe?  Also, in the directory you mentioned, there are pdfs of the icons.  I am not in UX/UI so I don't know how to do this.  I'll look it over the weekend, but I can't guarantee anything.
