Applescript wait for keystroke to finish <body> I am writing a script that keystrokes a variable, changes the variable, and keystrokes again, several times in a row. However, it appears to me the variable is being reassigned too quickly for the keystrokes, so a backlog forms and only the final value of the variable is typed multiple times. Is there a way to avoid this without just using a delay?  Edit: Here is my code:  precoderepeat repeatNum times     set the clipboard to some item of myList       tell application "System Events"         keystroke "v" using command down         keystroke return     end tell end repeat /code/pre  I've settled for a 0.15 second delay in my actual program but an answer would still be helpful  <comment355702> It might be more helpful if you'd include the code and conditions of its use so we can see if it could be structured differently to handle the issue.
