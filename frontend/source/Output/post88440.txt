How can I remap keys on a headless mac? <body> At the moment I'm remotely accessing my mac via logmein.  I'm trying to remap Command to Control via system preferences.  However every time I try to do this it keeps resetting to the default.  As best I can tell this is because there is no keyboard plugged in.  Is there some way to remap the keys without a keyboard?  <answer88442> you can use KeyRemap4MacBook  http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/  there are also predefined settings to achieve what you need:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2rZ9.png" alt="enter image description here"
