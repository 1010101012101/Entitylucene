Music not showing up in my library <body> I got the new iPhone 7+ and when I went to my music on it I was not able to download from Purchased in iTunes. I can't find them to show up anywhere. But if I go to iTunes Store to look for the song it says "Purchased". How can I get all of my songs to show back up in iTunes?
