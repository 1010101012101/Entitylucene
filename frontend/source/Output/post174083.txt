Stop Finder from Opening in 1st Space <body> When I have an application that I use the contextual menu for 'Show in Finder' it opens finder, but it always opens it in the 1st space, never in the current space i'm in. For example, I have Xcode in space 3 always, and when I right click and show item in finder it opens the finder window in Space 1 always, same across all other applications and instances. Even worse, it doesn't autonomically teleport to the 1st space I have to manually do it. I'm running 3 monitors which makes it a little more aggrevating  Heres my settings : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6z4A5.png" alt="pic1"  Altering any of the group choices etc don't have any effect.  I would love to have it open in the active or current space i'm in.  <answer174098> You may need to try a little experimentation to get closest to what you need [also it may not always work as expected since Yosemite]  If you right click the Finder icon in the Dock you get the options of   ul liAll Desktops/li liThis Desktop/li liDesktop emn/em [only shows if it is currently assigned to another Space]/li liNone/li /ul  Each has advantages &amp; disadvantages.  ul liAll - will carry every Finder window with you to every Space - can be irritating./li liThis - ought to return you to the assigned Space with any move that brings the Finder to the front, i.e. click on Desktop. [This has been a bit broken since Yosemite &amp; doesn't always work]/li liNone - should give no specific focussed Space &amp; I think might be the one you need. Any new window should open on your current Space./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LnUX9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment204958> Damn I'm dumb ha. Can't believe I forgot about that. Especially when that's how I set my Xcode to always be on 3. Thank you though! I'm a happy camper now
