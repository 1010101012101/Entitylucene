After (HDMI+USB) 2 external monitor usage, I can no longer use the HDMI monitor by itself <body> I attach 2 external monitors to my MacBook Pro (late 2011) using HDMI + USB (Diamond USB to HDMI/DVI adapter). no problem.  However, I just disconnected the USB adapter and now no signal is sent over the HDMI cable. Re-attach the USB adapter, and a signal is sent over HDMI.  There emmight/em have been an installation disk for the USB display adapter, but I sure cannot remember. Such software would be called a "driver" on the MSFT Windows platform.  ul liWhat could be stopping MacOS from sending a signal over the HDMI cable?/li liWhere would I look in emSystem Preferences/em for any "driver-like" software  that might have been installed when I initially set-up this USB display adapter?/li liMy ultimate goal is to attach 3 external monitors. Any recommendations for how to make that happen would be welcomed. The only ports I have are HDMI, USB, and Firewire./li /ul  <comment361513> What happens if you disconnect your HDMI monitor and then plug it back in? <comment361516> @Allan no difference. <comment361518> If you disconnect everything, reboot, then connect the HDMI?
