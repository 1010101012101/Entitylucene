How to logout another user in 10.8? <body> With 10.6 I used to kill the process codeloginwindow/code to logout another user, but with 10.8 I noticed that even if I do so, many processes from that user stay active.  So, is there a way to logout another user in 10.8, other than logging him in or manually killing all his processes?  <answer108751> As an administrator:  precodesudo su - user_to_be_logged_out kill -9 -1 /code/pre  That will log out any user by ending all of the user processes. Use care to not issue the kill -9 -1 as root else some work would be expected to be lost as the system would immediately self-destroy all processes.  There are of course one line commands, but I like having a pause to look and make sure I switched to the correct user before issuing a powerful command like codekill -9 -1/code and I also avoid at all costs having sudo appear before that kill since I don't even want to kill all processes as root.  <answer128617> Like bmike mentioned but combining the commands into an alias that can be used in /bin/tcsh shell. Again this is nice and fast but be careful. Donâ€™t do this on root or yourself.  precodealias ku "sudo su user_to_be_logged_out -c 'kill -9 -1'" /code/pre  <comment127414> OS X now runs process as users even when they haven't logged in for the first time. What problem exactly are you seeking to solve? You can still kill all processes for a specific user and then know the remaining processes were started by the system. <comment127417> @bmike not exactly: if an user never logged in since power up, I see no process belonging to him. The problem I'm trying to solve is, as I said, to logout an user without having to switch to his account to do that. <comment127418> Hmm - all my systems start launchd, distnoted and cfprefsd processes for each local user when the machine starts whether anyone is logged in or not. <comment127422> @bmike I believe you, not sure why it doesn't happen here <comment127425> Just wait till you get to Mavericks when user processes stick around running even after you log that user out from the GUI. I don't doubt what you're seeing either :-) <comment127431> @bmike I've made some more tries, and even here in 10.8 some processes stick around after you logout actually, though they don't start until they login (as I was saying earlier).
