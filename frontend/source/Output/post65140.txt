I've got a new iPod Touch, do I need a new Apple ID for FaceTime and iMessage <body> We have a Mac, iPad2, 1 iPhone 4, 1 iPhone 4s and now have bought an iPod Touch for my son.   What is the best way for the iPod Touch to be able to sync previuosly download apps and music but enable Facetime and iMessage using his own details as my wife's details are used for her FaceTime/Apple ID?  Any help is greatly appreciated.  <answer65145> In iOS 6, you can set different IDs for Communications (FaceTime, iMessage, etc) and Stores (iTunes, App Store, iBooks Store). Let’s say codeone@me.com/code is your wife’s ID, and your son stronghas already created/strong codetwo@me.com/code for his own use. The steps would be:  ol liGo to Settings  iTunes and App Stores. Sign in with codeone@me.com/code./li liGo to Settings  FaceTime and sign in with codetwo@me.com/code./li liGo to Settings  Messages and sign in with codetwo@me.com/code./li /ol  Source: http://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/ios.html  <comment76531> You could’ve waited a week or two and bought your son the fifth generation iPod touch. <comment76573> Many thanks - I had not used ios6 until downloading the update on the new iPod, so many thanks. <comment76623> You’re welcome.
