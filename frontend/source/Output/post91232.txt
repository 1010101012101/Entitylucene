Carbon copy cloner to image OS X lion and restore from disk image <body> Is it possible to create an image of my 64gb 2012 Macbook Air using Carbon Copy Cloner so that I can recover from that image (if my Mac does not boot) when I am not connected to the internet? I can then recover from that snapshot image.  <answer91257> The getting started section of the CCC online documentation will get you on your way.  For Carbon Copy Cloner support, please post questions to the Bombich Software Help Desk  <comment107182> The answer should be self contained here and only use links to gove more information.
