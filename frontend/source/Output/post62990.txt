How to troubleshoot web errors on the Apple developer forum? <body> I have an AppleID and paid $99 dollars to enroll in the iOS Developer program. I tried creating new thread in iOS Developer Forum but end up in blank white screen. I couldn't see anything on the screen.   Has anyone a suggestion on what the requirements (or how to troubleshoot) the developer forum web page when you run into issues?  <answer63006> Usually things like that are caused by browser extensions or an odd interaction between a specific browser version and the code on the site.  Have you looked over the basic support page for the Developer Forums?  https://developer.apple.com/support/resources/developer-forums.html  It has a "contact us" form if you can't solve this by ensuring an up to date (and unmodified) version of Safari isn't rendering the web site properly for you.  <comment72696> Did you quit the browser and try again? Any browser extensions installed? <comment72709> Did you try a different browser? <comment72714> no haven't. I will try it now
