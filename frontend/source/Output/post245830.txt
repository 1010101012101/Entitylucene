What is the purpose of /home on a Mac? <body> On Linux, (which I am used to), /home is the place where home folders live.  On a Mac, home is some kind of crazy mutant:  precode$ mount /dev/disk1 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) /code/pre  Other than to be non-conformist, is there some purpose to this auto_home mount point?  Considering how it mucks up things that come right out of the box, there must be some wonderful thing that it accomplishes, but I can't figure out what that would be.....  <answer245832> It predates Linux was in NeXTStep from 1989  Linux is not Unix and does not meet the Unix specification  auto_home is where in a networked environment you home directory is mounted from a NFS mount  And any decently scripted process won't be affected by /home - if it is what else has it got wrong.  The Unix standard way to find your home directory is $HOME environment variable and home directories are not all of the form /home/X, in fact I have worked at places where the home directories differed in the root mount i.e. some /home/X  others /user/Y
