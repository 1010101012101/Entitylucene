How to create a system wide shortcut and divert it to a app? <body> So I basically want to trigger a app shortcut, regardless if the app is in the foreground or not.  How to achieve that?  <comment289785> Since you've not provided any details of the target App and specific keyboard shortcut you want to trigger... The short answer, using what's available out of the box in OS X, is to create an Automator Service, which you assign a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences, that doesn't step on any existing keyboard shortcuts, and when pressed runs an AppleScript and or Shell Script that if the target App is closed, opens the App and or if already open, brings it frontmost and triggers the App specific keyboard shortcut. <comment289786> @user3439894 Thanks! So the app needs to be brought to the foreground? No way trigger the shortcut while app stays where it is? <comment289790> Generally speaking, key presses and mouse clicks go what has focus.  Obviously there are global keyboard shortcuts that work regardless of what has focus, however most _normal_ applications do not receive input unless they have focus. So I'd have to say that whatever unknown keyboard shortcut of the unknown app you're trying to manipulate will need to have focus in order for it to be processed. Maybe a third-party app like [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) can do it differently.
