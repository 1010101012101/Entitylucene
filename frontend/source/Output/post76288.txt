Isolate OSX Dock per Space <body> How can I make it so that each space has its own isolated dock?  Basically what I'm looking for is:  ul liThe dock in one space should not show the icon of an app that was open in another space./li liIf I have the same program open in two different spaces, clicking on the icon in one space should not go to the app in the other space./li /ul  Is this possible natively, or with a third party program?  <answer76440> As mentioned in the Independent docks across displays thread, you can't do it with the native Dock system.  You will need a third party utility like DockSpaces.  <comment88642> Considering how the Dock works, I don't see any way this is possibleâ€¦ I might just be missing something though.
