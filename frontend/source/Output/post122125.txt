Google Chrome Starts With Hidden Instances <body> So - weird things today.  Because of another issue, I had to close google chrome and restart it. When it restarted, Pandora started playing - however, there is no pandora to be found. No window nor tab.  I thought I'd be able to figure out where or what was going on with the Activity Monitor - but I found very little to indicate which instance (if any at all) was hiding and playing pandora stations. So, my next step was to run codeps aux|grep chrome -i/code with very little helpful information, just a slew of instances. Figured I'd try running codeps aux | grep 'pandora' -i/code which returned nothing at all.  So - I have an invisible pandora tab playing pandora somewhere. Obviously I could try re-starting chrome, but that's not the point. The concern is that this is even happening at all. Is this a flash issue? Do I need to worry about youtube playing via mysterious phantom chrome instances?  If anyone can help me with this, I would be ever so grateful!  <comment142484> what was the issue with Google chrome to start with ? <comment142490> what chrome add-ons do you have running
