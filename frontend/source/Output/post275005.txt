Connect to printer on Windows PC via smb - authentication required <body> I have laptop with macOS Sierra 10.12 and shared printer Kyocera_FS_1120MFP_GX which is connected to PC with Windows 7.   If I connect it directly to my laptop via USB it works, but if I try to connect it via local network it show me codePrint queue/code window with codeHold for Authentication/code.  For other windows PCs it works ok. I tried some commands in terminal: codelpstat -p/code shows codeprinter Kyocera_FS_1120MFP_GX is idle. Authentication required/code  codelpstat -s/code shows codedefault Kyocera_FS_1120MFP_GX: smb://ks2-pc/Kyocera%20FS_1120MFP%20GX/code  Also I tried  codesudo lpadmin -p Kyocera_FS_1120MFP_GX -o auth-info-required=negotiate/code but it change nothing.  How to fix it?  <answer275014> Figure it out: You should open codekeychain access/code tool and find there your printer name in the keys list and remove it.  After that open codePrint queue/code window and select in the top menu: codePrinter/code - codeprint test page/code.  Window with login password will appears. Print there username - codeguest/code without password.  After that printer should work.
