Apple Music - How to automatically save everything that it added to My Music? <body> I would like to know if there's a way in which every time I add a song or album into "My Music", it is saved in the device automatically, without selecting the option "Save for Offline".  <answer193944> Theres no way to do that as of now, maybe that feature will be added later though. You can automatically download all of the songs in a specific playlist though.  <answer218551> I've written a short blog post explaining how to do this.  You create a smart playlist with a single rule which checks if the codeiCloud Status/code equals codeApple Music/code. Check the codeMake Available Offline/code setting for this playlist and all Apple Music songs/albums will be automatically downloaded when you add them to your library.  <comment231264> Just as spotify at the beginning, hope they add this feautre. Thanks. <comment300953> You are able to make a Smart playlist (in iTunes only, however) that will auto-update and you can set that be available offline.
