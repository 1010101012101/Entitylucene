Is there some kind of certification for Apple developers? <body> I'm looking for a certification as an "Apple developer" but I don't know if that exists.  I found http://training.apple.com/certification but it only offers certification for OSX and Apple software like FinalCut.  <answer55388> There is no official certification. There are, though, strongnon-Apple-official/strong courses which are highly reputed, such as Big Nerd Ranch's, for instance.  <answer246527> Yes there is now Official Certification as Well.   http://training.apple.com/en/certification  <comment63579> +1 if you have a BNR course, you're usually good to go. <comment304031> There do not appear to be any developer certifications from Apple, only exams for IT and Creative professionals. <comment304036> Well the link above express then for mac professionals. <comment327740> I think if you have made 3 or more great "apps" (maybe you have already, of course), it is a good or way better as any cert some 3rd party would offer.  I can understand certs to supplement job experience like teaching or Firewalls, but devs can show a portfolio basically.
