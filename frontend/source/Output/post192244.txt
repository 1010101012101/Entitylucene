From the Apple support site:     If you turn on Optimize [device] Storage, iCloud Photo Library will automatically manage the size of your library on your device, so you can make the most of your device's storage and access more photos than ever. All of your original, full-resolution photos and videos are stored in iCloud while device-size versions are kept on your device. You can download the original photos and videos over Wi-Fi or cellular when you need them.    <answer277810> h1Free Options [with more space]/h1  h3Google Photos/h3  If you are trying to free up quite a bit of photos without them being a stock app, and not paying for storage, a possible option could be Google Photos.
