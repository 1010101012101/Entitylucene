Force macbook to sleep when lid closed and external monitor connected in Lion <body> I know you have heard this before, but is there any app/hack that makes the computer behave like Snow Leopard when closing the lid?  I don't want to hear about this being a duplicate question, as I want a solution not an explanation.  Only post here if you have a solution that makes the macbook behave like in Snow Leopard when closing the lid.  <answer20285> In previous versions of OS X, you would go to ~/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration to find a file called com.apple.PowerManagement.plist. In that file you would find ways to tweak things like the old "clamshell" mode. I have not looked in Lion yet to see if this still exists, but if the file is still there, you may want to take a look at what it allows you to control. Hope this helps.   <answer22326> Not sure if it will still work with Lion, but on SL I use InsomniaX when I want to close the lid and prevent my mbp from sleeping. Check out the following links for similar programs:  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/22211/insomniax  http://alternativeto.net/software/insomniax/  <answer84661> I made a LaunchAgent which does this. The source code can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Tyilo/Lid-sleep  <answer84663> This worked in 10.7 and 10.8 with my MacBook Air:  precodesudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0 /code/pre  After restarting, it should restore the pre-10.7 behavior:  ul liClosing the lid puts a laptop to sleep even when it is connected to an external display/li liIf you then wake the laptop up and open the lid, the internal display doesn't turn on/li /ul  To undo it, run codesudo nvram -d boot-args/code or hold ⌥⌘PR on startup.  <answer258976> I had this issue too, and came up with this script that monitors your lid state and puts the machine to sleep when lid is closed: https://github.com/pirj/noclamshell  <comment21971> possible duplicate of [Why won't closing the lid sleep my MacBook Pro with external monitor attached after upgrading to Lion?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18037/why-wont-closing-the-lid-sleep-my-macbook-pro-with-external-monitor-attached-aft) <comment22001> Not a solution, but remember you can always use ⌥⌘⏏ to sleep the computer. <comment22016> Not even realized this as I usually close the lid and switch off immediately the external monitor... :-/ <comment22017> @LudoMC have had my macbook running in the night three times now, because I forgot to remove the cable to the external monitor, as I also switch my monitor off immediately :S <comment22019> @Tyilo Just ran an uptime command which shows mine is up for more than 3 days now! Hopefully I now know I have to manually put him at sleep. <comment22464> Please clarify precisely what behaviour you want, that closing the lid always triggers sleep? <comment22466> @dan8394 external monitor connected; close lid; mac sleeps <comment22591> There is the option for "Wake On Clamshell Open", but not "Sleep On Clamshell Close", or something similiar.

Perhaps filing a radar could help it? <comment22856> @Akku Filing a radar? What is this? <comment22860> It's a support system they use at Apple where you can file bugs and other inconveniences. I never did this myself, therefore I suggested it here in hope that someone else would do it :-) <comment22868> @Akku wow great: http://cl.ly/984A <comment22887> :-) Hope they'll fix this, it really annoys me. <comment24032> Just a word of warning - I used my MacBook Pro with the lid closed and an external monitor for a few months - but now the fans make a decidely 'used' noise - I blame the fact that the fans were overworked as the MacBook fans vent through the gap between the display and the keyboard, and this is blocked with the lid closed. <comment24765> I don't want to prevent the Mac from sleeping. I want it to sleep when I close the lid! <comment24970> @tyilo: oops, totally read that backwards :) <comment28678> left my answer up in case that app helps someone with the opposite problem... <comment171893> This worked for me on a 10.9.4 Macbook Air! BUT... Is there a way to have the internal display turn on when you wake on the laptop? <comment172646> @Akku, in addition to radar-filing, there's their simple feedback page: http://www.apple.com/feedback/ <comment172647> This worked for my MBP running Mavericks, but only if I disconnected the power and monitor before running the command, rebooting the Mac, and then reconnecting the power and monitor. Not sure if it was the rebooting, the disconnecting, or both. <comment193055> Does it work in Yosemite? How would I use this LaunchAgent? Thank you.
