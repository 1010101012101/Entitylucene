Modifier key changes are ignored <body> Under "System Preferences" - "Keyboard" - "Modifier Keys", I swapped the option and command key. However, these changes are ignored. I tried booting in safe mode: here it works as expected!   This issue is also discussed here: keyboard preferences ignores modifier key settings - However, this solution does not work, because it is not an external keyboard. I am using a Macbook Air running macOS 10.12.3.   There is also some discussing here:  Modifier key settings not sticking - none of the suggested solutions work.   This happened after I was playing around with Input Sources, Ukelele, and Karabiner-Elements. I have since deleted all of these apps and restarted several times. The problem persists.
