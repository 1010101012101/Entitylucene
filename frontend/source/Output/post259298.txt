How to remove calendar event without the sender's notification - serious privacy problem <body> The facts:  ul liToday I got into my iCloud calendar, an event from some "fake ray ban" scammer/seller./li liThe calendar is shared/synced with my iPhone (iCloud)./li /ul  Unfortunately, when I pressing the delete, the calendar popup told me that deleting the event means also strongdecline it/strong and the sender strongwill be/strong notified.  I want remove the event strongwithout/strong notifying the sender, because the event is sent to zillion other generated email addresses and I strongdon't want confirm my address/strong by "declining" the event.  This is a strongvery serious/strong Apple's calendar privacy problem. If there isn't an simple solution, it is enough reason for me stopping using the insecure Apple's calendar.  So, could someone please provide an strongstep-by-step help/strong how to:  ul liRemove the event from my notebook's calendar./li liAlso from my iCloud-synced iPhone's calendar./li liAnd strongwithout/strong the sender's notification./li /ul  <answer259305> I found this free workaround over on Superuser  Basically, you disable networking, delete the event, then delete the notification from email:  ol liTurn off networking on your Mac/li liDelete the event from iCal/li liWait for the notification to show up in your Outbox/li liDelete email from Outbox/li liTurn back on networking/li /ol  Once networking is back on, the sync will remove the other events from iCloud and your Phone.  Echoing Jamie Santa Cruz's comment below, you should strongemdefinately/em/strong block the sender.  You have already confirmed your email becuase it (probably) already sent a notification that you accepted; best to be safe and not sorry.  As to your second question, "...it is enough reason for me stopping using the insecure Apple's calendar?" it would generate too much opinion to go into.  That said, I personally use Office365 Exchange Online ($48 for the year), Outlook.com, OneDrive and Azure for my cloud services with my iMac, MacBook Pro, XServe and (soon) a refurbished Mac Pro.  I don't know if that says anything...  <answer260144> I had a similar issue but with a repeating event sent in Chinese script. The event repeated every day indefinitely and there was no option to delete without sending a delete confirmation to the Sender.  A bit of digging revealed that this is likely an invite sent directly to the iCloud calendar.   To try to stop this I have set that calendar invite to "Email" (you need to do this on the web icloud calendar options SettingPreferencesAdvancedInvitationsEmailTo). Hopefully, nothing will be inserted into my calendar now without me accepting.  To remove the offending event,  I created a Spam calendar on iCloud Calendar on the Web, moved the event to the Spam Calendar (on my mac), then deleted the Spam calendar (again, on the Mac).   Everything now seems to be in order.  <comment324438> Also, look for the invite on your email and block the sender. <comment324441> Seems like this should be possible without the workaround.  But I suppose given that you've already sent an acceptance, this limitation (sort of) makes sense.  On a related note—just curious—can you accept a calendar invitation in the first place without sending a notification? <comment324442> What a ridiculous workaround for something that's a default option on Gmail and Microsoft Exchange <comment324461> I don't know what else I would have expected from Apple. <comment324790> Also make sure you disable automatically adding emailed invitations to your calendar.  That's where this whole problem began, as opposed to seeing that it was spam and just deleting the email. @jm666 <comment324892> See here too: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/258424/spam-icloud-calendar-invitation?rq=1 <comment325092> Accepting the only and most upvoted answer, but can't test it because i disabled my Calendar. <comment325562> @Brick - his answer **does** answer the OP's question - create a "spam calendar and move the event there" - which presumably doesn't notify the sender.  Perhaps a request to clarify rather than a down vote? <comment325583> Rephrased: Is there a way to remove this calendar event without notifying the sender?  @Allan: Ok. I just feel that there has already been a better answer which answers what the OP wants, and this answer is not as good. Thanks.
