Mountain Lion: Use standard keyboard function keys, F1, F2, etc.? <body> I'm having issues with Mountain lion in which I am unable to use my non-Apple keyboard's function keys, i.e. kbdF1/kbd, kbdF2/kbd etc.  Upon firing up codeSystem Preferences/code ➤ codeKeyboard/code, this is what I'm greeted with. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GmG92.png" alt="enter image description here"  In prior versions of the operating system there had been an option here to      Use all F1, F2 keys as standard function keys...   ...which enabled me to utilize the Functions keys, as expected, instead of triggering whatever "Hot Key" usually hijacks that binding ordinarily.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eM7ar.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow can I get this capability back under 10.8.x?/strong  <answer64326> It's still shown for me. Have you tried changing the keyboard type or running codedefaults write -g com.apple.keyboard.fnState -bool true/code and logging out and back in?  <answer64330> I have a Logitech keyboard.  In that case, the option in question is not in the preference pane, as you note.  But there is an option to set this in the Logitech setup utility.  What "non-Apple keyboard" are you using?  <comment108973> As of 10.8.3..  it's back.  I probably did run your `defaults` command… but don't remember if that's what "fixed it"…  so.. you WIN!
