Macbook pro blank screen on every restart after sierra update <body> After installation of MacOS Sierra on my MacBook Air 2013 everything was perfect and I could use computer, but after I restarted MacBook there was only blank screen and nothing happened (only display has turned off, but the computer somehow was working). Keeping the OPTION key held down while starting computer and all other keyboard shortcuts did not work (screen was blank). Holding Shift, also holding Option, also holding Command (⌘)-R, also holding Command-Option-R and holding Command-Option-P-R while starting MacBook did not work (screen was blank). Only keeping R while starting brings to “Recover password” screen, but it is useless. I have managed to start a computer holding C while starting, but I have no idea how to repair my MacBook…
