How to get Ctrl+return key binding for emacs in iTerm2 working? <body> I have kbdControl/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd key bound to a function that I use very often. This works when i run emacs in x-windows. But when I run emacs in iTerm2 control+return just has the effect of line-feed (i.e as if I have just hit enter without holding the control key down). i have tried different variation of this in emacs i  (global-set-key (kbd "&lt;C-return") 'duplicate-line)                                    (global-set-key (kbd "C-RET") 'duplicate-line)                                                  (global-set-key  [(control return)] 'duplicate-line)  /i  None of them seem to work in iTerm/emacs. I'm not sure if this a emacs terminal mode problem or a problem with iTerm2. I don't want to bind this to any other complex key sequence as I use this very often.  How to get Ctrl+return key binding for emacs in iTerm2 working?  <answer68808> I just did a quick test of emacs in iTerm2 and Terminal. Both see CTRL-RET as simply RET.  I did this with codeCTRL-h k/code to see what the key is bound to.  <answer290697> You should be able to map the CTRL-RET to anything you want by making a Profile. Editing the Profile.  In the strongProfile/strong dialog box use the emKeys/em tab to img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgh3q.png" alt="edit the sequence" that gets sent when you press the keys.  I am not sure what sequence you need to send.    Hope this helps.  <comment80384> And? What did you conclude? I knew it was sees CRTL+RET as just RET. Simple way to test it is C-h k C-RET and you will see it shows help for RET. My question was how to fix this problem. <comment80391> Sorry, looks like I misread your question and so I didn't really answer it.
