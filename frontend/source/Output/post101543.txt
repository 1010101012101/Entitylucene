Problem with Youtube in Safari <body> First of all I don't have Flash (or Java). On youtube I use the codeHTML5 video/code feature to view videos. I found a strange thing: most of the videos I find play well without any problems, but when I click on this particular video and go directly to its page on youtube, I get an error that this video is not supported, please install flash player. But I can view this video on the original site if it's inserted. What might be the problem? Why can't I play this video directly on youtube?  <comment119637> It is extremely difficult to understand your question. Could you try to use the Google translate from your language to English :) <comment119641> Some YouTube videos just don't allow playing via the HTML5 format.
