How to save sent messages in same folder as message being replied to? <body> One of my favorite features back when I used Outlook was the option to save sent emails in the same folder as the message being replied to. For example, if I had moved a message to folder A and was replying to that, my reply was saved in A, not Sent. (If I replied to a message in my Inbox, my reply went to the default Sent folder.)  This made it really easy to see an entire thread when I came back to it later. This workflow is a huge time-saver for me and is the only thing I miss from Outlook. Right now, I manually move sent messages to the folder with related messages which is tedious. Is there a way to recreate this feature from Outlook with Mac Mail? (I'm using Mac Mail 6.2 on OSX 10.8.2).  <answer79836> Mail can be extended to mimic pretty closely the feature you mention from Outlook.   OS X provides a feature called strongservices/strong that can be used to extend the functionality of an application (see http://www.macosxautomation.com/services/learn/index.html for more information).   I will use Automator and AppleScript to create a service that moves sent messages to the folder of the message being replied to, and then assign the standard reply keyboard shortcut (kbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd) to the service:  ul liClose Mail./li liOpen Automator in folder codeApplications/code and choose Service:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hvADn.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liSelect emUtilities/em under emLibrary/em and drag emRun AppleScript/em to the empty pane on the right:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/59pKk.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liConfigure the service to receive no input in Mail:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qop4.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liReplace the contents of the emRun AppleScript/em action with:  precodeon run {input, parameters}  tell application "Mail"     try         (* Get selected messages or exit *)         set messageSelection to selection         set selectedMessage to item 1 of messageSelection         set replyMessage to reply selectedMessage opening window yes         set messageID to message id of selectedMessage         set currentMailbox to mailbox of selectedMessage     on error         return     end try     repeat         (* Wait until reply message is sent *)         delay 2         try             if replyMessage is not visible then exit repeat         on error             exit repeat         end try     end repeat     synchronize with (account of currentMailbox)     (* Wait while reply message is being sent *)     delay 10     (* Loop over all sent messages *)     set sentMailbox to sent mailbox of application "Mail"     set allSentMessages to messages of sentMailbox     repeat with sentMessage in allSentMessages         if source of sentMessage contains messageID then             set mailbox of sentMessage to currentMailbox             return         end if     end repeat end tell  return input end run /code/pre  ul liSave with a descriptive name like emReply and Move Sent Message to Current Folder/em. The service will be saved to code~/Library/Services//code. This is what the service looks like:/li /ul/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oMG3Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liOpen System Preferences, select the emKeyboard/em preference pane and then the emKeyboard Shortcuts/em tab./li liSelect emApplication Shortcuts/em, press the kbd+/kbd button and change for application Mail the shortcut assigned to menu item Reply to kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd. We change it to avoid conflicts when assigning kbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd to the service below:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9d6RT.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liSelect emServices/em, scroll down to the service you previously added and set the keyboard shortcut to kbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pYUO.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liOpen Mail. Notice that Reply's shortcut is no longer kbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd, but kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdnkV.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liAlso notice that there is a new service, accessible with kbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/11Pa6.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liNow select a message in a folder, press kbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd, type your reply and send it, in a few seconds you should see the sent message appear in the folder./li /ul  strongThe script has some limitations and side effects:/strong  ul liThe service can't tell canceled and sent messages apart. So, if you press kbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd and then change your mind and close the window, the service will continue executing and check your Sent folder for matching IDs./li liAppleScript doesn't offer any means of getting a list of replies to a message. My workaround is to get the message id of the message being replied to and search it in the sent messages./li liThe sent message can't be moved while being downloaded. AppleScript doesn't return any error message if that's the case, so I added a 10-second delay. A 5-second delay was not reliable in my tests, adapt it to your needs if necessary./li liWhile the service searches the Sent folder, Mail slows down./li /ul  <comment92129> Sorry if my question was not clear. I already have Mail grouping messages by conversation. Let me see if this helps: when I have a thread in a folder and I reply to the thread, I want my reply to go in the same folder, NOT the Sent folder. That way, my reply shows up in the thread as well - not just everyone else's replies to the thread. Does that make sense? <comment92132> You are already using conversations, don't you see your own replies along with other people's replies? Anyway, if conversations isn't exactly what you are looking for I haven't found any way (I checked PreferencesRules) to automatically move sent messages to the folder the original message was located... <comment92171> No, my replies don't get added to the conversation as a separate item. If someone else replies, there is link at the bottom of their email that says "See More from Dave Burns". Clicking on that does show my response. But what I want is the actual email that I sent put in the same folder. <comment92935> The functionality you are looking for can be achieved using AppleScript and Services. I've completely rewritten the answer, please have a look and let me know whether it works for you. <comment99501> I was wondering if you have had a chance to take a look at my answer below. I managed to mimic the Outlook feature you miss with AppleScript and Services. Please let me know if it works for you. <comment100304> Hi, jaume. I haven't had a chance to try it yet although I appreciate the time you put into such a thorough answer. I have since discovered the "Show related messages" button in the Mail toolbar. Although this doesn't solve the original problem I stated, it does make Mail act a bit like GMail where related messages (i.e. the same thread) are all shown together no matter what folder they are in. This seems to be a viable workaround for now. <comment102354> I'm happy you found a workaround. If you ever miss the "reply and move to folder" functionality and try my answer below, please post whether it worked for you.
