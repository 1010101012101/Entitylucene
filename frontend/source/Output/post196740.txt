Interpreting Mac logs: was this computer booted up normally? <body> **UPDATE: Log shows a normal boot up to login screen. Was confused because I was comparing it to a log of a firevault protected computer  BOOT LOGS SHOWN BELOW:  precodeMar 29 15:41:55 localhost bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1434483715 0 Mar 29 15:42:23 localhost syslogd[40]: Configuration Notice: ASL Module "com.apple.AccountPolicyHelper" claims selected messages.

This question (unix.stackexchange.com) is similar to yours and has a couple of good answers.  <comment235085> it was probably your Avast virus scanner, a lousy piece of software (so intrusive) <comment235087> Thanks for the response, what are you saying the Avast virus scanner did/affected? My question is asking if it looks like this computer was booted up by someone else who had it  (not me) .... and if they got passed the login/password screen somehow or did anything.  Thanks <comment235089> That can not be answered from this log, it looks like normal log. You do have the Avast virus scanner that would make changes, and you also have the Wireshark that also does some changes. <comment235090> Okay gotcha, this was the SYSTEM.LOG file. Do you know of any other log files that would be more helpful for determining this ? <comment235092> You need the log from the time stamp when you suspect something, this one goes normally true the log in ect... What is not clear if someone had it, what kind of access did they have? (guest account ?) <comment235094> The log shows "Login Window Application Started" ... does this mean they actually got into an account ? <comment235096> I do not see failed attempts to log in. You can not "reset" account password without admin privilages. As far as your log goes, system continued with the boot process <comment235739> Buscar - Is there a way to see from this log if the hard drive was booted internally or externally (firewire/usb etc.), or information about the computer model itself (model, year, etc) ? Thanks! <comment235743> This message would say the system was booted from a USB drive "rooting via boot-uuid from /chosen: BF8ADF5C-00BA-35F4-89BD-C35F9436ED0C" but I am not sure.
