How can I limit bandwidth for a specific port/app in OS X 10.10 Yosemite? <body> I am running OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and I am looking for a way to limit upload bandwidth specifically on TCP port 8333, so I can run Bitcoin Core to contribute outgoing bandwidth without completely saturating my connection.  Here is a list of utilities I have looked into:  ul liipfw - This has been deprecated since OS X 10.7, and has been removed in OSX 10.10. Unfortunately this also means that any ipfw GUIs are out too (Waterroof, Speedlimit, Noobproof, etc)./li liNetwork Link Conditioner - This allows bandwidth limiting on Yosemite, but only on a system-wide level. I’m looking for a solution that will limit bandwidth only on a specific port, or only for a specific app, so my entire system won’t be affected by the limit./li lipfctl - This is the new tool that replaces ipfw in Yosemite, but there is a lot less help available online, especially on limiting port/application bandwidth./li lidnctl - There is almost no documentation available for this online, but it seems like it may be able to do the job if configured properly. It has been mentioned before in this Stack Overflow question, but the answer doesn't provide any examples on how to use/configure dnctl to limit bandwidth./li /ul  In short, I am looking for a way to limit bandwidth of a specific application/port on OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Does anything like this exist? And if so, how can I use it to limit outgoing traffic for a specific app, or on TCP port 8333?  hr  Here is what I've tried with pfctl and dnctl:  precodeMaximillians-MacBook:~ Max$ sudo pfctl -E Password: No ALTQ support in kernel ALTQ related functions disabled pf enabled Token : 1626248500898813477 Maximillians-MacBook:~ Max$ (cat /etc/pf.conf &amp;&amp; echo "dummynet-anchor \"customRule\"" &amp;&amp; echo "anchor \"customRule\"") | sudo pfctl -f - pfctl: Use of -f option, could result in flushing of rules present in the main ruleset added by the system at startup.

Very powerful otherwise of a gui app.  <comment234528> The help is much appreciated, but I was unable to get it to work. Please see my updated question. <comment256588> It seems like this is limiting the incoming traffic, instead of the outgoing. To limit the outgoing traffic, change `dummynet in ...` to `dummynet out ...`. <comment287546> Hi. Did this work for you? I tried a lot of options, read the manpages, looked here and there,  but could not throttle the bandwidth on a port (29719). I was able to create my anchor, and create pipes of smaller bandwidth, but somehow could not associate a port with the pipes. <comment287547> I was able to create my anchor, and create pipes of smaller bandwidth, but somehow could not associate a port with the pipes. It would be helpful to know the output of `sudo dnctl list` after running these commands. <comment287616> @prasvin I haven't found a solution that's worked for me yet.
