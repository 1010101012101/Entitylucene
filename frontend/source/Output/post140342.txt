I want to show a file in an AppleScript bundle, but shell returns: file not found <body> My Bundle File: codereference.txt/code  My Code:   precodeset bashFile to path to resource "reference.txt" set the reference_data to do shell script "type " &amp; quoted form of (POSIX path of bashFile) display dialog reference_data /code/pre  shell returns:   precodetype: file not found (but the file exists) /code/pre  How i can show this file on a dialog (or in TextEdit)?  <answer140347> The codetype/code shell builtin is used to see how it's arguments would be interpreted as a command.  Try replacing codetype/code with codecat/code and see if that does what you expect.  <answer140349> As Jay said : codecat/code instead of codetype/code work :   precodeset bashFile to path to resource "reference.rtf"  set the reference_data to do shell script "cat " &amp; quoted form of (POSIX path of bashFile) display dialog reference_data /code/pre  But displaying it in a popup my not be very convenient.  precodeset bashFile to path to resource "arguing.pdf" tell application "Finder"     open file bashFile end tell /code/pre  This code will open the file with the default app defined in the Finder.    <comment178014> I create apps for MS-DOS, too. I'm confused with MS-DOS programming. Thanks!
