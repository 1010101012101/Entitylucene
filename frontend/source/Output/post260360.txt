OS X Safari keeps forgetting cookies <body> My Safari constantly keeps forgetting cookies, even during a session. I.e. I might log into this Stack Exchange, and a few minutes later I am logged out again (without even restarting Safari). This also affects other sites (e.g. Google).  However, when looking at "Manage Website Data..." in Safari's privacy settings, it looks like the cookies are there (although I'm not 100% sure about this).

I have also deleted all cookies and started from scratch, however Safari still forgets newly added cookies.  Also, until a few weeks ago, everything ran just fine. Installed extensions are NoMoreiTunes, Save to Pocket, Ghostery and SaveFrom.net helper.  Any ideas on what could be the culprit or something else I could try?  I am running Safari 10.0.1 on OS X 10.11.6 (although the issue already occurred with Safari 9).  strongEdit: Screenshot of Safari's privacy settings, as requested in the comments: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/seGKK.png" alt="enter image description here"/strong  <answer260363> Something you can attempt:  ol liEnter Recovery mode (kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdR/kbd on startup)/li liGo to Utilities - Terminal/li liEnter this command coderesetpassword/code and hit enter. At the bottom of the window that appears, you will see "Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs". Click "Reset" and reboot./li /ol  This will hopefully resolve the permissions issue you're encountering, assuming it is rooted in a permissions issue- perhaps you manually migrated your user folder at some point?   <comment327177> This might have worked - let me check for another day and then accept the answer in case it still works. Thanks already! <comment327929> Seems like the problem has appeared again :-( <comment327943> Could you include a screen capture of `Safari  Preferences...  Privacy`? <comment328106> @danielAzuelos added to the post.
