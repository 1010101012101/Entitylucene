Odd bug in iTerm â€” Why is my name wrong? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d6Rqs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I opened up iterm and it says "jessica-s-phone" I'm not sure what the term for that is. I checked my profile and it isn't there.   <answer117121> It should be the name of your computer. If you go to sharing in the system preferences you should see "Computer Name" there.  <comment136894> That's one of the things I thought it might be, however my PC is still labeled Patrick's Macbook. <comment136897> This doesn't look like an iTerm issue. Someone posted something like this a while ago. Is your computer connected to a WiFi hotspot, by any chance? Also, have you edited .bash_profile (PS1 variable)? <comment136899> Found something: [Terminal has gone weird after screen sharing](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/92513/terminal-has-gone-weird-after-screen-sharing) So, have you enabled screen sharing?
