How to add a guest public ssh key for remote access? <body> I need to add a developers public ssh key to my user account so that he can access my console and help debug a node.JS issue. Any suggestions on where to start  <answer116728> Have them give you their public key, e. g. codeid_rsa.pub/code.  Add that to the end of your code~/.ssh/authorized_keys/code file (e.g. by running codecat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys/code in Terminal).  <comment136524> is that it. So just save the key below my public key file and all is good? <comment136528> Yep, that's it; once you've done they (presuming you have the SSH server running and so forth), your friend should be albe to `ssh yourusername@host.example.com` (or use your IP address which you can see [here](http://www.ipchicken.com)). <comment136535> reminder, he'll have access to your account and all the rights associated with it. <comment136536> Great.
