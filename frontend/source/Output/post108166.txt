In the disk of an iPhone, are both HFSX slices journaled? <body> h1The question/h1  Is journaling enabled for the emsystem/em partition?  h2Background/h2  Answers to three questions show that both HFS slices of the disk are HFSX:  ul liWhat is the file system on iPhone? (2011-10-12)/li liWhat filesystem does iOS use? (2013-02-27)/li liWhat file systems does Apple use in iPhones? (2013-11-01)./li /ul  At least one of the two HFSX slices is journaled.   Table 3.4 of iPhone and iOS Forensics shows that journaling is enabled for the emuser/em data partition.   As Apple sometimes distinguishes between  ul liJHFS+X (journaled, case sensitive)/li liHFSX/li /ul  – so we strongcan't assume that HFSX is always journaled/strong.   h3Types of HFS Plus/h3  iOS and iPhone aside for a moment … Apple's hdiutil(1) Mac OS X Manual Page lists four HFS filesystem types for creation purposes:  ul liHFS+/li liHFS+J (JHFS+)/li liHFSX/li liJHFS+X/li /ul  The less commonly used expression JHFSX is probably an informal abbreviation of JHFS+X.   <comment130367> I'll check and let you know what I find. <comment153657> I just have to know... why do you care?
