Does iphone have an activity/ diagnostic log <body> Don't know whats going on ... I am listening to music and all of a sudden it gets paused. The impression is that i got a call without actually getting it.   I suspect one application, but have no proof its the one.   Is there an activity log i can take a look to see what happens when it happens?  <answer195274> Yes, but it's just a crash log...

This is very common, especially if the headphones don't sit fully into the jack because of lint at the bottom.
