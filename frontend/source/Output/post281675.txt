Disable moving fullscreen windows when clicking on a Dock app <body> In order to organize my workspace I arrange my fullscreen apps in appropriate order, so I know what app is on the left and on the right from my current position.  However when I start an app by clicking on a dock icon and move to the desktop, my current fullscreen window places to the first position automatically, right next after the desktop.  How can I prevent macOS from this automatic change order of windows? It's very annoying to replace them manually again and again.  <answer281679> System Preferences → Mission Control and uncheck ‘Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use’.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KzTLw.png" alt="enter image description here"
