Why is my /usr/local/bin only accessible by root user? Which rights to fix it? <body> I recently wanted to use pod to update the path of a framework.  Cocoapods is installed and can be find here :  precode/usr/local/bin/ /code/pre  But surprise! It is set to root only access :  pre ls -l /usr/local drwx------   504    wheel  bin/ drwxr-xr-x@  john   staff  include/ drwxr-xr-x@  john   staff  lib/ drwxr-xr-x   root   wheel  share/ /pre  hr  So I can't use pod because in any case :  ul lipod install realm     heeeyy dude, you can't access pod cause you are not root .!. /li lisudo pod install realm     heeeyy dude, you canâ€™t use pod as a root! .!. /li /ul  I feel that this folder shouldn't be set as 'root only' because:  ul liIt is in the env PATH of the usr/li ligem install pod in it?/li lihttp://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/usr.html basically says :     '/usr/local' is widely regarded as a good place in which to keep self-compiled or third-party programs. /li /ul  I know Linux isn't a BSD but still, it doesn't look that much different no o.O  hr  Finally here are my questions:  ul listrongI searched and there is no user with the uid 504, is this suspicious?/strong/li /ul  (I checked it with ""dscacheutil -q user | grep 504"")  ul listrongWhat are suposed to be the rights and owner on the folder?/strong/li listrongIs there someone who had the same problem?/strong/li listrongAny idea about why this happened?/strong/li /ul  <answer258988> The /usr folder is protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP) and owned by root, as are all of its contents, with the sole exception of /usr/local (and its subdirectories).  The root user is uid 0, not 504. The 500-series should be user- or app-created accounts. /usr/local/bin on my system is owned by my username "tubedogg" in group "admin", and has codedrwxrwxr-x/code as the permissions.  <answer258991> The code/usr/local//code itself is owned by coderoot wheel/code for me. But all folders that you might use as pods user codebin include etc lib opt share var/code are owned by my user and admin group.  To change the ownership of a folder and files in it run: code sudo chown -R john:staff /usr/local/bin chmod -R 755 /usr/local/bin /code  <answer258993> The default setup for /usr/local is shown here  precode~ $ ls -ld /usr/local drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  102  5 Aug 20:01 /usr/local  /code/pre  this means that files and directorries under /usr/local can only be created by the root user e.g. my /usr/local has  precode~ $ ls -l /usr/local total 0 drwxr-xr-x  12 root  wheel  408 11 Sep 12:11 bin /code/pre  So your share directory looks normal but the others have odd changes  include and lib look like you changed the permissions of /usr/local so you could write to it and then created these two directories (The most common setup like that is installing Homebrew) (we need to see what codels -ld /usr/local/code shows.  As for bin there must have been several things. First a new user must have been added at some time, normal users (created through the System Preferences GUI start at 501) e.g. I am the second user and so my id is 502 and then the directory was created or chowned to that user- or the directory was created elsewhere and then moved as root to where it is.br Separately the permissions of the directory have been changed by codechmod 700/code  So the correct setting is as per /usr/local/share unless you are using Homebrew in its default install and then they should be like /usr/local/include  <comment323861> Did you ever use MacPorts or something similar? The reason I ask is on my system, uid 504 is polkituser which is apparently sometimes created by MacPorts, so it's possible it was a user that has since been removed. <comment323863> I think I used it once yes, so it might be this I guess. Thank you~ <comment323864> Thanks for the answer! I'll update these rights \o/ Yes I know that the root ID is 0 but the rights on the folder are  drwx------ so only root could access it, that's what I meant. I didn't know for the 500+ IDs, thank you <comment323872> Thanks for the answer! Can't upvote the answers tho o/ (not enough reputation) <comment323873> I found an old wireshark file in /usr/local/bin that was owned by the uid 504! (since removed) I have only RubyGems and Macports installed, no Homebrew `ls -ld /usr/local` shows `drwxr-xr-x root  wheel  /usr/local/` Thank you!
