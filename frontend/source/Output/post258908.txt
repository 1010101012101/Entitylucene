Can I use automator to generate videos? <body> Let's say I have:   ul liA txt file /li liA 1920x1080 image/li /ul  I would like to generate a video like this where text is scrolling and audio is the output of the codesay/code command using automator (even a bash script is enough).  I was digging a bit with ffmpeg but with no success.  Can you help?  <answer258910> Automator can help script other applications but it is not able to create new content alone, such as movies.  h1Keynote and Other Alternatives/h1  Have you considered using Apple's Keynote? Keynote can be used to create QuickTime movies involving impressively complex motion. Keynote supports AppleScript and can be automated.  Alternatively, the inexpensive and capable Motion is worth trying.  A more technical approach would be ImageMagik to create individual frames of the video and codeffmpeg/code to stitch the frames together with music.  <comment323762> That's why I asked automator. I would like to make them even overnight, so I guess it's a bash script what I really need. <comment323763> I have extended the answer to mention AppleScript and added `ImageMagik` as a third alternative.
