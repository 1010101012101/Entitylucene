What do the new Terms and Conditions for the iTunes Store mean? <body> In the new Terms and Conditions for the iTunes store, it says that the following has changed:     Notification of an additional type of previously purchased content   that may be subsequently downloaded to certain computers and devices   as an accommodation to you, subject to existing association rules; and   that such content may be played back on certain devices that are not   subject to existing association rules, with limitations.   What does this mean?  <answer24165> It means you can download TV shows you've purchased in the past for different Apple devices, though it may not always be available to download at all times.  Source  <comment27057> Thanks.  I'll take your word for it.  Some day, when I have no job and no life, I'll read the forty pages or so of legalese in the agreement, and find out what it actually says in there. :P <comment27068> "Some day, when I have no job and no life, I'll read the forty pages". Then you will also lose your sanity ;-)
