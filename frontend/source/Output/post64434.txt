How can I keep Java 7 up to date? <body> As far as I understood Apple provides only Java 6 for Mountain Lion.  Here I found how to install and use Java 7.  However I suppose that by installing Oracle Java it will not be update by means of the Mac App Store. How can I be sure that Oracle Java is always up to date, even better automatically (at least with a notification of "ready to update")?  <answer64443> You may not have noticed it, but Oracle Java 7 installs a new item in System Preferences with a feature that automatically checks for updates by default, and prompts you to install them. Thus, this is taken care of.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wblyg.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V99Jr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment76520> Does it automatically check as it just tells me the Java is out of date and press a button to update now <comment80270> @WheatWilliams Does this update the Java Plugin for internet or also the Oracle JDK stored in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/`? The utility sais that I have Java 1.7 u9 while `java -version` sais Java 1.7.0_07-b10 <comment80312> Personally I don't understand the current confusion between Apple's release version of Java and the browser plugin, and the new independent Java release. Things seem to be in a state of flux. Can anyone explain the situation please?
