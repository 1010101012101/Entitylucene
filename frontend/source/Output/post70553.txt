Solver Window Resize in Mac Office 2011 <body> br For what ever reason the Solver add-in for Mac Office's Excel 2011 produces the following dialog box when attempting to add a constraint to Solver:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9MSKb.png" alt="Add Constraint Dialog"   Does anyone have a similar problem? Or know how to rectify this?  Many thanks.  <comment140324> Can you provide more info about your machine and specifications? <comment140389> Hi @Robuust, I am afraid the machine I had this issue on was stolen. It was a late 2010 Mac Pro running Lion.  It was over a year since I had this issue but I believe a re-install of Solver corrected the issue
