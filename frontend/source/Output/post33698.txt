OSX 10.7.2 can't shut down <body> When i click on shutdown nothing happens. I've tried repairing and verifying the hard-disks. Rebooting in safe mode, resetting PRAM, SMC. Nothing seems to work.  The only 2 ways i can shutdown now is by pressing and holding the power button and typing "shutdown -h now" in terminal. Can anyone help me?  <comment38451> It would be useful if you'd include the kernel log, especially the shutdown related parts. <comment38456> I think I've experienced the same thing. A background process gets stuck and prevents the shutdown. For me, it doesn't do this if I log out and then shutdown from the login window. <comment38457> If you open Activity Monitor, are there any processes that are red (not responding)?  Be sure to look at All Processes (dropdown at the top right).
