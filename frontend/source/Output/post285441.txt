Microphone not working on third party apps only (iPhone 6) <body> Recently my iPhone's mic has stopped working but solely for third party apps such as Whatsapp, Snapchat &amp; Telegram.   I have tried the following:  ul liRestarting my phone/li liUpdating my phone to the latest version/li liUsing compressed air to clear any debris /li /ul  I have tested the mic via phone call, facetime &amp; siri and these all work fine as expected.   Has anyone experienced this issue? The only remaining thing that I feel as though I can try is a factory restore which I'm trying to avoid.   Any suggestions would be helpful as I haven't found anything through apple support guides for this issue.   <answer285475> Under codeSettings/code  codePrivacy/code  codeMicrophone/code you'll be able to allow/deny each app that require the microphone to use it.   <comment360016> Just checking, did you mean `Privacy` instead of `Confidentiality`? I'm not aware of a Confidentiality option, although that may depend on your language/region. <comment360020> Yeah I think that's it (I said confidentiality because in French this menu is called "Confidentialit√©"). I edited the answer. <comment360026> Thanks for your suggestion, the apps are all enabled to use voice, I tried toggling the settings on and off also. <comment360027> Ok, and does the microphone work on Apple pre-installed apps **with and without** speaker mode? <comment360229> Interesting! So it appears to work when speaker mode is on but not when off. <comment360230> I don't know for sure about the iPhone 6, but in several iPhones, there is one mic for "classic" conversation (phone at your ear) at the bottom, and another _somewhere_ else because the first one would be too near the loudspeaker. <comment373762> I have this problem too! I hope you find an answer soon.
