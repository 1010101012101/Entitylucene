How can I initiate a modem connection from the command line? <body> I am looking for a way to initiate a PPP connection with my EVDO modem from the command line instead of having to go to System Preferences - Network and hit "Connect".  <answer23459> I'm sure there is a more elegant way, but this could be done with UI scripting. I don't have an EVDO modem, so I can't give the specifics of the script that would work, but first you would go to ï£¿ - System Preferences - Universal Access and make sure "Enable access for assistive devices" is checked.  Then, you could write a script using a text editor. As I said, the specifics of the script would depend on your system and the layout of the screen you're trying to control, but it would look something like this:     #!/usr/bin/osascript      tell application "System Preferences"      activate      set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.network"      click button 1      tell application "System Preferences" to quit   You'd save the script, make it executable, and then you could enable your modem from the command line. I'm sure there's a more elegant way that doesn't involve popping up a window and that doesn't involve so much trial and error at the "click button 1" stage, but this is a start.  <answer23475> I think this can be done using pppd. You'll need to find the device name (/dev/tty...) and read through the long list of available options but it looks like that could work.  <answer23691> To connect a network device, use the codeSystem Events/code dictionary:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell current location of network preferences         connect service "Sprint 3G"     end tell end tell /code/pre  assuming the name of the service is codeSprint 3G/code:  img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110831-cwhuqg7pais5e6tm88sdram69h.png" alt="Screenshot of Sprint 3G"  To disconnect, change codeconnect/code to codedisconnect/code:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell current location of network preferences         disconnect service "Sprint 3G"     end tell end tell /code/pre  Once you've saved your scripts with names, you can use the terminal codeopen/code command to kick off either script.  <comment26332> I would really like to find a way to do it without needing to actually open the System Preferences. <comment26335> Of course. As I said, my approach is distinctly inelegant, but still scriptable. I'd love to see a better answer, and I suspect something involving pppd is more likely to be viable, but I have less advice to offer on that front. <comment26381> You might be able to use two terminal windows to determine where your pppd script is stored. One window running `opensnoop`, the other `fs_usage` (without your modem, it's hard to guess where your scripts are stored) <comment26475> Well done! I hope you don't mind me adding an open command to finish this off in the terminal way. <comment26477> Looks great. I ended up using this with [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) so I could just type `connect 3g` or `disconnect 3g`. <comment26478> Here's what a screenshot of the Alfred integration looks like: https://img.skitch.com/20110831-pg1nht8jbnb46nwgx27saw2uxc.png <comment26513> How do you call Alfred from the command line? Perhaps you just meant to script it in response to a shortcut key. <comment26606> Yes, I just mean that I was able to use the script in response to a keyword in Alfred. <comment26642> alfred looks to be great - glad you have it - it might be a nice replacement for us old timers using FastScripts and storing scripts on the filesystem... <comment27302> I don't have a modem anymore to test this unfortunately, but I have used it in the past. (This is exactly what's used for [modem connections in linux](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5467), for example.) If this answer is "negatively helpful" I would appreciate learning why it was downvoted with a comment.
