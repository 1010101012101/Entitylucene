Launching Terminal app starts XQuartz <body> Whenever I start the Terminal app in OS X Lion, XQuartz starts automatically. Is this intentional?  I recently turned off much of the strongresume/strong functionality because too many things were starting without being called. Now, this is the only unexpected one.  <answer111500> Ouch!  It was indeed something in my .bashrc -- a call to xfontpath.  It got put in there when fink was installed, a mod to call all scripts in /sw/etc/profile.d  There, hidden in there, was the call.  Thanks for pushing me to find it.  <comment131103> Are you using `ssh` with `X11` forwarding? <comment131105> No.  That is, when I start Terminal, X comes up immediately, before I have a chance to start ssh.  Only bash is started at that point. (Once I start ssh, then yes.) <comment131110> What is in your .bashrc, .bash_profile etc?
