How can I remotely control an iPhone from a Mac? <body> I'm looking for a way to be able to remotely access an iPhone. I have moved fairly far from home for college, and would like to help my parents with various problems they have on their phones. It would be much easier if I could fix problems for them instead of trying to explain the solution. I would prefer to do it from a mac, but could also do it from another iPhone. I will not have physical access to the device for the foreseeable future.  I have already tried Apple Configurator and Jamf. Apple Configurator requires physical access to a device, and Jamf only allows editing certain settings (security, email, wifi, etc.). Any ideas would be a great help.  <answer294048> An iPad or iPod Touch and FaceTime is the best solution. Any old book or stand can prop the latter to show whatâ€™s on the former screen in real time to you.   Nothing else compares for ease of setup, quality and responsiveness.   <comment371228> Unfortunately there isn't a way to remotely control an iPhone from another device. Especially since your constraint is that you do not have physical access to the iPhone.
