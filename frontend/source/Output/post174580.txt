Mac mini fan replacement: amperage rating <body> I have a 2011 Mac mini server (quad-core i7, 2.0GHz) and the fan is going bad.    The current fan, part no. 610-0164 is rated 12V 0.66A.  The widely available replacement fans on eBay are rated 12V 0.5A.  They are marked as part no. 610-0069.  Does anyone have evidence that the replacement 0.5A fans are suitable for this computer, or should I try to find an exact replacement?  <answer174582> A Fan with 0.5Amp will do, since it will not overload the circuit, and only draw 0.5A while 0.66A is available.  It might not have enough power to provide sufficient air flow, thus it might run more, but that is only important if you run constantly at elevated Temperatures.  Check your mac mini model number to make sure it fits, since the one you are showing is for Mac Mini A1347 2010 2011 922-9953 610-0164 610-0069.
