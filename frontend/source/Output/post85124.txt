Set F7/F8/F9 to perform iTunes functions like built-in keyboard <body> I have a non-Apple keyboard connected to my MacBook Pro. Is there a way to make the kbdF7/kbd kbdF8/kbd and kbdF9/kbd do the previous song / play-pause / next song actions like they do on the built-in keyboard?  <answer85126> CoverSutra, among other things, will let you set your shortcuts the way you want it     h2Global Shortcuts/h2      Instantly control iTunes from anywhere, quickly and easily. Play, pause, rate, show, skip, rewind, fast forward... and much more! CoverSutra gives you complete control over your music with fully customizable keyboard shortcuts.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/77WL5.png" alt="CoverSutra shortcut preferences"  It's main feature (at least for me) is its Music Search. Its like Spotlight for iTunes. Activate it with a keyboard shortcut and search away!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZZuQI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment98092> I'm sure this works, but isn't there a simpler solution? I really just want the keyboard shortcut if possible...
