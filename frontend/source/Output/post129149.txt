Can I delete this recursive link to my Home directory? <body> My home directory has a symlink to my home directory. I'm not sure how it got there. Is it safe to delete?  precode~ steve$  ls -l steve lrwxr-xr-x  1 steve  staff  12 Jun 21  2012 steve -&gt; /Users/steve /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LDVFf.jpg" alt="Home directory in Finder"  <answer129150> strongYes./strong Providing you don't delete the contents of the symlink and just the symlink, you can delete the symlink fine. Just use ⌘⌫ on the symlink from Finder.  <answer129162> In command line you´ve more power with the following code line  precodecd ~ &amp;&amp; unlink steve /code/pre  so you´re shure that only the symlink will be deleted and not the complete home path :)  <answer129164> Simply running coderm ~/steve/code is safe:   ol lispecifying "~/steve"  (emnot/em "~/steve/", with a trailing slash) means coderm/code will work directly on the link and not follow it, as it would if you enter "~/steve/"./li lieven if you mistyped "~/steve/", deleting with coderm/code will not delete a directory unless you give it a "-r" option./li /ol
