Does Network Link Conditioner Work Well on El Capitan <body> I had Network Link Conditioner as part of xcode 6.1 package &amp; was working fine, I just upgraded my OSX to El Capitan, should I replace my NLC to that one found in xcode 7.3 or my existing NLC of Xcode 6.1 should still be performing fine?  <answer238467> strongYes/strong, It will perform as expected.  Bear in mind that the emNetwork Link Conditioner/em has noting to do with Xcode itself, but with the OS.   When downloading theses emHardware tools/em Apple points out that codethese graphics tools support running on [OS]/code which might lead you to think that and update is necessary, but the protocols and / or the way the emNLC/em interacts with the System's connectivity, doesn't seem to have changed, as it does, indeed, work.
