Get Automator to remount a partition for an attached hdd <body> I've got a setup where we backup our server every day to an external thunderbolt drive, and we alternate between two different drives.  I've got an Automator script that ejects the drive every week before it gets swapped.   After the new drive gets plugged in sometimes 1 of 2 partitions doesn't mount, I'd like to use Automator to check and remount the partition so that it's backups can take place.
