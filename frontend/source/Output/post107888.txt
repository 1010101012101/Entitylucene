How does Archiving a mail in Maill on an Exchange acccount work? <body> I'm running OS X Mavericks and have setup an Exchange acccount in Mail. I have tried hitting the Archive button on a mail message. That placed the mail message in the Archive on both the Mail app and in the Exhange account (outlook.office365.com/owa). I now have the following questions:  ul liWhy doesn't the mail appear in a Smart Mailbox in Mail.app?/li liHow do I see everything that is in the Archive in Mail.app?/li /ul  <comment129931> Seems to be a bug in Mail.app regarding smart mailboxes and Archive - fixed in Version 7.0 (1822). <comment129934> If there is still a question left, can you please revise your question accordingly and request a reopen? As there are no answers yet, there is no need to show the edit history as part of the question itself (it's still accessible anyway). <comment130043> @patrix The bug in the Mail.app was the reason for my confusion, so either that should be the focus of the question and answer, or the question could just be closed.
