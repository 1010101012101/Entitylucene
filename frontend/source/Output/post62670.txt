What is Logger.bundle? <body> I am running a late 2010 MacBook Air running OSX Mountain Lion with latest update.  Looking around in my system folders I found a file called Logger.bundle and it's in my code/System/Library/SystemConfiguration/code directory. The file logger.bundle was apparently created Monday, June 25th 2012 (so very recently). If I "view package contents" inside the code/Contents/MacOS/code directory is an executable called Logger.  Is this Logger.bundle some sort of trojan or something like that, or is it a normal part of the file system?  <answer62704> It's a normal part of OS X.  The name isn't very searchable, but you could copy the bundle identifier from the Info.plist. logger.c was the first result for com.apple.SystemConfiguration.Logger site:apple.com.
