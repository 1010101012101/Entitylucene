Numbers for Mac: Force line chart to show axis at point (0, 0) <body> Look at this line chart.  I wonder if its possible to force Numbers to show codeY=0/code, for example, without needing to add a data entry point to make it happen.  em- Is it possible?/em  <answer190041> In the inspector, one can set the Axis Scale to a minimum value.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2aPh.png" alt="Inspector Axis settings"  The resulting chart starts at 0 when minimum is set.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d2Omt.png" alt="Line Chart Y=0"
