Safari 8 Not Clearing Redirect Data <body> So this is a bit complex of a question. I have a domain, and I recently switched it from one host to another. Unfortunately, Safari doesn't realize that, and instead of loading the new server with data on it, it loads the default error page of the old one. It's not a hosting issue -- other browsers are working fine even on my computer.  So the question is this: where does Safari store this data, and how can I destroy it?  Edit: I have cleared Website Data in Preferences, History and Website Data in the Safari menu and Caches in the Develop menu.  <answer153531> A posible solution is to Reset DNS Cache.  You can do it with codedscacheutil -flushcache/code. For more info type codeman dscacheutil/code on the terminal.  <comment180697> I was in the same situation you were just a couple days ago, though clearing the caches through Develop  Empty Caches worked for me when you stated explicitly in your question you tried it and it failed to yield results. Odd. <comment325089> @MichaelCooke: Develop  Empty Caches worked for me just now. See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/227662/how-do-i-fully-flush-cached-redirects-from-safari
