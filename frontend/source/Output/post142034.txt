Which printer software driver should I use? <body> When adding a printer in OS X, and assuming the printer is AirPrint enabled, which driver should I use: 1. the AirPrint driver or 2. the CUPS driver for that specific printer?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DaA7P.png" alt="enter image description here"  My assumption is that while AirPrint is easy to use, it also must be generic enough to support a wide range of printers and a limited number of functions. Thus, while I can easily print with the AirPrint driver, I won't have access to all of the printer's functions and strongwould be better off using the CUPS driver/strong for that specific printer if I intend to print from that printer often or need more control over the printing process.  Anyone have documentation to support/refute my assumptions?  <answer142036> Doesn't matter. I've used both with an Epson multifunction printer/scanner and I have not lacked for any features with AirPrint.
