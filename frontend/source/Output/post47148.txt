Pages 08 doesn't draw border around paragraphs correctly? <body> If I'm using strongPages '08/strong and trying to draw a border around a paragraph that is inside a text box, I go to the emMore/em tab of the emText Inspector/em and select a solid line and full rectangle under emBorder and Rules/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDxE5.png" alt="enter image description here"  The border that results, however is a top-and-bottom border, and not a full rectangle:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvMym.png" alt="enter image description here"  Am I doing something wrong, or is this a known bug? If the latter, is there a workaround so I can enclose a paragraph of text in a text box with a surrounding border?  <answer47154> OK, this is a bit kludgy, but it seems to be working (but I'd love to see a better answer!):  Instead of applying a border to a paragraph, make each paragraph its own text box and apply a border to the entire text box using the emGraphic Inspector/em and setting strongStroke/strong to emLine/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zh90Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer47310> supDisclaimer: I'm using Pages '09, but I'm guessing the answer will be the same for '08./sup  You're seeing this because the left and right edges of the paragraph are not visible inside the text box. To work around this, you can add a small strongInset Margin/strong from the strongText/strong tab of the Text Inspector:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVvcx.png" alt=""  <answer186796> If you open a text box and click inside it as if you are writing in it, then choose style, border, line - you get a border all the way round.  <comment54053> I don't think  your answer is kludgy at all. The text box is the object, not the paragraph. <comment54055> The inspector pane implies one can add a border to a paragraph, independent of the border around the box containing the paragraph. <comment54058> @DanielL They're just different "border" definitions: one meaning is to separate a paragraph from the surrounding text; the other, to draw a line around the edge of a text box. Both do different things, and your answer uses it the way it's meant to be used! <comment54059> Though I do see how applying it paragraph-by-paragraph in a mass of text could count as a kludge. Yes.
