My Mac is constantly fetching 2MB/s from the network <body> We got our company macs, and I installed iStat menus on mine. What caught my eye is that there is a constant network traffic, ~2MB/s. Activity monitor also reports the same:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUlGV.png" alt="activity monitor"  However, the process list doesn't show anything excessive:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kNZYk.png" alt="list of processes"  The process with the most frequent change of rcvd packets is netbiosd, however it's received bytes show really small amounts.  Each Mac is a member of AD domain, and we all have Kaspersky running (I removed mine, but the traffic still remains).  After adding Little Snitch and enabling Show Local Network in it, I don't see excessive traffic in Little Snitch. It shows something like 0.2-1.5kB/s, which is what I would expect.  Any ideas what is happening here? Is there really 2MB/s traffic going in the machine, or is this a bug in Sierra?  <comment347139> Do you back up time machine to a network drive such as a Time Capsule or NAS? <comment347531> No, there is no Time Capsule, not NAS. Machine mounts two CIFS volumes, but the traffic remains even after I unmount them. <comment347817> So, what is happening is that there are ~2k multicast requests hitting the machine. That's why there is no process that's receiving it. Still find it buggy that it shows up on Activity monitor.
