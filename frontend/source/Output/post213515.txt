Can I make Apple Mail use "m" as the "mark unread" hotkey? <body> I'd like to make "m" the hotkey for marking emails unread, since that's the same key as every other email or RSS application uses, and command+shift+u is unwieldy. The only place I can find to set this is the global hotkeys and it won't let me use unmodified keys (presumably because that would break things). Is it possible to do this?  <answer213528> You can do the following:  ol liGo to emSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts/em/li liclick emApp Shortcuts/em and add a new shortcut using the "+" button/li liSelect emMail/em from the list of your applications/li liAs emMenu Title/em, you have to put the strongexact/strong name of the menu command you want to add. In your case, it should be "emAs unread/em"/li liChoose the shortcut you want/li liJust emAdd/em the modification/li /ol  After these steps, just restart Mail and it's done. You can check on the menu bar to see that the shortcut has been modified.  <comment257750> In Mail unmodified keys are used to jump to the first mail where the beginning of the Subject line matches the key pressed. <comment257769> Have you tried this yourself? You are not allowed to use unmodified keys in such shortcuts, as the asker has wanted. <comment257772> @NetherLinks Of course I tried, and it works for me. <comment257773> I cannot get the Shortcuts Panel to accept just "m" or "Shift-M". Please tell how you got that to work. <comment257774> Does not work for me with El Capitan, which OS X version are you using @MarcoGiordani? <comment257775> @NetherLinks Try to choose cmd + M instead, it should work for you too. Anyway, cmd+shift+u can be modified in this way for sure.
