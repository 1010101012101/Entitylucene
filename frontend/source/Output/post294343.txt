Can you whitelist certain words from being auto-corrected? <body> I'm aware you can turn off autocorrect entirely. However I feel like strongRick &amp; Morty/strong is popular enough to warrant its exclusion from being autocorrected to strongMarty/strong.  Is there any way to override/prevent auto-correct for specific words?  <answer294345> Generally, you can tap the little strong×/strong in the autocorrect bubble to block the autocorrect (or pick the left-most choice if using strongPredictive/strong). Do this enough times and iOS will learn your typing habits and stop trying to correct that word.  For a more permanent solution, you can also add that word into your systemwide custom dictionary.  On iOS, open strongSettings/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongText Replacement/strong → strong+/strongbr Under strongPhrase/strong enter codeMorty/code. Then either leave the strongShortcut/strong field blank, or enter codemorty/code in lowercase so the name gets capitalized automatically.  Note that these text replacements synchronize across your iOS and macOS devices over iCloud. However if you also want to add a word on macOS, it’s under strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongText/strong.  <comment371530> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic.  Who are "Rick and Morty", anyway? <comment371531> That works for now, but it'd be nice if it was native. <comment371532> @uwnojpjm See my edit. I've added a more permanent solution. <comment371533> Cool, thank you. <comment371534> Why are autocorrect issues being deemed "off-topic" - it's part of the supplied OS no? And Rick and Morty is a Sci Fi cartoon... <comment371536> The question as originally phrased was probably off-topic. However it reflected a valid use-case with a clear solution that could help many users. So I edited it to steer it back on topic. <comment371537> I find autocorrect annoying and leave it off, but as many find it useful and I like your answers.
