Apple Music play count stats <body> Is there a way to access play count or stats in general from an iPhone? Either Apple Music stats or local-content specific, doesn't necessarily matter, just can't seem to find anything like that.  <answer280394> Yes, you can see these details with a third party app  ul liGenre/li liRating/li liTrack #/li liComposer/li liLyrics/li liDate Added/li liLast Played/li liLast skipped/li liPlay Count/li liSkip Count/li /ul  hr  SmartPlaylist on the App Store  SmartPlaylist Website  As of today the app costs $2.99 (in the US App Store). I bought it for the Smart Playlist functionality that I grew accustomed to with my iPod mini/iPod classic.  To see the play count and other statistics follow these steps  ol liPlay your desired song in the Music.app/li liOpen SmartPlaylists.app/li liTap strongMenu/strong in the lower left/li liSelect strongNow Playing/strong/li liDouble-tapping a field like "Skipped" or "Released" will show you the time as well./li /ol  <comment352637> I don't think it's possible in the native music app (iphone or tablet). It does write that data, it just doesn't give you access to it. I use [Marvis](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id971737469), which [lets you view  the play count and some other meta data](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pkLST.png). In the picture you can't see, but above there is the song, artist and album information names. You can view edit the play count. You can't sort based on the play count. It can [filter songs based on play count or star rating](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aHigC.png) <comment352801> The sad thing about this app to me is that you can't save these as any kind of iTunes playlists. I still tend to make my smart playlists on the iTunes desktop app, as those work fairly well on mobile devices. ITunes smart playlists thst are live updating, require you to restart the app to refresh the playlist. Not so great, but I can live with that. SmartPlaylist app, I think works a bit better on mobile devices, but it is not a great music player.
