Mac Sierra, iCloud > Notes is greyed out <body> I recently updated to MacOS Sierra Version 10.12.2. In the emSystem Preferences  Internet Accounts  iCloud  Notes/em. The strongNotes application is emgreyed out/em/strong. It was working fine in El Capitan. Did someone face this issue? Thanks in advance.  <answer294617> I launched reminders and clicked reminders-add account from the menu.  I logged in with the same iTunes account that is already setup in System Preferences-Internet Accounts.  Reminders and System Preferences crashed, but then I could see reminders and notes selected in System Preferences-iCloud.  I can now see notes and reminders across my Mac and iPhone.  The options in System Preferences-iCloud are still greyed out.  <comment371864> Spent 45 minutes on the phone with Apple Support trying to fix this.  In the end they told me to try and re-install Sierra using recovery mode.  I did that, which doesn't wipe everything, and it still doesn't work.
