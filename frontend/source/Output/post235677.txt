mDNS not working <body> I re-installed my pfsense firewall the other day, sometime soon there after my macbook stopped doing backups using time machine.  The pfsense is installed on new hardware, but the config was restored from the old, so it should be the same as before.  The Time Machine target is a synology diskstation, which has worked fine for the at least the last 6 months.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBBO8.png" alt="Time Machine settings"  But connection attempts now just times out: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uX4FI.png" alt="Time Machine connection attempt" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ms281.png" alt="Time Machine error" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/20cRI.png" alt="Time Machine error message"  Connecting to the share manually also fails similarly: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6IrK.png" alt="Finder connect to server" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L9iOE.png" alt="Finder connection attempt" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/beKgj.png" alt="Finder connection error"  Samba using more traditional technology (normal dns) works fine: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/igKVC.png" alt="using normal dns" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDfev.png" alt="smb share list"  Normal name resolution and ping works fine: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KCi7g.png" alt="Normal ping successful"  But the code.local/code domain is not populating properly: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/563eR.png" alt="mdns ping fails"  I don't understand this multicast magic good enough to know where to even start troubleshooting. Any help is appreciated.  <answer235726> Rebooted the NAS, now it works.
