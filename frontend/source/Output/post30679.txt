Can a Non-Thunderbolt device (like a mid 2010 iMac) connect to a Thunderbolt Display? <body> I've been browsing different forums for this answer and the closest answer I could find was a post on this Stack Exchange.   However this post is still a 'may be' it won't work and it targets the general question 'Non Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt ?' which I would understand to be negative.  My question is more on the display side, since the thunderbolt technology carries both a display signal as well a pci express signal, can a non-thunderbolt diplay with a simple display port still carry that signal to a thunderbolt cinema display ?  Thanks for your knowledge on that matter.  <answer30682> No, it cannot. That's the reason Apple is still selling the non-thunderbolt 27" display, for the devices like yours.

Those displays are unfortunately getting scarce so people in the same situation will have to decide soon. <comment35265> Yes. I think it's an unfortunate decision for Apple because, will you decide to buy, say, a MBA, you will not be able to get all those additional ports. Of course the display will work, and you'll just have to buy one of those hopefully-out-soon Thunderbolt hub (gosh how much I want them) in that case, but still, Apple could have saved a lot of overhead to its supply chain and its customer. <comment35292> I've found something quite interesting. There is a company doing multi monitor signal splitting from one video input, [Matrox](http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go/?productTabs=1#specs) and they recently added a [Thunderbolt compatible device](http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/press/releases/2011/dualhead2go_dp/triplehead2go_dp/macbook_pro_thunderbolt/) acting as a Thunderbolt hub. Looks amazing...
