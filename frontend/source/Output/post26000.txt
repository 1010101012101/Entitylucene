Creating a wifi hotspot on OSX with a connected USB wifi adapter instead of airport (OSX Lion) <body> I am using a USB wifi adapter on my Lion imac.  I am trying to use that connection to create a working wifi hot spot with the imac's internal airport.   I tried following these instructions: http://maketecheasier.com/create-wifi-hotspot-using-mac-os-x/2009/10/20  It didn't work, though. It feels like i need to do one more step to get the connection bridged between the usb adapter and the airport.   Thanks, zeem  <answer26002> I think this will only work on wifi adaptors that support bridged mode wireless. Not all of them do. The internal Airport does which is why it can be turned into a hotspot.   I think you'll be able to go this way  precodeShare your connection from : [usb wifi adaptor]  To Computers using : [airport]  /code/pre  Setting up all security features as per normal.   <comment29703> seems like this is the answer, but it looks like the adapter doesn't support what's needed. thanks for the help.
