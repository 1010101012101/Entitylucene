Can I fit a 39Wh battery in my MacBook Air 2011 which states 35Wh? <body> I'm trying to change the battery in a MacBook Air 11â€³ i7 1.8 GHz (July 2011) MD214LL/A.  I found this Runpower battery, which is 39Wh.  Yet when checking the specs mentioned above, the battery is a 35Wh.  If I change the battery to one with a higher Wh, will it have a negative impact or will it be ok?br Can I safely buy and install the new battery?  <answer276103> The battery you want to buy should be fine (in terms of the specs and compatibility). The 39 watt hours basically means that on a full charge it emshould/em last longer than a 35 watt hour battery (about 11.4% longer). Many after market MacBook batteries do usually offer a little more capacity in that regard.  As for the battery itself, I've never used that particular brand, so cannot vouch for its quality. However, since it seems to have a 5 star rating, it looks promising. As long as it offers a decent warranty (I can't read French, so can't tell), I'd buy it.  <comment347471> You can just change the domain from amazon.fr to amazon.com for the English version.
