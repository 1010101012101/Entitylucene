MacBook Pro laggy even with free RAM and CPU <body> I have a MacBook Pro, 13-inch, mid-2012. With a (very) empty SSD as startup disk and 16 GB of RAM. Running on macOS Sierra (10.12.5).  So a week or so ago I started to notice that pop-ups were appearing on websites like google and Facebook. Clearly I had a malware, since this happened on Safari and Chrome. I also started to notice that my Mac is laggy/choppy, and so I thought that was caused by the malware, even though the pop us were infrequent. At the time I had Sophos installed and it never gave me a warning or anything, and I scanned the Mac with Sophos and with Malwarebytes multiple times but to no avail. None of them detected anything. I got frustrated, made a (manual) backup of the important files, and formatted the SSD and installed a fresh copy of macOS.  From the beginning, this time, the Mac was laggy, even though it's practically brand new and empty. The SSD is only a five months old and the RAM is about a year old (the Mac is 4 years old though). I did not know at all why that is. I have formatted and done fresh installs a few times in the past, and even back when I had an HDD and 8 GB of RAM, it was never laggy right after the install. So I did a full hardware check, the one where you press D when the system is booting. And I even selected "Perform extended testing", and nothing came back (all was okay). I also tried booting in safe mode but that did nothing.  Just to be clear, by laggy I mean, for example, when I drag an app from Launchpad to the Dock the screen freezes/lags for a split second. Or when I press the play/pause button there is a clear delay for the music to start/stop. Now even music sometimes pauses for a second because of the lag. It's still fast sometimes, but clearly way too laggy for a new install and that much RAM and SSD. It's not unusable, but the lag spikes are very irritating.  Can anyone suggest what's going on?  Thank you for taking the time to read and (if you do) reply.  (I posted the same exact question on Apple's discussion board, I hope that's not a problem)  <comment358239> Can you clarify two things please: (1) Since doing all of the above, do you still see the pop-ups that you were originally concerned about and wanted to stop? (2) In the top-right corner, where the Spotlight icon is (the magnifying glass), is there a dot inside the magnifying glass? <comment358241> @Monomeeth (1) No, definitely not. (2)It has finished indexing a while ago. I really only have 100GB of data. <comment358242> @Allan it was a fresh install. I did not restore from a back up or anything. The only thing I did was copy back my music and photo collection, which i copied manually to the hard drive as a back up. So no time machine or anything.  As for the new user thing, I will try that right now and get back to you on that. <comment358258> @Allan so Im now totally certain it's not a user account thing. <comment358271> Have you tried to reset the SMC? <comment358273> Yes I have, twice. And it didn't help unfortunately. <comment358276> @Allan as I have stated in the question, I did (extended testing even) and it came up with nothing. There seems to be no problem with the hardware. <comment358278> I'm not convinced it's not hardware.  I am assuming you have two 8GB sticks of memory, can you remove one and see if the problem goes away?  If not, swap out modules and test again. <comment358279> @Allan okay I will do that. <comment358283> @Allan I did as you said and I think there is more lag with one of the sticks than the other. What do I do in this case? <comment358286> Next is keep the suspect memory out and change the slot where the "good" memory is installed.  If the lag is still gone,  the problem is most likely memory.  After that, the next thing you should do is replace the suspect memory with a new module from a reputable manufacturer.  You will need a [PC3-12800 SODIMM](http://radnex.us/Crucial-PC-3-12800-SODIMM).  If the problem returns after changing the slot and a new module, then it's most likely the logic board. <comment358339> @Allan maybe this is not related, but yesterday the computer restarted abruptly and reset the date to 1/1/2017!!! However it did not give me the message that you're supposed to get when that happens. Like everything was normal except for the date. I thought this was due to the charger short circuit or something but I'm not so sure anymore.
