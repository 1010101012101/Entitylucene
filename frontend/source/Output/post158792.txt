Does iOS have a built-in RSS reader? <body> Do any iOS versions come with a built-in RSS reader?  <answer158794> Sort of... you can go into Safari, choose a website, then click the bookmark icon, select the strong@/strong tab, click Subscriptions and then click Add Current Site.   Otherwise Reeder for IOS is a great RSS reader. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-2/id697846300?ls=1&amp;mt=8  <answer158823> You could use strongReading List/strong on Safari. It's syncs automatically between all your iDevices. Reading List feature has been available on iOS since the launch of emiOS 7/em. Some apps like TweetBot allow you to directly send links to the Reading List which you can catch up later.  <comment186662> No, it haven't. The closest feature is Safari's Reading List.

Do you know which versions of iOS this comes with? <comment186668> This comes with iOS 8.
