Preview App Issue <body> I have the latest macOS version but today I noticed that on highlighting text in preview app, it lags for a milliseconds or less like what appears in the photo, I succeeded to take a fast screen shot during that lag. What could be the problem and how to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7KXk9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment333786> It could just be loading the document. Question 1) Does the document load correctly? 2) Does it impede your work or just look annoying for a split second? If you answer yes to question 1 and choose the second option for question 2, I wouldn't worry about it. <comment333875> @NoahL The document does load correctly and it does not impede my work but, this has only happened since I updated from 10.12.1 to 10.12.2 it was not like this before, It is very irritative to me. Is there any solutions or should I wait for a new update? <comment333876> Does it happen on every document? <comment333976> Yes, in all documents, even those created by pages !
