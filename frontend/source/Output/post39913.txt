What's the safest, cleanest way to jailbreak my iPad 1? <body> What's the safest, cleanest way to jailbreak my ipad1?  I'm running iOS 5 I believe.  <answer39937> I haven't used it myself, but this came to light after a quick Google search. Looking deeper it appears that this is the only untethered jailbreak available for A4 devices that doesn't first require a tethered jailbreak.  Good luck.  <answer40179> I'd recommend redsn0w. It's what I used. It's not hard to do, plus it has a lot of other tools in it that can help if you mess up. The link to the official download and a quick tutorial can be found here. You'll need to upgrade to iOS 5.0.1 beforehand.  <comment61230> Please choose an answer, for it's been a few months. <comment61261> @Andrew Larsson I tried your answer and it broke Safari and the app store, so I just stopped bothering. Oh well I only ever use the ipad as an ereader/video machine anyway <comment98554> Have you tried Googling this?Redsn0w works fine for ipad one. And mark that answer as answer please.
