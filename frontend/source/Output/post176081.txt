Macbook Pro Airport card problem <body> I have a problem with the wifi a while ago, so I deleted the Airport connection and am unable to find means to reinstall it. The system now shows no airport card installed. I am using 10.6.8, no further updates available on my MBP.  I have tried using terminal command to detect new hardware, and also reset the NVRAM and SMC following procedures on this forum to no avail. My last resort was to try to boot from the OS Install CD (10.5.7) by holding the C key during power on, but the screen appeared with a message in 4 languages that I need to restart my computer by holding the power button a few seconds, and it just going through the same again.  How should I boot from the CD to get to the network option to install the airport?  Thanks in advance!  <comment207796> Could you post a screenshot of what you see in the Network System Preference when you try to add the WiFi connection back? <comment207816> how do I post image here?
