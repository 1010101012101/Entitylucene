How to set a specific email address in Automator, from a variable? <body> I can collect a variable (email address) from the clipboard. How do I set it to the recipient in Mail with Automator?  <answer104102> Unfortunately, the New Mail Message action only uses variables in the Subject text field, so instead you would need to use something like another Run AppleScript action to create your new message.  Something like:  precodeon run {input, parameters}              set theFile to item 1 of input            set theRecipient to item 2 of input              tell application "Mail"      set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:"My Subject"}      tell content of theMessage        make new attachment with properties {file name:theFile} at after last paragraph      end tell      tell theMessage        make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:theRecipient}      end tell            end tell  end run /code/pre
