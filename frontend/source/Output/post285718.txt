El Capitan temporarily unavailable <body> I have wiped my wife's HD in preparation for selling her 2 hear old MacBook Pro. I am trying to reinstall El Capitan using my Apple ID and I keep getting a message that El Capitan is temporarily unavailable. I have tried my daughters ID as well and get the same message. Each time, we have been sent a password to our iPhones which we have entered on the MacBook to authenticate us.  <comment360526> Probably because El Capitan is outdated <comment361549> Have you tried contacting Apple Support as they are the only ones who can address issues with their ESD system?
