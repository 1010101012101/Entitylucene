How do I reset a locked Apple Watch in Airplane Mode? <body> Through a series of events the passcode entries on an Apple Watch has been exhausted and the watch is locked with this message:     Wrong Passcode      Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, go to   Passcode, then tap Re-enable Passcode Entry to try again.   But when I go to Passcode on the Apple Watch app it just spins probably because the watch is in Airplane Mode.  When I try to reset the watch through the Apple Watch app I get this error message:     Could Not Connect to Apple Watch      Make sure your Apple Watch is nearby, powered on, and not in Airplane   Mode.   But I can't turn off Airplane mode on the watch because it locked. Do I have any other options besides taking to the Apple store with proof of purchase?  <answer228191> Looks like there is a way to erase a locked Apple Watch.  ol liHold down the side button to see the options to power off the watch./li liForce touch/li liSelect 'Erase all content and settings'/li /ol  I discovered you can force touch on the power off screen from this site: http://www.barryschiffer.com/how-to-recover-an-apple-watch-stuck-in-a-crash-reboot-loop/  Official link - https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204567  <comment278241> Are you sure?
