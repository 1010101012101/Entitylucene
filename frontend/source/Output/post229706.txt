Delete photos from Desktop <body> I exported a large number of photos by mistake from the photos application to my desktop.  How do I delete these photos?   <answer229709> There are a lot of possibilities.   Firstly, you can try to press the undo keys: codecmd + z/code (this probably will not work).  Otherwise you can try to use the Terminal, in the particular case you don't want to delete photos one by one. From the Terminal if you can run the following command: coderm ~/Desktop/*.extension/code where extension stands for the extension of your pics. So for example if all the photos are JPEG you can run: coderm ~/Desktop/*.jpg/code.  Please note that the use of this command will delete strongall/strong the files in the desktop with the code.jpg/code extension. So if you have even only one photo that you want to save from the desktop, you can't sue this tool.  <answer229717> ol liOpen a finder window and go to the desktop/li lichange to list view/li lisort by type, so you can see just the jpegs/li lihighlight/delete all jpegs/li /ol  <comment280252> To avoid making a mistake with the `cd` command that could lead to unintended data loss, you could type `rm ~/Desktop/*.jpg` to explicitly specify the path. (The `-r` flag in Mattia's second `rm` command is incorrect as it must be used with the `-d` flag, denoting `rm` operations to _directories_ and the contents therein.) <comment280257> I applied your suggested edit @IconDaemon. Thanks.
