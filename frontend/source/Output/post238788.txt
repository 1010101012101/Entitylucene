Screen saver starts immediately after login <body> I have a few accounts on my MBP.  On one of them only as soon as I login the screen saver starts and then I am basically kicked backed to the login window (I had set for immediate lock).  If I login the second time the screen saver does not activate.  Am I missing a setting here or something?  <comment292905> Did the behaviour start after installing a certain app? <comment292909> Not that I can recall. I can't really say when this started. It's just the one account which is weird. <comment292913> Administrator account or standard account? What happens when you set the lock to 5 seconds/deactivate it? <comment292917> The 5 seconds seems to work.  I may set it back to see if it returns or perhaps clears it.  I even waited 5 seconds to see if the screen saver was getting launched but it didn't.
