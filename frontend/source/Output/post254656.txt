re-enable mouse scroll inertia in Sierra <body> In previous versions of macOS (OSX), when I scrolled fast, the page woule keep sliding a bit, as if there was some inertia keeping it moving. This seems to have been disabled in Sierra, and I can't find the setting to re-enable it.  <answer254659> I found the setting in System Preferences  Accessibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  Trackpad Options.  It was enabled, and disabling it and re-enabling fixed the issue for me. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwam2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment317032> See [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/254532/88313).  There's a lot of mouse issues on Sierra. <comment317034> Hey, thanks for the link. I've found the issue, but I'll bookmark that in case anything else comes up. <comment369996> The option for the mouse has been removed though.
