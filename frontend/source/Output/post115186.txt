How to move Mail data to an SD card? <body> I have MBA 128 GB, and my local Mail cache is too large to be stored on the HD.  Now, I have the external 16 GB SD card plugged in via compact Nifty adapter.  It's always mounted.  How can I set up the Mail app to store its data on that SD?  <answer115188> Mailboxes are stored in ~/Library/Mail.
