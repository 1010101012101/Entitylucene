Long pause on focus changes after Sierra update <body> After updating to Sierra, I'm experiencing a strange performance issue:  When I change keyboard focus (with in an app, or between apps) there is a long (3-4 seconds) pause/freeze of inactivity before I can resume user input.  For example:br Suppose I'm in a browser (this occurs regardless of browser used), and I click in the URL field, I now have to wait 4 seconds with a frozen computer for focus to switch to the URL field. I then click a text area on a page, I now have to wait 4 seconds for the text field to get focus. I click on another app, I have to wait 4 seconds for that app to get keyboard focus. I click on a system menu, I have to wait 4 seconds. Etc...  Some strange notes:  ol liRandomly, this effect comes and goes with no intervention. I don't need to restart, enable, disable anything for this effect to come &amp; go./li liThere are no CPU spikes. CPU is not maxed./li liOther signs of performance are not affected (e.g. page scrolling, animations, etc.)/li /ol  I've had trouble knowing what to look for or where to start. Any suggestions are appreciated.
