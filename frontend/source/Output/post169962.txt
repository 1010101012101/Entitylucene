Transferring iPhoto movies into iMovie <body> I have transferred iPhoto movies into iMovie by first copying them to a folder on desktop, trimming them and then importing into iMovie.  Now, however, if I move that newly created folder of movies on the desktop to the trash, it then deletes them in IPhoto (replacing with a question mark).  Am I required to always keep that folder of movies somewhere in order for them to be accessible in iPhoto moving forward?  <comment199726> iPhoto movies automatically show up in iMovies your just creating more work for yourself. What version of both apps are your running.
