Dropbox context menu and TotalFinder failure <body> few months I'm struggling with strange behaviour two of my Apps. TotalFinder and Dropbox. Issue is combined with Dropbox menu available on right-mouse-click. When I start computer with Dropbox and TotalFinder menu is appear for some time. After I don't know what is gone. I'v asked Dropbox Support about that and TotalFinder Support as well. No solution till now. Maybe someone from you had similar issue or know how to solve it.  TotalFinder 1.7.10 and 1.7.12 Dropbox 3.14.7  Below part of Console Log from computer starts till I noticed issue again.  I hope is someone who can help.  link to console log  <answer228729> I have the same problem with XtraFinder (a similar but free Finder replacement). My only work around so far has been to "logout" under the Apple menu, then login and there is the Dropbox choices in the right (or control) click contextual menu again.  Logout &amp; login is faster than restarting, tho still inconvenient.   I hope you find a better solution and post it here.  <answer229850> I get XtraFinder and for now it happened 3 times. Quit Dropbox and restart Finder is enough for now. Still I haven't idea about the reason of this issue.
