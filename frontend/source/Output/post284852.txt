Supported USB-C Alternate Modes on MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) <body> I am curious exactly what USB Type-C alternate modes (and variations of those modes) are supported on the MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016). I've done some searching on the internet, but I've been unable to find any credible source of information on the subject. I would consider a credible source of information to be:  ul liOfficial Apple technical documentation explicitly describing all supported USB Type-C alternate modes which are supported on the device. (All I've found so far is marketing info, which isn't specific enough)/li liAnalysis of USB PD traffic which might indicate supported alternate modes and capabilities./li liSome sort of command-line utility or tool which is able to dump this information./li /ul  I already know that the USB Type-C ports on this machine support the following alternate mode configurations:  ul li4 lanes using Thunderbolt 3.0/li li4 lanes using DisplayPort 1.2/li li2 lanes using DisplayPort 1.2 and 2 lanes using USB 3.1/li /ul  But I'm pretty sure it supports additional variations.  <comment359415> Apple is notoriously closed. You probably need a developer account to even begin to delve into their systems on such a technical level.  Furthermore SIP has made it more difficult to spy on the kernel.
