Can't connect to TimeCapsule Wifi network from Ubuntu <body> I don't know if this is the right place to ask this question, but I can't find my TimeCapsule Wifi network from a Ubuntu machine I want to share some files with. The name of the connection simply doesn't show up among the available networks. Any help appreciated.  <answer55527> On strongOMG Ubuntu/strong is a blog post about how to set this up. I myself have been using this solution in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 64-bit.
