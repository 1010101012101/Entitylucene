Move similarly named images into a folder with the same name <body> I am trying to create an automator app which will take all the images which are similarly named and create a folder with that name and move the images then into that folder and then archive that folder.   Thus turing the following into three folders:brbr Some long or short name depending on what it was named by whomever 001.jpgbr Some long or short name depending on what it was named by whomever 002.jpgbr Some long or short name depending on what it was named by whomever 003.jpgbr Some long or short name depending on what it was named by whomever 004.jpgbr Short image name 001.jpgbr Short image name 002.jpgbr Short image name 003.jpgbr Short image name 004.jpgbr Short image name 005.jpgbr Short image name 006.jpgbr Short image name 007.jpgbr Short image name 008.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 001.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 002.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 003.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 004.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 005.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 006.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 007.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 008.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 009.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 010.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 011.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 012.jpgbr My Mom named this one - it's her parrot 013.jpgbr  would become:brbr Some long or short name depending on what it was named by whomever.zipbr Short image name.zipbr My Mom named this one - it's her parro.zipbr  <answer139117> After you launched "Automator" and created a workflow:  ol liSelect "Files And Folders" at "Actions"./li liDouble click on "Find Finder Items" and setup what and where to find your files. Which means: select the folder where the first group of pictures are stored. And enter the search condition (Name contains "whomever")./li liRun the workflow to see the result - you should see what you expect. Which means: you should see all the files containing "whomever"./li liDouble click on "Create Archive" and setup how to name the archive and where to save it./li liAdd step 2 and 4 for the other 2 file name groups./li liRun the workflow./li /ol  But I can not see why you need the "Automator" for this. You could do all this very easy in the Finder:  ol liSelect the files of the first group: click on the first file of one group (named "whomever..."), hold down the "shift" key and click on the last file of the first group./li liSelect "Compress" in the File menu of the Finder. You will get an archive named "Archive.zip". Rename it to "whomever.zip"./li liProceed with step 1./li /ol  It might help to set the "View" of the Finder to "List".
