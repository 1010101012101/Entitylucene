How to I list applications sorted by modified time in Finder on OS X 10.8? <body> I discovered that on 10.8 the Applications folder does not allow you to change the sort order, it's always listed by name.  How can I change the sort order?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uo31A.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer61679> On the top of the Finder window, you have a set of buttons called View. Right beside that is a button called Arrange with a drop down arrow. Click the arrow and you can arrange however you want: by name, date, etc.  <answer61762> The view your screenshot displays can be produced if you go to the strongView/strong menu and select strongArrange by ▸ Name/strong (or press kbd^/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd1/kbd). When "Arrange by Name" is selected, indeed changing the sort order is not possible. If, however, you select strongView/strong then strongArrange by ▸ None/strong or press kbd^/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd0/kbd, your problem is solved.  <answer61763> Go to View Menu  Arrange By  None. That will make the columns editable. You can sort by whatever criteria you want now.  <comment71160> That’s strange… I can change the sort order in my Applications folder. Is the name column header highlighted with blue? <comment71321> @DeepanshuUtkarsh I added a screenshot. <comment157106> none of these options worked for me. I can arrange folders opened independently but if I am trying to place or open a file the menu is still unusable. I also do not have an "Arrange By" item, it is "Sort by" and it doesn't work for opening/placing files. Any other ideas?
