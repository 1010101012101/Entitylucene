Any Pdfinfo -terminal tool in OS X? <body> I am trying to find any default tool in OS X by which you can see in Terminal the encodinf of a pdf file.   You can do this visually by clicking info on the file.   For instance, such files which have emMac OS X 10.10.2 Quartz PDFContext/em I want to get out of my System. So my task is actually find those files and then find original ones and convert them correctly to right encoding via LaTeX.   h2Outputs of the commands in answers/h2  Command codemdls/code in fd0's answer  precodemdls -name kMDItemEncodingApplications -raw OxfordDictionary.pdf  /code/pre  gives   precode(     "3-Heights(TM) PDF Producer 2.0.5.0 (http://www.pdf-tools.com); modified using iTextSharp 5.0.0 (c) 1T3XT BVBA" /code/pre  Installation of codebrew install Caskroom/cask/pdfinfo/code wants sudo so I had to reject it in my current settings. The codemdls/code seems to work sufficiently.  hr  How can you see the encoding of pdf-file in OS X Terminal?  <answer171175> The tool you mention codepdfinfo/code is available on OS X, for example by installing MacPorts and then  precodesudo port install pdfinfo /code/pre  About the second part of your question: codeMac OS X 10.10.2 Quartz PDFContext/code is not an encoding but the emproducer/em.  To extract it with codepdfinfo/code:  precodepdfinfo file.pdf | grep ^Producer /code/pre  <answer171178> Just get Xpdf 3.04 from foolabs.  If your current system is Yosemite get the precompiled binaries: xpdfbin-mac-3.04. The 64-bit installer available there doesn't work. Uncompress/Untar the tar.gz and install this binary package manually:  ol liCopy the 64-bit executables (xpdf, pdftotext, etc.) to to /usr/local/bin./li liCopy the man pages (*.1 and *.5) to /usr/local/man/man1 and /usr/local/man/man5./li liCopy the sample-xpdfrc file to /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc.  You'll probably want to edit its contents (as distributed, everything is commented out) -- see xpdfrc(5) for details./li /ol  Check your $PATH if the executables don't work.  If your current system is Mavericks, Mountain Lion or Lion the above-mentioned 64-bit installer should work.  Now continue like Matteo mentioned:  To extract it with codepdfinfo/code:  precodepdfinfo file.pdf | grep ^Producer /code/pre  <answer227575> If you want to install it using mac ports, you should install the package xpdf OR xpdf-tools, for example:  precodesudo port install xpdf-tools /code/pre  and then extract the information you need:  precodepdfinfo file.pdf | grep ^Producer /code/pre  <answer227586> You can use codemdls/code instead of installing external tools.  precodemdls -name kMDItemEncodingApplications -raw file.pdf /code/pre  <comment201376> It would be great if this can be done without external tools. Just with standard tools. <comment201377> But you mentioned `pdfinfo` yourself... Anyway I don't think that OS X has some similar by default (either by using `string` and `grep` ...) <comment270854> Installed MacPorts - Error: Port pdfinfo not found <comment277424> Great! Than you for pointing this out. The installation of pdinfo requires sude which does not make sense. I had to reject it in my current setting. I added an example output of your command in the body of the question. Your command seems to work sufficiently. <comment277425> You need `brew install Caskroom/cask/pdfinfo` in El Capitan.
