Is tree view available in Finder in Lion? <body> I've seen on several forums that people use a tree view for their folders in Finder but I can't find anywhere how to switch to it.  Is the tree view available in OSX Lion?  <answer100761> The way emitems/em are shown in Finder can be configured through the folder's Toolbar, which gives four emdefault/em options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QsNGj.png" alt="Finder&#39;s displaying options"   ul listrongIcon View/strong - Which is the regular layout of icons. /li listrongList View/strong - The items are shown in a list-like and can be navigated as a strongtree/strong./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dpdFR.png" alt="The List View"  ul listrongColumns View/strong - Items are displayed through columns which show the file's path./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xeWfc.png" alt="The Columns View"  ul listrongCoverFlow/strong - Items are shown with the regular emcoverflow/em efect./li /ul  strongNote:/strong While in a folder, you can switch through these options by doing kbdCommand/kbd + the option's number (strong1/strong is the icon's view, strong2/strong is the list view, etc).  <comment136400> **Important**: The list view only shows the tree if *Arrange* has no criteria selected
