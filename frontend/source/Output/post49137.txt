What does this Safari-related "system.log" message mean? <body> I keep seeing these log messages in my "system.log" on my OS X 10.5 machine.  Within 1 to 12 minutes after connecting to my ISP I see these messages appear:  Jan  1 11:20:11 206 Safari[105]: Safari Major build: 528  Jan  1 11:35:15 206 Safari[105]: Safari Major build: 528  They seem to occur 1 to 3 times per day. I have no idea why. I do use Safari as my main browser. I thought they represented me launching the Safari app, but they don't.   They don't seem to be causing any problems with my machine but I am just trying to get a better understanding of why they occur. I've tried scouring the Internet with Google searches and can't seem to find anyone else with the same occurances.  What would make these system.log messages occur?  Thanks in advance.
