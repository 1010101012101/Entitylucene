How to change the move / calorie Activity goal on an Apple Watch? <body> I've recently set up a new Apple Watch; during the setup process I selected the "most active" setting (emVery Active/em, I think).  Now that I've seen the daily targets in the Activity app, I realise that the move/caloria goal (red ring) is too high.  Can I change that?  I've looked in a bunch of places, including the general emSettings/em, emHealth/em settings, and emActivity/em settings (all in the emWatch/em app on the iPhone) - and the emActivity/em app on the iPhone. But no luck.  Additionally, can the three goals be changed independently?  <answer246091> The option is hidden behind a long/hard press - so not easily discoverable:  ul liTap on the Activity app from your Apple Watch's Home screen./li liSwipe left until you see the Move ring./li liPress firmly on the screen./li liTap on Change Move Goal./li liAdjust your move goal to whatever you'd like and tap Update./li /ul  Source: How to set a calorie goal with Activity for Apple Watch  The calorie goal is the only configurable goal.  <comment303349> Actually, it turns out you can do the firm press on any of the screens in the Activity app, not just the one showing the Move ring.
