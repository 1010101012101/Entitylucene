How can I troubleshoot issues with saving files to a Windows server? <body> Greetings from Server Fault!  We are a mixed PC/Mac environment.  Recently at least one user has been having problems saving files to one of our Windows server shares.  The issue at hand occurs when the user is attempting to edit existing Word documents.  The user opens a file from the Windows server share using Finder.  They make a change to the file, then attempt to save the file by going to File, then Save.  After doing this, even though the file is an existing file, the Save As window appears.  If she tries to click save to save over the existing file, it prompts her with a message asking if she wants to overwrite.  If she responds yes, the Save As window goes away and then reappears.  There are no error messages displayed.  In order to save the changes to the file, the user has to save the opened file to her local drive, rename it, then copy the file onto the share.  We have seemingly checked everything we can think of from a server, account and permissions perspective.  There are hundreds of Windows users using this share all day, every day without any problems.  Additionally, we have not received reports of other Mac users having this problem, however, the user in question believes that others have experienced the issue.  My question is, what are some ways to troubleshoot this type of issue from the client's perspective?  On Windows, I could use a tool like Process Monitor to potentially determine where the process is having issues saving.  Is there a similar tool for OS X?  Are there logs that would be helpful?  Environment:  ul liServer 2012 Standard /li liOS X 10.11.3/li liOffice 15.20 (160315)/li /ul  Thanks!  <comment287067> Does this issue occurs with all files regardless of the application making the edit and save, or just Word? <comment287068> So far it is just Word.  I have not been able to reproduce the issue with Excel, Powerpoint or TextEdit. <comment287070> What is the file serving protocol? Are you connecting with SMB, AFP? <comment287071> This is an SMB share on a Windows 2012 server.  Is there a way to setup an AFP share without a third party tool? <comment287072> If you setup another Account on the same Mac that is having an issue when using Word, does the other account experience the same issue? <comment287073> I can't answer that at the moment. <comment287074> Other than the standard ways of troubleshooting an issue like this, such as narrowing down the software that is affected, and whether it happens on another computer, or with another account, what tools are available on OS X to assist? <comment287095> try connecting to the server from OSX using cifs:// instead of smb:// -- and see what happens. cifs:// uses the older SMB version. Apple has decided to implement later versions of SMB itself, and I've found that going back to the older version clears up a lot of issues.
