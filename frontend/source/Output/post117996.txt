MacPro Hard Drive 3 TB or Larger formatted to Logical Volume Group by Disk Utility <body> I have an Intel MacPro in which I recently installed a new internal 3TB hard disk.  I attempted to format it in Disk Utility using the standard GUID partition map and encountered a strange problem. strongDisk Utility formatted it using a emLogical Volume Group (LVG)/em instead of GUID./strong  Furthermore, Disk Utility subsequently refused to allow me to reformat or repartition this drive. The emPartition Layout/em drop-down in Disk Utility is greyed-out. I seem to be stuck with a LVG drive.  h3Specifics/h3     Model: MacPro Quad Core (Early 2009/Nehalem MacPro4,1)br   System: OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5br   Disk Utility: Version 13 (450)br   Hard Disk: Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001 3TB   emHow can I remove the Logical Volume Group partition scheme and reformat this drive in the GUID standard recommend by Apple?/em  <answer118008> This problem has been reported to occur on Intel MacPro's using internal drives from various manufactures with capacities = 3 TB. Specifically, it's been reported when using emDisk Utility/em in OS X emMountain Lion (10.8)/em and emMavericks (10.9)./em  Although there have been solutions involving using emdiskutil/em in emTerminal/em posted here at AskDifferent and elsewhere on the web, I found a simpler solution: Format the disk using emDisk Utility/em from an strongOS X Snow Leopard (10.6) Install DVD./strong  hr  h3Warning: This solution emwill/em cause you to lose all data on the drive./h3  ol liBackup any valuable data from the drive in question./li liReboot using the OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) Install DVD.

(If you need to repartition or reformat the drive in the future, you will need to repeat this process. Hopefully Apple will fix this bug in a later version of emDisk Utility./em)  <comment149092> The only issue I have when doing this is that I can no longer create a bootcamp partition. When I let OS X (10.8) reformat using a logical volume, I have no issues using bootcamp assistant. Only issue is that i have a waisted 800gig logical volume and can no longer create a data partition. If i use the method above and let OS X (10.6) reformat, it lets me using the GUID partition scheme, but when I go to run Boot Camp Assistant, i get the "The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition"... even though it shows I currently have 1 3TB Macintosh HD partition created with <comment149141> @g8orballboy I have not used Boot Camp Assistant with this scenario. Are you using Boot Camp Assistant 10.6, or a later version?
