More than 100 GB disappeared on MacBook Pro 250GB SSD <body> I was installing a software on the MacBook Pro of my girlfriend when I have found that in "ï£¿  About this Mac  Storage", it says that she have 134 GB of space used by "Applications"...  I have then looked at what she installed, and I see that the only apps she installed are Caffeine, Kindle, VLC, Google Chrome and Skype (along with the default applications of OS X).  I've downloaded Disk Inventory X to see what's happening, and it says that the Applications are taking up about 9GB.  The question then is... Where are all these gigabytes gone?  PS: Using the "Disk Utility" app, it says that 130 GB are used by Applications, but it also says that there are 202 GB of free space... I wonder how this can be possible since the SSD is just 250 GB...  <answer227606> I suggest you to use the DaisyDisk application (a free trial is also available).  This app help you to find out how you are using the space available and so you can identify what is occupying a large amount of space in your HD.  <answer227609> Maybe, the Spotlight is not indexing correctly any more.  Open the System Preferences  Spotlight/Privacy and drag the Macintosh HD icon to the window. Click OK. Choose the icon and and click the - sign to remove it, so that the reindexing routine starts. Test when completed.   <answer227624> Download an application called OmniDiskSweeper to see how the storage is being used. That should give a breakdown of all the files and locations.   <comment277437> Where do you find the "Informations about this Mac  Archive"? <comment277439> Sorry, I mean "Apple  About this Mac  Storage" <comment277447> I've already tried it, I'm not sure how to know when the procedure is finished tho... <comment277448> It has the same purpose of Disk Inventory X (which is free), I have already found that nothing is taking up all that space... I just wonder why OS X thinks so... <comment277450> The procedure might take some time, depending on the volume of your system. If you use any "antivirus" scanner just remove it. Furthermore run the terminal command diskutil verifyvolume / to see if there are any errors in the disk. <comment277451> Ah, it's fixed now! I guess it's thanks to the re-index procedure then. <comment277579> I've already said that I've used Disk Inventory X, I don't see how suggesting an app that does the exact same task can help.
