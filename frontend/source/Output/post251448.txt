Space with Hiragana Input <body> For whatever reason Memrise requires you to input a space character in some Japanese answers (I'm very much a beginner, so this may not be as weird as I think). However when I have my input set to codeHiragana/code with codeRomaji/code typing method, pressing kbdspace/kbd converts what I've already typed into Kanji even though I have codeLive Conversion/code disabled (I think that's what it's doing, they're not Kanji I recognize but I don't know what else they might be). Obviously this is very annoying as I keep getting answers wrong when all I'm missing is a space or I'll have random Kanji in the middle of what I'm typing.  <answer251449> It turns out that holding kbdshift/kbd while pressing kbdspace/kbd will input a normal space character if you have the codeShift key action/code set to codeEnter Romaji mode/code.
