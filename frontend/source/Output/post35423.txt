OS X Lion - How to configure website on Apache <body> I'm on my first steps with OS X and I'm trying to setup Apache so I can develop a website. I configured a new alias on /etc/apache2/other with the following content, pointing to my project folder, like this:  precodeAlias /mySite /Users/me/Documents/workspace/mySite    &lt;Directory /Users/me/Documents/workspace/mySite&gt;   Options Indexes        Order allow,deny   Allow from all  &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  However, accessing to localhost/mySite gives me a 403 forbidden. I have access to localhost (which I realize has its web folder at /Library/WebServer/Documents) and I have access to localhost/~me (which shows the content of ~/Sites). I also tried to deploy my site in that folders and I can have access to it, but my ideia was, at most (if configuring the site on Apache fails), to use a symbolic link there pointing to the real project location, but right now I'm also getting the same 403 with it. Can someone help me with this?  Thanks!  <answer35437> Perhaps   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks  and   DocumentRoot /Users/me/Documents/workspace/mySite  would be useful?  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html (See &lt; Directory  Directive)  <answer35447> The default permissions on ~/Documents don't allow anyone but the owner access to it. Apache accesses the documents as the _www user, so if that user can't get to the web folder, you'll get a permissions error.  If this is the problem, there are a couple of possible solutions: you can either move the project folder outside of ~/Documents (e.g. /Users/me/workspace/mySite), or change the permissions on ~/Documents to allow Apache in (codechmod +a "user:_www allow search" ~/Documents/code should do the trick).  <comment40400> So, you mean _www user can't access `/Users/me/Documents`, but it can access `/Users/me`? I assume ~/Sites has the same permissions that ~/Documents correct, and that is the reason why it's not working? <comment40425> The default permissions on ~, ~/Sites, and ~/Public allow everyone read access; all of the other default folders under ~ (~/Documents, ~/Library, ~/Desktop, etc) are locked down so only the owner has any access.  When you create new folders and documents, they default to being readable by everyone *unless* you put them in a protected location (like ~/Documents).
