Trouble installing Xquartz on Mountain Lion <body> I am trying to install Xquartz on Mac OS X 10.8.5 but it freezes at the Select Destination part of install. The only choice (make available for all users on the computer) is grayed out as well as the 'continue' button.  No amount of waiting or clicking lets me get past this point.  I have seen this issue brought up in a previous thread (Problem in installing X11/XQuartz in Mac 10.8.5).  However the only real solution offered was to upgrade to 10.9 (which may no longer be offered for free on the Apple App store).  I have tried multiple versions of Xquartz that are supposed to be compatible with Mountain Lion but have the same issue during installation.  Is there a solution that does NOT require an OS X upgrade?  I have softwares installed that may not be compatible with newer operating systems (and a key program that is definitely not compatible with the newest operating system Sierra).
