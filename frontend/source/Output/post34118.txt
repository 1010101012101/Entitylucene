Is there a URL scheme for sending an SMS to multi-recipients? <body> I just got quickpick from the app store, and of course I have it doing my basic call this person (tel://A), text this person(sms://B), but I would like to know, is there a URL scheme for SMS with multiple recipients? I've tried mms://A+B but it doesn't recognize mms:// as a command.  Any thoughts?  <answer34128> If codesms:///code launches Messages (and it does), then you don't need an codemms:///code handler, because codesms:///code launches Messages but doesn't determine the message type. Simply tap the camera icon and choose the photo to send once Messages launches.  Protocol handlers like codetel:///code and codesms:///code are just glorified urls, like http://www.askdifferent.com/, and they were not designed with multiple resources in mind. Resources being domains, files, etc. Note that you cannot request two files from within a single URL.  Example: You cannot do something like: http://www.askdifferent.com/images/uploadedscreenshot1.png+uploadedscreenshot2.png  I've attempted various delimiters for multiple recipients, such as code%20/code, code,/code, code|/code, code+/code, and code&amp;/code, and none of them working. I would not be surprised if there is no way to specify multiple recipients via the codesms:///code protocol URI.  <comment39018> Yeah, what I meant was just a SMS for multiple recipients.
