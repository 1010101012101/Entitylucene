iTunes in Yosemite does not respond to media keys <body> My media keys on my MBP for iTunes 12 in Yosemite don't respond. Spotify works fine. I'm using the kbdFN/kbd key to access the standard F keys.  These all work:  ul liScreen brightness/li liExpose/li liLaunch Pad/li liKeyboard brightness/li liVolume/li liPower key/li /ul  Is this a known issue or something I'm missing?  <answer153504> Do you happen to have Spotify or another media application open at the same time as iTunes? They'll hijack your media keys, passing the the controls to that application instead of iTunes.  Or perhaps Chrome is hijacking your media key keystrokes. You can get more information on that here: http://www.omgchrome.com/chrome-google-music-media-keys/  <comment180597> and it works if you do not use the Fn key ? <comment180598> @buscar it doesn't work either way <comment180601> did you try the Control-up/down arrow <comment180602> @Buscarì›ƒ i have that bound to something else. <comment180604> sorry on iTunes 12 it is the cmd-up/down <comment180606> those work fine but only when itunes is focused. <comment180686> brilliant thank you. it is chrome. <comment180691> Happy to help! :) <comment187671> I also got bit by Chrome on this. That's pretty annoying default behavior on their part.
