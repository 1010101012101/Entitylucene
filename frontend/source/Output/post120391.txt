What's the "built-in" firewall in OS X 10.9? <body> By "built-in" I mean the backend of the System firewall (System Preference-Security&amp;Privacy-Firewall). Is it ipfw or pf? (I know that ipfw was the backend for previous versions of OS X).  And, what are the commands/logs that I can use to determine which firewall is running?  <answer120397> The firewall in OS X 10.9 is now "pf".  It is controlled by the tool codepfctl/code which can also give you a lot of status about the firewall itself. Try codesudo pfctl -s all/code and you will get a huge dump of info. If you want a lot of information you can add one or two code-v/code to the front of the options for even more info - codesudo pfctl -v -v -s all/code  <comment140416> Excellent article on the topic: http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/05/15/using-pf-on-os-x-mountain-lion/
