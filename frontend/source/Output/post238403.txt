Location of Speakers on MacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch <body> I realize this question sounds rather idiotic, but I've truly looked all over the internet and haven't been able to find a simple answer (in a diagram or anything) telling me literally where the sound comes out of on a 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (late 2012). All I can see on the laptop itself are a bunch of vents at the connection between the screen and the keyboard, some longer vents on the left and right sides of the laptop's bottom, and the gaps between the keys themselves (which seems like a bit of a longshot, but who knows...). Could someone perhaps quickly enlighten me...  <answer238404> The speakers on the MacBook Pro 2012 are on the left and right sides between the aluminium case and the battery.  The photos below are of the Macbook Pro bottom case assembly.  The speakers are highlighted in red.  strongLeft Speaker:/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wX34J.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongRight Speaker:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2KJFR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The best place I have found on the web for information like this has been ifixit.com:  MacBook Pro 13" Retina Display Late 2012 Repair  <comment292383> Have a look at: [MacBook Pro 13" Retina Display Late 2012 Left Speaker Replacement](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2012+Left+Speaker+Replacement/12874) & [MacBook Pro 13" Retina Display Late 2012 Right Speaker Replacement](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2012+Right+Speaker+Replacement/12878) <comment292405> So to be clear, there's no designated holes of any sort through which the sound can exit from those internal speakers? <comment292411> Correct.  No designated holes
