Resize FusionDrive to fill empty space? <body> Context: I wanted to install Windows 8 onto my Mac by repartitioning my FusionDrive. Using the partition BootCamp provided didn't work, so I found a "solution" on Apple forums to create empty space instead and have the Windows installation media create a partition. Windows created the partition, but wouldn't install.   I went back to DiskUtility to erase the partitions it created (1 big one and 2 small ones). After trying to get rid of them I'm now stuck with a large amount of empty space in my FusionDrive and DiskUtility won't let me fill it or resize anything regarding the empty space (I've tried this in recovery mode too).  Here is what my DiskUtility looks like (ignore the 16GB USB): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2i0Ll.png" alt="DiskUtility"  The two drives my FusionDrive is compromised of are disk0 (1TB HDD) and disk1 (100GB SSD) from here:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         119.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         626.1 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk1s3    4:                        EFI NO NAME                 104.9 MB   disk1s4 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *739.9 GB   disk2 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.9 GB    disk3    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 WININSTALL              15.9 GB    disk3s1 /code/pre  You can see that my FusionDrive is disk2, and shows up with around 740GB.

The only difference is that you have a fusion drive and therefore some DiskIdentifiers differ.  Additionally you have a blocking partition on your HDD with certainty which has to be removed.  There is one undocumented command to resize or expand a CoreStorage volume group and an inherent logical volume:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size   /code/pre  The command expands or shrinks the whole CoreStorage Volume Group including the physical volume(s), the logical volume family and the logical volume in one step to the desired size.  emBeware: The command is vastly undocumented and as such potentially destructive./em  strongPreparation:/strong    ul liBackup your data./li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.
