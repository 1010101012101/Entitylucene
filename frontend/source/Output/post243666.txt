Brew doctor asking to update xcode, while its already updated <body> When I run brew doctor It says    precodeWarning: Your Xcode (6.4) is outdated Please update to Xcode 7.3.1. Xcode can be updated from the App Store. /code/pre  While I already have latest XCode cli, which I found out by running codepkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables/code which says:    precodepackage-id: com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables version: 7.3.1.0.1.1461711523 volume: / location: / install-time: 1466534515 groups: com.apple.FindSystemFiles.pkg-group com.apple.DevToolsBoth.pkg-group com.apple.DevToolsNonRelocatableShared.pkg-group  /code/pre  How to I fix it ?  <answer243696> The problem here is just simply that codebrew/code is detecting an old version of Xcode. If it was objecting to the version of the command line tools that you have installed you'd be getting a different error message.  precodeA newer Command Line Tools release is available. Update them from Software Update in the App Store. /code/pre  You can see the actual code here yourself. The checks for Xcode and the command line tools are separate.  The way to fix this message from codebrew doctor/code is either to remove the old version of Xcode or update it.
