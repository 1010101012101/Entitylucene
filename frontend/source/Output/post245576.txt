Where are Reminders stored on disk? <body> I did a clean install of El Capitan and would like to retrieve my Reminders from my Time Machine backup. Which files exactly do I need to restore? I have read reminders are stored in code~/Library/Calendars/code, but restoring that folder does not recreate the Reminders and also makes my Calendar completely blank.  Where do I need to look?  strongEdit/strong  I did find that reminders reside in code~/Library/Calendars/&lt;UUID&gt;.calendar/Events/&lt;UUID2&gt;.ics/code, but simply copying the entire code~/Library/Calendars/code and code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.reminders//code directories does not help.  <answer245690> While simply copying the directories mentioned in the question does not help (presumably, there is some database somewhere containing the uuids to the calendars and one has to copy that as well), it is possible to manually import the code*.ics/code files by simply opening them.  strongUpdate/strong  It seems that copying the folders and then rebooting actually does restore the reminders (or probably logout-login will suffice).  <comment302764> Just to be clear, isn't Reminders working with iCloud account? <comment302766> @rwzdoorn No, I have not connected reminders with iCloud. <comment302769> Have you attempted to restore anything else under `~/Library`?   `/Users/username/Library/Containers/com.apple.reminders` looks like a candidate. <comment302777> @ephsmith There does not seem to be anything of relevance in there. Copying the directory does nothing. <comment302778> Unfortunately, tracing file activity with Instruments does not work with Reminders while System Integrity Protection is enabled.
