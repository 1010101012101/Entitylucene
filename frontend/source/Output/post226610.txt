Where are Passcode Settings for ios 9.2.1 on iphone 5c <body> The location for these options is a mystery.  Related questions show "General | Touch ID and Passcode" . But my phone only has   precodeSounds Passcode /code/pre  The latter only allows changing the passcode .. but has no other settings. So where are those passcode configuration settings?  <answer226612> If you go to passcode, then "change passcode", you will have these options while entering a new passcode.  <comment275174> Per another question you commented and I replied: You have an iPhone 5c  that does NOT have Touch ID, therefor you will not have "Touch Id" options. <comment275180> Also, perhaps your confusing your phone asking for the passcode to enter passcode settings as a prompt to change the passcode... It's not. Upon entering Settings  Passcode you will be required to enter your current passcode... That first entry is not for a new passcode. <comment280658> @Tyson  Yours is the correct answer. That interface *is* confusing. I awarded to the other person Ryan since it was kinda close.
