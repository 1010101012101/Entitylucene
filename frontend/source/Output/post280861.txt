Can iPhone 5 work OK without hardware pin for power button door hinge? <body> I bought a new iPhone 5 frame and I have come to a dead end, because I don't have the pin which is holding the power button door hinge. Can iPhone 5 work OK without the pin for its power button door hinge?  If I just put the door in place and power button inside the door (so, in place too), will it work like that, or do I really need the hinge?
