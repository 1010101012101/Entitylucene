This morning, I have plugged the monitor to my laptop, and then hit power-on.  On starting, a large black border appeared at the top + bottom of my macbook pro screen (not the external). After many unsuccessful reboot, I have tried to stop all applications started on my previous session, and reboot. This has solved my problem, now I have the real full-screen.  <answer214894> Same problem with my Acer monitor. I've researched a lot online. Next few days my ordered VGA-DVId will test my last resort. So I suggest you might change your monitor's input to DVI. This solved the issue for me.
