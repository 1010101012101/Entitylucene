Disk activity, how to improve it? <body> Activity Monitor tells me that my Disk Activity is too high even when I'm not running 'heavy' programs. I have an iMac with Mac OS 10.6.8, processor 3.06 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, Memory 4GB.   Is there any way to improve my computer's performance? I monitored my computer and CPU usage is ok as well as Memory usage. I appreciate your help.  I hope there is a solution like this one (given to solve the same problem with Windows 8).  <comment195115> Please add at least a screenshot of the disk activity in Activity Monitor (or another monitoring app)
