Is there any way to remove an app icon (especially stickies) on mac's application switcher (cmd+tab menu)? <body> On Mac's application switcher I want to hide some applications such as Stickies. I always use Stickies, it is really useful for me that's why it's always running. But, I'm really fed up with it on kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇥ TAB/kbd. I want to get rid of it  Is there a way to do within altering any settings in macbook or using any third party software?  I tried the solution at "Is there a way to hide certain apps from the cmd+tab menu?". But it doesnot work maybe because of OS X Yosemite.  <answer217959> You could try this app. (It's paid though) GhostTile
