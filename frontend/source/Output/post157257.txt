Fn key working, F11 key working, but Fn + F11 not working <body> I have a MacBook Pro Retina 2014 with OS X 10.9.4. I use the kbdFn/kbd+kbdF11/kbd key a lot to show desktop. But since yesterday, the kbdFn/kbd+kbdF11/kbd has stopped working for me. I have a bluetooth keyboard as well, and it doesn't work on both the keyboards.  I know the keys are working fine, when I press kbdFn/kbd+kbdF12/kbd, it shows the dashboard. When I press just kbdF11/kbd, it reduces the volume. I even went to System Preferences - Mission Control and verified that the kbdF11/kbd is still configured for show desktop. I'm totally puzzled why they don't work together. Please help. Thanks.  <comment184895> Did you tried System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Restore Defaults? <comment184896> If system wont accept your settings it is time to use Disk Utility and repair the permissions. <comment184897> @jherran I tried that, still doesn't work <comment184919> I quit TextEdit and it started working again. I wonder what the issue was? <comment184958> Did you review your shortcuts for TextEdit to see if there's one overriding the system shortcut? <comment211404> Same problem. BUT only if I'm using Firefox or some other programs. I didn't tried with all the programs, so I'll see. If I have a folder open and I use fn + f11, it works. I'll have a look to the programs shortcuts... The issue might be there...
