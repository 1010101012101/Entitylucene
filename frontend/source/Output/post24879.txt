Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS 4.3 SDK installation problem on Mac OS X Lion <body> I recently brought a new Mac mini running Max OS X 10.7 Lion.  I downloaded the iOS SDK 4.3 and Xcode 3.2.6.dmg from Apple.  The download was successful and I was able to install it without any problem. But after installing, I cannot find Xcode in the code/Developer/Applications/code folder.  All I do see there are performance tools and utilities folders.  Can anybody help me in properly installing Xcode on Lion?  <answer24886> Look again in Applications. There's an codeInstall Xcode/code application.  Run it.  <answer24895> For Lion you need Xcode 4 (not 3.2) This is available from the App Store or from a paid Developer account).  This will install the installer in /Applications, run this to install Xcode to /Developer  <comment27981> Thanks for the response Randolph.I checked in /DEVELOPER/APPLICATIONS folder. There is nothing like that.And also in /DEVELOPER/Library folder there is no uninstall.So i am unable to uninstall it. <comment27989> It's in _/Applications_. <comment27994> @kiamlaluno- It is not present in /Applications <comment27995> Thanks for the response Mark.Do i need to remove Xcode 3.2 before installing xcode 4?The standard uninstall command for uninstalling xcode is also not working.Can i directly install xcode 4? <comment27998> xcode 3 and 4 can coexist - so if you have xcode 3 just add xcode 4 - in SL xcode 3 is renamed to /Developer-old <comment28000> The "Install Xcode" app is only present if you're downloading Xcode from the App Store. And if he were doing that, it would be Xcode 4, not Xcode 3.2.6. <comment28063> @Sreeram I was referring to Xcode 4.1, which is the version you should install on Mac OS X Lion.
