Why doesn't X11/XQuartz start on Lion? <body> After upgrading to Lion, X11 doesn't start. I downloaded XQuartz 2.7.0, it doesn't start either.  The crash dialog mentions the following problem:     X11:br   Dyld Error Message:br     Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libpixman-1.0.dylibbr     Referenced from: /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.binbr     Reason: Incompatible library version: X11.bin requires version 21.0.0 or later, but libpixman-1.0.dylib provides version 17.0.0        XQuartz:br   Dyld Error Message:br     Library not loaded: /opt/X11/*/libfreetype.6.dylibbr     Referenced from: /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.binbr     Reason: Incompatible library version: X11.bin requires version 14.0.0 or later, but libfreetype.6.dylib provides version 10.0.0   Unsetting codeDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH/code doesn't help either.  EDIT: I also reinstalled X11 from the Lion installer package as described here, but the problem is the same.  Can anyone help?  <answer35462> A quick check of OS X Lion shows:     $ otool -L /usr/X11/lib/libpixman-1.0.dylib   /usr/X11/lib/libpixman-1.0.dylib:     /usr/X11/lib/libpixman-1.0.dylib   (compatibility version 21.0.0, current version 21.2.0)     /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current   version 159.1.0)   If your libpixman-1.0 library has something different (i.e.: not version 21.x.x), you may want to re-install X11 from the Lion CD.  <answer39619> It appears that the GnuPlot package delivers an older version of libfreetype.6.dylib than is installed on Lion (or SnowLeopard, in my case).  precodeotool -L /Applications/Gnuplot.app/Contents/Resources/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib  /Applications/Gnuplot.app/Contents/Resources/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib:     /tmp/gnuplot-i386/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib (compatibility version 13.0.0, current version 13.2.0) /code/pre  Yet my error is that GnuPlot is trying to load "/usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib" and not the library contained in the GnuPlot package. That library is the right version:  precodeotool -L /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib  /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib:     /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib (compatibility version 14.0.0, current version 14.2.0) /code/pre  This is as far as I have gotten. I did note that the library aliases in the GnuPlot package all point to the libraries delivered with GnuPlot (4/15/2011 in my case), so my next trick will be to create a new alias for libfreetype.6.dylib pointing to the one in /usr/X11/lib and see if I get a new error.  Maybe the answer is to build GnuPlot on our Macs?  <answer51157> You can workaround this by changing the GnuPlot libfreetype library to point at the system one:  precode# Change to your GnuPlot install directory... $ cd /Applications/Gnuplot.app/Contents/Resources/lib # Backup the provided libfreetype... $ mv libfreetype.6.dylib libfreetype.6.dylib.bak # Link to the X11 provided one... $ ln -s /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib . /code/pre  <answer63998> ol liOpen /Applications/Utilities/X11, which opens a web page that tells you to install Xquartz). /li liInstall XQuartz.

I don't know which update caused it, but it works now...
