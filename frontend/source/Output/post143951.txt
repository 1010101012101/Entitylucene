Can't open Numbers, but can open Numbers.app/Contents/MacOS/Numbers <body> Okay, this is weird.  I can't open Numbers by trying to open the .app file, but I can open it by drilling down into the app and opening codeNumbers.app/Contents/MacOS/Numbers/code via terminal.  Anyone have any idea what might be going on here and how to fix it?  I've rebooted &amp; re-installed the app.  <comment169577> What does `/Applications/Utilities/Console` say around the timestamps when you're trying to launch Numbers.app? <comment169578> @thankyour -- Nothing.  (There are various log messages, but nothing consistent with when I'm try to open Numbers multiple times, other than Finder "you clicked on something" messages) <comment169581> If you use the Get Info what does it shows? Also use the Disk utility and repair the permissions.
