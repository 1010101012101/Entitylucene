How to assign a keyboard shortcut to create an empty text file in Finder? <body> I like that codeCmd+Shift+N/code creates a new folder in the current directory in Finder. I would like to have a similar command like codeCmd+Control+N/code or codeCmd+Control+Shift+N/code that creates an empty text file in the current directory.  There's quite a bit of discussion on SuperUser and on this site, here and here.  However, some of the solutions seem out of date, others are mouse driven, or involve somewhat elaborate multi-click processes.  strongHow can I assign a shortcut key like codeCmd+Control+N/code to create a new empty text file in Finder on OSX?/strong  <comment140971> Was there a solution you figured out(that could possibly help others)?
