iOS app that uses Google Maps v2 API? <body> I need an app on AppStore that uses Google Maps v2 API. I need that app to confirm that there isn't a bug that i am experiencing in my PhoneGap application that is using Google Maps SDK for iOS. Basically i am experiencing delay in changing map view. And that small bug is so confusing that its hard for me to believe that it exist in native Google Maps apps on iOS.  <comment192607> you want us to find it for you? <comment192608> Well i wouldn't mind that. But i was hoping for someone who developed such app to point me to it. Otherwise i can't know which maps version is an app running.
