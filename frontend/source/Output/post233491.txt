Get current time with/in milliseconds from OS X command line <body> I'm trying to get the current time from OS X command line to work with in AppleScript to output the elapsed time.  Currently I'm using this script:  precodeset timea to do shell script "date +%s" ##something is executed set timeb to do shell script "date +%s" set runningtime to timeb - timea /code/pre  But it is too unprecised, strongso I'm looking for a way how to get the elapsed precisely with milliseconds/strong or somethin.  Thanks. :)  <comment285338> You'll likely want to script your timing in bash (faster to execute) than AppleScript - you could use the `gdate` command or `logger` to dump the timing to a file for analysis external to the script if desired...
