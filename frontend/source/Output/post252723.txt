Macbook Pro mid 2009 exernal monitor connected Macbook screen turns to grey lines, or black, external monitor works fine <body> Yesterday, while working on Photoshop, on my external monitor, having the palets at my Macbook screen, the Macbook screen turned into black, then it came back, and then black again. The external monitor keeps working fine. I looked at the internet and found suggestions to reset SMC. I did that, but that didn't help.I even removed the battery.  Than I booted the Macbook in Safe mode. For a short while I had a good screen so I changed the mainwindow to the external monitor in SP. Now I can work on that monitor. The computer works fine only the screen of the Macbook Pro is now with thin grey lines. When I move a window from the external monitor to the Macbook screen it looks like "greyed out". I did a screen capture to show how the lines are, but the screencapture shows just a normal screen !?  As far as I understand there is only one videocard in the Macbook Pro, and because the external monitor has a good picture I suppose it is not the graphic card. Could it be the LED controler? And if so, is there a way to reset that?  I hope someone can help me.  Laurens
