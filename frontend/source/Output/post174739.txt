How can I turn off encrypted iPhone backup without a password? <body> I forgot my password for iPhone backup. How can I recover the password so I can turn off the backups?  <answer174740> If you have a password encrypted backup you can't restore it without the password. If you could it would be no use of encrypting the backup.  <answer174743> If you're using a Mac, it may be saved in Keychain.  Per Apple's support article:  ol liOpen iTunes Preferences and select the Devices tab. Note the time of the device’s backup./li liRight-click the desired backup and choose "Show in Finder"./li liFinder should now be open, showing the backup selected. Click the Edit menu and choose Copy./li liOpen Keychain Access from /Applications/Utilities/./li liPaste the backup folder's name into the search box in the top-right corner of Keychain Access./li liIf there is a password for the backup, you should see it in Keychain Access./li liDouble-click the backup in Keychain Access./li liClick the button “Show password”./li liYou may be asked to enter your login keychain password. After doing so, click Allow. You should see your backup password./li liUse this password to restore from your backup./li /ol  If it's not in Keychain, and you are the administrator of the device (meaning it was set up for by your workplace or other administrator) the support article indicates the password is not recoverable.  <answer212045> Recently I published a tutorial like guideline to recover the iTunes backup password on windows. That password is safeguarded by the iPhone. So iTunes gets the encryption setting info from the phone, not from windows. There are many brute force tools out there. They did not work for me given the length of my passwords in general.br The guideline worked for me. Looking at the recovered PW, I am convinced that I did set that password myself and it was not some kind of auto-set by IOS, as some suggest in this 30 page long post Lost Password to iPhone Backup  Roughly the recovery is possible by the taking the following steps (tried on IOS 9.02).

I have backups throughout the encrypted backup time with PKGBackup. <comment205837> I'm not on any school or work network, and don't have a mac. <comment205838> In that case you'd need to erase the device and set it up as new. (Restoring from a backup made during the encrypted timeframe would likely cause the option to remain enabled.)

Stack Overflow exists to document actual solutions and not be a link saver. Linking to the original content is awesome, but please consider adding that knowledge here for the record. <comment256122> Think there are many examples on stack exchange where references to tools are given.  I am happy to add more detail and give the reference. Why is the word solution in quotes? <comment256126> Thanks for the edit. It's okay to include a link/reference to give credit where credit is due. Nevertheless the idea is to make the answer stand alone.
