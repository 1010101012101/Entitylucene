Is there a way to redirect myself on a pdf document opened with Safari? <body> I have a new Mac and I use Safari. I was wondering if there is a way to adjust Safari/Pages/whatever when I open a pdf document as a new tab such that when I hyperlink within the documents contents I can go back by some command to the previous stage of the document.   For example, when I open a pdf document with hyperlinked table of contents. Imagine I choose to go to chapter 3 by clicking it at the table of contents. Then I am redirected to chapter 3. Is there a way to go back to the table of contents after?  I know this happens with Adobe reader on web browsers but I have no clue about the combination Safari/Pages etc.
