Yosemite Messages not receiving iMessages <body> After upgrading to Yosemite I am not receiving iMessages in the Messages app. SMS forwarding is working fine.  The log file seems to point to a certificate issue. I'm seeing this in the logs every time I attempt to send an iMessage  precode- No cert found, not in registered URI set  imagent[253]: [Warning] callerURI - No bindings !!  .... : [Warning] Group message controler failed to prepare chat: IMDChat /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uq4OG.png" alt="Not delivered error screenshot"  And the result is always an instant Not Delivered error.  <comment185347> Log out of iMessage on your Mac and wait 15 minutes, then log back in. <comment186560> Thanks @tubedogg, I gave that a try but am still seeing this issue.
