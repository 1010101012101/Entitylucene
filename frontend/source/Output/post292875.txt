iPhone 5: How to upgrade from 7.0.4 to iOS 9 and above? <body> I have iPhone 5 which is running iOS 7.0.4, in Software updates section, it is showing I can upgrade to iOS 8.4.1, I've read on other sites that iPhone 5 can be upgrade to iOS 9 and one user on Apple forum even said that it can be upgraded to iOS 10 as well.  So why it is not showing me the last supported version? Or I have to first upgrade to 8.4.1 and only then it will allow me to upgrade to iOS 9?  <answer292876> iPhone 5 can run iOS 10.x  You may need to do iOS upgrades in sequence, but I can't find definitive info on this.  You might want to use iTunes on Mac or PC to update your phone to keep settings intact.  <comment369504> I've read somewhere that iPhone 5 runs slower on iOS 10 than iOS 9.
