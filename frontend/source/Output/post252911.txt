Download older version of Xcode? <body> I upgraded to Xcode 8 and now I really regret it. I'm trying to download Xcode 7.3.1 here: https://developer.apple.com/download/more/   It is a 4.8 GB file.  After three attempts - the download appears to finish around the 1-2 GB mark - and then I can't open or resume the download:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/syErS.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I download this without the download being disrupted? Is there another place to download older version of Xcode?  <answer253269> Try Google Chrome and curl:  ul liOpen Terminal/li liOpen Google Chrome and go to Developer Apple downloads./li liScroll down to Xcode 7.3.1 and click the + sign.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0UZL0.png" alt="enter image description here" /li liopen Google Chrome's Developer Tools (kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdI/kbd)  Network panel/li liClick on Xcode 7.3.1.dmg to start the Xcode download/li liRight-click Xcode 7.3.1.dmg in the network panel  Copy as cURL  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MOwOG.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liStop the Xcode 7.3.1.dmg download on Google Chrome's Downloads page or in the status bar/li liPaste the content of the pasteboard to the Terminal window with kbdcmd/kbdkbdV/kbd and add code-o Xcode7.3.1.dmg/code. Then hit the enter key.  Example:  precodecurl 'http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.3.1/Xcode_7.3.1.dmg' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, ... &lt;redacted&gt; ...; as_dc=nwk; ADCDownloadAuth=&lt;redacted&gt;' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --compressed -o Xcode7.3.1.dmg /code/pre  If you add additionally code-L -C -/code at the end (after the suggested code-o Xcode7.3.1.dmg/code), you can resume previous downloads (i.e. download interrupted server-side)./li /ul  I hope this works for you.  <comment314703> That's the correct location to get the download.  Are you sure you have enough free space on your Mac and that your network connection is working? <comment314704> Are you able to mount the .dmg file directly into Disk Utility? <comment314705> Positive on both. It's not a great connection - but it's working. I would think there should be a way to resume a download too. <comment314706> fbara, that has nothing to do with the available space, the dmg is corrupted. Did you open it from the directory it was downloaded? <comment314707> I sure did. I downloaded twice - once it cam out at around 600MB - the second time it ended at 1.8GB - it just never finished downloading but it pretended like it did. <comment314708> try with either Axel, or wget. both will require the use of home-brew. <comment314711> I tried 'wget http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.3/Xcode_7.3.dmg' doesn't work at all <comment314787> How long does your download take? If your connection is really slow, then it might be that your session was closed, before the file finished downloading. So you could try to browse in the developer section form time to time while downloading to keep the session alive. <comment314838> I finally managed to download it late at night. I'm on a 6MBpS connection. It took 3 hours and 20 minutes. I also thought it was a session issue where I had to go back into the developer portal every hour. But there was no need for it. In any case, there should be a way to resume a paused download IMO. <comment359985> Worked for me! The curl download progress stagnated towards the end, so I stopped the download (Ctrl-C) and ran the same command again but added `-C -` before the URL (`curl -C - URL from Chrome`) to resume from where the download was stopped. File now completely downloaded =)
