Why are two identical external monitors displaying at different resolutions? <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, Md 2012) running OS X El Capitan 10.11.3.   I purchased 1x DisplayPort to VGA and 1x DisplayPort to DVI.  I plugged these two into the 2x DisplayPorts on the MacBook Retina.  When I view the screens, however, one of them shows up fine but the other is at a low resolution (800x600).  I've seen some related posts, but nothing addressing this situation specifically. Most seem to be dealing with daisy chaining two external displays off of a single DisplayPort, but this MacBook Pro has two ports, so no daisy chaining.  Any thoughts on why the two different resolutions?  <answer228457> My guess is that it's in the DisplayPort to VGA not supporting a high enough resolutionâ€“although 800x600 is rather low, there's not a hard rule for VGA. Have you tried switching which monitor uses VGA and seen if the resolution tracks?  <comment278567> Why not use the built-in HDMI port alongside the DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter? <comment278587> @jcaron - I think that is what I'm going to do, just wanted to see if there was any way to get current config working. <comment278590> VGA is a very, very old standard, and should only be used for backwards compatibility (connect an old VGA-only monitor to a computer, or connect a VGA-only computer to a monitor). If both devices support DVI or HDMI, you should definitely go for those.
