Use find in Terminal to remove directories and files of same search parameter <body> If I type the following into Terminal, it will remove all files that meet the search parameter:  precodesudo find . -type f -name "*Xilisoft*" -exec rm -rf {} \; /code/pre  Then if I start again and type it with coded/code instead of codef/code it will remove all the directories  precodesudo find . -type d -name "*Xilisoft*" -exec rm -rf {} \; /code/pre  How do I get it to remove type codef/code and coded/code in one fell swoop?  <answer120401> You can provide multiple code-type/code options with code-o/code, such as code-type f -o -type d/code in a single command.  precodefind . -name "*Xilisoft*" -type f -o -name "*Xilisoft*" -type d /code/pre  supcode-o/code matches all parameters, so the code-name/code is provided twice in the above command.br Note that find can delete the results using code-delete/code rather than code-exec rm -rf {}/code./sup  <comment140643> I didn't know about the `-delete` option so this comes as a welcome piece of information.
