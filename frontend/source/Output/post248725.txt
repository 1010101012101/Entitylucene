Prevent OS X 10.11 to display "can't read disk" message <body> I always have connected to my MBPr a Transcend JetDrive Lite 330.  JetDrive Web   I have installed Ubuntu on that SD Card, so it has EXT4 file system. I installed  some packages on the Mac for being able to mount that SD Card in case I need it. The packages are:  ul liFUSE for OS X/li lifuse-ext2/li /ul  I'm completely able to mount the SD Card volume to a mountpoint which I created for this purpose:  precodesudo mount -t fuse-ext2 /dev/disk2s1 ~/.linux/ /code/pre  Now you know the antecedents.  Every time I turn on the Mac, the system shows this message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yzs4d.png" alt="SD Card File System was not readable"  Is there any way to avoid this message? I don't want to auto mount the SD Card, I have created an alias for that. I need to avoid this message. It's very annoying.  diskutil list shows the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aci3E.png" alt="sudo diskutil list"  /dev/disk2s1 is ubuntu  /dev/disk2s2 is, obviously, the swap  /dev/disk2s3 has no format. I didn't use it. I plan to install there some other things or use as more space. I didn't decided yet.  <comment308299> Hi klanomath, I download the .dmg from SourceForge and execute the .pkg . I install fuse-ext2 v0.0.7 <comment308306> Done. Thanks for help! :) <comment308307> In my opinion this is either related to the FileVault encryption of your main drive or one/two of the 3 partitions of the SD card is/are formatted with an other file system than ext4. <comment308308> disk2s2 is a swap. disk2s3 hasn't be formatted yet. I think is the swap partition. <comment309008> I finally delete the swap partition and format the disk (except linux partition) in exfat. All goes good now. Thanks klanomath
