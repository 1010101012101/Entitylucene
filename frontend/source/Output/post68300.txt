Hide the Finder sidebar permanently <body> I've Googled for this a little bit, and I wasn't able to find an obvious answer, so is it possible to hide the Finder sidebar completely? So that it never comes back until I tell it to? The same goes for the toolbar.  Thanks for any help you can provide. :)  Extra info:  ul liI am using OS X Mountain Lion on this Mac./li /ul  <answer68303> Open Finder, both options are in the View menu.  precodeView -&gt; Hide Sidebar /code/pre  For the Status bar,  precodeView -&gt; Hide Status Bar /code/pre  <answer68313> New Finder windows in Mountain Lion appear to behave as in previous versions:   Create a new Finder window in any manner--Command-N, click on Finder in dock, etc. Adjust this window as to screen location, size, view style--everything customizable. Close the window -- and all future new Finder windows will be exactly as you have set.   <answer86276> precodedefaults write com.apple.finder ShowSidebar -bool false; killall Finder /code/pre  codeShowToolbar -bool false/code didn't seem to work.  <answer205300> Use FinderMinder. In preferences check Run AppleScript, click edit and add this line  precodeset toolbar visible to false /code/pre  <comment79306> Hide it just for a certain window?  Or for all future windows?  Or for all windows created in the past as well? <comment79307> I would like to hide it for absolutely everything, no matter the day it is, or was, open. <comment79312> I've tried that, but it appears again by re-opening the folder. lol BTW, I don't want to hide the sidebar. <comment79313> ahh, odd functionality.  creating an new window in Finder using cmd+N opens a new window with the Sidebar hidden, but opening a new window by double clicking opens a new window with the sidebar... odd <comment99619> Thanks for the answer. :) So this would make it automatically never appear again? <comment99622> Yeah, but it doesn't seem to affect some special folders like trash. <comment99623> I see. Thanks again! <comment279294> not works on elcapitan <comment330574> Not working on 10.12
