iPod and iPhone iMessage inquiry <body> Okay, so my iPhone and iPod are both connected therefore the iMessages that I receive on my iPhone are also sent to my iPod, but earlier by mistake I disconnected my iPod through my iPhone settings. Couple hours pass by and I just connected them again but I just wanted to know will the iMessages I received earlier ever go through to my iPod or will it only receive the iMessages from the time I re-connected?  <answer147965> Normally, your iPod will load the previous messages. That's from my experience...   <comment174424> Do you know how long that normally takes? <comment174425> @user93190 10 seconds... <comment174426> It's been an half an hour & nothing but the most recent iMessages popped up on my iPod. Does that mean I should give up on receiving those old messages? <comment174427> @user93190 Hmm, probably.. As I said, it takes just a few seconds for me to load the older messages.. <comment174447> Okay thanks for the help Thomas! :)
