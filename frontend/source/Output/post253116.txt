Is there a way to disable the captive portal on iOS? <body> I've got an iOS device that I want to block from EVER connecting to a public hotspot that might require someone to click on an agreement.  Is there any way to disable the iPhone/iPad's captive portal functionality?  <comment314984> Before I try to answer - can you help me understand a bit? The captive portal comes from the web server on a network so by definition, you are already connected when that function gets activated. How is this different than just not saving any networks that you don't trust so you never connect to them in the first place? <comment315002> When an iOS device associates with a WiFi network that has limited network connectivity, it contacts a variety of URLs to detect whether the user has to click through some sort of legal agreement that consents to various terms of usage (usually an agreement not to hack or look at CP). If it detects one, it will pop up a non-Safari browser built into the OS in order to let the user read the terms and click "Accept" or whatever. What I'm trying to do is disable the browser entirely, since I don't want the user to be able to click or agree to anything.
