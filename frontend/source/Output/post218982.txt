Data written to USB to Serial adaptor differs from data received â€“ regression in OS X 10.11.2 <body> After I update to OS X 10.11.2, El-Capitan, from 10.11, my Aten USB to Serial UC 232A no longer works properly.  When I send hexadecimal data, for example client send : code02 01 10 30 30 30 03 CB/code, the server will receive code02 01 10 FF 82 8A 03 CB 00/code. Server always receive different data even when I send same data twice. Somebody can help me? Thanks.
