iOS Simulator installations fail on Xcode 6.4 on El Capitan v10.11 <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JK1aN.jpg" alt=""     Could not download and install iOS 7.1 Simulator. Authorization is required to install the packages.   Facing this issue on Xcode 7 Beta 6 version too.  Can't seem to understand why?  <answer202498> Xcode 7 does not support iOS 8.4 and earlier.  Xcode 6.4 does not support iOS 7.1.2 and earlier.  <answer213867> Running the following command in Terminal  precodesudo /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode /code/pre  and then downloading the simulator 7.1 works for me. I'm using Xcode 6.4, OS X El Capitan.  <comment261154> Can you actually use the 7.1 simulator in El Capitan? Do you have Xcode 7 installed too or only Xcode 6.4? - Thanks <comment285322> This makes possible to install it, but I get a message "unable to load" when I try to run the app. So I think it's just not supported
