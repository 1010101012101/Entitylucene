iMac won't show iOS app folders in iCloud drive, but MacBook does <body> After having to sign out and sign in again to iCloud due to a new email address, my iMac does not show any of my iOS related app folders in iCloud Drive (e.g. Scanner Pro, Garageband,...). They were showing up before signing out of iCloud, and they are showing up on my MacBook correctly.  Other folders work fine, but I have to launch the corresponding Mac App once to have iCloud load them. iCloud and iCloud Drive works fine on all my devices, including my iMac. Just those iOS app folders are missing. They show up on iCloud.com and on every iOS app in the iCloud drive app and on my Macbook and they work fine.   I am using iOS 10.2 and macOS 10.12.2, but this behavior initially occured when I sign out of iCloud which was when macOS 10.12.1 and iOS 10.1.x where installed on my devices.   Anyone got an idea?
