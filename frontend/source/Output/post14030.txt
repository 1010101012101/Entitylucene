Location of services created in Automator <body> Long-time ago i created a service in Automator, which still works. But i want to change the code and it isn't located in either /Library/Services/ nor ~/Library/Services/ as they are both empty  Have i lost the source code or can i restore it otherwise?  <answer14031> emstrongEdited to add/em/strong  Automator services are definitely supposed to be stored in code~/Library/Services/code, based on my Googling. I just created a new service in Automator and it placed it there.  hr  Perhaps code~/Library/Application Support/Automator//code  Alternately, when I last made a service I believe that I had to save it as an code.app/code first, so you might search for apps.  <answer14037> Did you try code~/Library/Workflows//code?  <answer14041> Try searching for code.workflow/code in Spotlight to find all workflow files in your user folder.  The service will be called codeWhatever the Service Name Is in the Services Menu.workflow/code.  If you prefer the Terminal, this command will do the same thing, searching the current directory and all the folders underneath it:  codefind ./ -name "*.workflow"/code  EDIT: Corrected a small mistake in the Terminal command.  Apparently code-type f/code doesn't work on code.workflow/code files.  <answer14095> As others have said, services are normally in one of the Library/Services folders (~/Library/Services, /Library/Services, and /System/Library/Services).  If just looking there doesn't turn it up, another option is to spy on what files are being opened when you invoke the service, with something like:  precodesudo opensnoop -n WorkflowService /code/pre  ... and then running the service, and looking through the results to see if you can spot the relevant file.  If it isn't an Automator-based service, you might have to leave off the code-n WorkflowService/code (although you'll have a lot more irrelevant files to sort through because you'll be seeing emevery/em file anything in the entire OS opens).  <answer95237> The best way that I know to find workflows or anything else is to use the app: "EasyFind.app".  Unlike the Finder and Spotlight and even the Unix command-line, EasyFind.app can be configured to search everywhere, and it has a Unix-style pattern-matching capability.  For example "*.workflow" can be used to find any Service on your entire hard-drive.  Best of all EasyFind.app is free and legal.  EasyFind.app  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b73GB.png" alt="Configuring EasyFind.app to find any Automator workflow (including services)"  INSTEAD of using extra programs you can run your Terminal and enter command:  precodemdfind .workflow /code/pre  <answer100583> The location of the user created services is under:  precode/Users/&lt;user_name&gt;/Library/Services/ /code/pre  (tested Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.4)  other locations you get by entering following command in Terminal:  precodemdfind .workflow /code/pre  <answer131639> I had the same problem.  I found following ~/Library/Services/ does exist, on my 10.8 OSX.br But I can not see it with Finder, only from Terminal.   I aslo find this:br http://www.macworld.com/article/1161156/view_library_folder_in_lion.htmlbr That explain it little better.     <answer210699> If the Services of workflow is generated by system, It will located in "/System/Library/Services".  But if you workflow(services) added by yourself from Automator, it will located in "/Users/[your username]/Library/Services".  <answer245418> It is a hidden folder:code/Macintosh HD/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Services/code. The best way to get there is either create a new service in automator and save it and follow steps below, or if you have one created already follow these steps:  ul liOpen System Preferences  Keyboard and click the Shortcut tab./li liFind the service that you created/li liRight click on the service and Open in Finder./li /ul  It will reveal the hidden folder.  <comment15055> The /Library/Application Support/Automator/ folder didn't exist, but ~/Library/Application Support/Automator/ did and was empty -.-' <comment15063> @Tyilo Sorry, that's what I meant. Fixed my answer, even if it's wrong. :) <comment15066> Doesn't exist either and also tried /Library/Workflows/ <comment15069> Strange...  `~/Library/Services/` is the default location for new services created in Automator, and I just confirmed that myself by creating a new service. <comment15091> No result in Spotlight and the terminal command showed no results: 'tyilos-macbook:~ Tyilo$ cd / tyilos-macbook:/ Tyilo$ sudo find ./ -type f -name "*.workflow" Password: find: .//dev/fd/3: Not a directory find: .//dev/fd/4: Not a directory' <comment15092> @Tyilo Sorry, there was a typo in the Terminal command that I corrected.  Try it again, and if it doesn't find anything in your home directory (`~`), try running it from the system's root directory (i.e. enter `cd /` before running the find command).  *This will take a while, so be prepared to be patient.* <comment15093> @Tyilo And of course, you can search the root folder in the GUI by opening `Macintosh HD` in Finder and typing `.workflow` into the search box.  (Check the `File Name` option instead of `Contents` for a faster search.)  The only disadvantage of this is that it won't search in hidden or system folders, but you probably won't need it to anyway. <comment15133> @Austin My file wasn't between the files using `cd /` and `sudo find ./ -name "*.workflow"  ~/Desktop/services.txt`. I found two other folders which also could be a possible location, but they didn't contain the file. The locations were `/Library/Application Support/Apple/Automator/Workflows/` and `/System/Library/Services/`. I've uploaded the file here: http://cl.ly/6i1t <comment15138> @Matthew Frederick Found all app files using @Austin command, and none of them matched my service title <comment15139> @Austin also tried with `sudo find ./ -name "*"  ~/Desktop/all.txt` and still no match <comment15140> @Tyilo I just checked my system and realized that I'd created an AppleScript app that I then used Automator to turn into a service, hence my .app suggestion. As a result both .app and .scpt files existed for it. Unless you did the same, my suggestion is no help. <comment15166> @Tyilo Perhaps the extension changed somehow?  Try searching for `sudo find / -name "The Exact Service Name Including Spaces.*"`  (Without the "dot", that should find it across your entire hard drive regardless of the folder from which you initiate the search.) <comment15167> @Tyilo Any chance it would be on a network drive? <comment15173> @Matthew Frederick Don't have the .scpt file of it :s, but the service file thingy must be somewhere, else it wouldn't work <comment15176> @Tyilo Have you tried the in-depth search @Austin suggested but for files ending with `.service`. A number of my services have this extension. <comment15203> `sudo opensnoop -n WorkflowService` didn't show anything at all and couldn't get any reasonable out of just `sudo opensnoop` <comment15207> @Tyilo: I'm pretty sure that means it's not actually an Automator-based service.  Might it be provided by an application you have installed? <comment15219> You were right! I thought i made it myself... Thank you very much! <comment111692> Can you elaborate on where EasyFind is able to find stuff but `/usr/bin/find` isn't? <comment111748> @patrix I've been looking at /usr/bin/find again.  I believe that it will work, it's just that EasyFind.app is easier to use. <comment111749> @patrix: The following command works OK for me: find ~ -name "*.workflow"  better than find ./ -name "*.workflow" which only searches the current directory.  From the command-line, it is really /usr/bin/locate that I don't trust.  It is faster, but the files have to be indexed before they can be found.  Also, I don't trust Finder  Finder nor Spotlight to find everything because they don't open up application bundles or the ~/Library folder which is not invisible in Mountain Lion.  So /usr/bin/find is OK, it's just that for me, I still prefer EasyFind.app because it's easier to use. <comment214255> This is precisely where I found mine, automator scripts created on Mavericks, but running Yosemite now. <comment220920> still the same on 10.9.5 and when in doubt the mdfind does it. <comment331091> This was it for me on El Capitan. Note that `/Users/username/Library` is a hidden and/or system directory, so you'll need to [activate the proper settings](http://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/) to display it in Finder. <comment347014> I have gained 10 experience points and hit +1 against buggy processes having now learned `opensnoop`
