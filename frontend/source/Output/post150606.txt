My mac os x (10.9.5) will automatically change time to new time-zone ? How can i check this?  <answer150608> If your settings in the syst pref for date and time are set to:  Time Zone- Russia/Moscow  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z8zEq.jpg" alt="zone"  And you set the Set time using the Apple Europe server, then it will do it automatically.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/owjI3.jpg" alt="time"  So it gets its date/time from the server- following what ever Mr. Putin has decided. Just to compare when I made the above screen shots it was Wed. Oc. 15 at 1:25 (after midnight here in USA-Pacific time.  <answer150609> If you want to check your system to change the time zone , you can run this command in terminal:  precodezdump -v /etc/localtime | grep 2014 /code/pre  If you see two lines:  precode/etc/localtime  Sat Oct 25 21:59:59 2014 UTC = Sun Oct 26 01:59:59 2014 MSK isdst=0 /etc/localtime  Sat Oct 25 22:00:00 2014 UTC = Sun Oct 26 01:00:00 2014 MSK isdst=0 /code/pre  Time zone will be changed automatically.  ul liYou can manually update time zones: You can find time preferences on the Mac OS on the two files: /etc/localtime and /usr/share/icu/icudtXXX.dat./li /ul  Settings for console time are stored on the /etc/localtime.

NTP server (including apple's time.whatever.apple.com) would only provide you with precise UTC/GMT time; your local time is then calculated depending on the settings of your timezone (see /etc/localtime and /usr/share/zoneinfo - there is IANA Timezone Database that gets updated when timezones shift due to legislation or whatever). Now, these timezone definitions are usually updated with the OS X updates/hotfixes. Luckily, 10.9.5 will adjust your clock to 1:00 AM the second after Sun Oct 26 01:59:59 2014 MSK <comment179814> @kervich I did not know that, thanks for clarifying.
