OS X El Capitan is losing connection to Active Directory <body> I have successfully joined three iMacs to our Active Directory. Everything is working well except one thing. Every time when the iMac goes to its screensaver, we can't log back in. The screen shakes as if the password entered is wrong (which after five attempts would lock the network account) which it never does because it's not ''talking'' to the Active Directory.  The only solution is to reboot or go to the switch user tab and reconnect to my account (it is a mobile account). I see the same issue on my three iMacs.  Power saving is disabled. Do any of you have this problem ? 10.11.6 is my current OS X version.  The connection is lost ten minutes after a boot up, no matter if the screensaver is on or power saving. It might be related to our AD.  precode2016-10-27 09:37:26.534823 EDT - AID: 0x0000000000000000 - 426.1137.1141.1142, Node: /Active Directory/**AD**/**DOMAIN**, Module: ldap - failed GSSAPI authentication for authzid - 'u:imac-606381$' authcid - 'imac-606381$' error -2 /code/pre  <comment323822> Sometimes I get :  Retrieved keychain password for 'MachineName' module ' ' node /ActiveDirectory/DOMAIN and sometime it just fail...
