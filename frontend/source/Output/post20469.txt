Can Mail.app be configured to insert a blank line before the text of the previous message in a reply? <body> Currently, a reply window contains this:     *new message text starts here*br   ... old/previous message text starts here...   What I want is this     *new message text starts here*        ... old/previous message text starts here...   <answer20472> Not ideal but:   Go into Preferences: Signatures, create a new Signature, erase the name and e-mail address, and hit Enter once to create a blank line. Then check the "Place signature above quoted text" box.   Note: once a signature has been saved with actual text, Mail won't let you blank it out, so make sure you do this with a new sig, rather than editing an old one.  <answer20552> I believe you can configure the free QuoteFix Mail plugin to do what you want.  <comment22861> That did it. Was a bit tricky and I had to fiddle around a bit in the signature settings, but I got it to work. Behaves just as I wanted now. Thank you! <comment22863> Good idea! When I can solve a problem without needing additional software I'll always choose that option, though.  Thanks anyway!
