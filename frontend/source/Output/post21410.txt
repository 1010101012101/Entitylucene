Why does three-finger swipe gesture not support natural scrolling? <body> There are three page swipe gesture options in Lion:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JVDTi.png" alt="Swiping gestures in Mac OS lion"  ul listrongScroll left or right with two fingers/strong, which is new to Lion, has a neat animation and is currently supported only by Safari./li listrongSwipe left or right with three fingers/strong existed in Snow Leopard and doesn't have the animation, but is supported by other applications./li listrongSwipe with two or three fingers/strong enables both of these gestures./li /ul  hr  Now, I would be happy with the third option, however it seems that strongthree-finger swipe gesture completely ignores natural scrolling preference/strong.  If you disable natural scrolling, all options work identically, but if you turn it back on, two-finger swipe changes its direction, while three-finger gesture stays the same.  This leaves me utterly confused because to go Back in Safari with natural scrolling I can:  ul liswipe emright/em with strongtwo/strong fingers, or/li liswipe emleft/em with strongthree/strong fingers./li /ul  This gets just as confusing in Mission Control or any other application that supports navigation.  hr  strongCan I override this behavior and “invert” three-finger gestures, too, and should I?br What was the idea behind this design decision?/strong  <answer21465> This may be one of those things that is labeled as a "feature not a bug." It's possible that the swiping gestures that are the same as the gestures on Snow Leopard are considered "Legacy" gestures. If that's the case then it is possible that having it "backwards" Is the expected behavior. If it's a legacy gesture then it may be considered to ignore natural scrolling because that is a "new" feature. I'm not saying that's how it should work, if you ask me if you change the direction of scrolling, it should apply to all gestures, not just the scrolling ones. I've moved mine back to the two finger option for the moment. You should file it at http://www.apple.com/feedback to make sure that Apple knows how confusing this is.  <answer163600> A workaround to make the three finger swipe natural:  ul liDisable "Swipe between pages" in the trackpad settings/li liInstall BetterTouchTool/li liReassign the three finger gestures as following:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ne5advnzd1xhvuq/Screenshot%202014-12-26%2010.43.11.png?dl=0/li /ul  <answer247635> Follow-up on this question, since I arrived here searching for how to invert the three-finger swipe gesture in the later versions of OS X (El Capitan etc.), where this is switching screens (Mission Control, aka spaces) and not pages anymore.  I hope this will be useful for others.  Building on the answer by shock_one, you can use BetterTouchTool to invert the 3F swipe.  Steps:  ul liIn System Preferences/Trackpad/More Gestures, ensure "Swipe between full-screen apps" is disabled/li liIn BetterTouchTool or equivalent, create new gestures for mapping "three finger swipe left" to the Predefined Action/OS X Functionality/Move Right a Space, and viceversa/li /ul  Alternatively, you can use other macro tools, by mapping the 3F swipe to the shortcut key used in Mission Control for switching spaces.  <comment23484> Sounds like a bug to me. Similar legacy bugs include references to install DVDs in Disk Utility, and a few others I spotted... <comment23485> I think the scope is *too* large for it to be a bug. Maybe the decision was to keep “navigation” gestures always pointing to target direction, as they swipe and not scroll. But this is a speculation. <comment130499> Doesn't look like it's happened yet. FWIW I sent my feedback. 4-finger swipes for switching workspaces also follow natural direction so I don't see why they can't just offer the same option for 3-finger swipes too. <comment220313> I had to disable 3 finger tap lookup in system preferences and enable it in BTT to avoid accidental 3-finger taps in Terminal.app while using settings above. <comment366649> not the same gesture though, it doesn't "stick" while switching workspaces, ie it executes a key shortcut
