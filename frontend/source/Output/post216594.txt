Terminal floats between desktops <body> On my mac, OS X Yosemite, if I have terminal open and multiple desktops the terminal window appears on all desktops. How do I disable this feature and have the terminal stick to the desktop it was launched on or dragged to?  <answer216599> Control or right clicking the dock icon should allow you to pin the app to a specific desktop.   <comment261842> Perfect solution!
