Error when connecting USB Drive to VirtualBox virtual machine <body> How can I use external hard drive via USB connection on a virtual machine using VirtualBox?  I ejected the hard disk from OS X host, then the disk becomes available in OS X virtual machine.  Clicking on the disk throws an error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bm7J7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  USB Settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TdDif.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Why is that?  EDIT: I added external drive to the USB panel. I am still getting an error `Failed to attach the USB device Seagate Expansion to the virtual machine El Capitan3.  precodeFailed to create a proxy device for the USB device. (Error: VERR_PDM_NO_USB_PORTS).  Result Code: NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005) Component: ConsoleWrap Interface: IConsole {872da645-4a9b-1727-bee2-5585105b9eed} /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJSrO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer238848> I assume the you have downloaded and installed the "Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack". This enables support for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 devices, VirtualBox RDP and PXE boot for Intel cards.  In the Ports window pane, I do not see where you have added a USB Device Filter. Below is where I added a 2 GB USB flash drive.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ck6mP.png" alt="81"  An alternative to ejecting the USB external drive would be the following:  Unmount the USB drive before starting the virtual machine. The timing is very important, since OS X will try to remount the drive automatically. Use the Terminal application command  precodediskutil list /code/pre  to determine the identifier for the external USB drive. For example, say the identifier is codedisk1/code, then the command to execute, just before you start the virtual machine, would be  precodediskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1 /code/pre  h2Update:/h2  Actually, I was able to gain access to the USB flash drive after starting the virtual machine. All I had to do is execute the   precodediskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1 /code/pre  command while the virtual machine was running.  h2Accessing the External USB Drive as a Virtual SATA Drive/h2  The following Terminal application commands create the file codeshare.vmdk/code needed to access the external USB drive as a virtual SATA drive. This file will be stored in the folder named codeShare/code on the your Desktop. I assume the identifier of the external drive is codedisk1/code.  precodecd ~ cd Desktop mkdir Share cd Share diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1 sudo chmod go+rw /dev/disk1* diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1 vboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  "$PWD/share.vmdk"  -rawdisk  /dev/disk1 /code/pre  Note: The effects of the codesudo chmod go+rw /dev/disk1*/code command are temporary. The permissions may revert, if you restart the computer or eject the external USB drive.  You can now add the codeshare.vmdk/code file as a second drive in your virtual machine. emNote: Before clicking on the "Open" button, you will need to execute the command/em codediskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1/code.  Before starting the virtual machine, you will be required to execute the command codediskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1/code.     Note: You can stop OS X from automatically mounting the external USB drive by creating/editing the file code/etc/fstab/code. See codeman fstab/code for more information.   h2Accessing a Read/Write .dmg File as a Virtual SATA Drive/h2  Use the Disk Utility application to create a new blank disk image. Below is a example where the codeshare.dmg/code is created in the code~/Desktop/Share/code folder. (This was done using Yosemite OS X 10.10) Other types of disk images can also be created and used.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hrPta.png" alt="83"  Again you need to create a codeshare.vmdk/code file. The commands are given below.  precodecd ~/Desktop/Share diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1 vboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  "$PWD/share.vmdk"  -rawdisk  /dev/disk1 /code/pre  Next, execute the same steps already given to access the USB drive.  <comment292990> I added external harddrive in USB panel. I am still getting an error. Not I get it whenever I eject the external hardrive from host Mac. <comment292996> Do you get the message when you unmount the external drive instead of ejecting the drive? <comment292999> Doesn't matter. Happens regardless of which option I choose. <comment293001> You did not mention in your original post the guest was a virtual Hackinosh. I am not sure what happens when you try to run a operating systems on virtual hardware for which Apple neither designed or intended for anyone to do so. <comment293004> Yes, I am running El Capitan on El Capitan. Really unfortunate. no shared folders, no USB...seems like internet is the only option. <comment293015> BTW, I assume you did install the "VirtualBox 5.0.20 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack". This enables support for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 devices, VirtualBox RDP and PXE boot for Intel cards. <comment293034> There is a third option. You can share a unmounted dmg file as a second virtual SATA drive. Also, you can share the USB drive as a second virtual SATA drive. I updated my answer with the procedures. If just transferring data to the virtual machine, you can create an iso and insert into the virtual DVD drive.
