New 16GB iPhone 5s: Leave it on iOS 9 or upgrade to iOS 10? <body> Will I get more storage space with iOS 10? I was under the impression that iOS 10 was larger than iOS 9, but then I read this: http://bgr.com/2016/06/17/16gb-iphone-6s-ios-10/    <answer286777> It is strongly recommended to upgrade latest version of your ios device and also download any available update for your device for that go to setting- general - software update. Now 16gb iphone5 definately support ios 10 so go for upgrade your iphone.  <comment361964> I think the OP wants to know about storage space and iOS 10, not if their device is able to be upgraded.  Can you please [edit] your answer to address the OP's question? <comment361969> Yes, that's correct. I realize that it's best practice to always keep iOS up-to-date, but with this being a 16 GB iPhone, I don't have much storage space at all so I need to maximize it. Thanks.
