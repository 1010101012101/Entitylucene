Best practice to connect two monitors with my Macbook Pro <body> currently i am asking which is the best practice to connect two HDMI monitors on my Macbook Pro. I have on HDMI slot and one Display Port. It is possible to chain the monitors via one display port or i have to connect one via hdmi and one via the mini display port?  Thanks in advance.  <answer163435> You need to find DisplayPort to HDMI adaptor and connect one monitor over it and another one over HDMI.  Besides I wonder how exactly you gonna chain two HDMI monitors?  <answer163437> I use this DisplayPort to HDMI on my Mac Book Air (for $ 6)   Mini DisplayPort to HDMIÂ® Adapter w/ Audio Support  http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=104&amp;cp_id=10428&amp;cs_id=1042802&amp;p_id=5311&amp;seq=1&amp;format=1  and it works like a charm!  PS I do not think the daisy chain will work.  <comment191354> Thunderbolt can chain, everything else needs one monitor per port. <comment191774> It is not possible to chain two HDMI monitors via one HDMI adapter, only with DisplayPort this is possible. I have solve it with your solution. thanks!
