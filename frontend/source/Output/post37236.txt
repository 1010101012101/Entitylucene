File has different name in terminal and Finder <body> I've just downloaded the driver for my preferred trackball from Logitech. In the Finder, the Installer's filename is codeLogitech Control Center Installer.app/code. In the Terminal, codels/code shows codeLCC Installer.app/code. How did this happen?  <answer37237> One possible reason for a different name is if the package has a localized name. This allows the name displayed in the Finder to vary depending on the language of the user, and it also can be different than the "actual" name of the file, as displayed in Terminal.
