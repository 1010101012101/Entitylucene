Mac Finder not finding files that Spotlight does <body> Getting very odd behaviour from search in Finder (Sierra 10.12.15).  Searching for '102 Skills' in Finder does emnot/em reveal the files and emails that the same search in Spotlight does:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tcq0X.png" alt="&#39;102 Skills&#39; â€“ Finder and Spotlight windows"  But if I just search for '102' emor/em '102 Skills.' then the relevant files (and many others) are shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfUZ4.png" alt="enter image description here"  What's going on? Seems likely to be something specific to my machine, otherwise the forums would be littered with similar complaints (although there was a fairly similar (unanswered) question posted here before).  Should I rebuild the Spotlight index even though Spotlight seems to work just fine?
