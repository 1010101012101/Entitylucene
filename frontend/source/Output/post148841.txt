Scriptable menu bar icons <body> Is there an easy way I can add custom icons to the menu bar status area? Ideally something like Growl (e.g., where you can just execute a command) but instead of notifications, just renders icons in the menu bar.  I'm mainly looking to draw numbers that I'd use to alert me of various things. For example, I can configure my email client to run a command/AppleScript to update the numbers when an certain kind of email arrives.  Something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MUjW9.png" alt="img"  <answer152751> Yes, you can create a Cocoa app for this purpose in Xcode. No, you cannot do it with applescript.  <answer152792> I would suggest starting with this thread, which describes using Cocoa Objective-C calls from within AppleScript. There is an example Xcode project here.  And Launch is a complete application written in AppleScript that functionally does this. Its Xcode project file is here.  The basic premise is to generate NSMenuItem instances and add them to the system's NSStatusBar:  precodeset statusMenu to (NSMenu's alloc)'s initWithTitle_("Launch") -- (build and do stuff with the statusMenu here) set sysStatusBar to NSStatusBar's systemStatusBar set statusItem to sysStatusBar's statusItemWithLength_(32) tell statusItem to setMenu_(statusMenu) tell statusItem to setHighlightMode_(1) set menuImage to NSImage's imageNamed_("icon.png") tell statusItem to setImage_(menuImage) /code/pre  subemAppleScript excerpt from Launch's source code, Copyright &copy; Lee Hanken/em/sub  <answer152882>   You can also use RubyCocoa:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"coderequire "osx/cocoa" include OSX  app = NSApplication.sharedApplication statusitem = NSStatusBar.systemStatusBar().statusItemWithLength(NSVariableStatusItemLength) statusitem.setTitle("aa") app.run /code/pre  <answer154023> Another option is to use Rumps, a Python library that uses the Obj-C classes and functions.  http://rumps.readthedocs.org/en/latest/  <answer154661> Okay, I have made an app for this. It is on GitHub: 0942v8653/ScriptableStatusBar. Just keep the app running and use the codesbar/code tool to set and remove items.  As the readme says:  precodesbar set face  'Bye!:sbar remove face' /code/pre  Creates a face in the status bar. The menu will have an option codeBye!/code that runs codesbar remove face/code getting rid of the menu it creates.  hr  You can download a compiled version from https://github.com/0942v8653/ScriptableStatusBar/releases.  <comment181951> Nice, but why do You register to all distributed notifications instead of the one with name: "io.github.0942v8653.ScriptableStatusBar"? <comment181953> @MateuszSzlosek Good question. Will fix later :P <comment181975> @MateuszSzlosek Fixed.
