"First Aid found corruption that needs to be repaired" <body> I was trying to re-install Windows through Bootcamp, and it was stuck at partitioning. I quit Bootcamp, and now in the disk utility I get this error, even when in recovery mode:     First Aid found corruption that needs to be repaired. To repair the startup volume, run First Aid from Recovery   I am backing it up right now, but how can I fix this? It's my school computer with important stuff, so any help is appreciated. It's a MacBook Pro (Retina, Late 2013) running macOS Sierra.  <answer255670> Fixed my own problem:   I went into internet recovery mode (Cmd+Option+R) on startup and was able to repair the disk from disk utility inside of internet recovery. I guess it was cause recovery was on the disk I was trying to fix.  <comment318334> You need to provide us with more info. What model of MacBook are your running? What version of macOS is installed? And, what kind of drive does the MacBook have: SSD v HDD v Fusion/Hybrid?
