App Expose/Application Window Default Shortcut Across Different Versions <body> So I would like to know the default keyboard shortcut for Application Widow/App Expose from OSX from 10.6 - 10.12.  I have read it has changed.  <answer268816> So 10.6 uses the f10 key by default.  10.7 and later use the control + down arrow.  <comment337569> F3... it's printed on the key. <comment337582> @Tetsujin I believe F3 is just regular expose and not app expose.  Also for which Operating System 10.6 or 10.7?  I'm fairly certain 10.7 is correct although I don't have the Operating System in front of me. <comment337584> I'm pretty sure they gave up with "Expos√©" a while ago, now all you have is "Mission Control", on F3 by default [I don't have anything older than El Cap I can check on... & there's no way I'm going to hit 'Restore Defaults' to find out] <comment337585> @Tetsujin hmm you may be right.  Do you mind going to this screen and seeing if this option does anything http://cdn.iphonehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mission-control-settings-el-capitan.png I see options like this on google and it makes me think it isn't gone http://www.tweaking4all.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/macosx-mission-control-open.jpg  maybe they have renamed it to mission control.  What does f4 do then? <comment337586> This is [regular expose](http://www4.pcmag.com/media/images/211911-apple-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard-expose-from-dock.jpg) and this is [app expose](https://basshead.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/dock-expose.jpg) in 10.6 at least <comment337592> Yeah, sorry... doesn't exist any more, can't test. 1st link, option is still there, never tried it tbh. 2nd link, idk what the pic is telling me. https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/un-group-mission-control-windows-for-quicker-window-switching has something on i.
