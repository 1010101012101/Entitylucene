Do web launch apps conform to Apple iOS App Store / Google Play App store <body> Does some know, if apps, which immediately after launch opens a system browser window, conform to App Store / Play Store guidelines?  Or does an app need to show a screen and wait for users to take action?  <answer131188> There isn't an explicit rules in Apple's review guidelines for the App Store.   But it seems to be that Apple would reject an app which would only open the navigator :     Apple rejects applications that do not:      have a user experience that feels like an "app" feel "at home" in the   iOS ecosystem offer a differentiation from a mobile web experience   From : PhoneGap advice on dealing with Apple application rejections  So I would strongly suggest using an UIWebView.  <comment154016> Why not use an internal Webview ? <comment154017> Would be an option, yes. <comment154049> You might not even be able to use just a webview—[App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html) §2.12 says "Apps that are not very useful, unique, are simply web sites bundled as Apps, or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejected" <comment154215> @0942v8653 Thank you very much for a valuable comment!
