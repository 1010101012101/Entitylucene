How can I update my version of `unzip` to version 6.00 or higher? <body> Its a common problem that, when unzipping (read: 'open by double-click'), some code.zip/code files result in a similar sized code.cpgz/code file. But you expected an unzipped file or folder instead.  The default unzip program in OS X is '/System/Library/CoreServices/Archive Utility.app'  When you try to unzip it in the Terminal (code/usr/bin/unzip/code) you see the following:  precode$ unzip SE.zip  Archive:  SE.zip warning [SE.zip]:  zipfile claims to be last disk of a multi-part archive;   attempting to process anyway, assuming all parts have been concatenated   together in order.  Expect "errors" and warnings...true multi-part support   doesn't exist yet (coming soon). error [SE.zip]:  missing 8256083459 bytes in zipfile   (attempting to process anyway) error [SE.zip]:  attempt to seek before beginning of zipfile   (please check that you have transferred or created the zipfile in the   appropriate BINARY mode and that you have compiled UnZip properly) /code/pre  I have Mavericks 10.9.5 running, and a codeunzip -v/code learns us we are on version 5.52:  precode$ unzip -v UnZip 5.52 of 28 February 2005, by Info-ZIP.

There is no error and the file seems fine. My CentOS system runs unzip version 6.00:  precode$ unzip -v UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Info-ZIP.  Maintained by C. Spieler.

And affiliated question: Will my new version of OS X unzip also have affect on the default unzip 'Archive Utility.app'?  ps. emI prefer the use of a package manager like codebrew/code above compiling from source. codebrew install unzip/code results in: codeError: No available formula for unzip/code/em  <answer149088> Using Homebrew (as requested):  precode$ brew tap homebrew/dupes $ brew install unzip /code/pre  This will install unzip at (considering defaults) code/usr/local/Cellar/unzip/6.0/bin/unzip/code  You can then alias it as codeunzip6/code somewhere in your path.  Also, you may want to to try "The Unarchiver" from the app store. Much more useful IMO then Apple's Archive Utility.  <answer218339> You may find that p7zip does what you want. Use codebrew install p7zip/code to install, then run code7z -h/code to get some help.  I'm using code7z t/code on a 20GB zipfile as I write this, to test its integrity. Both Unzip 5.52 and Unzip 6.0 choked on it.  <comment175603> Use macports it does have unzip version 6.0 :) <comment175604> ha ha brew vs. macports... I have my system already marinaded with brew. But mightbe I can check the source. Thanks anyway! <comment175610> I was missing the `brew tap homebrew/dupes`. No clue what is does but now I *can* do a brew install unzip. thnx a bunch. <comment175611> Although I now have a working unzip 6.0.0, just like I wanted, now I have a new error. Mightbe you can help me with it, but it is beyond this topic. `skipping: foobar  need PK compat. v4.5 (can do v2.1)` for each file in the zip. <comment175612> Can't solve the problem, though my guess is the file was zipped using PKZip and it did something... *unique* <comment175613> BTW the tap command opens up new apps in brew that are left out of the default for various reasons (specifically is adds new specific homebrew git repo's). This includes things like `dupes`, `games`, and `php` etc. <comment277960> In case anyone gets to this page because they're getting an error unzipping large zip files, go with The Unarchiver in the link. Worked for me. <comment291847> Yes! E.g. p7zip works very nicely to uncompress Microsoft's IE VM images, which are 5 GB+.
