How can I print a PDF/X Mavericks document? <body> A few iterations ago, Mac OS X had a "Save as PDF-X" option available via the print dialogue, with an associated file at /Library/PDF Services/Save As PDF-X.workflow that handled the magic suff I assume.  My understanding is that the PDF/X format embeds fonts and does other "preflight" stuff to make a document good for printshops to use. Outputting in this format is possible with Illustrator and other Adobe products, but I would produce a printshop-ready PDF/X file using software I already have (LibreOffice, Word, etc.)  In Mac OS X 10.9, this "Save as PDF-X" option is nowhere I can find.  Is there any simple way to create PDF/X format files?  https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=PDF/X  Back in 2010, Philip Regan gave some info about doing it with the then present "Save as PDF-X" feature, but it is no longer part of the print dialogue. How can I print a PDF X-1A from a iWork Pages document?  Anyone have any ideas?  <answer159591> Create an Automator print plugin that prints as a PDF-X.  Open Automator.app  Select "strongPrint Plugin/strong" at the emChoose a type for your document/em screen  Select "strongPDF/strong" from the emActions/em menu  Drag "strongApple Quartz Filter to the PDF Documents/strong" to the workflow space on the right  When prompted choose if you want to create a copy of the original, add or don't add  In the Apply Quartz Filter to PDF Documents workflow, in the strongFilter/strong dropdown, choose "emCreate Generic PDFX-3 Document/em".  Choose File--Save  Name whatever you like (PDFX)  This will add a workflow back that allows for PDFX again. The workflow is saved in your user directory ~/Library/PDF Services/  <comment187604> To nitpick a bit, it might be a better choice to create a PDF/X1-a document; this is the only PDF/X format which does not leave anything to interpretation. <comment187664> @max-wyss, Do you know how to cread a x-1a workflow? Automator seems to only have x-3. <comment187715> Sounds like a lack among those Quartz filters. You might do better using Acrobat and the Preflight plug-in and create a Preflight Droplet.
