How do I display a hyperlink with an AppleScript? <body> I am trying to get a URL via AppleScript, then displaying it as a clickable link via a window. How do I do this? (if I need to use Xcode for this, please add the answer, but provide detailed instructions, emplease/em)  <answer50397> precodetell application "Safari" to display dialog URL of document 1 as string /code/pre  Or  precodeset theUrl to "http://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/50397" display dialog theUrl /code/pre  <answer51840> AppleScript itself cannot display rich text (HTML) in a popup dialog. So your options are:  ol liDisplay a normal text dialog with AppleScript, showing the URL and asking the user if she wants to go there. If user clicks "OK", open that URL (that's exactly 1 click, so pretty much equivalent to a clickable link).  precode-- tested with Safari 5.1.7 on Mac OS X 10.6.8 set theUrl to "http://j.mp/LgHoEB" try     display dialog theUrl &amp; "\nClick OK to open this URL in Safari." with title "Open URL?" with icon caution     if button returned of result is "OK" then         tell application "Safari" to make new document with properties {URL:theUrl}     end if on error number -128 -- user cancelled     -- do something else end try /code/pre  &nbsp; /li liUse the Safari AppleScript command codedo JavaScript/code to make a JavaScript popup with the desired URL as a clickable link (and possibly some more custom HTML):  precode-- tested with Safari 5.1.7 on Mac OS X 10.6.8 set theUrl to "http://j.mp/LgHoEB" set JSPopup to "(function() {" &amp; ¬     "var w = window.open('', 'Clickable link');" &amp; ¬     "w.document.write(" &amp; ¬     "'&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;" &amp; ¬     "&lt;a href=\"" &amp; theUrl &amp; "\"&gt;" &amp; theUrl &amp; "&lt;/a&gt;" &amp; ¬     "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;'" &amp; ¬     ");})()" tell application "Safari"     do JavaScript JSPopup in current tab of window 1 end tell /code/pre  Of course, this will only work if your Safari allows popup windows (with my settings, for instance, a new tab is opened instead)./li /ol  <comment57817> See my updated question...the link needs to be clickable.
