How to set home network on iPhone when using Gevey card? <body> I unlocked the phone with a Gevey SIM card, but when I want to use 3G I have to set Data Roaming to ON, because the cell network is not recognized as home network. But this is not the solution, as I can accidentally forget to turn it off when traveling abroad.   So the question is, how can I set the home network for my iPhone so that I could have my Data Roaming option set to OFF ?
