iOS 7 Siri US voice quality sounds like iOS 6? <body> So this is weird. My phone was jailbroken few days ago but I messed it up so I had to restore. But when I activate Siri, the quality sounds like the one in iOS 6?? And Siri doesn't sound very fun now... I didn't have this problem before I jailbroke it, so could it be because of the jailbreak??  I checked through the Settings and the voice language is in United States.  For example, when I say "ha ha ha", Siri would respond with "I make you laugh?". Instead of using realistic and clear human voice, the voice sounds like a stern robot.  <comment135917> Curious. I wonder if Siri is just getting bored with that trick? <comment136017> No.... the voice is like that all the time now. <comment136087> @MegaRodeon Jailbreaking doesn't change anything like that inherently. A jailbreak tweak could very well have changed it, though. <comment136108> Is it? Then are there any methods to reset Siri? Or simply turn off and start Siri again?
