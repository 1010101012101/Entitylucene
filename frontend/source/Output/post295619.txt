What is a good model Mac to get? <body> I was wondering what people with new Mac or any Mac really thinks is an adequate mac to buy for design/3D use. I work as a designer and have for the last 10 years. I'm leaving my job soon and just realized that my mac is 5 years old and was thinking that maybe I should get something a little newer/more powerful although I may not need it. I have a few friends that have the newest Mac and they really don't like it. So my question is really, would you guys buy a new Mac or opt for something slightly older?  <comment373359> What about new Mac do they dislike?  The Mac itself or the operating system?  Do you know what Mac they have?  iMac, Laptop,...
