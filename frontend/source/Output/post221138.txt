Change keyboard layout permanently <body> I want to permanently change my keyboard layout. Every time I restart my computer, I have to add Spanish ISO layout and delete the US one.   My Macbook has a spanish keyboard but I use OSx in english.  <answer221166> You can rearrange the languages from System Preferences  Languages. Don't delete English but put Spanish ISO first. I've it like that and the config sticks through restarts and the like.  <comment267785> The OQ is about the keyboard layout, not the language used by the system. <comment267816> If he puts Spanish first in the Language list, his OS will be in Spanish, but he wants it in English. <comment267817> I will check tomorrow how exactly I have it setup, but I have the OS in English and the Keyboard in Spanish ISO with no problems. Sorry for the misguiding of my answer, I promise to share a better one tomorrow. <comment270409> I can't rearrange the input source, english is always first
