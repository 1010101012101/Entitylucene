Can I keep apple appstore revenue with apple for longer time? <body> I would like to know weather I can keep my appstore revenue with apple and withdraw whenever I like..?  <answer178890> Yes, you will not lose the revenue from not withdrawing it. It will stay against your account as long as your account remains active.   <comment212113> Mitch, I have a couple of apps in appstore, apple sends the full money every month..how to tell them to send only a part of it and keep the rest with them..?
