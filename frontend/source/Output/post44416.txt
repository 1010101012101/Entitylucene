Extract a disk image without diskimagemounter <body> I have an account on a school system where they won't allow us to mount virtual images. I can run arbitrary programs as a user, though not as root. I've tried mounting it from the command line using diskutil and hdiutil (or somethings like that), and I have an application to convert it between .iso, .cdr, .dmg, and .img. I don't want to have to use Disk Utility to burn it to a CD each time to open it and don't want to need additional hardware (i.e. a CD-R or flash drive). I just want to get files off it. The particular image is Chrome for Mac.  <answer44428> Pacifist allows you to examine the contents of packages and archives, including .dmg files, and extract individual files. Unfortunately,  it may require you to authenticate as an Administrator to do so.  I would advocate caution in proceeding. Be certain you're not circumventing the strongemintentions/em/strong of your school's system administrators even if your actions are seemingly emallowed/em based on the restrictions imposed.  <comment50974> Yep, and it doesn't even come in a DMG! :D <comment50975> Oh, and they state that their intentions are to prevent us from disabling their filters which keep out pornography and illegal content, which I won't be participating in. The main use is for Steam, Chrome, Adium, the like <comment50985> Aw, I tried it and it still gave me the popup requiring an administration password to open disk images. :( Thanks for the try, though. <comment50986> Sorry it didn't work for you. <comment50996> It's fine. I probably shouldn't be doing this in theory anyways, but really don't like using an archaic form of firefox (or safari) <comment50998> @Andrew Safari and Chrome are based on the same rendering engine **WebKit**. Safari also offers the Web Inspector. Why would you prefer Chrome? <comment51009> I am fine with WebKit, I just don't like the fact that the forms on the school computers can't be updated - both Firefox and Safari are at version 4 ATM, which isn't that archaic but means there are security flaws I don't want to deal with. I prefer Chrome and Firefox to Safari anyways because of the sync features.
