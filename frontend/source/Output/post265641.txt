Connect the old iPhone to a power source and turn on Wi-Fi. 2. On the old iPhone - assuming you're running iOS 8 or later - tap Settings  iCloud  Backup. The Backup switch is near the bottom of the large group of controls. (On iOS 7 or earlier, you should tap Settings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup.) 3. Make sure iCloud Backup is turned on.  ol start="4" liTap Back Up Now, and wait for the backup process to complete.
