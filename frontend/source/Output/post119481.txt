Safari list of closed sessions feature <body> I don't use Safari that often but I remember this really nice feature where you could scroll through a list of previously closed sessions. I think it was located on the "Top Sites" page that Safari features. Now I can't find it, so I'm guessing either it was erased in an update or moved somewhere. Is there a way to access this list of closed sessions?   <answer119496> It is still there and it looks like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uXXbR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Under the History Tab - Show Top Sites  in my Safari 6.0.5  <comment139375> What version of Safari do you have? <comment139410> @Buscarì›ƒ Safari 6.1.1 <comment139411> No it's different from history, because I remember when my history was deleted I found that all my closed sessions could be scrolled through and organized by date.
