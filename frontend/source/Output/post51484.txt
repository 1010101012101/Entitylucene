Install OS X in VirtualBox on iMac? <body> Is it possible to install OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard in VirtualBox on an iMac (i3) running OS X 10.6.8? I have the 10.6 install CD, DMG, and ISO, but can't get any of them to boot from VirtualBox.  <answer51488> These instructions are for VirtualBox on Windows and Linux but they work well on OS X as well. Taken from here -- abridged and modified for OS X guest OS:  ul liRip your original retail DVD of Snow Leopard in ISO format./li liIn VirtualBox, create a new virtual machine. Name it as you want, but select "Mac OS X" as the operating system, and "Mac OS X Server" as the version. Click next. Assign a good amount of RAM to the VM. I chose 1024 MB. Click next. Create a new virtual hard disk, I chose 20 GB of dynamically expanding storage. Click finish./li liOpen the settings for this new virtual machine, and in the Storage section, load the Snow Leopard ISO in the now empty CD/DVD device./li liNow close VirtualBox (important!). Find the XML file that defines the virtual machine that you just created. This will be in code~/Library/VirtualBox/Machines/&lt;name of the VM&gt;/&lt;name of the VM&gt;.xml/code. Search this file in a text edit for the codeExtraDataItem/code tags. After the last instance of codeExtraDataItem/code tags add the following two, new, codeExtraDataItem/code tags:  &lt;ExtraDataItem name="VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs" value=" "/  &lt;ExtraDataItem name="VBoxInternal2/SmcDeviceKey" value="ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal(c)AppleComputerInc"//li liSave and close the file./li liOpen VirtualBox and power on the virtual machine. The installation will start after some minutes. Choose your language. Now open Disk Utility under Utilities menu. Select the virtual disk and click Erase. Close it and you can now install OSX. Before that, you can choose to customize the installation. It can be interesting to disable extra language translations or printer support (you save about 2 GB)./li /ul  <answer54341> I have a SL 10.6.8 VBox running as we speak. It works perfectly, if a bit slowly. I'm about to abandon it for reasons totally unrelated to VirtualBox, but let's see if I can remember everything I did to get it running:  1) Like the other answer said, start with a rip of an original SL DVD. Mine was 10.6.0.  2) Also like the other answer, create the new VM, select Mac OS X Server (even if you're not using Server), assign = 1GB of RAM (I'd give it at least 2GB if you can spare it), and mount your ripped DVD.  3) Don't start the machine.  4) Open up the machine settings and make sure all of the following are set:  System  Motherboard  Chipset: ICH9  System  Motherboard  Extended Features  Enable IO APIC (checked)  System  Motherboard  Extended Features  Enable EFI (checked)  System  Processor  Enable PAE/NX (checked)  System  Acceleration  Enable VT-x/AMD-V (checked)  System  Acceleration  Enable Nested Paging (checked)  Storage  Here make sure the hard disk is attached to a SATA Controller of type AHCI.  Network  Adapter 1 (or any other)  Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 T Server (82543GC)  Ports  Serial Ports  Enable Serial Port (uncheck this)  Ports  USB  Enable USB Controller (checked)  Ports  USB  Enable USB 2.0 (checked)  5) Start the machine and you should see the verbose boot mode (no gray Apple screen).  6) Proceed with OS X install.  This is exactly what I did and have running now. Updated 10.6.0 to 10.6.8 using standard Software Update. No patches, kexts or other hacks required.  My System: iMac 21.5" Late 2009 (3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, with 16GB RAM)  VirtualBox version: 4.1.12 r77245 with extensions installed.  I tried updating VirtualBox to 4.1.14, but that broke this VM somehow. Never quite figured out why, but that kept me from updating. Haven't tried 4.1.16 yet. If you can't it to install on the current version with these settings, maybe this is why?  Hope that helps!  <answer120175> I have an old macbook(white 13"). I could not update to Mavericks via AppStore because of my hardware(would not allow me to download). Currently on 10.6.8  I installed latest version of virtualbox(4.3.6). I found 10.8.5 installesd.iso on web(don't recall where). Pretty much all default settings(40GB static HD in .vdi format, 2GB RAM, 128MB video memory). In the settings, the default controller is SATA, which worked for me. I added the installesd.iso to the virtual DVD drive and started the machine. Machine starts and you will see verbage for a couple of minutes, then you will get to the options screen of the install disk. Select "disk utility". In "disk utility" select the virtual HDD you have for the machine(the one at the very top of the list). Select "partition"- 1 partition- mac os extended(journaled) and click "partition" to partition the disk. Exit disk utility, then select re-install osx. Select your virtual HDD and install.  Took fooooorrrrrrrreeeevvvvvveerrrrrrrrr! Said install of 20 min. Was more like 45 min. If screen goes white during install, it is just idle screen. Click back in machine window and it should show you current install status. Create acount as you would typically for mac and start using your mac.  I can now upgrade my VM to Mavericks(currently downloading) on the bare metal that i could not upgrade.  <comment58848> Note: only the server version of Snow Leopard is allowed to be virtualized. Virtualizing the non-Server 10.6.x version violates the EULA. <comment58849> Ah, thanks Ian, didn't know that. <comment58854> I'm not having any luck finding the .XML file. There is no Machines folder in ~/Library/VirtualBox/, nor can Finder find OSX.xml on the HDD. All I can find is /VirtualBox VMs/OSX/ in my home/user folder with .vbox, .vbox-prev, and .vhd <comment58856> I do see VirtualBox.xml in ~/Library/VirtualBox/ which does have ExtraDataItem stuff in it. Should I put it there? <comment58859> No luck on that either, just FYI. <comment58860> @David that's a bummer. I haven't tried this in a very long time so VirtualBox may have moved on. :( <comment62190> There are websites that host entire pre bundled virtual box images that completely save you from having to go through any kind of install/setup of the vm <comment125031> This works for me. The crucial bit is to add in the `ExtraDataItem` xml tag, right after `Machine` tag  ```VirtualBox ...   Machine uuid="..." name="OS X Mavericks" ...   ExtraData       ExtraDataItem name="VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs" value=" "/       ExtraDataItem name="VBoxInternal2/SmcDeviceKey" value="ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal(c)AppleComputerInc"/   /ExtraData ```  Newer versions of VirtualBox store your VM at `/Users/user/VirtualBox VMs/vm name/vm name.vbox`  Tip: backup before making changes. <comment151669> I couldn’t get VirtualBox to boot from a .dmg file I made from the Snow Leopard install disc. The VM successfully booted from the disc after a few minutes, after I made these changes: increasing Display  Video Memory from 6 MB to 128 MB, enabling 3D Acceleration, telling VirtualBox to populate the CD/DVD drive with my host drive (real physical drive) instead of a virtual disk file of the DMG, leaving out the `EfiBootArgs` `ExtraDataItem` tag, and adding `ExtraDataItem name="VBoxInternal2/EfiGopMode" value="4"/` (which just changes the screen resolution from 1027×768 to 1440×900). <comment171077> @XAleXOwnZX if this is still true can you list some? <comment171101> Google "virtual box images" <comment242400> It appears that the .vbox files are the xml files you need.
