How to make it clear that a value is being changed using keynote <body> I am using keynote to make a presentation.  Let's say that following 3 lines. And the third line is something like  ul liWe are opening a section for kids/li liIn June use 20% discout on all kids items/li liOn all kids items 30 days money back guarantee/li /ul  Next I want this to happen.  ul liWhen I hit next then a big "X" come over slowly on "20%" /li liWhen I hit next then I want "20%" to be replaced by "40%"/li /ul  How do I do that in keynote. I just purchased keynote so I am using the latest version.  <answer14130> Use the emInspector/em tool to add build-in and build-out transition to your texts and cross.    You'll have 4 build order steps :    ol licross fade in /li licross disappear/li litext "20%" disappear/li litext "40%" appear/li /ol  Play with duration and 'start build' settings to obtain desired effect.br See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X-5AizWIJE for a screencast ;)  <comment15228> That's super slick. Dude I owe you a beer. Lemme know if you are ever in Miami area. :-)
