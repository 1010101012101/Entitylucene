iTunes folder contains duplicated music files <body> On my macOSX I'm using standard Music folder that contains following folders with music and iTunes folder.  precodeMusic |- Artists |- Compilations |- iTunes /code/pre  I have imported codeArtists/code and codeCompilations/code into iTunes using "Add to Library". Now codeMusic/iTunes/iTunes Media/code contains the same mp3 files as Artists and Compilations.   Is it possible import folder into iTunes without duplicating it?  <answer286921> Unchecking codeCopy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library/code in codeiTunes -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Advanced/code img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7XOA1.png" alt="enter image description here"
