Cannot share clipboard when using Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection to Windows7 <body> I use Remote Desktop Connection on my 10.6.2 to connect to Windows XP and Windows7. I can share clipboard between mac and Windows XP but Windows7.  Any idea how to make it work for Windows 7?  It seems to me that it work sometimes. Not sure when and why.  <answer65290> You should try to make sure the process coderdpclip.exe/code is running in your Windows 7 box.br If it is, try killing it and restarting it.  This process transfers the clipboard contents over RDP.  <answer91482> Batch this, and use it in a CMD file,  Make a program Group / Desktop link to the batch for Citrix PS users,  or even better, use VBS to do the task and Link it to the Desktop:  %SystemRoot%\system32\Taskkill.exe /im rdpclip.exe /f /t  %SystemRoot%\system32\rdpclip.exe  <answer112207> Open task manager on the remote desktop . In the Process tab , you will find process rdpclip.exe . Right click and select "end process" . Search for executable rdpclip.exe in your system and run it . This solved the copy/paste problem for me .  <answer227729> I had the same problem in my Mac and as I noticed in RDP connected windows os appeared "attached drive" in section "Devices and drives". So that was the only thing for me to copy files from OSX to WIN through RDP client.  You have to edit desired connection and under the tab redirection you have to specify folder to redirect. soon after you start modified remote connection you will see new folder under the device and drivers in This PC  <answer227910> Something I found on the Windows forums is to enable all of the drives as local resources (check the box labeled "Drives") when you connect to the remote machine. This allows me to copy and paste now.  <answer274338> Be sure to use kbdCTRL/kbd + kbdV/kbd to paste in Windows, not kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdV/kbd.  <comment76899> I restart the box basically every day. Strange thing is that sometimes copying things over RDP works, sometimes not. <comment139020> I didn't have to restart it after killing the process, it just restarted by itself after reconnecting to the RDP. <comment200822> Killing `rdpclip.exe` and re-running it worked for me!
