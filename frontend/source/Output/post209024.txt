How do I tell OS X to never include certain folders in Recent Places on Open/Save dialogs? <body> When I tried to save a document I noticed a recent section and folders listed I don't want people to see.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/efU4L.png" alt="enter image description here"  How I can either get OS X to never add these to Recent Places, or if that's not possible then turn off Recent Places period?  <answer209027> You cannot do it on a per directory basis. What you can do is:  ol liClear the current list with the following command in Terminal:br / br / codedefaults delete -g NSNavRecentPlaces/codebr / br / Then repeat it each time you want the list to be cleared./li liDisable saving the Recent Places history completely with:br / br / codedefaults write -g NSNavRecentPlacesLimit -int 0/code/li /ol
