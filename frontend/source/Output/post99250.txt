Malware? .systemRootModeFile in ~/users/me/library <body> Non-techie person asks:  There is a code.systemRootModeFile/code in code~/users/me/library/code.  Is it malware, something horrible?  In the hidden library folder in code~/users/me/code I have a folder named code.f5cd/code. Inside that is a folder hierarchy of code.java/.systemPrefs/_!%.../code - the last one being a string of about 25 characters - and the folder name is in bold.  Inside that is a file codeprefs.xml/code  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE map SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd"&gt; &lt;map MAP_XML_VERSION="1.0"&gt;   &lt;entry key="EXPDATE" value="4994"/&gt;   &lt;entry key="REGVER" value="2"/&gt; &lt;/map&gt; /code/pre  and also within the code.systemPrefs/code folder are two more files code.system.lock/code and code.systemRootModFile/code.  <answer99260> .systemRootModFile and the other files you mentioned are part of Java system preferences and are safe. See this thread.  <comment116684> For a non-techie person you dig deep :)...what does your virus scanner says? <comment116686> FYI, `~` means your Home folder (`/Users/me/`) so `~/Users/me/Library` actually means `/Users/me/Users/me/Library` :) `~/Library` refers to your Library folder in your Home folder, and so does `/Users/me/Library`, however combining `~` with `/Users/me/Library` refers to a completely different folder :) <comment116687> @grgarside Thanks for the ~ explanation <comment116689> It says it is your JAVA preferences file. the Link will get you to Oracle download. <comment116691> Do you have something similar in your system - particularly the .systemRootModFile  file? <comment116697> WHat java programs have you installed - as they can implement the preferencesFactory in several ways
