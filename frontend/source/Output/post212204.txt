Disable alert e-mails from Mail / Calendar <body> I recently got a Macbook Pro for work, and am pretty new to the platform. One of the annoying things I noticed, is that after I configured all of my Gmail accounts, I started automatically getting these "alert" e-mails for calendar appointments.  I don't want Mail or Calendar to send me alert e-mails, because I already get them directly from Google.   My question is: How can I disable these alert e-mails from occurring?  <answer212241> It's Gmail [or rather Google Calendar] that sends the annoying emails, not Apple Mail/Calendar itself.    Try https://calendar.google.com/ &amp; change your settings per calendar via 'Edit notifications'...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5k13.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rTf1u.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer273404> It is indeed Mac Calendar problem as author of the question suggested.   I faced the same issue and observed that I get these nasty "emAlert - .../em" emails only when Mac wakes up. I also did not get them before I started using my Mac.  To solve the problem on macOS 10.12.3:  ul liOpen Calendar app/li liFind your Google calendar on the list and right mouse click it/li liSelect "strongGet Info/strong" option from the context menu/li liMark "strongIgnore alerts/strong" checkbox in the popup window (see screenshot). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PwQb1.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul
