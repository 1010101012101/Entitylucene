Is there any way to run Network Link Condition from a Standard User account? <body> There is a known issue in Network Link Conditioner where if you install it in the normal way (Xcode  Open Developer Tool  More Developer Tools  Install Hardware Tools) it will run from an Admin account but crash in a Standard account.  For increased security, I develop from a Standard account. Is there any way to run Network Link Condition from my standard account without switching to the Admin account?

To do so use the following shell command:   precodesudo /Applications/System\ Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/System\ Preferences /code/pre  or the following AppleScript command:   precodedo shell script "/Applications/System\ Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/System\ Preferences" with administrator privileges  /code/pre  When I click on the Network Link Conditioner in the window that is opened after the password is given, I get a message that System Preferences needs to be restartet to open the PrefPane. After agreeing to this the Network Link Conditioner is working for me while I'm logged in as normal (non-admin) user in 10.10.
