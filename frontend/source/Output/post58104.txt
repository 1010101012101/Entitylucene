How to change the list of file types which Safari will open immediately after download? <body> I would like to change Safari Safe List of type files which open immediately after download. Any ideas how?  <answer58177> One way is to use Hazel. I tried using it and it worked smoothly. However, Hazel isn't free ($25).  The second solution is to use Automator which is part of Mac OS X.  However, using Automator didn't quite work. Some of the mp4 files did open, but for unknown reason some didn't.  Also I'm not sure if Automator has to open the files as soon as they are downloaded, or there is a time frame which it could take to open them. Maybe some one more experiences with Automator could elaborate on this.   Here is a how to create and use an AppleScript to open .lyx files:  Open AppleScript file named codeaddSafariSafeList.scpt/code:  precodeproperty auto_open_extension_list : {"lyx"}  on adding folder items to thisFolder after receiving addedItems     tell application "Finder"         repeat with addedItem in addedItems             if name extension of addedItem is in auto_open_extension_list then                 my openFile(addedItem)             end if         end repeat     end tell end adding folder items to  on openFile(f) tell application "Finder"         open f      end tell end openFile /code/pre  copy the file to code~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/code  Note: I didn't have this folder, so I created both code~/Library/Scripts/code and code~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/code  Now, go to code~//code in Finder, right click on Downloads folder, click codeFolder Action Setup. . ./code  List should appear and contain codeaddSafariSafeList.scpt/code  Now you're good to go - whenever you'll download lyx file it should open automatically when ever you download it.  NOTE: If you want to open another file type, simply change codeproperty auto_open_extension_list : {"FileExtensionHere"}/code  NOTE II: If you want several types use: codeauto_open_extension_list : {"FileExtension1Here", "FileExtension2Here"}/code  Enjoy!  <answer73969> Or just stop Safari from opening ANY files automatically by Preferences  General last checkbox "Open "Safe" files after downloading"...
