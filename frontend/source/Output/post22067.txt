Can I encrypt an external harddisk which is in HFS+? <body> strongem(journaled, encrypted)/em/strong is a new option which I am able to find in Lion.   Can I convert an existing harddrive (external) to encrypt the whole drive instead of using other tools ?  <answer22087> Whole disks, no, but partitions, yes. While the Disk Utility GUI application cannot, the codediskutil/code command-line utility can do this.  First, come up with a password (such as codemyVerySecurePassword/code). I believe this is emnot/em tied to your login password, unlike encrypting the boot volume.  Then, find out the identifier for the target volume, e.g. codedisk1s1/code:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  Then, use codediskutil cs convert/code, like so:  precodediskutil cs convert disk1s1 -passphrase myVerySecurePassword /code/pre  <comment24377> Within Disk Utility you now have encrypted as an option when you erase a partition, but this won't help if you wish to preserve data and convert a drive in use.  If you are unhappy with command line tools, you can backup your data, format with encryption via Diam Manager, then restore into it. <comment24389> Similar question answered in another discussion.  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19918/how-to-create-an-encrypted-volume-on-an-external-drive-or-flash-drive/19920#19920 <comment24397> For 99.9% of the population, trying to distinguish 'whole disk' vs 'partition' is pointlessly pedantic and confusing.  To take it to the extreme, nothing using off-the-shelf drives is 'whole disk'. <comment24400> This question is to do it w/o **formatting** the disk <comment24517> I had originally left that first sentence out. Given the asker's mentioning of encryption, journaling, Disk Utility, etc., I wouldn't classify him as the average user who may not understand the concepts of having multiple volumes on one disk, so I figured I'd mention it. <comment27230> @zzz also note that stackexchange's *primary* target groups are power users, serious hobbyists and professionals, not the three nines of population :-) @SÃ¶ren great info! I found out it was impossible to create both encrypted and non-encrypted partitions onto the same disk with Disk Utility.app, but with `diskutil` it was possible. NB: just *having* an encrypted partition on a disk disables the partition tools of the graphical Disk Utility for the disk.
