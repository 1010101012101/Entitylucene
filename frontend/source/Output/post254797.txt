How do I preserve hyperlinks when I save word files (office for Mac) as PDFs? <body> I create a file on office for Mac and save as a pdf file, but ending with losing hyperlinks.   strongHow do I preserve hyperlinks when I save word files (office for Mac) as PDFs?/strong  I also tried Acrobat DC, Create a PDF, but failed to do that because of,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R2wuJ.png" width="400"  codeCompile error in hidden module:link/code is caused by conflicts of the template codelinkcreation.dotm/code that is from Adobe.  Removing codelinkcreation.dotm/code (the full path is code~/Users/(name)/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/user content/startup/Word/linkCreation.dotm/code) will track this issue.  But the hyperlinks are still not working.  <comment317409> The PDFMaker functionality on Mac is not very well developed (according to Adobe, they can not make as much as on Windows). That's why you may  not get the hyperlinks through. If there is no better solution, you might look at a detour via OpenOffice/LibreOffice.
