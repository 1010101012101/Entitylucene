Unable to install Boot Camp 6 Update for Windows 10 due an invalid signature <body> I previously upgraded to Windows 10 on my MacBook Pro (Mid 2012)'s Windows (former W7) Partition. Sadly I'm unable to install the BootCamp 6 update - it fails during the installation. Following error message pops up:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tg1Mw.jpg" alt="Error Message 1: &quot;Errors occured while installing the updates. If the problem persists, choose Tools - Download Only and try installing manually&quot; "  If I do so, following message shows up:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1dVWB.jpg" alt="Error Message 2: &quot;Boot Camp 6 Update for Windwos 10 has an invalid signature. The download has been removed.&quot;"  I couldn't find any Boot Camp 6 installer online... Neither a possibility to update Boot Camp on my OSX El Capitan Partition?   Any solution to fix this problem?   <answer212111> Found that enabling developer mode under "Update &amp; Security" in the system settings allowed the Boot Camp 6 update to install with no issue.  <comment256145> awesome! This worked for me. I would have never guessed that...
