How can I reset the camera roll to photo IMG_0001.jpg on iOS? <body> I just restored an iPhone 5 backup to an iPod touch emboth on iOS 6.1.3 (10B329)/em to rapidly load every app and setting, yet I'd really like the camera roll to start over with 0001.  I've gone in and deleted all the photos that restored onto the iPad using Image Capture, but the counter is stored on the device in a manner I can't figure out how to access  Is there a way to clear this counter and get the next photo I take to be IMG_0001.jpg without needing to erase all content and settings and start without restoring the backup?  <answer88287> With an Application such as iExplorer navigate to codePhotoData / MISC/code where you'll find a file called codeDCIM_APPLE.plist/code which contains the following:  precode&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;DCIMLastDirectoryNumber&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;100&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;DCIMLastFileNumber&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;251&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  The strongDCIMLastFileNumber/strong parameter is quite self explanatory. Set the number at which you want the counter to start at and restart the iPhone to apply the changes.   <comment103280> Would jailbreaking be an option for you here? <comment103327> It would be a last resort, but I didn't restrict it since it might help someone else and might document exactly where the counter is stored. Hard to tell without the details (and I'm not up on 6.1.3 jailbreak feasibility either) <comment103333> Excellent. Using PhoneView, I was able to reset both my Last Directory to 100 and image to 0001. Thanks so much for the explanation. After attempting to delete the images using Image Capture, some were still left over, so I pruned those as well using the tool. I then had some empty albums in the Photos app, but deleting them seems to have things clean to start afresh.
