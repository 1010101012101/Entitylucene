Launch Gedit while sshing in terminal <body> I know i can do it in linux, anything similar in osx?  <answer13473> Firstly make sure X11 is installed (it's an optional install on the OS X dvd)  You need to ssh in with X11 forwarding.  Open terminal and type codessh -X username@host/code  where username and host are the relevant details.  This will log you in.  Once logged in type codegedit/code and the X11 server on your mac will start and show the gEdit window.  <comment14256> hm got Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: <comment14257> is you're linux ssh server setup to forward X11 packets? <comment14258> see edit, make sure X11 is installed on your mac too <comment14260> its installed and enabled. Just another bit of diagnostic help when i echo display i get a blank line <comment14261> when I echo $DISPLAY, it says localhost:10.0 <comment14273> With Apple's X11 the $DISPLAY value is a socket not localhost <comment14275> Thats what I got when I SSH'ed into the linux box.  On my mac I just get a blank like like @Jacopo.   But gEdit runs and other apps run perfectly <comment14478> hm, i feel like this question might be more applicable on serverfault,as it seems more and more like the issue is on the server side <comment14496> on the server have you configured SSH server to forward X11 packets?
