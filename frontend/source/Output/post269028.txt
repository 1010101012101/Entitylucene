Compress the contents of multiple folders and rename them with the name of the container folder <body> I have this folder structure:  precodeany_folder |-subfolder1 |   |--child1 |   |--child2 |   |--child3 | |-subfolder2 |   |--child4 |   |--child5 |   |--child6 | |-subfolder3 ... /code/pre  I want automator to ask for a folder from me (any_folder) and compress the children of its sub-folders (codechild1/code, codechild2/code and codechild3/code as codesubfolder1.zip/code, codechild4/code, codechild5/code and codechild6/code as codesubfolder2.zip/code...) My requirement is to compress only the contents of the sub-folders, not the sub-folders themselves.  I start with "Ask For Finder Items" and then "Get Folder Contents" but I cannot go further.  I find related answers here, here and here, but I could not apply them to my problem.  Is what I want possible with automator? Without shell scripting?
