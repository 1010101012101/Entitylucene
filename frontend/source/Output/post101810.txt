Is it possible to display my Mac on my iPhone using a USB cable? <body> I've tried AirDisplay and Splashtop but they aren't fast enough, they are always delayed . I need something to see videos and play games without any kind of delay. Because AirDisplay and Splashtop use wifi connection they doesn't work the way I want. Is there any option to mirror my Mac to an iPhone but using a USB cable so it can't be delayed?  Thank you.  <answer101815> They are the only options as of now. They are slow because of your internet.   Even USB have speed limitation.   And using a USB cable 6 or 12 feet long would defeat the purpose (you are to close to the Mac for any benefit).  Your WiFi speed should be good enough to watch streaming Videos without delay showing  200kb/s.  To check, click on the WiFi while holding the alt key, that will open more detailed information on your WiFi.  In there it should say  MCS index 10  <answer101864> I use an app called Presence from Flying Mac. Here's the link. Just watch the slideshow on their homepage, to get an overview of the app's capabilities. The developers are very helpful as well.
