Why aren't calories burned when swimming added to the calorie ring on the watch? <body> The health app is hooked to the speedo app. Why doesn't the health app relay the calories burned to the watch? Whenever I swim the calorie ring on the watch is not accurate.  <comment249578> I was hoping, from things I had heard, that Watch OS 2 would solve this, but so far I have not seen any way to get it working there either.
