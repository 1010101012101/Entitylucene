Running Cron Job w/ Sudo permissions <body> Strictly for learning purposes (possibly maintenance as well) I am trying to have a Cron job empty my trash once a day.  I have opened terminal and entered the command codecrontab -e/code to access the VI editor to add the command. I've entered Insert mode and added code* * * * * sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/*/code, hit the escape key to exit and quit VI with code:wq!/code  This particular script I have running every minute just to see if it works and it is not. I thought it might be an issue with cron not having root access, so I added the same line to the codesudo crontab -e/code file and it doesn't seem to be saving.  Any ideas what could be wrong with this cron job?  <answer267852> You think you need to use sudo.  You don't.  You're not trying to empty root's Trash folder. You have permission to delete files in your own code~/.Trash/code folder, so you don't need to become root (which is what sudo does) to do the coderm/code.  You can simply use:  precode* * * * * rm -rf ~/.Trash/* /code/pre  Note, I'd also advise against using code~/code in a dangerous command like this (any time you're calling coderm -rf/code it's potentially dangerous). Put the full path to the code.Trash/code folder so it's very explicit what will happen when the line is executed. Something like code/Users/yourusername/.Trash//code. So:  precode* * * * * rm -rf /Users/yourusername/.Trash/* /code/pre  Where you replace codeyourusername/code with your actual user name on the host.  <answer267854> If you want to specify the the root user's crontab, you have to use the code-u/code option.  codesudo crontab -e -u root/code  That said, there's a safer way to clean out your trash than just removing the whole directory.  Personally, I like to remove files that are older than a certain number of days.  This way, if I inadvertently delete something today, I have a "buffer" of time in which to recover from.  The following command will delete all files that are strongolder/strong than 15 days.   codefind ~/.Trash/ -type f -mtime +15 -exec rm {} \;/code  Now...that said...  codecron/code has been deprecated for codelaunchd/code.  I would take some time and learn how to create code.plist/code XML files for codelauchd/code and use that service instead of codecron/code    <comment336152> Why are you trying to delete the files from your user's `.Trash` with `sudo` in the first place? Is your sudoers configuration set to NOPASSWD? <comment336153> @techraf Does running anything is Cron automatically grant sudo rights? if not, how can I run sudo rights within a Cron job? <comment336154> I asked you two questions, please answer. <comment336166> Thank you for the well explained answer! That makes sense and it worked! <comment336168> This was super helpful as well! <comment336184> re ~ ut is not a recommendation not to use it. It just does not work in cron
