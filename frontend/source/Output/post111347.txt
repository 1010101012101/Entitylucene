How to open CSV file with Microsoft Excel and get the information into separate columns? <body> I have a problem opening my .csv files in Excel; when importing them, all the information is in one column. How do I get Excel to separate the information automatically into different columns?  I have a MacBook Pro and Iâ€™m using Excel 14.3.8.  <answer111360> It is interesting that if you really have a comma separated text file, you actually have to select the comma separator, the only separator that is selected by default is "Tab".  ol liSelect the CSV file to import./li liSelect "Delimited" in the "Text Wizard Import 1 of 3" dialog./li liMake sure the "Comma" checkbox is checked in the "Text Wizard Import 2 of 3" dialog./li liUnselect "Tab" if you have tabs embedded in your data in the same dialog./li liContinue with the text wizard dialogs and select finish./li /ol  The final screen, when "Finish" is enabled, will show a sample of how your data will be imported so you can see before you finish that it will be properly separated into columns.
