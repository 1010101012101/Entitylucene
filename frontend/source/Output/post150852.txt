Can I replace RAM or processor in new Mac mini? <body> Is it possible from technical point of view to replace/upgrade on my own RAM or processor in new Mac mini released today (assuming that I'll use compatible replacement)?  <answer150855> h2No RAM or processor replacement in the Mac Mini 2014/h2  An iFixit teardown reveals this. And @Pol posted a link to macminicolo.net were you can read about the soldered RAM.  The processor and the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard. Even in a clean room, a soldering iron and a steady hand, it would be nearly impossible. You are not allowed to do this on your own, your warranty will expire on this one.  strikeYou can replace your RAM yourself, Apple has even provided a guide on how to do it on similar hardware (2012 model). Here you can find the guide: "Mac mini: How to remove or install memory". No problems with your warranty./strike  <answer151882> As it turns out, we can't replace RAM too. It's soldered.  <comment177570> that is way to soon to tell, it was announced 2 hours ago, by my guess, ram is easily accessible, however... thats provided apple hasn't gone to solderd ram the cpu, thats a entirely different task <comment177575> I'm not fully convinced on the RAM upgradeability yet - they did say now it's using LPDDR3; isn't that usually the soldered RAM? Also, it sounds like we lost the second SATA port in favor of a PCIe storage port - which is a problem for my own upgrade (since I paid for a 1TB aftermarket SSD and a 2TB data drive...) Guess we'll have to wait for the iFixit teardown! :-) <comment177619> Or we need to see the bottom of the device. But 'usually' apple does change the casing with the change of motherboard. <comment178765> Dust is not a factor when soldering. Also, iFixit has a terrific teardown of the new mini: https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac+Mini+Late+2014+Teardown/30410
