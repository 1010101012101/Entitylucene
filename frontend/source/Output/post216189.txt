iphone icon won't show up in itunes <body> I upgraded iTunes and now my iPhone won't show up in it. I have uninstalled iTunes, reinstored it and still nothing. I go to file, click on devices and sync etc is not highlighted. Can anyone help me?  <answer216227> I have answered here for a different problem, but maybe relevant to you - iPhone 6 won&#39;t connect to Windows 7  <comment261216> Can you see the device in Device Manager (Windows) or in System Report (Mac)? <comment261256> Have you tried a different USB port? A different cable?  I know you think the symptom is upgrading iTunes, and it may be, but eliminate the other possibilities too. <comment261380> I can't see the iPhone in the device manager on my computer. I have an iPhone 5.
