Is it possible to scroll the tabs in Safari if there are too many like Firefox? <body> When I open a lot of tabs in safari it shows the first ones normally and all those, which do not fit a grouped into one tab. This is very annoying when switching between tabs that are at the end.  Is it possible to make them scrollable as it is done in Firefox?  <answer119918> Take a look at the answer to this similar question. It suggests using Glims which, whilst it won't allow you to scroll tabs, it does allow you to set the minimum tab size to the favicon size, which allows you to have many more tabs open at once without the grouping behaviour.  <answer119919> If you are running the latest version of Safari, you can pinch in on a trackpad to reveal all of your tabs. You can swipe through this list using two fingers or by clicking on the dots below the previews.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7kG0w.jpg" alt="Scrollable Tabs in Safari"  <answer132700> Apple announced that this will be a future feature in Safari when Yosemite ships.

During the WWDC Safari demo one of the things shown was how you could scroll "quickly" through a large amount of tabs. I usually prefer native solution than add-ons anyway.  <comment139496> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/108668/is-there-a-shortcut-to-change-tabs-on-safari <comment139510> i don't want it to be done by a shortcut, but thanks for the hint <comment139513> For those of us who are not familiar to this.  Can you provide details of how you achieve this in Firefox. I.e what input device is used, actual behaviour and is it standard to Firefox or an add on. Thanks <comment139517> no add-on or anything is needed, it's the standard behavior in firefox.
