Why is iAd Workbench completely broken? <body> Since the release of iOS 9, I can't view my ad revenue.

It happens on my phone as well.   ul liSafari on a Mac. Yosemite 10.10.5 /li liMobile Safari on my iOS 9-running iPhone 6/li liGoogle Chrome on 64-bit Windows 7/li /ul  What gives?  <answer206855> If you have that many browsers failing, you should contact Apple Developer support to have them check on things.  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/contact//li /ul  The system status show no outage so you'll need someone on the inside to point out what you're doing wrong or fix what they're doing wrong (other than still using Tomcat, I suppose).
