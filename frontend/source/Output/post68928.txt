Is it possible to run VMware Fusion in the background to hide the windows and icons it produces? <body> I have multiple virtual machines setup in VMware Fusion.   Some of them are only servers (like Ubuntu), which I want to run without seeing the VMware Fusion icons or windows, a little like VMware Server does.   Does anyone have a solution?  <answer68940> The best I can figure without hacking into the Dock is to set VMWare fusion to launch at boot and hide itself. The OS is designed to show apps that call for a graphical interface, so it's really up to VMWare to program their app to run as a background daemon if you don't want to work around this OS feature.  You could also explore placing that app under Mission Control and putting it on a secondary virtual display so you don't see it unless you need to observe a guest OS.  <answer68941> It appears you can start Fusion headless by executing the following:     /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmrun -T fusion   start ~/Documents/Virtual\   Machines.localized/[IMAGENAME].vmwarevm/[IMAGENAME].vmx nogui   You could also add code/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/code to your $PATH or create an alias to have easier access to the codevmrun/code command.  You can find more info on the codevmrun/code command in this PDF. While a bit out-dated, it should still contain relevant information on how to start and stop your server.  If you are interested in running headless Linux servers for your development environment etc, I can also highly recommend to use VirtualBox instead. It is free, has extensive command-line support, and while running headless VMs Fusion loses most if its advantages (seamless GUI integration) over VirtualBox anyway. What's more, tools like Vagrant can even facilitate running these environments to a much greater extent. With the addition of a paid add-on ("provider"), Vagrant can control VMWare as well as VirtualBox for you3.  <answer98473> An additional way, you can start up the VMs you want and then force quit VMware Fusion using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdEsc/kbd  The GUI quits but the VMs run in the background. To manage these VMs you can start VMware fusion again as usual and it will show you what's currently running.  <comment80082> If you don't want to see the icon try the procdure reported here http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/68915/hide-a-running-app-from-dock. For the screen you can minimize it probably. Of course it's not exactly what you want. <comment80096> I'm not sure how to do this with Fusion, but the free VirtualBox is capable of doing that using it's command-line tools and more than sufficient for running headless Linux servers. <comment197111> I like this method, since it's quick and dirty, but you have your shortcut incorrect for the force quit. It's `CMD+OPT+Esc`. No shift needed. <comment249335> Since this answer still appears when searching for this question it's worth mentioning there is at least one very good reason to run your VM's headless in Fusion vs. going to VirtualBox: performance. Fusion still outperforms VirtualBox in almost all benchmarks (indeed, Virtualbox can't even run some benchmarking software without crashing the VM).
