What are the key differences between fink and macports? <body> I don't want to start a holywar, but as far as I am concerned, I am on track according to the faq.  I wanted to know the key differences between macports and fink. I am a long time macports user and am looking for some fresh blood (if I may say so). I was looking towards fink. I'd appreciate it if anyone listed out a few differences between these two package management systems.  <answer21853> Not to hijack, but if you're really looking for a cleaner option, try homebrew. I switched a while back and it's been great.  <answer21854> Fink is a binary distribution using tools that originated from Debian (e.g., apt-get, etc.)  Macports is built around the philosophy used by the FreeBSD ports collection. In this you download tarballs directly from the upstream source, apply patches and compile. It's entirely automated.  I haven't used Fink in quite a while (since Panther) because it didn't seem very well done to me.  <comment24072> fink also installs from source usually later versions in its unstable release <comment24073> Define cleaner please <comment24074> You'd have to ask why everyone now prefers [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) rather than old timey package managers like fink or macports to start a religious war now a days. <comment24101> Less dependency bloat
