Alternatives paid or unpaid to using Apple's Server app <body> So I am setting up a Mac Mini Server (mid 2010) to do some light testing.  My primary uses for this server will be file sharing, wiki site testing and GIT hosting.  As part of this, I'm considering purchasing the Apple Server Application. I've used it before and the GUI is pretty user friendly, however the functionality of this app leaves a lot be desired in certain situations.   I'm curious as to what alternative applications are out there that have close to (or the same) features as Server App?  P.S. I'm assuming responses will be based on different use cases as well.   <comment274890> I flagged your questions as (much) too broad. Please specify **your** use case. But don't ask for all available services. <comment274892> What do you plan to use the server for? Knowing this will help us better answer your question.
