Time Machine on Mac <body> Does the codeTime Machine/code program backup system plus data ?  Will is restore the computer exactly to what is was including both system and data (ie. emails, photos, documents) ?  <answer194378> Yes, it will create an exact copy of what is on your hard drive at that time, including every little email or conversation stored.  <answer194379> Time Machine backs up all content, excluding data you've excluded in the Time Machine preferences pane, most system caches/temporary files, and any data listed in the code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code's ExcludeByPath key.  When you restore from a Time Machine backup, all data is as it was when the last backup was performed. A perfect replica, from the user's side.   Certain Microsoft Office products may notice a change if you restore your Time Machine backup to another computer/hard drive, as it uses the hard drive's serial number to validate software authenticity.  <comment231829> I have to enter min 15 charters to answer YES :)
