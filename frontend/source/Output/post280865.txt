"Last Import" in Photos shows 1,000s of photos, not just last import <body> The "Last Import" function of Photos seems stuck.  It shows all my photos from Feb, 2012 - Feb, 2017.  Which is really strange, as I import photos from my phone about once a week.  I.e., I'm imported dozens of times since Feb, 2017.  How do I reset/fix this?  <answer280888> You could try rebuilding your Photos Library. However, strongensure you have a backup/strong of your Photos Library (e.g. a Time Machine backup) strongbefore/strong rebuilding the library!  To rebuild the library, follow these steps:  ul liMake sure that Photos is strongnot/strong running/li liWhile holding down the kbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbd keys, launch the Photos app/li liThe emRepair Library/em window should appear/li liClick on kbdRepair/kbd to rebuild your photo library/li /ul  Depending on the size of your library, this may take some time.  <comment353361> Read the whole thing, because the warnings come after the spell? <comment353367> @DonielF Sorry, I don't understand your comment. Can you clarify? <comment353368> Sorry. Doctor Strange reference. <comment353369> Oh! Okay. But I think I see what you were getting at now - I've edited my answer to put the _warning_ before the steps! Thanks for the feedback. :)
