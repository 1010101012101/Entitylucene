Am I able to retrieve document from backup time machine used to done?  <answer150764> You can drill down into the Time Machine folder hierarchy just like any other disk...  [Time Machine Drive]  Backups.backupd  [Computer name]  Latest - then you're into the old hierarchy as it was on your previous system.  if Latest has been overwritten by the new system then you'd have to dig by date or use search.
