10px~ gap between application and dock <body> When I set my apps to fullscreen with the taskbar still there, it doesn't truly fullscreen the application, it always has that small little border to the left.  I'm using moom as a window resizer, but even without it, I still get the same problem. Is this a setting somewhere? My dock is on the left as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tPHOs.png" alt="enter image description here"  same problem here  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2143319?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer96576> It is actually 4px on non-retina displays.  I have tried using gdb and strings to find preference keys for removing the gap, but I haven't found anything. Most windows can't be resized so that they cover it with AppleScript either.  The only way I know to remove it is to disable Dock completely with for example codelaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Dock.plist/code. But it also disables Mission Control, Launchpad, full screen windows, and the application switcher, and it makes desktop backgrounds gray.  A more practical workaround might be to make the desktop background (or parts of it on the side the Dock is on) solid black.  <comment113456> Wow that is incredibly silly. It is infuriating to no end. I am not going to sleep at night. Thank you for looking into it though.
