OSX 10.7 Apache can't do file uploads to local server <body> I have Apache running on another machine on the local network but am unable to do certain things that I can on the live server - namely perform file uploads.  Wordpress tells me this may be because Apache doesn't have permissions to write to the website directories - does anyone know how to fix this?  The website folder is shared on the network also so I can't really go around codechmod/codeing it incase I break access for someone else.  Any help appreciated  <answer34145> You are having a directory permissions issue. You should ensure that the folder you are uploading to allows read/write/execute access for the web user (typically _www).  In practice, this means you should change the owner and/or group of the folder, or allow read/write/execute for all:  precodechmod 777 /path/to/uploads /code/pre  <comment38948> What is the error? <comment38952> generally it's just an HTTP error depending on the uploader. Wordpress says "error creating directory [dir]. Is it writable by the server?" or words to that effect - I've already googled this ofcourse but found nothing helpful. <comment38953> the error is the same nomatter what uploader or code I use to try and create or save a file on the server - wordpress is merely the most verbose of these when it fails so I used that as an example. <comment38957> good to know the user, thanks. just one niggle - i can't seem to find a terminal on the server. do you happen to know where they hid it? or is it normally in plain view? <comment38960> Do you have direct access to the server or are you logging in remotely? The server is running MacOS X right? <comment38962> yes I have gui access, it's across the room, running osx 10.7 <comment38963> Then it should be at /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app <comment38964> aaahh found it. sorry that's my fault, eyes needing tested lol. thanks for your help, this worked.
