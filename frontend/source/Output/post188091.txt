Find out what key code brightness up/down has <body> I am writing a script and I need to figure out current key codes for brightness up and down.  I know the standard for a MacBook is 107 and 113, though as soon as I connect a different bigger apple keyboard, those changes to 145 and 144.  And also, is there any way to find out if codefn/code is needed for the user in order to change brightness?  I need to be able to get this information out of the terminal.  Is this possible?  <answer188094> The 'System keys' don't seem to have a Key Code equivalent, they are actioned below the OS-level. Try Key Codes (freeware)    <answer188103> Simply save these lines (first one makes your screen darker, second one brighter) in one Applescript .scpt file each:  precodetell application "System Events" to key code 107  tell application "System Events" to key code 113 /code/pre  and execute them with   precode/usr/bin/osascript /path/to/the/script /code/pre  <comment222527> Thank you, I tried this but it seems like the brightness keys are silent. <comment222529> Precisely. All the system keys seem to be :( Did you see thisâ€¦ http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16622/how-to-dim-and-un-dim-display-in-automator <comment222548> Yeah, the problem is that the key code is not the same with an external keyboard for example, read my question again. <comment222550> Oops, sorry, I'll update my answer once I get ahold of my external keyboard.
