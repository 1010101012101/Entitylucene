Different Node versions in OS X El Capitan <body> Is it possible to run different Node versions in OS X El Capitan with Homebrew?  <answer229923> Yes. When node updates a package, it doesn't remove the old version. You can also install old versions of a package using codebrew versions/code, but you will probably need to install the codeboneyard/code tap in order to be able to do this. See here and here.  Based on this answer: Use codels $(brew --cellar)/code to determine what you have installed, and codebrew ls -v/code to see installed packages and versions. You can then call the installed binaries directly (or make your own aliases to them).  <comment280513> Yes, see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7751222/multiple-side-by-side-versions-with-homebrew) on StackOverflow. <comment280551> @uint128_t Should make that an answer, as it seems to be complete enough to answer the question. <comment280557> @JMY1000 Fair enough, done :)
