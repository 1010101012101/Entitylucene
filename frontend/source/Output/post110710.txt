What Windows 7 Product Keys will work for Bootcamp! <body> I am trying to setup Bootcamp, but am having a tough time. I know this question has been asked previously, but all of the answers are outdated. What SKU product key for Windows 7 is licensed for Bootcanp on 2013 MacBook Pro?  Keep in mind I don't have a DVD drive which makes use of any optical media problematic.   <answer111142> At least the following versions of Windows 7 will work find on bootcamp.  ul liHome Premium/li liProfessional/li liUltimate/li /ul  all work. In order to obtain a key for one of these versions, You will need to find an ISO and a Matching Product Key emfor the same version of windows/em.   Microsoft offer downloads of Windows 8 from the Microsoft Store. If you're set on Windows 7, then your options are limited.  ol liIf you have a MSDN account, you can download an MSDN ISO from there./li liYou can purchase Windows 7 from a reseller (Amazon, NewEgg, ) and borrow a USB optical drive to use a retail CD/DVD./li liDownload the Relevant ISO directly here (Content hosted on Digital River), and then use the Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool to install.  ul liHome Premium SP1 (English, 64-bit)/li liProfessional SP1 (English, 64-bit)/li liUltimate SP1 (English, 64-bit)/li liHome Premium SP1 (English, 32-bit)/li liProfessional SP1 (English, 32-bit)/li liUltimate SP1 (English, 32-bit)/li /ul/li /ol  I'd wager that each of these methods would work for Windows 8, except the direct downloads, which link to Windows 7 only.  <comment130805> WHere in the store are downloads of Windows 8 whoich are not upgrades from Vista/Windows 7? <comment130806> Sign in to your Microsoft Store account using your Microsoft account and password. In the right-hand menu, click Downloads, Product Keys, and Subscriptions. On the Downloads, Product Keys and Subscriptions page, find the Windows product that you purchased. Select the download option (32-bit or 64-bit) and file type ISO <comment130809> The question is more which product do I buy and where is that on the store? <comment130811> Just go to the purchase screen, and make sure *download* is selected. http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/mseea/en_IE/pdp/Windows-8/productID.275219500 <comment131240> Isn't the point of StackExchange to be able to improve on old/outdated questions and answers, rather than re-asking ad infinitum? <comment131249> The question specifically stipulates that I do not have access to an optical drive. <comment131250> Please also provide direct links, for instance to the Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool <comment131252> I wanted to provide a comprehensive answer, which other people may find useful, too. Also, you just said it would be 'problematic' and therefore I didn't rule out borrowing of an optical drive. The Windows 7 USB/DVD Download tool link has now been fixed. <comment131309> I find this answer really lacking. You can also get a Product Key from go2keys.com, for much cheaper. All of the sites you mention only sell DVDs, rather than just keys <comment131312> Sincerest apologies for not listing all possible websites which sell Product Keys for Microsoft products. I wanted to list the most genuine and simplest instructions which answer your question. Also, DVD's come with keys.
