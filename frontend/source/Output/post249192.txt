Send mail from multiple accounts that are the same account but belongs to different domains <body> I've a single email server that is the same server for the following domains:  ul limyprivatedomain.com /li limycompany.com/li /ul  Say I've an account on that server, for example "me"  So I've two email addresses for the same account  ul lime@myprivatedomain.com/li lime@mycompany.com/li /ul  Both email addresses are "the same" and at the server side there is no distinction. It is physically the same income folder and this is the desired behavior.  In a typical situation, when I write an email I decide if the email "FROM" will be emme@myprivatedomain.com/em or emme@mycompany.com/em  In order to properly set up Mail.app in my mac I need to create two different email accounts. I cannot simply create one "inactive" and another "active" account as I do in Outlook. Mail app is connecting twice to the email server and displaying twice the same information.  How can I set up Mail.app in order to have only one connection to the server and have the possibility to decide the mail that will appear at the FROM field of the email?
