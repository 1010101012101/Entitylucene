Firefox: double-click on titlebar maximize window instead on open new tab <body> Recently, I noted that Firefox started to behave differently when I double-click on its title-bar / tab-bar.  It maximizes the windows as if I clicked on the semaphore kbd+/kbd button, instead of opening a new tab like it used to do before.  Anyone knows how to get the old behavior back?  <answer223020> Double-click to maximise is a System pref   menu  System Preferences  Dock  Uncheck "Double-click a window's title bar to…zoom"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JHRTr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment270296> Actually I'm still on Yosemite cause of compatibility issues, and there is no option to zoom, only minimize. Anyway it always have been unchecked since I have my Mac. <comment270297> ah, OK - must be new Firefox behaviour itself then. I've not used it myself, so all I could suggest is dig & see if you can find a pref <comment270314> Yes, it seems that, on older OSX, if "Double-click to minimize" is unchecked, it behaves as if El Capitan's "Double-click to maximize" was selected. Anyway, I searched in all preference panes, also in the about:config advanced page, but found nothing.
