Can't install php56-mcrypt with homebrew <body> I use Homebrew on my testing server on OS X.br I have php56, autoconf, and mcrypt installed through homebrew.  I was successful doing this on a different Mac but I am not having any luck this time.  When I type:  precodebrew install php56-mcrypt /code/pre  like I did on the other mac, it says:  precodeAlready downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/php56-mcrypt-5.6.7 ==&gt; /usr/local/opt/php56/bin/phpize 2015-05-13 14:19:26 -0700  /usr/local/opt/php56/bin/phpize /code/pre  Despite it stating that is "already installed", when going into code/usr/local/Cellar//code there is no folder called "php56-mcrypt" like it had on my other Mac.  I have not done anything abnormal that I am aware of. What can I do? Is re-installing the best option?  <answer197834> You probably need to link it. There may have been an error when you installed it that prevented it from being linked at that time. For example, it would not have been able to be linked if another version of mcrypt was linked when the install was running.  precodebrew link php56-mcrypt /code/pre  If another version is already linked, then running this command will tell you which version is linked and how to unlink it.
