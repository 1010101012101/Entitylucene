Upgrading my Mac Pro 1,1 to run on El Capitan <body> strongI have the Mac Pro "Quad Core" 2.66 (Original):/strong  ul liemModel identifier:/em 1,1/li liemRam:/em 32 GB/li liemGraphics Card:/em GeForce 7300 GT/li liemHard Drive:/em 750GB HDD Seagate/li /ul  I have the Mac Pro currently running Mac OS X Lion and would like to update this to Mac OS X Yosemite or Mac OS X El Capitan if possible. I was wondering what kind of upgrades I would need to do to make this possible and the best way to do it for as low cost as possible.  <answer276767> I used to have one of these, unfortunately there is no emsupported/em way to install those OSs on this particular system. Though they are 64bit machines the EFI boot loader is 32bit.  There are hacks out there that let you install later OS versions on a MacPro 1,1. I think MacRumors.com has a long thread of people who have done this and likely other places as well. But I am unsure if this is considered off-topic or not for Ask Different, so that is far as I will go.  <answer276768> What you want to do is not an easy task. I'm not saying it's emimpossible/em, but strongyou do risk bricking your machine/strong. I assume you have some software that requires Yosemite or El Capitan, so only you can decide whether the risk is worth it.   The trick is not as much about the hardware as it is about convincing your old Mac Pro to run in 64-bit mode. That's because your Mac can't natively boot OS X Yosemite or El Capitan without a different boot loader.  I have seen a number of approaches used to get these machines to work with newer OS versions, so it's too hard to try and summarise these here.

Basically, the question is still about installing original Apple software on original Apple hardware and it's specific enough (i.e. the OP has a specific problem that can be answered one way or another), so I see the question as being on-topic.. <comment348475> I understand the skill and patience required to pull this off but what is the ultimate worst case scenario, I loose all my data or I completely brick the computer? <comment348486> Well, if you don't have a backup, then losing all your data would be a worse case scenario in my opinion. But, yes, it is possible you could also brick the computer. Obviously, all anyone here can do is answer the question you've asked. But behind many questions is a context we can't guess - for example, we have no idea _why_ you want to upgrade to either Yosemite or El Capitan and, depending on your reasons, there _may_ be other solutions. If you don't have another Mac, I would avoid trying to upgrade it - but if not, then only you know whether it's worth the risk. <comment348487> The MacRumors forum discussion I linked to is very long, so before proceeding I'd read it all and make note of anything that is of interest or concerns you. You should also get a sense for the success rate of doing this, and for how well the Mac Pro will run the OS. Then you can decide whether the risk is worth it.
