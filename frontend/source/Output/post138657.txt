Mavericks Server /Work group manager issues <body> I upgraded a test server running snow leopard to mavericks and then was having some weirdness so I decided to recreate my open directory, users and groups.   Server appears to be running and I am able to connect from a laptop /user   But... Work group manager does not see the users in Server except the server diradmin user, and there is a message at the top that says  strong"Viewing local directory /Local/Default. Not Authenticated."/strong  Now I'm assuming the problem is that I need to authenticate Work group manager but I don't see how...  Previously I did see my users but they were all grey'd out. I think that's when I decided to recreate my open directory, users and groups. but now I see nothing as I said.  Also I get a message from Work Group Manager strongYou are working in a directory node that is not visible to the network./strong  I should mention,   HOST NAME is nserver.local  WORK GROUP MANAGER Version 10.9 (421) SERVER Version 3.1.2 (1354517)  My users are all Local Network Users, My server does not use a domain name, I intend to have shared user storage, VPN and perhaps calendar.  Any tips or ideas?  Thank!  <answer139008> SOLVED FOR ME.  I don't recall seeing this before in Snow leopard (the interface was slightly different...), on the same line at the message "Viewing local directory /Local/Default. Not Authenticated." there is a small triangle --- clicking on this reveals a drop menu.  Select LDAPv3 from the list.  Then click on the lock at the far end of that bar.  Authenticate as DIRADMIN and it works.
