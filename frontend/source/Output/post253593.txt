shortcut to open multiple programmes and have them open a specific file <body> When writing code for web i need to have several programmes and files open at the same time, i need :   ul liproject folder open in sublime text/li literminal open and on a specific directory /li litower (git client) open on the correct project /li limamp open and running /li librowser open and on to local server url /li /ul  It takes me a few minutes to setup each time, is there a way i can automate these so that with one action all will open and be in the correct configuration ?   Im running osx 10.10  <answer253603> The short answer is yes. The longer answer is, it can be done more then one way.  I'd probably opt for a bash script and wrap it in a application bundle using Platypus, although you can use a Run Shell Script action in Automator too.  In Automator you might want to try the Watch Me Do action, although that will be slower then just a bash script.  Note that some things you mentioned may not be able to be bash scripted, can't say for sure because I do not use Tower or MAMP, although the others are bash scriptable  I can't give a complete answer as I do not use Tower or MAMP however for Sublime Text, Terminal and Safari the following works for me.  Note that Sublime Text includes a command line executable codesubl/code within its application bundle. The typical path might be, code/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl/code and executing it with code--help/code will display its internal help information.  The following script example could be used if you can ascertain the commands necessary for Tower and MAMP.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code#!/bin/bash  /path/to/subl --project &lt;project&gt; open -a Terminal /path/to/the/location/I/want # Tower commands. # MAMP commands. open -a Safari http://127.0.0.1 /code/pre
