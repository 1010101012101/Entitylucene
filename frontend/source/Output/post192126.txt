Enable wifi hotspot on Macbook Pro Mid 2014 <body> I am trying to share the internet connection from my MBP Mid 2014. It seems I can only share the internet through the Thunderbolt Bridge or Bluetooth PAN but I need it through the wifi for my Mobile device.  Is there any way I can share the internet connection through wifi ?  Thanks in advance.  <answer192130> You must select ethernet in the "share your connection from"  after you must select Wi-fi in "To computers using"  <comment228399> What's your outgoing connection? Ethernet/Thunderbolt? …or are you trying to share wifi whilst using wifi… which can't be done - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192105/sharing-wifi-from-mac-to-iphone <comment228406> @Tetsujin I am trying to share wifi whilst using wifi <comment228408> MBP Mid 2014 version don't have a ethernet port. I only have 2 choices Thunderbolt or Bluetooth. <comment228413> then it can't be done - you have to go 'through' the machine, you cannot re-use the same interface for both 'ends' of the connection. <comment228416> Ok. Select the Wi-fi option on the "share your connection form" <comment228417> after select bluetooth in the "To computers using" <comment228418> Let me know id you need another information
