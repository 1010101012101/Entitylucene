Airport Express DNS problem <body> In my living room I have a wireless router, the “main” router. One of its ethernet port is connected to a powerline (strongTL-PA4010KIT/strong). In my bedroom I’ve another powerline connected to an AirPort Express (AP). If my brother uses his laptop (Minecraft &amp; Skype) through wireless near to the main router in the living room my AP acts really strange like if it can’t get an IP or the main router DHCP goes nuts and it cant assign an IP to it. And as a result I can’t extend the network. My AP is Extending Wi-Fi networks over Ethernet (roaming) and it works quite well when my brother isn't side-by-side with the router (btw, shouldn't the problem persist if he is near or far?)  If my brother uses his laptop away of the main router or in his bed room (using my AP extension) everything works well.  What’s happening and how can we prevent this?  Thanks.  strongEDIT/strong, user strongTyson/strong questions:     Is the AP configured with static IP in the same subnet as the main   router but outside the main routers DHCP range?   No, but actually I thought it could be a good solution     Is DHCP turned off on AP?   I would say yes because in Network tab I have Router Mode: Off (Bridge Mode)br But in the Internet tab I have Connect Using: DHCP     What Local IP address does your brother get when close to main router?   The IP range is 192.168.1.1 - 100, currently he's using 192.168.1.2     And what ip does he get when connected to AP?   Guess it's the same 'cause after a renew it didn’t change.  The pictures bellow show both situations: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1tOoC.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pTO9h.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment288908> Get rid of the brother?  ;-) <comment288931> That was the first thing I thought ^^. Fortunately he's not using his laptop near the router, now that I've told him not to, but I would like to understand what was happening and how could I prevent it in a more "technologic" way. <comment288937> Is the AP configured with static IP in the same subnet as the main router but outside the main routers DHCP range?  Is DHCP turned off on AP?  What Local IP address does your brother get when close to main router? And what ip does he get when connected to AP? <comment289131> @Tyson question updated. Thanks. <comment289132> Those are two different subnets, look at the top ip in each screenshot, that likely means both are serving DHCP requests.  Give the AP a static ip outside the main routers DHCP range but in the same subnet (first 3 octets of the IP the same) and turn off the AP's DHCP. <comment289138> My main router doesn't have the ability to attribute a X IP to a Y MAC Address so I had to configure my Airport Express to statically use 192.168.1.77 (the pool ends in 70). Well I guess it made some effect 'cause now the IP and LAN IP are the same and I have a green light. My bro is not at home right now, but I'll do a final test and get back at you with the results. Thanks once again. <comment289315> Be sure to @ me if you reply again, I just happened to find the above.   It's tricky to get setups like these working but it can be done, never plug and play tho. <comment289483> @Tyson, so the DNS problem it's solved, I've a fixed IP and always a green light for the AP. The problem now is the internet (when connected to the AP), it says "Disconnected". Both IP and DNS are the same (when connected to the AP or the main router). <comment289484> Try deleting the network connection on the laptop and re-adding, the value that's likely wrong now is default gateway if you know how to fix just that, but forgetting/removing and re-adding should take care of it.  You had double NAT before so it's trying to find the internet via a route that no longer exists. <comment289702> @Tyson "Open Network Prefs  Advanced  Remove and Add it again" right? Still getting disconnected. In Net Prefs, the status says: Wi-Fi has the self-assigned IP address 169.254.90.91 and will not be able to connect to the Internet. Why am I getting this IP out of the subnet? <comment289714> For some reason it assumed a self generated ip instead of asking the DHCP server to assign one. <comment289715> @Tyson, and why does this strange behaviour happens with the other laptop is connected to the main router? If he's not or if it's connected through the AP, everything works great. <comment289716> Likely because of something being changed while trying to fix the original problem before we started here, is the laptop OS X or Windows or something else <comment289753> I've OS X 10.11.4 my bro Windows 7
