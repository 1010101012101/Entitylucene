Can I change the Shared Family Calendar name <body> The current Mac OS has a concept of family sharing. When you create a family, a calendar "Family" is created in iCloud. It's fine on my computer. Somehow, on my other family member's calendar, the name is a little like "FamilyMurgatroyd" (different name). I think I know how this happened, but I haven't been able to reset it. Local changes in the other member's Calendar app or iCloud page are overwritten with the next refresh.
