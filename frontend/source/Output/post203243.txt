Are my safari and chrome passwords synced? <body> I like to use safari for light browsing (and to prolong battery life).Sometimes I switch to chrome , when I need to(syncing stuff to android,etc).   I would like to know if my passwords(maybe even bookmarks) are getting synced or not.  I am using yosemite 10.10.4 .  If its not being synced out of the box, is there any software that does the syncing ?   <answer203250> When you download a new browser, there should be an option to sync data (I am not sure if it synchronizes once or constantly though). If you did not set it up in fact, they won't sync together.   <answer204276> Best practice is probably to invest in 1Password, which syncs thru Dropbox and has extensions for Safari, Chrome and Firefox. And apps for iDevices. Otherwise, yes, you can import various settings when you open a browser, but what a pain.   <comment245155> Not on mac now. So someone please edit to change the lines in parantheses to some sure facts <comment330470> 1Password doesn't sync bookmarks though... for that you'll also need something like [Xmarks](http://xmarks.com). <comment330472> The function you are talking about is indeed a one-time import. It does not sync anything after that.
