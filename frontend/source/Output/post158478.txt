Consequences of disabling kext signing <body> What are the consequences of disabling Kest Signing on OS X Yosemite? I have disabled it to keep TRIM enabled on my aftermarket SSD. What are the security issues I could run up against? If I install applications only from trusted resources can I run in any kind of trouble?  I couldn't find online extensive answers to these questions. Sorry if it's a duplicate.  <answer158506> It is OK. It is mainly used to detect tampering/modification of device drivers at the kernel level. You should see Trim's note here http://www.cindori.org/trim-enabler-and-yosemite/     In OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), Apple has introduced a new security   requirement called kext signing. (A kext is a kernel extension, or a   driver, in Mac OS X)      Kext signing basically works by checking if all the drivers in the   system are unaltered by a third party, or approved by Apple. If they   have been modified, Yosemite will no longer load the driver. This is a   means of enforcing security, but also a way for Apple to control what   hardware that third party developers can release OS X support for.   <answer223896> TRIM Support has been enabled for Third Party SSDs in OS X El Capitan.
