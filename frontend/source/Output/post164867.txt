Connect to second Wifi network using dongle <body> I have a Macbook Pro running Yosemite (10.10.1) and an Asus wifi dongle.  I would like to connect to two wifi networks. One is a normal home/office/hotel/conference network with a connection to the outside internet, the other is a local internet with two other machines on it (a windows tablet and a PLC controller).  How do I do this?   (I can't even tell if the wifi dongle is being recognized, but it's emsupposed/em to support Mac. When I use it with the windows tablet, I get a "Wifi" and a "Wifi 2" option, and I just set each to different networks)  <answer164871> If you have the USB-AC51 I am afraid it does not work with Yosemite.  In the specs it only shows support up to 10.8 and not for 10.10  source: http://www.asus.com/us/Networking/USBAC51/specifications/  It turns out that someone is claiming that the "Bearextender driver software" works for that, but I can not confirm since I do not have your hardware to test.  http://store.bearextender.com/pages/regarding-yosemite-compatiblity  <comment193337> did you try using the syst pref- Networks? does it show there? <comment193340> WiFi / Bluetooth PAN / Thunderbolt Bridge without the dongle... I plug in the dongle, nothing new shows up.
