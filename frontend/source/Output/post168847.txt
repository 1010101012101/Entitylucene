Find all hidden ".idea" folders in system <body> I am using PHPStorm 8 for programming. PHPStorm automatically creates a hidden folder called ".idea", where all project-specifiy settings are stored.  How am I able to find all these ".idea" folders in the entire system?  (I like to find and remove all of these folder)  Thanks!  <answer168848> You can do it from strongTerminal.app/strong. Navigate to the topmost directory with:  precodecd / /code/pre  Then type this command:  precodefind . -name ".idea" -exec rm -r {} \; /code/pre  This will remove all code.idea/code directories which are owned by You (more specificaly You have the rights to delete them). If You want to delete all of them, add codesudo/code in front of this command.  NOTE: calling codesudo/code without knowing what You are doing can be dangerous.
