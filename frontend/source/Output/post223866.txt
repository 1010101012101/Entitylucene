Typing Pinyin with tone marks doesn't work <body> I have a Macbook Air.  Running El Capitan with British keyboard layout.  I have enabled Chines Simplified Pinyin input.  I am trying to type the tone marks.  For example, pressing kbdopt/kbd+kbda/kbd followed by kbdu/kbd is supposed to produce Å«.  This doesn't work however.  Any advice?  I have seen mentions of US Extended Keyboard or ABC extended keyboard layout as being the culprit.  While this makes 0 sense to me, I have replaced the British layout with this ABC Extended one.  While now I can type the accented characters in it, they still don't work in Pinyin.  This is extremely annoying.  <answer225522> If your purpose is to type Latin script pinyin, then ABC Extended is the right keyboard.  Chinese Pinyin input is only for Chinese script.
