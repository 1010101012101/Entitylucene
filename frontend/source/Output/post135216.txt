Applescript mail errorhandler <body> I have a script to send an email, but I'd like to detect if no email account is setup, and to do something else.   Is there a way to detect or trap for this condition?  Thanks.  precodetell application "Mail"     set new_message to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:false, subject:"AppleScript-2014", content:("Success " &amp; linefeed &amp; "user: " &amp; userName &amp; linefeed &amp; "OS: " &amp; (system version of (get system info)) as rich text) &amp; linefeed &amp; "IP: " &amp; IPv4 address of (get system info)}      tell new_message         make new to recipient with properties {name:"Len", address:"me@law.edu"}     end tell     delay 7     send new_message end tell /code/pre  <answer135295> This ought to do it...  precodetell application "Mail"     set nAccounts to every account     log "Number of accounts: " &amp; (get count of nAccounts) end tell /code/pre
