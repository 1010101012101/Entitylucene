switch back to clang after installing gcc through Macports on Mavericks <body> After I installed Macports (and after that I have installed several versions of gcc through Macports), whenever I type gcc, one of those gcc installed through Macports will be invoked.   Before I installed Macports, whenever I type gcc, clang that comes with XCode will be invoked. (not sure this is true)  Now I need to compile a 3rd-party package with clang, but I don't know how I should do.  strongMy question/strong is: now that Macports (w gcc48) has been installed, what should I do to switch back to the setting where gcc is linked to clang that comes with XCode?  <answer129610> You have to remove it from your code$PATH/code.   One off your possibilites is to just uninstall it : codesudo port uninstall gcc/code  <answer129611> In Terminal:  precodenano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  find the line that looks like this:  precodeexport PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH /code/pre  comment it out by putting code#/code in front of it.  <answer213290> If you want to avoid uninstalling or changing your PATH. Just run:  precodesudo port select --set gcc none /code/pre  â€¦and to re-enable it you run:  precodesudo port select --set gcc gcc5 /code/pre  <comment151766> That will exclude every bin install by Macport ... Definitely not the best idea.
