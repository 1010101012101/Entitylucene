Iphone 5 change default facebook account <body> Before my husband had his own facebook account he would use mine on his phone. Somehow my account became the default account it went to when he presses the facebook icon on his phone. He now has his own facebook account but when we go to delete my account in settings we press facebook and the only account that shows is his. How do I delete my account from his phone? And make facebook only bring his account up.  <comment371059> Have you tried deleting and re-downloading Facebook?
