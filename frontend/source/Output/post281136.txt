Checkpoint VPN Mac OS X from terminal with two factor SMS authentication <body> I have to connect to a network through VPN and there is a web/java based Checkpoint solution for that. It works fine but I want to use the terminal client to make shell aliases for the connections as I could do with Cisco Anyconnect.   The codesnx/code client after I provided the endpoint and username in code.snxrc/code or as arguments initiates the connection and prompts for the password but my problem comes here:  The authentication is two-factored and I get a code in SMS which I have to provide somehow but the codesnx/code gives me back the prompt with failed authentication and nowhere to add the code. I couldn't find any solution for this problem. Also the codereauth yes/code is in my code.snxrc/code.  The snx help isn't very helpful in this case:  precodembp:~ wax$ snx --help Check Point's Mac SNX build 800007107 usage: snx -s &lt;server&gt; {-u &lt;user&gt;|-c &lt;certfile&gt;} [-l &lt;ca dir&gt;] [-p &lt;port&gt;] [-r] [-g] [-e &lt;cipher&gt;]                                 run SNX using given arguments        snx -f &lt;cf&gt;              run the snx using configuration file        snx                      run the snx using the ~/.snxrc         snx -d                   disconnect a running SNX daemon          -s &lt;server&gt;           connect to server &lt;server&gt;         -u &lt;user&gt;             use the username &lt;user&gt;         -c &lt;certfile&gt;         use the certificate file &lt;certfile&gt;         -l &lt;ca dir&gt;           get trusted ca's from &lt;ca dir&gt;         -p &lt;port&gt;             connect using port &lt;port&gt;         -g                    enable debugging         -e &lt;cipher&gt;           SSL cipher to use: RC4 or 3DES /code/pre  When I use the java based version this is what I can see in the java console:     18/04/2017 10:15:16[SNXNetMode] Could not connect to SNX Network Mode,   probably not installed.      18/04/2017 10:15:16[Launcher] Launching /usr/bin/snx -Z   What could code-Z/code stand for?  Has anybody tried any two-factor authentication with codesnx/code terminal client?
