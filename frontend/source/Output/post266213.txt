Remove autocomplete to base URL - want full path! <body> Safari always tries to autocomplete websites to only be the host, with no path (nothing after the ".com/" part).  That is, when I type "ever"... the first option is "evernote.com", when the only site I ever actually visit is "evernote.com/Home.action".  I want it to go directly to that one.  I don't want to have to press "down" once.  Chrome does this the way I want, but I'm trying to move from chrome to safari (chrome eats battery).  This is a brand new MacBook Pro, and I have no bookmarks, deleted all history, iCloud is disabled (I haven't even signed in with an appleID yet), etc.  I can get the "evernote" recommendation to disappear when I delete everything, but as soon as I visit ONLY "evernote.com/Home.action", the base url will start appearing above the action I actually want.  Similar problems ~9 years ago here, can't seem to find a solution. I've been looking for hours now: http://ask.metafilter.com/76691/How-to-turn-off-Safaris-improved-autocomplete  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iozRH.png" alt="This is what happens, :("  <answer266738> Perhaps showing full website address can solve your issue:  precodeSafari-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Smart Search Field: Show full website address [check] /code/pre  <comment336292> thanks for the answer, but doesnt solve what i was going for (that option just seems to hide the path to improve readability - not actually change autocomeplete behavior).  Not sure if what i want is even possible in safari at this point :P
