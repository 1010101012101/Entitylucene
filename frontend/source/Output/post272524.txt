Unable to authenticate Google Apps e-mail account in latest 10.12.4 Beta <body> I am running build 16E154a (the most recent build of 10.12.4 Beta as of 2-10-17)  In both this most recent build, my Google Apps e-mail address (not gmail.com but linked to my registered domain name) is unable to authenticate in the Mac Mail client. It asks for my login and password through a pop-up window and then that window hangs, never fully processing the authentication. I have only encountered this issue with my Google Apps e-mail address; my gmail.com address authenticates normally.  Reading a post on Ask Different makes me thing that this is a known issue which was apparently resolved for some users with the most recent beta update, but it does not seem to have worked in my particular situation.  I took the following steps to attempt to resolve this: 1) Updated to latest beta 2) Checked and never had two-step verification enabled 3) Attempted to remove and reauthenticate my account via the Internet Accounts system preference panel - I was able to remove it but attempting to re authenticate just hangs on the same screen as the Mail app 4) Reset password in account  Any other steps I might take? My suspicion is this is not anything I can fix at this moment.
