How does Siri come up with contact suggestions? <body> Are they recent from days, months?  How long ago?  Are they calls, text, FaceTime?  <answer244144> h1Relevant people/h1  As Apple specified on its website page dedicated to iOS 9, with your Siri suggestions you can     See the contacts you strongtalk/strong with strongmost/strong, those you strongtalked/strong to stronglast/strong, or even   those youâ€™re next strongscheduled/strong to strongmeet/strong   I'd definitely suggest you to have a look to all that Siri suggestions include from here, in fact it doesn't just suggest you Contacts, but also  ul liPlaces/li liApps/li liNews/li /ul  Hope this helped you!
