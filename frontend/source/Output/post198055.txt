How to insert new line on return key press in iMessage on Mac OSX <body> Does anyone know if it is possible in iMessage on Mac OSX to set the return key to go to the next line instead of sending the message?  <answer198056> Press kbdoption/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd or kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd to enter a new line.  Edit: Added additional key combo re: smoooosher's comment to the OP  <answer198064> There is no preference available to control that, but I wonder if you could override the event associated with the Enter key? The following command maps the Enter key to a menu item command. You'd just need to replace the command with "insert new line"... somehow.  precodedefaults write com.apple.iChat NSUserKeyEquivalents "{ 'New Message' = '\\U000a'; }" /code/pre  To undo your change later:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.iChat NSUserKeyEquivalents /code/pre  References:   ol lihttp://osxnotes.net/keybindings.html/li li/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict/li /ol  <answer231291> For me the solution in iMessage: kbdalt/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd  <answer233411> Just tried CTRL+Enter and it worked  <answer242585> Holding down "Shift" + "Option" (Left side - not right, it doesn't work on that side for me) will create spacing between paragraphs without sending the msg  Hope this helps  <comment236901> Have you tried Shift+Enter? Are you looking for the key combo to do it, or to replace the return key functionality altogether <comment236902> That didn't work <comment236910> My apologies, I was thinking on the fly. Either Option+Return OR Control+Return will do the trick. <comment289207> This question didn't yet received a correct answer but a workaround. I found a partial answer which looks like a better ergonomic design: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/236255/22003 . <comment289208> I found one more funny workaround: [ctrl]+[Q], [return]. •••• This is a good way to remind the function of [ctrl]+[Q]. <comment290061> `New Message` isn't the function activated by the `[return]`. •••• The code sent to the application by the `[return]` is `\U000d` and not `\U000a` •••• I didn't find any finished answer along these hints. <comment325785> @danielAzuelos What does control-Q do? <comment325821> This is the same as the solution that was posted a year ago July. <comment325822> This is the same as the solution that was posted a year ago July. <comment347677> @larsmoa, The comment made by daniel Azuelos does indeed work and it's ⌘Q not ^Q that quits an application! <comment347767> Sorry, my bad. I will delete previous comment
