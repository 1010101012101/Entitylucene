Does Parrallel win 10 work well for Macbook 12" 2016? <body> Does Parrallel win 10 work well for Macbook 12" 2016 ? I am going to buy new MacBook 12" as it is so cool. However, I need to use Microsoft Office 365 for my work with full compability.   <answer237658> Yes. Parallels will work with any reasonably new Mac with relatively little performance hit. It uses virtualization technology, and should suit your needs.  With that said, MS Office 365 is compatible with OS X, so I'm not sure why you'd need to use a VM at all.  <comment291166> Mac Office 2016 still misses out on a lot of functionality present in Windows Office 2016 - especially in the level of VBA and Macro support, for example. <comment291167> @Dai Fair enough.
