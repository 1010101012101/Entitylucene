How to import tasks from OmniFocus into 2Do? <body> Is there a way to import tasks from OmniFocus into 2Do?  <answer225381> 2Do currently has no import menu command, but you can use its URL schemes to create new tasks very flexibly. See 2Do URL Schemes. You can use the ofexport package to get your tasks out of OmniFocus, and then use some Applscript magic to generate the URL schemes and send them to 2Do. I haven't done this yet myself but am considering it were I to move to 2Do. An example AppleScript that might help can be found here.
