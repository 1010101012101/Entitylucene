Designed by Jonathan Hoefler in 1991, a version of Hoefler   Text has been included with every version of Mac OS since System 7.5.   <comment36275> Some people built special services for just this type of thing: http://www.whatfontis.com/ <comment36281> @cksum Cool site! Too bad it requires two letters though. <comment36283> @cksum already tried whatthefont, they couldn't id it, neither could yours. :( <comment36293> @martnu According character table on my mac, best choices are: Cambria Math, STIXGeneral, STIXGeneral. But they are not same. It's not full answer, but may be it's point where to look for <comment36303> It's not unlikely this icon did not use any particular font, but was designed as a vector shape. <comment36312> +1 for WTF, but, honestly, BearButte's *i* doesn't look like the *i* on OP's question. <comment36314> I see. May be it is not exact font. This glyph can be created by designer, not extracted from font. I haven't seen same i before (I've seen same i without left flourish in Windows system) <comment36334> @martnu have you asked your question in font-specific forums? <comment37073> Similar on SU: http://superuser.com/questions/345037/is-there-a-program-that-can-scan-an-image-and-tell-you-what-font-type-its-using <comment62338> Where is that icon file stored? I'd like to pixel peep at retina resolutions if possible. My guess it that it's designed by hand and not just a font. See [this](http://www.firewheeldesign.com/sparkplug/2006/April/icon_design_bitmap_vs_vector.php) and [that](http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/6840184364/hand-pixelated) for what I mean hand drawn. <comment62342> I was going to say Garmond Premier Bold Italic Subhead, but yours is closer. <comment79497> And these fonts are available from where? <comment79660> Please visit this site. http://www.fontspace.com/category/italic?p=2 <comment81200> Hello, and welcome to Ask Different! This site is meant to be a collaborative reference for the Apple community, which means answers should be aiming to be detailed, reasoned and useful. in your case, as patrix stated, usefulness suffers from a lack of links. Reasoning and and detail could both be improved by explaining how you conclude these fonts match.
