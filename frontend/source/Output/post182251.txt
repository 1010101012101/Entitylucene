Applescript for multiple find/replace using separate masterlist <body> I am trying to create a script to extract a list of data from column A on document 1, and then use columns A &amp; B on document 2 as multiple find/replace data.  Everything works in so far as grabbing the data required but I don't understand how to write the script to do the find/replace. I want it to run through the entire list from document 1 whilst referencing the first row of the find/replace list (document 2), and then to do the same with row 2, and so on until it reaches the end of document 2.  You will see how I have tried to execute this at the bottom but I don't understand how this should be written. I'd really appreciate some pointers here if anyone would care to help me.  precode-- set paths  tell application "Finder"  set folderpath to folder "Macintosh HD:Users:Will:Desktop:Data1" set filePath to first file of folderpath as alias set folderpath2 to folder "Macintosh HD:Users:Will:Desktop:Data2" set filePath2 to first file of folderpath2 as alias  end tell   -- grab data   set fileRefr to (open for access filePath) set theText to (read fileRefr) set textList to paragraphs of theText close access fileRefr  set uniqueList to {} set dataList to every paragraph of (do shell script "cat " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of filePath &amp; " | awk -F'" &amp; tab &amp; "' 'BEGIN{getline}{print $1}'") set uniqueList to uniqueList &amp; dataList   set fileRefr2 to (open for access filePath2) set theText2 to (read fileRefr2) set textList2 to paragraphs of theText2 close access fileRefr2 set theCNT to (count of textList2) - 1  set uniqueList2 to {} set dataList2 to every paragraph of (do shell script "cat " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of filePath2 &amp; " | awk -F'" &amp; tab &amp; "' 'BEGIN{getline}{print $1}'") set uniqueList2 to uniqueList2 &amp; dataList2  set uniqueList3 to {} set dataList3 to every paragraph of (do shell script "cat " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of filePath2 &amp; " | awk -F'" &amp; tab &amp; "' 'BEGIN{getline}{print $2}'") set uniqueList3 to uniqueList3 &amp; dataList3   -- find/replace data   repeat with i from 1 to count theCNT set uniqueList to (replace_chars of uniqueList from (item i of uniqueList2) to (item i of uniqueList3)) end repeat /code/pre  <answer182274> You must use the text from the first document instead of putting it into a list.  Put the searching text and replacing text from the second document into a list.  Like this script :  precodetell application "Finder"     set filePath to (first file of folder "Data1" of desktop) as alias     set filePath2 to (first file of folder "Data2" of desktop) as alias end tell -- get unique text from the first column set uniqueText to do shell script "awk -F'" &amp; tab &amp; "' 'BEGIN{getline}{print $1}' " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of filePath  -- get unique text from the first column, but print the first and the second column to get the searching text and the replacing text (pair), this put the awk's result into a list set uniqueList2 to paragraphs of (do shell script " awk -F'" &amp; tab &amp; "' 'BEGIN{getline}{print $1\"\\t\"$2}' " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of filePath2)  set uniqueList to my replace_chars(uniqueText, uniqueList2) -- find/replace data, put the paragraphs into a list  to replace_chars(t, L2)     set tid to text item delimiters     set tc to count L2     repeat with i from 1 to tc         set text item delimiters to tab         set {toFind, toReplace} to text items of (item i of L2) -- get items separated by tab from a item in uniqueList2)         set text item delimiters to toFind         set {L, text item delimiters} to {text items of t, toReplace}         set t to L as text     end repeat     set text item delimiters to tid     return paragraphs of t end replace_chars /code/pre  <comment216893> That is fantastic! Thank you so much for helping me out with this. It works perfectly and has also increased my understanding of applescript considerably.
