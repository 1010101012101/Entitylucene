How to mask images in Keynote into circles? <body> I have a bunch of photos that I need on a single slide, and I'd like them all to be shown as circles.  Can I do that out-of-the-box with Keynote?  <answer208652> strongYes./strong  This works for any shape. Here's how:  ol liDraw a shape./li liResize it to the desired size./li liPosition the shape over the image./li liSelect both by shift-clicking them./li liChoose strongFormat/strong → strongImage/strong → strongMask with Shape/strong from the menu (these menu items are from Keynote 6.5.2, might be different for your version)/li liMask the image as you'd usually do (by dragging, resizing)./li liClick strongDone/strong./li /ol  <answer210715> Actually, it is unnecessary to create a shape in order to mask the image.  ul liPlace an image on the slide/li liSelect the image/li liIn the Menu Bar, go to strongFormat  Image  Mask with shape  [select shape]/strong/li /ul  Now drag the mask as desired.  Set this image as a strongMedia Placeholder/strong by selecting the image then, strongFormat  Advanced  Define as Media Placeholder/strong  Copy the image as many times as desired on the slide and then drag new images to them. The mask will be applied to the new image as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pnDNr.jpg" alt="Masking Image menu"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zve8a.png" alt="Apply Mask"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAsk0.png" alt="Masked image result"  <comment251639> In older versions, e.g. Keynote 09 v 5.3 (1170), it's... **Format**  **Mask with Shape**  **Oval**, which starts as a circle and can be sized to include both circles and ovals. <comment328102> works perfectly thanks!
