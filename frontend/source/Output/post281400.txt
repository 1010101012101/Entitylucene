Open Directory keeps entering a sleep state <body> I have a server running Server 5.2 to provide LDAP services to a couple of things.  One of these is a webapp which occasionally reports the following when I attempt to log in:     Error (400 status code): The client HTTP request was badly formatted.      XythosServletContextImpl:89 - DirectoryServiceUtil:1409 - The   LdapServerManager is in sleep state; cannot connect to a directory   server   I have set power settings so that nothing should go to sleep.  This error has only started occurring since I updated the OS to El Capitain from 10.8 (and an older version of Server).  I am guessing there is a command I can use to disable sleep for the OD, but no search reveals this.  Has anyone experienced this and possibly knows the solution?  Is it possible that the change in version needs an update to the OD interface in the webapp?  Thanks for any help.
