Can't quit iTunes normally <body> I am using 10.12.5 and iTunes 12.6.1.27. Whenever I quit iTunes it will hesitate, the main window disappears but the menu bar remains, but the process keeps running and the icon in the dock shows it's still there. And a click on the icon and the window reappears. In Activity Monitor iTunes won't disappear, but it doesn't show any %CPU, then it almost immediately reappears. It will force quit.  I don't have any plugins for it. Same result even if iPhone, iPad aren't connected. I've deleted prefs and reinstalled iTunes. It WILL quit if I restart in Safe Mode.  I looked at Console,and I get stuff like this:  precode    NSApplicationBundleIdentifier = "com.apple.iTunes";         NSApplicationName = iTunes;         NSApplicationPath = "/Applications/iTunes.app";         NSWorkspaceApplicationKey = "&lt;NSRunningApplication: 0x7fc1e713b030 (com.apple.iTunes - 12343)&gt;"; Jul  8 10:37:54 riMac iTunes[12576]: Entered:_AMMuxedVersion2DeviceConnected, mux-device:3 Jul  8 10:37:54 riMac iTunes[12576]: Entered:_AMMuxedVersion2DeviceConnected, mux-device:2 Jul  8 10:37:54 riMac iTunes[12576]: Entered:_AMMuxedVersion2DeviceConnected, mux-device:1 Jul  8 10:37:54 riMac iTunes[12576]: tid:1103 - unable to query device capabilities Jul  8 10:37:54 riMac iTunes[12576]: tid:1a203 - unable to query device capabilities Jul  8 10:37:54 riMac iTunes[12576]: tid:1303 - unable to query device capabilities  Jul  8 10:38:21 riMac iTunes[12576]: _send_message (thread 0x700005e4f000): Could not securely send message size 443: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL errno (Broken pipe).

For those who have the same problem, it was Cindori's Command Center utility. Repeatable on my machines: iTunes won't quit with CC running; will quit if CC isn't running. CC has a function to control iTunes; should have remembered that.
