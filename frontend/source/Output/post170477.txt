How to remove highlighting from emails in Mail? <body> I created a rule that applies a mint green color to a lot of emails in my mailbox. I no longer want that color on those emails and I do not see a way to remove this highlighting for even a single email. I know I could create a new rule to give them a different color, but there is no rule semantics for removing color either.  It seems that all of my email's subjects in Mac Mailbox are now permanently stained.  <answer170481> Looks like you can do it by adding a new Rule [I haven't tested it, because I don't want to actually reset my own colours…]  Try setting Any condition  Every Message  Set Colour…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NT7J4.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note: the 'Other colour seems to depend on your current Colour choice in the Colours floater - Format  Show Colours…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y0V8p.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can do it manually, select one message, pick a colour - but it seems very hit &amp; miss, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.  <answer248071> You can add a colors button to your toolbar. Right-click the top toolbar, click customize, then drag the colors button to your toolbar. Then you can select the messages and change the color.  <answer284353> was facing the problem, but i cant the right way. so i just create a new rule and change all back to white by choosing other color  <answer284355> My experience has been that rebuilding your mailbox will get rid of all coloring. However, this process will cause strongMail/strong to re-download all emails in that mailbox, which depending on the size of the mailbox may take a very long time and use up a lot of bandwidth.  If you’re on a metered connection, that could be a problem.  <comment257570> Right click remove styles I HAVE TO POST 30 CHAR IGNORE THIS LINE! <comment287653> @mandoza3 I don't see any "Remove styles" item in the contextual menu...
