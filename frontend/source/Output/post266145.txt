Is my iPhone hacked based on SysSecInfo anomalies? <body> I installed an app SysSecInfo and it shows 'anomalies' and 'custom jailbreak'. It doesn't explain what is anomalis about it or what it means. How do I know if my iPhone is hacked or if the app is broken?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pfmym.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KltkB.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FISzY.png" width="200"  iPhone 5, iOS 10.2  <answer266146> The app hasn't been updated for iOS 10.2. It expects a previous system, so changes that have occurred as part of Apple's iOS updates are detected as anomalies. Everything looks normal in your screenshots. Furthermore, the AccessibilityBundles was always a known bug as that was shown even when they emwere/em expected.
