Remove iCloud Photos from Mac only? <body> I want to remove the photo library from my mac as it is taking up 25.4GB of space but I want to keep all of the photos on the iCloud so they are accessible from my other devices.  I saw in the settings that there is a Disable and Delete button but I am under the assumption that it will remove all the images from my iCloud too?  <answer251705> You can turn off iCloud Photo Library on your Mac by following the steps in this Apple support doc: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204570.  I always backup my photos first, just in case I make a mistake.  If this is an option for you then I recommend doing the backup before you make any changes.  ul liOn your Mac, go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; iCloud &gt; Options/code next to emPhotos/em/li liDeselect codeiCloud Photo Library/code/li /ul  This will stop photos from syncing to your Mac.  As you've seen, strongdo not/strong select emDisable and Delete/em from this same menu as it will delete your photos from every device.  <comment312931> Once I've done that am I safe to delete the existing photos from my Mac?
