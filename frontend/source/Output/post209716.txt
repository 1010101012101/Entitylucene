Can I connect Amazon fire TV/fire TV stick to my Macbook Pro instead of TV? <body> If I just replace a TV with Macbook Pro, does it work? I haven't tested it yet. Please give me some suggestions. Thanks.  <answer209875> Amazon Fire TV requires a TV with an HDMI eminput/em channel to display video, something MacBooks (or pretty much any computer) are lacking. So no, this will not work (it won't work with an Apple TV/MacBook combination either).  <answer243961> Yes, as long as you have an HDMI port in your Mac. If you don't, you can buy a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter.  <comment300524> The HDMI port on every Mac that has one is *HDMI output* not HDMI input.  See the answer from patrix above. <comment367348> You might manage to make it work with an iMac that has Target Display Mode and a suitable HDMI to DisplayPort or Thunderbolt adaptor. But not with any Apple laptop.
