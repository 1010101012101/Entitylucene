Is there a way to install the .ipsw for the iPad 3 WiFi on my iPad 3 3G? <body> I have an iPad 3 3G.  Now when I turn the power on, it requests that I open iTunes. When I try to install an .ipsw file, I receive error -1, which is related to the baseband chip.  When I open the iPad, I see that the flat cable from the SIM slot is not connected to the baseband motherboard because there is no slot for the flat cable (I don’t know where it is).  I haven’t found any way to fix this. So I tried to install the .ipsw for iPad 3 without 3G (only WiFi), but iTunes says that the firmware is not for this device.  Is there any way to do this?
