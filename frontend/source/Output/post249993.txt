Unable to install OS X, cmd+R opening internet recovery instead of usual recovery <body> I'm trying to clean install OS X El Capitan on a MacBook Pro (early 2015).  After erasing my disk I started the installation of OS X. After accepting the license agreement I was asked to choose a target drive. I hesitated a little bit and wanted to cross-check if I have created the partitions correctly so I canceled the installation. There were no options to go back to Disk Utility so I restarted my machine.  Now when I press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd, it always leads me to internet recovery. The only thing I saw was a spinning globe and I was asked to choose a Wi-Fi connection. I connected to my Wi-Fi network and still only saw a spinning globe. After waiting for a long time it has shown the error strongapple.com/support 2002f/strong   How can I access the normal recovery mode and install OS X?  <answer249994> Your model Mac was shipped with Yosemite (OS X 10.10) installed. The tags you placed on the question suggest you have upgraded to El Capitan (OS X 10.11). There is the possibility you could have erased the Recovery partition by using the Disk Utility if you had Yosemite installed. Evidently, this would be much harder (or perhaps impossible) to do if El Capitan was installed. Also, I do not know if you were using Core Storage and if so, how this would effect the ability to erase the Recovery partition.  Evidentially, you can now only boot using OS X Internet Recovery. You can use Internet Recovery to install the version of OS X that came with your machine. From this, you can go to the App Store and download and install newer versions of OS X.  An alternative would be to use another Mac to download OS X. You can then transfer the download to a USB drive. You then use the USB drive to install OS X on your Mac. The instructions are given the Apple web site: Create a bootable installer for OS X.  <answer250009> Disconnect from the network if you care and then hold the option key when you reboot.  If you have a viable standard recovery HD it will be shown. From there you can attempt to repartition or download an installer.   Another option is to use another bootable OS to run the repair / install. Holding option will let you select those OS once they are connected.  Once you're booted - the steps are the same as recovering from Internet Recovery: Erased Macintosh HD and installing OS X Lion again  <answer250150> I have a workaround for this problem. It seems somehow my system hates my Wi-Fi connection (may be due to some encryptions related to Wi-Fi). When I went to my friend's place and connected to Wi-Fi, I was able to proceed with Internet Recovery. After waiting 5 minutes, I landed on a page similar to normal recovery mode and then I was able to install OS X normally (Yosemite was installed in this case).  If this doesn't work, I would have create a bootable installer for OS X as suggested by David's and bmike's answer  <comment310228> `2002f` usually indicates a network connectivity issue (most likely your MBP can't connect to the WiFi), so it could just be a mistyped password. Doesn't get you out of internet recovery but may allow you to proceed nevertheless. <comment310229> @patrix, I tried change to other wifi connection too. Im sure there is no problem in psw. Also there is a wifi icon that gives me impressions that it is connected successfully <comment310234> That's probably not true: at least in a VM you won't be able to "shoot the horse under your butt" (I don't know if this figure of speech exists in english - a similar one does in german). You can't erase the Recovery HD (or the complete disk containing it) with Disk Utility! <comment310240> @klanomath: I revised my answer. Even though I can test the deletion of the recovery partition using a sparse disk image, I do not know if erasing the OS X partition while booted from the recovery partition would yield the same results. (I just not currently setup in a way that I can test this) <comment310243> You can erase (format) the main system **volume** but you will get the following error trying to erase (partition) the whole disk (containing the main OS X volume & the Recovery HD the Mac is booted to): "Trying to unmount the disk... Impossible to unmount the disk... Action failed!" <comment310246> The `Disk Utility` in any of the 2 recovery modes permit to completely erase the internal disk, including the hidden recovery partition. I did this on purpose on seriously damaged disk and I hopefully I had this level of repair accessible. <comment310256> @danielAzuelos (non-Internet) Recovery HD's El Cap Disk Utility erases itself? I doubt that on a properly working disk! <comment310258> I admit the behavior I have been referring to occurs when using a Yosemite recovery partition. After testing using an El Capitan recovery partition, I see different results. Here the recovery partition is unaffected  by changes to the OS X partition. I have no idea which version of OS X someone_ smiley is using. <comment310260> @DavidAnderson The tags suggest ElCap. <comment310289> I'm using El Capitan, sorry for not making it clear enough <comment310472> Thank you for your helps, Create a bootable installer would be one of good work around to this problem. but i have get around this problem now. Please see update to the question for details. <comment310473> I have found work around to the problem. Your method would work too as last resort. Please see update to questions for detail.
