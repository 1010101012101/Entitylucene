Listing the terminal commands available for Mac OS <body> I would like to make more use of the terminal. Is there a command I can use that could list for me all the available command of the Mac OS? I am using Snow Leopard.  <answer12646> You can hold the esc button for a few seconds (or press it or tab twice in succession). That will list everything executable in the path as well as all shell functions.  Also check out this question: Got any tips or tricks for Terminal in Mac OS X?.  This is a good introduction: Introduction to the OS X Unix Command Line.  If you type codeapropos .*/code, you will get a nice list of command and descriptions.  <answer12647> I suggest you to read a command line introduction from Apple: "Command Line Primer"   <answer13255> One way to find new commands is via manual pages.  For example codeman cd/code will take you to the man page on the codecd/code command.  At the bottom of the manual page is a "see also" section.  <answer40902> I came across a site recently that has a good list of commands:  ss64.com/osx/  A few very interesting commands listed there that I had never seen before (though not documented only, use codeman *commandname*/code locally if necessary):  codedsenableroot/codebr codedot_clean/codebr codekextfind/code, andbr codesecurity/code  Many of the commands listed on the site are not OS X specific, but a few gems in there are, including the above.  <comment13250> thanks for the answer. But I am curious, why is holding the esc button for a few seconds displays all the commands (all 1979 of them:), isn't it an odd way to show them? <comment13251> Its a form of autocompletion.  Similar to if you press any letter and then hold esc it will show you all the command starting with that letter.  You can also type apropos .*  and it will give you a nice list ;) <comment13282> I didn't know apropos had wildcarding/regex. Awesome. <comment13283> Instead of holding Esc, you can just press it, or Tab, twice. <comment16510> this depends on which shell you are using
