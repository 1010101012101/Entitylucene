Can one pan across a panorama photo that is longer than the screen in Keynote? <body> The panorama photo is displayed in the center of the view area in Keynote, cutting off both the left and right ends. I would like to have the photo displayed first from the left and then pan across to the right.  <answer99642> What you're looking for is similar to the "Ken Burns Effect", so named for the documentary director that made the technique famous.  Steps to complete in Keynote:  ol liImport an image larger than your slide, and resize as necessary, but ensuring it remains larger than the slide area./li liOn the Build Inspector, click on the Action tab and select "Move" from the Effect drop-down./li liIncrease the duration of the effect as desired./li liModify the movement path (represented by the red line over the slide) so that the end point is to the left of the start point, on a straight line./li /ol
