May I bind Mission Control's next and previous space to ctrl+mousewheel? <body> May I bind Mission Control's next and previous space to codectrl/code+codemousewheelup/code and codectrl/code+codemousewheeldown/code?  Using the system settings apparently I can't, so I'm wondering if there's another non-invasive way? (such as manually editing a config file, for instance)  OSX 10.8, in case this matters.  <answer115315> Check out BetterTouchTool. It's a free app that allows you to bind a large number of system actions to the controls on your mouse, including Mission Control and changing spaces. I have a Magic Mouse, so I'm not 100% sure that it will work with a normal mouse scroll wheel, but I'm fairly certain that it will.  <comment134987> Nice try, but apparently it doesn't allow me to bind the mouse wheel :/ <comment134989> Oh well. I guess it only works for the mouse buttons, and not actually moving the scroll wheel. Sorry.
