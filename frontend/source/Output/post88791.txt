Mail - Deleting/Hiding Exchange mailbox's (e.g. RSS Feeds) <body> We're running Exchange 2010 and I have access the server if I can make changes there.  Basically is there a way to hide or delete the RSS Feeds folder that shows up on the Mac Mail app?  When I try to delete it I get:  precodeThe mailbox “RSS Feeds” could not be deleted. The server returned the error: Distinguished folders cannot be deleted. /code/pre  You can't get rid of it from Outlook 2013 (Windows) either.  Any ideas?  I was hoping you could disable these folders from the Exchange backend but I haven't found anything yet.  <answer125273> There is a way to removed the RSS Feeds folder from Outlook 2013 using MFCMAPI http://mfcmapi.codeplex.com/ there's a youtube demo here as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g45GbCOjx0 Only difference with Outlook 2013 compared to Outlook 2010 in video was that the RSS folder was found in the the IPM_Subtree subfolder.
