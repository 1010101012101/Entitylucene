Not able to search installed Apps anymore <body> I use iphone 6s. whenever I need to run an app on iphone, I just search for the app. (using flashlight).  Off late I have noticed that whenever I search for an app, it doesn't show the installed app anymore.  I am pretty sure that this earlier the search on iphone used to show installed apps as part of search results.  Now it only shows * suggested websites * wikipedia * twitter * itunes store  Why did this behavior change?   <answer265891> I was able to solve it by reinstalling IOS on my iphone. It wasn't a very good solution, but sadly nothing else worked for me.  Apple is not very different from Microsoft after all.  <comment330578> If you check "Settings - General - Spotlight Search" on your phone are all the buttons green? <comment330612> yes I checked. everything is green there. but still when I search, it shows the "app store" and then "suggested websites" but doesn't show installed apps. Earlier it used to show... now something changed.
