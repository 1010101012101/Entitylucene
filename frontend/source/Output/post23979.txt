Native RNDIS USB tethering support for OSX <body> Android phones can be USB tethered via RNDIS protocol on Windows and Linux. As far as I understood Apple does not provide RNDIS driver for OSX.  Are there RNDIS drivers for OSX by third party (Android vendor) or community?   I don't want to use any any app for tethering, I want the real thing, as other operating systems can do it, so please no suggestions for alternative methods.  <answer53178> RNDIS is a Microsoft-proprietary protocol and it's highly unlikely that Apple is going to support it just for the sake of Android tethering.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNDIS  Your best chance is for a 3rd party to write a Mac OS X driver for RNDIS. Don't expect this to be free (as in beer) though.  However you should be able to use the Android phone as a USB dial-up modem, which was the standard way for tethering before the iPhone came about and still a supported method in OS X and others.  <answer77074> Since then, this driver has come out. It's FOSS too.  http://www.joshuawise.com/horndis  <answer102805> horndis is a brilliant solution - just started using it yesterday and it's completely stable  I couldn't get my Andriod phone to work as a USB modem.  I compiled it from source for 10.6.8 then used codepackagemaker/code and the included codepackagemaker/code project file to create a package to install.  Only gotcha was using codesudo su/code to change the ownership and permissions on the installed kext manually  precodesudo su chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext  chmod -R 755 /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext /code/pre  <comment60885> Thanks! That what I was slowly realized. Nowadays using wifi tethering. <comment127180> Tested it on Kindle 5th Generation and works like treat :) <comment188288> Just tested with Nexus 5 an Maverick. Works! <comment188289> They have binary distributions nowadays and almost works like a charm. <comment188639> That's great to hear. I haven't had a chance to test with Yosemite but I can see on GitHub that the project is still active. <comment287975> Works with Yosemite and BeagleBones, but does not yet support El Capitan.
