Numbers How to show a hidden column? <body> First time working with Numbers and I hid a column by mistake.  How do I show/unhide a column in this application?  <answer214849> Right click (or kbdcontrol/kbd + click ) on an adjacent column header letter.  For example "Column D".  Then select strongUnhide/strong from the dialog.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/82HgV.png" alt="Unhide columns"
