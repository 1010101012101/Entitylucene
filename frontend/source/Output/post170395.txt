Cannot Access Q1000 Modem <body> My Mac Pro running Lion cannot access our CenturyLink (Qwest) Actiontec Q1000 modem/router: any attempt to do so using 192.168.0.1 just dies. However, an iMac running Snow Leopard readily accesses the router using the above address. The problem with Lion (if that's what it is) is recent [But so is the password issue -- see below.]  The Mac Pro and iMac do have different versions of Intego's Virus Barrier and NetBarrier. I'm loath to take VB and NB down entirely, but maybe that's a beginning? Has anyone experienced similar issues with Lion? [Dummy should mention that the MacPro under Lion "occasionally" refuses to recognize the account password. So maybe Lion needs to be reloaded?]  <comment200339> I would take those Intego products offline and see if the problem persists, but particularly the NetBarrier. Whether to reload Lion should be posed as a separate question, with more detail about what invokes the problem and what steps you may have taken to fix it.
