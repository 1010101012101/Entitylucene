Running an OS off an external drive <body> I'm looking to do away with my Boot Camp partition. Now I've bought a 2 TB external drive, and I was wondering if it's possible to either install a Boot Camp partition onto the external drive, or failing that, how much of a performance drop I'll see if I install a VM via Parallels Desktop onto the external drive.  It's a USB 3 external drive.  My Mac is a MacBook Pro late '13, 2.4 GHz Intel i5, 8 GB of DDR3 RAM  <answer191162> It seems to be possible to install Windows 7/8 to an external drive but a lot of work is necessary to overcome Boot Camp/Windows 7/8 restrictions.  The following guide is shamelessly stolen at bleeptobleep.blogspot.de. All credits go to the the respective  persons/groups of persons.

Mac: Install Windows 7 or 8 on an external USB3 or Thunderbolt drive without using bootcamp  strongIntroduction/strong  After I received my new iMac with a 3 TB Fusion Drive, I was disappointed when I realized that Bootcamp was not running on this model and prevented me from installing Windows on it. I wanted to take advantage of the powerful iMac hardware to play games but I couldn't.br There are a few ways of working around this limitation, but I found most of them quite complex and most of the time they required formatting the internal hard drive or repartitioning it and go for a brand new installation of Mac OS X. I was not comfortable with that.br But there is another way, and that is to install Windows on an external hard drive, using either USB or Thunderbolt. Personally I used a Lacie Rugged 1 TB drive that has both USB3 and Thunderbolt connectors. Both work very well.  strongThis guide may interest you if:/strong  ul liYou have an internal hard drive of more than 2TB and you can't run bootcamp at all (like late 2012 iMacs with a 3TB drive)/li liYou have limited space or you don't want to dedicate disk space on your internal hard disk drive to a Windows installation/li /ul  strongWhat this guide will make you do:/strong  ul liIt will make you erase all your data from your external USB3/Thunderbolt hard drive/li liIt will make you install Windows on your external USB3/Thunderbolt hard drive/li liIt will make you install bootcamp drivers/li /ul  strongWhat this will not make you do:/strong  ul liIt will not make you modify anything on your internal Mac hard drive/li liIt will not make you use or install the bootcamp assistant/li liIt will not activate the Preference Pane for the default boot drive.
