Uptime since boot excluding sleep for osx yosemite? <body> How can a I get the total uptime since boot (excluding the sleep time)?  I can use the codeuptime/code command which shows how long since the last boot, but this does not differentiate between active use and sleep or hibernation.   <answer197113> As far as I know there is no simple command executed in Terminal to get your desired result.  Here is an example for a workaround to get the uptime and the sleep time(s):  precodeuptime &amp;&amp; pmset -g log|grep 'date'|grep -E ' Wake | Sleep '|grep -v 'Dark Wake' /code/pre  with date: dd/mm/yy (example: 23/07/15)  Example (10.9.5 Virtual Machine):   precodemachinename:~ user$ uptime &amp;&amp; pmset -g log|grep '23/07/15'|grep -E ' Wake | Sleep '|grep -v 'Dark Wake' 14:59  up  1:09, 3 users, load averages: 0.58 0.47 0.51 23/07/15 13:51:39 GMT+2  Sleep                  Software Sleep pid=90: Using AC                                             10 secs    23/07/15 13:51:49 GMT+2  Wake                   Wake [CDNVA] due to power-button/User: Using AC                             149 secs   23/07/15 13:54:18 GMT+2  Sleep                  Software Sleep pid=90: Using AC                                             91 secs    23/07/15 13:55:49 GMT+2  Wake                   Wake [CDNVA] due to power-button/User: Using AC                             1872 secs  23/07/15 14:27:01 GMT+2  Sleep                  Software Sleep pid=90: Using AC                                             7 secs     23/07/15 14:27:08 GMT+2  Wake                   Wake [CDNVA] due to power-button/User: Using AC /code/pre  Now do the math and calculate the non-sleep uptime. (6540 secs - 108 secs = 6432 secs).  Depending on your operating system and the hibernation mode you set, you may have to alter the grep part in the above command. Check codepmset -g log/code for the appropriate strings. You also may omit the ' Wake ' part of the command to simplfy the output.
