How to make keyboard shortcuts work for the Clipmenu application? <body> I'm using Clipmenu application to manage copy and paste tasks.  It seems to me that you can use the shortcuts: kbdcmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd, kbdcmd/kbd+kbd2/kbd to paste the copied texts, but it doesn't work though.  Let's say I copy these 4 lines in 4 times:  precode111111 222222 333333 444444 /code/pre  Then I'd like to use the shortcuts to paste every one of them. This is:  precodecmd + 1 (to paste '111111') cmd + 2 (to paste '222222')   and so on.. /code/pre  But if I press kbdcmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd I just hear a sound and nothing happens.  <answer66685> Invoke clip menu first (kbdshift/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdV/kbd by default) then use kbdcmd/kbd+kbdnumber/kbd to paste that particular item.  <comment70185> Which application are you trying to paste into? I've found issues with some other clipboard handlers in certain applications, but it works in others. You could also try pressing Cmd + V after Cmd + 1 and see if it pastes the data then. <comment70400> I'm trying to paste into a textedit file. What you say sounds to conflicts when different apps use the same shortcuts, but no shortcuts are assigned to the textedit app
