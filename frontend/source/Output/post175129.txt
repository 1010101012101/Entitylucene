LustyExplorer is not loading <body> I added lustyExplorer to ~/.vim/plugin.  Then I ran MacVim and tried to run it with ":LustyFileSystemExplorer".  Error     "Unknown Function: lustyExplorer#LustyFileSystemExplorerStart"   In the documentation it says:  precodeUsage: "                 &lt;Leader&gt;lf  - Opens the filesystem explorer. "                 &lt;Leader&gt;lr  - Opens the filesystem explorer from the "                               directory of the current file. "                 &lt;Leader&gt;lb  - Opens the buffer explorer. "                 &lt;Leader&gt;lg  - Opens the buffer grep, for searching through "                               all loaded buffers " "               You can also use the commands: " "                 ":LustyFilesystemExplorer [optional-path]" "                 ":LustyFilesystemExplorerFromHere" "                 ":LustyBufferExplorer" "                 ":LustyBufferGrep" /code/pre  I also tried code:lf/code and got Error:     can't open errorfile errors.err   Am I executing it correctly?  What does the prefix code&lt;Leader&gt;/code mean?  <answer259205> If you have dowloaded the file from github seems to be incorrect. Use the download link in the plugin page lusty-explorer.vim that works as expected  <comment206390> From the docs: "This plugin requires Vim be compiled with Ruby interpretation." So does MacVim have Ruby support? To check run: `mvim --version | grep -i ruby` <comment206392> Yes, I already checked this. <comment206406> Dead set on using this? I'm a big fan of [NERDTree](http://vimawesome.com/plugin/the-nerd-tree) for a file explorer and I recommend using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) as your plugin install in `*vim`. <comment206447> So far I've tried peepopen and lustyexplorer and both of them are broken :).  I'll try NerdTree next I suppose. <comment206537> I really recommend using `Vundle` to manage the installs of your plugins. <comment206541> @IanC. You are the second person to tell me that :).  A coworker said the same thing.  I'm going to :).
