Using search bar in safari to search a specific site <body> One can do searches from the address bar in safari. However one can only specify one search engine to use. Id really like to specify that I want the search to happen in google/youtube/wikipedia etc. Id really like to be able to do searches from the address bar in safari.  I had this in chrome a while back, and I'd love to use it in safari. Does anyone know if an extension is available to do it?  a description of the functionality can be seen in this gif: https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/09/h2-chrome-omnibox/chromebar_gif_slow_it_down/  <answer264373> You can use the same syntax in Safari's address bar as you would directly in Google etc    h1site:/h1  strongExample/strongbr codeiTunes playlist site: apple.stackexchange.com/code  strongResult/strong    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MzGUc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer264600> Omnikey does this:  Comes as a safari extension, you can download it here:  http://marioestrada.github.io/safari-omnikey/  <comment331266> Your question specifies 'search engine' but your requirement would appear to be about a site-specific parameter instead.
