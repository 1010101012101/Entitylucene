How to Turn iPad on? <body> I was watching a video on YouTube and my iPad just blanked out. I have tried charging it for one hour (like the Apple website said to), connecting it to iTunes and held the 'off/on' and the 'home' button together for a minute (roughly).   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5894688?start=0&amp;tstart=0   <answer254830> Hold the strongOff/On/strong and the strongHome/strong buttons simultaneously until you see the Apple logo on the screen.  <comment317283> Welcome to Ask Different.
