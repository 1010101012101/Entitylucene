DiskAid stuck "Checking Tracks Already in iTunes" <body> I downloaded DiskAid yesterday and am trying to move songs over from my iPod to my iMac.  There is a window that says "Checking Tracks Already in iTunes" that has been spinning since yesterday.  It seems stuck.  I do have 25,000 songs on the iPod.  Would it really take this long to check?  Or do I need to do something different?  Thanks so much!
