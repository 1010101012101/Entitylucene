Mac core fonts on Linux <body> Does anyone know where I can download Mac core fonts (e.g. those that ship with Snow Leopard/ Lion) for use on a Linux system? I'm basically looking for either a Mac font-equivalent for the 'msttcorefonts' debian package or the fonts themselves. Thanks!  <answer23293> Fonts are licensed. You can't just distribute them in the public domain. You might find some overlapping in the MS core fonts bundle, but for the rest you are out of luck.  <comment26012> Note `msttcorefonts` doesn't include CJK or anything from Vista or Windows 7.  They are available due to a licensing mistake on Microsoft's part. <comment26031> Welcome to Ask Different! Since this question is just asking where to download something, it isn't really about Apple hardware or software. Therefore, it's off-topic for this site. Thanks.
