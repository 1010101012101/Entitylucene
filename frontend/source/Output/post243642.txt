How can I get Aperture to use gmail for emailing photos? <body> I use gmail in a web browser.  I don't use Mail at all.  Except...  In Aperture if I go share - email it opens up Mail.app.  Is there a way through configuration or through a helper app to get aperture to open share by email pix in a gmail composer window?  I'm using Aperture 3.6 on Yosemite.  hr  Edit:  Currently Mail is set to have Default Mail Reader is Google Chrome.  This works for (so far) everything but Aperture.  <answer243659> To make "share by email" buttons on your Mac (system-wide!) open up in Gmail—instead of the Mail app—follow these instructions:  -Download and install Google Chrome, if it's not on your Mac already.  -Open the Mail app--yes, the stock Mail app.  -Press "Mail" on the menu-bar, in the top-left of your screen, and hit Preferences.  -Make sure you're in the General pane, and press "Choose default Email Reader".   -Choose Google Chrome from the dropdown menu.  Now your system-wide default email viewer is Gmail in the web. Let me know if this helped you!
