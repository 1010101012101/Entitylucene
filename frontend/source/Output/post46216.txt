How to switch input languages with different key combination? <body> I don't like to switch languages with kbd⌘/kbd + kbdspace/kbd. Is there any way I can use more common keyboard combinations:   ul likbdControl/kbd + kbdShift/kbd or/li likbdControl/kbd + kbdOpion/kbd or/li likbdCaps Lock/kbd/li /ul  I'd preferred the simplest solution possible. Can I just change some system settings instead of installing a software to solve this problem?  <answer46220> I already use PuntoSwitcher which does the trick but it has some annoying bugs and it's  strongonly useful for russian-speaking users/strong because UI is only in russian. That's why I want to find an alternative.  The main purpose of PuntoSwitcher is to fixe words typed with wrong keyboard layout. For example:  pre руддщ → hello ghbdtn → привет  /pre  So it may be useful for somebody who uses russian a lot (outsourcing managers, people who learn russian, etc).   <answer46221> You can change the key combination via strongSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts/strong → Keyboard &amp; Text Input:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/eNe2Y.png" alt="Screenshot"  The settings you’re looking for are the last two in the list: em“Select the previous input source”/em and em“Select next source in Input menu”/em.  <comment52760> The problem is that it's impossible to put ANY of listed in my question key kombinations there. When you click with your mouse on key combination you can replace default "⌘ + Space" with something like "⌘ + B" but nice key combinations are deliberately forbiden :( <comment54048> Are there BETTER alternatives?
