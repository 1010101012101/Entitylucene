Can I Disable the Duplicates Counter in Lion Mail? <body> I've recently switched to using Gmail via IMAP in Mail.app on Lion, and I've mostly got it configured to do what I want. However, there's one annoyance I haven't been able to fix yet. Because of Gmail's peculiarities, I have at least 2 copies of every message in my inbox - 1 in my inbox, 1 in the emAll Mail/em folder (Gmail's archive). This isn't a big deal, except that Mail seems to like to announce this fact for every message that's got a duplicate, like so: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1OJf.png" alt="Mail screenshot"  I'm aware that in Gmail's IMAP settings you can disable the emAll Mail/em folder from showing up on the client, but I like having it around for search purposes (and it doesn't solve the problem of duplicates when you label something). Is there any way, short of disabling emAll Mail/em, to get rid of this duplicate detection? Or should I just work on being less annoyed by superfluous messages?  <comment37028> I also have the exact same problem and concern (https://discussions.apple.com/message/16823327). I was hoping that there was a Terminal command that could be issued to disable this annoying "feature". I want to be able to see ALL messages, including those so-called duplicates (which, in my case, are all false positives). <comment37597> You could edit the localization files so that "2 duplicates" reads "2 other labels" instead. :-)
