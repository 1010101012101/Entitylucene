iMac running Snow Leopard won't resolve DNS <body> Having problems with an iMac that I bought today. It's a 21", 2ghz Dual Core with 4GB ram. I'm connecting to my router via ethernet, and I can load up my remote websites and servers using the ip address, but when using a domain, safari complains with "You are not connected to the internet"  It's a fresh install of snow leopard 10.6.3 - I've tried running the Network Diagnostics and it just keeps saying it can't resolve the problem.  Would appreciate any ideas.  Dave  <comment15664> Can you tell us what you have in System Preferences - Network - Ethernet - DNS Server? (you can try the OpenDNS there: 208.67.222.222) (http://www.opendns.com/) (it's free). Or Google's own DNS: 8.8.8.8 <comment15665> I tried adding google's DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 - But upon clicking Apply, everything got set back to the automatic configuration. <comment15666> could you post a sshot of your network settings please?
