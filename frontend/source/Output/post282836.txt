How do I PXE boot an Apple Mac (they do it at the Apple store it appears)? <body> I would like to PXE boot (I assuming it works similar to Windows) a Mac?  I would like to do this with an Ubuntu Image but a guide demonstrating at minimum how to boot Sierra of ethernet would be great!  <comment356514> Your question is unclear. How is PXE-Booting related to Ubuntu Live CD? Maybe [Netbooting Ubuntu Live CDs](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveCDNetboot)? And all this with Sierra? <comment356526> @klanomath I have seen Window netbooted(and heard ubuntu could do this) before so I assumed Sierra could also do this.  At minimum I would like to do what they do in the apple store and netboot onto Sierra install cd(I know it isnt technically a cd). <comment356529> @klanomath I can borrow a family members if necessary. <comment356531> This appears it might work. http://krypted.com/mac-os-x-server/configure-netinstall-services-macos-server-5-2-sierra/ <comment356532> And do you want to NetBoot or NetInstall? NetBoot is more or less a regular boot but to a NetBoot image provided by server instead of a regular boot drive. NetInstall boots to an image which lets you install an arbitrary system. macOS server is recommended. <comment356533> @klanomath I'm beginning to thinking netbooting macOS won't be possible.    Either is fine I'll edit the question if you answer and post a different question for whichever isn't covered. <comment356538> NetBoot/NetInstall is more an enterprise/service provider/forensics gizmo. If you have only one Mac and have to borrow a second it's a too big effort to set up such a server. I recommend to test in a virtual environment instead. <comment356542> @klanomath WTF?  Can't I run macOS server on my mac?  This isn't hard on Windows.  Refer to the guide above. <comment356543> Have you seen this [article](http://www.blueboxmoon.com/wordpress/?p=929)?  Netbooting a Mac is on my list of projects (very low priority) but I have done a little "research" to see if can be done. <comment356545> @Allan thank you.  I will experiment with such. <comment356559> Of course you can run macOS server, but you can't boot your only Mac that way (obviously). But to get back to your question: Can you edit it to show what you are actually trying to accomplish/which problem you are trying to solve? There is no PXE on macOS, so a question which doesn't already assume a specific solution will be easier to answer.
