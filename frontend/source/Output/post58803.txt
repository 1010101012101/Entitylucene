Macbook Air: MD232LL/A or Z0ND0002Z? <body> I'm planning to buy a new high-end macbook air and found that there're different part numbers for the same product: MD232LL/A and Z0ND0002Z. What is the difference between these two? Is it just about the released country or do they have different specs actually?    I appreciate your help in advance!  <answer58808> The two model numbers don't seem to refer to the exact same configuration. Model MD232LL/A appears to reference to the base model (as noted in Apple's MBA Model Identifier KB). The KB also notes:      If you have a custom configuration the Model Number and Configuration   in the table may not match. strongPlease use the Model Identifier to confirm   the model of MacBook Air for custom configurations/strong.   One example from Amazon - the specs include:     ul   li1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor/li   li256 GB Flash Storage/li   li4 GB DDR3 RAM/li   /ul   In the page from Decide.com, the specs for model Z0ND0002Z include:     ul   liCore i7 2 GHz /li   li8 GB RAM /li   li512 GB HDD/li   /ul   It's probably that the Z0ND0002Z model is used by retailers that provide more customization, since Apple uses the MD232LL/A model in its online KB. The excerpt from the KB also supports this conclusion.  <comment67732> Thanks for the answer, JW8. I understand your point but I'm a little bit curious how multiple (unofficial) retailers use the same unauthorized model number Z0ND0002Z. My major concern is whether this model is an official customization or an uncertified illegal retrofit. I also wonder if there could be possibility (though small) of getting an unexpected product if I order this Z0ND0002Z model. Anyway your answer was very helpful. Thanks again! :)
