Mail.app mailbox corruption <body> Once a week or so, Mail.app will not display the contents of a mail message. Selecting codeMailbox -&gt; Rebuild/code strikefixes/strike bandaids the issue until next time.  I only have one account in Mail.app, pointing to a Microsoft hosted Exchange server. This has happened consistently for the past 3 months.  What information would help to solve this problem, or what is a solution to this problem?  <answer107633> You could try deleting the "Envelope Index" files.  Run the following Terminal commands to backup and delete the files:  precodecd ~/Library/Mail/V2/ cp MailData MailData.old cd MailData rm Envelope\ Index Envelope\ Index-shm Envelope\ Index-wal /code/pre  Alternatively…  ol liQuit Mail/li liIn Finder, press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⇧ shift/kbd+kbdG/kbd  Copy and paste the following    precode~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/ /code/pre  Press kbdreturn/kbd or click Go/li liBackup then delete/move these files to the Trash:  ul liEnvelope Index  /li liEnvelope Index-shm  /li liEnvelope Index-wal/li /ul/li liRelaunch Mail and wait for messages to import./li /ol  Note: once in a while this causes a corrupted message or two to reveal itself, usually in the form of having no "From" or "Subject" in the list view of messages (at least in "Classic Layout" mode).  Sometimes a corrupted message can actually screw up the interaction between Mail and the server, even if message is corrupted not on Mac, but on the server itself! (seen happen w/ AOL).  <comment89782> I have the same problem. I hope you find an answer, it's driving me crazy.
