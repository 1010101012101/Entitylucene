Jailbroken iPhone stuck on black screen after erasing all content? <body> Yesterday, I decided to restore my iphone to factory default setting . So I format my iphone through setting menu (but the battery was low) . Then i kept my phone on charge but nothing happen. I also bought a new charger and cable but my iphone won't charge. I have been trying to reset it (holding power and home button) and I have tried putting it in safe mode but no luck .   Nothing is happening , even after charging for 2-3 hours . No logos , no indications , no buttons etc.  <answer209951> is your pc/laptop recognize the iphone (after connect to pc)?. try connect usb cable with pressed home key.   <comment253319> when you plug your iPhone do you see the charging screen ? when it's not charging and you push the power button do you see anything on the screen? <comment253326> Nope everything is black. when I plug my iphone it shows nothing . I also tried pushing power button ..nothing works . <comment253327> If you have a mac connect your iPhone through usb and run `system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep iPhone` or  just `system_profiler SPUSBDataType` and check if there is some information about your iPhone, if nothing is showing then maybe the battery is dead, try replacing it this all I can think about. <comment253330> Google DFU mode and follow the instructions, you will need iTunes. <comment253334> not recognised. <comment253335> I don't have mac. <comment253339> I tried DFU mode but nothing happens . <comment362563> I am having the same problem today, any fixes yet?
