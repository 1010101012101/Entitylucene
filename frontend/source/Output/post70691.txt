Use USB keyboard as Virtual Com Port instead of wedge? <body> I've got an RFID device that tries to simulate a keyboard, but it doesn't work on Mac OS X as far as I can tell, and I'd rather have com access anyway.  Is there something software related that I can do to get it to act like a virtual com port, or would I just have to use different hardware?  <comment82111> What kind of hardware interface does the RFID reader have? USB, 9pin serial? <comment82126> @patrix USB, sorry!
