Podcasts Playing Too Fast <body> My Podcasts are playing too fast. I have searched the web and there should be a 1x button close to the rewind button, but I do not see it. (See Attached Screenshot). I have a Iphone 5s running IOS 10. How can I slow down the play speed?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l1jzg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253572> Your screenshot is showing the Podcast widget.
