Spaces in a folder name <body> I have a foldername with a space between the name: code/Volumes/Img/Horos Data/DATABASE//code  I need to put it in a variable to use in a script.  In terminal I can use code\/code to use the folder: codecd /Volumes/Dados/Horos\ Data/DATABASE//code, but it doesn't work when I put in a variable like:  precodeDESTINY=/Volumes/Dados/Horos\ Data/DATABASE.noindex/ ls $DESTINY /code/pre  How can I put it in a variable?  <answer288935> Quotes can be used to escape spaces when assigning to a variable.  precodevar="abc def ghi" /code/pre  <answer288940> Variables or arguments on the right side of a command are subject to word spliting by the shell unless quoted. You can try the following demonstration.  precodetouch foo\ bar\ baz # ls foo\ bar\ baz foo bar baz # or ls "foo bar baz" foo bar baz # var=foo\ bar\ baz ls $var ls: bar: No such file or directory ls: baz: No such file or directory ls: foo: No such file or directory # ls "$var" foo bar baz /code/pre  <comment364927> It is not working with Quotes! IÂ´ve tried  with double and single quotes  and return a error. DESTINY=/Volumes/Dados/Horos Data/DATABASE/ error= link_stat "/Volumes/Dados/Horos" failed: No such file or directory (2) <comment364928> It worked now !!   Thank you very much!! <comment364936> ... except it's when you *use* the variable via something like `blah $var` that the POSIX word split bites you
