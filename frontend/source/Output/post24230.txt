Shutter count from NEF photo <body> I know Nikon embeds the shutter count in the EXIF of their NEF raw files.  What's the easiest way to find it?  <answer24238> Just open the photo in Preview, press Command-I (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdI/kbd) to bring up the Inspector. Click the circled i (codeⓘ/code) tab, and then the codeExif/code tab. At the bottom of the list you'll find codeImage Number/code.   strongemThis is your camera's shutter count./em/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WMBtP.png" alt="enter image description here"
