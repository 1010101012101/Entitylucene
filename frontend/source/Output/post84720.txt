Cannot ping localhost <body> I have setup a new MacBook Pro retina, things were going well but now I cannot access localhost.  precode$ ping localhost ping: cannot resolve localhost: Unknown host /code/pre  My /etc/hosts file is fine, or at least untouched.  I have tried flushing the DNS cache, and codedig localhost/code spits out  precode; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; localhost ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 50562 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;localhost.

I have even run OnyX to clean all cache etc...  <answer84741> Maybe your host file got mangled. Open a terminal, and read your hosts file:  precodevim /private/etc/hosts /code/pre  This should contain a line that maps codelocalhost/code to code127.0.0.1/code:  precode127.0.0.1   localhost /code/pre  It could be this file does not exist at all, or the line I gave above is not present. To be able to edit it you need to be superuser, i.e.:  precodesudo vim /private/etc/hosts /code/pre  or you can use any other editor besides codevim/code.  <comment97563> can you ping 127.0.0.1? <comment97570> Yep that works fine <comment97600> It seems /private/etc/hosts just opens up /etc/hosts, which contains  127.0.0.1 localhost etc... as you would expect <comment97716> do you use firewalls like little snitch?
