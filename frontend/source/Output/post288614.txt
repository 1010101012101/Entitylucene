Is there something like acpi_listen on macOS? <body> On Linux, the ACPID daemon acpid includes a command line tool named "acpi_listen" that prints ACPI events to standard output. For example, this is what it shows when I use my keyboard's volume up button and the play / pause button:  precode~$ acpi_listen button/volumeup VOLUP 00000080 00000000 K cd/play CDPLAY 00000080 00000000 K cd/play CDPLAY 00000080 00000000 K /code/pre  Is there an equivalent tool on macOS (Sierra)?
