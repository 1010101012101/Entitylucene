Email in List View on iPad Mini 2 <body> Is there an iPad email app which will display email in "list" view without showing a split screen with emails listed on the left and a mail preview on the right side?  I just recently bought an iPad Mini 2 to replace my old Samsung tablet, and I am used to seeing the full screen list of emails in the default Android app.  I don't like seeing the split screen on the new iPad with an email already open on the right side.  I want to see the list of emails, check off which ones I want to delete, and then read the others one at a time - going back to the list after I delete an email instead of automatically opening the next one.  Thank you.
