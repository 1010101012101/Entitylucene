Quickly disable the mouse <body> Sometimes in school someone comes up and takes my mouse and drags it around on the table so it causes random actions on my computer. I would want a quick way to temporarly disable the mouse by the keyboard? I don't want to pull the mouse out of the USB.  <comment261641> Frankly, I would be more concerned with the kind of people who sit next to you at school... Anyway, I take it you don't like trackpads? IMHO they're one of the best things Apple makes. Not to be pessimistic, but _just in case_ it turns out there isn't a way, you might want ask on [academia.se] or [workplace.se] (technically school is a "work"place right?) <comment261644> @Arc676 I would use the trackpad, but it's broken.
