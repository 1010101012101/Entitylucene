How do I find out my iMac display panel's manufacturer? <body> I've had problems with image retention on my late-2012 27" iMac for a few months now and Apple's "avoiding image retention" support page is useless for me.  On MacBooks, one can use this Terminal one-liner to check one's display manufacturer. Is there a similar command for iMacs? I realize that I'll have to return my iMac sooner or later because this is unacceptable, but I'd still like to know what panel I have before I do it.  <answer226161> It's an LG LM270WQ1 (SD)(F1).  One thread is here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5591164?tstart=0 And you can find replacement here: http://www.amazon.com/Apple-A1419-Screen-LM270WQ1-661-7169/dp/B00LEXN39W  <comment274597> Did that Terminal command not work when you tried it on your iMac? <comment274805> It did not. It just returned an empty string. <comment274807> Weird. If it works for MacBooks, I would assume it would work for iMacs. What version of OS X are you running? <comment274820> 10.11.3. Apparently, this just doesn't work with non-portable Macs. <comment274821> Is it always an LG panel though? Getting a "repaired" iMac with another crappy LG panel would really suck. <comment274852> @PeterW. LG has made the displays for Apple stuff for AT LEAST 15 years; I know this because when repairing an old PowerBook G4 I noticed that the display was branded LG.
