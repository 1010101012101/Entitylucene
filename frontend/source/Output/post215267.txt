Sending photos through iMessage fails on first try, but succeeds on second <body> I have my iPhone 6s set on Airplane mode, but with Wifi enabled, since I live in an area with bad cellphone reception.   When I try to send a photo to a friend with an iPhone, using iMessage, it seems that it always fails the first time... but when I press the (!) to try again, it succeeds. Why is this, and how can I fix this?
