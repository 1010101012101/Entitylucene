Quick Look audio distorted <body> When I play a song in Quick Look it sounds oversaturated and distorted. If I open it, it sounds great. What can be happening?  I noticed it with Mp3 at 320 kbps. With WAV and AAC it does not happens. I use a MacBook Air from mid 2011 with OS X 10.9.5.  <comment211746> all songs? what operating system on what device <comment211757> any particular type? mp3, aac, wav, flac? or bit rate/sample rate? <comment211854> I expander my question. I have discovered that only happens with some files, and I am trying to know what they have in common. Thanks!
