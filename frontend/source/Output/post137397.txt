Finder crashes - Maverick problems <body> After upgrading to the Maverick version, I started having many issues that I never had before.  First of all, it is very common my iMac to open in a different user (even there is no other users available, kind of a safe mode I think), where I can basically do nothing, as it says I have no permission.  Secondly, my finder keeps crashing all the time, always when I try to preview a file, doesn't matter what kind.  Thirdly, my Mail just stops sending and receiving emails sometimes.  Fourthly, but not last, after the finder crashes, I can't open any program.  At last, my iMac late 2009 i7 8Gb is has never been as fast as it used to be.  I hope I had never upgraded to the new version of Mac OS.  <comment163270> You should probably reinstall the Mavericks. <comment170787> Please run [Etrecheck](http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck) and post a copy of the report to [pastebin](http://pastebin.com).
