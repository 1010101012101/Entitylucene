Yosemite upgrade–continuous slow screen redraw <body> I recently upgraded to Yosemite, and now my laptop has the following issue:  Each and every window (the AppStore, Chrome, etc) seems to be continuously and very slowly redrawn, to the point where I can see the screen go white, and then slowly be drawn back in from the bottom to the top.  The only time when I every encountered a similar issue was when, on Ubuntu, I upgraded and lost support for my graphics card. However, I have no idea how to navigate this issue on OS X.  <answer240334> I had this problem and I solved it by resetting the PRAM/NVRAM, which is done via:  ol liShut down your Mac./li liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R. /li liTurn on your Mac./li liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound./li liHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time./li liRelease the keys./li /ol  <comment207229> Mac spec would be useful, together with at least an Activity Monitor Memory usage picture. <comment207230> Also, a system diagnosis next time it happens. Press shift+control+option+command+period and then wait at least 10 minutes (possibly three times as long if the system is wedged/swapping/slow to run code) before powering it off forcefully if need be. Lastly, can you make this happen or is it a one time / once a month thing? <comment207232> Is it just Internet apps ? <comment295359> @Buscar웃 I had the same problem and it was on every single app. From settings to chrome. <comment298033> It's been a while, so I can no longer confirm that this would've solved my problem. I'll accept your answer nonetheless, though.
