Is there a way to keep the notification open? Prevent autohide? <body> Is there a way to keep the notification bar from auto hiding?  I'd basically like to keep it open/expanded on the right side of my screen.  <comment189922> would love to know a way to get this to work. I have a few widgets with Yosemite that'd be helpful to be always displayed like World Clock when planning meetings across timezones.
