adding a pre owned macbook to support list <body> I recently bought a store return macbook pro 15 retina, in perfect condition on eBay and Apple's 1 year warranty has not expired on it.  Now I want to addd it to my list of Apple products for support. "It" asks me for the original purchase date.   What can I do to add it to my name / apple ID?  <answer75770> You'll most likely need to contact Apple to do this. Give 'em a call at 1-800-APL-CARE (1-800-275-2273) or use the Express Lane to speed up the process a bit.
