Open the drive and navigate to the volume date &amp; directory that you are interested in.  <answer243601> ol liHit “enter Time Machine”/li liPress the key combination shift-command-C/li liThen (very important) select a red bar to go back in time Explanation: dull red bars represent backups you cannot access, bright red bars you can/li liThen from Macintosh HD navigate to desired folder you want to restore Backups will now be accessible and you can select the folder you want to restore./li /ol  <comment254134> You don't need a specific full backup to restore from, it will restore to the last incremental; that's the whole point of incremental backups. <comment254140> Full probably means complete (as in run successfully) here, and the red one didn't complete and is unrecoverable. <comment254152> I _think_ those bars have been red since Yosemite; before Yose, they were purple. It's glowing because you have your mouse cursor hovering on it. Just FYI, next time you do an OS X install or upgrade, push ⌘+L to open the log and see if it's still working. I do this every time now. Often, the progress bar seems stopped (even for several hours), but the log will have messages scrolling by to assure you it's still working. …Or, at the very least, you can see that there are no errors and the install is probably still progressing. <comment255370> So guys, does this mean that backup is lost ? anyway I can recover. And thanks for the advice for next install but pls help me out if there is anything that can be done to recover now ?
