Command Tilde not working <body> I'm using MacBook pro 15 with Yosemite 10.10.3.  I can't get CMD + Tilde to work. In keyboard shortcuts it appears to be on.   What's the problem here?  <answer199063> The tilde key was placed in a different place in the keyboard than the place I'm used to. Works like charm.  <comment238413> Need more info, pictures... What/where/when... BTW, Cmd/~ can't be done using 2 keys, as it's a shifted character <comment238415> @Tetsujin, in all apps (finder, xcode, safarai, chrome) I can't switch between opened windows. <comment238416> Lol, I just plugged in external keyboard and it works; apperantely I used different keyboard layout so the tilde was placed differently on the keyboard. <comment238417> Switch between open Windows is Cmd ` not Cmd ~ anyway, glad you figured it out <comment238465> @Tetsujin It's also Cmd + â‡§ + ` (or Cmd + ~). It just goes in reverse order. Just like Cmd + Tab to switch apps, and Cmd + Shift + Tab to switch reverse order. Shift + some shortcut works with a lot of command. Like Undo: Cmd + Z; Redo: Cmd + Shift + Z...
