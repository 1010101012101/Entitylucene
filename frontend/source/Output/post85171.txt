What's a reasonable page size for PDFs that are likely to be read on an iPad? <body> I might temporarily change the page size of a colleague's Microsoft Word document, to produce a PDF – with an assumption that some users will read the PDF on an iPad or comparable device.   h1Page size/h1  What's reasonable?   hr  h2Margins/h2  If there are neither headers nor footers, I'll probably set 0.25 inch at all four edges.   h2File size/h2  For the Word content that I have in mind, file size is not a concern.   <comment98135> Are you interested in MB per page or the physical dimensions of the canvas? I've never even seen the latter cause an issue since the reader can scale the page to fit and most PDF have adequate resolution to scale. Now, long documents with huge embedded scans is another story - slower CPU with less RAM choke on enormous PDF. <comment98137> It you want to allow the user to read on different size screens it might be better to provide an HTML version rather than pdf
