Xcode vs TextEdit “Find and Replace…” <body> The default hotkey behavior in both Xcode and TextEdit “Find and Replace” is:br Find... kbd⌘F/kbdbr Find and Replace... kbd⌘⌥F/kbd  However, in TextEdit, the dialog for “Find and Replace” remains even after you press kbd⌘F/kbd. In Xcode kbd⌘F/kbd hides the “Find and Replace” section of the dialog and only displays the “Find” part.  In TextEdit, kbd⌘F/kbd sets the focus (which means your text marker is in the box) in the “Find” textbox. kbd⌘⌥F/kbd sets the focus in the “Find and Replace” textbox. Pressing kbd⌘⌥F/kbd followed by kbd⌘F/kbd keeps the entire dialog open. In Xcode the focus is ALWAYS in the “Find” dialog, no matter what hotkey you invoked it with.  I prefer the TextEdit behavior, but would also like consistency. Is there any way to make Xcode behave as TextEdit in this regard?  <answer178756> Here is a Part solution for setting the focus for kbd⌘⌥F/kbd  Save this Applescript down as a strongText/strong file instead of a script.  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript tell application "Xcode" to activate delay 0.5 tell application "System Events"      tell process "Xcode"          keystroke "z" using {command down, option down}         delay 0.3          keystroke tab     end tell end tell /code/pre  In terminal.app  Make the script file executable by running   codechmod  +x /path/to/foo.applescript/code  hr  In Xcode  go to the Preferences- Key Bindings Tab.    And change the strongFind and Replace (menu)/strong 's hotkey to strong⌘⌥z/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bz8fo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Now still in Preferences go to the strongBehaviours/strong Tab  Click the '+' button to add a new custom Behaviour.  Name it and give it the hotkey strong⌘⌥f/strong  On the right hand pane of the strongBehaviours/strong Tab scroll down to the bottom  And using the strongRun/strong  dropdown strongchoose script/strong. Select your Script file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zeoqe.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now you can use the kbd⌘⌥F/kbd and the find and replace will appear and focus will go to the replace field.  hr  As to replicating the keeping the Replace in view if it is already showing when you hit  kbd⌘F/kbd.  I think that in most cases it is redundant because you will want to still hit kbd⌘⌥F/kbd to get back to the replace field and the Find's text field will still be show with the changes you just made.  <comment211882> I had no idea you could use scripts like that in Xcode. And I agree on your final point, though it would be nice to have a visual representation of what’s happening without having to always use `⌘⌥F` and subsequently `⇧↹` several times… Your answer suffices for my usage, at least. Thanks a lot!
