How to get Google Drive to always show file sync status icons and right click menu? <body> I have Google Drive for Mac installed and I want to have the icons like the green checkmark appear to show whether files are synced, and the right-click context menu with codeView with Google Drive/code and codeShare using Google Drive/code. But, they go away periodically and won't come back.  The only way that I know of to bring them back is to click on the codeGoogle Drive/code menubar icon  code.../code icon  codePreferences/code  codeAdvanced/code  codeShow file sync status icons and right click menu/code.Â Turn that off, click codeApply/code, then go back to the same place and turn it on again and click codeApply/code. That seems to stick for a few hours and then it goes away again.  The only other thought I have is from List view in Finder is broken and a few other Finder-related problem reports that talk about codeGoogleDriveIpcPipe/code in console. I looked and found this in my console codesystem.log/code:  code Jun 15 23:50:19 Simons-MacBook-Pro Google Drive[90469]: GsyncAppDeletegate.py : Finder debug level logs : False Jun 15 23:50:19 Simons-MacBook-Pro Google Drive[90469]: Main bundle path during launch: /Applications/Google Drive.app Jun 15 23:50:19 Simons-MacBook-Pro FinderSyncAPIExtension[90479]: Loading Google Drive Finder extension Jun 15 23:50:19 Simons-MacBook-Pro FinderSyncAPIExtension[90478]: Loading Google Drive Finder extension         productID=com.google.GoogleDrive         xc=&lt;KSPathExistenceChecker:0x1003119f0 path=/Applications/Google Drive.app&gt; Jun 15 23:50:19 Simons-MacBook-Pro FinderSyncAPIExtension[90478]: /Users/simon/Library/Application Support/Google/Drive/GoogleDriveIpcPipe is a symbolic link to /Users/simon/Library/Group Containers/google_drive/tmpVLCwpM, connecting to link target.
