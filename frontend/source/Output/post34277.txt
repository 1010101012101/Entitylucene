Enable multi touch feature in windows7 <body> I've installed a windows7 with BootCamp 3.2 64-bit on my macbook pro but multi touch feature is not enables in trackpad and magic mouse.  Is it possible to enable features like zoom, or moving backwards or forwards in the browser?  <comment39121> Which multitouch features are you asking about? Things such as swipe between Spaces aren't going to work in Windows because the features themselves (Spaces, Mission Control, etc.) don't exist... <comment39122> Some features like zoom, backward or forward, windows has these features.
