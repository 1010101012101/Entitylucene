How can I find out what is taking up space on my hard drive? <body> I have a tiny hard drive - 128 GB. I am not that technical. I see that other files under storage is taking up say 40 GB of space. My boyfriend got me a WD NAS hard drive and I was able to move my photos from iPhoto, and iTunes, there to free up some space.   I accidentally deleted iPhoto so in order to install it.   My boyfriend showed me a script that showed the size of some big directories.     .3G   /Applications/iMovie 9.0.9/iMovie 9.0.9.app/Contents/Resources      1.3G  /Applications/iMovie 9.0.9/iMovie 9.0.9.app/Contents      1.3G  /Applications/iMovie 9.0.9/iMovie 9.0.9.app      1.3G  /Applications/iMovie 9.0.9      2.0G  /Applications/iMovie.app/Contents      2.0G  /Applications/iMovie.app      5.3G  /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport      5.3G  /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app/Contents      5.3G  /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app      1.1G  /Applications/iPhoto.app/Contents/Resources      1.3G  /Applications/iPhoto.app/Contents      1.3G  /Applications/iPhoto.app      1.0G  /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office      1.2G  /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011   Can i delete the iMovie directory and maybe download it at a later time?  Is there a better way to figure out where all the space is being taken up?   Like lets say I had an 18 GB zip file saved on my desktop. Theoretically that would be under the other space category but OS X isn't helping make me aware of that file. How do I find big files like that? Mind you i don't have a 18 GB zip file sitting around but I am trying to find if I have any big files sitting around to delete.  <answer192602> I highly recommend using:  http://daisydiskapp.com   .. Once downloaded and installed they have a "Test Drive" option you click that lets you use it for free.  Please note that to see emall/em files on your HD that all users own, you will want to use the "Scan as Administrator" option, which will prompt you to enter your password.  There is also:  ul liDisk Inventory X - http://www.derlien.com/li liDisk Map - Google for "Disk Map OS X" ( Commercial software )/li /ul  <answer192627> I use Grand Perspective for checking what is hogging disk space. Its a good visual tool - try it out - http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/  <answer192630> h1du/h1  You can use the commandline to help you out with this. I prefer a one-liner such as this one:  precodesudo du -h /Users 2&gt;/dev/null | grep '^\s*[0-9]\+G' /code/pre  This might be intimidating in the beginning, but it is fairly simple. You can find an explanation on what each part does here: explainshell.com. But in short, it uses a user with admin rights to check the size of each file in code/Users/code, only the files starting that are more than 1GB are reported back to the user.  Output looks like this:  precode 12G    /Users/SisterMorphine  11G    /Users/CousinCocaine/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/36f7b86ae0c012ea81226714036c4453ad86e67a  11G    /Users/CousinCocaine/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup  11G    /Users/CousinCocaine/Library/Application Support/MobileSync  19G    /Users/CousinCocaine/Library/Application Support  29G    /Users/CousinCocaine/Library  45G    /Users/CousinCocaine  11G    /Users/PabloPicasso/Library  12G    /Users/PabloPicasso/Pictures/PabloPicasso 2015.photoslibrary/Masters/2015/05/16/20150516-111947  21G    /Users/PabloPicasso/Pictures/PabloPicasso 2015.photoslibrary/Masters/2015/05/16  24G    /Users/PabloPicasso/Pictures/PabloPicasso 2015.photoslibrary/Masters/2015/05  36G    /Users/PabloPicasso/Pictures/PabloPicasso 2015.photoslibrary/Masters/2015  36G    /Users/PabloPicasso/Pictures/PabloPicasso 2015.photoslibrary/Masters  37G    /Users/PabloPicasso/Pictures/PabloPicasso 2015.photoslibrary  37G    /Users/PabloPicasso/Pictures  53G    /Users/PabloPicasso 110G    /Users /code/pre  <comment229213> You can use iCloud for free, the Google drive for free to upload your stuff and free some space. <comment229252> Are you using Yosemite? One thing you can delete is the Install OS X Yosemite.app bundle. <comment229278> 'Disk Inventory X' has later become 'Grand Perspective' <comment229279> Offcouse you can choose the run the same command on `/` or `/Applications` <comment229351> Ah, thank you @CousinCocaine - Link for Grand Perspective is http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/
