samples on Garageband on the iPhone? <body> Is it possible to import samples into the iPhone version of Garageband?  I have see that its possible to do this on the iPad &amp; mac version but I am not sure if I can do it on the iPhone.  <answer50785> Yes, you can import audio files into the iPhone version of Garageband.  Here are the instructions from Apple.  <comment58197> Do you mean "samples" as in something you can play in a virtual musical instrument, or do you mean any audio recording that you want to place in an audio track for mixing?
