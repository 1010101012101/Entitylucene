How to escape spaces in the results of `mdfind`? <body> I'd like to find some file with codemdfind/code and move it to another directory. So I tried like below but it makes an error caused by the space in the path.  precode&gt; mdfind somefile.numbers  /Users/hugh/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Numbers/Documents/somefile.numbers &gt; mv $(!!) ~/Documents/ mv: rename /Users/hugh/Library/Mobile to /Users/hugh/Documents/Mobile: No such file or directory mv: rename Documents/com~apple~Numbers/Documents/somefile.numbers   to /Users/hugh/Documents/somefile.numbers: No such file or directory /code/pre  So I tried to escape the space with codeprintf %q/code, but it escapes everything.  precode&gt; mv $(printf %q $(mdfind somefile.numbers)) ~/Documents/ mv: rename /Users/hugh/Library/MobileDocuments/com\~apple\~Numbers/Documents/somefile.numbers    to /Users/hugh/Documents/somefile.numbers: No such file or directory /code/pre  There must be a good way to handle this but I cannot find one. Any ideas?  <answer205630> Quote the variable:  mv "$(!!)" ~/Documents/  <comment247934> You should test the results of mdfind before attempting to move the file. But if you want to live dangerously then `mv "$(mdfind somefile.numbers)" ~/Documents`.
