Is there any limit to create Apple ids through iTunes on a computer? <body> I need to know that is there any Apple account/id creation limit through iTunes from a computer?  <answer129115> Not that I know of. And if there is, you can always switch between multiple iTunes libraries you create on the same PC via the SHIFT + Start feature.   How many are you looking at creating?  <answer228585> There is no limit of Apple ID creating attempts through iTunes on the MAC computer. I personally helped more than 80 people to create a new Apple ID without credit card. No problem! There is a limit of 3 attempts for Apple ID activation on any Apple gadget (iPhone, iPad, iPod or MAC). Activation process occur when you enter new Apple ID account info into Settings  iCloud for the first time. This limit can not be reset... Even if you ask Apple support team, they will refuse to do that.  <comment150221> Enlighten us, why would you like to know that?
