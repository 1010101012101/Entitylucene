USB SuperDrive Issue <body> How can I get the USB Super Drive model A1379 to work with my Mac Pro Quad Core computer?  I rebooted my computer, searched for drives - could not locate it on the Apple computer.  Apple support stated bad drive.  I exchanged the drive and started over with reboot.  This operation did not help.  <answer100441> Unfortunately, the Apple USB SuperDrive will not work with a Mac Pro. Check the System Requirements here.  There are hacks you can try - but it may be better in this case to get a different (3rd party) drive.
