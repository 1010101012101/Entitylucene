Stop Docker from automatically starting on startup <body> I installed Docker on OS X, and now it automatically loads every time I log in. Is there a way to stop this?  <answer251807> Click the Docker icon in the right hand side of the menu bar, and click "Preferences". In the dialog that appears, untick "Automatically start Docker when you log in".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ZNZk.png" alt="Screenshot"  <comment313307> Why the downvotes? <comment313646> Do you know what's causing it to run? It's not one of the Login Items (in System Preferences).
