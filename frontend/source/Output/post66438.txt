iPhone/Google contacts switched from Exchange to CardDAV but one way sync only <body> Having read the answers to Is it better for iOS to sync Gmail contacts using Exchange ActiveSync or the CardDAV protocol?, I switched off Contacts on the Exchange account, and set up CardDAV following Google instructions. Google is set as the default account on the iPhone. I have nearly instantaneous updates from the iPhone to Google. But I've waited a couple of hours and have yet to see a new contact and an update to an existing contact that I made via web Gmail show up on the phone. Is there a setting I'm missing? Per Google help, I already checked that the Account is on, and that I am using SSL. I'm on iOS 6.0.  Well, seven hours later I have the updates on the phone. Is this the norm?  <answer68830> This is not normal. I just set up Google CardDav on my iPhone 4. I was adding a contact to Google that was already in my iPhone. While I was reading the info off my phone and typing it into Gmail, it showed up immediately on my phone.   I can't tell you why your contacts are not updating immediately, but it is definitely not normal.   <answer68833> My understanding is that CardDAV does not push changes from server to clients, but rather requires that clients poll the server. Perhaps you have polling turned off?  ol liLaunch strongSettings/strong./li liSelect strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong./li liSelect strongFetch New Data/strong./li liUnder the strongFetch/strong heading, is strongManually/strong selected?

I reset the iPhone, and it immediately synced all the missing contacts. I haven't had any problems since.
