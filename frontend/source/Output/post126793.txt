Triple Boot 2010 Macbook Pro with Dual Drive <body> I have a 2010 Macbook pro running Mavericks and Windows 7 on a 250gb SSD. I just removed the cd drive and installed my old 250 gb hard drive. So now I have two drives. I would like to make the hard drive purely for a linux distribution.  How should I go about doing this?  Some things to note/ consider: 1.   I have no CD drive so I would like to boot up from a USB. 2.   I read that Mavericks has issues with dual booting. So I can't trust many sources? 3.   What file format should I erase the new drive to. 4.   Also should I use rEFInd for booting purposes? 5.   I am aware there are plety of tutorials that walk you through installing linux but I want to have      A second hard drive JUST for linux.  My current plan is: Reformat drive with Mac OS Extended (journalized).... Install rEFInd.... Burn ubuntu ISO to flash drive... install ubuntu though rEFInd?  I have no clue if this is at all correct  Thanks in advance...  <answer143686> Save yourself a lot of pain (and time) by using virtual machines. VMware Fusion is $50 and lets you run multiple Mac OS, multiple Windows OS, linux, DOS etc. all at the same time.  I do web development, so I need to use Internet Exploder in 4 different versions. I can't do that on one boot, but I can have 3 instances of windows open at once. My job would take a LOT longer if I had to multi-boot my machine.  <comment169233> This is an answer to an old question. But may help newcomers having the same problem. Thank you for your attempt to help.
