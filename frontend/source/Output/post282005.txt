Is there an App for determining the current capacity of an Apple watch battery? <body> I see from Mactracker that a new battery has a capacity of 205 mAh (38mm Apple Watch Series 1). For the MBP and iPhones I have used coconutBattery to show the decay in battery capacity over the lifetimes. Is there a similar tool for the watch?  <comment355021> See [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for important guidelines that should be followed when asking for a software recommendation. It will help everyone by preventing unnecessary answers for items that don't fit your request. <comment356130> Nobody? Is there perhaps an API call? I might be able to install my own mini App for it.
