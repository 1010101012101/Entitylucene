How to show app ad's only to new users? <body> I have an app in the appstore that used to be paid and with no ads.   I want to upload an update, make the app 'free', add ad's, that could be removed by purchasing "No ads 'in-app purchase'".   Problem:   I don't want users that have paid for the app before to update the app and see ads.   I want to grant "No ads 'in-app purchase'" for users who is updating the app.   Basically, if a person is updating, then no ads is 'purchased' by default.  If a person in downloading the app for the first time, he gets ads.   Is this possible? Any workarounds?   Thank you  <answer206991> You could update the paid app to set a preference that the user has the paid version. Then update the app with the free version.  <comment249632> That sounds interesting. Do I get it right, If a user skips the first update, he will get the ads anyway? <comment249656> @user40 yes, the user will get ads. It was the best I could come up with.
