Disable special characters such as Tilde <body> I am using my Mac to write Java code in Eclipse. Not frequently, but commonly enough I need special characters such as ^, ~ or `. The problem with these is that I have to press the key(-combination) followed by a space in order to insert the character, since these keys are used to create special characters such as ã or è. However, this is really impractical since I can't use them in Java anyway.  Is there a way to disable this feature globally on OS X Yosemite (german keyboard layout)?  <comment206107> So, for example, you want option + n to produce tilde right away without a space being required? <comment206108> Exactly. Pressing Option+n generates an 'underlined' tilde character, and pressing another key such as 'a' replaces the underlined tilde with 'ã'. <comment206139> I don't know any way to disable that except by creating a custom keyboard layout.  The apps for that are Ukelele and Karabiner.  You could do text replacement entries in system prefs/keyboard/text, but that would normally still require an extra space.
