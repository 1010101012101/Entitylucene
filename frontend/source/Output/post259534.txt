Is there someway to get a list of all missing photos from the photo library? <body> I get the following error in Photos app on my Mac.  precodeMissing File Photos with unavailable original files cannot be opened. The original photo “IMG_3076.JPG” is either offline or cannot be found. Click “Find Original” to reconnect. /code/pre  I want to follow the instructions from how to avoid getting missing file error in photos, so my question now is, brstrongIs there some way to get all missing files from Photos library?/strong It is going to be impossible to double click every photo to find out if it is missing. I need just the directories, i can place them back one by one and consolidate.  <answer295225> strongShort answer:/strong you can use the script in this GitHub repo.  strongLong answer:/strong  I had the same question, and it turns out that the photo library is backed by a SQLite database under the covers. On your machine, you can find the database file at code&lt;photo library root&gt;/database/photos.db/code. There's a table called codeRKMaster/code, with a row for every photo, and a codefileIsReference/code column that tells you whether the photo is "external" or not.  The script I linked to simply dumps the list of all external files, and then iterates through to check that each one exists on disk.  Note that the table also includes an codeisMissing/code column, but this is strongnot/strong good enough by itself.  It only tells you about the files that Photos "knows" are missing, because you tried to double-click them, or use them in some way.  If you simply delete a file from disk, but don't try to access it in Photos, the codeisMissing/code column will be false.  <comment324707> I had an idea, but I can't really test it. If you copy all *potentially* missing photos into one single directory, maybe on an external disk, then attempt to consolidate... I wonder whether it will look in that directory for all, once one has been discovered there manually. iTunes can do a similar thing, afaik. <comment324723> Let me try this, I have copied the Photo Library to the backup drive that has the folder structure in place, I will try to open that and run a consolidate on that copy (the one on the external hard drive). Will that work?
