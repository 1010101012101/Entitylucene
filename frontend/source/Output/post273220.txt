iMessage switch from phone number to iCloud with NORMAL settings <body> All my iMessages suddenly started sending from my iCloud address instead of my phone number this morning. I checked my settings in the "send and receive" feature and it correctly says "start new conversations from: xxx-xxx-xxxx (my phone number) so I don't understand why this was happening. For me everything is in one convo but for my friends receiving my texts there are two separate convos--one with my phone number and one with my iCloud address. If they switch back from the iCloud address convo to the phone number convo and then I text them back they receive my messages from my phone number so all is well. However, even if I try to start a new convo it sends from my iCloud address (for all the people I have texted today)  I want to ensure that everyone I am texting is getting my messages from my phone number and NOT my iCloud address but I do not have the power to switch back to that phone number conversation for all the people I have texted today. Any ideas of what to do?Â   <comment343538> I believe to switch from iCloud account to your number, you will propably have to delete your previous conversations and start over with pre-checked settings (that your number is definitely chosen) and start new conversations. This behavior is unknown to me, but maybe there are others who have had those kind of issues before.
