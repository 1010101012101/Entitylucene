Why does using Passbook with the App Store result in a connection error? <body> I upgraded my iPhone 4S to iOS 6.0. Every time I open Passbook, then touch the 'App Store' button, the App Store app is opened, but then I see the error "Cannot connect to iTunes Store". The App Store app works fine for other purposes if I open it from the home screen.  Does anyone know why I might be getting this error? If it's relevant, I'm in the UK.  <answer64986> Ah, OK, I think I found a resolution. It's still not quite clear why this works or why there is a problem, but:     ol   liFirst, head to the Settings in your iPhone./li   liClick on General./li   liNext, head to Date and Time which is down the list./li   liOnce you’re in there, you’ll want to change Set Automatically to Off./li   liGo to Set Date &amp; Time./li   liClick on Today’s Date. Once you do that, you’ll be given the option to change the date./li   liMove the year one year forward to 2013./li   liThis will prevent the error from happening. If you wish to change the date back to the real date, simply set Set Automatically to On and   everything will return to normal./li   liHead into Passbook and marvel at the apps./li   /ol   (source)  That fixes the issue on my phone.  <comment76315> There are probably no Passbook apps for UK. <comment76321> I also get the same ‘Cannot connect to the iTunes Store’ notification when opening the App Store from Passbook. I’m in the U.S. Very frustrating!
