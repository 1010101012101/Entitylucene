best free software to make/open rar files <body> Which is the best software to open/make rar files in Mac OS?  I am new to Mac and I want to open rar files.  <answer15669> The Unarchiver will open them and almost any other compression format.  <answer15673> The Unarchiver is probably the most highly regarded piece of OS X software out there for expanding archives.  SimplyRar is free and can help you create RAR files, but the developer doesn't seem to be active any more. Not sure how well it works in the latest OS X release.  RarMachine from CandyWare is $8 and can do RAR archive creation. That's pretty close to free.  Entropy looks pretty snazzy. But $18.  RAR is a proprietary, closed source format. You usually have to license it to build a tool that creates RAR files. They make the unarchiving available for free because it helps them sell licenses for archiving. Hence RAR-emcreation/em utilities rarely being free, but unarchivers being available for free.  <answer15701> I just found this application: http://archiverapp.com. Looks promising!  <comment17043> You also have unrarx http://www.unrarx.com/ but only for decompression, I would also like to know of an app to compress as .rar, which your post doesn't say... <comment17063> I just tried SimplyRar with OS X 10.5.8 and it works great! <comment47257> @jackJoe I don't know any way to make rar files on the Mac, but some of the other answers have ideas.
