This may help you to delete the partition.   <comment359414> I know this, but boot camp not detected Win10. Programs dont detected this partition. <comment359424> Ok, you  should have included that in your question. Since I don't have this issue I don't know personally what you can do... Except if you haven't tried with Disk Utility. <comment359539> Have you tried that? <comment360273> I removed it by rEFInd. <comment360291> If it is done, post an Answer explaining what you did, in order to help other people who might have the same issue.
