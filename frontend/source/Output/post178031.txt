How can I get them back.  Doesn't look like I had mine backed up.  Please help.  <answer178043> If you have were using your account before syncing with your husbands account, you probably would have your contacts backed up to the iCloud - under your account.  If that is the case  ol liGo to settings and /li liTurn off syncing contacts to the cloud. /li liSave (nonexistent) contacts on the phone. /li liBack out of settings/li liGo back in and turn syncing contacts to the Cloud back on... /li /ol  Here's a test to perform - using a computer's browser, log into icloud.com (using your Apple ID) and go to the Contacts page.  If they are gone, then they are gone.   <comment210967> Thank you for your help.  I did not have my own itunes acct. prior to this.  I know my info has to be somewhere and will use your suggestions. <comment211123> If you didn't already have your own account, the info is likely gone; you just overwrote it with another account.
