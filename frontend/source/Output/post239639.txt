Cannot boot into OS X after partitoning <body> I have installed Ubuntu on a Mac Mini, everything works great. I'm able to switch back and forth without any problems. After that, I used GParted in Ubuntu to resize the OS X partition. I then create a FAT32 partition from a unallocated partition which was resized in previous step.br/  The result look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kF40I.png" alt="Partitions"  All of the procedures were done successfully without any errors, but after restart I cannot boot into OS X again, whereas the Ubuntu still alright. I tried to remove the FAT32 partition but still no positive.br/ How can I make OS X work again? (please don't hate me, I didn't make a backup since I don't have any significant data on OS X). I've been googling around and the solution seems to reinstall from Recovery. Is there any other ways other than reinstall?  br/ Environment:br/ Mac Minibr/ Dual-boot: Mac OS X 10.11 and Ubuntu 14.04 br/ Here's a little more partitions list:br/  precodesudo fdisk -l /dev/sda /code/pre  This command does not show the partition 5 and 6. I don't know why img src="https://s33.postimg.org/onilws11r/fdisk_l.png" alt="fsidk -l"  precodesudo lsblk -o /dev/sda /code/pre  img src="https://s33.postimg.org/jz2m1lbv3/lsblk_o.png" alt="lsblk-o" br/All of above commands are executed in linux.  <comment294199> Have you tried removing the FAT32 partition and then booting up? <comment294207> When you say to created the FAT32 partition, where did you create it?  When you boot into recovery, can you go into terminal and execute the command `diskutil list` and then paste the result to your question?  It helps to know what we are looking at. <comment294468> Please add your system version and the output of `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` and `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` to your question! <comment294534> @klanomath Thanks for reminding me. But I'm not with the Mac right now, I added a few details which I'm able to run on linux.
