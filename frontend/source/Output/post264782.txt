Software for dual monitor setup with one screen is partially covered <body> Using a second screen (Asus ProArt PA248Q) with my Macbook Pro makes life much easier, but I've found that using the screens side by side makes it either awkward to type or hurts my neck.  So, I'm looking to use my screens in the following configuration:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ayTfM.jpg" alt="Screen configuration"  However, there is clearly part of the upper monitor that is obstructed by the laptop screen. Is there any sort of software that could strongblend the two overlapping screens/strong?
