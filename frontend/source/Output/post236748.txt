Messed up my 1TB Fusion drive on my iMac with Disk Utility <body> Soooo something bad happened recently with my 1 TB Fusion drive on my 5K late 2015 iMac. I was creating a new 100 GB partition on my disk. So while the disk utility was busy scanning etc (doing its stuff). The power at my home suddenly went off so this got interrupted... When I rebooted my iMac back the disk size shows like this..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bkaVC.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see it shows 1 TB on the left side as it supposed to.. But it thinks it only got a 306.34 GB disk size after the interruption.. What happened to the other space..? In Disk Utility it only shows 1 partition.  I ran a few tests in Terminal.app with these outputs:  strongdiskutil list/strong  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         24.0 GB    disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            23.6 GB    disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3 /dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +306.3 GB   disk2                                  Logical Volume on disk1s2, disk0s2                                  5C3ED08A-8DA2-405E-BFC5-E84CF864742F                                  Unencrypted Fusion Drive /dev/disk3 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            W10PRO.VLX64.MULTi7... +3.7 GB     disk3 /code/pre  strongdiskutil list disk0/strong  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  strongsudo gpt -vv -r show /dev/disk0/strong  precodegpt show: /dev/disk0: mediasize=1000204886016;

I need the whole 1 TB of space for work/school and personal stuff..  Any help is highly appreciated!  <answer237252> I eventually made a call with Apple support. They asked me to use the option first aid in Disk Utility, this didn't help. They then asked me to reboot my iMac in recovery mode and do the same thing again. This also didn't help.   After these two options to repair my partition, they asked me to back-up whole drive and reinstall OSX. They told me that this would definitely work because the hard drive was a fusion drive, part mechanic and part ssd.. Can't remember the exact details on why this would work thought... But i reinstalled my whole OSX and got my 1TB back. :).   <comment289801> Can you show me the result of `diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk2 limits`? <comment289802> @Frizlab I get the following error when i enter it in the terminal: Error obtaining resizing information: disk is a Core Storage Logical Volume <comment289804> Ha yes. I did not work with CoreStorage (Fusion) much… Try `diskutil coreStorage list` for me please, I think it will be much more relevant than the `diskutil list` you did ;) <comment289805> @Frizlab i updated the previous image with the results of the new command results. (I can only post 2 links because of my low points). <comment289806> Try `sudo diskutil cs resizeLV disk2 0`. Tell me if it works, I'll post a more complete answer you could accept, explaining why it works, what is going on, etc. <comment289808> @Frizlab Getting the following error:  The Core Storage Logical Volume UUID is 5C3ED08A-8DA2-405E-BFC5-E84CF864742F Started CoreStorage operation Error: -69674: The provided Core Storage logical volume has an incorrect size; you should run whole-disk repair <comment289810> Mmmmh… Stupid idea: did you try repair the disk? In Disk Utility, select your hard drive (at the top-most level) and click on the First Aid button. <comment289813> @Emre Please post Terminal output as text and not as screenshot <comment289843> @Frizlab Yes i did. It checking severals things and eventually saying "operation succesfull" <comment289845> @klanomath Sorry for the inconvenient, updated my question with text output! <comment289877> There goes my knowledge… I don't know why all the space is not retrieved, sorry. I encourage you to check this answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/168744/17436. The case is not exactly the same but you might find relevant informations. Good luck! <comment289881> @Frizlab I'll look further, thanks for the effort to help me out! <comment289944> Maybe try just reformatting the drive (after taking your data off of it) with Disk Utility and starting over?
