Spotify Account on Iphone <body> Can i use my normal (on the website created) Spotify Premium Account on the iPhone or do I have to purchase Premium on iTunes/the Appstore ?  <answer195161> You can use the Spotify premium account on the iPhone, and you should.br At least where I live (Chile) you save approx 40% on the monthly subscription by buying it directly with Spotify instead of an in-app purchase.  <comment232993> Thank you :) I was concerned if there is a difference between an online created Account and an in-App created Account. But i didnÂ´t know that my Online Account is cheaper than the in-App Account
