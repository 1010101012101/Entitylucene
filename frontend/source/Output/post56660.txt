My Macbook Air won't connect to the internet <body> I have a Macbook Air I bought in November 2011, v 10.7.4 and I have issues connecting to the internet. Though the wifi symbol shows that I have a strong connection, I have no internet access. The only way to get it is to shut down my laptop, and reset my router by turning the power off and waiting for a bit then turning it back on. I know I don't have a problem with my router/internet access as other users in my flat have no trouble. Anyone have any idea what the trouble is?  <answer56693> Things to check:  ol liIf you are using WIFI only, you need to set the Service Order and the first will be your WIFI./li /ol  From System Preferences  Network  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzl2p.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then Click "Set Service Order"  Drag and drop the WIFI connection to the top of the order list  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lnfww.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liOn your Network Settings  Wifi  Advanced  DNS, add your Router IP there./li /ol  HTH  <comment65076> Hi, I have a number of questions.   1. Did you ever have a wifi connection? If so, has something changed?  2. If you connect your computer through Ethernet, does that work?  3. If you take you computer to a Starbucks or equivalent, do you get wifi access?  4. Can you update your question with a screenshot of your internet connections?
