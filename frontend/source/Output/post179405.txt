Without Match, how do I remove songs from the cloud? <body> My daughter downloaded a lot of pop music through my iTunes account which re downloads to my iPad and iPhone every time I sync them. How do I delete this music from the cloud. I do not use Match  <answer179425> You can have her delete it / stop it being stored in the cloud (see this help page: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201323 ) - basically just click 'Also delete this song from iCloud'.  Alternatively keep them in iCloud but just turn off Automatic Downloads as suggested above by GeF.  EDIT: Remember, choosing to 'Also delete this song from iCloud' doesn't mean the purchase is wasted - you can always re-download previously purchased tracks.  <comment212626> Are talking about purchased songs ? <comment212627> Yes. She purchased them using my account <comment212628> I expressed this inaccurately. The song titles download to my music lists and she purchased such a lot that it makes it difficult to browse <comment212633> I don't believe there is such an option. However, you can stop them from downloading to your iOS devices by going to System Settings - iTunes & App Store and turning "iTunes" off under the section "Automatic Downloads"
