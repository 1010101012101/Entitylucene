Connection to Shared Diskstations <body> I have two Synology Diskstations. One of them (diskstation-8) is always connected to my mac pro. For some reason the other one (diskstation-5) is not and I need always to click on it when I want the disk station connected. I have recently transfered to El Capitan. I would like to have my disk station-5 connected at login and stay connected (like my diskstation-8 ... but I don't remember how I fixed that)   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZBUGH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer227594> I dropped an AppleScript into my Login Items.  precodetell application "Finder"     try         -- open location ("afp://DiskStation.local/Archive")         -- open location ("afp://DiskStation.local/Documents")         -- open location ("afp://DiskStation.local/Media")         mount volume "afp://DiskStation.local/Archive"         mount volume "afp://DiskStation.local/Documents"         mount volume "afp://DiskStation.local/Media"         mount volume "afp://DiskStation.local/Pictures"         on error number n           display alert ("Error " &amp; n &amp; " on network share mount")     end try end tell /code/pre
