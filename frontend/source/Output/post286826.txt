Enable watchOS's "Auto Unlock" feature with FileVault enabled on macOS? <body> I've recently hit a pretty nasty problem when trying to enable Auto Unlock on my Mid-2014 MacBook Pro. For reference, I'm currently running macOS Sierra version 10.12.5, iOS 10.3.2, and watchOS 3.2.2. I know Auto Unlock is supported, as it says to in System Information.app under Wi-Fi.  The issues seems to be with FileVault. With FileVault enabled, the Automatic Login setting cannot be changed to yes (found in System Preferences under Users &amp; Groups, Login Options) as FileVault is enabled. I've followed the steps provided by Apple to enable Auto Unlock on both my watch and laptop, which are found here. Weird thing is, I have a friend who has found a way to enable strongboth/strong FileVault and Auto Unlock. Apparently he used some terminal commands, but can't remember what he used.  After doing some research into the matter, I found the login preference codeDisableFDEAutoLogin/code and have set it to false via bash. Yet even with this set to codeNO/code, the ability to enable Automatic Login is still prevented.  Does anyone have any workarounds for this?
