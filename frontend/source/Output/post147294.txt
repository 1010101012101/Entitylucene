conflict between google and yahoo contacts on my iphone 5 <body> Unfortunately, when I purchased my iphone 5 (the first iphone I have owned) I made a serious mistake.  I linked both my Yahoo contacts and my Google contacts to the phone.  They conflict with each other and, because of this, icloud will not back up all my contacts.br I do not care whether Yahoo contacts are linked or whether Goggle is linked, but I do not want both because of the conflict problems. How I unlink either Yahoo or Google without losing all my contacts?  <comment173678> regardless what you do your contacts are safe on yahoo and google, so you can always get them again. So what have you tried so far.
