How to get Java SE 6 runtime when Apple website isn't working? <body> I just did a clean install of Yosemite on my Macbook Pro (early 2009). I am re-installing some Adobe programs like DreamWeaver but it needs the legacy Java SE 6 runtime.   Everything online says to check the link I posted below, but it no longer works (too many redirects). I've downloaded Java 8, but it still prompts me to download SE 6.   Idk if it's just me, but I've tried clearing the "website data" from Safari, opening it in different browsers, and even trying to open the page on a Linux machine and my iPhone. Does anyone else know where else I can go to download Java SE 6?  https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US  <answer181558> I've installed Apple Java 2014-001 and it worked.  <answer181559> Here is a direct link to download Java For OSX 2014-001  <answer181566> strongUpdate:/strongbr Original KB link appears to be working again.br Would appear to have been an Apple issue, now resolved.  <answer181567> The link that pops up when you try to open an Adobe app doesn't work (it tries to open an older version of the website I believe). It happened to me. Just follow this link https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US to be able to download it  <comment215929> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this seems to be a temporary issue with a website - and is no use to future readers <comment215930> This does not provide an answer to the question.
