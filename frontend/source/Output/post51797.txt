Mac spontaneously restarts <body> I'm running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. I leave my machine for an hour. When I return the machine is asleep and all the applications have been shut down. It is almost as if it has spontaneously restarted.   Any ideas what could be causing this?  <answer51799> If you are running Lion, you may be seeing the effects of Lion's auto kill feature. This feature automatically quits any applications that are open if they haven't been used in awhile. Try disabling it as such by typing this in Terminal:  precodedefaults write -g NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool yes /code/pre  To turn it back on:  precodedefaults write -g NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool no /code/pre  supFrom this answer./sup  <answer51821> I'm not sure what is causing it, but it sounds like a hardware issue, or that the power outlet the machine is plugged into may be faulty.   You can try going to the strongEnergy Saver/strong preference pane and unchecking emStart up automatically after a power failure/em. If the computer really is shutting down and restarting this may help you find out.  If it emis/em shutting down, it may be:  ul liFaulty power supply/li liFaulty power outlet or another electronic device complicating power in that outlet/li liOverheating/li /ul  <comment59209> Could this be on Snow Leopard too? <comment59210> @EricBrotto No. Snow Leopard did not have auto kill. <comment62099> I don't see this option on Snow Leopard.
