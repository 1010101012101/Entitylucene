Calendar Notifications Don't Stop <body> The OS X calendar does not stop nagging me about birthdays in the next two days. No matter if I click Close or Snooze, it just goes on showing it to me every few minutes. It's driving me mad. I don't want them to be disabled entirely, but this is so insane... Besides, those notifications even overlay movies I watch. I'm so tired of it. If it was a friend of mine, I'd quit the friendship and brake his nose.  What can I do to make me feel good again?  blockquote class="spoiler"    Sorry for my writing, but this is driving me nuts.   <comment216907> Sure they're only in a single calendar? Over the years, I had managed to generate 3 different damn birthday lists, my iCloud, a shared one, one on Google over CalDAV…. I was a mess ;-) <comment217143> Yessir. They are. <comment217144> ah, OK - was worth checking. Sorry, then I'm not sure where to start - wish you luck though :) [snooze will always nag, though… I'm not sure why close would]
