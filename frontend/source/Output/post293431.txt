How can I change a Numbers graph x axis to go from the lowest value to the highest value? <body> I'm graphing columns A and B, where A is the x axis. I have entries entered in A like so: code1, 3, 2, 4, 5/code... and so on.  When I select A and B and make a graph, it seems like the x axis does not automatically arrange itself from the lowest to the greatest value, meaning the graph looks quite strange.   Is there a way to make the x axis graph the data as code1, 2, 3, 4, 5/code... instead of as code1, 3, 2, 4, 5/code...?  Sorry if I am unclear. I will make amendments at the earliest opportunity if clarification is required.  <answer293436> Sort your data ascending based on the values in column A - the x-axis.  <comment370244> Sorry, I forgot to mention I don't want to sort the column. If your method is the only way, however, I'll mark it as the answer. <comment370246> Does it matter if the graph uses a sorted data set? Because if not, then just make a copy of the dataset using large() or small() and have the points in order only for the graph. <comment370247> Right, I could do that. I'm just surprised there's no way to have it the other way. In Excel it sorts the x values automatically <comment370248> I found that excel didn't sort automatically (may be down to chart type) which is why I came up with the second dataset with large trick - I wanted to add a datapoint into the array which showed the optimum solution and it had to be in order... <comment370249> I see. Seems like you'd be the person to ask, then <comment370250> There are many better than I on the excel stack...
