Command-Control-Arrow beeps (plays alert sound) in Lion <body> I've noticed since upgrading to Lion that if I press kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdLeft/Right/kbd (and sometimes kbdDown/kbd as well; see below), my computer beeps at me (plays alert sound).  It doesn't occur in all applications:  ul liIn Console, I can press any of the above key combinations, and there's no beep./li liIn Mail, it beeps if I press kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdLeft/Right/kbd, but not kbdUp/Down/kbd./li liIn most every other application, every combination except kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdUp/kbd causes a beep./li /ul  I can't seem to find any menu commands that it might be trying to invoke, although even if that were the case, applications such as NetBeans and PhpStorm are the proverbial monkey wrench here:  I have kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdLeft/kbd mapped to "go to last edit".  When I press that key combination, my Mac still beeps at me, but it it also does move the cursor to the last edit location.  What does kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdLeft/Right/Up/Down/kbd map to that my Mac is complaining about?  <answer24011> The beeping you are hearing in this context is not because those key commands are mapped to something but quite the contrary because they are not.   strongTyping an unmapped key command will result in an audible bell./strong   As you note kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdRight/kbd in results in an audible bell in Mail.app. You will also note that kbdCommand/kbd-kbdN/kbd results in a new message.  So here's a proof to confirm my assertion:   ul liOpen System Preferences  Keyboard /li liSelect Keyboard Shortcuts from the pillbox at the top/li liFrom the menu at the right choose Application Shortcuts/li liClick the small + sign at the bottom left of the right panel/li liFrom the Application pull down select Mail/li liIn the Menu Title field type "New Message" (no quotes)/li liPlace your cursor in the Keyboard Shortcut field and type kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdRight/kbd/li liClick Add/li /ul  Now return to Mail and type kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdRight/kbd. A new message will be created but if you type kbdCommand/kbd-kbdN/kbd you will hear the audible bell. This is because kbdCommand/kbd-kbdN/kbd is no longer mapped to anything. We replaced it.  So when you hear the audible bell it often means that you are trying to do something that is not possible (i.e. typing a key command that has no meaning for the current application).  <answer260566> I've found a nice workaround.  Create the file code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code with the following content:  precode{     "^@\UF701" = "noop:";     "^@\UF702" = "noop:";     "^@\UF703" = "noop:"; } /code/pre  Found on GitHub/Atom.  <comment26835> Interesting.  That seems to make sense.  Apps like NetBeans and PhpStorm seem to be an exception to this rule, but they do implement their own shortcut handling, so it's possible that they are simply not doing it properly. <comment37315> I ended up working around this issue in NetBeans/PhpStorm by changing the shortcut to `Command`-`Option`-`Left`. <comment40051> I see the same thing with all the JetBrains apps.  It's driving me nuts :( <comment166392> You can also mute like http://superuser.com/questions/98868/how-do-i-disable-the-beep-in-osx-leopard-when-i-perform-an-invalid-action#answer-287085 <comment211629> IntelliJ is precisely why I'm here... <comment349101> i had to switch @ and ^ on ElCapitan "@^\UF701" <comment350750> Thank you both! This actually work!
