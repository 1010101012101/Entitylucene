What is different between itms vs itms-apps when opening url from device <body> I've an app in appstore and when it has an update the link was given in the format codeitms://itunes.com/apps/[AppName]/code Now I've recently uploaded a new version of my app and from the older app when I click the update link it takes us to store but doesnt give option to update. It gives a button saying open, I have to then take the store option again for download then it comes with the update option. So, I changed the link format to codeitms-apps://itunes.com/apps/[AppName]/[AppId]/code and this time when I clicked on the link it opened up correctly giving me option to update. Was this a new update in the format? What was the difference between opening link between these two formats?  <comment352467> Perhaps this link would be interesting: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/433907/how-to-link-to-apps-on-the-app-store To me it looks like there's no difference between itms and itms-apps
