App for changing between a work and private mode <body> I use my Mac for private and work. Between this two scopes I share a lot of configuration. Because of that I want to use only one account.  Here is my question:  Is a app existing with which I can change between a work and private mode? Here some things that the app should do:  ul lienable and disable my work email account/li limount and unmount a list of devices/li listart a specific collection of software/li /ul  <answer198262> I would go for ControlPlane which is location-aware or can change state depending on what devices are plugged in.  You will then need to configure it with a work location and a private or home location.  Things like launching multiple apps would be firstly set up in Automator and saved as a double-clickable script.   For example, I have one that launches Safari and opens a number of websites, then launches iTerm.  You would get ControlPlane to run this script when it detects the stage change.  <comment223520> Sidekick could be of help, [see this other answer here][1].
