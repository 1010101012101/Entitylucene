Keyboard shortcut to show/hide keyboard visualizer? <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut to show/hide the keyboard visualizer?  I usually access it using the input-method icon in the top-right corner then select "show keyboard visualizer" but I don't know how to do it without the mouse  <answer271791> It's not a single-stroke shortcut, but a "non-mousing" solution is kbdFn/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF8/kbd to set focus on the "Status menu" icons on the right side of the menu bar.  (Section 4)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAbRf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Arrows will navigate you to the Keyboard Preferences icon and the Show/Hide options. When you enter kbdFn/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF8/kbd the icon to the furthest left side of the "Status menu" icons which are on the right half of the menu bar will get highlighted. Once it is selected, then use the kbdRight Arrow →/kbd to navigate to the one you want.  Use the kbdDown Arrow ↓/kbd to open the menu and select the option you want. Note that the kbdOption/kbd key will make different menu options available in some of the "status menus".    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmU8S.gif" alt="enter image description here"  Of note, kbdFn/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF2/kbd will activate the Apple menu icon  on the left hand side. From there the kbdRight Arrow →/kbd will give you access to the Application menu. These options are available in System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts::Keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ikQ3d.png" alt="enter image description here"  Depending on how you have your Function keys configured, the kbdFn/kbd is optional.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAlFk.png" alt="enter image description here"  In macOS Sierra you can also use Siri to help with this. Invoke Siri with whichever keyboard shortcut you choose from System Preferences  Siri::Keyboard Shortcut, for example kbdOption/kbd+kbdSpacebar/kbd    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PeJCX.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...then say "Turn on the Keyboard Viewer"    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8QZDA.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...and voila:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bJGWX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Unfortunately, Siri will not close the Keyboard Viewer, nor will kbdCommand⌘/kbd+kbdw/kbd  <comment341633> @Mr.Kennedy - I think that might be a good move. Linking as a dupe to a single canonical answer is generally good & you have a comprehensive 'modern' answer here. It may just take a little while to bubble to the top of the votes.
