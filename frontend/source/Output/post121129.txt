changing camera to thunderbolt display for google hangout <body> I use google hangouts for multiple-people video calls, but it never detects the camera in the Thunderbolt display. It keeps using the camera on my MacBook Pro.  Is there any way to change the camera used in Hangouts if I want to use the Thunderbolt display's camera?  <answer121131>    ol   liClick the strongOptions/strong button at the bottom of your chat list./li   liSelect strongChat settingsâ€¦/strong from the menu./li   liAdjust the selections in the drop-down menus for your camera, microphone, and speakers./li   /ol   supSource: https://support.google.com/chat/answer/162176/sup  hr  [alternative]  strongJune 2015/strong (latest)  Within a particular Hangout, you can know click on the Settings button at the top   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7kUe.png" alt="Settings button"  and change your audio and video settings.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/48wQa.png" alt="Within-Hangout options for audio and video"  This allows you to switch between the laptop's camera and the display's camera.  strongFebruary 2014/strong (possibly outdated)  By clicking on Options in the Hangouts app in Chrome:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YgFnG.png" alt="enter image description here"  the only thing I could see was:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9jTj.png" alt="Hangouts options"  which didn't take me very far.

With the new Hangouts list, I'm still not sure how to go about it since the Chat options seems limited to "Chat on" or "Chat off".]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rv9MH.png" alt="enter image description here"  In any case, both of  Gmail  Chat list  Chat settings and Gmail  Settings  Chat take you to the same place, where you can select which camera to use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wmqy1.png" alt="Gmail chat list &gt; Options &gt; Settings"
