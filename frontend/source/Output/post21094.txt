Lock Screen Screenshots <body> I want to take a screenshot of my Lion lock screen to highlight the new circular user portraits.  Is there an easy way to take a screenshot of the OS X lock screen?  <answer21101> You can do this via the command line if you can ssh into the machine, using the codescreencapture/code command.  Take a look at this question for some more info.  <answer195140> I know this is old but this is a suitable solution for strongLion/strong through to strongYosemite/strong and it's pretty obvious.  The commands is:  precodesleep 5 &amp;&amp; screencapture -t jpg -S ~/Desktop/screenshot.jpg /code/pre  This will take a codescreencapture/code in code5 seconds/code and save it to code~/Desktop/screenshot.jpg/code.  You can quickly jump to the lock screen with codeCtrl+Shift+Power/code or for older macbooks codeCtrl+Shift+Eject/code.  <comment23117> Did you try the default Cmd+Shift+3? I suspect it works, but I am at work and don't have a mac handy <comment23124> The three second delay of Skitch works for me.
