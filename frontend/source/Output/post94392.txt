How to copy all files with extension/filetype in terminal? <body> I want to copy all files in code~/Desktop/code with the extension code.jpeg/code to my flash drive.  How can I do this in the terminal?  <answer94396> Try:  precodefind /source/directory -iname \*.jpeg -exec cp {} /destination/directory/ \; /code/pre  Where code/source/directory/code is would be your code/Users/*username*/Desktop//code directory.  Answer provided from Stack Overflow  <answer94424> precodecp ~/Desktop/*.jpeg /Volumes/flashdrive/ /code/pre  will copy all of the files on the current user's desktop with extension ".jpeg" to the drive named "flashdrive".    If the above command produces an codeArgument list too long/code error, then the safest most efficient way to handle it is to use a codefor/code loop like this:  precodefor f in ~/Desktop/*.jpeg; do cp "$f" /Volumes/flashdrive/; done /code/pre  <comment110742> a simple `cp ~/Desktop/*.jpeg /flashdrive` is slightly less scary for a Terminal newbie... <comment287093> This worked when the other answer gave me an "Argument list too long" error for ~60k files.
