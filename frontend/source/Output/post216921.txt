Why my CodeRunner mac app keep output “(B[m” before my correct output? <body> When I code test ruby script, it keeps output strong"(B[m"/strong before my other output, even thought I just have single line codeputs/code statement.   Just as follow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vvt97.png" alt="enter image description here"  See the strong"(B[m"/strong before my output text "      test". It's really annoying me for a long while. Any help will be preciated!  hr  strongUpdate:/strong  It occurs at CodeRunner version 1.3.1, and in latest version(2.2.1) I also get a "(B" there!  <answer216922> It looks like a language encoding issue.  Check that the space characters at the beginning of the string are actually half-width space, and not Japanese full-width spaces.
