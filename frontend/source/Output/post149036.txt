Disable iOS 8 Safari fullscreen on an iPad <body> I just upgraded my 4th gen iPad to iOS 8 only to discover that Safari has this annoying behavior whereby scrolling down hides the search bar, bookmarks, navigation buttons and tabs. This is highly annoying as now it takes multiple taps to perform what use to be one tap. Example: I scroll down, then want to switch tabs or go to a bookmark. I now have to tap the top of the screen, wait a moment for the animation, then tap the tab or bookmark.  Is there a way to disable this full screen mode feature?
