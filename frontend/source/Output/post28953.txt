Open iTerm2 SSH session in new window instead of new tab <body> Now that I figured out how to set iTerm2 as the ssh:// URL handler, I'd like iTerm2 to respond to an ssh URL by opening a new window instead of opening a new tab in an existing window. Is this possible?  <answer29762> I was curious about the same problem. After reviewing the source code, I found in iTerm2 v1.0.0.20111020 is hard-coded to open a new session as a tab if a session already exists, when it receives nearly any "launch this URL with a handler" command.  My Xcode and Objective-C skills are still rather weak, but if you want to give it a shot I believe the problem is related to the source file strongiTermController.m/strong. On lines 789 to 870 the codelaunchBookmark:withURL/code method has the following code:  precode// Where do we execute this command? BOOL toggle = NO; if (theTerm == nil) {     [iTermController switchToSpaceInBookmark:aDict];     term = [[[PseudoTerminal alloc] initWithSmartLayout:YES                                              windowType:[aDict objectForKey:KEY_WINDOW_TYPE] ? [[aDict objectForKey:KEY_WINDOW_TYPE] intValue] : WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL                                                  screen:[aDict objectForKey:KEY_SCREEN] ? [[aDict objectForKey:KEY_SCREEN] intValue] : -1] autorelease];     [self addInTerminals: term];     toggle = [term windowType] == WINDOW_TYPE_FULL_SCREEN; } else {     term = theTerm; }  id result = [term addNewSession: aDict withURL: url]; /code/pre  I suspect that when codetheTerm == nil/code, codeaddNewSession/code works as expected by launching a new window, since one is currently not running. Perhaps you can modify the code to force the first block to always run, regardless of codetheTerm/code's contents.  I hope this helps!! .. It may be worth filing a bug report or contacting the author if you're still having problems.  <comment33285> You can drag any tab out of an iTerm 2 window to create a new window. <comment34174> Submitted a feature request: http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/issues/detail?id=1567 <comment34203> +1 on Google Code. I would purpose that there be an option to disable tabs entirely, as I personally never use them. However this may be overkill as the only time I've ever encountered a "forced tab" is by this use-case. So if upstream can fix this specific bug I'll be happy too :)
