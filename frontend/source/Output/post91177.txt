cannot run sudo <body> I have a corporate account codework/code on my macbook that has administrator privileges and created a non-administrative account codelocal/code.  Logged in as codelocal/code, when I tried a command with sudo, I got the familiar codeis not in the sudoers file/code.  The file code/etc/sudoers/code is owned by the usual coderoot/wheel/code. I tried to modify the file inside a codesu work/code shell but it was readonly for that user. Then I tried codesu root/code but that didn't work either. Then I found out that I need to enable to the root user.   I enabled the root user, but still cannot codesu root/code, still get the same terse codesu: Sorry/code. I seem to have enabled the root user correctly, since the process to enable it now gives the option to disable it or change password.  How can I get codesu/code to work for user codelocal/code? Is there a another way to allow the user codelocal/code to use codesudo/code?   <answer91179> I found out that the I was able to modify code/etc/sudoers/code when I logged in as codework/code using codessh/code. Not sure if I had made some mistake with my previous attempt with codesu - work/code.  The following steps worked:  ul liLogged in as codelocal/code, start with codessh work@localhost/code/li licodesudo visudo/code/li liAdd entry codelocal   ALL=(ALL) ALL/code/li liSave and exist vi/li liExist ssh session/li liTry codesudo ls //code/li /ul  <comment107085> You do not need to enable root - the normal way is from the admin account `sudo visudo` which opens vi on the sudoers file <comment107086> The issue is you need to be an admin user to edit sudoers and so you have to be logged in as work. <comment107194> Thanks @Mark, that is exactly what I ended up doing. I think I first tried `sudo visudo` inside a `su - ` but it failed and later the samething from a `ssh @localhost` did, I could be wrong but now my non-privileged account is in `sudoers` and I am happy camper.
