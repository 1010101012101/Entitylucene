Weird line wrapping in terminal with a colored prompt <body> I have reason to think I've got improper escaping in my bash prompt (I get weird random line wrapping in Terminal).  Can anyone point it out? It looks OK to me...  precodeexport PS1="\033[0;35m\u\033[00m on \033[0;36m\h\033[00m in \033[0;33m\w\033[00m \$ " /code/pre  <answer88320> Encase your colors in brackets code[]/code so they count as non-printable characters.  precodeexport PS1="\[\033[0;35m\]\u\[\033[00m\] on \[\033[0;36m\]\h\[\033[00m\] in \[\033[0;33m\]\w\[\033[00m\] \$ " /code/pre  Unfortunately, this results in well-known line wrapping issues that is plagued by bash.  There is good news everyone, the light at the end of the tunnel is codetput/code.  precodeecho $(tput setaf 6) This is cyan /code/pre  Set all your variables first, then use it within the script.  precodemg=$(tput setaf 5);cy=$(tput setaf 6);yl=$(tput setaf 3);rs=$(tput sgr0); echo $mg $USER $cy $HOSTNAME $yl $PWD $rs /code/pre  You can find an example script in my github codedotfiles/code repo  <comment103373> Additional resources:  https://github.com/jnovack/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/colorize.sh <comment103580> Thanks very much! That seems to have done the trick.
