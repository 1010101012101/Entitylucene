Copying mail account settings from Mac to iPad? <body> I'm setting up an iPad, and I'm trying to get my mail account settings from my Mac onto the iPad. Of course, it's possible to do it manually, but this seems like a case where syncing the settings should be simple.  This answer suggests looking into "iCloud Keychain Sync" which should sync the mail settings (the "internet accounts" on the Mac). Unfortunately, I can't seem to get it working. My Keychain is set to be included in iCloud for both my Mac and iPad. Under the iCloud account settings on my Mac, the iPad is listed as a device. I've turned off Keychain on the iPad, deleted all Keychain data, and reconnected, but to no avail. Is there something else I'm missing to get the mail account settings onto my iPad? Or am I making some other mistake? Thanks!  emEdit:/em I'm using macOS Sierra and iOS 10.
