MacBook Pro (13 inch, mid 2009) crashing hard in Safari; can't run Apple hardware testm <body> Several months ago my Mac started crashing. Usually it happens exactly when I click a link in Safari (strongEdit:/strong I tested with Chrome and get the same behavior). I click a link, the page starts to load, then the whole computer hard locks. No beach ball, the cursor does not move, the keyboard is completely unresponsive. After two or three minutes, the screen goes black and it reboots.  I tried creating a new user account and running under that for a while. The whole computer became super responsive. But it didn't solve the issue. I'm able to go for days without crashing while programming, I can do a whole super duper clone of the hard drive without crashing, but bringing Safari into the mix brings the crashes back.   I should point out that it does occasionally crash spontaneously, but usually Safari is running in the background.  I'm running Mavericks because I wanted to rule out a hardware issue before upgrading to Yosemite. (Mostly the Mac has been on a shelf for the past few months because the crashes went from once a week to about once a day and I feared a hard drive issue.)  I've tried:   ul liCreating a new user and running under that user, as I mentioned above./li liResetting Safari./li liCreating a super duper clone, booting off the clone, and running disk utility, to rule out HFS+ corruption. That came back totally clean, both times I tried it./li liI also have tried using Apple Hardware Test. Because I did a fresh install of mountain lion onto this SSD, I discovered that didn't work. The hardware is too old to support running AHT over the Internet (that doesn't work either) So I downloaded AHT from https://github.com/upekkha/AppleHardwareTest/blob/master/Readme.markdown and installed it to my boot drive, according to the instructions, but it still does not load Apple Hardware Test./li /ul  My questions:  ul liWhat the heck is the underlying problem?/li liShould I install Yosemite and hope for the best? Upgrade or fresh install?/li liHow can I get AHT to run?/li liI started out thinking this was a disk issue. Is there anything I can do to rule that out? I could replace my wonderful SSD with a (gulp) 5400rpm laptop drive and try that for a while I suppose./li liHow is Safari completely hard locking my computer?/li /ul  I'm looking for next steps and/or advice. Thank you!

I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. <comment227537> I was able to crash it the exact same way with Chrome. After about fifteen minutes of moderate web browsing, I typed a search in the chrome address bar, hit enter, and a moment later it just completely locked up. <comment227545> OK, so it is not a browser. Now we need you to provide copy of your console log at the time of the event. 50-100 lines
