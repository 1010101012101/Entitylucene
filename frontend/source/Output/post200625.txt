Xcode 6.4 does not start on OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite <body> As of this morning, Xcode 6.4 stopped launching on my Mac running OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite.  I tried to launch with  precodesudo open --new /Applications/Xcode.app /code/pre  but got  precodeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/Xcode.app /code/pre  I've reinstalled Xcode, but get the same result. I've tried Disk Utility and antivirus software and my system seems to be clean.   Any ideas how I should proceed, short of reinstalling OS X?  <answer200637> Make a new user account (admin role) and log out.  If you can start Xcode from Launchpad or Finder in the new account - it's a user level issue. If not, then start with system issues like restart / reinstall latest combo updater or safe boot.  <answer200662> Turns out that Xcode.app had an extended attribute com.apple.quarantine which blocked the app from starting.  After having removed it with xattr -c /Applications/Xcode.app Xcode is working again.
