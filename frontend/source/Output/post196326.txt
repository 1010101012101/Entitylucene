How to change a directory name? <body> My home directory was not where it was supposed to be. I was able to fix the directory location. Then needed to fix the permission of home directory with   precode$ cd /Users/ $ sudo chown -R hook1:staff /Users/hook1 chown: /Users/hook1: no file or directory $ ls -F Shared/    chris/      hook1???/ /code/pre  Home directory incorrectly appears as codehook1???//code not codehook1//code Is there a reason for this?   <answer196404> If what you posted was literally what the directory name is, then this should work:  precodecd /Users mv hook1\?\?\? hook1 /code/pre  The problem, as fd0 points out, is that you have invisible/unprintable characters in your directory name. Use basic, non-destructive shell commands to isolate the directory name using wildcards, then rename it.  For example, try this:  precodecd /Users ls -ld h* /code/pre  That should result in exactly one directory being listed. If it does not, continue to add letters before the code*/code in order to create a wildcard mask that produces exactly one result:  precodels -ld ho*     # produces 3 results ls -ld hoo*    # produces 1 result /code/pre  If you get to a point where you go from more than one result to zero results, then you've stumbled upon another invisible character. Back up one letter, add a question mark then re-add the letter.  precodels -ld ho*     # produces 3 results ls -ld hoo*    # produces 0 results ls -ld ho?o*   # produces 1 result /code/pre  If you still have problems, play around with more code*/code and code?/code until you have something that produces exactly one result:  precodels -ld ho*     # produces 3 results ls -ld hoo*    # produces 0 results ls -ld ho?o*   # produces 0 results ls -ld ho*o*   # produces 1 result /code/pre  Once you have that, then use that in your codemv/code command:  precodemv ho*o* hook1 /code/pre  If none of this works, please post the results of you codels -ld/code experiments.  <comment234499> You need to be more specific about what your issue is... what incorrectly appears?  Can you tell us more specifically what was wrong that you were trying to fix, how you were trying to fix and specifics of what you  are seeing now that is wrong? <comment234500> @Tyson I changed it. When I want to show a command sequence in the question, what do use around it <comment234502> It looks like you have non-printable characters in your user name. Will you edit your post with the command and ouput of `id ; id -un`. <comment234632> `mv hook\?\?\? hook1`    didn't work. Should your second set of commands be   `cd /Users`  `mv hook1* hook1`  I believe you are missing the 1. <comment234633> Is my comment format in correct form? Please advise, still new <comment234663> Your comment was fine. I originally had `mv h* hook1`, but I didn't know if you have more directories than you showed in your example. Basically, as fd0 points out, you have invisible/unprintable characters in your directory name. I'll update my answer with more details. <comment234665> I tried to fix your copy from Terminal (including the parts you've left out), please check and correct if necessary. <comment234689> I think this has something to do with.          `The-Glass-Hook:/ chris1$ ls -ld hoo* drwxr-xr-x+ 15 hook1  staff  510 Jul 15 22:25 hook1???` `The-Glass-Hook:/ chris1$ cd /Users` `The-Glass-Hook:Users chris1$ ls -ld hoo*` `drwxr-xr-x  15 hook1  admin  510 Jul 18 08:20 hook1???` <comment234691> `The-Glass-Hook:/ chris1$ ls -F` `Applications/`           `etc@` `Incompatible Software/`  `home/` `Library/`                   `hook1???/` `Network/`           `installer.failurerequests` `System/`            `net/` `User Information@`          `private/` `Users/`            `sbin/` `Volumes/`           `tmp@` `bin/`                    `usr/` `cores/`             `var@` `dev/` <comment234973> So does `mv hoo* hook1` not work? <comment236318> @Chris: please upgrade your OQ with `ls -aBl` (in `/Users`) which is another way to find which characters are at the end of your account name.
