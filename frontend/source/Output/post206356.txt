possible to run Dell monitors as a single monitor with a MBA 2013 <body> I do software development and would like to run two Dell U2414H's in portrait mode as a single screen. Is this possible with a MBA 2013? Like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eWLkt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer206364> The MacBook Air will require a Dual-link DVI output using Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter to connect to the two monitors (so the monitors need DVI cables/connectors) and as long as the strongcombined/strong resolution of the displays is no more than 2500 x 1600 then it will work as that is the max resolution of an external display with this Mac.   If the combined Max resolution of these displays is higher than 2500 x 1600 it may well support both but you won't get the maximum resolution out of the displays.  <comment248761> that sounds like an ugly and expensive solution ..... ugh... <comment248768> would a modern mac mini be able to achieve this better? <comment248837> if you go to Apple support they have the specifications for **all** Macs. That is where I got the info for the MacBook Air. <comment248945> thx - so just so I understand the dual-link dvi is between the two monitors not the between computer and monitor, right? <comment248946> also, do you have any experience with the Matrox DualHeadToGo? <comment249119> I **believe** that that adapter/cable is so you can use two monitors on one thunderbolt port. Verify that before buying anything. No experience with that Matrox device.
