Unable to read HFS+ external USB drive on Windows 10 using HFS explorer (drive previously had encrypted .dmg file) <body> Looking for some help. I have a 1TB external USB drive that is formatted using HFS+. I want my Windows 10 laptop to read it, but it won't show up in HFS explorer, or Disk Management.   After some googling I found out that if the drive is encrypted, then it won't be readable in Windows. I remembered that there was an encrypted dmg file on the drive, which I subsequently deleted. But unfortunately the drive is still not showing up. I think that the encryption may still be hanging around somehow?  Any ideas welcome!  <comment335312> I doubt the encrypted .dmg had anything to do with it - until you try to decrypt it, it's just a file. If the drive doesn't show even in Disk Management, it's not registering to the machine at all. How did you manage to delete the .dmg if the drive won't mount or even show?? <comment335313> Encryption doesn't "hang around;" it's like pregnancy - it either is or isn't.  If the drive is encrypted, there isn't anything you can do until you decrypt it.  That said,  I am not sure what an encrypted .dmg has to do with a drive that's encrypted. <comment335358> I plugged the drive into a Mac to delete the .dmg file. I managed to fix the problem. I repaired the drive using Disk Utility on the Mac, and when I plugged it back into the Windows laptop, it detected it :-)
