How can I add a font to the Font Book Web Collection <body> I'd like to add Courier New to my Font Book "Web" Collection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PaF2Q.png" alt="Web Collection"  I go to the "All Fonts" Collection and search "Courier New":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G0h83.png" alt="All Fonts Collection"  After dragging Courier New into the "Web" Collection nothing happens:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PaF2Q.png" alt="Web Collection"  How can I add Courier New to the "Web" Collection? I'm running OS X 10.9.4.  <answer145501> Deleting the "Web" Collection, creating a new "Web" Collection and dragging in the required fonts from the "All Fonts" Collection solved the issue for me.
