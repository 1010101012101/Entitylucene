How do I remove icon from the launchpad if I already moved app to trash <body> So, I had an app, and removed it (moved to trash)  Now, I can see its icon in launchpad (when I click it says "You can't open the application "Name" because it is in the trash.). With only button OK.  How do I remove it from Launchpad completely?  <answer181322> I restored it from trash and removed again and icon disappeared  <answer181323> Emptying the trash would have worked as well.  Launchpad shoes all apps it finds via spotlight, not just those who are in the Applications folder.   <comment215618> Several possible solutions in this thread: http://superuser.com/questions/372736/uninstalled-program-icon-stuck-on-launchpad-in-mac-os-x-lion <comment215624> If you found a solution to your problem, consider marking it as correct, even if the answer is yours. <comment215628> @zerohedge, sure but it's impossible to mark own solution in 2 days
