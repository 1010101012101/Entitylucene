My command line says `complete:13: command not found: compdef ` <body> When I use a terminal like iTerm or Hyper, right as I boot it up, the first message I get is:  precodecomplete:13: command not found: compdef /code/pre  I don't know what this is from, and how to get rid of it. This message does not show up on the default terminal app though.  I am using bash, and there appear to be no differences in settings for the different terminals.  <comment374435> Can we assume your $SHELL is `bash`? <comment374456> check your ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile
