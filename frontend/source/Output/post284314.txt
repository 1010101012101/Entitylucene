Cannot Sign In to enable iTunes & App Store within iOS Simulator <body> In iPhone SE Simulator (iSO 10.3, running directly), I'm going to emSettings/em, emApple ID/iCloud/em and trying to enable emiTunes &amp; App Store/em which is Off (I was manage already to log in to Apple ID).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNeRkm.png" alt="iPhone SE Simulator, Apple ID"  When enabling, I've got the confirmation message to emSet up iTunes and App Store/em. After Continue I'm asked for the password.  When typed password and emSign In/em, I've got the following error:     Could Not Sign In      There was a problem connecting to the server.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eaKwTm.png" alt="iPhone SE Simulator, Apple ID, Could Not Sign In, There was a problem connecting to the server"  Why this happens and how to fix that? Or it isn't possible to use App Store within iOS Simulator?  hr  I've internet access inside Simulator and date/time is set correctly.  When checked the HTTPS traffic via codetcpdump/code, it is happening both ways to codehttps://17.248.144.170//code.  <answer295632> In-app purchases would be the only reason you need to sign into iTunes/App Store since you cannot download apps from the App Store in the simulator.
