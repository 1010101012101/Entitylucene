How do I boot into Internet Recovery on a iMac? <body> i have this problem i tap on COMMAND+OPTION+R and I want to boot into Internet Recovery on a iMac and for some reason it just continues the screen and boots onto OS X Utilities. Someone help me?  <answer117116> Make sure you're holding the keys for the entire duration of the boot until the spinning globe icon. 'Tapping' the keys isn't enough — you'll need to hold them for a bit (longer than the normal Recovery HD).  <answer117118> Taken from this support article:     OS X Recovery includes a built in set of utilities as part of the   Recovery System. To start your computer from Recovery, restart your   Mac and hold down the strongCommand key/strong and the strongR key/strong (Command-R).   Press and hold these keys until the Apple logo appears.   The recovery feature is limited to OS X Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, and El Capitan.  <comment136887> How old is the iMac ? <comment136898> The iMac i think i bought was in december or november 2013. It's new, anyways @Kristof, thanks it helped a lot. <comment136963> This is the normal Recovery HD — not Internet Recovery… <comment136970> @grgarside have a look at [this](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) article. It states that Internet Recovery will happen automatically if normal recovery is unavailable. Thus, the key combination CMD+R is still valid. <comment136978> Yes, but if the Recovery HD is intact (as demonstrated by the ability to open OS X Utilities) then this won't begin the Internet Recovery process.
