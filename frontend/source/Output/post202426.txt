FCPX thinks my iPhone footage is 24p <body> I was working on a project in FCPX shot with my iPhone 5c and I was about to export it when I noticed a strange export setting. At the bottom of the export window (Where it lists the framerate, resolution, compression, etc.) it said 24p. Upon further investigation I found that the footage I shot was in fact 24p (I used the FCPX inspector under the info tab). Isn't the iPhone supposed to shoot 30p only? I also opened the original video files in Quicktime and used the inspector in there and found some more weird anomalies. It said the footage was 25.5fps. What's going on?
