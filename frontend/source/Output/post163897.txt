External Monitor's USB ports don't work <body> I have connected an external monitor to my macbook pro through a thunderbolt vga adapter. The monitor has several USB ports on it and if I plug a mouse or keyboard into them, they will not work. Is there a fix for this?  <answer163901> You'll need to connect a USB cable (probably A/B) from the monitor to your laptop.  <answer163923> Before assuming that their is a problem with your device.  Some P.C's Require a manaul download of a driver. Which can be found Apple web sight.Original cable for your device is a must. If you have a cable for a camera device with the apple plug should be saficient. Sometimes additional driver to communicate with manufactures is also required for image or file output. Off brand cables are no good.  <comment192022> Yep, this is it. VGA can't transfer USB signals, and monitors with VGA, HDMI, DisplayPort or DVI require a separate USB cable to act as a USB hub.  A Thunderbolt monitor can offer USB ports without an extra cable.
