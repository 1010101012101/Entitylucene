Copying Xcode.app to another location causes system lockup <body> Whenever I try to copy or compress codeXcode.app/code on a computer (downloaded from the Mac App Store, currently version 6.1), the system completely locks up, just allowing me to restart with kbdCtrl+Cmd+Power/kbd.  It does not even matter where I try to copy it, to an external disk, to the internal disk, whatever.  codeConsole.app/code does not show anything suspicious at the time of lockup.  However, when I try codefind /Applications/Xcode.app -type f -exec md5 {} \;/code, everything runs through and exits cleanly.  What the heck is going on ?br Is this some weird kind of copy protection from Apple ?br Do I have to fear some malware hiding ?br Anyone else having a similar issue ?  I have disabled any anti-virus software but the problem persists, even after I upgraded from Xcode 6.0 to 6.0.1 to 6.1, which curiously emdid not/em raise any problems.
