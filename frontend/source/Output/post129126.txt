Application installer does not respond when clicked? <body> I am trying to install an application from its .iso image file. I can successfully mount the .iso file, but when I click the installer, nothing pops up.  I am installing a relatively old version of a software. My guess is that my Mac OS version is too new to run the installer.  How does one usually fix this?  <answer129151> In system preferences  security  change the download from to anywhere.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pp9T1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment151173> Isn't there usually a dialogue box that appears if the app isn't allowed? <comment151194> @dwightk Yes, the window popped up and I did have clicked *Yes, trust.*
