Is there a way to disable/hide the new Photos App in Yosemite? <body> I prefer iPhoto over the new Photos app in Yosemite. It also annoys me, because every time I connect a new device to my Mac, I have to disable "Open Photos App when connected to this device" for that device. It also uses a spot from in my Launchpad.  strongIs there any way to disable/hide the new Photos App in Yosemite from the launchpad and disable it from starting up if any new device connects?/strong I don't want to delete it.  <answer238201> You can try running this command from strongTerminal/strong:br/ codedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug -bool YES/code  To re-enable it again, type:br/ codedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug -bool NO/code  Just a warning that I don't have access to a strongYosemite/strong machine to verify this.  <answer238204> I think you can use Image Capture to disable lanching app when connecting a device (just connect your device, lanch Image Capture and choose your configuration in the folder at the right buttom of the windows).  <comment229179> possible duplicate of [Photos back to iPhoto?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/181866/photos-back-to-iphoto) <comment229242> No, my question is about removing it, not about getting the photos back from the Photos App to iPhoto. <comment292069> What does this exactly do? <comment292076> Disables Photos from launching when a device that captures images, like an iPhone, is connected.
