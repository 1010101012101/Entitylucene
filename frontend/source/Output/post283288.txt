owncloud client update stuck/not progressing <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HVAGv.png" alt="enter image description here"  As shown above, it just stays there "installing update..."  Is it okay for me to kill it?  MacOS Sierra, McBP Mid-2012  <comment357137> I can't say *what* would happen to the application if you kill it while in the process of an update, but as it stands, you really have nothing to lose by killing it.  You may have to re-install <comment357138> its installer popped up after 20 minutes, not sure what happened there.
