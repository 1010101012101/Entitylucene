How to delete the untethered recording or the monitor logs? <body> Last week, I sent my iPhone 6 to a mobile store to replace a new battery.  After that, the system always popped up the warnings say "Out of storage." Then no matter anything I removed like apps, photos, some movie files, the out of space warning keeps popped up. In the space management in codeSetting/code, I can see  the available space continuously decreased.  Finally, I noticed there is a codedeveloper/code option appears in Settings. After I switched off the codeInstruments &gt; Untethered Recording &gt; Energy/code, the magical space decreasing issue is gone.  But there is still about 27GB space occupied labeled as "Others" showing in iTunes. I believed the "energy monitoring log" takes huge space.   Is anyway to remove it and take my space back?  Thanks  P.S. I've tried some advice on internet to clean the logs, like "Logs will be deleted after sync". But it does not work.
