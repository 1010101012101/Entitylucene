What are the best WBS and Gantt chart tool working cross platform? <body> I am searching for the good tools for creating Work Breakdown Structure and Gantt Chart that work cross platform because other people in my team use codeWindow/code. So, this forces me to find cross platform tools.  What have found so far are :   OpenProj : I have used it. The behavior is so quirky that why I gave up.  GanttProject : Cool tool! It can be used to create Gantt along with PERT chart. However, it cannot generate WBS chart.  I have searched a lot and I didn't find the one that I love.   Could you please share your great tools that you are using along with advantages and disadvantages?   <answer120418> http://teamgantt.com â€¦ used by Oracle, Twitter, Sony. You will have to call whether their features are close enough to a WBS to be acceptable. Allows for CSV file import (a file format exported by MS Project).
