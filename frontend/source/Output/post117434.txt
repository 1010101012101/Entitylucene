Press and hold for accents does not work everytime <body> I am a German User, but i am using a US Keyboard and the US Extended Keyboard Layout. Sometimes I need to use German Umlauts, and I usually rely on the "press and hold for accented characters" feature of OS X.  However, this is not always available. I cant seem to find a pattern in this behavior. Sometimes I log in, and it works flawlessly, sometimes it doesn't work at all and just repeats the character I press for a long time.   I switched to different keyboard layouts (US, US Extended, US International PC) and different "Preferred Languages" in the "Language and Region" settings.   I also tried the codedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true/code setting, but also no luck.   I have the same problem on different Macs; at work and at home.  How do I configure this feature correctly?  <answer117794> When it stops working, does codeps -ef|grep PressAndHold/code include a line for code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/MacOS/PressAndHold/code? If it doesn't, try to run codeopen -a PressAndHold/code. Or if it does, codekillall PressAndHold;open -a PressAndHold/code might also be worth a shot.  You could also try to delete code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code. Normally codedefaults read com.apple.HIToolbox/code should show codecom.apple.PressAndHold/code under codeAppleEnabledInputSources/code and codeAppleSelectedInputSources/code.  <answer122864> The option/alt + key combinations should be more reliable once you learn them. For example codealt + s/code types ß and codealt + u/code followed by a vowel types the umlauted vowel äëïöü.   P.S. Thanks for pointing out the press and hold technique that's pretty interesting.   <answer123513> A few things:  I'm on OS 10.9.2 and press and hold is not working for me at the moment.  If I type:  precodedefaults read -g /code/pre  I get:  precode{ AppleAntiAliasingThreshold = 4; AppleAquaColorVariant = 6; AppleEnableMenuBarTransparency = 0; AppleLanguages =     (     en,     fi,     fr,     de,     "zh-Hans",     "zh-Hant",     ja,     es,     it,     nl,     ko,     pt,     "pt-PT",     da,     nb,     sv,     ru,     pl,     tr,     ar,     th,     cs,     hu,     ca,     hr,     el,     he,     ro,     sk,     uk,     id,     ms,     vi ); AppleLocale = "en_GB"; AppleMiniaturizeOnDoubleClick = 0; AppleUserLanguages = 1; InitialKeyRepeat = 68; KeyRepeat = 6; NSAutomaticDashSubstitutionEnabled = 1; NSAutomaticQuoteSubstitutionEnabled = 1; NSAutomaticSpellingCorrectionEnabled = 1; NSNavPanelFileLastListModeForOpenModeKey = 1; NSNavPanelFileLastListModeForSaveModeKey = 1; NSNavPanelFileListModeForOpenMode2 = 1; NSNavPanelFileListModeForSaveMode2 = 1; NSNavPanelSidebarKeyForOpen =     ( ); NSNavPanelSidebarKeyForSave =     ( ); NSNavRecentPlaces =     (     "~/Fede/Work/Parkinson/EPIC4PD/H2020",     "~/Desktop/Archival",     "~/Fede/Work/QTL/Rana-temporaria/Fede-new",     "~/Fede/Cloud",     "~/Fede/Cloud/OneDrive" ); NSPreferredWebServices =     {     NSWebServicesProviderWebSearch =         {         NSDefaultDisplayName = Google;         NSProviderIdentifier = "com.google.www";     }; }; NSTableViewDefaultSizeMode = 1; NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems =     ( ); NavPanelFileListModeForOpenMode = 1; NavPanelFileListModeForSaveMode = 1; WebAutomaticSpellingCorrectionEnabled = 1; "com.apple.keyboard.fnState" = 1; "com.apple.springing.delay" = "0.5"; "com.apple.springing.enabled" = 1; /code/pre  }  i.e I am not getting codeApplePressAndHoldEnabled/code in the first place.  in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code I have the correct instances of codecom.apple.PressAndHold/code, but I noticed a file code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code which does not have codecom.apple.PressAndHold/code.  One guess is that if codecom.apple.PressAndHold/code were to be added there press and hold might work...   <answer213654> For me, it didn't work until I restart the application, which was Pages, in my case.   <answer228684> This worked for me. The press and hold had stopped working in all programs. I followed the instructions below and it worked again  A way to make sure it is enabled is: open Terminal, from Applications, Utilities, then in the Terminal window type, exactly,  precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true /code/pre  press Enter and finally quit Terminal  The key should now do the accents.  <comment137227> Does the behaviour change between restarts when using the same application? Does it always work in TextEdit? <comment137242> No, even restarting of apps does not help. Once this feature fails, it fails for all the apps, even TextEdit and my browsers. <comment137517> While this is not a solution to your problem, it might be a reasonable workaround.  In the US Extended layout, you can also get umlauts with pressing option-u before the vowel, as well as other accents via option-a, option-e.  A possibly complete list is here: http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemacext.html <comment143772> Do you always have another keyboard layout like German, French, or Spanish on your active list?  I have seen reports in another forum that adding this helped some users with similar problems. <comment144209> I can report that the problem of press and hold giving accented alternatives/not doing so at random is present for me, on OS 10.9.2 (installed on a newly formatted disk). <comment225011> Stopped working randomly, `PressAndHold` was present in my `ps` listing, had to `killall PressAndHold;open -a PressAndHold` to get it back. Thanks! <comment293757> This worked for me in addition to the `open -a PressAndHold` command.  Not sure why it had been voted down. <comment364214> sad to say it did not work for me. sigh. Why has this happened, why o why?
