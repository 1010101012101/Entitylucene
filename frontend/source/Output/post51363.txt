Open PDF in full screen from the command line <body> I've written a simple-minded "take a break" reminder which just opens a PDF notice.

Perhaps some codeosascript/code magic?  precode#!/bin/sh B=$HOME/Documents/break.pdf D=3000 while true do         sleep $D         open $B done /code/pre  <answer51364> I've found a way.
