iMac (27" Late 2009) Processor 3.06 GHz Intel core 2 Duo Memory 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 <body> I recently upgraded to Sierra 10.12. I suddenly noticed little "pop-up" messages/commands on my desktop. They suddenly appear and poof, they disappear. Usually too fast for me to read. Messages such as "Press Return", "Copy", etc.  What are they and where did they come from? I don't think I noticed them before I activated Siri. I have since turned off Siri, but I still get them. Can someone explain what they are and how to enable/disable them?  <comment321462> Welcome to Ask Different!  It's helpful if your title is relevant to the question you are asking.
