OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite, has the default PATH changed? <body> Today I had to configure a new macbook, running code10.10.3/code out of the box and immediately upgraded to code10.10.4/code.  After installing codehomebrew/code I went to configure the default codePATH/code, and opened code/etc/paths/code.  I found that it contained:  precode/usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /code/pre  that is, code/usr/local/bin/code is at the top. This is not what I was expecting, and what I know should be the default.  Has the default changed? I reviewed the Homebrew installation script, and it doesn't seem to change code/etc/paths/code. I also codestat/code'ed the file, and it doesn't seem to have been changed.  So, is this the new default PATH order in OS X?  <answer195386> My code/etc/paths/code has the same content on 10.10.4 and has a timestamp of "Sep  9  2014" so it has been like that for quite some time now.  Basically it makes sense to place code/usr/local/bin/code on top because that way binaries installed locally take precedence over the standard versions.  <comment233250> Thank you, the timestamp on that new macbook is the same as yours. Yes, I know it makes sense, but the old default was to have `/usr/local/bin` at the bottom of the list, and in fact I'm used to manually modify `/etc/paths` on new macs for this reason.
