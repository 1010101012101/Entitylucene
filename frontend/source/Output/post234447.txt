Howto clean Photo Folder <body> I opened Photo. I deleted all the pictures. Then I emptied the "Deleted images".  My Photo app is apparently empty.  I open finder, the photo library package is around 7GB an subfolders are full of old images and other unknown files.  I wish to clean all, to gain a fresh empty Library.  If I delete the .photoslibrary folder, the app shows an error message.   Can someone tell me the right procedure, please?  <answer234458> You can create a new library by opening iPhoto whilst holding kbd‚å• alt/option/kbd. This creates a fresh iPhoto library which you can import media into.
