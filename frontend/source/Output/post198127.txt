irritating window locations after a closed clam <body> I switch back and forth, frequently, between 'closed clam' with a large monitor and 'just the laptop monitor' with a Retina MBP.  Whenever I switch, all my windows appear in unhelpful locations sticking off the edges of the visible screen. This happens in both directions.   I currently run Yosemite.  Is there a way to make them recenter?  <answer198131> I use an AppleScript tied to a keyboard shortcut that runs as an Automator service. Something like this:  precodetell application "System Events" tell application process "iTunes" -- non running procs fail silently     try         set position of front window to {22, 26} -- or you can call windows by name     end try end tell end tell /code/pre  You'll need two scripts, one for each configuration. Obviously, you'll have to enter all your windows and Apps into the code, so this is only a worthwhile effort for the stuff you commonly use.  <comment237031> Two scripts might be easier/quicker to code however if I needed a script two work in two different hardware configurations I'd code a single script to work under both configurations.  Write once use many! :) <comment237037> @user3439894 :    **do shell script " defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver | grep -w -m 2 Unit"** Then count the how many times "Unit" shows up in the result string, and use that to branch. <comment237061> The bounds `{22, 14}` sets the top of the window under the menu bar. To justify it to the top left of the Desktop, it would be better set to `{0, 22}`. <comment237062> Fixed. {22, 26} will do. Point is you can put it wherever you want. The example also makes for a nice way to recover windows that have somehow gotten entirely off screen, or to hide windows entirely off screen.
