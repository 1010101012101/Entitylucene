Mac Pro: Splitting network traffic based on destination <body> I have a Mac Pro tower with two ethernet ports. One of them is connected to the company intranet and the other to my home network. I'd like my Mac to use the former ethernet connection only for those services within the intranet; for everything else I'd like to use the latter connection (e.g. the web).  Given that the intranet addresses will fall into a specific range, how can this be done?  strongUpdate/strong  Thanks to some huge help from codebmike/code I've been making some progress but am still not quite there yet. Here is my original routing table (with some details omitted) showing the two codedefault/code paths leading out of either Ethernet port:  precodedefault    A.B.C.D    UGSc           17        0     en0 default    E.F.G.H    UGScI          12        0     en1 /code/pre  The first entry is to the company network via Ethernet 1 (codeen0/code); the second to my home network via Ethernet 2 (codeen1/code).  The goal is to force all traffic emnot/em destined for a location within the company to route through Ethernet 2. My understanding thus far has led me to modify the routing tables as such:  precodesudo /sbin/route -n delete default A.B.C.D sudo /sbin/route -n add -net A A.B.C.D /code/pre  Giving me the following modified table:  precodedefault    E.F.G.H     UGScI          1        0     en1 A          A.B.C.D     UGSc          28        0     en0 /code/pre  The end result is not quite what I'd expect, however. I am still able to access all sites on the company intranet however all traffic to e.g., stackoverflow.com or anywhere else emother/em than the intranet fails. A sampling from codeping/code confirms this:  precodeFooBar:~ username$ ping latimes.com PING latimes.com (144.142.224.43): 56 data bytes ping: sendto: No route to host /code/pre  Is the codedefault/code entry above not sufficient for that purpose, or am I missing something?  strongUpdate 2/strong  Apparently adding the following got things working as I'd expect:  precodesudo /sbin/route -n add default E.F.G.H /code/pre  Resulting in the following table:  precodedefault            E.F.G.H     UGSc            0        0     en1 default            E.F.G.H     UGScI          25        0     en1 A                  A.B.C.D     UGSc            2        0     en0 /code/pre  But I don't understand why the original codedefault/code entry didn't suffice? The documentation for the codeI/code flag reads:  precodeI       RTF_IFSCOPE      Route is associated with an interface scope /code/pre  So how does that codedefault/code entry's codeI/code status prevent its use for my stated goal? (I've asked a related question to the same effect here.)  <answer16677> The solution was to perform the following:  precodesudo /sbin/route -n delete default A.B.C.D sudo /sbin/route -n add -net A A.B.C.D sudo /sbin/route -n add default E.F.G.H /code/pre  (details as to the above can be found in the question.)  <comment18157> If your VPN software prevents this (some are set up to only work if ALL traffic goes over the VPN) you will have a hard time of this. If is doesn't restrict, then you simply make the latter connection's router as the default route and set up network routing for each network you want to go through the VPN. <comment18159> @bmike: Can you explain a little more how to do what you propose? I'm not well versed in network configuration. <comment18160> OK - we might need a chat room for this. Can you hit me up here for some Q/A? http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/643/discussion-with-bmike <comment18162> It looks like this might be a good place to start. http://superuser.com/questions/4904/how-to-selectively-route-network-traffic-through-vpn-on-mac-os-x-leopard Also, I'll put some unorganized ideas in a chat room - hit me up there if you want more discussion before I can know how to propose an answer. I don't know how much detail you want on networking... http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/643/discussion-with-bmike
