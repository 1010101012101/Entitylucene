iPad mini selective restore: Is it possible and how? <body> I have reset my iPad after backing it up. I have set it up as a new iPad with the same Apple ID. I originally wanted to sign in with another but the 'emcould not sign in/em' error wouldn't stop appearing.  Now with the new iPad, I want to restore my data for my games, contacts and photos but do not want to restore my game progress in certain games and especially my Gamecentre account, which I created with a different ID.  I have heard about iMobie phone rescue need to know whether it's legit and viable.  Is there any way to selectively restore data?
