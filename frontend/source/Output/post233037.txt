Apple Id Confusion regarding I Tunes gift card redemption <body> To start off with I am the proud owner of two different apple email addresses: I have one ending in me.com and a second which came up later ending in iCloud.com.  That has apparently not been a problem except that when I send an email from either address it gets duplicated.  But I recently redeemed a couple of gift cards for the Itunes store and Im guessing I must have generated a third IDsomehow because when I made purchases I get an email receipt to my gmail address, which I referenced when I purchased the gift cards.    the problem is I have no idea what that last Id is and therefore can no longer access my gift card balance.  Any ideas on how I can reset the Id used to redeem the gift cards?  <comment284839> With which account are you logged into the iTunes Store?
