Is it possible to spell a word to Siri? <body> Is it possible to spell a word to Siri? For instance, if I ask for the stock price of a certain company, she doesn't always understand the company name.  <answer30194> I'm afraid that's not possible. You can't force Siri. At least, not yet.  <answer30197> Custom responses and informing Siri of specific words or spellings is not possible at the moment, but Apple itself has stressed that Siri is in beta status. That's not a label they use lightly, so I'd expect big improvements down the road.  <answer30427> It doesn't work reliably but there are a few commands for spelling things out in Siri.  Here's an article about it: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/10/20/how-to-type-comma-using-siri/  It sounds like some Dragon Dictate commands work.  <answer32621> Try saying: "no caps on, no space on", then spell the word, then say "no caps off, no space off".   <answer49044> You can say codeno caps on/code and codeno space on/code and then spell a word, letter by letter, followed by codeno caps off/code and codeno space off/code and Siri will understand that you spelt a word out for it to interpret.  You can see this in practice in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMNLV-qeou4  The context of the video is spelling words in Notes.app, so it's not clear if this works in all Siri contexts.  <answer280564> Actually you can. Try saying letter E  letter  F  Letter G and  so on. Similarly, you can  also say  Numeral  five if you want to type 5.  <comment34818> Great question. Siri is choking on my wife's name "Anne" using "and" or "an" instead. I'd love to be able to audibly spell or mark "Anne" but don't know a way to do it, yet. <comment60985> Quite frankly, I was totally surprised that Siri was released without a this. In my mind, spelling with code words: "codespell" "apple" "nancy" "nancy" "elephant" "end", to produce ANNE. That may seem like a lot but if you're in a car driving at 50 mph it is suddenly very practical. <comment61005> This works well Thanks. . Siri seems to understand spelt out words. But will put them in Caps and possibly add spaces. Hence "no caps on, no space on" <comment252489> This contains the same information as the currently-accepted answer on this question. It should probably be an edit to add the video to that answer, not a wholly new answer. <comment328132> I tried this on iOS 9. It didn't work very well. It seems that Siri reverts to the default behavior automatically after one phrase instead of preserving the no caps on, no space on mode.
