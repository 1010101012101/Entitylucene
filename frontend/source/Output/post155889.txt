iPod touch can't get IP address from Airport Express <body> I've got the following setup:  ul liDSL modem connected via Ethernet to an Airport Express/li liA second Airport Express extending the first/li liBoth Airports Express are the current model, running version 7.6.4 of their software./li /ul  Between the two I have nine working wireless client devices, mostly Macs and iOS devices.  However my 5th-gen iPod touch can't get an IP address. It emconnects/em to the wireless network, but keeps a self-assigned IP address. I can see this address both on the iPod touch and in Airport Utility (on a Mac). So I know it's connecting, but for some reason it can't get an address.  I've tried:  ul liRebooting the iPod touch/li liResetting network settings on the iPod touch/li liResetting emall/em settings on the iPod touch/li liUpgrading the iPod touch from iOS 8.0.2 to iOS 8.1/li /ul  No change. I could do a full wipe/restore on the iPod touch, but with everything above already failing, I'm skeptical it would help.  <answer156098> As often happens the solution was just to strongreboot all the things/strong. In this case it eventually turned out that the DSL modem (which is also the router) was the culprit.
