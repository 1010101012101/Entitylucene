Can an AppleScript create new variables on its own? <body> I have an AppleScript .app file that creates a list variable based on a website's HTML data. The number of items in this list varies based on the unique HTML data that is downloaded on every iteration, and can range from 1 to 50.  I ultimately want to display the contents of each line as its own drop-down menu in one dialog. I am using the external script library, emDialog Toolkit/em, to accomplish this, which requires the declaration of many additional variables.  emDialog Toolkit/em works differently than codechoose from list/code, for example. The codechoose from list/code dialog will automatically adjust its size to add a new line for each list item. But, for a emDialog Toolkit/em dialog, you instead must emseparately/em define (i.e., as its own unique variable) every drop-down menu that is needed. If you don't, zero drop-down menus will exist in the dialog.  Hence, 50 codeif statements/code are needed to ensure that the dialog contains all drop-down menus, like so:  precoderepeat with i from 1 to (count of theList)         if (i is 1) then             set {dropdown1} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)         else if (i is 2) then             set {dropdown2} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)         i if (i is 3) then             set {dropdown3} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)         else if (i is 4) then          ...          else if (i is 50) then             set {dropdown50} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)         end if end repeat  -- Note: The above code snippet is a very stripped down version of my code. /code/pre  Is it possible for an AppleScript to create, on its own, new variables that have formulaic titles?  Here is the type of thing that I desire:  precoderepeat with i from 1 to (count of theList)     set {(("dropdown" &amp; i) as variable)} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList) end repeat /code/pre  hr  subOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. /sub  hr  <comment367281> I do not believe that which you desire is possible. <comment367385> Thank you for the info. <comment373746> It's possible to `create multiples labeled dropdowns`  without needing 50 defined variables and 50 `else if` conditions.  I do not answer because it will not answer your original question. If you want an example of this script, change the title of the question, or post another question.
