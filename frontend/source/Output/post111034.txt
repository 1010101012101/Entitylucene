How do I link/call an actual shell script saved within an Applescript app? <body> What's the correct syntax in the Applescript below to make this app run by double clicking on it rather than how it runs now by just running the Applescript in the AS script editor?  The Shell script is located at:  ToggleHidden.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/toggle.sh  And it is set to execute by all.   (I did chmod a+x toggle.sh)  hr  Applescript  precodeset bottomRoot to (path to me) as alias   tell application "System Events"  set myPath to (POSIX path of container of bottomRoot)  end tell  set scriptPath to quoted form of (myPath &amp; "/toggle.sh")  do shell script scriptPath /code/pre  hr  Shell script  precode#!/bin/sh  STATUS=`defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles  if [ $STATUS == TRUE ];  then  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE  else  defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE  fi  killall Finder  sleep .5  open . /code/pre  <answer111036> Try:  precodeset myPath to POSIX path of ((path to me as text) &amp; "Contents:Resources:Scripts:toggle.sh") /code/pre  <answer111450> You could also just use do shell script:  precodedo shell script "killall Finder [[ $(defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles) = 1 ]] &amp;&amp; b=false || b=true defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool $b sleep .5 open -a Finder" /code/pre  <comment131113> Thank you adayzdone but it still wasn't working with the code line you posted. I've changed it up after several days of Googling and trial/error. Any other thoughts on my situation? Thanks again for your help. <comment131178> Thank you for the help in solving this! Perhaps I was trying to over complicate things. I'm pretty new to Applescript and was trying to write out something elegant and useful. I did have to drag the second line to fall in place directly after the first line and also it's weird that it ran on my MacBook (10.8.5) but when I sent it do my girlfriends and brothers it wouldn't run (all 10.8.5).  Any thoughts on that?  And again thank you!
