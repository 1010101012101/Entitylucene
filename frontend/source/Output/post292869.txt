How can I do it?  <answer292896> You can get your code.mobileconfig/code files from you iPhone/iPad backup (if you have an access to target device) as follows:  First, you need to create (or update) an strongunencrypted/strong backup from iTunes.  Then you need to get a path to your backup.

If you want to capture the information to use in macOS, I'm not sure this can be done. <comment369513> Thanks to you at first, I want to use this information to do some test of the IOS system. I know this file is a XML format file but I don't know where can I find it.
