How to View .tex file in IPython-Notebook of OS X? <body> My system: OS X El Capitan 10.11.5, Python 2.7.11, IPython 4.2.0 (Jyputer), Macbook Air 2013-Mid.  I would like to have Internet browser frontend for my LaTeX source codes. In my Jupyter, there is no .tex viewer, only downloading the .tex file when clicking it. You can view .py, .txt, .md, .log, .toc, .aux, .synctex.gz, .bbl and .blg files there currently. But not .tex and .sh.  Same behaviour in Google Chrome and Safari. You can open .tex file in Jupyter Notebook directly in Linux, etc Kubuntu 16.04, so it should be possible in OS X.  The problem can be that OS X does not have Python 3, but Ubuntu 16.04 has.  I am not sure how you could run IPython with Python 3 in the system, without the system Python.   hr  How can you use IPython Notebook as the viewer of .tex files?
