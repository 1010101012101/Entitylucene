NAS Shortcut won't stay in Favorites bar <body> In the past I had my network drive as a favorite in all Finder windows. Nowadays it doesn't work well.  When I connect manually CMD + K and type afp://192.168.178.28 the NAS root will be directly added to my favorites. But when I restart and OSX mounts the NAS automatically I can't get it in my favorites bar.  I googled and tested a lot, but nothing works, regardless if it's a AFP oder SMB connection.  Any thoughts what's wrong?  (P.S. using Mountain Lion and iMac 2011)
