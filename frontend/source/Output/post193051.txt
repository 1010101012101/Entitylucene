How to change owner of Time Machine HD? <body> I have a Time Machine HD from my old Mac. It has a different owner.  precodedrwx------+   9 admin  staff    374 Jan 13 13:02 Desktop drwx------+  11 admin  staff    476 Jan 11 15:56 Documents ... ... /code/pre  I try to change strongadmin/strong to strongsokada/strong.  precodesudo chown -R sokada Desktop /code/pre  But I get: "Operation not permitted to all files."  How can I change the ownership of a directory in a Time Machine Backup?  <comment229952> Why are you trying to change ownership of just a couple of directories?  Time Machine backups are protected against changes and require both temporarily turning off Time Machine and disabling the service that's protecting it from being changed.  Sorry I forget off the top of my head  what service and how, although I've done it in the past and I found the info using Google.  That said, I'd be vary careful modifying a Time Machine backup as you might corrupt it.
