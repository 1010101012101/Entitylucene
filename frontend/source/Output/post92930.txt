Facebook Contacts disappearing from contacts <body> I am using the iOS Facebook Integration, which adds my Facebook friends to my contacts in the phone app. Yesterday I noticed that some of these Facebook contacts have been disappeared, despite being still 'Friends' with them on Facebook.  Is this maybe due to some Facebook privacy feature?  <answer93440> It seems Facebook did this on purpose. Facebook tries to only sync contacts which include codeuseful information/code.  Friends without contact information other than a '@facebook.com'-email are no longer synced.  [Source]  <comment109088> Have the same issue. All of a sudden the number of contacts has decreased dramatically in my address book. <comment109095> Some Problem: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5075700
