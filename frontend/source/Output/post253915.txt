Setting custom user dictation commands programatically <body> I know that you can add a custom dictation command by going to codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Dictation -&gt; Dictation Commands -&gt; Add/code  Is there any way to do this programatically (maybe through the command line) such that I could add several dozens custom commands, rather than clicking through tediously?  Thanks
