Where do Folders Removed from the Finder Sidebar end up? <body> I just removed two document folders from my Sidebar in Finder, and now I can't find them! Any ideas on where they could have ended up?  Thanks!   Emma   <answer157184> The folders/documents in the sidebar are just shortcuts to the given folders/documents.  So if you just removed them from the sidebar they still are where they've been.
