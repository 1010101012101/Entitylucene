replace tilde to shift key in macbook <body> I try to change tilde key to shift.   I have success in it, but only for russian language.   I used codeKeyRemap4MacBook/code for it.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PLLai.png" alt="tilde to shift in KeyRemap4MacBook"  When I switch language to english this substitution stops working. How to make it work in both languages?  strongUPDATE/strong  From codeKeyRemap4MacBook eventViewer/code I found that my target key code is codeDANISH_DOLLAR/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QkTnQ.png" alt="KeyRemap4MacBook eventViewer"  And I set codeprivate.xml/code (code~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml/code) accordingly:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;TildeToShift&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;TildeToShift&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::DANISH_DOLLAR, KeyCode::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  I clicked codeReloadXML/code and watched results: nothing changed. I press my target key + codea/code, expecting to get codeA/code(shift+a), but instead see codeÂ§a/code img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xkYca.png" alt="KeyRemap4MacBook eventViewer"   strongUpdate 2/strong  Finally target key code is codeKeyCode::BACKQUOTE/code but not codeKeyCode::DANISH_DOLLAR/code although codeEventViwer/code showed codeDANISH_DOLLAR/code when I clicked target key.  This is because I swapped codeTilde/code and Section keys.  <answer114900> You can use a private.xml such as this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;TildeToShift&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;TildeToShift&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, KeyCode::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment134545> I copied this code to my `private.xml`, saved it and pressed button `Reload Xml` in `KeyRemap4MacBook`, but have no result. This key works as usual, not like `shift`. <comment134552> @efr On my keyboard, you hold shift and press the backquote key to get a tilde. Please use the EventViewer (In Terminal: `open /Applications/KeyRemap4MacBook.app/Contents/Applications/EventViewer.app`) to get the key code of the key that you wish to change to shift. <comment134554> using `EventViewer` I detected target key code, edit `private.xml` but still no result (see update above please) <comment134556> @efr Don't forget to enable the new TildeToShift option in KeyRemap4MacBook's preferences after you've reloaded the private.xml.
