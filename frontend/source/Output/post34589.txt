MacBook Pro won’t sleep automatically — no process preventing sleep according to pmset. What’s going on? <body> i noticed the following problem with my MBP 8,1 running 10.7.2 — automatic sleep just emdoesn’t happen/em. Since I usually put my Macbook to sleep manually before leaving the desk etc. I just noticed this issue and can’t really pinpoint it to specific updates.  What happens automatically is display sleep. Computer sleep just doesn’t occur.  Closing the lid works, selecting “sleep” from the Apple menu works. The only way to put my MBP to sleep automatically is currently PleaseSleep, which works fine.  Here’s pmset -g:  precodepmset -g  Active Profiles: Battery Power       1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay   4200  standby    0  womp       1  halfdim    1  panicrestart   157680000  hibernatefile  /var/vm/sleepimage  sms        1  networkoversleep   0  disksleep  10  sleep      10  hibernatemode  3  ttyskeepawake  1  displaysleep   3  acwake     0  lidwake    1 /code/pre  As you can see, no process is preventing sleep.  Here’s pmset -g assertions:  precodepmset -g assertions 25.12.11 03:05:34 MEZ    Assertion status system-wide:    ChargeInhibit                           0    PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep             0    PreventUserIdleSystemSleep              0    NoRealPowerSources_debug                0    CPUBoundAssertion                       0    EnableIdleSleep                         1    PreventSystemSleep                      0    DisableInflow                           0    DisableLowPowerBatteryWarnings          0    ExternalMedia                           0  Kernel Assertions: 0x0004   * Kernel Assertion ID = 500    Created At = 01.01.70 01:03:17 MEZ       Modified At = 25.12.11 02:46:14 MEZ       Owner ID = 0xffffff800b664000    Level = 255    Assertions Set = None (4)   * Kernel Assertion ID = 501    Created At = 01.01.70 01:03:21 MEZ       Modified At = 01.01.70 01:00:00 MEZ       Owner ID = 0xffffff800b674000    Level = 0    Assertions Set = None (4)   * Kernel Assertion ID = 502    Created At = 01.01.70 01:05:31 MEZ       Modified At = 25.12.11 02:38:13 MEZ       Owner ID = 0xffffff800b704200    Level = 0    Assertions Set = None (32) /code/pre  Any ideas? I tried resetting the SMC, to no avail.  Bluetooth is off, Sharing is off. Automatic sleep doesn’t occur both on power adapter and battery power. Unplugging USB hub with things like keyboard/mouse connected makes no difference.  Thanks in advance!  strongEDIT/strong Just booted into safe mode, and automatic sleep definitely works then.   strongEDIT 2/strong After removing Google Software Update, automatic sleep miraculously started working again.  <answer34607> Do you have Bluetooth turned on and if so, in the advanced tab of the bluetooth preference panel to you have the checkbox checked that allows bluetooth devices to wake your computer?  I had a similar problem and found that my magic mouse was preventing hibernation with the lid open.  <answer38951> I made two changes:  ul liDisallowed bluetooth devices to wake up computer;/li liUninstalled google notifier./li /ul  Now the computer will sleep  <comment39510> I'm not familiar with pmset.  What are you expecting it to show when sleep is being prevented?  I have Caffeine turned on right now and the output from my pmset looks almost exactly the same as yours. <comment39511> Have you tried setting the computer sleep time in System Perferences  Energy Saver to something else? Say 5 minutes? Sometimes manually sliding the bar triggers the proper event again. <comment39514> i have exactly some problem with you? and check the process 500, 501, 502 but there is no process running <comment39523> @MitchLindgren It should look something like this:  `sleep 0 (imposed by %processnumber)`  http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/osx_lion_pmset_shows_app_imposed_sleep/ <comment39524> @cksum Yes, I tried setting computer sleep to 1 and 2 minutes. <comment39525> @ade I don’t think these are process numbers. <comment39526> Look what happens when I do pmset noidle in the terminal, a command preventing idle sleep:  `pmset -g  Active Profiles: Battery Power  1 AC Power  -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay 4200  standby 0  womp  1  halfdim 1  panicrestart 157680000  hibernatefile /var/vm/sleepimage  sms  1  networkoversleep 0  disksleep 10  sleep  0 (imposed by 967)  hibernatemode 3  ttyskeepawake 1  displaysleep 3  acwake  0  lidwake 1`  pid 967, not surprisingly, points to pmset. <comment39527> Bluetooth is off, no Magic Mouse or other bluetooth peripherals. <comment39533> Wake for network access checkbox in Energy Saver? <comment39534> Doesn’t help — no automatic sleep, no matter if “Wake for network access” is checked or not. Just found out though that in Safe Mode, automatic sleep works. A 3rd party app or extension has to cause this. <comment39701> With Caffeine turned on I get `sleep 30` in pmset, so it doesn't look like that's a reliable way to determine which processes may be preventing sleep.  I occasionally experience problems with sleep not happening correctly, but I haven't been able to sort them out.  Usually I just reboot and then the problem will go away for a while. <comment43252> Did you test in between safe boot and uninstall of Google SU?
