How to show directories before files in Finder? <body> I would like to have windows in the Finder sort directories before files, in the manner of Microsoft Windows' Explorer as well as Linux KDE.  I tried following this link but it did not yield the desired outcome, specifically some directories had contents sorted that way but some had files first then directories and some were still mixed.  Also, I would like to know what the difference is between codesorting/code and codearranging/code in the codeShow View Options/code screen.  <answer98930> If you want to view things in a more Microsoft Windows-like fashion, there are several third-party commercial utilities that can provide more options. I do not know which of these will provide the exact layout you want, but you can download trial versions of one or more of the following:  RAGE Macintosh Explorer (This app is free)  Binary Age Total Finder  CocoaTech Path Finder  St. Clair Default Folder X (for Open and Save dialog boxes)  <comment116259> Did you `killall Finder` from terminal? <comment116260> yep and still doesn't sort after reopening <comment116261> i wouldn't attribute this style to Windows only, e.g. my Fedora KDE filesystem browsers (e.g. Thunar and Nautilus) do it that way also.
