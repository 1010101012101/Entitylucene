Rules for from account in Apple Mail <body> I happily use mail with several accounts. When I send a new email I often forget to choose the correct 'From' account. Is there a mail plugin that allows to set the default 'From' account using some rules.  One example could be: if the recipient ends in 'code@example.com/code' use the emwork/em account.  Or as an alternative is there a way to change the 'From' dropdown menu using a key combination? (this would not solve the case when I forget to set it but would at least speed up the process)  <answer52425> If you use the unified inbox then this can be a problem. If you expand the mailboxes and read them from those, then you can set-up Mail to send using the account for that mailbox.  I suppose this may require remembering to select the correct mailbox in a similar way to remembering to select the from account though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HYxwm.jpg" alt="Composition settings"  <answer175440> I struggle with the same problems. The answer is that there currently unfortunately is neither a plugin nor a hook for manually solving this problem.  For details look here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/67082/93032  Some workarounds for the problem can be found here: Mail.app extension to avoid sending email from the wrong account?  <comment59978> Yes I though about this but as you mention this would lead to the same problem: remembering to choose the correct account :-) <comment60003> Are there other mail clients that are more sophisticated and have this feature?
