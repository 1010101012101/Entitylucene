Is there an undo column feature in Word? <body> I am new to Microsoft Word.  I accidentally formatted a section as columns and now cannot undo it.  My whole (large!) document is now in column mode and I cannot get it back to normal mode.    I have tried View/Styles/clear formatting and it only clears all my other formatting but not the columns.  <answer54251> Assuming that:  ul liyou are speaking about Microsoft Word/li liyou formatted your document with multiple columns/li liyou are using Word 2011 (latest version)/li /ul  You can change the column setting in the "Format", "Columns..." menu  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S1qn3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment62098> I suppose  you are speaking about "Microsoft" Word. There's (to my knowledge) no such thing as "Macbook Word". Please edit your question and clarify. Then: what do you mean by "column" mode? Did you format your document as having more columns? What happens if you reduce the number of columns to 1?
