Use a custom version of clang in Xcode <body> I installed the recent version of clang (to code/usr/local//code). How do I set up Xcode to use this and not the built-in version of clang?  <answer280433> This is a copy of my answer on StackOverflow: How can I force Xcode to use custom compiler?.     People say it is possible with custom toolchains. I didn't make a research on them because easier solution worked well for me:           It is also possible to run frontend plugins directly by setting appropriate "build settings" of Xcode. (Several ways to do this, you can set them on the command line for instance: xcodebuild build FOO=bla.) Here are a few build settings that I found useful to inject C flags:           OTHER_CFLAGS, OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS or to replace the compiler(s) and linker(s):           CC, CPLUSPLUS, LD, LDPLUSPLUS, LIBTOOL           The same approach works to control the "analyze" action: CLANG_ANALYZER_EXEC, CLANG_ANALYZER_OTHER_FLAGS           Disclaimer: some of those build settings are undocumented (afaik). Use at your own risk.         (Taken from [cfe-dev] Compile/refactor iOS Xcode projects)      For me it was enough to define the following User-Defined Settings in Build Settings of Xcode projects:      CC=my-c-compiler      CXX=my-cxx-compiler      LIBTOOL=my-linker-for-static-libraries   <comment110588> This should be on StackOverflow as is about development tools <comment110616> @Mark as for your own [question](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1642/xcode-questions) in Meta, the question shouldn't be considered off-topic. <comment110620> @Thecafremo - This is not about how to use the windows in Xcode which could be considered OSX use but about how to program with Xcode (also I think this has been answered in SO before) <comment110643> @Mark He is asking for a way of *configuring* Xcode, not a way of *developing* with it.
