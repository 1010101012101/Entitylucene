How do I change from English to my native language in Xcode? <body> My whole system is in my preferred language, except Xcode. There's no use Googling em"Xcode change language"/em or even em"xcode change language -iphone -IDL -parse -Python -app -localization -internationalization -swift -objective-c"/em, it only turns up developer questions.  How do I change the UI language for Xcode?  <answer197656> As Tom pointed out, XCode is only available in english on the Mac App Store !   If you look on other apps you'll see the available localizations for example on Apple's Number.  <comment236341> XCode might not be available for every language. What is your prefered language ? (Is it somehow exotic ?) <comment236343> @MatthieuRiegler I don't know, is Swedish exotic? :) Doesn't anyone have their Xcode in another language? Spanish, French, Japanese? <comment236344> Look at the entry for Xcode in the app store.  It says English only. <comment236345> It's only English. Look inside `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Resources/`. There's only `English.lproj` directory.
