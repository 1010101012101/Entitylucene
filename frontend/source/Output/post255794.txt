Safari 10 : tab unresponsive / unable to close <body> I having a issue with safari 10, (OSX 10.12.1), often one tab get unresponsive, and I can't even close it, but other tab and safari preferences are working fine.  No extension enabled, no plug in, cache cleared ... I don't know what to do.  Any idea how to fix this?  From Console I received this errors / alerts :  precodeerror   06:36:16.281404 +0100   parsecd network_config_has_proxies_configured network_config_has_proxies_configured is deprecated error   06:36:16.281439 +0100   parsecd tcp_connection_get_remote API Misuse: Function must be called after tcp_connection_start error   06:36:16.281497 +0100   parsecd tcp_connection_is_cellular API Misuse: Function must be called after tcp_connection_start error   06:36:17.227946 +0100   WindowServer    _CGXRemoveWindowFromWindowMovementGroup: window 0x231 is not attached to window 0x237 error   06:37:35.051831 +0100   ScriptMonitor   Detected missing constraints for &lt;private&gt;.

The way your question is currently written makes it very difficult to determine what the problem is. <comment318800> Good idea, thank you <comment318968> Updated with console errors / alerts <comment319642> @KevinCork, I have the exact same problem.  Already removed almost all content under my ~/ with find .|grep Safari.  Re-configured Safari.  Still the same.  I've noticed this behavior on github.com and some other sites, notably bitbucket.org.  Not sure why these sites.  Again, Chrome opens this sites without any problem. <comment319643> now I see why many people using Chrome on mac, even Safari has very nice design, still glitches occur time to time. <comment319645> I read it could be because of the Nvidia driver, still having the issue , tried a few thing too but no luck
