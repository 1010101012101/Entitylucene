Bash not running script at /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ <body> I wanted to have bash autocompletion for git commands, so I dropped a bash script file into code/opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d//code.  When I open a new Terminal, the script file in code/opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d//code does not get executed. I have verified that the script file is working by running:  precodesource /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash /code/pre  Are there any steps missing here to ask OS X to automatically execute scripts in code/opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d//code?  <answer103819> Yes you need to load them into your shell.  This is done by editing code~/.bashrc/code or code~/.bash_profile/code and adding the command code. filename/code for each file. This loads the file and makes the functions available. i.e. put your source command in one of these files.  Note that you should not be adding to code/opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d//code as only macports should write there. Put the files in your home directory e.g. code~/.bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash/code  <answer195477> In order to automatically load all scripts from a directory, put this in your code~/.bashrc/code file   precode# LOAD ALL AUTOCOMPLETIONS IF ANY ARE INSTALLED if [ -d /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d ]; then     for F in "/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/"*; do         if [ -f "${F}" ]; then             source "${F}";         fi     done fi /code/pre
