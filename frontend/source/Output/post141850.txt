Adding document to the launchpad <body> Is it possible to add a document like a pages document or a screenshot into my launchpad? If so how do I do that  <answer141853> I was trying to do something similar - add a bunch of game .roms to my Games folder - and was told that Launchpad won't allow any item not ending in the application suffix of .app to appear, regardless of where you keep the file in question. So as far as I know there's no built-in or obvious way to accomplish adding any non-applications to the Launchpad.
