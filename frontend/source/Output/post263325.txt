Keyboard shortcut to open Mac menu <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut I can use to open the Apple menu? The closest thing I can find in the Apple documentationis pressing kbdCommand/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd?/kbd which opens the help menu (if one exists).  I'm open to suggestions that incorporate the use of third party apps like BetterTouchTool.  <answer263327> By default, Ctrl-F2 will move focus to the menu bar, placing it initially on the Apple Menu (but not opening it&mdash;you'll then have to press Space or down arrow to do that).   You can find/change this shortcut in the Keyboard System Preferences  Shortcuts tab  Keyboard section.  <comment329891> Perfect, exactly what I was looking for!
