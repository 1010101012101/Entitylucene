Setup a Wi-Fi which only works at login window <body> I have a Active Directory domain which has both Mac mini and MacBook as member computers. User login to those computers with their Active Directory credentials.  Because Mac mini has a Ethernet port, it is easy to configure the network login. But for MacBook, they only have Wi-Fi and user cannot join any network in the login window. Each user has a Wi-Fi account (WPA2 Enterprise) and it is strongseparate/strong from the domain account.  In this case, I enrolled all Apple devices to Profile Manager and distributed a profile with Network payload. In the profile, I setup a 'public' Wi-Fi account. Then all MacBook are able to login with domain account.  However, when users login, they are automatically connected to Wi-Fi with the public account. This is not what I expected. Is there anyway to setup a login-window-only Wi-Fi configuration, after login, ask user to login to Wi-Fi with their own account?
