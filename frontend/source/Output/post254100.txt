Notes Application not able to open after upgrading to MacOs Sierra <body> I have Macbook Pro 15" Retina display. I recently upgraded to macOS Sierra from El Capitan.  After upgrading, I am no longer able to open my Notes application.   I have important data on Notes; how can i recover or can fix this issue ?   hr  Please check it out and please help me what should i do. Thanks  <answer254182> I had the same issue. I went into System Preferences/iCloud and turned off Notes and turned it back on. I was then able to use the Notes app with no problem.  <answer256665> You have an mail account that is not working because of wrong password or something like that. You have to delete this account in Accounts from Mail menu. I had the same problem.  <answer261693> I had an old mail account which doesn't work any more, but in the codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Internet Accounts/code preference pane in the codeUse With/code list Notes were switched on for this account. After I turned it off I was able to launch Notes.  <answer269994> It should be safe to re-download the Notes application. The application itself does not contain notes; your iCloud account (or in some cases, your local file system) contains all the data.  <comment316835> how to update it ? can't able to find notes on apple apps store. <comment316836> I tried it, and still it's crashing :( <comment320170> The question is about Notes, *not* Mail. <comment320173> I had the same problem 5 minutes ago with Notes. I deleted the wrong mail account and now Notes is working <comment320178> before that, I click the option "Activate the account "In my Mac" in Preferences from Notes menu. I am translating to English because I have Spanish version. I'm sorry, if you read any differences.
