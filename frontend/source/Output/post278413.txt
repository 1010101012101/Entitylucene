Including server names in file paths <body> We have two servers, codeServerOne/code and codeServerTwo/code. Each server contains a folder called Projects. On Windows, the paths to each of these folders are code\\ServerOne\Projects/code and code\\ServerTwo\Projects/code, respectively. On a Mac, the paths instead are code/Volumes/Projects/code and code/Volumes/Projects1/code. Depending on which order a user accesses the codeProjects/code folder from each server through the Finder, either one might be codeProjects/code or codeProjects1/code. Neither will be available through /Volumes in the Terminal until accessed through the Finder. Is there a reason for this behavior? Is it possible to include the name of a server in URLs so the path is absolute and more easily shared across platforms?  <comment350350> Instead of mounting the Projects folder, can you mount the  server (ie mount /ServerOne instead of /ServerOne/Projects)? (The only problem is if the system administrator doesn't allow you to mount that point.) Then your paths would be /Volumes/ServerOne/Projects and /Volumes/ServerTwo/Projects. <comment350360> You can use `/etc/fstab` to tailor the mountpoints, just [as you would on Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab) (with a few differences such as the [use of `vifs`](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060930150059172). There are a few more methods [here](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100403050702737).
