Please Help this concerned parent <body> My 15yo daughter has to have an iphone 5s with (IOS 9.2.1) platform and has been showing signs of sneaky behavior. Im not an iphone person but noticed that she signs out of her icloud account we created for her and why would she do this? We don't know what else to do. Due to the expensive lease on the device I don't want to get her anything different. She doesn't have any apps that raise suspicion that I know of(on her icloud). Any advice or things to look for is appreciated. Thank you.  <answer225305> Maybe take this phone to an Apple Genius and have them explain. I don't know the reason she is signing out of iCloud, but that in itself is nothing sneaky. Have you any control over this phone? Or her computer? Looking at a list of her installed apps might be interesting - but so would having a talk with her. Ask emher/em to explain. Kids want some privacy, of course - but have you looked at Parental Controls?  <comment273389> Yes, i have her phone for now and have used have parental controls before. If she uses messages with a different icloud account then removes it does it not stay on the phone? It says 1g of data from uninstalld apps. I want to give her some privacy, just want to protect her when i can. Thank you for your answer, i know it probably seems kind of like a dumb question for some of the technical folks on here. <comment273396> We can't give parental advice here. If you have  technical issues or don't know how certain aspects of an iPhone work, please describe in more detail.
