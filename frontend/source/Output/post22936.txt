Trouble installing sqlite3 on OS X 10.5.8 <body> I am trying to install Rails 3, but having trouble with sqlite3. First I tried  precode$ sudo gem install sqlite3 /code/pre  however, I got this error message: http://pastie.org/2419493  After googling around, I found a few things about installing/reinstalling the sqlite3 package in MacPorts. So I tried this:  precode$ sudo port selfupdate $ sudo port update outdated $ sudo port clean sqlite3 $ sudo port install sqlite3 /code/pre  Then tried the same gem install command above. Same problem. Here are my versions on the command prompt:  precode$ ruby --version ruby 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09 revision 32553) [i386-darwin9.8.0] $ rails --version Rails 3.1.0.rc6 $ gem --version 1.8.8 $ sqlite3 --version 3.7.7.1 2011-06-28 17:39:05 af0d91adf497f5f36ec3813f04235a6e195a605f /code/pre  I can find other reports of this problem on google, but so far none with solutions that work for me. Any ideas?  Edit: For troubleshooting, I tried running Combo Update 10.5.8, then repeating the above steps. Still no dice :-/  Edit 2: The executables ruby, rails, gem, sqlite3 are all installed through port. That's because I didn't want to mess with the binaries that came with OS X, but I wanted the updated versions. For instance, doing  precode$ which {ruby|rails|gem|sqlite3} /code/pre  results in  precode/opt/local/bin/{ruby|rails|gem|sqlite3} /code/pre  <comment25600> `sqlite3 ` shipped with Leopard so can't you just update your ruby bIndings with `sudo gem update sqlite3-ruby` <comment25603> When I try, I get:Updating installed gems Nothing to update <comment25608> Silly question: did you install the Mac OSX Developer Tools? <comment25612> Yes, I believe so. I got xcode and all that goodness <comment25614> Well, I gave up. To avoid this problem entirely, I bit the bullet and updated the binaries in /usr/bin/* instead of using the ones from MacPorts. I guess that something in 'gem' is demanding to look at the built-in versions even though I don't want it to <comment25676> Have you tried asking on Stack Overflow? Might get better results there.
