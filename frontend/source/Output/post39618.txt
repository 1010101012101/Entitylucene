iTunes Match: Lossless tracks in two locations <body> Is there any way to have my Lossless tracks in two places, and not have iTunes have them show up as duplicates?  Basically, I've got my full iTunes library at home, and I've got a subset of that at work.  My favorite albums at home are in Apple Lossless format. If I bring those tracks to work, they show up as duplicates to the matched tracks.  Any way around this, other than disabling iTunes Match?
