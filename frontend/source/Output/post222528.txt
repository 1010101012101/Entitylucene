Where is POSIX Ex editor on Mac? <body> Since Ex is a standard Unix editor (standardized by POSIX), I expect to be shipped with OS X, however it's linked into codevim/code instead as shown below:  precode$ stat /usr/bin/ex   File: ‘/usr/bin/ex’ -&gt; ‘vim’ /code/pre  My goal is to test some syntax within Ex it-self (not using extended codevim/code-like codeex/code syntax) in order to check if my command is POSIX-compliant.  Therefore where I can find the original Ex editor on OS X? Or if it was removed or not shipped with, how can I get it back?  <answer222531> You could install it using Homebrew. It is part of the brew codeex-vi/code package, e.g.:  precodebrew install ex-vi /code/pre  <comment269726> I believe vim has a mode which it claims to be a standard-compliant implementation of `ex`. Note that for any other package you install, you only have the author's word that it is standards compliant.
