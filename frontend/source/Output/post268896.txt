Time machine is stuck at "Preparing backup". How can I fix this without rebooting? <body> I have a MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012) which is dying.  The last few times I've had to reboot it, I got a white screen of death and have to reset the PRAM and SMC several times before it came back.  Given its worsening state, there's very little chance that this will work again.  On Thursday evening, I set a Time Machine backup going.  It said "Preparing Backup" so I left it.  It still said "Preparing Backup" Friday morning... and evening... and all of Saturday.. and still said it Sunday morning.  So I googled for what to do.  The things I've tried are:  ol liStop the backup, start a new backup./li liStop the backup, delete the inProgress folder, start a new backup./li liStop the backup, turn off Time Machine, delete the inProgress folder, turn on Time Machine, start a new backup./li liStop the backup, turn off Time Machine, delete the inProgress folder, eject the drive, delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist, reselect the drive for Time Machine, start a new backup./li /ol  In each case, it stayed on "Preparing backup" for over an hour; in the past, when it has worked, it always moved on within that amount of time.  The next thing the internet suggested was to stop the backup, delete the inProgress folder, reboot, and start a new backup.  But if I reboot, then I have no guarantee that I'll ever be able to use the laptop again.  The whole point of doing the backup is to give me some safety in case I do need to reboot.  How can I get my laptop to make a backup without rebooting it?
