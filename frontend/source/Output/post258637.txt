MacBook Pro, 15" (Early 2011), not booting <body> I have a MacBook Pro 15" (Early 2011) model which suddenly is not booting correctly.  h1Symptoms:/h1  ol liApple logo and loading bar appear.  /li liLoading bar loads part way, freezes for a while./li liScreen flashes momentarily, then grey screen appears./li liGrey screen stays forever./li /ol  h1Attempted troubleshooting:/h1  strongSafe mode:/strong symptoms unchangedbr strongSingle-user mode:/strong symptoms unchangedbr strongVerbose mode:/strong symptoms unchangedbr strongClear NVRAM:/strong Apple logo and loading bar appears, freezes, and stays that way forever.

Before I make that definitive conclusion, I'm wondering if there are any other ideas that I might try?  h1P.S./h1  On a side note that might be more relevant than I think, I noticed that this model is one of the models potentially implicated in the MacBook solder scandal (see https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/ which lists the 15" Early 2011 model as one of the model lines with problems).  The symptoms don't exactly match what is listed there.  I haven't noticed any video problems (except for when I was changing out the memory: I got a couple of strange all-blue screens, but that could just be a result of poorly seated memory).  However, is it possible that a failing video adapter could cause problems at boot time?  <answer258674> strongTry Resetting the  SMC/strong (if you haven't already, and see if that changes any of the mentioned behaviors)  ol liShut down the Mac./li liPlug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your Mac./li liUsing the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time./li liRelease all keys, then press the power button again to turn on your Mac./li /ol  The SMC or System Management Controller can require a reset and exhibit similar symptoms when malfunctioning. If this doesn't help, I can only suggest there may be hardware damage somewhere or possibly latent water damage side effects manifesting themselves.   <comment323387> You said you booted in "Verbose Mode."  Where did it hang?  Can you take a picture?  Also, have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected. <comment369219> Hi @Daniel, I have a similar problem, did you manage to fix it?
