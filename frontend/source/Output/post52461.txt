How to save and exit "nano .bash_profile" in Terminal? <body> I need to add some line to nano .bash_profile in Terminal. Then:  1) I enter with this command line: codenano .bash_profile/code  2) Add the line I need  3) now I don't know how to Save and Exit  I thought it is strong:w/strong + strongenter/strong. If this is correct I need some direction to use it.  <answer52462> No, code:w/code is a code/usr/bin/vi/code command. Use the combination kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdx/kbd to exit. You will be prompted to save the file if you have made unsaved changes.  hr  Nano is intended to be a bit friendlier / simpler to new users than vi/vim or emacs which both cater to more power users that have spent time learning how to use them effectively.  To get started in nano - look for commands along the bottom of the window when nano is open. (code^/code stands for the kbdcontrol/kbd key)  precode^X      (F2)            Close the current file buffer / Exit from nano ^O      (F3)            Write the current file to disk /code/pre  <answer148475> If you want to save the changes you've made, press kbdControl/kbd+kbd O/kbd. To exit nano, type kbdControl/kbd+kbd X/kbd. If you ask nano to exit from a modified file, it will ask you if you want to save it. Just press strongN/strong in case you don't, or strongY/strong in case you do. It will then ask you for a filename. Just type it in and press Enter.  If you accidentally confirmed that you want to save the file but you actually don't, you can always cancel by pressing kbdControl/kbd+kbd C/kbdwhen you're prompted for a filename.   <answer249819> Try      sudo nano .bash_profile   To open your file instead. This will create your file if it doesn't exist, or open it for editing.  <answer285852> ol liEnter codenano .bash_profile/code (It will open the code.bash_profile/code file in the nano editor) /li liAfter making changes to the file use  kbdControl/kbdkbdX/kbd (to "exit") /li liThen it asks for the changes to be made permanently and gives two options: codeYes (or) No/code      /li liPress kbdY/kbd and press kbdEnter/kbd to save the file/li /ol  <comment63676> I'm using control+O to save..but it keep asking 'File Name to Write: .bash_profile So how to make sure the 'edited' .bash_profile file is saved? <comment63677> Just press 'Enter' then <comment214823> Keep in mind the `shift` key is needed for ^X and ^0 , tripped me up at first when we're used to being given commands in uppercase and the shift key explicitly stated as a shortcut in OSX. <comment310003> This is not the right place to use `sudo` -- that runs `nano` as root. It doesn't even really answer the question which is how do you save changes and exit  nano. He already knows how to start nano. <comment310004> I know that it runs it as root. I had the same problem and doing the above fixed my problem. The accepted answer or an hour of research didn't.   So unless the OP says this doesn't answer his question, I would disagree that it doesn't. <comment324031> what is ^ sign? Pressing Shift + 6 and then X to create ^X seems not working! Got it, it seems ^ sign means Ctrl in linux world! <comment331188> ctrl + ^ + O will do the trick for you. <comment360604> @paranza ctrl and âŒƒ is the same thing.
