Why can't I easily open web browsers from the terminal application? <body> In order to run Chrome from the Terminal application, I have to do  precodeopen -a "Google Chrome" index.html /code/pre  rather than just something like "chrome index.html".  The same also seems to be true for Firefox.  It's not because I can't open any GUI applications from the command line. For example, I can do codemate ./code to open TextMate.  What's the rationale for web browsers not having a command like "chrome index.html"?  <answer178849> To open a application from the terminal it has to be in one of the paths of your code$PATH/code environnement variable.   By default code/Application//code where Chrome is located is not in your path. Therefore you can't launch an application without giving the full path to your app.   precode/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome http://google.com /code/pre  Will work.   <answer178850> It's probably safe to say that most Mac users do not open GUI apps via the CLI, which is why most GUI apps do not include the CLI support like TextMate does.  In other words, TextMate actually includes a binary executable named codemate/code which is installed in code$PATH/code, which is why one does not need to preface it with the codeopen/code command like opening a GUI app which does not include that type of CLI support.  If you want to emulate that behavior then create a script named codechrome/code placed in the code$PATH/code, typically code/usr/local/bin//code for something such as this.  Example:  precode#!/bin/bash  if [[ "$1" ]]; then     open -a "Google Chrome" "$1" else     open -a "Google Chrome" fi /code/pre  Save the above code in a plain text file named codechrome/code and make it executable by:  codechmod +x chrome/code  Then you can start Google Chrome via CLI by codechrome/code or codechrome URL/code where codeURL/code is properly formatted if not just a filename in the code$PWD/code.  <comment211905> It will work however you cannot then close Terminal without also closing Google Chrome.  In this case using `open -a Google Chrome` is the proper way as it's process is not terminated when closing the Terminal. <comment211914> Did you see my updated answer?
