Making use of fullscreen on the extended display <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do I run an app in Full Screen mode on OS X Lion on my second monitor?       I recently bought a MiniDisplay Port to VGA to make use of my unused monitor.  So far I'm using it but one thing I notice is that when I try to use the fullscreen option of a certain application, Safari for example, OS X Lion only seem to use the main display (my MBP's monitor).  When I drag Safari's window on the extended display and then fullscreen from there, the fullscreen window still returns back to the main display.  Is there a way for putting the fullscreen window to the extend display?  Cheers!  <answer62898> This is possible in Mountain Lion by dragging the window to the secondary screen before entering fullscreen, but unfortunately cannot be done in Mac OS X Lion.  <comment72577> I see.  This thread must be closed then.  I'm not doing my homework well. Thanks anyway! <comment72580> Feel free to remove your question if you agree it's a duplicate.
