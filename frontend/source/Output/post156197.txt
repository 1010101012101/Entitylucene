How do I display in console the domain names used by the OS X 10.10 DNS resolver? <body> I want to display the list and order of domains used by the resolved on OS X 10.10.  I know that they are taken via DHCP and you can overwrite them using network configuration tool but connecting to VPN can also change them and I do want to see the current list in the console.  How can I list them?  <answer156207> Open the terminal and enter the following command:  precodenetworksetup -getsearchdomains &lt;networkservice&gt; /code/pre  Network service refers to the interface you are using (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.). You can get a list of all interfaces by running the following command:  precodenetworksetup -listallhardwareports /code/pre  Once you find the name of the hardware port, use that name in place of  in the first command. For example, I generally use Wi-Fi so when I run the command it looks like this:  precodenetworksetup -getsearchdomains Wi-Fi /code/pre  <comment183706> So your looking for what name servers and domain the current connection is using?
