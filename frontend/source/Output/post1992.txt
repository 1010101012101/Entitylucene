iPhone says "The Apple Id you entered Couldn't be found or was incorrect. Please try again." <body> All of a sudden my iPhone 4 (iOS4.0.2) can no longer download apps. It says:     The Apple Id you entered Couldn't be found or was incorrect. Please try again.   I know for certain that the password is entered correctly. I have only 1 iTunes ID. I downloaded an app successfully this morning, over 3G. But now I consistently get this message when I try to download any app! I'm still on 3G with adequate signal strength.   I've quit all running apps, I've restarted (twice) and even a hard reset. But still I get this message. I've also noticed that the strongbattery level is falling rapidly/strong (1% every 2 min's) despite no other running apps/wifi/Bluetooth, so it must be doing some heavy 3G traffic.  strongWhat's up? How can I solve this?/strong Preferably emwithout involving my PC at home/em because I will be travelling for the next few days...  My exact steps:  ul litap on App Store/li lifind any (free) app, tap on codeInstall/code. Itunes closes, I see a white placeholder app icon labeled codeWaiting.../code, and I'm asked my iTunes password./li liI enter the correct password and tap codeOK/code./li liThe white placeholder icon is still codeWaiting.../code for a emlong/em time./li liAfter ~5min's the correct app icon is show, but still labeled codeWaiting.../code. /li liAfter additionally ~5min's there's a new popup with the text codeThe Apple Id you entered Couldn't be found or was incorrect. Please try again./code and buttons codeCancel/code and codeRetry/code./li /ul  Note: I've seen entries like this one but they are based on working on a Macintosh. I'm at work so I hope for a mobile solution.  <answer1993> strongThis might have been some kind of outage in the App Store,/strong because it works now, following the exact same steps with the exact same conditions (location, network, etc.).  <comment1717> Glad you got it resolved lol <comment4564> For what it's worth, I just got this too...  Hopefully it'll resolve itself for me, as well.  :-/
