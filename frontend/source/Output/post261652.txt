Get a password back out of iCloud keychain? <body> I recently had to change all my passwords - thanks to the 2013 Adobe hack I just learned about. So this time I used iCloud Keychain and let Apple suggest my passwords.  Ok, now how do I get them onto my Chrome on my PC laptop? Is there software to do that (google says no) or some way to see those passwords so I can just type them in?  <comment327644> If you open the app "Keychain access" on your Mac, you will be able to view saved passwords in your iCloud Keychain. No software to copy them over, so you'll have to do that manually.
