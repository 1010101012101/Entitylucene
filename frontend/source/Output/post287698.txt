AppleScript for lifting & stamping latitude & longitude of photos onto themselves <body> After repairing my Aperture library, I have over 3000 photos with latitude and longitude information whose place displays as "Unnamed location" on the map. If I lift and stamp the data using kbdShift/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd+kbdC/kbd followed by kbdShift/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd+kbdV/kbd, Aperture names the place automatically. However, I don't want to have to do this for all 3000 pictures manually.  I think it should be possible to automate the process using AppleScript. However, I'm not sufficiently experienced to piece it together myself and was unable to find any help googling. What I have so far is  precodetell application "Aperture"     set imageSel to (get selection)     if imageSel is {} then         error "Please select an image."     else         repeat with i from 1 to count of imageSel             [What goes here to lift and stamp latitude and              longitude of each individual photo onto itself?]         end repeat     end if end tell /code/pre  Any help, links or tips would be much appreciated.
