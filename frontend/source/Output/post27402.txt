Can I put Newsstand into a folder? <body> In iOS5 (and later) my newsstand icon will not go into a folder on either my iPod touch, or my iPad2. Anyone have any suggestions on how to move this application?  <answer27404> Newsstand behaves as a folder itself.  In the same way as you cannot nest folders within folders, Newsstand cannot be placed inside any other folder.    As a side note, jailbreaking makes folder nesting possible.  You can actually get it in a folder by making a new folder and very quickly placing it in as a third item, but launching newsstand from within a folder usually causes things to crash in the phone. Furthermore, the system cleans this up when it notices it - so you have a very short term win in terms of getting newsstand in to another folder.  Until this changes in the OS - the safest thing is to move it out of sight.  <answer27457> I've put in the last screen, all alone, so I never have to see that  <answer27529> Looks like there is a way after all (even if it's most probably a bug because it renders Newsstand useless):  From The Coding Massacre:  ol liTake two apps and go to create a folder/li liThe second the apps are in the folder and it’s doing the folder creation animation, drag Newsstand into the folder/li liAs long as you’re quick enough Newsstand will go into the folder/li /ol  If you open Newsstand while it’s in a folder your springboard will crash.   <answer37791> If you don't mind Jailbreaking your device, several apps allow this. One such app is NoNewsIsGoodNews which runs as an application.  http://opinionativereviewer.com/archives/3683  <answer68295> Actually, you strongcan/strong put Newsstand into a folder- from Mac or Windows. Just install  h2StifleStand (free)/h2  It's really a simple application and does not require a jailbreak. I've just tested it from an iPod touch 4th gen and it really "just works".  However, note that tapping Newsstand once its in its folder causes it Springboard to crash (as mentioned by above answers).  supThis could be useful for a little SpringBoard restart for those who don't want to jailbreak!/sup  <answer102251> With the latest iOS 7, you can place Newsstand in a folder without having to buy apps or jailbreak your device.   <answer104508> Just install the new iOS 7 (free from Apple via iTunes).  Jailbreaking and similar "hacking" procedures usually cause more problems than they promise to solve...  <comment31603> Good find, though this will likely get patched in a couple of weeks.  Probably the way to permanently do this is jailbreak. <comment31604> This works, but Newsstand gets moved back to its default location the first time you sync your phone, so it's unfortunately a very temporary fix. <comment31614> Oddly - my first and last screen are pretty fixed - the middle few are where I bury the duds and ugly apps that I'd rather not see often. <comment31654> You my friend are a genius. Great find! <comment36652> I can confirm - this causes a crash, good fun. <comment42883> Requires a jailbreak though... <comment43000> Yes this way is just for jailbroken iPhones. <comment51646> This method no longer works on iOS 5.1 <comment120411> [Nobody puts Baby in a folder.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28A9Jgo92GQ) <comment120413> Can we get a "Finally!" from the chorus? <comment122366> Is there any chance we could get you to accept the iOS 7 correct answer (assuming the accepted answer doesn't get updated now that I'm promoting this question with a bounty)? <comment122367> This trick doesn't work on iOS 5.1 and later and isn't needed since iOS 7 allows you to put newsstand in any folder you please. <comment122377> @bmike Yes, this: http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/13/iphone-users-rejoice-in-ios-7-newstand-can-finally-be-hidden-but-not-deleted/ <comment123278> Why the negatives? I'm an Apple Technician, my religion forbids me to jailbreak!!!
