Secure Login Equivalent on OS X <body> On Windows you can configure "Secure Login" so that you have to press kbdControl/kbd + kbdAlt/kbd + kbdDelect/kbd to show the login screen like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q6AqT.jpg" alt="Secure Login Windows"  Does this feature exist on OS X or is there a third-party application that can achive this?  <answer205807> strongShort answer:/strong No.  This feature does not exist on Macs.  On a side note, it's also useless in Windows too.  A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, CTRL+ALT+DEL sent a hardware interrupt to the PC's BIOS (which would immediately reboot the computer in the DOS days).  That interrupt also had the happy side-effect of breaking things like keyloggers and programs designed to steal your password, so when Windows NT arrived on the scene, Microsoft trapped that interrupt to prove that you were a real, live human sitting in front of a keyboard.  That has not been the case for many, many years.  I have no idea why we're still dragging this stupid three-finger salute around after all these years (tradition maybe?)  It offers no meaningful security these days and I personally disable it with Group Policy on every domain I administer.  <comment248145> Umm... but why? <comment248147> Same reason why you would do this on Windows.  Prevent a fake login screen from being shown that grabs your credentials. <comment248151> I don't think that can happen in Mac, also I only see these on public computers. <comment248152> It's a setting controlled in group policy and is enabled when you join a Windows computer into a AD domain. <comment248167> @ecnepsnai, CAD can be enable on a stand-alone PC running Windows and doesn't have to be connected to anything for that matter.
