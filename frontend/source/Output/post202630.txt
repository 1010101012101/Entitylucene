Change in sleep behaviour on MacBook Pro and ignoring settings on Yosemite <body> Recently (possibly since the 10.10.5 upgrade, but not sure) my MacBook Pro mid 2012 (non-retina) changed its sleeping behavior and I cannot seem to restore it. For years, I used a 48 hour hibernate delay (codeautopoweroffdelay/code). So when I close the lid or the codesleep/code timer kicks in, my MBP would codesleep/code (i.e. suspend to RAM) and pulse the Sleep Indicator Light (SIL) for 48 hours.  But recently my Mac will wake after approximately 1 hour of codesleep/code and go into another sleep mode. I believe it is codestandby/code, because the SIL will turn off, but when I open the lid it takes only slightly longer than after the regular codesleep/code state. In codehibernate/code / codeautopoweroff/code it would take a while to load the RAM content back from the disk (which is not the case here). This does not happen when a USB disk is connected.  Here comes my codepmset -g/code:  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay         172800  standby              1  womp                 0  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  gpuswitch            2  sms                  1  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            0  sleep                10  autopoweroffdelay    2880  hibernatemode        0  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         10  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  So my questions are:  ol liHave you heard about any recent sleep-related changes in OS X Yosemite? How come my Mac suddenly ignores its settings?/li liWhat standby state am I dealing with? See my guess above./li liAnd of course, how to make my settings work again?/li /ol  What I tried so far (will update):  ul liSMC &amp; NVRAM reset/li liOnyx maintenance/li liSet all timers anew, e.g. codesudo pmset -a autopoweroffdelay 2880/code, etc./li liChange codehibernatemode/code to code3/code as suggested by @rewozz/li /ul  <answer204644> A possible problem could be that you have Power Nap enabled. Power Nap is a service that periodically checks for email, iCloud updates, messages, etc. (in case you didn't know).  In order to check:  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liOpen the Energy Saver preference pane/li liSee if the "Enable Power Nap..." checkbox is checked/li /ol  Note that you may need Admin privileges to change these settings.  Hope this helps!  <answer204729> According to Apple:     We do not recommend modifying hibernation settings. Any changes you   make are not supported. If you        choose to do so anyway, we recommend using one of these three settings. For your sake and mine, please        don't use anything other 0, 3, or 25.   Further Apple states:     hibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by strongdefault on supported portables/strong.   The system will store a copy of memory memory         to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from        memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.   You have set:     hibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The   system will not back memory up to        persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on        power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.   Have you tried setting hibernatemode = 3?  Maybe the jig is up, Apple can drop support as they please; hence the warning.  <answer205232> As far as I know an apple laptop could wake on its own only because of:  ul liPowerNap (see system preferences/PowerSave/Battery/Power Nap)/li liWake on LAN (see system preferences/PowerSave/AC power/network accesses)/li lior an event received from an external connected device (USB, Bluetooth, ...) /li /ul  Maybe you could get a clue by looking at your system logs. For example:  ul lilaunch /Applications/Utilities/Console.app /li liand search for "wake reason"/li /ul  On my MacBook Pro (retina 2015), I only get "wake reason: EC.LidOpen (User)". Maybe there you could find why is your MBP waking up so frequently.  my 2 cents  <answer211800> I can't tell why you Mac wakes up, but here is how you could find out:  Type codepmset -b -g assertions/code in your terminal. That will list the drivers that have requested power setting overrides when running on battery.  You can also inspect the power management log, using codepmset -g log/code.  For example, on my 10.10.5 MacBook Pro 2015, I found out that leaving my Sandisk Ultra fit USB3 memory stick plugged in makes my Mac wake up every 3 hours. Here's why:  precode$ pmset -b -g assertions 2015-10-19 18:38:32 +0200  Assertion status system-wide:    BackgroundTask                 0    ApplePushServiceTask           0    UserIsActive                   0    PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0    PreventSystemSleep             0    ExternalMedia                  1    PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0    NetworkClientActive            0 Listed by owning process:    pid 51(powerd): [0x000000040008012e] 03:37:52 ExternalMedia named: "com.apple.powermanagement.externalmediamounted"  /code/pre  codeExternalMedia/code is set to 1 by process codepowerd/code.   Unfortunately I haven't found out yet how to prevent this. I looked for a "com.apple.powermanagement.externalmediamounted" plist file but could not find any... So I don't know if these driver overrides can be changed or disabled. :(  Anyway, I expect it is driver dependent, so changing the behavior should also be driver dependent...  This detailed web page seems to indicate that, for external media altering sleep behavior, the only option is to unmount or eject the external media. Based on the driver the external media uses, eject is sometime required while for other unmount is enought.  <answer215135> My Macbook Pro 13-inch (2012) also started to show weird signs. When I close the lid and open it after 5 minutes, it wakes up normally. But if I put it to sleep for an hour and wake it, my DVD drive would make a noise like on startup boot. I do not see the overexposed screen with a loading bar like after hibernation. So there is definitely some new kind of power sleep that seem to shut off power to internal devices. I have "Put hard disk to sleep" option unchecked too. And as you mentioned the Power Nap is not supported on this model. Does seem to be a new Yosemite setting.  EDIT - Although, I must admit I noticed that the battery now will last longer once my Mac is asleep for a while. After a few days in a sleep mode, I used to lose some substantial amount of power. Now it is just a few %. So I guess whatever they did, does help to preserve energy.  <comment246722> Thanks! However, it seems [my Mac does not support this feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204032). It does not appear in the Energy Preferences. Mine is the non-retina version - will update the question. <comment246723> OK! I will see if I can find anything else for you... <comment246836> Hmm. To be honest I use the App SmartSleep which alters `hibernatemode` depending on the battery charge :) So it will be `3` once the battery is below 20%. But I will give it a try & report back. Thank you! <comment246837> FYI SmartSleep was last updated 09 Sep 2013. <comment246847> I have been using it on 10.8 and 10.10 for 3 years now and it always worked without problems. <comment246889> Well you know how the saying goes, everything works until it doesn't. <comment247427> Changing `hibernatemode` did not help... <comment247495> Thanks for the answer. Actually I know why the Mac wakes: Because it changes its standby mode. What I **do not know** is why. But thank you for the hint with wake reason. The only one I could find was SleepTimer. Will check again tonight.
