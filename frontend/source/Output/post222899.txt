iMessage keeps popping up <body> How can I disable the iMessage pop up when I turn on my Mac? It keeps asking me to sign in with my Apple ID. I don't want to set it up because I don't want to use iMessage. But the box keeps opening every time I turn on my Mac and it is getting frustrating as I have to go through 3 pages before I can turn it off.  <answer222904> You can disable it through the Preferences in iMessenger app in your Mac. Follow this link  <answer222916> iMessenger is the iOS version for iPhone/iPad etc. On your Mac, it's called "Messages". Open Messages, go to your Preferences tab in Messages.

Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. Also, the Mac app is called Messages. <comment270469> Thank you everyone for the answers but it still didn't solve my problem. I think I wasn't clear about my intention. I just replaced my old iMac . The new one is using El Capitan while my old one was Snow Leopard. I don't want to use iMessage and so didn't set it up. But every time I turned my Mac on, the iMessage popped up and asked me to set it up - has two buttons .. either 'sign in' or 'not now'. I have no other choice. I clicked 'not now' and other windows popped up which said 'are you sure you want to skip iMessage set up?' <comment270471> I want to disable this set up process which keeps appearing every time I turned on my iMac.
