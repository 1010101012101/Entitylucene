Cannot change font size in Xcode 4? <body> Everywhere I look I see that in order to change the Font size in Xcode I simply click on the "fonts window button".br However, I can't.br I have a default install of Xcode, just started trying to use it the other day.  The fonts window button looks like this:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uj3uC.png" alt="enter image description here"    Notice how it is grayed out?  Nothing I can figure out will let me click on it to change the font size.  Is this a common problem?  Anyone have a clue how to fix it?  <answer50178> You have to select one or more categories in the list (on the right). Steps in Apple Docs  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kbx4B.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment221622> Well that was unnecessarily confusing, Xcode design, not your answer just to be clear. Thanks.
