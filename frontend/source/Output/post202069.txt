Add missing clips in an iMovie (iPad) Project <body> I've accidentally moved some movies (taken with the iPad) to my Mac using the image capture app. Afterwards, I've deleted the clips on my iPad to have more space to export the project.  Now, iMovie is looking for the videos on the iPad and can't find them (obviously). I've send all the videos with AirDrop back the the iPad, but it still cant import the missing clips.   Any ideas, how to recover / restore the videos in the iMovie project? Where do I need to put the videos?
