Capslock alterations break in new update? <body> I have (for years) mapped capslock to control. In Sierra, You could do this in the system preferences keyboard section.   On Friday, I did some system upgrades on my work machine. I came in this morning, and capslock is no longer control. I poke around and see that there are multiple keyboard configurations in the keyboard section (was that there before?) I make all of them capslock-ctrl, and now my capslock is control. However, it's STILL a lock key, so now it's Control-Lock, which is silly.  How can I cun off the locking aspect of capslock?  System:  Macbook Pro, osX 10.12.4, using an external microsoft Natural keyboard (wired). This doesn't happen on the internal keyboard, only the external.  It's possible that this is a Microsoft Keyboard problem, but I figured I'd ask here first.  <comment359057> And now it magically seems to work again? gah.
