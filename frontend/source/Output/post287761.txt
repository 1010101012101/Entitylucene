Unable to enter password in entry box when requested for reinstalling macOS <body> recently I attempted a fresh, clean reinstall on macOS on my 2015  MacBook Pro 13 inch by rebooting and pressing cmd+r to open the option to reinstall macOS. When I select the boot volume (after the agreement), it prompts me for a password. However when i attempt to type in my password, it does not respond. It does not show any masked characters when using it, and when i pressed enter and ok to get a response, I got nothing.   Any ideas as to why?
