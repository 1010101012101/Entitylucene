How to uninstall Preference Panes? <body> I am running OS X Sierra on a MacBook Air. I don't remember exactly how, but quite some time ago I installed CUDA on my Mac (I was a newb then, I didn't know I wouldn't be able to run it without an NVIDIA GPU).  So after installation I was always greeted by this box upon login:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qA2p3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I wanted to remove this and all other traces of CUDA from my system. I did codelocate cuda/code and deleted all the files which seemed related to CUDA. There were some occurrences of CUDA in OpenCV and Homebrew which seemed useful, so I kept them.  The good thing is that I am no longer greeted by this message at startup, but I can still see the link to the codeCUDA Preferences/code in my codeSystem Preferences/code (see circled area on bottom left):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zr5BJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Every time I click on this icon, codeSystem Preferences/code "quits unexpectedly". This means that there are still traces of CUDA left on my machine. How can I remove it completely?  <answer294241> strongThe Easy Way to Uninstall Preference Panes/strong  Remove preference panes with just a click or two:  ol liLaunch System Preferences by clicking the System Preferences icon in the Dock, or by selecting System Preferences from the Apple menu./li liRight-click the preference pane you wish to remove.

The first location is used for preference panes that are only used by you.  You'll find these personal preference panes located in your home folder in the Library/PreferencePanes directory.  ul li~/YourHomeFolderName/Library/PreferencePanes/li /ul  The other location for system preference panes is in the system library folder. This location is used for preference panes that can be used by any user who has an account on your Mac.  You'll find the public preference panes located at:  ul li/Library/PreferencePanes/li /ul  Once you figure out which folder a preference pane is located in, you can use the Finder to go to that folder and drag the unwanted preference pane to the trash.
