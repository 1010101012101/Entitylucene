Why does an empty `~/Movies` folder take up 273 GB? <body> My code~/Movies/code folder is empty according to both the Finder and Terminal.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GlgD4.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've never seen this before. In case it's relevant, this is a 2012 Mac mini running the latest version of Yosemite. It runs a few services, including file sharing, FileMaker Server, calibre, Time Machine and Plex.  <answer242425> Based on the suggestions in the comments, I performed the following commands in the terminal:  precode~ $ cd Movies/  Movies $ du 0   .  Movies $ ls -la@ total 0 drwx------+  2 administrator  staff   68 Jun 11 13:41 . drwxr-xr-x+ 23 administrator  staff  782 Jun 11 21:31 ..  Movies $ touch file  Movies $ ls -la total 0 drwx------+  3 administrator  staff  102 Jun 12 10:20 . drwxr-xr-x+ 23 administrator  staff  782 Jun 11 21:31 .. -rw-r--r--   1 administrator  staff    0 Jun 12 10:20 file  Movies $ rm file  Movies $ ls -la total 0 drwx------+  2 administrator  staff   68 Jun 12 10:20 . drwxr-xr-x+ 23 administrator  staff  782 Jun 11 21:31 ..  Movies $ mkdir dir  Movies $ ls -la total 16 drwx------+  4 administrator  staff   136 Jun 12 10:20 . drwxr-xr-x+ 23 administrator  staff   782 Jun 11 21:31 .. -rw-r--r--@  1 administrator  staff  6148 Jun 12 10:20 .DS_Store drwxr-xr-x   2 administrator  staff    68 Jun 12 10:20 dir  Movies $ rm -r dir  Movies $ ls -la total 16 drwx------+  3 administrator  staff   102 Jun 12 10:20 . drwxr-xr-x+ 23 administrator  staff   782 Jun 11 21:31 .. -rw-r--r--@  1 administrator  staff  6148 Jun 12 10:20 .DS_Store  Movies $ du 16  .  Movies $ du -h 8.0K    .  Movies $  /code/pre  Get Info on the folder now reveals it to have 6K (for the code.DS_Store/code that showed up with the folder creation, no doubt). Honestly, I didn't check the Get Info after each command, so I don't know which, if any of the above fixed it.  <comment298049> what does the command line tool du show for the directory? <comment298069> Try `ls -la@` and see if there's a difference? <comment298072> What happens if you create a file and then delete the file from that folder? How about if you create a folder and then delete it from that folder? I'd also try opening Disk Utility and running First Aid on your Frodo drive. <comment298088> Try showing hidden files. There might be a .Trashes folder or .DS_Store folder that you can't see but is taking up all that space. <comment298105> @NoahL `ls -la` shows hidden files which was included in the screenshot.
