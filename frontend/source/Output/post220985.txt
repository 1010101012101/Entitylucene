Looking for an external monitor for my late 2008 aluminium macbook <body> I have the above laptop and thinking of getting a new, larger monitor to go with it. I have already reviewed other threads here and elsewhere, but there are a few things I am not clear about... The Macbook has a mini displayport, so I will need an adapter. If I wish images AND sound to be available, which adapter will work (best)? M-DP to HDMI or DVI? I couldn't find a definitive answer... Also, if I want to use the laptop in clamshell mode, how am I supposed to connect a new keyboard (I have a bluetooth one in the house) and a mouse to it?  <answer221025> This Samsung 27in monitor should suit your needs.  It's got a fast 4ms response time, good brightness, and it's pretty large, 27 inches.  Get a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI connector which carries both video and audio.  Turn on and set up your Bluetooth devices which should still keep connected while the laptop is in lid-closed mode, or you can connect a keyboard and mouse through the USB ports or a USB hub.
