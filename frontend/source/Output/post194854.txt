sudo: effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root? <body> I was trying to remove some folders (python) via codesudo rm/code in Terminal and got this message:  precodesudo: effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root? /code/pre  I already tried to verify/repair disk permissions (only shows 1 error, apple's remote agent), but that didn't help.  precode$ sudo sudo: effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root?  $ type sudo sudo is hashed (/usr/local/bin/sudo)  $ ls -@@eil /usr/bin/sudo 2215747 -r-s--x--x  1 root  wheel  164560 Sep 10  2014 /usr/bin/sudo  $ md5 /usr/bin/sudo md5: /usr/bin/sudo: Permission denied /code/pre  OS X 10.10.4  <answer194856> Your command code/usr/bin/sudo/code isn't running with the correct access modes or you are not running the codesudo/code you think.  To help you identify the exact nature of what is wrong, run the following commands in a codeTerminal/code:  precodetype sudo /code/pre  (to check you are using the true codesudo/code without any intervening subshell)  precodels -@eil /usr/bin/sudo /code/pre  (to check modes, owner, group, and extended access list of the correct binary)  precode/usr/bin/sudo md5 /usr/bin/sudo /code/pre  (to check no one tampered with your binary codesudo/code).  <answer194858> For whatever reason, you have a codesudo/code installed in code/usr/local/bin/code (see the output of codetype/code). Did you install something with homebrew or another package manager?  To fix, run  precode/usr/bin/sudo mv /usr/local/bin/sudo /usr/local/bin/sudo-strange /code/pre  or (if you want to get rid of it completely)  precode/usr/bin/sudo rm /usr/local/bin/sudo /code/pre  <comment232525> Please add within your original question (OQ) which version of MacOS X you had this error message. <comment232526> thank you for answering, edited in question @daniel <comment232529> edited again, didn't use *type sudo*, seems like I'm using a wrong sudo (should be in another folder, right?) @daniel <comment232531> thank you, yes, i did some installing with homebrew (python etc), i did what you wrote, but how do i tell os x now to use /usr/bin/sudo as default? @patrix <comment232538> Once you rename/remove the `sudo` in `/usr/local/bin`, things should be back to normal. You can also run `hash -r` to make the shell forget about the location of `sudo`. <comment232543> Right! (+ garbage for the robot) <comment232546> Are you sure you want to use this `/usr/local/bin/sudo`?↵ Do you know its origin?↵Did you install it? <comment232562> i don't know where it came from, maybe homebrew, but I deleted it, now os x is using the right one, thank you for helping! <comment232563> okay, thank you! <comment232588> Feel free to borrow the useful part of my answer (which wasn't complete) to make a complete one of yours. I'll remove my answer. <comment232589> It's modification date might have helped you. This will be for another question next time you hit a binary not being the one you think.
