What happens if I plug a 2016 MacBook Pro into itself? <body> The charging cable on the 2016 MacBook Pro is USB-C both ways, allowing me to plug the MacBook into itself. What happens if I do this?  <answer265678> It probably will detect it as a short circuit and shut down. I would not do it, if I were you.  <answer265695> We just tried it with my friends laptop It charges itself (well... it thinks it does)  <answer265699> The new MacBook Pros have circuitry in all USB-C ports so that the charger can be plugged into any port.   Plugging a two-way USB-C cable will just make the device think that it's charging as technically there is a power source coming from one of the ports into the other.  It doesn't actually charge anything but the reporting is what's making the battery icon show 'charging'.   <comment333102> Please refrain from speculations when adding an answer. <comment333110> Since nothing special happens when you connect it to another macbook pro I expect nothing happens when you connect it to itself, I just don't dare to try it with mine :# <comment369648> It absolutely wouldn't cause a short circuit.
