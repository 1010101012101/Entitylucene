Apple Maps & E-Z Pass (detection?) <body> I've been driving a bit lately up and down the east coast of America and I realized that Apple Maps constantly tells me to "stay left" when going through tolls.  Every toll that I have gone through has E-Z Pass only lanes on the far left.  Some of them split up early so if you get into the left lane you're stuck there.  strongDoes Apple Maps detect the E-Z Pass in my car?/strong  If I was more oblivious while driving and I didn't have one, I could end up with some hefty fines.  <answer147866> I don't think so.  I'm not aware of any such feature on the iPhones or Apple Maps and haven't been able to find anything on the matter to definitively say either way, so I can be totally wrong even though I haven't found anything to suggest that's the case.  Moving on to this "keep left" thing - I can't explain it. I can be driving down a straight freeway with no exits in sight and Siri will tell me to keep left for seemingly no reason.  Take it as an unintentional friendly reminder to get in the E-Z Pass lane and hope they don't patch it. ;)  <answer219314> Well I do not have E-Z Pass and it sent me to the left and I couldn't get out of it and I had to pay a $60 fine instead of an $8 toll fee.  <comment265280> It seems like an answer that "no" - it's not aware of which of several toll lanes you should choose.
