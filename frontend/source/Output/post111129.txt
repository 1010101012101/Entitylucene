Unable to connect to TP-Link wireless router with iPad 2 <body> I work in an office of 3 developers, all of whom own an iPad. Two of the developers have an iPad 3, and I have an iPad 2.  I am the only one that cannot connect to the TP-Link TL-WA801ND Wireless Router.  I have tried the classic troubleshooting technique of turning the router and iPad off and back on again, but to no avail.  My iPad 2 model number is codeMC769B/A/code and I am running iOS 7.0.4 code(11B554a)/code.  I can connect to the building's Wifi network fine, and also when i'm at home I can connect to my own router and extender without any problems.  What could be the reason that I can't connect?  <answer111909> Despite going through the TP-Link support channels I ended up resolving this problem by using the 'Forget this network' option in iOS and then manually connecting again by entering the AP name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LAam0.png" alt="enter image description here"
