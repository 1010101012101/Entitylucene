Does OSX have a nice feature to quickly drag windows via key press? <body> h2Synopsis/h2  On linux one could hold kbdalt/kbd and then drag any window around from any point within it's focus.  Is there similar functionality on OSX?   <answer130652> I recommend strongBetter Touch Tool/strong http://www.boastr.de. You can customize not only window dragging but also custom gestures, window snapping and more.  Edit: Dragged window doesn't have to have focus. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oygPZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment153255> In reference to your edit - this is great similar to Linux where by 'focus' is based on the object where the mouse sits without the need to focus.  As for the library works a treat :) thanks bru
