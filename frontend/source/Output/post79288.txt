how do I restore the origial base band to my iPhone 3G which was unlocked with Cydia? <body> I have an iOS 4.2 iPhone 3G which was unlocked utilizing Cydia. I understand that the base band was changed in the process. Now I am unable to upgrade to a newer iOS because it will reverse the unlock. I now realize that I can have my phone factory unlocked but not if the base band was changed.   Question is...can I restore the base band to it's original, and if so, how?
