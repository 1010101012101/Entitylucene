Programmatically setting Terminal default settings for all users? <body> I'm trying to set up some standard terminal settings for all users across our system on all machines.   I've tried to use the defaults write cmd in a LoginHook script, but since it seems that terminal executes the login script the settings don't stick.  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal "Default Window Settings" -string 'Homebrew' defaults write com.apple.Terminal "Startup Window Settings" -string 'Homebrew' defaults write com.apple.Terminal "Shell" -string '/bin/bash' /code/pre  Is there any way to pragmatically set Terminal settings globally across all users on a machine?  <comment115486> A related question is [here on SuperUser](http://superuser.com/questions/204686/how-can-i-export-all-my-terminal-app-settings-from-one-mac-to-another), which tells you how to export Terminal settings, which are stored in a plist. You might be able to use this file somehow. <comment115490> Yeah, that was actually my first approach.  I had my LoginHook script copy a "Set" version of com.apple.Terminal to the user /Library/Preferences. Still no go. <comment115497> Put the commands in a script and configure them to run at login as given in [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6442364/running-script-upon-login-mac/13372744#13372744) answer <comment115601> @crasic still doesn't work as launchd will still utilizes the terminal to execute the script.  The issue I'm having is not setting the correct variables via the cmd line its that terminal seems to revert back after the script exits.
