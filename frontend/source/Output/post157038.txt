What font is used to print a verbose mode boot? <body> When booting OS X in verbose mode (⌘V), the log is printed on screen.  It seems different to the kernel font, but it might just be a smaller version of it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fHO7q.jpg" alt="enter image description here" inverted screenshot Yosemite 10.10.1  Anyone know what font is used and have a credible source?  <answer162061> Using Identifont Fonts by Appearance search, the closest match is Leger. This seems more vertical, and not monospace, but is very close and could simply be a custom version of this font by Apple.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r8g2j.png" alt=""  <answer238369> Here kayover.deviantart.com/art/OS-X-Darwin-Bitmap-Font-609139414  <comment184666> I suggest you to take a photo and upload to [WhatTheFont](http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/). <comment184674> @jherran I can't get a clear enough photo. The text is far too small on a Retina display and too pixelated on a standard display, not to mention that a photo instead of a screenshot isn't really good enough when there's so many similar fonts it could be. <comment189380> I got "MIN One" at Identifont and another one with my screenshot at Whatthefont, which didn't fit at all. Not only not monospaced "Leger" is a modern font while the "verbose boot font" is more a classical font. Especially check the "Leger" lowercase a,b,d,m,n,p,q,r... None of them has a stem/serif. And the "Leger" 0 has no dot inside... <comment292331> Welcome to Ask Different!  Please refrain from adding comments in the Answer section, this is for answers to the questions.
