Quicksilver accessible script for disabling and enabling Time Machine? <body> I'd like to disable and enable Time Machine at will via Quicksilver.  'nuff said.  Do you're thang, nerds. :)  <answer11178> Just realized I could copy it out of another script I use to detect displays.  Here they are:  Disable:  precodetell application "System Preferences" to activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "System Preferences"                 click menu item "Time Machine" of menu "View" of menu bar 1                 tell button "OFF" of window 1 to click         end tell     end tell tell application "System Preferences" to quit /code/pre  Enable:  precodetell application "System Preferences" to activate tell application "System Events"         tell process "System Preferences"                 click menu item "Time Machine" of menu "View" of menu bar 1                 tell button "ON" of window 1 to click         end tell end tell tell application "System Preferences" to quit /code/pre  Hope that helps someone else. If there's a better solution, I'm all ears!  <answer11179> You can also use this AppleScript to start a Time Machine backup:  precodedo shell script "/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper &amp;" /code/pre  or use a similar shell script.  I think Time Machine runs emway/em too often.  Instead, I leave Time Machine disabled and use Awaken to run this script twice daily.  <answer66517> I'm using TimeMachineEditor for modifying the schedule
