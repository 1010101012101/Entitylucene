OS X Messages.app, cmd+shift+w not working <body> On my new mac,   I have noticed in strongMessages.app/strong, I can no longer purge message threads via cmd+shift+w like I could on my old computer.  Every time I have to manually hit the "x" and delete them.   Update:  I am trying to strong"close the conversation"/strong not delete it.   Thoughts on how to fix this or add the binding?   <answer165039> If you mean delete Conversation.  Select the Conversation and use kbdcmd/kbd+kbd Delete /kbd keys  --update--  Looking at the helpshow shortcuts.  It is supposed to.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XcFni.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I do not see the menu option in mine.  <answer165052> I see what you mean. If you right-click on the conversation in the left-side of the conversation window (the circle user icons) you can choose "Close Conversation" instead of deleting the conversation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bW1P.png" alt="enter image description here"  I couldn't get the shortcut kbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdw/kbd to work until I went into preferences and and checked the box to "Save history when conversations are closed". Then I could close the conversation from the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pjEPC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hope this helps.  <comment193578> Updated my answer.  Not sure why some one has down voted this??? <comment193586> ok, I found that panel but for some reason that key command is not working to close the conversation.  any thoughts @markhunte on what would cause that? <comment193598> that was it, works great, thank you @edknittel
