Internet sharing via WiFi won't work (BSS stopping) <body> I'm trying to start internet sharing on my mac mini (share ethernet to wifi). Until a few days ago, it worked fine, and suddenly stopped working.  I'm pretty sure my "graphical" config is fine (with the System settings app). But there's something strange in the code/var/log/wifi.log/code.  Whenever I start the sharing, it actually works very briefly, before stopping again (MAC addresses and stuff replaced with code&lt;snip&gt;/code)  precode2014-05-05 11:47:37.974783 AM [wifid] &lt;en1&gt; Start BSS on &lt;snip&gt; 2014-05-05 11:47:37.974984 AM [wifid] &lt;en1&gt; Start Network 2014-05-05 11:47:38.058925 AM [wifid] &lt;en1&gt; Apple SWAP IE Raw IE:  &lt;snip&gt; Signature Length: 4 Use for Beacon Use for Probe Response  Host model identifier: Macmini6,2 Internet Connection Sharing Enabled  2014-05-05 11:47:38.107761 AM [wifid] &lt;en1&gt; Stop BSS on &lt;snip&gt; 2014-05-05 11:47:38.117333 AM [wifid] Change Interface Role on en1 with MAC &lt;snip&gt; to sta 2014-05-05 11:47:38.117608 AM [wifid] &lt;en1&gt; Maximum PHY Rate &lt;450&gt; /code/pre  Any idea what's wrong?  <answer135227> Had the same problem, reseting the NVRAM and PRAM worked for me.  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379  <comment151807> How about you disable your Snip.app (the screen snip) <comment151935> These snip were inserted by me to hide sensitive data, it has nothing to do with the Snip app (unless they do some funky stuff with the network, but I seriously doubt so...)
