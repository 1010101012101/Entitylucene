Dictation and Emoji not working <body> I am using OS X El Captain 10.11.6 (French edition).  For unknown reason, the function Start Dictation (Démarrer la dictée) et Emojis and Symbols (Emoji et Symboles) don't work anymore.  I followed the recommandation in this question:  Dictation just stopped working. But, nothing works.  I have just updated to 10.11.6. But, it's not better.  What can I do? How to reset the settings?  NOTE:  ul liThe microphone work (the bars are moving in de Preferences panel)./li liWhen I choose Start Dictation (or fn fn) nothing appends (no microphone picture)./li liWhen I choose Emojis and Symbols nothing appends too./li /ul
