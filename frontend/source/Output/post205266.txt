A contact is somehow synchronised with my MBPr <body> I have a MBPr.  Strangely, when I create a new Mail account - "Add Other Mail Account", I can see the field codeFull Name/code already filled with one of my iPhone's contact name:  precode    Full Name: John Email Address: &lt;empty&gt;      Password: &lt;empty&gt; /code/pre  I tried to change my contact name on my phone, and the value of the field has changed:  precode    Full Name: John123 Email Address: &lt;empty&gt;      Password: &lt;empty&gt; /code/pre  So this contact is somehow synchronised with my account. How can it be? I must have done a misconfiguration somewhere.  <comment247538> Silly question. Do you use iCloud? If so, what is in Internet Accounts preference pane? The account details could be coming from iCloud.
