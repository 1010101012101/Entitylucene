cd to a directory by typing its name? <body> For example if a directory 'blob' exists and I just type 'blob[return]' then the system codecd/codes into the blob directory for me.  In Linux (Ubuntu) I can add codeshopt -s autocd/code to my code.bashrc/code file, but on OS X this gives an error: code-bash: shopt: autocd: invalid shell option name/code  <answer55420> The output of codeshopt -p/code can be of some help here.  It prints a list of settable options.  Sadly, on Lion, codeautocd/code is emnot/em one of them (see excerpt below).    strongEdit/strong Lauri's answer above has a solution for updating your shell to include codeautocd/code  precode$ shopt -p shopt -u cdable_vars shopt -u cdspell shopt -u checkhash shopt -s checkwinsize shopt -s cmdhist shopt -u compat31 shopt -u dotglob shopt -u execfail shopt -s expand_aliases shopt -u extdebug shopt -u extglob shopt -s extquote shopt -u failglob shopt -s force_fignore shopt -u gnu_errfmt shopt -u histappend shopt -u histreedit shopt -u histverify shopt -s hostcomplete shopt -u huponexit shopt -s interactive_comments shopt -u lithist shopt -s login_shell shopt -u mailwarn shopt -u no_empty_cmd_completion shopt -u nocaseglob shopt -u nocasematch shopt -u nullglob shopt -s progcomp shopt -s promptvars shopt -u restricted_shell shopt -u shift_verbose shopt -s sourcepath shopt -u xpg_echo /code/pre  <answer55424> codeautocd/code was added in bash 4.0. You can install a newer version of bash with Homebrew and then change the default login shell with codechsh/code:  precodebrew install bash;echo /usr/local/bin/bash|sudo tee -a /etc/shells;chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  After you open a new login shell (or a tab by default in Terminal or iTerm 2), codeecho $BASH_VERSION/code should print something like code4.2.45(2)-release/code.  Terminal and iTerm 2 open new shells as login shells by default, so bash reads code~/.bash_profile/code but not code~/.bashrc/code. If you don't source code~/.bashrc/code from code~/.bash_profile/code or anything, add codeshopt -s autocd/code to code~/.bash_profile/code instead of code~/.bashrc/code.  <comment63619> Great answer. Bash 4 is also available in MacPorts:subbing  `sudo port install bash` into your step 1 works as well. <comment64188> I did the above.  I ended up with bash 4.2.29 and I made the changes to /etc/shells and did the cssh but no joy <comment64192> @MichaelDurrant I edited the answer. `bash -version` would be the first version on $PATH. Did you try `echo $BASH_VERSION`? <comment64270> it works if i run the command directly /usr/local/bin/bash - i get v4.2  but how do I make that my default shell for a new window? <comment64299> @MichaelDurrant Is your terminal application set to open with something like `/usr/bin/login` or `login -fp $USER` in the preferences? <comment64495> Accepted plus I added a screenprint of where to change that. <comment64505> Although it doesn't work in tmux and it also doesn't show my PS1 (?) prompt with directory and username <comment64510> @MichaelDurrant I removed the screenshot from the answer since both Terminal and iTerm 2 should default to opening a login shell. If the default shell is `/usr/bin/local/bash` without `--login`, `.bash_profile` isn't loaded. <comment131337> [unaccept] This doesn't work for a new mac I am setting up. <comment135139> Tried again to use newer bash but even running /usr/local/bin/bash and then `bash --version `says `3.2.51(1)` after a `brew install bash` saying `4.2.45 already installed` <comment135558> If `/bin` is before `/usr/local/bin` on the path, `bash --version` is like `/bin/bash --version`. Try `echo $BASH_VERSION` instead. Did you add `shopt -s autocd` to `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`? <comment360412> 2017 ran into this again.  And again got stuck on old version.  @user495470 removed my screeshot which would have really helped me.  I don't care what 'should' happen.  As is this answer leads me stuck every time I rediscover it.
