Parsing dates in Mavericks <body> I'm sure this used to be valid:  precode$ date -d"2013-10-12T09:23:28+0100" +%h usage: date [-jnu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ...         [-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format] /code/pre  But it seems not to be in Mavericks. Indeed, the example for parsing dates in codeman date/code also doesn't seem to work:  precode$ date -j -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "`date`" "+%s" Failed conversion of ``Thu 31 Oct 2013 21:05:29 GMT'' using format ``%a %b %d %T %Z %Y'' date: illegal time format usage: date [-jnu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ...         [-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format] /code/pre  Any ideas on a workaround?  <answer107842> Here are two date commands that work on Mavericks to convert/extract time from date strings:  precodemac:~ me$ date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d %T" "2013-10-12 09:23:28" +%s 1381584208 mac:~ me$ date -j -f "%Y/%m/%d %T" "2013/10/22 10:45:00" +%h Oct /code/pre  It's not entirely clear what you seek, but hopefully these workable examples bridge the gap for your needs.  <answer107913> -d has set the kernel's value for daylight saving time in OS X's date at least since 10.6. The first command worked for me with GNU date (where -d specifies a date string):  precode$ gdate -d"2013-10-12T09:23:28+0100" +%h Oct /code/pre  The second command worked with the date that comes with 10.9 when I used the en_US locale but not when I used the en_GB locale:  precode$ date -j -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "`date`" "+%s" 1383305706 $ date -j -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "`LC_TIME=en_GB date`" "+%s" Failed conversion of ``Fri  1 Nov 2013 14:09:17 EET'' using format ``%a %b %d %T %Z %Y'' date: illegal time format usage: date [-jnu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ...             [-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format] /code/pre  In OS X's date, -j disables attempting to set the date and -f specifies a format for parsing a date.  <comment126473> What output to you desire from your date command? <comment126485> Thanks. I was just looking to parse dates. These work, which is great, although I actually installed coreutils via homebrew and switched to gdate to resolve it. <comment126488> If you don't mind the install, gdate has some much nicer features so you can pick and choose your particular poison for each task.
