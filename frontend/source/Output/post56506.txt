Can't disable "Press the Option key five times to turn Mouse Keys on and off" <body> Apple lets users who occasionally want the use of Mouse Keys to enable/disable it by pressing Option (kbd⌥/kbd) five times. I use Maya, so I'm constantly using the Option key to manipulate the camera, and this usage often triggers Mouse Keys. Unfortunately, this disables the rest of my keyboard (see this Apple KB page) and I can't use other helpful shortcuts. I can of course disable it again, but it's annoying when I have to do it again and again.  I went to the appropriate place in System Preferences to disable this (Universal Access  Mouse &amp; Trackpad), but it's greyed out. I've done extensive searching and haven't found anyone with a similar problem.  Why is this happening, and how can I stop it?  <answer56542> Change the value of codeuseMouseKeysShortcutKeys/code to codeNO/code in 'com.apple.universalaccess.plist'. I believe you will find the files in code~/Library/Preferences//code. When you're done, don't forget to reboot ;)  Also, you can do this via Terminal by typing codedefaults write com.apple.universalaccess useMouseKeysShortcutKeys NO/code and pressing enter. You may need admin rights to do this.  <answer140658> timothy go to accessibility in system preferences and then mouse and track pad then click options and it is the first option  <answer217639> To disable mouse keys I went to system preferences  <answer268980> To avoid editing plist or avoid command line, you can still do it in the prefs menu.   Go to System Preferences  Accessibility Preferences  Mouse and Trackpad  Options  Press Option Key five times to toggle Mouse Keys" (1st option). strongYou have to uncheck "Ignore built-in trackpad when Mouse Keys is on", first./strong  <answer288987> There's indeed an option to disable that permanently  Step 0  Search for  "Mouse Keys" in spotlight  Step 1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMPaf.png" alt="step1"  Step 2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/exBkM.png" alt="step2"  <comment64892> I'm currently on a windows computer, and I don't remember the exact path, but could you post the contents of `com.apple.keyboard.plist` or `com.apple.universalaccess.plist` (or something similar; see note above)? I believe you will find the files in `~/Library/Preferences/`. <comment64906> Rooted around those a bit, here's what I found: com.apple.universalaccess.plist only contained one thing that could possibly be of any use, `useMouseKeysShortcutKeys`, a Boolean type set to YES. I attempted to disable this, but neither the System Preferences window nor the option key act like this had an effect. Nothing else has any potential at all. <comment64907> Also, I couldn't find the Keyboard plist. I assume it has some sort of alternate name...? <comment64909> I didn't know if it was keyboard or universalaccess. What do you mean by "disable"? Did you set the value to NO, or did you delete the line altogether? <comment64912> I set it to NO. <comment64913> Did you restart? <comment64921> Heh, whoops. Yeah, that'd do it. Heh. I'll try that later (when I can) and inform you of the result—in the meantime, submit that as an answer. <comment64932> @Matt It worked, thanks for reminding me of that simple step! <comment65000> No problem. Even the best of us need help sometimes ;) <comment165736> Maybe you can write it as steps rather than one line. <comment165761> "went to the appropriate place in System Preferences to disable this, … but it's greyed out." I no longer have the problem, so it's moot, but your answer doesn't address my question. <comment337859> Ahh, it was right under my nose the whole time!
