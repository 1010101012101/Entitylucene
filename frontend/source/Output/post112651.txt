Can't stream audio from OSX Mavericks to Apple TV <body> Lately, when I click in "Apple TV" (trying to select it as default sound output), OSX changes it back to "Internal Speakers".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X7q28.png" alt="sound settings"  <answer118251> Just had this problem myself, and this solution worked for me: Open a terminal and kill the audio driver, it will restart and everything should work straight away.  precodesudo kill `ps -ax | grep 'coreaudiod' | grep 'sbin' |awk '{print $1}'` /code/pre  <answer125035> much simpler command:  precodesudo pkill coreaudiod /code/pre  <answer132102> codesudo killall coreaudiod/code is easier.  <answer141678> Disable and enable wifi.  This avoids killing coreaudiod.  <comment138159> nice, thank you very much! <comment140578> Would you know how to create a scriptfile with this command, and also how to supply my password in the command? It ask for my password when using it in terminal. Thanks
