OSX equivalent for ~/bin in Linux <body> When using Ubuntu I can save shell scripts in ~/bin. To launch them I just type the name of the script in the Terminal.  Is there an equivalent solution for OSX?  <answer92625> There is none by default in OSX.  But you can make a ~/bin folder, then edit your ~/.profile and add  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/Users/Yourname/bin /code/pre  (Yourname of course being replaced by your username).  or (edited later according to below comment)  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:~/bin /code/pre  <comment108639> You don't need to hardcode your username: `PATH=$PATH:~/bin` <comment108643> In addition you can hide that folder in the finder by using the `SetFile` command. `SetFile -a V ~/bin`. I do that as a personal preference. <comment108644> Thank you, it's working perfectly. <comment108817> Glad to hear :-) <comment134764> FYI, to create the '.bin' folder, use the "make directory" command: `mkdir bin` To list it: `ls -a` If you make a mistake, delete the folder by using "remove directory" command: `rmdir`
