Single-button shortcut for "Do not Disturb" <body> Is there a way I can bind a single key on my keyboard to toggle "Do not Disturb"?  It would be more convenient that opening up the notification center and moving that awkward slider.  I do think that you can bind a key to a script, so a command line option for "Do not Disturb" would work as well, so if there is a command-line tool to enable/disable "Do not Disturb" then I will take that as an answer (since I am muy familiar with bash and applescript).  <answer216099> Sure. Download the ruby script from https://gist.github.com/samnung/c7e767167cf70531ccdc and then just make a bash wrapper to call it.  precodedo_not_disturb.rb on /code/pre  You'll may want a tool like FastScripts to call the script (and if so, place your bash calling script in ~/Library/Scripts for it to show up there nicely)  <answer225119> Hold down the Option key and click on the Notifications icon in the menu bar.  <comment261101> Here is a ruby script that needs you to pass an "on/off" but it uses the correct manner of applescript simulating the mouse actions. Just writing to the plist using bash directly doesn't do everything the UI does on 10.11, so I don't use `defaults write` to make this change directly anymore - https://gist.github.com/samnung/c7e767167cf70531ccdc <comment261102> Sweet this is awesome.  Thanks! <comment261103> And it runs from the command line just fine, so I'll throw it in as a bind. <comment273172> That's great, but I'm looking for a single key to do this without the mouse. <comment273231> Go to System PreferencesKeyboard and select Mission Control. Tick the Do Not Disturb On/Off box then add your own button combination. Mine is Control Shift D. Granted its not a single button shortcut, but you don't have to load a script or anything for it. <comment273283> Thanks!  ^ This one actually worked very very well.  In fact, it worked better than the other answer. <comment273284> Adding it as a bind was difficult, and that didn't work well so I just tossed the idea.  @simon 's answer worked well.
