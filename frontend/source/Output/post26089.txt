Display is set to Mobile PC Display on Windows when I run it on  Macbook Pro via boot camp <body> Just installed Windows using boot camp. I downloaded the drivers using boot camp. After installing the display says: Mobile PC Display. I have 15 inch Macbook Pro.  What display driver do I need to get the right resolution?  strongUpdate:/strong Okay. My bad. Went to Genius bar at apple they told me that Mobile PC Display is how Macbook sees your display on Windows. Resolution is 1440 x 900 what my resolution on Macbook. There is no missing driver after all.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hIvj6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer26114> Your MacBook has a AMD Radeon HD 6490M video card per your properties screen. You'll need to download the driver from AMD's website.  strongFor Windows 7:/strong  ul li64 bit: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonmob_win7-64.aspx/li li32 bit: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonmob_win7-32.aspx/li /ul  For your display driver you might need to update your Bootcamp drivers which you can get from Apple's Boot Camp Support Drivers.  <comment29767> Do I install this when running Windows or OS X? When I try to install it on Windows AMD installer tells me "AMD Catalyst Mobility cannot be downloaded due to incompatible hardware/software on your computer.  Your computer does not contain proper graphics adapter." <comment29769> I'd try running the Boot Camp update first if you haven't, that _might_ fix the compatibility problem with the AMD driver. <comment29775> What do you mean by Boot Camp update? I've tried to see if there is some update button on boot camp assistant but there isn't. When I click on apple software updates it doesn't display any items for boot camp. It looks like I have most up to date boot camp version 4.0 <comment29828> Okay. My bad. Went to Genius bar at apple they told me that Mobile PC Display is how Macbook sees your display on Windows. Resolution is 1440 x 900 what my Macbook is configured for.
