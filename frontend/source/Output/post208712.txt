Is there any way to block automatic IOS updates? <body> I know my personal devices (iPhone / iPad) wont install updates automatically but it is downloading them automatically even with the settings turned off. What can I do to prevent automatic downloads of these updates so I can conserve my data usage?   <answer208751> Google-fu would seem to think the only way is to keep your device too full to take the download.br You can prevent it from downloading over 'mobile data' but not if it can see WiFi.  To prevent mobile downloads, go to Settings  App &amp; iTunes Stores &amp; disable the Use Mobile Data option.br The specific types above are to prevent the phone downloading other data types at all - meaning you will need to update via iTunes on your computer.    None of those options will prevent an iOS update from downloading [even Updates, which you may think would be the one] but the Mobile option will prevent it using your phone's data plan.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Juo8I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210299> If you're open to jailbreaking your devices to achieve this, there are some tweaks you can install that will help. On my iPhone 5 running iOS 8.4, I have Mikoto installed, and among its smorgasbord of features includes disabling the OTA software update abilities included in iOS, which will prevent downloading of future firmware files. In my experience, it's worked great so far.
