Change "From" address to new domain for Mail 7.2 (Mavericks) <body> I've recently purchased a domain and set up a forwarding email account there. This account forwards mail sent to it to my iCloud address.  I'd like to have the "From" line in outgoing emails from the iCloud account contain this forwarding email account such that replies to the message will direct to that address, rather than iCloud.  Is this possible? I've tried just setting a new alias, but Mail seems to have a problem with the new domain (i.e. that it's not a code@icloud.com/code) since there's no corresponding actual account for it (again, it's just a forwarding address). Setting up a custom IMAP account doesn't seem to work, since the forwarding account isn't a fully fledged email account.
