How to use several languages with the built-in dictionary without changing the interface language? <body> I'm frequently reading texts in english and french on my iPad. I really don't mind if the language of the interface is english or french. Is there a way to look up words independently of the interface language ? So far I'm switching the language in the settings when I need to.   This  is basically this question: Multiple languages for dictionary Look up in Spotlight, but for iPad.  <answer100804> strongOn iOS7:/strong the dictionary can be selected from the definition screen.  strongOn iOS6:/strong From my experience, switching the keyboard language is enough to change the dictionary language.   First you'll have to add the keyboards you need (this is a one-time operation):   ol liGo to Settings - General - Keyboard - Keyboards - Add New Keyboard. /li liSelect all the languages you're interested in./li /ol  Now you can use the key that is located to the left of the space bar in order to use a different keyboard (a list is displayed on long press).
