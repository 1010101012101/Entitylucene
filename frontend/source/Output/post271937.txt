USB keyboard, unaffected by settings, repeating keys when held together <body> emKey Repeat/em and emDelay Until Repeat/em settings work fine and are immediately applied for the MacBook keyboard in emTextEdit/em, but have no effect on the USB keyboard - even after reboot.  If I hold emhi/em, the result is emhhi/em via the USB keyboard. Further, if I hold emhit/em, the result is emhhihit/em.  Another example, if I hold emca/em, the result is emcac/em via the USB keyboard. Further, if I hold emcat/em, the result is emcactac/em. So different keys seems to give different behavior.  Any idea how to disable the repeating letters upon holding on the USB keyboard? Since it makes it difficult to type quickly. Also a bonus would be to have the keyboard settings applied to the USB keyboard.  ul liTeckNet Kraken LED Illuminated Gaming Keyboard/li limacOS Sierra 10.12.3/li liMacbBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011)/li /ul  <answer274179> Thank you to @tom-gewecke's suggestion! Trying a different keyboard worked, functioning normally without this issue.  So it seems to be a compatibility issue between the aforementioned keyboard and OS, possibly other versions of both.  <comment341995> Are you able to test this with a more standard usb keyboard to see whether it has the same behavior as your gaming keyboard? <comment344624> Finally got hold of a neighbours' old sticky keyboard (ES) loaded with dog hairs even after cleaning - functions normally w/o this issue! Thank you for the suggestion.
