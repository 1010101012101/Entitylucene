Automator rename finder item date and time <body> I want to use automator to create a project folder with a Automator service, but i like to add the month and year (with two decimals) not the day, month and whole year.   want i can creatie is item_29022014 but i like to create a file named: 'item_0214' where the first two numbers (02) are the month and the last two numbers (14) are the last to numbers of the current year(2014).   Can i download some add-on for automator? Or do i need a custom script for this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PoHs1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer120942> Check the answer found here  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52535/clean-up-file-names-using-automator  I changed the bash script code to include the date code.  precodeshopt -s extglob dcode=`date '+%m%y'` for f in "$@"; do    f1="${f%.*}"    f2="${f##*.}"    if [ "$f2" == "$f1" ] ; then             echo "$f" "${f1}_${dcode}"    else        echo "$f" "${f1}_${dcode}.${f2}"    fi done /code/pre  The code will should work even with files that do not have extensions.   Replace the commands echo with mv to actually get the code to do anything.  Hope that helped.  <comment140972> I am confused, try again. Is that a part of file name? <comment140973> i cant explain my self better then this. <comment140975> great job, it is clear now.
