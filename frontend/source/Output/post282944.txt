I need to delete a game app data from iCloud but not my iPad <body> I have a game where a glitch in the system has caused the Game Centre data in iCloud to be out of sync with the game on my iPad.  I want to delete the iCloud data and then reconnect the game so it then loads the data from the existing progress in the iPad back to iCloud / Game Centre - any ideas.  strongPlease do not post on tips how to delete the app from the iPad./strong  <answer283001> If the data is backed up on iCloud. You can manage the storage on your Mac.  System Preferences - iCloud - Manage Storage - Select the Backed Up Game - "Delete Documents and Data"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/riSYy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment356636> Related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/228407/deleting-app-data-from-game-center?rq=1, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25371/how-do-i-delete-data-for-one-game-in-the-ipad-game-center?rq=1 <comment356637> Possible duplicate of [Deleting app data from Game Center](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/228407/deleting-app-data-from-game-center) <comment356657> Possible duplicate of [How do I delete data for one game in the iPad Game Center?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25371/how-do-i-delete-data-for-one-game-in-the-ipad-game-center)
