Workspaces not switching automatically <body> Despite the fact that I have told mission control under 10.8 to spaces when switching applications(to the key window), it does not appear to work.  In fact the only time spaces works is when I tell it to switch using keyboard shortcuts. This started happening only once I unchecked show dashboard as space.  The following symptoms also occur: -Checking "show dashboard as space" does not re-enable dashboard -Dragging windows to the side of the screen does not cause spaces to switch -Keyboard shortcuts for mission control do not invoke mission control.  Mac OS 10.8  <answer129579> I don't think this is a 10.8 specific issue as I experienced the same thing on 10.9.2 when switching out of an application running full-screen.  My suspicion is that somehow the spaces plist files get corrupted.  My problem was fixed by regenerating the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spaces.plist file:  ol liNavigate to your user's Library folder.  This folder is hidden by default, but you can get there by holding down the option key when you click the Go menu in Finder and selecting Library./li liOpen the Preferences folder./li liMove com.apple.spaces.plist to the desktop.  There might be more than one, so drag them all out./li liLog out and log back in./li /ol  <answer195252> I've seen this intermittently for a few releases now. I fix it by restarting the "Dock" process (which handles Spaces/MissionControl) using this Terminal command:  strongkillall Dock/strong  I don't know how to do that via the regular GUI, sorry. And before you run that command, do strongkillall -s Dock/strong to see the processes which will get killed. If only the one "Dock" process is listed then you're good to go.  Hope this helps!  <answer225294> I was also having this problem on mavericks (osx 10.9.5). Here's how I solved it:  ol liIn Finder, click Go-Go to Folder.../li liType: '~/Library/Preferences/' and click Go./li liOpen the file 'com.apple.dock.plist' using a text editor./li liEdit the bottom line to: 'workspaces-auto-swoosh = ":true";'./li liRestart./li /ol  Cheers!  <answer293032> I find the issue sometime appears when I change the connected screens whilst the laptop is in sleep mode.  Restarting "Dock" works fine for me.   To restart "Dock" via GUI:  ol liHit "command + space" to bring up spotlight search./li liType "Activity Monitor" an hit "Enter"/li liSearch for "Dock" in the top-right search field in the Activity Monitor/li liDouble click on "Dock", press "Quit" and confirm "Quit"/li /ol  "Dock" will be automatically restarted by the system.  <comment342228> This should be the accepted answer. <comment369817> Well this only fixed my issue temporarily, @Troyen 's answer fixed the problem permanently.
