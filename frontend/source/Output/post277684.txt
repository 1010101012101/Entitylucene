What does the amber light on the AirPods case mean when AirPods are not in the case? <body> When I take the AirPods out of their case sometimes the case light changes color from orange to green or vice versa. I know the amber light means it is either charging or needs a charge. Is it associated with a particular battery percentage?  <answer277685> Apple's support article for AirPods doesn't point to an exact percentage but rather if the case can fully charge the AirPods.     If your AirPods are in your case, then the light shows the charge   status of your AirPods. If not, the light shows the status of your   case. Green means charged, and amber means less than one full charge   remains. If the light flashes white, your AirPods are ready to set up   with one of your devices. If the light flashes amber, you might need   to set up your AirPods again.   <answer294567> strongAmber/strong in an empty case means that the case doesn't have enough battery to fully charge a drained pair of AirPods.  hr  h1(# AirPods in Case)/h1  ul li(2) if both fully charged strongGreen/strong else strongAmber/strong/li li(1) if AirPod (in case) fully charged strongGreen/strong else strongAmber/strong/li li(0) if case has capacity for a full charge of drained AirPods strongGreen/strong else strongAmber/strong/li /ul  hr  h1Case changing color example:/h1  strongAmber/strong â†’ strongGreen/strong when removing uncharged AirPods from charged case  <comment371828> @JBallin I'd love a video to disprove Apple's support docs if you have a chance. <comment371830> This is not true according to Apple's docs (see my answer) and in my testing. I opened the case without AirPods next to my phone to see charge status. The light is green and the case shows 92% charged. <comment371981> This answer has been updated to be correct since Steve's comment.
