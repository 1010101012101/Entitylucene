How to transfer file (PDF) from imac to iphone when no internet <body> Does anyone know of any software that will allow me to send a pdf from my iMac to iPhone 5 when I have no internet please?  <answer174379> You could always set up a local network on your mac. Then you can use Dysoft's Download Manager, it has a buit-in ftp/http server you can locally connect to.  It also supports transferring files through iTunes, using the Apps tab (Device  Apps  Bottom of the page: "file transfer").  There are probably a lot of other apps that can do this, but I use this one and never had any trouble.  <answer174382> You could transfer it through iTunes, add it to the iBooks tab..sync..  Then you can open it through the iBooks app on your iPhone
