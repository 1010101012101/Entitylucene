Services shortcut not working properly <body> So I have set kbdctrl/kbd+kbdT/kbd to open the folder I have selected in Terminal. But usually it doesn't work and nothing happens entering the shortcut.  When I go Finder-Services and then don't press anything and go back to the Finder window, then it works. Seem's like some settings get reloaded then.  Any good clue how to fix this?   <comment269906> Are you sure that the terminal is not capturing the ctrl-T?? <comment269911> I'm in finder. Move up by one folder with cmd+up. Select folder Press ctrl+T. Then nothing happens. <comment270167> Confirmed, ctrl/T doesn't work, neither does ctrl/shift/T [though at least that beeps] or many other alternatives. Cmd/alt/shift/T does, though.
