Disable OS X feature to reopen windows at login time <body> In Mac OS X Lion, when I do Apple  Shut Down, there is a checkbox that says "Reopen windows when logging back in".   Even though I constantly UNCHECK the box, it seems OS X doesn't care - and still opens some Finder windows and sometimes Chrome...  How can I turn this feature off?  <answer21158> Do you ever want applications to restore to their closed state, or just at startup? If you want something resembling pre-Lion behavior (i.e. not picking up where you left off), try this.  Back up your system before trying this, in case it messes anything up, but I'd recommend this procedure: In the Finder, press Command-shift-G for "Go to the folder:" then type "~/Library/Saved Application State/" (without the quotes). Delete all the folders in Saved Application State, then press Command-I to Get File Info. In the Get File Info window, check the "locked" box. This should keep applications from restoring their state.  <answer21319> Be sure that Google Chrome isn't included in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Items.    Also, Finder windows restore by default regardless, as they did in Snow Leopard.  <answer34560> This bug has been fixed with the strongLion update 10.7.4/strong:     h3The OS X Lion v10.7.4 Update includes fixes that:/h3      Resolve an issue in which the "Reopen windows when logging back in"   setting is always enabled.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWGZ0.png" alt="enter image description here"  (click here for more information)  <answer44903> For the record, we’re talking about this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JN44A.png" alt="Screenshot"  The problem is that OS X doesn’t remember if you uncheck the checkbox on the last shutdown — it will always keep the checkbox checked by default on subsequent shutdowns.  I found two different solutions for this problem, that seem to do the trick, although they aren’t ideal.  Open Terminal.app and enter the following commands:  precodedefaults write com.apple.loginwindow TALLogoutSavesState -bool false defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowLaunchesRelaunchApps -bool false /code/pre  This effectively disables the “reopen windows when logging back in” option, although the checkbox will still appear to be checked. You can just ignore it.  I’m afraid there’s no better solution, at least not at the moment.  hr  strongUpdate:/strong OS X 10.7.4 fixed this — it now remembers your selection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YP5g3.png" alt=""  <comment22725> In System Preferences  Users & Groups  Login Items, is Chrome set to open at login?  In Snow Leopard, I know Finder windows were restored at launch, but Chrome windows are a mystery. <comment23295> You were right about Chrome, it was in the login items, I don't know how it got there... <comment23350> I added that as an answer so you can mark your question as successfully answered. <comment23674> Perhaps is our old friend GoogleSoftwareUpdate ? I bet Chromium does not do that .... :\ <comment51394> It seems Mountain Lion fixed the issue <comment51395> @nute So does Mountain Lion remember your selection, or does it respect and remember the `TALLogoutSavesState` setting? It’s a neat improvement either way! <comment52252> It remembers my checkbox selection. <comment52286> @nute Awesome, thanks for the info! <comment58332> Unchecking "Reopen windows when logging back in" really just disables reopening *applications*. When applications are reopened either manually or as login items, their state is still restored. (Even if Resume was disabled in the General preferences and application state wouldn't normally be restored.) <comment58333> Two related questions: [Unchecking "Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps" doesn't work](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/39555/unchecking-restore-windows-when-quitting-and-re-opening-apps-doesnt-work), [Uncheck "Reopen windows when logging back in" by default](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24783/uncheck-reopen-windows-when-logging-back-in-by-default) <comment58716> This hack resulted in some graphical glitches on my MBP 8-2 every time I logged in!
