Save calendar invite emails after accept? <body> I have an issue that when I accept a calendar invite it will delete the email from my messages. It's not in deleted, inbox, or anything. It's simply gone it seems but I could be missing where it saves them. Sometimes people don't include all the vital information in the actual event and instead put it in the email they send the invite with.  This presents the issue of not having the info in the calendar but also not able to retrieve it from your messages. Is there a setting I'm missing? How do I get it to save the invite email even after accepting?
