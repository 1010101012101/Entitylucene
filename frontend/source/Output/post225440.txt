Terminal: “Invalid Argument: dirname” (El Capitan) <body> I noticed the issue when I first went to run  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES /code/pre  in OS X Terminal (10.11.2) but this was returned  precodebash: /usr/bin/defaults: Invalid argument /code/pre  I'm not sure what is going on with defaults, but I also have a similar issue with brew:  precode/bin/bash: /usr/bin/dirname: Invalid argument /code/pre  I clearly broke something (or perhaps malware), but not sure how I did it or when it happened. This is causing all sorts of issues. Any thoughts on fixing it?  My PATH variable looks like this:   precode/Users/username/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/texbin:/Users/username/.rvm/bin /code/pre  EDIT: I noticed my issue is similar to this one: OS X Yosemite Hard Disk Errors even after Repairing them but there's no resolution.   <answer230195> Found a solution! I reinstalled El Capitan from the recovery partition (hold command-R while restarting). The errors are now gone.  <comment273531> Please add your PATH (`echo $PATH`) and check your history file and `env` <comment273774> $PATH included above. <comment273791> What is your prompt? also try with a minimal path - i.e. remove PATH from your .bas* files <comment279194> How do I go about removing PATH from my .bas* files?
