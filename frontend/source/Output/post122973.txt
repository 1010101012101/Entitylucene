Numbers: Countif with condition the content of a cell <body> I am struggling to come with a solution on this problem, making me wonder if the Countif function is designed to work this way, or what is wrong with my syntax at the end.  I have my first table with the data and the second where I want to count data. In the second table I have columns with the "strings", which their appearance I want to count on my first table.  My formulas is the following:   precode=COUNTIF(table1 :: B5:B7;"=T(C9)") /code/pre  I have tried also   precode=COUNTIF(table1 :: B5:B7;"=C9") /code/pre  But I am getting syntax error. Can someone give some insight ?  <answer122993> Seems like you are using wrong argument in condition part of formula - meaning that you should put there string that you are looking for not the address of the cell because Numbers thinks that you are looking for string "C9" and not value from C9.  <answer123018> I managed to find the syntax that works, but I was not allowed to post the answer. It should look like this:   precode=COUNTIF(Table 1 :: B2:B337;"="&amp;T(A3)) /code/pre  <answer213817> precodesimply =COUNTIF(table1 :: B5:B7; C9 ) /code/pre  <comment143569> Hey thanks for the input: I managed to find the syntax that works, but I was not allowed to post the answer.
