Is it possible to remove/uninstall Quicktime Player 7? <body> Is it possible to remove/uninstall Quicktime Player 7?  I installed it back when my system was running Snow Leopard and now I'm on Mountain Lion I no longer need it but I can't see a way to remove it.  <answer58893> OS X seems to allow just moving it to the trash, which is probably the recommended way to remove it.  If you use an application like AppCleaner, check that it doesn't actually try to delete files for the new QuickTime Player:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PN5ER.png" alt=""  The bundle identifiers of the old and new version are codecom.apple.QuickTimePlayer/code and codecom.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/code. The only files it found for the old version were:  ul licode/Applications/Utilities/QuickTime Player 7.app//code/li licode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.quicktimeplayer.plist/code/li licode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.quicktimeplayer.plist.lockfile/code/li licode~/Library/Caches/com.apple.helpd/Generated/com.apple.QuickTimePlayer.help//code/li /ul  <comment67679> What happens if you drag it from the Applications folder to the Trash? (Back up your system first, in case you do, in fact need it!)
