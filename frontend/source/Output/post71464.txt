Audio Player with Gapless Playback <body> I'm looking for an (preferably free) audio player on OS X that supports gapless playback.  It doesn't need to be fancy, I don't need any bells and whistles.  I just want gapless playback.  Unfortunately VLC doesn't support this, and though I've tried about half a dozen other players, none of them seem to implement this, or if they do I don't know how to enable it. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I'd also like to avoid iTunes if at all possible since I organize my music by folder and the ID3 tags aren't necessarily up-to-date... and I generally hate iTunes.  <answer71906> There are multiple applications which can serve you these features. foobar2000 for starters and also Megaseg.  <answer73871> Vox | Cog  Both do gapless, Vox being the one I use.  <comment83488> What's foobar2000?
