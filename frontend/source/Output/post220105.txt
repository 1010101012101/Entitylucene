Finder copying dialog freezing from time to time during transfer <body> I'm trying to backup 2tb drive I have connected to my mac to another drive using this enclosure via firewire 800: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/M3QX2KIT0GB/ br/ br/The problem is that from time to time the copying dialog is freezing and not doing enything. During that time I can see my hard drive also I can se all the folder in root folder but when I open them, they are all empty. As soon as finder resume from that freezing stage I can access anything on that drive. br/br/ Some time the freezing las longer and I've got an error that a certain file was unable to be copied but when I searched for it and trying to copy it manually it worked. Du  During the freezing the hdd leds just said open without blinking. br/br/ I've tried DiskUtilty's First Aid (notice that I'm using El Captain) and everything seems ok.  br/ Tried also:     diskutil repairdisk /dev/diskx   but everything seems fine.  I Have also noticed a slow transfer rating. 2tb in more than 1 day.  Any Ideas why is that happening.  There are any other method to backup those files without finder?  <comment266348> You should be using the command-line `cp` command. `cp` bypasses all the Finder overhead and just moves the data. Using `cp` is recommended when moving thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of files/folders. <comment266362> could you give me a hint how to use it? <comment266369> `cp source destination`  Ex: `cp /Desktop/Folder_of_files /External_Drive/Folder_Destination`   The command `man cp` in Terminal will give you all the switches and options. [This page](http://www.macworld.com/article/2080814/master-the-command-line-copying-and-moving-files.html) gives some additional help. I suggest you experiment with the `cp` command to see how it works.
