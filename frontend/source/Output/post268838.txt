Safari 10.0.2 (macOS 10.12.2) not loading css on specific web pages <body> I've seen versions of this problem, but nothing this specific. I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, early 2011) running Sierra with Safari 10.0.2. Very specific websites will load without css. I removed extensions, flushed caches and histories, removed preferences, but those same websites persist without loading their css. qz.com is one, independent.co.uk, buzzfeed.com. I'll try to dig up others. Always these sites, always persistent, doesn't change on refresh, anything.
