Lost all my playlists with newest Version of iTunes 12.1.0.71 <body> I have just down loaded the newest version of iTunes (12.1.0.71)on my Laptop and lost all my playlists and CD's I burned....all that is left is the music I have purchased on iTunes over the past 8 years.  I called Apple support they said they were sorry but there is no way to recover your playlists.....can anyone help  <comment200817> is your library in a non-standard location? You might need to just reassociate it again. <comment202353> Apple seems to have bugged the playlist exports: the file location is only included with .XML, all other formats they offer for exporting and maintaining playlists have the file target field completely empty. Bug?
