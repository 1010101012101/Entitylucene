iOS Videos app crash <body> I just synced some TV-Episodes to my iPhone and now, I can't open the iOS videos app anymore. If I open it, I see just a white screen with the navigation bar at the top and the the tab bar at the bottom, both in white, without any text or images.    What do I have to do in order to get it working again?    Info:br When I open the app and press the home button when the white screen appeared, the app closes and opens immediately again.br I can't enter multitasking when the crashed app is in foreground, I have to close the app by pressing the home button and then I can enter multitasking.br I'm using an iPhone 4S, iOS 7.1  <comment150099> Have you tried closing the app? I mean... force-quitting it? http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5137 <comment150104> @RonaldPoi Yes, not working. Updated my answer
