Can not setup open directory due to host name <body> In activing Open Directory on a new install of OS X, I am able to put in a diradmin name/password, and they I get the following dialog:  precodeThis computer's host name is invalid.  The host name does not resolve to any configured address of this computer.  Please ensure the host name is correct. /code/pre  I have checked  precodescutil --get ComputerName scutil --get HostName scutil --get LocalHostName /code/pre  Each has returned what I expected (the machine name...the domain we are on, and the LocalHostName which matches the ComputerName.  My goal is to restore a backup of a live OD server to this one along with passwords.  <answer252502> That "what I expected" part seems wrong.   precodeLocalHostName + &lt;your domain name&gt; should equal HostName /code/pre  so, if HostName is myserver and your domain is sample.com than LocalHostName should be "myserver" and HostName should be  "myserver.sample.com".  In a terminal,   precodedig `scutil --get HostName`  /code/pre  should return the IP adress of your server.
