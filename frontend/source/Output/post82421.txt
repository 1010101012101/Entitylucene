Mac shuts down automatically <body> Hi I am using MacBook 2008 model.  I've installed Win XP using Bootcamp.  For past few weeks I notice that when running Win XP, after few minutes (approx 15 to 20 mins), laptop gets shutdown automatically.  This does not happens when running OS X.  Any Suggestions...??  <answer82597> If the fans are running fast it's an overheating issue. Otherwise the windows battery related drivers might have a hard time detecting your battery state.  <comment95102> My best guess is that Windows is crashing. Try opening XP's logs and post them here. <comment188479> This is a Diagnostic. Paste following in Terminal syslog -k Sender kernel -k Message CSeq 'n Cause: -' | tail | awk '/:/{$4=""; print}' | pbcopy  the result will be copied to your clipboard and tell us what is the reson for shut down.
