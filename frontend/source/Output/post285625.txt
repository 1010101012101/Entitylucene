iPhone5 drawing little current and not turning on <body> My fianc√©e has recently started to encounter problems with charging of her iPhone 5, it started to charge more and more slower.  I'm not very akin to iPhones so she went to local apple support and got battery and lightning connector replaced. Everything was good for one day, then it discharded completely again.  I took an amp meter and checked it against 4 chargers (one ,,official'') and two cables (both are some sort of ,,authorized'' replacements) , two macbooks and pc and here are my observations:   ul liWhen connected to ,,official charger'' it draws only 50mA (0.256W), no voltage drop /li liWhen connected to other chargers voltage drops to 4.6 to 4.7V and it draws 200 to 230 mA (about one watt) but it quickly starst dropping and stops drawing anything after 30minutes/li liSimilar with macs and pc /li /ul  In every case it detects that cable is plugged in, but is unable to do any kind of hard resetting.   So my question is whats the cause of such behaviour, because as i recon fresh LiPo battery should draw electricity like crazy.   Thanks for any information!
