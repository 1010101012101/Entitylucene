Check Macbook Pro Fan <body> I am having Macbook Retina(13 inches). How can I check whether laptop's fan is working or not?br Is there any way to start and stop the fan manually?  <answer283256> There are a few apps that are available to use as Fan Utilities - they will show you current speed, as well as allow you to enable the fans to full blast.    Here's one I have used previously:   https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23049/smcfancontrol  -- Ed  <answer283301> Personally I'm using iStat Menus:  https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wCxhk.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3XI3J.png" alt="enter image description here"  strong12 Alternatives to Macs Fan Control :/strong  http://www.topbestalternatives.com/macs-fan-control/  <comment357083> Welcome to Ask Different!

But I am getting the speed as 000rpm, none of the sound from the fan. <comment357085> Based on your comment on the answer, I'd try shutting down the computer and running Apple Hardware Test. It's possible you have a broken fan or a broken fan sensor. If AHT fails, it's time to take it in for service <comment357483> Thanks for the response. I tried. I think the problem because of the fan. At least, once have to go to Apple care center.
