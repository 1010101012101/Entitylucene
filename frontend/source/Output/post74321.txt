Is there a mac utility that can magnify parts of the screen? <body> For some teaching efforts, especially running through tutorials, I'd like to zoom in on parts of my screen to show a room-full of people small text from the projected screen. Is there an OS X utility that will magnify sections of the screen as I move my cursor over it? I know about strongOmniDazzle/strong but the magnifier is somewhat clunky.  <answer74323> Go to emSystem Preferences/em, then emAccessibility/em. There will be a column on the left for Zoom, which you can use a keyboard shortcut to activate.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Veip4m.png" alt="macOS Accessibility, Pictures"  Once activated, hitting kbd⌥/kbd-kbd⌘/kbd-kbd+/kbd will zoom the screen.  <answer74332> Digital Color Meter can do that but unfortunately AFAIK its window is not resizable.  <answer74356> You don't say which version of osx you are using, in 10.8.2 go to system preferences, accessibility, zoom, then under zoom style select picture-in-picture. The zoom box will follow your cursor. Older versions had this option not sure of the steps for other versions.  <answer206299> Try the following apps:  ul liZoom It/li liVirtual Magnifying Glass/li /ul  There are at least one other, but Zoom It app is the one that most reviews recommend. I use it with a 40 inch 4k display. Awesome!  <comment86337> You could also press control and scroll which will zoom in the *whole* screen. <comment86377> I'm on 10.8.2. Thanks for the suggestion. <comment86398> your welcome glad it helped
