iTunes "Recently Added" <body> Is there any way of customizing the "Recently Added" view of the iTunes Library? I would like to be able to specify a time range, as it used to be possible prior to iTunes 12.4.x. I'm thinking of some kind of hidden plist setting.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/1GtP13g.png"  I know one can create smart playlists with a "Date Added" field, but that's not what I'm looking for: when choosing "View as Albums", there's no "Sort by date added option", which is what I'd need to replicate the recently added view.  <answer244351> There is no way to change the default emRecently Added/em criteria.  As you already discovered, you can make a emSmart Playlist/em with a limited set of criteria, included strongDate Added/strong.  However, iTunes doesn't allow a sort by strongDate Added/strong when viewing as albums, unfortunately.
