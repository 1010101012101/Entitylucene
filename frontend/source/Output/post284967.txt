I suddenly cannot open any files in Script Editor.app <body> Today, I was working on an .scpt file in Script Editor.app, when, suddenly, Script Editor would not allow me to save the file. It was a seemingly random occurrence; I had not done something unique when the error surfaced. I had successfully saved this file in Script Editor dozens of times today.  I then emQuit/em Script Editor and double-clicked on the .scpt file in Finder, to open the file in Script Editor (which is my default application for .scpt files).  Script Editor responded with the following error dialog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lL1jO.png" alt="Error dialog"  It reads:     The document "My script.scpt" could not be opened.   I can launch Script Editor and I can create a emNew Document/em. But, I cannot open an existing document.  hr  What I've tried:  ul liRestarting and shutting down the computer/li liRunning "First Aid' in Disk Utility.app/li liOpening Script Editor.app via the right-click context menu in Finder/li liOpening a .scpt file via the menu bar in Script Editor (kbdFile/kbd → kbdOpen.../kbd)/li liOpening a .scpt file via the right-click context menu in Finder/li liCreating a new document in Script Editor that contains zero characters.

Then I would reboot and see if that fixes the problem. If that did not fix the problem, I would then go to /Users/your short name/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist. &lt;—- and delete that .plist file, then reboot and fire up the script editor app to see if the problem is fixed.  You may want to make a backup copy of that plist file before you delete It.  I'm not quite sure if that file is hidden in the system, So you may have to unhide hidden files before you can find that plist file  This is the script I use to show hidden files in the system...  precodedo shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\nkillall Finder" /code/pre  An alternate solution would be trying to restore that .plist file using Time Machine  <comment359406> I've already run "First Aid' in Disk Utility.app, as I mentioned. Can you explain what you mean by, _"run disk utility app"_? <comment359407> you already tried that solution… I posted that part of my answer without seeing the fact that you tried that already… Disk utility <comment359426> OK. Deleting the `com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist` file has allowed me to open .scpt files in Script Editor again. Thanks for the tip! But, a new issue has surfaced. I've detailed this issue in a new post: [*When using a third-party script library, I can no longer save an AppleScript file in Script Editor.app*](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/285037/when-using-a-third-party-script-library-i-can-no-longer-save-an-applescript-fil)
