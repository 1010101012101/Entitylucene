How to set keep touch on Mac touchpad? <body> I am rookie in Mac and I came from Ubuntu  On my previous Dell laptop if I needed to mark some part of text in order to copy or delete it I just made one short touch on touchpad and immediately second touch (not click) and second touch I keep my finger on touchpad and than I can just move mouse and mark text.  or for example how I deleted files:  I have a file on desktop I need to trash it. I put mouse on the file make one short touch and immediately second touch and keep touch on file and now I am able to move file to trash on somewhere on the desktop.  But with mac touchpad I need make click (not just touch) and keep click with one finger and another finger I can move the file somewhere I need. Just remember how you move you file on the desktop, you use two fingers for this.  I hope I describe my problem clearly but feel free to ask  Question is : if there is some settings how to change behavior of touch click?  <answer264303> It is a bit hidden, but it is possible:  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liClick on Accessibility/li liScroll down a bit and click on Mouse &amp; Trackpad/li liClick on Trackpad Optionsâ€¦/li liEnable dragging/li liSelect "three finger drag"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vdhib.png" alt="Screenshot of System Preferences"/li /ol  <comment331157> System Preferences  TrackPad  More Gestures...
