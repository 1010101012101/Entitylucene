How to change Font size for PDF in iPad running iOS 9? <body> I have iPad mini 2 running iOS 9. I'm transferring my PDFs to the iPad via iTunes.  I swear that I didn't find any option to increase font size in iBooks, not even in iBooks settings.  <answer243442> I don't think it's possible. I can't find any way to adjust font size on PDFs using iBooks for iOS, nor can I find anything about it online. Apparently, one can only adjust the font size with books in iBooks and not PDFs.
