Backing up a disk image with Time Machine <body> I'm storing backup of my Gmail account in a disk image, to cut on number of files on the main HFS+ volume. This makes Time Machine ignore the existence of this volume, just because it's in a disk image.  Is it possible to get Time Machine to treat the disk image as a regular disk, and get Time Machine to back it up as if it were a "physical" volume?  This is on Mountain Lion 10.8.2, on late 2009 white unibody Macbook.  <answer125662> To back up a disk image, you back up the code.dmg/codefile itself, instead of the virtual disk the system shows you.   However, unless the disk image is a sparse bundle image. Time machine will have to backup the entire disk every time the disk changes.   <comment81513> You canâ€™t back it up as a physical volume, it will back up as a dmg file. Not sure, really. <comment82216> I was asking precisely because I'm interested if I can force Time Machine to treat this volume as a physical one. I'm only separating it to make HFS+ happier and snappier. <comment201998> Can this be done while the disk image is mounted? If so, how does it avoid problems with the image being modified during the back up process?
