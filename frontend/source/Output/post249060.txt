Transfering PDFs to ipad on windows? <body> I got about 300 PDFs which I need to transfer to my iPad Mini 2 but when I press the add folder to library in iTunes on windows I am unable to get the PDF's on, I only get the .epub files up... Any idea's on how to do this without having to add them one by one? (Yes I am a book freak :P)  <answer249089> The solution was to press "Add file to library" and shift-click to select all the books... Weird that iTunes can't add PDFs with "Add folder to library".  <comment308824> Have you tried iTunes? <comment308832> @CousinCocaine I wrote "when I press the add folder to library in ITUNES on windows...". Yes I have tried itunes but it doesn't add PDF's into library, only epub. I can add PDFs separately ONE by ONE and I got another 200 books to add on another ipad... which just takes too much time. <comment308841> Give Goodreader a try <comment308842> I need an app that I can add both PDFs and epub files to, to have all books in the same place... <comment308843> Apple's own iBooks can handle both... <comment308844> I know that was what I used before but I am unable to add both PDFs and epub files to my iPad's iBooks via iTunes because iTunes only select epub <comment308846> Strange, that is not normal behaviour. Doe you have enough storage left? Incompatible filenames? You can try GoodReader/Dropbox/etc to import to iPad, then transfer between apps.
