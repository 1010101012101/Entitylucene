Mac slow after clean install, what should I do? <body> My mac was so painful slow so I had to do clean install but the problem still.  Obs: I have one Macbook pro 13' 2012 with i5 and 4gb of ram.   Edit: After the install took 12 hours, the problem still here's the log  Edit: Safe mode on don't stop this errors  Edit: I did a clean install, because I am a developer and I need my mac 100%, but when I open any app take minutes to open, the worst its finder and spotlight, I dont know what could happen to him... ): Installing the yosemite again take 9 hours or more, I am thinking in sell it and take one windows, this problem upset me.  precode13/05/15 09:09:56,121 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.watchdogd) Service only ran for 1 seconds.

Open the iCloud pane in System Preferences and uncheck the box marked iCloud Drive.   You'll be warned that your iCloud documents will be deleted. -Confirm.   They won't be deleted from the server.   Check the box again and test.  <comment220831> I changed the log, I am in safe mode, please look at this. <comment221466> What was the problem that made you do the clean install?  If simply 'painful slow':  How much pain?  How bad is the problem right now?  Please feel free to post longer responses in your native language and I will try to translate. <comment221507> I tried to explain (: <comment235036> Do you only have the problem after booting up or is the actual booting also very slow?
