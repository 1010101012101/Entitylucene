Mail app correctly marks spam but does not move it to the junk mail folder <body> as by message, Mail app does not bother moving mail correctly marked as spam in the spam folder -- this only happen when I am at home, and only during the week-end.  I suspect that the IMAP server is to be blamed.  I could try to delete the account and recreate it, but since it's my work email, and the server is showing some problems, I am quite lukewarm about this solution (Mail app problem in Lion).  Is there another less drastic way of solving the problem?  I'm on OS 10.8.3 all latest whistles and bells.  <answer94109> ol liYou need open the preferences window (command + ,)/li liClick on Junk Mail pane/li liSelect: "Move it to the Junk mailbox (Automatic)"/li /ol
