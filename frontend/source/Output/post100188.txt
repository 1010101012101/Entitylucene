OSX 10.8 - How to keep a custom dock for all users that login <body> I have an iMac with OSX 10.8, joined to a work domain. I want to get create a custom dock and save it so all users will see my custom dock when they log in. I've done some Google searches and everything seems to point to these steps:  ol liCreate dock how you want it/li liCopy ~/library/preferences/com.apple.dock.plist to /system/library/user\ template/english.lproj/library/preferences/li /ol  I've done this and then logged in as a new user, but am seeing a different dock than I created. I've also tried copying com.apple.dock.db to English.lproj/library/preferences as well, but to no avail.  The new users that will be logging in are network accounts.  Am I missing something?  <answer100289> Dug up my notes from when I first modified the user template in our base images.  Ran back through the process, changing the default Dock to have about 15 items, on a fresh Mac and these steps worked.  I did a lot of this from the command line, so as to not fuss with changing/reverting permissions using Finder.  ol liArrange your Dock however you would like for it to appear on new user accounts, changing the orientation and adding/removing applications./li liBrowse to strong~/Library/Preferences/strong and copy the strongcom.apple.Dock.plist/strong file to your desktop./li liOpen Terminal and start a root session by typing: codesudo -s/code/li liEnter your current account's password when prompted/li liCopy the copy of your modified dock preference file from your desktop to the User Template in your Mac's System folder.: codecp ~/Desktop/com.apple.Dock.plist /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/Preferences/code/li /ol  That should do the trick.  I tested this on a fresh Mac by logging into both a Guest account and a new (emcreated after the above steps/em) standard user account, both accounts showed the proper Dock with 15~ items.  It shouldn't be necessary with these steps but if you run into trouble you should verify that the strong/System/Library/User Template/strong folder has permissions set to: emSystem - Read/Write/em &amp; emEveryone - No access/em.  <comment117903> Those appear to be the same steps I took when adding the custom dock (removed iCal, AddressBook, etc from dock) to the user template in the image I use for new Macs at work.  When the users, Active Directory authenticated network users, login they are presented with the custom dock, as are Guest users.  Have you checked to ensure the permissions are the same as they initially were for the user template folder? System should have read/write access, everyone should have no access. <comment118029> I gave the /system/library/user\ template directory the access rwxrw----. It previously was rwx------. I then copied over com.apple.dock.plist, tried logging in as a new user, and the dock still is different from the custom one I created. <comment118042> Just added my notes from when I first did this a while back and verified they still worked on a 10.8.4 Mac.  Hopefully they work for you. <comment118177> I followed your steps and also copied the .plist file to ../English.lproj/Library/Preferences as well, but the issue still remains. <comment118183> Actually, I just tried these steps again on a brand new iMac, just out of the box. I did these steps before I added it to the domain, and now new network users that log in are seeing the custom dock I made. Any ideas on why it won't work with the other iMacs? <comment118196> @JoeyBaud That's strange.  I would think that the system would simply pull from the User Template file whenever it creates a new user.  It almost sounds like the system makes a cache of the User Template once it's joined to the domain.  I'm afraid I don't know for sure though. <comment119313> I found out that the dock settings were being set via OD. Copying the plist there should fix the problem. <comment119692> @JoeyBaud Ah, that will do it! <comment251522> The steps above work, with caveats: 1. The actual path for the required Prefs folder in 10.9 is /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/Library/Preferences/ 2. Mavericks adds a dock icon for iBooks and the Downloads folder as part of the user creation script, so these are added even if you have removed them from your custom dock. If you already have a Downloads icon, it will add a second one, so remove them both from your custom design. <comment251523> I can confirm this works on 10.11, so long as you use /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/Library/Preferences/ Thanks for the useful tip!
