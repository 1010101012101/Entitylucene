Cannot hear live audio from USB guitar in GarageBand <body> I plugged guitar via USB external audio card U24XL to Mac OS X Yosemite. But I can't hear any sound of it in GarageBand. I set up input/output in GB's preferences, and marked the current (guitar) track for monitoring, but no sound of guitar is listenable, nor recordable.  Output is correct as I can hear a drum track. The audio card works fine because I can monitor raw guitar sound via a tiny utility codeLineIn/code (I can record it in codeAudition/code also).  Any idea?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bP9KU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment299780> Your image shows "U24XL with SPDIF I/O" for GarageBand's Input Device selection. Is there an option that doesn't mention SPDIF? I'm not familiar with the U24XL, but I've looked at a picture, and I suspect SPDIF is the optical connections, not the analog jacks. <comment300122> There are two inputs (spdif and analog) in that card. But I think it's just a title for the card. Anyway there is just one output in it.
