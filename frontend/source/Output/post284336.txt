Create wifi hotspot on macbook pro 2015 model <body> I have setup a Plex server on my MacBook Pro. Currently I have a poor-performing router (which I will be replacing soon). In the mean time I am trying to create a wifi hotspot on my MBP and connect my TV directly to it over wifi to be able to stream high bit rate media smoothly.   I tried the option codeCreate network/code but it's not showing up on other devices. Sharing internet is not what I want; I just want them to be on same wifi network to stream local content.   I'm using a 2015 13" MacBook Pro with Sierra.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p2Qm8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment358583> https://www.howtogeek.com/214053/how-to-turn-your-mac-into-a-wi-fi-hotspot/ <comment358587> @Joonas Tried that as well, didn't work. Forgot to mention in the post.
