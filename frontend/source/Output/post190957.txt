Google Inbox Does Not Display My Contact Photo <body> When I send e-mails through my regular Gmail address, my contact photo appears. When I send e-mails through a third-party domain associated with my e-mail inbox, my contact photo does not appear.  I would like to set up Google Inbox to show my photo when I use my third-party e-mail address. This is basically the flip side of another question but I want to change things as the sender and not as the receiver.  <comment226793> I've linked this to the other answer. It's far better to link questions as opposed to answers. if the answers are similar or identical - so much the better, but they don't have to be so linking the questions is best. <comment227102> @bmike You actually mean that you have linked the answer to my question here instead of linked this to the other answer.
