Have not tried again since, would not know if post-release Yosemite fixes anything... but I doubt it. <comment200345> i have the same macbook and osx yosemite runs just fine, you might want to try upgrading. If you don't want to, try resetting the pram and nvram as described here:http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063 <comment200352> I spent days praying that PRAM/NVRAM resets would work, finding they wouldn't, removing GPU drivers to force alternate drivers, etc. etc. I'll give Yosemite a try at some point, I suppose... <comment200369> and a smc reset? http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 <comment200560> Of course. Hence the last-plea Stack Exchange post.
