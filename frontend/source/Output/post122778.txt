Unlocking an iPhone with iOS 7.0.4 using SAM (Subscriber Artificial Module) <body> I want to unlock my iPhone with a utility called SAM, or Subscriber Artificial Module.  I saved my activation ticket and used it to unlock my iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1.1.  A few days ago I replaced my old iPhone at an Apple Store an they gave me a new iPhone 4 with iOS 6.1.3.  I installed the update to iOS 7.0.4.  Is it possible to put my SAM activation ticket back on this new iPhone?   I have the original SIM card and the ticket which I have used when SAM came out in April 2013,  but I can't put it back on this new iPhone.  I'm wondering if I can use the SAM ticket and original SIM card in a different iPhone 4.  <comment143314> What is "Sam"?
