Hyper-V in Windows 10 on MacBook Pro <body> I am considering a Mac as my main development machine, and will most of the time be required to use Windows for my development work.  According to the Apple support article Turn off Hyper-V to use Windows 10 on your Mac it is not possible to use Hyper-V in Windows 10 on a Mac in Boot Camp.  This is a big limitation for me, since also it means it will be impossible to use Docker Windows Containers on a Mac, since they require Hyper-V.  Are there any practical workarounds for this?  <answer281607> It is because of the discontinuance of support for CSM (Compatibility Support Module, which basically allows legacy BIOS stuff to work on new UEFI based systems) in the newest MacBook Pro models.  Two main practical workarounds exists:  ol liInstead of using BootCamp, use a virtualization system running on macOS such as VMware Fusion, Parallels, etc. You can use nested virtualization to run the Docker containers using Hyper-V on Windows that way./li liBuy an older model of MacBook Pro which still supports booting Windows 10 with Hyper-V enabled./li /ol  I would recommend option 1. Both because a newer model gives you more bang for the buck usually, but also because Microsoft might in the future upgrade the Hyper-V functionality to work on the UEFI-only systems without CSM such as the latest MacBook Pro.  <comment363578> Is the easiest way to get Docker in Windows 10 Pro working with Parallels, Docker Toolbox and enabling Hyper-V? How to enable the Hyper-V? Related question [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287967/docker-osxs-guest-windows-10-pro-doesnt-have-vt-x-amd-v-enabled-enabling-i).
