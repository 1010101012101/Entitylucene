Does Sierra automagically update ACLs of stale files & directories? <body> I have a codebin/code directory in my home directory, in which I store random shell scripts &amp; such that I write to make my life easier.  It's been a while since I had to change anything in there, but when I tried to add a new script, the directory permissions had been set to deny write &amp; append to everyone.  I'm an old Unix person, so I understand the old-school coderwxrwxrwx/code permissions and their octal equivalents, but I know that MacOS has finer-grained ACLs as well.  However, I'm pretty sure I never did anything with ACLs, so I don't know what happened to my codebin/code directory.  (The permission bits were coderwxr-xr-x/code, so I should have been able to add my new script, but the ACL prevented it.)  Is there some sort of automatic process that might change ACLs (eme.g.,/em files that haven't been accessed for X days are protected against writing)?  Something to do with backups?  This happens occasionally, and nuking ACLs makes me nervous, so I'd really like to understand what's happening, or what I'm doing to cause permission changes outside the standard code0777/code bits.
