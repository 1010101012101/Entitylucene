How do I downgrade Java on OSX 10.6.8? <body> Software Update recently updated Java with update 6, for my 10.6.8 installation. My problem is that my bank here in Costa Rica uses a dated version of Java, and now my version of Safari (5.0.5) acts wonky when the Java applet for accessing my bank account online loads, rendering it unusable.  Is there a way to revert back to the previous update of Java on my machine? Thanks for any help!  <answer38420> This article has a pretty good answer as long as you still have your boot disk or can find a downloadable version of Java you need. Here are the instructions (copied and pasted from the article):  1 Recommend making a bootable backup before starting  2 Locate the required Java installers  precode - Leopard: download update 5  - Snow Leopard: grab your install DVD /code/pre  3 Remove current installed java stuff (warning: no going back from this point on!). In terminal:  precode sudo rm -R /Applications/Utilities/Java\ Preferences.app/  sudo rm -R /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/  sudo rm -R /System/Library/Java/  sudo rm -R /System/Library/CoreServices/Jar\ Launcher.app  sudo rm -R /System/Library/CoreServices/Java\ Web\ Start.app/  sudo rm -R /System/Library/CoreServices/JavaVersion.plist  sudo rm -R /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/JavaApplicationLauncher.framework/  sudo rm -R /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaEmbedding.framework/  sudo rm -R /System/Library/CFMSupport/StubLibraries/JavaEmbeddingLib/ /code/pre  4.1 Reinstall java: Leopard  precode - run the installer that you downloaded in step 1  - restart /code/pre  4.2 Reinstall java: Snow Leopard (haven't tested yet! but should work)  precode - insert installer DVD  - run terminal commands (change the paths in each command as necessary for both the OS X Install disc and your system hard drive):       installer -verbose -pkg "/Volumes/Mac OS X Install Disk/System/Installation/Packages/Java.pkg -target /Volumes/Macintosh HD"       installer -verbose -pkg "/Volumes/Mac OS X Install Disk/System/Installation/Packages/JavaTools.pkg -target /Volumes/Macintosh HD"  - (alternately you can use a tool like Pacifist to browse for and run the Java.pkg and JavaTools.pkg installers located in the main .pkg installer)  - restart /code/pre  Note: we have confirmed this works for Leopard but haven't verified for Snow Leopard yet.  <answer74529> I don't know if this is useful, but here you go!br http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5559  Summary:  ol liOpen Terminal, located in the Utilities folder./li liEnter this command, then press the Return or Enter key:       sudo mkdir -p /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/disabled /li liEnter this command, then press the Return or Enter key:       sudo mv /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/disabled /li liEnter this command, then press the Return or Enter key:       sudo ln -sf /System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle/Contents/Resources/JavaPlugin2_NPAPI.plugin /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin /li liTo re-enable Java SE 6 Web Start, enter this command, then press the Return or Enter key:     sudo ln -sf /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Commands/javaws /usr/bin/javaws /li /ol  <answer74537> There is a bit here on reverting to Java 5 in Snow Leopard.  http://wiki.oneswarm.org/index.php/OS_X_10.6_Snow_Leopard#Workaround_for_connection_problem   It seems much like Jamie's answer, but doesn't require a system disk.  (This no longer works in Mountain Lion, but fortunately I didn't throw away the link when I upgraded.)  <comment55528> Apparently, Macs keep the old Java frameworks around (c.f., http://serverfault.com/questions/36508/can-you-downgrade-java-on-a-mac), but I have no idea how to get Safari to actually use them on that applet. <comment86556> Welcome to SE! Is there a way you could summarize the information attained at the link? This way if the linked to article moves or is removed, your answer is still effective. <comment86568> @bassplayer7 Thanks! But I'm not really new to SE (Just the apple one)... I tried to summarize it, but I'm not sure if this is the proper way... So feel free to edit it! :D <comment86573> Edit looks great! Thank you for taking the time. I was welcoming you to *this* one - I just didn't say it specifically. ;-)
