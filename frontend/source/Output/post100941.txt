How to add Quick Look support for OpenDocument file formats? <body> I prefer OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice to MS Office because MS Office is expensive.  But OS X Quick View functionality that allows a preview of a file by taping space bar doesn't show an OpenDocument file's contents but just an icon.  ul liHow can I add Quick Look support for OpenOffice files, like .ods, .odt and .odp ?/li /ul  I know OpenOffice can write MS Office documents but it would be nice to have Quick Look understand the OpenDocument formats.   Note: ods are spreadsheets, odt are word processor documents and odp are presentations.  <answer116553> NeoOffice claims to offer QuickLook support. This may provide the functionality you are looking for.  Consider making a request for QuickLook support as part of OpenOffice; the community pages are a good place to make this request more likely to be seen by the developers.  <answer130184> There's a longstanding request for it at https://issues.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=68600  And an early implementation is at http://eric.bachard.free.fr/mac/aquavcl/patches/aqua_February2008/quicklook/  To install, place codeOOoQuickLook.qlgenerator/code from that site into code/Library/QuickLook/code and wait a few minutes for QuickLook to detect the new generator.  <comment286047> Does anyone know the current status? Is there a more up-to-date QuickLook plugin for OpenOffice/`ods` files? <comment286493> @Winterflags LibreOffice has its own enhancement request at https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35361, but no progress from either camp.
