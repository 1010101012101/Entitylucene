What is tmp.0.sDQWBe? <body> I have a file called codetmp.0.sDQWBe/code located on my MacBook/Macintosh HD code/private/var/folders/k1/(a ton of random text)/T/tmp.0.sDQWBe/code. The file is 13.2GB and I have strongno idea/strong what it is.  I want to delete it so it can free up space on my computer. What is it, and can I delete it?  <answer226724> A simple reboot may purge some of this. /var is generally for variable files (caches, logs, etc). You can check to see which process is using the file before deleting, if it is indeed open. There are a number of ways to do this via the terminal.   After a little research I found this gem of an article, What is "/var/folders"?.    <comment275329> If you reboot the Mac does the file still exist and at that size? <comment275330> Yes it does, it is weird. <comment275331> The fact that the file's name starts with "tmp." is a good indication that it's meant to be temporary and given its location, I'd say it was safe to delete.  That said, it goes without saying... always make sure you have a backup just in case.  In Terminal, I'd move it to a different name, adding say ".bak" to it, then reboot and see if the file is recreated.  If it's not and everything appears to be okay, then delete it.
