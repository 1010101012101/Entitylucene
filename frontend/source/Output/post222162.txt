How to delete a subscription to a calendar? <body> iOS 7.1.2  I think I added a subscription to a calendar through:  precodeSettings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account &gt; Other          &gt; Add Subscribed Calendar /code/pre  This is a calendar about national holidays. I am convinced I added it because I searched this function for a long time. But I have no track of the origin of this subscription, either within the configuration of codeCalendar/code on iPhone, or within any Apple technical documentation. Then this subscription might also be a magic one (based on configuration, or actual position).  I know how to hide this subscribed calendar.  Now I would like to remove this subscription.  I searched if there wasn't any trick with complex finger manipulations around this subscription entry within:  precodeCalendar &gt; Calendars &gt; Edit /code/pre  ul lithrow it on the right/li lithrow it on the left/li lithrow it upward/li lithrow it downward/li lilong click/li livery long click/li /ul  Nothing! This function might be better hidden, in too deep a labyrinth or beyond my reach.  What is the way to delete a subscribed calendar on iPhone?  <comment269195> Usually you remove it the same way you added it. So, you go to `Settings`  `Mail, Contacts & Calendars`, tap on your subscribed calendar account and tap remove at the bottom. <comment269243> I don't have a remove at the bottom. Perhaps this subscription is set by default. Anyway I don't have any documentation or information to confirm this hypothesis. <comment269245> If you added it yourself, you will have a remove button. I know that one subscribed calendar is added by default (at least with iOS 9, though you state you have 7.1.2), which cannot be removed and that is the vacation calendar of the country you set up. For me, it is US Holidays. The only thing you can do there is to disable it.
