Is there a way to edit the dictionary file for Dictionary.app? <body> I use Dictionary.app for learning languages quite often. I'd like to take notes in some entries in Dictionary.app so that I could see them when I revisit the same entry in the future, but is there a way to insert text in some entries in the dictionary file? I'm going to automate the process with AppleScript.  What I'd like to do is take notes like "This is important" or copy and paste example sentences from the Web into the related entries.   <comment271694> This may have already been answered.  Please check http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25738/how-do-i-add-words-to-the-os-x-user-dictionary <comment271695> @Hefewe1zen Is what that's talking about the same as the dictionary file that Dicaitonary.app uses? The question you linked says it's *user* dictionary? <comment271702> @Hefewe1zen No, that's different. What I'd like to do is take notes for a learning purpose not for spell checking. <comment271703> If the Dictionary app does not provide a way to annotate itself, which under OS X 10.8.5 that I'm using it doesn't (sans the User Dictionary), then you probably have to make your own custom Dictionary which would be available to the Dictionary app.  See: [Dictionary Services Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/DictionaryServicesProgGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) <comment271705> @user3439894 Thanks! Does it involve compiling that takes time? I've seen some relevant article says I have to compile it to make it a .dict file or something. I want to add notes frequently, so I guessed it might not work taking too much time to reflect the changes on to the Dictionary.app and just gave up then. Sorry for asking this kind of question. I'm not a native English speaker, so it takes time even just to skim articles, so I feel I'd better ask first rather than take a lot of time and end up with nothing. <comment271706> Ah I understand now.  There is a utility that converts dictionary files into Apple's format (https://github.com/jjgod/mac-dictionary-kit).  So perhaps your best bet is to make/amend your own dictionary and then convert / import. <comment271709> @stacko, Having never compiled a dictionary I can't say how long it would take however I do compile command line utilities and they tend to compile  relatively quickly.  The issue for you though is having to modify code and recompile each time you wanted to add to the custom dictionary and unless you could script the process it might just be too much work to maintain to begin with.
