Can I delete /Library/Updates on EI Capitan <body> I'm trying reduce my drive space requirement. I discovered code/Library/Updates/code is taking up a lot of space.  After a quick Google, I found code/Library/Updates/code is used to store system updates file which have not been applied.  So is it safe to clean up code/Library/Updates/code?  <answer211975> Theoretically, there should only be updates in that folder until you actually run the updates, then they should be cleared - so my first suggestion would be to check the App Store app &amp; run any pending updates from there, reboot, then recheck the folder.  Anything left over at that point ought to be safe to delete, though I would retain the codeindex.plist/code codePPDVersions.plist/code &amp; codeProductMetadata.plist/code files, if present, unless you are having general updating issues, as I suspect they are designed to accurately track the update state.
