Upgrading a dev 2011 MBA to Mavericks <body> I have a 2011 MBA (i5 1.7Ghz with 4GB RAM) running Lion 10.7.5. I'm tempted to do a Mavericks upgrade (in the particular hope of improving power and memory management), but since this is a development machine, with a ton of stuff installed with codehomebrew/code.  Can I upgrade to Mavericks without impacting my codehomebrew/code installation too much (or how can I recover/rebuild it easily if necessary)?  <comment146444> You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately. <comment146449> Really? I understand your point, but I don't think that edit was quite necessary, as my questions were pretty much related and complementary. <comment146451> Usually people here accept *one* answer at the end to show which answer helped them the most. If one answer covers the upgrade part of the question and another the 2nd question you asked, which one are you going to accept? Also, keeping questions focused increases their value in the long term. And you even might find an already available answer here to your second question (at least the [topic](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/93850/roll-back-from-os-x-mavericks-or-any-newer-os-to-mountain-lion) has come up before).
