Batch Job Scheduler <body> This might be weird to ask, since in all these years I've never used a Mac as a "remote scheduler", but this is what I need now.  Can you recommend a strongbatch job scheduler/strong?  What I need is to login via codessh/code, launch commands and be able to exit from the shell. When the system will be able, the scheduler will run my job (usually a shell script). It would be cool to have the system send an email when it finishes.  I have seen codescreen/code or codeat/code, but it's not what I'd really need (codeat/code requires a time, and codescreen/code is just a shell that can be detached). With these tools I need to manually schedule jobs. I've used some clustering facilities under linux, using codeqsub/code to submit jobs, and it was neat.   However, installing codetorque/code might be really cumbersome, and I am stuck with it. It needs codeopenssl-devel/code and I don't know how to install that, I thought using codehomebrew/code and installing codeopenssl/code (with the correct code$PATH/code) would be sufficient, but it's not.  Do you have any "easy" to setup batch scheduler recommendation?  Thanks!  <answer225724> Looking at the List of job scheduler software at WikipediA which support emevent driven/em job scheduling and lists OS X as a Platform was only one package, JobServer by Grand Logic.  Being that this info is from WikipediA, this of course by no means is necessarily a complete and or authoritative list, however it's a place to start.   <comment273797> You question is about  a scheduler and yet you said, ..."`at`, but it's not what I'd really need (`at` requires a time"... Well that's ironic!  Isn't the very nature of a scheduler to do something at a set or given date and time? <comment273928> Sort of. A batch scheduler will execute commands subsequently without prior knowledge on the time it will take. The at command requires a time, so I need to estimate it, and I will always fail in this :) <comment273962> So in your question, why didn't you just simply say you're looking for an _event driven batch job scheduler_? :) <comment274003> Because it's not event driven usually, as Torque, but I didn't see the source to know how it determines when and where to execute something. It doesn't compile, I won't read the docs until it does :)
