How do I give options to Homebrew install <body> Is it possible to give options to a Homebrew installation package from the command line, something like this (which does not seem to work):  precodebrew install tesseract --all-languages /code/pre  Or do you have to use codebrew edit tesseract/code and actually edit your desired options into the file that opens?  (If the latter is the only way, why did they choose to do it like this? It seems very cumbersome.)  EDIT: I did codeuninstall/code, then codeinstall/code again with the option added, and now it seems to react. 1. Homebrew should have been able to understand the change without uninstalling first. 2. I can't see the option thing documented or mentioned anywhere.  <answer125251> codebrew info/code lists options:  precode$ brew info tesseract tesseract: stable 3.02.02, HEAD http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ Not installed From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/tesseract.rb ==&gt; Dependencies Required: libtiff, leptonica ==&gt; Options --all-languages     Install recognition data for all languages --HEAD     install HEAD version /code/pre  Like the edit to the question says, if you have already installed a package and want to install the package with different options, you have to uninstall it first.  <answer271599> codebrew options &lt;program_package&gt;/code will list all the available options to flag with the install &amp; yes, as far as I know if you want to install with any options posthumously then you'll first need to uninstall. If you don't remember the installation "formula" you used, then, use codebrew info &lt;program_package&gt;/code prior to uninstalling. codeinfo/code will also inform you of any dependencies, but codebrew uninstall &lt;program_package&gt;/code will tell you the specific command to force the removal of dependencies if there are any. Lastly, prior to re-installing with codebrew install &lt;program_package&gt; &lt;--options&gt;/code it's a good idea to run codebrew update/code twice and codebrew doctor/code twice... codebrew prune/code, codebrew cleanup/code &amp; codebrew missing/code are also not a terrible idea to run before or after install/re-installs.
