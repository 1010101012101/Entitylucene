Search for a string in Preview <body> I use Preview's Command-F (find) to search for C# in the pdf document. However, the result is not for 'C#', but just 'C': I get hundreds of meaningless search results.  How can I get the search result exactly for 'C#' or 'C++' in Preview?  <answer3916> Enclose the search string in double quotes, as such: "C++". This will filter the search results from the search for "C" so select strongRelevance/strong as your sorting criterion from the gray toolbar that appears. All the pages with occurrences of "C++" will then be presented first.  <answer3929> I've not found a way to get Preview to search for characters like code#/code or code+/code, but strongSkim/strong, an alternative PDF viewer (homepage here), is a good replacement/addition to Preview and is able to search more specifically.  I've tested it and found it was able to find codeC++/code (without needing any quotes/special options) without bringing up all codeC/code results.  It was also able to search specifically for accented characters (like codeé/code or codeö/code) — though requires such characters to be accented in the search to find them (i.e. you can't search for codeblah/code and expect it to match codebläh/code, nor vice versa). In Preview, either search will return matches for both accented and unaccented characters.  <answer73011> Use Google Chrome's built-in pdf renderer. Enter the codefile:///path/to/file.pdf/code URL of the file, or bring up the file browser by entering a know directory, like codefile:///Users/home/code and navigate to the file location.  <answer202819> You could just open the PDF in Safari. Safari has a more standard approach to searching PDFs -- it looks for exactly what you type. Preview used to behave this way, but somewhere around OS X 10.5, Apple tried to make it smarter, e.g., looking for pages that contain some or all of the words you type, instead of treating your words as a phrase. This new behavior in Preview is much less useful to me, but I don't know any way to turn it off. You can partly get around it by putting quotes around phrases, but I haven't found any way to get Preview to search for symbols, e.g., "C++".  <comment3743> The quotes allow you to search for whole words, but the `++` in the search is still entirely ignored. As far as I can tell, the search function in PDFkit will ignore a lot of characters (like '+') and treat accented characters like their non-accented versions (é as e) when searching. This makes it easier for basic searching but harder to find an exact string. <comment3744> Actually this might just be a limitation of Preview rather than PDFkit... <comment29984> This doesn't work for me either. Searching for a command like `ignore=` will return results like 'IgnoreInterfaceRegex' and commands like `ignore:`. Quoting doesn't make a difference. As an alternative to Preview, try Adobe Reader which works fine. <comment84779> Safari doesn't seem to ignore special characters either. And you can also just drag the files on the browsers. <comment84913> Yes, DnD seems to work just fine, thanks for pointing that out.
