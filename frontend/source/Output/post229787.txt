How can I show geolocation of one specific photo on a map in iOS? <body> Just changed from Samsung Galaxy 5 to iPhone. Galaxy's feature I liked was click on a photo, then more info, and if the photo was geotagged, it would open a map showing location.   I can only show location of groups of photos on my iPhone, is there any way to select a single photo and show the location on a map? I see the generic location (i.e., Downtown Long Beach) but I can not see a specific location.  Anyone know a way to bring up a map of a single selected photo?  <answer234684> You can see the exact location by following these steps (iOS 9.3.1).  These steps assume the photo contains geolocation info, this info might have been removed by the author.  ol liIn codeSettings/code, ensure you can see locations for photos in codePrivacy --&gt; Location Services --&gt; Camera/code./li liIn codePhotos/code, find the image, or images, you want the location.  There will be a header across the top with the general location./li liTap on the general location header (i.e. Downtown Long Beach), strongnot/strong the image.  This will take you to the Maps app with the location the image was taken.  If there's multiple images, you can see the exact location for each image./li /ol
