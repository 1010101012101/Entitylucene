Please suggest me either I have to purchage only Apple earphone only? Thanks   <answer220811> Yes, headphones are headphones and the audio jack is standardized (see this Wikipedia article for more details).   <comment267293> Did you plug them in and try?  Are they just standard 3.5 mm headphones? <comment267294> I didn't tried ...but they are 3.5mm..I didn't tried because of I thought they may give some problem <comment267296> Ok so I can use without any problem? <comment267297> That's what standards are all about :-) <comment267316> "Problem"? Like your iPad exploding?
