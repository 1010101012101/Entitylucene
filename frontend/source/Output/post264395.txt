Recovery Mode is not available for MacBook Pro <body> I have a MacBook Pro mid 2009 with El Capitan running on it.   I wanted to enter Recovery Mode and pressed kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appeared with a progress bar. After about 3 hours waiting the progress bar was complete but nothing happened. I waited another two hours but still nothing changed.   When booting in normal mode everything is fine and within a minute I can start working. Do you have any advice for me?

Not all hard disk crashes are due to head landing, they can be electronical components overheat, the electronic components fails gradually slowing down the disk speed to null in a few months. I suggest a disk clone and a swap.  <comment331288> Oh by the way I checked my hard drive in disk utility and there were no errors. <comment331307> One question is have since it's a 2009 and drive replacement is a distinct possibility: running from a drive clone? <comment331318> Go to Terminal (in Utilities), run `diskutil list` and paste the output into the question text please. <comment331340> Try booting into internet recovery mode (cmd + option + R) <comment331375> @NoahL  I also tried that option but with the same result <comment331378> @LexSuser87973 I added the output above
