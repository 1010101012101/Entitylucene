Retina MBP won't recognize Archboot flash drive <body> I'm trying to install Arch on a flash drive. To do so, I'm trying to first get a bootable, "live" version of Arch on the flash drive I'm going to install it on later.  I've followed the instructions here to the letter, but for some reason, the Mac's bootloader doesn't recognize the flash drive at all, and it's not showing up on my desktop as an external storage device.  It does, however, show up in Disk Utility, and when I run codediskutil list/code in the terminal. Attempts to mountDisk are failing repeatedly, both from the terminal and GUI disk  utilities.  Has anyone else here had this problem? How did you fix it?  <comment120182> What is Arch or ArchBoot? <comment120195> It's a Linux distro, but the problem is with Apple software/firmware (most likely), which is why I'm asking here.
