Immobilise Desktops <body> I want to make my Desktops stay in an order that I want. I want to have my first 3 Desktops locked and others dynamic in example:  ul liI'm working on Desktop1. When an app is full screen the app is between Desktop1 and Desktop2 but I want it to open after Desktop4 since the others mounted. /li liI'm working on Desktop3. When I open an app from Dock(or cmd+tab) which is currently opened in Desktop1, Desktop1 and Desktop2 changes positions. I don't want this to happen I want to go to Desktop1 without changing the order./li /ul  Hope I explained clearly. Is there a way I can immobilise some Desktops.  <answer198534> You can have them all static or dynamic but not a mix of both.  To make them static (so they stay as you put them) do this:  ul liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong/li liClick on strongMission Control/strong/li liUncheck strongAutomatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use/strong/li /ul  This will keep them as they are arranged by you.  To arrange them, drag them to the desired position after launching Mission Control.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nCSmb.png" alt="Mission Control settings"  <comment237570> nice one a + from me, keep them coming :) <comment237571> Thanks, Buscarì›ƒ I try to do what I can when I have time. ;)
