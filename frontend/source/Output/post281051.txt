Running script after connecting to VPN <body> I am using MacOS 10.12.  I just started working for a company that gave me a VPN connection to connect to.  I'm trying to come up with a script that, upon VPN connection, will:  ol liadd route to remote VPN subnet/li limount NAS share via SMB/li /ol  Also, if possible this script would execute automatically when I connect to VPN. That part would be convenient but that's over my head.  My simple script:  precode#!/bin/bash    #add route to remote subnet sudo route add –net 192.168.200.0/24 –interface ppp0    #connect to remote NAS share as currnt user mount -t smbfs //192.168.200.10/Share /mnt/companyname /code/pre  Will this work? Any advice is appreciated!
