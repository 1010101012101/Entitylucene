Where does Photos.app store its library and files? <body> I switched from iPhoto to Photos and now one feature that was important to me is missing: "Show referenced files in Finder".  For example, that feature was useful to me for selective sharing. Also for other things, like complete Library backups, I think it is very important to know how Photos.app works and where it stores the files.  <answer183074> After looking for it, I found it. Quite obvious actually, it is next to the former iPhoto Library.  code~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/code  Researching a little more, because both libraries report the same size, the import from iPhoto to Photos changed all original files to hardlinks. So either library contains a pointer to one file on disk, thus saving disk space.  For a full backup, I think it is sufficient to backup code~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/code.  <answer244484> If you go to the following path code/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/code, then right click on codePhotos Library.photoslibrary/code and select emShowPackageContents/em.    Then you can select the masters folder and backup the original photos.br Hope this helps.   <comment218198> @TheBro21 [Code formatting is not a form of emphasis.](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2199) This is the #1 reason I reject some of your edits. <comment218342> @grgarsode Ok thanks for advice.
