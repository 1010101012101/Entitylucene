Will an iOS device in Kiosk mode display 'upgrade iOS alerts'? <body> If I put an iPad in Kiosk mode so that it will only run 1 app, will I still get iOS update alerts flashing up?   I've noticed that iOS on my iPhone has recently started showing alerts to update to iOS 10. It never used to do this for previous iOS updates; you used to just get a red dot on the settings app.    <comment317862> My iPhones have been doing this since at least iOS 9, maybe even iOS 8. It's not something new.
