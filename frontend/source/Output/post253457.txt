Unable to copy a file from desktop to user sandboxed container directory: "Operation not permitted" <body> I have a Java FX OS X application, which internally tries to copy the selected file to a temp location while performing an operation.  But while trying to do that by right clicking the file, I see that the copy operation failed and in the logs it prints: "Operation not permitted"  When my application was not sandboxed, I didn't face this problem .  The moment it got sandboxed, it fails to do the copy. Earlier I thought that this is happening because I am copying the file outside the sandbox directory ,but that was not the issue. The copy is happening from /Users/abc/Desktop/a.txt to /Users/abc/Library/Containers/com.abc.core.xxx/Data/Library/Application Support  So the target directory is a sandboxed directory. Although I believe the source file is not accessible by the sandbox. But I don't know what has to be done in order to make it accessible. Any help would be appreciated.
