Upgrading RAM of a MacBook <body> Is it possible to upgrade memory to 8 GB my model of MacBook? The manual says no, but on the web some people have made some videos about the upgrade. I don't know if any of them are fake.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xFhhc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer50538> I found this site:  Other World Computing RAM upgrade for MacBook 6,1  http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/Apple_MacBook_MacBook_Pro/Upgrade/DDR3_White  It seems it's possible to upgrade.  <answer52584> I upgraded. It worked!  So, different as it said in manual.. yes my Mac Version supports 8GB .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0xBDw.jpg" alt="Image 1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6YaJJ.png" alt="Image 2"  <comment57949> Other World Computing, at macsales.com (the link above), is a great place to look. They specialize in upgrading the RAM in Macs, and they have expertise in exceeding the recommended Apple specs where that's possible. Thanks to them I have a 2007 MacBook Pro with 6GB of RAM, even though Apple has always said that only 4GB is possible with my model. <comment57954> Great @WheatWilliams! <comment57980> My MacBook Pro officially supports 4GB, but thanks to Other World it's now running 8GB without trouble. Cheap, too!
