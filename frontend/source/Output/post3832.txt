How can I print a booklet from a pdf file? <body> I have a pdf document, and I want to print it as a booklet, i.e. two pages of the document on each side of a sheet of paper and so that (when printed) the entire thing can just be folded in the middle to create a small booklet.  How can I do this easily?  <answer3875> Open the PDF in preview, go to the print dialog and you'll find some (hopefully) helpful settings — I say hopefully as I've not done emexactly/em what you're after...  Click the little down arrow next to the printer name to expand the print dialog if its not already larger. In the bottom half of the dialog window, there's a drop-down menu where you can select a few relevant options:  ul liIn Layout (in the drop-down menu), strongPages per Sheet/strong (you can set this to 2 to have a left and right side on each page)/li liAlso in Layout, strongTwo-Sided/strong (you can choose the paper edge over which the binding would occur — not sure how this works for folding in the middle though.../li liThe drop-down also has a section called strongBooklet Printing/strong, which has various options that will be of interest to you, mostly the first checkbox to enable booklet printing :)/li /ul  Now I've not done it myself, and I don't know if it'll work for folding the pages in the middle (it looks like its intended for binding the pages along one edge) but that's probably the place to start looking.  If it doesn't work as is, then you may need to manually rearrange the pages (which you can do in Preview) to be in the right order so that simple double sided printing with short-edge binding puts the pages in the right places, though this may be quite difficult if there's a lot of pages...  Good luck...  <answer3883> You can use the Create Booklet utilitysup1/sup which adds an option to “print”, from Preview or any other app, to generate a second pdf file with the pages arranged appropriately to print and bind as a booklet. When printing the resulting pdf booklet, remember to select “Two-Sided: Short-Edge binding” in the “Layout” options of the print dialog.  em1.

It costs US $35, and has a free trial with some features disabled. It is affordable for casual use, but also good enough for professional imposition.  <answer189955> For a free and universal alternative you can use the codepdfbook/code script, part of the codepdfjam/code collection which is usually included in LaTeX distributions (notably MacTeX). It's simple to use from the command line:  precodepdfbook mypdf.pdf /code/pre  If the above doesn't work, then code/Library/TeX/texbin/code isn't in your PATH (or code/usr/texbin/code for older versions of MacTeX). The best course of action is to ensure PATH is correctly set (lots of command line programs will fail if the PATH variable isn't correct and codepdfbook/code is one of them); this isn't trivial under OS X if you want a consistent behavior between applications launched from the dock and applications run from a terminal so you definitely should search a complete solution to this specific problem. As dirty work-around, you can run codeexport PATH="$PATH:/Library/TeX/texbin:/usr/texbin"/code every time before you use codepdfbook/code (including in the service below).  If you don't want to use the command line, you can create a service easily.  ol liLaunch Automator (on Yosemite it's in Applications/Others)/li liCreate a new document and select "Service"./li liOn top of the right frame, for "Service receives selected" choose "PDF files"./li liSearch "Run Shell Script" from the bar on the top of the left frame and double-click it. Select to "Pass input" as "arguments" in the newly created window./li liEnter a simple script running codepdfbook/code, for instance codepdfbook "$@"/code./li liSave it as "Create booklet" (for instance)./li liIn Finder, select a PDF file, then in the menu go to Services/Create booklet./li /ol  My complete script also creates a temporary file and opens the resulting PDF:  precodeTMPF=`mktemp -t bookletXXXX` mv "$TMPF" "$TMPF.pdf" pdfbook -o "$TMPF.pdf" "$@" open "$TMPF.pdf" /code/pre  The most obvious problem is the several GB download and installation of a LaTeX distribution if all you want is the codepdfbook/code script.  <answer274928> My solution is to install Macintosh version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, available from https://get.adobe.com/reader/, and use it to open the PDF file. When printing from Adobe Reader, there is several options in page sizing and handling :  ol liPoster/li liMultiple/li liBooklet/li /ol  Choose Booklet and you're good to go.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hbdbn.png" alt="Screenshot of Adobe Reader in OS X"  See https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/print-booklets-acrobat-reader.html for more detail. The advantage of this solution that the same solution also works in the Windows world.  <comment3668> In the drop-down menu I see no option for “Booklet Printing”, is this perhaps an option from a specific printer? <comment3692> oh, sorry, you're right :/ I didn't realise this was part of the HP driver for the printers here at work... you could still play around with the page order and 2 pages per sheet / double sided printing I guess... <comment57488> I have used this tool with OSX 10.7.3 and it works fine - quite nice functionality in a low weight package. <comment132976> @Phrogz, thanks for letting me know. Indeed, I've updated the link to point to the developer's site. <comment165333> It looks like the link needs another update: http://thekeptpromise.com/FreeApps/#CreateBooklet <comment209456> The URL has changed again, it's now: http://thekeptpromise.com/CreateBooklet/ - also, they're charging for it these days. However, it was only $4.99 at time of commenting, which is worth the time it saved me :) <comment227017> I just installed mactex and I don't seem to have pdfbook. Any other steps I need to take? <comment228005> I've checked the TeX Live repository (which MacTeX uses), `pdfbook` is there so it definitely looks like a PATH problem. Sadly, you can't just use the full path of the script (which is `/usr/texbin/pdfbook`) because then it will fail to find its parent script `pdfjam`. I've updated my answer with an explanation of the problem and a dirty work-around, but you definitely should fix the PATH problem globally instead (I don't remember how I did it and couldn't find the SO question I used back then but it's there somewhere).
