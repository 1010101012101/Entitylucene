Mountain Lion Installer detects hard drive damage <body> I downloaded and ran the Mountain Lion Installer today for my mid-2007 iMac. After rebooting and preparing to install, I receive an error message that the hard disk was damaged and the installer could not run.   I can't boot to the partition and am working from the install partition instead. Disk Utility cannot repair the partition, and detects no problems with parent volume. Time Machine cannot restore to the partition as it is apparently locked or unavailable (it is greyed out in the program).   I've booted in Single User mode and run code/sbin/fsck -fy/code and code/sbin/mount -uw //code, but this does not allow me to run codefsck/code on the problem volume - just the install partition it appears.  This is the partition info from codediskutil info /dev/disk0s2/code:     precodeDevice Identifier:        disk0s2    Device Node:              /dev/disk0s2    Part of Whole:            disk0    Device / Media Name:      WD Black Caviar     Volume Name:              WD Black Caviar    Escaped with Unicode:     WD%FF%FE%20%00Black%FF%FE%20%00Caviar     Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Volumes/WD Black Caviar    Escaped with Unicode:     /Volumes/WD%FF%FE%20%00Black%FF%FE%20%00Caviar     File System Personality:  HFS+    Type (Bundle):            hfs    Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended    Owners:                   Enabled     Partition Type:           Apple_HFS    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 SATA    SMART Status:             Verified    Volume UUID:              8880D8D2-AEC8-3466-81D3-4ABBE296733A     Total Size:               1.3 TB (1278311751680 Bytes) (exactly 2496702640 512-Byte-Blocks)    Volume Free Space:        817.2 GB (817164238848 Bytes) (exactly 1596023904 512-Byte-Blocks)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Yes    Ejectable:                No     Whole:                    No    Internal:                 Yes    Solid State:              No /code/pre  `  How can I regain write access to the partition to diagnose it?  Thanks.  <answer60364> Please "burn" ML to USB or DVD and boot by it. Then use Disk Utility to repair the disk (or partition). It may be a cable HDD problem, or the HDD is bad.  <answer60708> To fix this I re-partitioned the volume from Disk Utility running off a USB boot volume. This got the volume accessible and responsive again. Then I restored from an earlier Time Machine backup, and proceeded to re-download and run the Mountain Lion installer, this time with no problems.  While it may be faulty hardware somewhere, I can't rule out that a bug or some other interference for the Mountain Lion installer damaged the partition. It has been working fine for days now, and was working fine prior to ML.  <comment69536> Thanks. I copied `InstallESD.dmg` to a USB drive and ran Disk Utility from there. It cannot repair the partition, and recommends I reformat it. What exactly is a cable HDD problem? The cable connecting the HDD to the controller may be bad? <comment69612> If Disk Utilities can't help you in this problem, please go to Genuine Apple. Replace cable/hdd (or both).
