Photostream folder missing in photos <body> I am running current OSX and iOS. In the Photos app, the PhotoStream folder/content is present on Mac-A, but on Mac-B PhotoStream is missing. All other iPhone folders,eg panorama/time-lapse/bursts, etc are present. Uncertain how to fix. Any ideas on enabling the display of PhotoStream  <comment354401> Some questions. By _current OSX_ do you mean macOS Sierra 10.12.4 ? Is this a new development, or has it always been the case? Also, are you logged into iCloud on both Macs and on the same account? Finally, what have you already tried to get this working?
