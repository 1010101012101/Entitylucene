Problem with installing any app via NPM <body> strongWhat's going wrong?/strong  I try to install something and after the install I can launch it. System doesn't see the installed app.  For example: I tried to install "appium-doctor" and I did it successfully.  precodenpm install -g appium-doctor /Users/oleg/.npm-global/bin/appium-doctor -&gt; /Users/oleg/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/appium-doctor/appium-doctor.js /Users/oleg/.npm-global/lib └── appium-doctor@1.4.1  /code/pre  After that I tried to launch the appium-doctor, and I got the error:  precodeiMac-Ponomarenko:~ oleg$ appium-doctor -bash: appium-doctor: command not found /code/pre  My environment:  - npm -v prints: 4.1.2   - node -v prints: v6.9.5  - npm config get registry prints: https://registry.npmjs.org/  - OS: OS X El Capitan  strongWhat problem is the feature intended to solve?/strong  I want to install appium 1.6.3. And i need "gulp" for it.  <answer273005> Try it by providing full path, like /Applications/some_folder/appium-doctor to launch this app. It looks like system is not able to locate the binary 'appium-doctor'. If it works then you can add that $path in .bash_profile.  <comment343174> Yes, it works. I can run the binary 'appium-doctor if I pointed a full path'. How can I paste it variable to .bash_profile? <comment343183> Happy to hear the feedback from you, you can edit .bash_profile using vi editor in terminal and add your path along with other $PATH specified. Save .bash_profile and close & re-open terminal for changes to get reflect. So that next time on wards the system will look for the binary in the newly specified location(PATH).
