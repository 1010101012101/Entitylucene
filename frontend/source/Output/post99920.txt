Entering superscript text (exponents) in TextEdit? <body> I am writing math problems on my iMac and I am using TextEdit. I need to add exponents to one of my problems. How can I do that?  <answer99929> You can superscript style any text by highlighting the text and then selecting codeFormat -&gt; Font -&gt; Baseline -&gt; Superscript/code from the menu in TextEdit.  It's not assigned to a keyboard shortcut by default. To assign it to a keyboard shortcut go to codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Keyboard/code and click on the codeKeyboard Shortcuts/code tab. Select codeApplication Shortcuts/code from the left hand list and press the code+/code button button below the right hand list to add a new application-specific shortcut:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGXvK.png" alt="enter image description here"  From the menu that pops up select codeTextEdit/code as the application (otherwise the shortcut will be made for all applications). For codeMenu Title/code enter codeFormat-&gt;Font-&gt;Baseline-&gt;Superscript/code and for codeKeyboard Shortcut/code (assuming OS X 10.8 or higher). Put your cursor in the box and press the combination of keys you want to use for the shortcut (I used Cmd+Shift+= in my screen capture example):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KTjFY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Press codeAdd/code button to store the shortcut. You might have to restart TextEdit for the shortcut to appear.  <answer99930> h2Modify the Press &amp; Hold keys/h2  For entering numbers in superscript (exponents), I prefer the Press &amp; Hold method since it works in any app regardless of whether the app supports it (e.g. plain-text editors).  ol liNavigate to codeSystem/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources//code./li liBackup the codeKeyboard-en.plist/code file./li liAppend the following to the codeKeyboard-en.plist/code file (before the closing code&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/plist&gt;/code).  precode&lt;key&gt;Roman-Accent-t&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Direction&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;right&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Keycaps&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;t ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹ ⁰&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Strings&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;t ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹ ⁰&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre/li /ol  Feel free to change the codeRoman-Accent-t/code to any character you wish, providing it does not already have Press &amp; Hold keys assigned.  <comment117576> Thanks! Will this work on all word-processing software? <comment117613> It's application specific. <comment117619> One disadvantage of this method is that it may not look good with all fonts and you are limited to the characters you have put into the .plist.  Exponents can have things other than numbers in them.
