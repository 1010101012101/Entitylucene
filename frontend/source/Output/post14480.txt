Can I reactivate my Peggle Nights in-app purchase on my new iPad without being charged again? <body> I own Peggle for iPhone and bought the Peggle Nights addon from within the app. I installed Peggle on my new iPad, but Peggle Nights isn't available.  I've seen other iOS games (like 100 Rogues) that have a "check for purchases" feature alongside "purchase", but Peggle doesn't have this. If I click "purchase", will I be charged another $4, or will the app just reactivate my purchase?  (After a few back-and-forth emails with PopCap support trying to get them to understand my question, they punted and suggested I ask Apple.)  <answer14482> iTunes Store: About In-App Purchases     If you lose your In-App Purchases   because apps were accidentally   deleted, or if you had to restore your   device without a backup, you may be   able to download some of your in app   purchases again for free. Not all   In-App Purchases are eligible for free   download again.      ul   liReplenishable In-App Purchases and    subscriptions cannot be downloaded again for free, and must be  repurchased. Examples include but are not limited to: extra ammo additional health, extra experience points, or other one-time services. /li   liNon-replenishable In-App Purchases    and auto-renewing subscriptions can be downloaded again for free. Examples include: bonus game levels a map/city guide, a daily news subscription, or other recurring  services.  /li   liTo download an In-App    Purchase again, you must download it from within the installed app using the same iTunes Store account name for the original In-App Purchase./li   /ul   It's an addon that is not limited, ergo a emnon-replenishable In-App purchase/em. So I would say it has to work.  <comment15626> Agreed, as long as it's the same iTunes/Apple account the in-app purchase will be free. If it charges you, contact Apple and you'll get a refund, but it won't charge you.
