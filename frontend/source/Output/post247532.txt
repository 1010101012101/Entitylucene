Missing keyboard shortcut in El Capitan 10.11.5 to switch between windows within app <body> I've just started running El Capitan (10.11.5) and one of my favorite keyboard shortcuts seems to have disappeared: the keyboard shortcut that let you move between windows within the same application. It used to be kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd ` /kbd  (tilde) but now that shortcut doesn't work and I can't figure out how to get it back.   Any ideas? Thank you in advance.  <answer247547> The codeKeyboard/code item in codeSystem Preferences/code has a codeShortcuts/code tab. The codeKeyboard/code item in the codeShortcuts/code tab has one item labeled codeMove focus to next window/code. The binding for that has a kbd ` /kbd  rather than a kbd ~ /kbd  (with the kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd key; I don't know how to type a cloverleaf), but either binding has the same effect for me (that box is checked on my Mac).  It's possible you simply need to check that box; in any case, that seems like the first place to look.  <comment305505> I changed the commands to 'Ask Different standard' & added the cover-leaf for you :) I actually have it as a shortcut in System Prefs  Keyboard  Text [I also have the Ask Different standard key command syntax in there] Check my edit to see how it's done <comment305506> I appreciate the assistance with my answer. Thanks! <comment305508> I think that's a 'backtick', not a tilde - that's the accent that goes over the n in mañana... on its own, ~ <comment305595> Thank you – that did the trick!
