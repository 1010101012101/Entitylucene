How to disable 'Exit Full Screen' with escape on Yosemite <body> If I press kbdEscape/kbd by mistake while working, it exits full screen mode.  I could use kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd if I want to exit full screen mode. How can I prevent kbdEscape/kbd key in full screen mode?  <answer207955>    Now, you could go ahead and brute-force disable the Escape key in   Safari. But that'd defeat the purpose of still allowing Escape to work   as a shortcut in the aforementioned places, which I'd rather avoid.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQ06R.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  http://patricklenz.co/blog/2014/9/1/dont-escape-full-screen-mode-in-safari  Btw I think that your question is a duplicate : Disable Escape key in Safari for getting out of full screen mode  <comment227605> You can set this in System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts. Look for the escape key, replace it with something else. Add a keyboard shortcut (If there isn't an existing one) And set Ctrl+Cmd+F to exit fullscreen. You can make an automator service to exit fullscreen if there isn't a function on it already (I am not on my mac now, so I cannot be 100% sure) <comment228078> Thanks The Bro21, I could see the 'Launchpad & Dock', 'Mission Control', 'Keyboard', 'Input Sources' 'Screen Shots', 'Services', 'Spotlight', 'Accessibility', 'App Shortcuts', but I couldn't see any assignment to 'ESC' key now. sad.. But I appreciate your contribution. <comment228162> I think you double click the service, then press ESC to assign <comment295324> As far as I can tell, the service is not available to change the shortcut.
