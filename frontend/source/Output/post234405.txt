How to disable pretty-print in Safari inspector? <body> Pretty-print is always on by default. How do I make it be off by default?  <comment286597> This question is very similar to [this one][1]. You may find your answer here.      [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6403083/ios-xml-pretty-print <comment286603> It's not the same question. I just want to know if it's possible to turn this setting off (so it stays of by default) in the Safari inspector. Every time I open the inspector, the setting is always turned on, which I don't like.
