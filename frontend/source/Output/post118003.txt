Stream music from iPhone to another phone over Bluetooth <body> Can you send music data from your iPhone to Android with Bluetooth? I've got an Android Phone plug on my stereo and I want to use my iPhone to play music on it.   Is it possible?  <comment137738> As long as android can mimic a bluetooth headset, then the iPhone would see it as a valid music playing destination. Let's see if anyone here knows android or we could see if there is an android site to migrate if you prefer. <comment137742> Thx for your answer !
