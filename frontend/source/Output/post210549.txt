Enhanced Dictation only works in English <body> I'm trying to use dictation in Spanish (Yosemite v10.10.5) but it's not writing any text.  I have downloaded the Spanish Enhanced Dictation bundle, deleted and re-downloaded it, deleted it by hand from code/System/Library/Speech/Recognizers/SpeechRecognitionCoreLanguages/code and purged the file cache using codesudo purge/code with no luck.  Right now it looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/96XQ2.gif" alt="enter image description here"  em(I spoke something to the microphone)/em But when I do the same using English:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WWCkI.gif" alt="enter image description here"  What can I do to enable dictation in Spanish (or any other language)? Does it have to do with the OS language?  Thanks a lot!  <answer211587> Well, I have updated to El Capitan and the error is gone. It looks like a localization file was corrupt.  So, it seems that the solution is "Reinstall or upgrade your OS"
