rsync is creating a folder called Archive under /Volumes instead of copying files to mounted share /Volumes/Archive <body> I am moving data from a Drobo 5D to a NAS (FreeNAS). I am using this command:  precodesudo rsync -a --stats --progress "/Volumes/Drobo 5D" "/Volumes/Archive" /code/pre  Obviously, before I run the command, I mounted the  codeArchive/code volume using Finder (browsed the network, found the server, clicked on the share). However, for some reason, codersync/code is creating a folder under code/Volumes/code called codeArchive/code instead of using the mounted codeArchive/code volume. This is filling my system drive, instead of copying the data to the correct destination.  Here you can see the two codeArchive/code volumes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ckpUM.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's the output of the codemount/code command:  precode/dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, with quotas, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)  /dev/disk1s2 on /Volumes/Macintosh SSD 2 (hfs, local, journaled)  map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)  map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)  map -fstab on /Network/Servers (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)  /dev/disk4s2 on /Volumes/Drobo 5D (hfs, local, journaled)  /dev/disk5s2 on /Volumes/Macintosh iSCSI (hfs, local, journaled)  /dev/disk3s2 on /Volumes/Backup (hfs, local, journaled)  /dev/disk2s2 on /Volumes/Time Machine (hfs, local, journaled)  //Matthew@Megatron._smb._tcp.local/Archive on /Volumes/Archive-1 (smbfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by Admin) /code/pre  Here's the output of the codels -l /Volumes/code command:  precodedrwxr-xr-x+  3 root  wheel    102 Jun 21 22:16 Archive drwx------   1 Admin  staff  16384 Jun 22 08:07 Archive-1  drwxrwxr-x  16 Admin  staff    612 Jun  2 09:43 Backup  drwxrwx---+ 43 root   admin   1530 Jun 22 08:00 Drobo 5D lrwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel      1 Jun 22 08:00 Macintosh SSD -&gt; / drwxrwxr-x  17 Admin  staff    646 Jun 22 08:00 Macintosh SSD 2 drwxrwxr-x  10 root   admin    408 Jun 14 08:19 Macintosh iSCSI drwxrwxr-x  14 Admin  staff    544 Jun  2 09:43 Time Machine /code/pre  Since posting this question, I have wondered if putting the destination path in quotes makes any difference. Commonsense tells me no, but best not to assume such things.  My questions are:  ol liWhy isn't codersync/code using the already mounted codeArchive/code volume?/li liHow do I correctly remove the codeArchive/code folder from the codeVolumes/code folder?/li /ol  <comment363149> It would be useful if you would add to your post the command `mount` and the output. <comment363155> I mounted the volume using Finder (question updated). Is mounting the volume using Finder less effective than mounting using the command line? <comment363157> Not necessarily, `mount` with no options or arguments, just lists the file systems that are mounted. The picture suggests that you may have ghost volumes mounted. <comment363159> I'm not sure what a ghost volume is. I can confirm the Archive volume on the FreeNAS server is mounted and accessible. The Archive folder under Volumes appears to be a local folder. <comment363161> We want to see the mount information as it  gives more information (or at least the same info in one place) than the GUI <comment363163> If you unmount the real Archive volume, delete the erroneous /Volumes/Archive folder and then remount the real Archive volume, then run your `rsync` command, does it work properly?. If not, repeat and use a `/` at the end of the `source` and `destination` volume pathnames. If that fails, add the output of the `mount` command from Terminal to the OP. <comment363169> @user3439894 that is one of my questions - how I do correctly delete the folder? Will Finder work or do I need to delete at command line and if so, what is the appropriate command? <comment363172> Please let us help in helping you. Open Terminal, run `mount` and copy/paste the result into the question (as text). Do the same for `ls -l /Volumes`. <comment363181> @Swisher Sweet, In Terminal, after the real Archive volume has been unmounted: `sudo rm -R /Volumes/Archive` <comment363189> Sorry for the delay; had a production deployment to complete... pesky job. :)
