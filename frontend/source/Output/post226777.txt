Slow (10 mbit) Wi-Fi between AC AirPort Extreme and 2015 MacBook Pro (AC) <body> I'm using speedtest.net to make the measurement. When I'm plugged into the switch using a Thunderbolt-to-Gigabit-Ethernet adapter I get 100/100 mbit consistently (what I pay for), but over Wi-Fi I get 10-20 mbit, whether I'm close to the AirPort Extreme or further away.  I should mention the slow speeds are the same for both my iPhone 6 and iPad Air 2; no more than 10-20 mbit or so.  Here's the MacBook Wi-Fi system information:  precode  Software Versions:   CoreWLAN: 5.0 (500.35.2)   CoreWLANKit:  4.3 (430.38.1)   Menu Extra:   10.3 (1030.34)   System Information:   9.0 (900.9)   IO80211 Family:   7.3 (730.60)   Diagnostics:  4.2 (420.71)   AirPort Utility:  6.3.5 (635.2)   Interfaces: en0:   Card Type:    AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0x133)   Firmware Version: Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (7.15.166.24.3)   MAC Address:  a4:5e:60:eb:b3:e9   Locale:   ETSI   Country Code: DK   Supported PHY Modes:  802.11 a/b/g/n/ac   Supported Channels:   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140, 149, 153, 157, 161   Wake On Wireless: Supported   AirDrop:  Supported   Status:   Connected   Current Network Information: FreeWifi-LOLJustKidding:   PHY Mode: 802.11ac   BSSID:    6c:70:9f:e1:dd:e9   Channel:  36   Country Code: DK   Network Type: Infrastructure   Security: WPA2 Personal   Signal / Noise:   -40 dBm / -92 dBm   Transmit Rate:    1300   MCS Index:    9 /code/pre  Just when I got it I was getting 200/200 mbit consistently. Can an AP just "go bad", or must it be interference (I moved in the mean time)?  Wi-Fi environment information: there are 25 visible 2.4 GHz APs in my apartment currently, while only two 5 GHz APs are visible.  strongEDIT:/strong I created an exclusive 5 GHz network, and connected to this with all my devices, and now my iPhone and iPad both pull 100/100 mbit, but the Macbook still struggles at 60/70 mbit.  <comment277353> Your measurment are still deep down what you should get with 802.11ac which is 500 Mbit/s (which gives a 250 Mbit/s at application level with for example an `scp`). <comment277545> I'm using speedtest.net to test the connection speed, which uses an internet server. So the measurement is capped by my internet connection speed (100/100 mbit). <comment277603> Hence you clearly see why `speedtest.net` isn't appropriate to measure correctly local network performance.
