Non-existing URLs redirect to "searchguide - level 3" in Safari <body> I typed a URL in Safari to check whether a domain name had been registered or not, and was redirected to this page:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUfdu.png" alt="enter image description here"  (here I made the test with "http://fegiuebnfuybzh.com", a random string of letters and a domain I believe no one owns).  The URL I was redirected to is:  precodehttp://searchguide.level3.com/search/?q=http%3A//fegiuebnfuybzh.com/&amp;r=&amp;t=0 /code/pre  I couldn't find much recent information about this website, and I definitely never gave my computer access to this service knowingly.  I can see that the home page has a "settings" link:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OZfFm.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongI do not want this service to be present in my computer at all, even with "off" settings/strong, so this aren't what I'm looking for.  How can I make Safari display the regular "the address couldn't be found" text page, and get rid of this nasty "level 3"?  <answer240114> Investigate whatever your ISP provides to turn off NXDOMAIN redirects.  This has nothing to do with your computer.  <answer240115> You should be able to get back the regular "the address couldn't be found" text page after removing level3.com from the smart search function or completely disabling this feature:  ul liOpen Safari  Preferences  Search  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N6Nnc.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick emManage Websites…/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MTNyG.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liEither remove level3.com or all websites listed/li liOr disable emEnable Quick Website Search/em completely/li liRestart Safari/li /ul  <answer261361> One reason could be that you are using strongLevel3’s DNS servers/strong (4.2.2.1 through 4.2.2.6) which will redirect you to their search engine for any unknown domain name.  Change it back or choose one of Google's public DNS server, for example 8.8.8.8  Found this answer here  <answer285617> The reason why you're being redirected from some non-existing domain address to Level3 Search engine pages can be related to your DNS configuration or your ISP provider settings.  For example when using free DNS servers such as 4.2.2.1 (up to 4.2.2.6), normally they're used to locate the nearest DNS resolvers (especially useful for slow networks). See: What is 4.2.2.2? However please note these IP addresses are strongowned/strong by Level 3's network, so they are basically redirecting you to their own search engine in case the domain is not found, because you're using theirs DNS. If you don't want to be redirected, simply don't use their DNS.  To check which DNS are you using, you can check in code/etc/resolv.conf/code or in emNetwork Preferences/em of your connection.  hr  Here are simple *nix shell command lines to check:  precode$ dig non-existing.domain         ︙ ;; ANSWER SECTION: non-existing.domain.    10  IN  A   104.239.213.7 non-existing.domain.    10  IN  A   198.105.254.11         ︙ $ wget -qO- http://104.239.213.7 &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=http://searchguide.level3.com/search/?q=http://104.239.213.7/&amp;t=0"/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script&gt;window.location="http://searchguide.level3.com/search/?q="+escape(window.location)+"&amp;r="+escape(document.referrer)+"&amp;t=0";&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; /code/pre  So the redirect happens on DNS level by resolving any non-existing domain to Level3 pages.  To find out which DNS is redirecting you to Level3 pages, run this *nix command:  precode$ dig non-existing.domain | grep SERVER ;; SERVER: 4.2.2.1#53(4.2.2.1) /code/pre  If you don't want the redirect to happen, change your free DNS to the one which ISP is providing for your network, or to your local DNS such as gateway/router IP.  Alternatively use different public DNS servers (which doesn't belong to Level3) such as:  ul liGoogle Public DNS: code8.8.8.8/code and code8.8.4.4/code/li liOpenDNS: code208.67.222.222/code and code208.67.220.220/code/li /ul  <comment294805> Think you have a virus. Install [MalwareBytes Anti-Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.org) and run a sweep. <comment294815> Sometimes, ISPs will insert that kind of structure for 'not found' URLs - mine does occasionally, though it didn't for that random URL. [Level3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_3_Communications) is not a suspicious domain in itself, so the redirect may be entirely innocuous. <comment300386> Thanks for the answer! There were indeed websites in this list I hadn't authorized... but no *Level3*. Any idea how websites get added to this list? <comment300387> Thanks! Could you explain how I can investigate your solution? Through the modem's settings? By calling the ISP? <comment330257> This is the correct answer
