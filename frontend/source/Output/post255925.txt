The maximum number of free accounts have been activated on this iPhone <body> I have an problem with sign in into icloud, my iPhone give me alert strong'The maximum number of free accounts have been activated on this iPhone'/strong.  According to this     I cannot open icloud account in my device   It's say I should sign up at other iDevices, but I haven't. I tried to sign up iCloud from windows browser, and it can log in but on my iPhone it can't, it give me the same alert.  Is there others way to fix this problem? or can you help me to signup my iCloud from your iDevices?  <comment318934> One person needs one Apple ID. Maybe an argument could be made for two if you want to have different accounts for the Store versus iCloud. Why do you need more than three (which is the limit per device)? <comment318935> Possible duplicate of [I cannot open icloud account in my device](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/163465/i-cannot-open-icloud-account-in-my-device) <comment318940> My iPhone is second, and last person have sign up this three times
