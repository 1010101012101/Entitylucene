Mounted directory not listing in terminal <body> Normally, I mount a remote drive to a directory on my Mac and it all works fine. I can open, edit and save my files in a text editor and they save back to the server, using the following to perform the mount:  codesshfs root@*.*.*.*:/var/www Documents/AWS/EC2/Linode/code  This morning however, I get the following error:  precodefuse: bad mount point `Documents/AWS/EC2/Linode': Input/output error /code/pre  On the terminal, I listed the content of codeDocuments/AWS/EC2/code and Linode is missing. So, I decide to recreate it but the system complains it already exists.  I'm stumped. Can anyone help, please?  <answer284152> I found a solution based on the following steps:  ul liFind the culprit sshfs process: code$ pgrep -lf sshfs/code/li liKill it: code$ kill -9 &lt;pid_of_sshfs_process&gt;/code/li liForce unmount the "unavailable" directory: codeumount -f Documents/AWS/EC2/Linode/code/li /ul  <comment358319> We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.
