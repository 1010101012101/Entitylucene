Static Flickering When Connecting 2013 Macbook Pro to Pansonic Plasma TV <body> I got an HDMI adapter for Christmas and I've been having a lot of trouble with it. Originally, I plugged it into a rather large Pansonic plasma TV. We tried fiddling with the display settings on the Mac and TV, however we've had no luck. So, we had assumed it was an issue with the adapter. However, we tried it out with the TV upstairs (Not sure what brand/type it is, save that it also has an HDMI port) and it worked perfectly. There were a few dots of static but nothing noticeable unless you were looking for it. So, it must be a problem with the TV, and I am unsure as to what to do to make this work. I've tried cleaning the cable and adapter, both HDMI ports on the TV and adapter, I've tried new cables, I've tried using those little circle things you put onto the HDMI cable to reduce static, I've tried restarting the TV and the laptop, I've tried just about everything, and I am unsure as to what else I can do. Has anyone else had this same problem, and if so, how was it resolved?  <comment333809> What brand of HDMI adapter? I assume you are going from the Thunderbolt/MDP port to the Panasonic TV. I've found that non-Apple (Belkin is the only one Apple sells into their store) HDMI adaptors can have problems ranging from poor signal quality to no signal at all. You can get the Belkin from Amazon rather inexpensively. <comment334413> I'm not entirely sure what brand it is, save that it is an offbrand apple product. That's what we assumed the issue is, but I find it weird it'd work on my other TV and not the other one.
