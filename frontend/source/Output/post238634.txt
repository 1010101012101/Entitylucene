Remove html5test.com website data in Safari Technology Preview <body> I am trying to remove all website data from Safari Technology Preview but after using the "Remove all website data" button the list of websites gets filled with html5test.com and i cannot find the way to remove it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9R8W9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment346063> Have you tried clicking it and pressing Remove? Do you have html5test.com open behind the preferences window? <comment346166> obviously I did try clicking and pressing remove, but it didn't work. the url was not open behind the preferences window. <comment346196> Now it is happening again but with ebay.es (databases)
