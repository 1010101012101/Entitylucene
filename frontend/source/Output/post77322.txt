Can Teleport be set up to be automated? <body> I've got two Macs, and I only use one keyboard and mouse thanks to Teleport. The problem is that I have to activate it every time I turn my computer on. Would it be possible to do it automatically?  <comment89644> I deleted the second question since we allow people to ask questions for free and we prefer one question per question. <comment89645> No problem, I'll ask another question then. <comment89649> Can't you add it to Login Items under Users & Groups? <comment89651> No, because it's not an application. It's a ".prefPane".
