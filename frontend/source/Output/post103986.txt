How to use tabs in Textmate 2 for files opened via Transmit <body> When editing multiple files from Panic's Transmit, in TextMate 1 they'd open themselves in tabs instead of separate windows.  How can I restore that behavior in TextMate 2?  This was the workflow for achieving this in TextMate 1: http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/06/13/use-tabs-in-textmate-for-remote-files-opened-by-transmit/  <answer136961> I had the same question a while back, stumbled across your question, but saw there wasn't an answer. Today, I was frustrated, so set about to figure this out.  http://write.byronrode.com/textmate-2-tabs-and-transmit/ has the answer, which is a bit too detailed for an answer here.  Let me know if it helps.
