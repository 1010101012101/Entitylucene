How do I install Darwin 13 on OS X 10.9.1? <body> I've recently bought a MacBook with OS X 10.9 and I've just updated it to 10.9.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 64-bit).  I'd like to install the version 13 of Darwin.  I've done everything proposed by this website, but when I try to codemake/code xnu, I have this error message:  precodeGenerating libkern/version.h from /Users/xxxx/Downloads/xnu-2422.1.72/libkern/libkern/version.h.template install: target ‘version.h’ is not a directory make[5]: *** [version.h] Error 1 make[4]: *** [build_exporthdrs_mi] Error 2 make[3]: *** [build_exporthdrs_mi_recurse_into_libkern] Error 2 make[2]: *** [build_exporthdrs_mi_recurse_into_libkern] Error 2 make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs.... make[1]: *** [build_exporthdrs_mi_bootstrap_RELEASE^X86_64^NONE] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2 /code/pre  <answer117836> The problem is somewhere with my bash (I've brewed some GNU utils, it is maybe it). So, I've used zsh and the codemake/codecommand compiled great!  <comment137498> Did you try `sudo make`? <comment137503> I've just tried with sudo. I'm getting the same error messages <comment137516> @Tetraodienne, you ***"tried with `sudo`"*** — with `sudo make` or `sudo make ARCH_CONFIGS=X86_64 KERNEL_CONFIGS=RELEASE`? Just to be clear, daviesgeek is stating `sudo make` by itself. Also, ensure you're in the `xnu-2422.1.72` directory to execute the command. <comment137524> @l'L'l I've tried both `sudo make` and `sudo make ARCH_CONFIGS=X86_64 KERNEL_CONFIGS=RELEASE`. And yes, I'm sure I've executed these commands in the `xnu-2422.1.72`directory. <comment137527> @Tetraodienne, Ah good, just making sure. It could be something is amiss with the instructions you're using. One more question, do have the xcode command line tools installed? <comment137545> Ok, so the problem is somewhere with my bash (I've brewed some GNU utils). So, I've used `zsh` and the `make` worked great! <comment165796> This question appears to be off-topic because it is just in the OPs setup and so no use to anyone else <comment171291> @Mark We do have these kind of questions now and then, and while I agree that the case is very specific, the answer (try another shell) might be of value for others running into compile issues of any kind.
