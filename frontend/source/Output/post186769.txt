Where can I get a signed iOS 8.2 .ipsw file for iPhone 4S? <body> Until about a week ago, Apple offered a signed version of iOS 8.2. Now the file is not signed anymore. Is there any place where I can still download the signed version of the file? Does anyone still have a copy?  Background: I'm writing an iOS app that I'd like to test on my iPhone, but my version of Xcode can't handle iOS 8.3. As far as I can tell, there are only two ways of making Xcode compatible with my phone: either upgrade OS X to Yosemite or downgrade iOS to 8.2. I'd rather downgrade the phone, I only use it for testing anyway.  Links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Version_comparison_table https://ipsw.me/iPhone4,1  (Or did I misunderstand the signing process? Maybe the file hasn't changed, and the signing somehow happens during installation?)  strongUPDATE/strong: Yes, I did misunderstand the signing process - during installation, an Apple server has to approve the file for the phone. :-(  But I found another way to make Xcode on Mavericks talk to my iOS 8.3 phone: I downloaded Xcode 6.3 from developer.apple.com, installed it to code/Applications/Xcode-6.3.app/code, and copied code/Applications/Xcode-6.3.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/code to code/Applications/Xcode-6.2.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/code. Started Xcode 6.2, and could run and debug apps on my phone from Xcode. Also works for Xcode 5.0.

After that, there's no way to go back, unless you saved your SHSH blob from the prior version's installation.  You should be able to get Xcode 6.3.1 from Apple Developer or update from the App Store.  <comment220676> Thanks for the answer. Two remarks: 1. As I said, Xcode 6.3.1 requires OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), and I'd rather not upgrade my Mac yet. 2. If I understand correctly, saving SHSH blobs doesn't help anymore. There is no way to downgrade a 8.3 iPhone. There aren't even jailbreaks. More details here: https://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/APTicket https://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/SHSH
