How can I copy a playlist from my iPod to iTunes? <body> I have some playlists which exist on my iPod only; I lost them in iTunes the last time I did a backup.  How can I get these (non-smart) playlists out of the iPod, and restore them to iTunes?  I have a 2nd gen iPod Nano, which I connect via USB to iTunes (v10.6.0.40) on a Windows 7 PC.    <answer45233> There are several applications for doing this:  h2Yamipod/h2  Yamipod is a freeware application that works on Windows, OS X, and Linux.
