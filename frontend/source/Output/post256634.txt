How to use Microsoft Office 2016 behind a proxy? <body> I've just finished a fresh install of Microsoft Office 2016. When I run Microsoft Word, I obtain the start page with different propositions for creating a new document.  But the cursor is a spinning wheel and I can't use the interface. In the Activity Monitor I see codeMicrosoft Word (Not Responding)/code with a CPU usage of about 27%.  What can I do?  P.S.: I'm using OS X 10.11.6 and Microsoft Word for Mac 15.26 (160910)  P.S.2: I'm working behind a proxy  <answer256641> Make sure your internet connection is on. Check the size of the file, see if it matches from where you downloaded. Restart and it probably works.  Source: Experience  <answer256655> The problem is related to the fact I'm working behind a proxy.  After reading this article     Microsoft Office 2016 and proxy URLs.  I've added the following url's:  precodenexus.officeapps.live.com ocos-office365-s2s.msedge.net config.edge.skype.com officeclient.microsoft.com odc.officeapps.live.com store.office.com omextemplates.content.office.net nexusrules.officeapps.live.com templateservice.office.com /code/pre  to the bypass proxy list by going to : codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Advanced... -&gt; Proxies/code and filling the field codeBypass proxy settings for these Hosts &amp; Domains/code  P.S.: the domains must be separated by commas.  == EDIT ==  Today, I tried to refine this list given by the above mentioned article and I discover that Word was still running fine even without the list. Apparently, it's needed only on the first start of the application.  <comment320158> My internet connection is working fine, but I'm behind a proxy. How do I tell this to Microsoft Office? <comment320610> Just setup a proxy for the entire system then it should apply to every thing <comment320778> I've already set a proxy for the entire system. <comment320797> I see no reason for it not to work.
