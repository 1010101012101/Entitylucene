Is it possible to switch between spaces with Command+Number in Lion? <body> In Snow Leopard I could switch spaces by pressing kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdNumber/kbd. Is there a way to turn that on in Lion?  <answer19691> Yes you can. Just changes the shortcut setting in the strongSystem PreferencesKeyboardKeyboard Shortcut/strong. You will find emMission Control/em section for shortcut, and there is entry called emSwitch to Desktop/em.  You could define your own shortcut here.  <comment21626> Thank you very much! Can't believe I didn't find that. Fail question.
