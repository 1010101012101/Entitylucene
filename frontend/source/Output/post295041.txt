Where does Adobe shockwave get installed? <body> I recently installed Adobe shockwave to open a file.  I couldn't seem to find any application (in code/Applications/code) called Shockwave or Adobe Shockwave.  When I installed it, it claimed that it would take 44MB, but the only directory I could find that it installed anything (via spotlight) was code/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/DirectorShockwave.plugin/code.  Are there any other places that this software installed files/directories?  FYI, I'm running OSX 10.12.6.
