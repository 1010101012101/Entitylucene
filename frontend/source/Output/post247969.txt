Screen corruption on Windows and Linux <body> I have a Macbook Air 6.2 (mid 2013). If I install Linux or Windows 10 (native or through Boot Camp) I experience some very disturbing screen flickering or screen corruption.   The problem manifests as short, but frequent corrupted areas of the screen. The corruption is visible less than a second before it is corrected. A corrupted area typically shows as either a horizontal or vertical line, 0.5-3 cm wide. The lines contain black and white bars, not dissimilar to a barcode. Sometimes they also show parts the screen image, torn out of place. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mEcx8.gif" alt="Video clip showing the symptoms."  The problem only occurs when I boot into an operating system other than OS X and if the operating system loads a graphics driver. Rebooting back into OS X makes the problem disappear.   I am able to use Linux without problems if I only use the VESA driver, which is just a generic graphics driver. Similarly, Windows works just fine during the installation or if I do not install the Intel display driver.  The flickers of corruption, seems to occur at random intervals. But I found that it is possible to provoke a flicker on Linux by running "lm-sensors". Which makes me think the error is somehow connected to the way Linux and Windows handles the SMBus.  So far I have tried to reset the SMC and NVRAM. Neither had any effect on the problem.
