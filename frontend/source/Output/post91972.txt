How to create an apple script that forwards a flagged email <body> I want to create an apple script that will forward a flagged email to x@mail.asana.com   I have tried this script:  precodeon run   tell application "Mail"     repeat with _acct in imap accounts         --Look For Flagged Messages in the INBOX         set _acct_name to name of _acct         set _inbox to _acct's mailbox "INBOX"          set _msgs_to_capture to (a reference to ¬             (every message of _inbox ¬                 whose flagged status is true))          repeat with eachMessage in _msgs_to_capture             set theStart to missing value             set theDue to missing value             set theOmniTask to missing value              set theTitle to the subject of eachMessage             set theNotes to the content of eachMessage              set theCombinedBody to "message://%3c" &amp; message id of eachMessage &amp; "%3e" &amp; return &amp; return &amp; theNotes              tell application "OmniFocus"                 tell default document                     set newTaskProps to {name:theTitle}                     if theStart is not missing value then set newTaskProps to newTaskProps &amp; {start date:theStart}                     if theDue is not missing value then set newTaskProps to newTaskProps &amp; {due date:theDue}                     if theCombinedBody is not missing value then set newTaskProps to newTaskProps &amp; {note:theCombinedBody}                      set newTask to make new inbox task with properties newTaskProps                 end tell             end tell              set flagged status of eachMessage to false          end repeat      end repeat end tell  end run /code/pre  However, this script opens OmniFocus instead of just sending an email.  How would I change this script or start with a new one so that it will automatically forward a flagged email to x@mail.asana.com?  <answer128404> Here is some code, with no references to your OmniFocus application, that forwards all flagged messages to a set address. Adjust to your liking....  Works like a charm on my Snow Leopard macbook.  precodeset toAddress to "userx@mail.asana.com" set toName to "User X"  tell application "Mail"     repeat with _acct in imap accounts         --Look For Flagged Messages in the INBOX         set _acct_name to name of _acct         set _inbox to _acct's mailbox "INBOX"         set _msgs_to_capture to (a reference to ¬             (every message of _inbox ¬                 whose flagged status is true))          repeat with _msg in _msgs_to_capture             set _fwdmsg to forward _msg with opening window              tell _fwdmsg                 make new to recipient at end of ¬                     to recipients with properties {name:toName, address:toAddress}             end tell              activate              send _fwdmsg         end repeat     end repeat end tell  /code/pre  <comment107993> Have you tried anything? If so, would you mind including a link, or detailing what you have done? <comment108001> I haven't done anything but some research.  I found these solutions but they open OmniFocus instead of just sending an email: http://www.hanchorllc.com/2011/12/11/omnifocus-task-auto-import-via-ios-mail-flags/  https://github.com/HunterHillegas/OmniFocusMailFlags/blob/master/PushFlaggedMessagesToOmniFocus.applescript
