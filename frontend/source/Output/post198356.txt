Applescript or Shell rename a file? <body> The following is the code I have, however, it doesn't let me choose the extension I want to save it as. How can I save the file as a ".plist" ?  precodedo shell script "echo '{ Filter = { Bundles = ( \"'" &amp; proj &amp; "'\" ); }; }' &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/gametocheat/" &amp; proj &amp; " " /code/pre  <answer198420> You need to use a tool that can write a plist such as codedefaults/code.  precodedefaults write ~/Desktop/gametocheat/my.cheat.preference '{ "Filter" = { "Bundles" = (foo); }; }'; /code/pre  <comment237407> Just add .plist at the end of the file name. Though what you have here is not plist file.
