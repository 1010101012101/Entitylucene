Restart game on iPad ios8 <body> I want to restart Domination on my iPad iOS 8, but whenever I delete the old village is there and I have already removed from iCloud. It's there as a history of downloaded apps. There is a cloud with an arrow whenever I want to install it. Can anyone help?  <comment216704> the game state is possibly on the game maker's servers, not your pad <comment216713> I don't think so. I have the same thing with any app I've ever installed. When I check the AppStore -- Purchased -- Not on this iPad , there are all apps I have ever had and they all have that cloud with the arrow. I would like to get rid all of them. <comment216736> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88089/how-can-i-restart-an-app-game-from-the-beginning?rq=1
