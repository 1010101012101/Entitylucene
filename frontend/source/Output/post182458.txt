How can I download a newer Yosemite installer? <body> I have an existing Yosemite installer app from the original release of 10.10 (e.g. codeInstall OS X Yosemite.app/code) but can't seem to download a newer installer.  When I click Download, I'm presented with this dialog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bh6Ua.jpg" alt="Mac App Store window showing OS X Yosemite and dialog reading &quot;OS X v10.10.3 is already installed on this computer. Use the Updates page to install the 10.10 update or if you would like to download the OS X installer click Continue.&quot;"  However, clicking Continue doesn't appear to do anything.  No update appears to be in progress, no network activity shows in Activity Monitor.  The same dialog appears if I click the Download button in Purchases, and the download never begins.  How can I get an updated installer?  <answer182489> I've seen this happen to a few people - it seems that the system is thinking in doublespeak - believing 2 things at the same time; that you need 10.10.3 but that you already have 10.10.3  Most times, this is resolved by downloading &amp; installing the 10.10.3 combo updater, directly from Apple's Knowledge Base - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804  This will make sure you have all updated components since 10.10.0  <answer183028> The problem appears to have been my copy of the installer that I had stashed away in a folder in my home directory, even though I'd originally made it by keeping a copy of the installer in code/Applications/code (it was even owned by my user account instead of coderoot/code!).  Once I removed that installer, the Mac App Store was happy to start the download for a new one.  <comment217237> Could it be you already have the Installer? if yes move it to another location and try again. <comment217238> In that screen it is a very faint information, it would change the Download to Downloading, and a small spinning circle top left. No further information that it is actually downloading. There would be also a progress bar in the Finder window / Applications. <comment217239> If you have a copy of the Install OS X Yosemite.app bundle anywhere on your computer it will get updated/overwritten if you click Continue.  I moved the Install OS X Yosemite.app bundle that was for 10.10.0 from /Applications to /Temp and downloaded 10.10.2.  It did not create an Install OS X Yosemite.app bundle in /Application as it normally would and I did not  realize it until it was done and couldn't find it.  That is until I saw that the 10.10.0 one in /Temp had been updated.  I was irked as that was my only copy of 10.10.0.  I like keep a copy of each installer but oh well, that's life. <comment217272> @user3439894 - the trick is to move it to another partition, then the system can't 'follow' it. <comment217363> @Buscar웃: I do have a copy of the original 10.10 installer in my home directory, nothing in `/Applications` though.  It's definitely not updating the copy I have in my home directory.  The spinner doesn't appear to signify anything—it disappears when I click another tab in the MAS app and every time I go to Purchases, OS X Yosemite reverts to the Download button. <comment217364> I'll try this.  Thanks. <comment217366> I just tried and successfully downloaded 2 copies (moved the first one out of the Applications folder). It takes me 30 minutes to download. And exited the Installer. <comment217369> Didn't work, unfortunately.  Still same problem. <comment217371> Then I'm not sure what the problem is… what are you actually trying to achieve? A standalone full installer? You would do that from Purchases. <comment217976> Also doesn't work.  I get the same dialog, it switches to a grayed "DOWNLOAD" button, but never actually starts downloading. I have done it both ways before… <comment217978> @Buscar웃: yeah, I've done it before myself with Mavericks.  Don't know what's going on here. <comment217984> I still don't know what exactly you're trying to achieve, nor exactly what you've tried. You really need to explain more. <comment217987> maybe this would work ? http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/60934/46541 <comment218065> Sorry, I wasn't aware the question was unclear.  I have solved the issue since, but I'll update. <comment218125> Ahaah! Yes, unless you move it to another drive, or zip it & trash the original, etc,, the system will keep track of it. <comment249437> A note on the file being on another drive - mine was on another drive. I ejected the drive, restarted the AppStore and could then download it again.
