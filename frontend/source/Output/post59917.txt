How do you get system diagnostic files from OS X? <body> I am trying to debug a crashed (or hanging) app. How do I get the diagnostic files from the crash?  <answer59918> Individual crash reports are stored in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter but there is a system wide log collection tool called sysdiagnose.  Once you start experiencing the issue, hold down the 4 control keys and then press the period "." key. kbdshift/kbd+kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbd./kbd  After about 15 seconds, a Finder window will open with a sysdiagnose file highlighted.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0FLmr.jpg" alt="Once you start experiencing the issue, hold down the &quot;shift&quot;+&quot;control&quot;+&quot;option&quot;+&quot;command&quot; keys and then press the period &quot;.&quot; key."  This shortcut simply executes the codesysdiagnose/code command, so if you are familiar with the terminal and want to pass in a process ID, you can get enhanced debugging information about that specific program. The key shortcut calls the tool with no arguments and captures the basic report only.  <answer87982> h1Apple sysdiagnose/h1  This shell script(on 10.8 and lower) and executable program by the same name on 10.9:   ul ligathers system-wide diagnostic information/li liis integral to OS X Lion and greater/li liis not available as a separate download/li liis not open source (I have asked Apple to make it so)./li /ul  h2Preparing for the keyboard-only approach to sysdiagnose/h2  In Terminal, run the following command.   precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.stackshot.plist /code/pre  ul liif prompted for a password, enter your admin password for the operating system/li lithat's a one-off, no need to repeat the command. /li /ul  Take a written note of the following key chord, you'll need it later:   kbdControl/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd./kbd  h2Diagnosis by the system/h2  When an issue occurs:   ol liuse the key chord/li lifor at least ten seconds, touch nothing/li liallow maybe five or ten minutes for all parts of the codesysdiagnose/code routine to complete – simply wait as long as you can (there'll be no on-screen indication of progress)/li liFinder should open a window to the end result. /li /ol  h3Exceptionally/h3  In rare cases, an issue may prevent sysdiagnose from completing (I have made improvement suggestions to Apple).

Whilst I don't encourage carelessness, you can be a little careless with kbdControl/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd./kbd … if you struggle to avoid the kbdfn/kbd key on your laptop, don't worry; including it by accident should not prevent the run of codesysdiagnose/code.   hr  h2Human analysis of diagnosis by the system/h2  Hint: someone might like to ask a separate question about analysing the results of codesysdiagnose/code – a more generalised answer could be useful.   h3If sysdiagnose_… from the code/tmp/code area is a file/h3  Presence of a codesysdiagnose_….tar.gz/code file indicates that all parts of the codesysdiagnose/code routine completed, and that the results were archived.

In [my answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87982/8546), the `launchctl` command will start the daemon. <comment104492> excellent answer, thank you very much!! <comment104494> is the `sysdiagnose` command also available in OS 10.6? I don't find a man page and `which sysdiagnose` returns nothing in OS 10.6.8, or do I have to install it explicitely? <comment110392> @Martin my answer is edited to address your question. <comment114925> → Graham: this is a + day: something to learn! I think this kind of tool would benefit all sysadmins input if it was open source. <comment185084> The response to @Martin indicated an edited answer, but what I find is the phrase (on 10.8 or lower), and I can't find 'sysdiagnose' on 10.6 either. <comment189848> → Martin: if you still have a 10.6 (I don't), could you please open a `Terminal` or `xterm` and enter the following commands: `type sysdiagnose ; ls -al /usr/bin/sysdiagnose`, to test for its availability.
