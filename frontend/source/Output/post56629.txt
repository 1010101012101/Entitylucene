Printing source code with OS X <body> How can I print source code in OS X (HTML/PHP) with number lines and without long line truncation? I was used to Gedit on Linux, but here it seems I can't obtain the same with applications such as TextWrangler or TextEdit.  <answer56644> You can print source code with line numbers and without truncation in TextWrangler, the key is strongSoft wrap text/strong.  ol liTurn on "Soft Wrap Text" under Text Options. /li liOpen TextWrangler  Preferences/li liSelect "Text Printing" then check the "Print line numbers" checkbox./li liPrint again, long lines should wrap and line numbers should be present./li /ol  emNote: you may want to set up "Editor Defaults" in TextWrangler's Preferences, and have it Soft wrap text for you for each file you edit, and to a specified width too./em   <answer57285> codeenscript/code in Terminal might be another option. Start with  precodeenscript -CG2rE -U2 my-source-file.PHP /code/pre  and read the (extensive) man page for additional features.  <answer57286> Have you looked at GeSHi? http://qbnz.com/highlighter/demo.php  You didn't specify the purpose for printing out - but I use this to "prettify" any code I expect to be printed - it does line numbering and syntax highlighting for a wide range of languages.  Hope this helps!  <answer282180> strongTextWranger/strong is the best on Mac OS when it come to printing out source code.   strongStep 1/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5PoI.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongStep 2/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vbofe.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongStep 3/strong  Then, there is one more settings, click on gear icon on the top left  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TBxvv.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongAmazing Result/strong  emColor, Line numbers, just neat and clean .../em   Here is a screen of my PDF to show to you guys   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y4eR9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Enjoy !!!
