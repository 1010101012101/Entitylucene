Missing some snooze button options in 10.9 <body> I recently upgraded to 10.9 and was pleased to learn that there are now more snooze optionsâ€¦ in theory. When I do a long click on the snooze button for a calendar alert, I get more options, but mine are limited to 1 min, 5min, until 1 min before event, until 5 min before event, until start of event, and until end of event.  While these are all useful, I would also like to have longer delays (like 30 min, 1hr, 2hr, 1 day), which I use must more frequently. From various articles, it sounds like these should all be options, but they are not for me. Is there something I can set or reset to get these?  <comment126930> Further clarification: It seems that the snooze options are limited to times up until the event (so if I set a notification for 1 hour prior to the event, I can snooze for 1, 5, 15, 30 minutes).  If I set an alert at the time of the event, I do get a full range of options beyond. So I suppose this is just how it is designed to be, just not what I expected, or quite how I want it...
