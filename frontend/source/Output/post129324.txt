Does using albums to combine events keep the events intact? <body> If I use albums in iPhoto to combine events for a slideshow will the album keep each event intact and in order rather than combining pictures by date or some other hierarchy?  <answer129330> strongAlbums don't affect the contents of an event in any way/strong, so your events will remain exactly how you left them.  <comment151363> Are you asking if the sort order of an album that consists of photos from multiple events will group by events first before sorting?
