External Hard Drive freezes computer <body> My friend just called me up and said he purchased a new Seagate 3 TB External harddrive for his Mac Book Pro. And ever since he connected the harddrive, his computer was not able to run.  After initially connecting the harddrive to his computer, the computer froze. And when proceeding to reboot, all he sees is a circular cursor (different from the colorful spinning one). The computer still refuses to load despite numerous reboots. He can't even get to the log in screen, all he sees is the circular cursor. What exactly is the problem and how can we revert his computer back to normal?  <comment115891> see this question and answers that might solve your problem http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/96696/new-seagate-hard-drive-freezes-macbook-pro <comment115892> The problem is slightly different though. My friend can't even get to the login screen and what cause the problem was the external <comment115893> Let's try to isolate the issue. What happens if the external drive gets connected to a different computer? Did you try with a different cable? What happens if you boot with the external drive connected but turned off and only turn it in once a user is logged in? <comment115903> Right now, the laptop doesn't even boot fully, regardless if the hard drive is connected or not. It doesn't even go to the login screen. Have yet to try booting with the HDD connected and off. The thing that bothers me the most is that the HDD isn't even connected anymore and the computer won't load.
