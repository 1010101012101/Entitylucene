XCode update is not being reflected <body> I have downloaded the latest Xcode 7.2 from the App Store.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMbEw.png" alt="enter image description here"  But when I open Xcode, it still show the version as 6.4.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y3C5t.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am running on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  How do I use Xcode version 7 and above?  <answer222387> Unfortunately, I got the same problem some times ago, when, after upgrading to El Capitan, I couldn't update to Xcode 7.1.1.  To solve this issue, I did the following:  ol liRemove the .app file in your Application folder (if you prefer, you can use apps like CleanMyMac to remove any other related files);/li liGo to Downloads for Apple Developers (after having logged in) and download Xcode 7.2 directly from there./li /ol  Don't know exactly why the normal update doesn't work, but now, after re-installing the app completely, everything works fine for me (also the new updates from the App store).
