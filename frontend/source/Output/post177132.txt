How to set ⌘ + H to enable show hidden files <body> I want my Mac to show hidden files when i hit ⌘ + H (like ubuntu). I can see hidden files by putting this codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code command in terminal but i want to get a keyboard shortcut for it. Also, if ⌘ + H is already used by some other process please let me know what might be the closest and most related shortcut for this new process and how to assign it to the respective, show hidden files process.   <answer177138> kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd H /kbd is the system-wide shortcut for "Hide frontmost app"  To try tie a new shortcut to that, you could maybe use Automator to add a Service - but I still don't know how you would persuade it to override the existing System default.  This works as a Service if you use a non-system key, but not with kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd H /kbd  precodeon run {input, parameters}      set newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES"     try         set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"         if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then             set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"         end if     end try     do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState       tell application "Finder"         set theWindows to every Finder window         repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows             set this_item to item i of theWindows             set theView to current view of this_item             if theView is list view then                 set current view of this_item to icon view             else                 set current view of this_item to list view              end if             set current view of this_item to theView         end repeat     end tell      return input end run /code/pre  strongEdit for El Capitan…/strongbr I've noticed that the Finder window refresh no longer works in El Capitan, so this is a modified version, quitting the Finder instead.  precodeon run {input, parameters}           --Toggle Invisibles, El Capitan Version      set newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES" try     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState &amp; "; killall Finder" end run /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vv6dr.png" alt="enter image description here"  I guess you could make it work for the Finder only, if you specified some other key command for Hide Finder - as it is visible as a Menu item it would be possible to override for that app alone [by putting something 'useless' as an alternative], leaving you free to then use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd H /kbd to toggle invisibles from the Finder only.  emTested - does work this way/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOaNY.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hamde.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer282811> This might be a new feature, but on Sierra, kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbdShift ⇧/kbd kbd . /kbd will toggle hidden file display in the finder.  <comment209383> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/168540/show-hide-hidden-files-without-restarting-finder might help here <comment209396> The source code does not work as written in Automator under OS X 10.8.5. without modifying and adding `killall Finder`.  In other words just refreshing the Finder windows doesn't show the hidden files/folders when `AppleShowAllFiles` is set to `YES`.  I did test the source code, as is, in Automator under OS X 10.10.2 and it does work as written.  Any way to make it work in OS X 10.8.5 without resorting to `killall Finder`? <comment209397> Might possibly be OS 10.9 is the earliest you can change the view without restarting the Finder. You can make the Finder Quit by Applescript, - lose the entire 'tell application "Finder" ' part right to the 'end tell' & just replace with tell 'application "Finder" to quit' <comment209398> Yeah, however even though you can programmatically gracefully quit/open Finder it doesn't reopen opened Finder windows like "killall Finder" does.  Thanks though for the script, I'll use it under OS X 10.10.x. in my virtual machine.  Still using OS X 10.8.5 as my primary. <comment209404> It used to for me - though I don't have the old version any more where I used to quit Finder to do this - haven't used 10.8 in quite some time. hm… I remember I had a routine to make sure it has restarted, but don't remember the details any more <comment356421> This only works for file open/save sheets, not Finder windows in general. (It's been in macOS for many years.) <comment356615> Like I said, it might be a new feature. I'm running Sierra on my work computer and it works perfectly in an ordinary Finder window. But only in list mode and that multi-column mode; not in icon mode. <comment356627> Sure, I didn’t downvote but it’s not working for me in the latest Sierra beta except in file sheets, do you have TotalFinder or such? <comment367490> *This might be a new feature, but on Sierra, Cmd ⌘ Shift ⇧ . will toggle hidden file display in the finder.* this worked for me i just had to be in finder and it works ! i tried to give you reputation but i cant ! thanks mate !
