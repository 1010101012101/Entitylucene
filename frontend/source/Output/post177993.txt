Unknown item "Nike + ipod" in Settings <body> I wish to know what the purpose of item "Nike + ipod" is in the Settings app on my iPhone?  <answer178056> It's ready for you to connect to a Nike exercise wristband.br It's a core structure &amp; can't be deleted. It's been there since about iOS 4/5.  If you update to iOS 8.2 you'll find there's a new app too, ready to connect to your shiny new Apple Watch… if you ever think of buying one…. again, a core app, can't be deleted.
