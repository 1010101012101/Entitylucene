How to keep sound from muting while using dictation? <body> Whenever I try to use the dictation feature in OSX, it mutes my sound. I want to hear the audio I'm playing in iTunes or somewhere else while I have dictation enabled. How can I do that?  <answer123268> You need to set some hidden preferences to make this work (OS X 10.9 - Mavericks). Open Terminal and enter the two commands below:  precodedefaults write com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore AllowAudioDucking -bool NO defaults write com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs DictationIMAllowAudioDucking -bool NO /code/pre  After doing this turn off dictation in Systems Preferences, wait a few seconds and then re-enable it. You should now be able to dictate while audio is playing. I’ve only tried this while using a headset/headphones, it’s probably not advisable without. :)  To restore your system to it’s virginal state, run these commands in Terminal and then restart dictation:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore AllowAudioDucking defaults delete com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs DictationIMAllowAudioDucking /code/pre  Found via: https://gist.github.com/rmangino/8388849  <answer141914> The program Audio Hijack Pro can handle this.   Add system audio on right, then press hijack 1st and mute 2nd.   <answer287619> This preference was made visible in System Preferences, so you don't need to run Terminal commands any more. Go to the strongAccessibility/strong preference pane, choose strongDictation/strong and disable strongMute audio output while dictating/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pTDht.png" alt=""  <comment130487> I had completely the opposite reaction to this feature - so useful :) <comment130488> I have some really bad audio of speech and I want to "transcribe" it using my own voice and dictation. In other words, I want to listen to the audio and repeat the words in it clearly while dictation types it out for me. <comment130768> Does this also happen when you have headphones connected? Or just when sound playback is through the loudspeakers? <comment130984> I only know it happens when my headphones are connected. <comment146154> with iTunes, Dictation only pauses the sound, and continues wherefrom it left, while other players are just muted and are playing in background, which is meaningless. but the way Dictation works with itunes is very meaningful: the idea is to use it to transcribe what you hear, and dictating is for most people possible only when the sound they hear is paused
