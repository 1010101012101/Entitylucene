How can I enable pinch to zoom in Finder on OS X Lion? <body> After upgrading to Lion the pinch-to-zoom seems to be gone in Finder.  Didn't even find an option for it in system preferences. Any ideas?  <answer20498> The preference for this used to be located in FinderPreferences. It's no longer available and after some research online, it looks like no one has discovered a way to turn this on using a plist edit.   You might consider telling Apple about how much you miss this: http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html  <comment23046> that's what i thought, submitted a comment.  thanks.
