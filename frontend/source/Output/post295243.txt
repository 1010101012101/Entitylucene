Spelling out proper names with dictation <body> I use the dictation feature on my MacBook quite a lot in my job. However, I often have to include proper names that are from foreign languages. Is there a trick that I can use to spell out those names or teach them to the dictation software?   Incidentally, does correcting the words that are underlined in blue improve the recognition?
