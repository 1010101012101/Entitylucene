Is there an iPad app like Snagit for marking up screenshots or pictures with arrows, callouts, dropshadows, torn edges, etc.? <body> I LOVE Snagit.  I know that captures can only be done in iOS with the built in Home-Power screenshot function.  But I'm looking for an app that will allow me to edit those shots and add arrows, shadows, edges, callouts, blur, freehand circles, etc.  Is there something that does this well, with a emfocus on annotation/em?  (So I get that I can do this in Keynote an other apps, but since they're not made for it, it's painful, they can't export the picture back to the photo roll, etc.)  <answer1412> I've been using a combination of Pages, PS Express and Strip Design.  They each have unique features.  It would be nice to have an all in one app that did it all.  <answer39737> I you are looking mainly for annotation then Skitch could be worth a look.br It lacks the more fancy features you asked for (torn edges, blur, etc.) but for basic annotation (arrows, text, freehand) it is quite good.br Although it was acquired by Evernote it is possible to save the annotated image back to the camera roll.  <answer194659> I was using Grafik Note, this is designed for iPad  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHgFB.jpg" alt="image"  ul liImport photo from gallery or by camera/li liDrawing line, segment with/without arrow./li liDrawing free curve with/without arrow./li liDrawing outlined/filled rectangle, oval, round rectangle./li liHighlight color./li liFree text./li liDrawing speech bubble with rectangle/oval/ round rect/li liEnable to change outline and fill color, editable dash style, enable to change line width/li liEnable styling text color, font, size and alignment./li liFile manager which supports create folder/rename/copy/paste/move./li liSharing your annotation photo with the world via email, Facebook, Twitter .../li /ul
