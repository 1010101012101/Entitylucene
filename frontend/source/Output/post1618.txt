How can I set a default zoom level in Safari? <body> I've got a Mac Mini that I'm using as a Home Theatre PC, and my only real complaint is that I can't set a default zoom level in Safari. It's hard to read all that tiny text from 7 feet away from my TV set, so I'm always zooming in.  So: is there some extension or hidden hack way to force Safari to zoom in automatically?  <answer1620> According to this post from Apple's Safari Support discussion forum:     1) Create a file named defaultzoom.css (or any name you like, just strongmake sure it has a css extension/strong.)      2) Copy and paste in the following:    precode    body {         zoom: 130%;       } /code/pre      change 130 to whatever number suits you. code&gt;100/code means strongzoom in/strong, code&lt;100/code means strongzoom out/strong. Don't forget the % percent sign!      3) In safari, go to codePreferences &gt; Advanced/code. Under style sheet, select Other... and point to the file you created.      4) You may need to restart safari for the change to take effect.   hr  [In the above, both the emphasis and code formatting (for non-code-related text) were added to the original quote by Am1rr3zA].  <answer3290> There is a wonderful safari extension, SafariMagnifier, which can set default zoom-in scale for every page.   http://www.wannseii.com/safarimagnifier/  <answer25617> As Am1rr3zA mentioned, you can select a custom style sheet from the preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X9lJz.png" alt=""  I have added these rules to my safari.css file:  precodehtml {     zoom: 125%; } img {     zoom: 75%; } @media print {     html {         zoom: 100%;     } } /code/pre  It has a lot of annoying side-effects though. But ZoomBySite and AllPagesZoom have the same side-effects, and there is also a noticeable delay before AllPagesZoom changes the zoom level.  <answer52248> h1All Pages Zoom/h1  ...allows to "easily set one zoom level for all websites and have it remembered." I'm using it in Safari 5.1.7.  You can download it from Apple's extension gallery under productivity or directly from the developer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Feq8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer166381> If you go to "preferences" in the Safari tab and then to "advanced" you can click the "Never use font sizes smaller than" button and then pick the font size you want.  Then you won't have to squint and get real close to the screen to read it anymore.  <answer253626> After 6 years, we finally have this feature in native Safari 10, so no more CSS or extension required (I used to apply CSS, but it broke many sites as pointed out by @adib):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uoWkS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment27445> Unfortunately the link is dead. <comment28372> I can verify that this works in Safari 5.1 under Lion.  I didn't even have to restart; it immediately took affect on the page I was viewing. <comment53306> Iâ€™d replace `body` with `html`, as the `html` element can be styled too. <comment67543> There's a small delay before the zoom level is applied though. And it breaks a lot of websites like setting a zoom level in CSS. <comment162806> @Armentage Same for Safari 7.0.5 under Mavericks. <comment174877> The "default CSS" and  "All Pages Zoom plugin" methods breaks a good number of sites, most notably Apple's own Developer Member Center site. For example I've set the default to be zoomed out (75% for CSS or 80% for All Pages Zoom) and the  site doesn't fill the screen.
