How to get the content of a Resource Fork? <body> I want to get the stored resource fork. In PHP, I'm trying to: code system('DeRez' . $_icon . ' | perl -ne \'m|/\* (.*) \*/| &amp;&amp; print $1; END {print "\n"}\', $content); /code  which in Terminal really returns the content of the icon. However, creating an image from it using codeimagecreatefromstring/code returns an error.  So, there's a command-line voodoo that outputs the raw data of the resource fork (in my case, the folder icon)?  <answer136862> The icon encoded within the resource fork is not in a format PHP's imagecreatefromstring can understand.  PHP's codeimagecreatefromstring/code requires:  ul liJPEG/li liPNG/li liGIF/li liWBMP/li liGD2/li /ul  h2Use sips/h2  Investigate the Mac OS X command sips for working with icons on the command line. See Manipulate Mac OS X file icons from Automator or command-line for examples.  h2DeRez/h2  The codeDeRez/code command will output the raw resource fork data. The manual for DeRez provides options for filtering the output data and requesting specific encoding; be aware that the encoding options are limited to how the hexadecimal is escaped. Rather than allowing for graphic format conversion.
