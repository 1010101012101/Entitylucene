Office for Mac buy from Sweden <body> I am interested in buying Office for Mac 2011. I am in Sweden. Whenever I want to buy it from a website it shows like strongOffice för Mac Hem och Student 2011 - 1 Paket (Svenska)/strong. Does it means software language is Swedish? I want it in English, as I am not Swedish. And my MacBook Pro (OS X Lion) language is English. Should I buy this one?  <answer55947> Have you tried buying the US English version directly from Microsoft's website (link)? It's a download (no disc).  <answer55949> This is not a problem. What matters is the strongserial/strong.  The emsame serial should work with any language version/em of Office Mac 2011 which you can download from Microsoft's official websites.  I had a similar problem like you. I had purchased an English version via Ebay,  but I needed a German one. I downloaded the German version and used it with and US version serial without any problems.   In your case you can download the US version here: www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads  <comment64228> Office for mac isn't at all like the windows counterpart (it's kinda sketchy tbh)… i know this is kind of off topic, but i HIGHLY suggest you try office for mac and iWork and see which you like more first <comment64230> @XAleXOwnZX What do you mean "sketchy"? I have Office: Mac 2011 on several Macs and I usually prefer it to the Windows version. <comment64253> the ui is inconsistent and often total different from what people expect after using windows' version
