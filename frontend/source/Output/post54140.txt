Which version of iOS is the May 12 security paper referring to? <body> Apple has published a paper on security controls in iOS, which specific version is this referring to?   <answer54143> I would hazard a guess by saying iOS 5, simply because of the date.  <answer54144> The given information seems pretty generic to me. A statement of how Apple manages security with the iOS devices seems more plausible rather than how security is handled with a specific version of it.  strongiOS 5/strong is referred a couple of times in the paper, though, while no earlier version are, but in a very vague way.
