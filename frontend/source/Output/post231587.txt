What’s the Java Shebang for OS X? <body> I just started using TextWrangler in place of Eclipse for writing Java programs. I found a script for testing Java programs in Terminal, but I’d like to handle everything right through TextWrangler. What’s the Java shebang for OS X? Or is there a Java shebang which is specifically for TextWrangler?   <answer231588> The java executable is /usr/bin/java  So shebang is  precode#! /usr/bin/java /code/pre  However a java program is usually in more than one java file and so you need a build system e.g. ant, gradle, maven, sbt .......  If you are just learning and not doing a full release to other users I would stick to Eclipse (or another IDE e.g. Intellij) which can also package for other users  <answer280258> Here is a simple Java shebang that works on OS X and Linux:  precode# /* ------- build and run wrapper script for Java ----------------------------- TMP=$(mktemp -d) tail -c +3 ${0} &gt; ${TMP}/$(basename ${0}) cd ${TMP} &amp;&amp; javac $(basename ${0}) &amp;&amp; java $(basename ${0%.*}) ${@:1} RV=${?} ; cd - &gt; /dev/null ; rm -rf ${TMP} exit ${RV} ------------ https://github.com/d99kris/buildnrun --------------------------- */  public class example {     public static void main(String[] args) {         System.out.println("Hello world");     } } /code/pre  From buildnrun which also has examples for other languages.  <comment282815> I tried that, but I got this result: Error: Could not find or load main class .Users.jfblagden.Desktop.PiesTest.java <comment282817> The command line gets more cpomplex thus learn a build system or stick with Eclipse. you can get this one file to work with parameters to the shebang but not really worth it easier to write a shell script to call java <comment352676> This is no shebang. <comment352701> @MaxRied technically yes but it is a shell file I think not on mac currently.
