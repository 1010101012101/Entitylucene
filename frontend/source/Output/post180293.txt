Tell last media player to skip song <body> I bought a new keyboard that, of course, works almost perfectly, minus the media buttons. Luckily it has open source drivers specifically for linux and mac, but unfortunately the media buttons (specifically the next/previous) do not work.  I have the ability to run a command when they are pressed; I was hoping to recreate the Apple Keyboard next/previous functionality where it skips the song of the emmost recent/em media player.  I've found several scripts that will skip iTunes or Spotify individually, but I have music in both that I like to listen to.  How would I tell the last played media player codenext track/code?  <answer203104> Unfortunately Applescript does not offer a way to get a list of applications ordered by when they were last used - like when you press CMD-Tab.  strongemFortunately/em/strong, somebody found a bit of Objective-C code that does get that information. I've wrapped it up and created this little command link tool that prints all the applications in order.  Now it is easy, a matter of calling it like this...  codeset zorder to (do shell script "/some/path/applist")/code  It produces a list of the applications' PID and their bundle identifier...  precode78540 com.apple.Terminal 68976 com.apple.ScriptEditor2 89228 org.mozilla.firefox 80897 com.barebones.textwrangler 1627 com.apple.finder 84894 com.azureus.vuze 54490 com.transtex.texeditplus 55055 com.apple.Dictionary 54549 com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX /code/pre  The list should be just the apps visible when you press CMD-Tab and in the order displayed.  The rest should now be straight forward....  PS: This code compiled and run correctly on Snow Leopard (10.6), I don't know how/if it will run on newer versions...
