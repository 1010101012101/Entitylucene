How do I use Image Capture to wirelessly scan to my Mac OS X? <body> How do I use Image Capture to wirelessly scan from Brother MFC-490cw flatbed to my Mac OS X?  I go to Image Capture and get an Overview scan, but then cannot actually scan the image next.  Wher  <answer79959> To the right of the scan overview, there should be a pop-up list named emAuto Selection/em. If it's set to emoff/em, then you should either select an option from there or select which part of the overview image to be scanned yourself by clicking and selecting the image.
