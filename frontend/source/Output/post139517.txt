How to have Safari play again Flash videos? <body> Safari has suddenly stopped to load Flash videos.   On YouTube, for instance : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJENlHEZi18    On another site too.   In place of the video, I just have a black rectangle.   In Activity Monitor, I do not see any Flash plug-in process.   So I guess the bug is in Safari.   Anyway, I did clear the Flash data in the System Prefs. To no avail.  It was working yesterday. Now it is broken. I did not change the prefs. I did not quit Safari.  This random bug is really annoying. I have reported it to Apple.  In the meantime, how can I have Safari load Flash videos again ?  Thank you.  I have Safari 5.1.10 on Mac OS X 10.6.8.  <answer139523> emOne solution :/em  strongKill the process emSafari Web Content/em./strong emWarning :/em In all pages, you will lose all the data you may have entered.  emExplanation :/em  The process emSafari Web Content/em has just been killed without human intervention. And Safari reloads all the pages. This is a bug in Safari. It happens from time to time, when many pages are loaded, it is a kind of process apoptosis. Now, I have the Flash Player plug-in process running, and Safari loads the Flash videos. :-)   emConfirmation :/em   The bug has occurred again. This time, I have killed the process emSafari Web Content/em myself. This solution works.  [Edited : Confirmation of the solution]  <comment165091> This bug occurs often now ! <comment280628> This bug occurs also with Firefox. How can I have Firefox play again Flash videos?
