No Keys Repeating on New MacBook Pro After Changing Key Repeat Speed <body> I just opened my new Retina Display MacBook Pro and everything worked fine, but when I tried to go into System Preferences to make the key repeat speed faster, none of the keys repeated, not even numbers and symbols.  If I type codedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false/code into terminal, it works, but it disables the accented key popup when holding down keys such as kbdA/kbd and kbdE/kbd, which I use often.  This worked perfectly on my old 2009 MacBook Pro that was running 10.7.4.  I have restarted this computer and reset the key repeat speed, but have still had no luck.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   <answer64289> It probably wouldn't help, but you could try changing the keys directly in code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code or code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences.*.plist/code.  precodedefaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 2 defaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 15 defaults -currentHost write -g KeyRepeat -int 2 defaults -currentHost write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 15 /code/pre  2 and 15 are the fastest settings shown in System Preferences. The changes aren't applied until you log out and back in.  The file in the ByHost folder doesn't normally have keys for the settings, but it has precedence over the normal .GlobalPreferences.plist.  You can remove the keys with the delete subcommand:  precodedefaults delete -g KeyRepeat defaults delete -g InitialKeyRepeat defaults -currentHost delete -g KeyRepeat defaults -currentHost delete -g InitialKeyRepeat /code/pre  <comment67678> I have the same issue and I tried changing both repeat speed and delay until repeat speed.
