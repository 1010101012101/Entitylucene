How can I transfer my Microsoft Office Install to another Mac? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What is the best way to move Microsoft Office 2011 to a new Mac?       I'm planning on reinstalling Mac OS Lion, but I don't have the MS Office install file or disk. Can I move my installed copy of Office to a USB drive and then back, or to another machine?  <answer33650> moving it to a USB will most likely not work, however if you've got the license key you can go on the office website http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads and download the installer.   <answer33651> You can try to move the main folders to an external drive:  ul li/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/li li/Applications/Microsoft Messenger.app/li li/Applications/Microsoft Communicator.app/li li/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/li li/Users/username/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/li li/username/Documents/Microsoft-Userdata/li /ul  Copy these Folders to the same path on your new system.  <comment38388> Are you currently using MS Office in Snow Leopard? <comment38391> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26019/what-is-the-best-way-to-move-microsoft-office-2011-to-a-new-mac.
