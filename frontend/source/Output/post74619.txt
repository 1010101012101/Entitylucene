Alternative to APLAY for Mac OS X bash <body> Anybody knows any Mac alternative for Linux's APLAY program? I would like to run this script:  precodeecho "main(i){for(i=0;;i++)putchar(((i*(i&gt;&gt;8|i&gt;&gt;9)&amp;46&amp;i&gt;&gt;8))^(i&amp;i&gt;&gt;13|i&gt;&gt;6));}" | gcc -x c - &amp;&amp; ./a.out | aplay /code/pre  Which makes great sound effect, but I don't know how, since Mac OS doesn't have strongaplay/strong.  strongEDIT:/strong  Link to Wikipedia, which describes the functionality of aplay.  <answer74637> codeaplay/code needs ALSA which is only available on Linux. You could try outputting that bytestream to a file and try to play with codeafplay/code on OS X. (You likely need to add proper AIFF headers for codeafplay/code to accept the file since it won't play a raw PCM dump (or however that bytestream coming out of that echo should be interpreted).)  <answer74670> I believe the sox utility stands in for aplay.  <answer88785> Here is the same program, as a perl one-liner, which works (tested) on Mac, Linux, and Windows  precodeperl -e 'for($i=0;;$i++){     print pack("n", ((($i*($i&gt;&gt;8|$i&gt;&gt;9)&amp;46&amp;$i&gt;&gt;8))^($i&amp;$i&gt;&gt;13|$i&gt;&gt;6)));  }' | ./play -c 2 -b 8 -e unsigned -t raw -r 48k - /code/pre  the "./play" command is the "sox" utility already mentioned in this article.  <answer294201> br I know that this topic is old, but I've find a recent working solution. SOX doesn't support input from stdout anymore so now a working alternative is codemplayer/code. You'll need to install it using Hombrew.sh with codebrew install mplayer/code.   You can then replace codeaplay/code by: codemplayer -cache 1024 -quiet -rawaudio samplesize=1:channels=1:rate=8000 -demuxer rawaudio -/code  Just be sure to change coderate=8000/code with your custom frequency.  You can create an alias in code~/.bashrc/code for aplay to pipe your PCM chiptune in like this:  codealias aplay="mplayer -cache 1024 -quiet -rawaudio samplesize=1:channels=1:rate=8000 -demuxer rawaudio -"/code  Hope this helped, tested on macOs Sierra 10.12.5 today.  <comment86654> What does aplay do? <comment86656> See edit, linked url. <comment86668> The fun part about the aplay and this little C algorithm is that it changes and generates different sounds over time, so outputting it would take that away :( <comment86670> See it as a longer time delay for buffering playback. :-) how is that data to be interpreted? That might help to find a suitable command line utility that works on OS X to play the data generated by the utility. (For example that might work with mpg123 though I haven't tried that yet.) <comment86695> So what would you suggest? <comment373470> aplay uses 8khz not 48... so the command should rather be `play -c 1 -b 8 -e unsigned -t raw -r 8k -`
