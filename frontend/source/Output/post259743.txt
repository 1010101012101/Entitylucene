Disk Utility can't find free space and Recovery Mode can't resize <body> I had Linux installed on my Macbook in dual boot with MacOS.   Today, I uninstalled Linux, so I erased the partitions on which it was installed from Internet Recovery Mode. But, now, when I want to resize my Mac partition to its original size (250GB) ( now it is 200GB, Linux had 50GB in total) one of these 2 things will happen:  ol liIf I try to resize it from inside the OS, in Disk Utility, it won't find any free space. It will show that I have 200GB available (my current partition) which is not true./li liIn Recovery Mode, I am able to see the free space of 50GB but I can't add it to my current partition, nor can I format it as another partition. It would get stuck on "Preparing to partition disk"./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZvEu.png" alt="enter image description here" disk0s2 is the Recovery partition. Don't ask me why it's name is FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DgjvS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Please, tell me that the solution is not to re-install/format everything. Thanks!

To salvage this you just have to rewrite the GUID partition table:  ul liBoot to Internet Recovery Mode/li liOpen Terminal in the menubar  Utilities  Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil list/code and with the disk identifier of the internal disk found there: codegpt -r show diskX/code. Usually it's disk0 - below I assume it's disk0. Use the disk identifier you have found in your environment in the commands below!/li liUnmount the internal disk:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre/li liRemove all partitions:  precodegpt remove -i 1 /dev/disk0  gpt remove -i 2 /dev/disk0  /code/pre/li liRe-add all partitions:  precodegpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk0 gpt add -b 391759648 -i 3 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0 gpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 391350008 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0        /code/pre/li liVerify disk and main volume and repair it if necessary:  precodediskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk0 diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk0s2 /code/pre/li liResize the main volume:  precodediskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 100% #or 250g /code/pre/li liReboot to your main volume/li /ul  <comment324999> Did you boot to Recovery Mode (which shouldn't be possible) or to Internet Recovery Mode? Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show disk0`! Your EFI partition is also missing! <comment325073> @klanomath Sorry, Internet Recovery mode. I edited the post with the output.
