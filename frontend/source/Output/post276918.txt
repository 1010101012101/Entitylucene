Why KeyRemap4MacBook mapping for home-end stopped working in browsers after migrating to Sierra from Mavericks? <body> This mapping is still working in MS Word and vi.br Also    Option-Tab stopped working for switching applications.  <answer276921> Karabiner (the new name for this software) doesn't work on Sierra.  On the developer's site it states     strongmacOS Sierra support status/strong      Karabiner does not work on macOS Sierra at the moment.      We are developing Karabiner-Elements which provides simple key modification for macOS Sierra at first.  (Karabiner-Elements works well on macOS Sierra. We are working on fixing several remaining issues.)      We'll start updating for the full featured Karabiner for Sierra after Karabiner-Elements is completed.
