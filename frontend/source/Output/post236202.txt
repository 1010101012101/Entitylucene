"The name you entered can't be used. The name is not available. Enter a different name." <body> I'm installing El Capitan on a MacBook Air that I aquired with no internal drive, so no previous OS.  I proceed through several steps fine until "Create a Computer Account".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/as198.jpg" alt="Create a Computer Account"  But it doesn't like the details I enter and shows this cryptic error box:     strongThe name you entered can't be used./strongbr   The name is not available. Enter a different name.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PeyVW.png" alt="The name you entered can&#39;t be used."  The worst part is that it now does not allow me to edit any of the text fields! I can click on them and drag and select them, but I cannot type new letters or delete existing letters, etc.  Is this a known problem? I can't find a solution to it via Google though I do find a tiny number of people asking about it. If not, what am I missing?  <comment289007> are account names limited to 8 characters still? (old Unix use here and never tried a longer one) <comment289008> I'll try a shorter name after force restarting ... <comment289009> There is a 20 character limit. <comment289015> 1st image is broken, btw. You can just inline it yourself, then manually change the link to `img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/[uuid]" width="375"` etc afterwards, to shrink it <comment289040> Thanks @Tetsujin - fixed it the way I intended to before but messed up (-: <comment289139> Oddly, after I had to shut down to get out of this dead end loop, I did have the account and names I chose when it restarted. This might just be a very rare artefact of ultra-slow running speed since my OS is on a USB 2.0 stick for now...
