How can I change scroll direction in Snow Leopard? <body> I've gotten so used to the Lion natural scrolling that using (for lack of a better term) unnatural scrolling in Snow Leopard and earlier is very annoying. Is there any way I can reverse it for OSes before Lion?  <answer47033> Yes you can, with Scroll Reverser. It's a free app that sits in your menu bar (you can hide it if you want). It works all the way back to OS X Tiger.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWCax.png" alt=""  <comment53865> Hmm. [Is there a way to have Snow Leopard match the scrolling behavior of Lion?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18538/is-there-a-way-to-have-snow-leopard-match-the-scrolling-behavior-of-lion) <comment53869> That picture might make a nice addendum to the answer on the linked question. Perhaps at the end with the mention of tiger through snow leopard and the free bit :-) <comment53870> Oh, sorry, bmike, that didnt show up in the searching I did. <comment53880> No worries - just the other answer had more options. <comment55779> How did you get the other icons to hide for the screenshot? Is that an app? <comment55781> @timothymh My guess is Photoshop. I didn't actually take the picture. ;-) <comment55787> Oh, I didn't know. (I don't think that's it, though, as you can see the stars shining through the menu bar... where'd you find it?) <comment55792> @timothymh On the Scroll Reverser site. <comment342320> @timothymh Likely Photoshop as even though there *are* stars, they're repeated very unnaturally, see the pair repeated 11 times to the right of the menu item. <comment342349> @grgarside definitely â€” not sure what 2012 me was thinking!
