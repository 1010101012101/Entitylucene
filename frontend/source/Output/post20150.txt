How can I repair OS X Lion's Keychain Access? <body> I canâ€™t open Keychain Access (the system keychain) to modify; it freezes when I try to open it. How can I fix this problem?  <answer20162> h1Keychain Access: Keychain First Aid/h1  As you can open Keychain Access, first use its first aid to verify or repair:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ztHZ.png" alt="screenshot of the &#39;Keychain First Aid&#39; menu menu option in Keychain Access"  As commented, it's also good to use Disk Utility to verify or repair empermissions/em. Also (not specific to this question) take the opportunity to verify the integrity of your startup volume.   <comment22333> Would you mind posting all the lines of Console.app (it resides in /Applications/Utilities) which have "Keychain Access" into it? Anyway I'd repair the Disk Permission to begin with (Go to /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app, click on your HD, and then click on "Repair Disk Permissions".) <comment22339> I can into Keychain Access,and there are "login" ,"PrivateEncrypedDatak" ,"system" inside.And I can't open the "system" <comment26982> Are you still having issues after graham's advice to run the usual keychain first aid steps ? <comment45190> It appears as if the Op has abandoned this topic, but I am currently struggle with what I think is the same issue. After a reboot, I get an indeterminate amount of time before the Keychain stops working. When I am able to get into it, the First Aid reports no problems. Disk Utility also reports no issues with the drive. The next time it happens, I can post some Console logs here, unless I should open a new question... <comment61291> @Kirk You should ask a new question and link to this one. That way, you can accept an answer as correct.
