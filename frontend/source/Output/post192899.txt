Is it possible to review and close open windows <body> I'm coming from Ubuntu, where you can show an overview of all windows (minimised or not), or of all windows for an application (somewhat like mission-control), then middle-click the ones you don't want to close them.  Is there similar such functionality on the mac?  My specific use case - for example I have about 20 preview windows open some hidden, some showing (but buried) and I want to trim it down by about half.  Close-all then re-opening would be a pain, about as hard as visiting every window to find and manually closing each.  <comment229735> FWIW, Expos√© (now part of [Mission Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_(OS_X))) has been a feature in OS X for many years, and the app version of it (tied to F10 for many years, may have changed since then) shows all open (minimized or not) windows in an app. You can tab through different apps from there. I don't know if there is a way to _close_ windows from that view.
