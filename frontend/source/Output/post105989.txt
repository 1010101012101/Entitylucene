Could my data have been accessed on my lost iPhone 4 with iOS 7? <body> Yesterday, someone stole my iPhone 4 (it was updated with iOS 7), but iCloud backup was not enabled. My iPhone was locked with a 4 digit passkey.  I have confidential personal data on my iPhone, and I dont want this data to be accessed. I did quick search with 'Play sound', 'Lost mode'. After almost 1 hour I decide to use the 'Erase iPhone' option.  One hour later it shows me that my iPhone was erased.  I have the below questions:  ol liIs it possible that my peronal data was accessed by the thief? even before I started the Lost mode and Erase iPhone options?/li liIs it possible that my iPhone was accessed through iTunes?/li liSince the iPhone was shown in iCloud as 'Erased', does it mean the iPhone was for sure connected to Internet? How does he enable Wi-Fi if there was a required 4 digit passkey?/li liIs there any extra protection with iOS 7?/li /ol  <answer105993> ol liIt is only possible if the thief knew (or guessed) your passcode./li liIf your data was in standard apps(Mail, safari), then there's nothing to worry about, if it was stored in apps that allow for filesharing through the 'apps'-tab on iTunes, then I don't really know how iTunes handles that./li liYes it was connected to the Internet, but it could be with 3G (was it on when it was stolen?) or a public network that automatically connects (like Apple Stores or Starbucks) without needing a password./li liDon't really know/li /ol  In any case, report this to your local police office (bring the serial number, it should be on the box) and let them handle the theft.   <answer106014> 4) Is you enable 'find my iphone' in iOs7, the user won't be able to format your phone till he is able to login your Apple-ID account.  Eg using itunes - Restore phone will fail and require to login first. Practical, the phone codeshould/code be completely unusable now
