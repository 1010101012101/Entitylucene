How to make Open / Save dialogues stay in same folder in OS X? <body> OS X's open and save dialogues have a very detailed way of remembering (or forgetting, depends on how you see it) the directory you're working in. I have the impression it is saved individually for each app and dialogue type.  A use case: we have a file codemy/akward/long/path/logos/logo.ai/code which we want to convert to a png and then upload it to a website.  ul liIllustrator: Open Dialogue: Browse to codemy/akward/long/path/logos//code./li liIllustrator: Save for web - Save Dialogue: We're somewhere else (where we last exported to), browse to codemy/akward/long/path/logos//code again, save the png. /li liChrome: Upload button, Open dialogue: Oh no, again, we're where we last uploaded from. Browse to codemy/akward/long/path/logos//code and upload the png./li /ul  I find this constant directory browsing extremely tedious.  I just want all Save, Open and possible other dialogues of all Apps to stay in the same directory. Until I change to another directory, then stay there.  Is that possible? Maybe with an extra app?  <comment225386> In a standard file picker you can drag your intended location from Finder to picker. For more advanced options, try Default Folder X - stclair software (on phone so no link, sorry) <comment225391> Super! It's http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/release.html . I've also found a workaround: make a smart folder (http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/smart-folders-and-os-x-yosemite.html) that only displays folders used in the last day or so, then add it to the sidebar. Still one click more though. I will try the app
