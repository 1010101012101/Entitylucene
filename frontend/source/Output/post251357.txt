Is it possible to use USB output and audio port output at the same time? <body> I want to use two headphones strongemsimultaneously/em/strong; one USB and another through the audio port listening to the same audio source (i.e iTunes, Spotify, or Netflix) at the same time. Is it possible?   Info about my device,   precodeMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)   2.9 GHz Intel Core i5   OSX El Capitan 10.11.6 /code/pre  <answer251360> The short answer is strongemYES/em/strong.  What you are asking is called "aggregating your device."  This is done through emMIDI Audio Setup/em found in Applications - Utilities  In the image below, MIDI Audio Devices is opened up.  I have highlighed the two emoutput/em audio devices I want to aggregate; notice both of them are outputs (0 in/ 2 out).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSNP1.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you click the "+", select "Create Aggregate Device"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zsFfE.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you create your device, just select the devices from the right you want to aggregate into one.  In my example, I have selected the Built in Audio and my USB Codec from the previous example.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bZhol.png" alt="enter image description here"  Close MIDI Audio Setup.  When you open Sound Preferences, you will see the new output device.  Select your new aggregated device to have sound output on all devices.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGiQU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment312393> Welcome to Ask Different. It would help us if you provided additional info, such as the types of Apple device your using, OS, etc. Please see [ask] for how to ask good questions that have a better chance at being answered. - From Review - <comment312397> @fbara thanks for pointing that out. I have updated the info. :) <comment312418> I think that may be the opposite of what the OP wanted [though I'm guessing]. That's for defining 'separate output per source' in effect, rather than 'multiple outputs for a given source'. I'd be tempted to just tweak this up to cover both bases, add a paragraph on Audio Midi Setup with Multi-Output &/or Aggregate devices. <comment312430> @Tetsujin yes, I meant more like watching a movie through two headphones and not exactly what Allan described. <comment312432> @Allan is it possible to make all sound output through different devices instead of just changing output for system and media sound? <comment312478> @Tetsujin...I modified the question so it was clearer and rewrote my answer accordingly.  Hope it helps. <comment312521> Nice one. Thanks for taking the time :) <comment312557> Specifically for headphones, one could use a headphone splitter to turn the single headphone jack into two headphone jacks. Googling for "headphone splitter" turns up many options - I have seen them for under $5.
