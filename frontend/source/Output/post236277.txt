How to know that an iPhone that I purchased from a third-party is not JailBroken? <body> Say, I purchased an iPhone (not from Apple or any official reseller.)  How do I know that it's not Jailbroken?  PS. My concern is the presence of key loggers or other tracking software.  <answer236296> Not being familiar with jailbroken phones I can't offer a "what to look for" hint but really all you have to do is hook it up to iTunes and reinstall the latest OS update.  <answer236306> The best way is to go into SettingsGeneralAbout and scroll down until you see emSerial Number/em. Apple has a verification website Here to determine if the iPhone you bought is authentic. All you have to do is enter your emSerial Number/em. If it comes back with      "We're sorry, but this serial number is not valid."   Then your phone is non-authentic and fake.  <answer236310> Try looking for the app named Cydia, you can use Spotlight to search for it. It is a standard app that's installed once iOS has been jailbroken and it cannot be deleted nor uninstalled.  <comment289155> Thanks. That's something. Unfortunately I don't use iTunes. It's an awful software (especially on Windows.) So I'm **not really** looking forward to installing it again. Instead I was hoping for some official Apple app that I can download to test it? <comment289169> Just restore it with iTunes when you get it, and you'll be good. <comment289172> @AndrewLarsson: That "answer" that you linked to doesn't actually have an answer. <comment289175> Yes, I know, but this question is still a duplicate of that question, and duplicates are linked/merged so that when someone *does* answer the question, they don't have to answer it in 6 different places. <comment289181> So far this entire discussion is really missing the point entirely. If you just got a 'new' phone the first thing to do is wipe it & start afresh. Until you do, nothing on it belongs to you; you can't even tell if it's activation locked. Once you've nuke & paved it, it *cannot* be jailbroken any more, even if it was in the first place. <comment289182> @Tetsujin: Sure. But as I said in one of the comments below, I can't use iTunes to wipe it. But when I wipe the phone from the settings, there's no guarantee that the wipe is thorough. (As it can be faked by the software already on the phone.) <comment289183> Then, I'm afraid there's no way round that. You won't have iTunes, you don't trust the phone. Throw it away. <comment291410> @c00000fd I posted an answer to the question this was marked a duplicate of.
