Installing Kile on macOS <body> I have been trying to use Kile in Mac OS Sierra to use it with Mactex. I have gone through several instructions over the internet but still could not do it. Most of the instructions are for older versions of mac and didn't work with this one. I am new to Mac environment as well as Kile so any guidance will be greatly helpful. Here's what I could do so far: I had installed xcode earlier using   precodexcode-select install /code/pre  I have installed fink for Sierra using the script in the link:              https://github.com/fink/scripts/blob/master/srcinstaller/Install%20Fink.tool  I have installed kile using fink with the command:  precodefink install kile-kde4-mac /code/pre  Now whenever I start Kile, it shows a message:  "No editor component found. Please check your KDE installation"  I am not able to figure out how to proceed, any help is appreciated.  <comment367883> I'd recommend finding a different Latex editor. I like using Atom, it's pretty good (have to install some simple packages, but it's easy). Aquamacs is... decent.  Kile hasn't been updated in 4 years from what I can tell. It might not even be compatible with Sierra. <comment367889> You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately. <comment368030> Thanks @MorganRodgers. For the time being I've installed Texstudio. But I will continue trying to configure kile. I think I need to put the Commands and directory paths for accessing Mactex component just the way it's done in texstudio. will update if there's any luck.
