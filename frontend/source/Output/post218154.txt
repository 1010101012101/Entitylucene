How to delete a list of files and folder generated via find in terminal? <body> I'm generating a list of files and folder that meet certain criteria with use of a command:  precodefind ~/ -iname "whatIwantToRemove" /code/pre  The command will generate some results:  precode/Users/me//.Trash/whatIwantToRemove ... /code/pre  I would like to be able to automatically delete all of those files.  hr  h1Possible solution/h1  I'm looking at a similar discussion on Unix and Linux and was wondering whether the command would work:  precodefind . -type f -regex '/ex/' -exec rm {} \; /code/pre  <answer218157> What's wrong with the code-delete/code flag?  precodefind ~/ -iname "whatIwantToRemove" -delete /code/pre  <comment263719> Nothing, just my reflex to Google things first. Actually: `sudo find your-directory/ -name 'mytrash' -delete` seems to work
