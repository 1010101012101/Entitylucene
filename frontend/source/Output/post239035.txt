How to select frame rate when recording webcam <body> In OS X 10.10.5, I'm using QuickTime X to record video from a Logitech c920 webcam.  The only video options I see are High (720p30 H.264) and Maximum (1080p24 ProRes 444).  How can I independently specify frame rate, resolution, and codec?  I know this camera supports a wide variety of frame rates and sizes, because it's shown in ffmpeg through AVfoundation.  <comment293251> What OS are you using? <comment293253> I'm using OS X 10.10.5 <comment293257> Can you update the question to say this?
