Preview can't find fonts used in eps file generated by gnuplot <body> I am trying to use TimesNewRoman.ttf as the font for *.eps files generated by Gnuplot.  I am running OS X 10.9.5 on a 2010 Macbook Pro. Here is my gnuplot script.  precodeset terminal postscript eps enhanced size 5,5 font 'TimesNewRoman.ttf,20'  set output "./test.eps" plot sin(x) /code/pre  When I open this file with Preview, I get the error:     PostScript Conversion Warning      Converting the PostScript file “test.eps” produced the following warnings:   · TimesNewRoman.ttf not found, using Courier.   TimesNewRoman.ttf is an exact copy of Times New Roman.ttf. Gnuplot has problems trying to find files with spaces in the file name. So I copied the /Library/Fonts/Times New Roman.ttf to /Library/Fonts/TimesNewRoman.ttf and  ~/Library/Fonts/TimesNewRoman.ttf.  I believe this trick worked when I was using OS X 10.6.8, but it appears not to work in Mavericks.  How can I fix this?   <answer150222> Preview's postscript conversion doesn't use Times New Roman, but you (probably) emcan/em use Times Roman. I'm not familiar with Gnuplot, so I'm not sure how to set fonts, but the name is "Times-Roman"
