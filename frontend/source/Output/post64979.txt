Uninstall non-loaded extension from Safari <body> When opening Safari I get this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vHNth.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now I want to uninstall this extension, however it doesn't show up in the Extensions preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e4RPG.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I uninstall this?  <answer64980> That doesn't look like an extension, but a SIMBL Plugin.  These can be found in the directiory code/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/code, and you should be able to remove the codeSafariOmnibar.bundle/code from there.
