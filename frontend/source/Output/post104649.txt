iWeb 3.0.4 Save to Folder Problem <body> I want to publish my website on a private server, but I can't seem to find an option to "save to folder" on my current version of iWeb.  What do I need to do to save my files to a folder so that I can upload them to a server?  <answer104655> You can select the "publishing" method on the top level of the web site you are editing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qjRk5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment123188> I want to add that once you do this, you then need to go to FILE - Publish Entire Site
