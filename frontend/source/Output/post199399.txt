Mac terminal can't be used after set up of ~/.bash_profile <body> I was installing Apache Ant earlier and once I did, I also ran:  precodetouch ~/.bash_profile nano .bash_profile /code/pre  Within that text file I wrote:  precode. .bash_profile /code/pre  saved, exited, then ran:  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Now my Terminal looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E2khP.jpg" alt=""  I can't access my command line at all, so I went into preferences and set  precode/bin/bash -x /code/pre  to run as a default upon Terminal's open, and now it looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDyqa.jpg" alt=""  and still reads  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code[Process Completed] /code/pre  afterward. Any help?  <answer199400> I fixed it using:   precode/bin/zsh /code/pre  as the default command upon open(with 'run in shell' unchecked).  Then:   precoderm ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Then change default command upon open back to:   precode/bin/bash /code/pre  <answer199401> You've got a recursive inclusion in your code.bash_profile/code.  You can always edit the file in codeTextEdit.app/code (or another graphical text editor of your liking) if you get in to deep trouble like this.  Open up codeTextEdit/code using Spotlight or via Finder and then type kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbdo/kbd to get the codeOpen File.../code dialog. Press kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd./kbd to reveal hidden files in the dialog box and then find your code~/.bash_profile/code file. Remove the:  precode. .bash_profile /code/pre  from the file and save it and you'll have a working codebash/code shell again.  <answer199407> Your code.bash_profile/code is called automatically as your terminal loads. The code./code command is the same as codesource/code, it calls the shell script and loads it into the environment of the calling shell (as opposed to a child shell).   So what you have here is the bash profile script being called recursively. You can open it another text editor and remove the offending code. .bash_profile/code. There are several technique to seeing or opening hidden files from Finder.  If the script is on a remote box, then you will need to find another shell to edit the profile script.   <answer219083> The simplest way to get to a shell without running startup commands is to use Terminal’s     strongShell  New Command…/strong   to run codebash --noprofile/code. This tells Bash not to run the login startup script. Other shells have similar options, e.g., codezsh --no_rcs/code.  This avoids changing preferences and only affects a specific terminal, which you can then use to edit startup scripts or other configuration files that are causing problems.  <comment240008> You can also edit the file directly with an editor like Sublime, if you can't initiate a shell.
