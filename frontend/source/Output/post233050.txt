Does the iPhone SE have Sapphire glass? <body> Does the iPhone SE use stronger glass on its screen than iPhone 5S? Does it have Sapphire glass similar to iPhone 6 &amp; 6S.  <answer233059> Nope, just plain old Gorilla Glass.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HeOHI.jpg" alt="" Apple would have put it here, and it wasn't announced during the keynote.  <answer244375> Yes the iPhone SE has a Sapphire Crystal lens cover http://www.apple.com/iphone-se/specs/  <comment301169> The question is about the glas, not about the lens cover. <comment304006> iPhone 6 and 6 S have glass displays. Sapphire crystal is only on some watches and most rear camera covers at this point. Could you clarify the last sentence?
