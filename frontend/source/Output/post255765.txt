Creative Cloud 2015 apps (mostly Photoshop) frequently hang with a spinning beach ball <body> I notice that in some CC 2015 apps I often get a spinning beach ball for very minor actions. This happens most frequently in Photoshop, though, often in a series of hangs when almost every action I take from toggling a layer in the Layers panel to moving content on the Artboard triggers the spinning beach ball. Sometimes for only a second or two, other times it's several seconds each time. It's extremely frustrating and cuts down productivity immensely. This happens nearly every time I use Photoshop. It happens often in Illustrator and sometimes in InDesign as well.  I'm running CC 2015 (Photoshop 16.0.1) on a 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 iMac under Yosemite 10.10.5 with 24 GB of RAM installed. Does anyone know the cause of this and, more importantly, the solution?  <comment318692> Complete guess, & there are several iMacs with 2.7 i5s, so it would help if you clarified which in your question... but try in Photoshop Preferences  Performance & disable 'Use graphics processor' [idk where that setting is in the other apps, but ought to be similar] <comment323496> It's a 27-inch, Mid 2011. In the Performance prefs, I unchecked Use Graphics Processor but I didn't notice any change in Photoshop hanging, even after quitting and re-opening Photoshop (also tried after restarting my iMac). However, I noticed my hard drive was getting full (I was just under 10% remaining space) so I thought Scratch Disk space might be the culprit. After getting above 10% remaining, it seems to have improved. More testing will be done, though. Thanks for the suggestion.
