iPhone 4s, version 5.1.1 upgrade to 8.1.2 <body> I downloaded the Iphone4,1_8.1.2_12b440_restore.ipsw on my laptop and I pressed shift plus update it started extracting and said unknown error3194 finally after finishing. I am frustrated and I really need your guys help. I wanted to know how to fix this problem and finally upgrade my phone.  I have 5gb Free space on my phone I have iTunes version 12.0.1.26  <answer179081> First, your iTunes is out of date [current is 12.1.0.50].   Second, are you certain it was the correct file? Best is to let iTunes fetch it, then even if it fails, you can check you have the correct file name.   Third - are you certain Apple are still signing 8.1.2? They usually only give it a few days after a new release before stopping the old versions. You'd be better off trying 8.2  <comment212208> First, your iTunes is out of date.
