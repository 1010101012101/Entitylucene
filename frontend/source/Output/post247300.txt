How do I enable location services for a specific website on Safari for OS X? <body> In the past I've disabled Location Services for a specific site in Safari for OS X, but would now like to enable it, for that site only. How do I do that. None of the instructions I've found describe the current user interface for Safari (e.g., there is no "Reset Safari" window in 9.1.2).  <answer287388> Go to safari preferences (press âŒ˜+,) - Click on privacy - Then choose ask every day, and revisit the specific page tomorrow.
