My iPhone keeps switching on and off charge whilst charging, how do I fix it? <body> When I charge my iPhone 4 on my laptop, it starts charging but then it keeps going on and off charging even though it's not touched. It charges fine with a plug charger or with any computers I use at college.  <answer191256> Your computer is not giving it enough power  <answer228431> I purchased a Lifeproof Fre Power case for iPhone 6s (Feb 2016).  You must use a micro USB cable to charge the case, not a Lightning cable.  I had the same problem as Aamir Ali.  Drove me nuts.  But you are right.  Use a powerful charger and the "ON/OFF" charging problem goes away.  Same cable at home didn't work with cigar lighter charger in truck/auto, even though it is a 5.4 Amp Belkin model.  Or so they state.  When powered through top-quality and high amp chargers the problem goes away.  The cable type or model does not seem to matter.  Only the power source.  Lifeproof has been "nice", but has no good technical answer for this problem.  "You must use our cable and charger."  Hmm.  <answer257265> This happened to me with iPhone 5c. The way I charged was under a stack of books (6 or so). We went to the Apple Store to see if we could get it fixed but they said that getting it fixed would cost more than the actual phone. So I ended up just getting a whole new phone. But if you don't want to do that then like I said you could charge it under a stack of book with one on the bottom   <answer283973> You probably have a buildup of lint/debris in the phone's charger (lightning) port. Use a plastic or wood toothpic to gently scrape inside the port. Do not use a paper clip, or any other metal obeject! I had the same issue with a two year old iphone 6 and retreived enough lint to knit a sweater.  It charges without interuption now.  <comment229222> How do i give it more power? <comment229271> You can't through your computer. Either use a newer computer or use the wall charger <comment229284> This is a new laptop that i purchased only a few weeks ago and the only reason i need it connecting to my laptop is because i need to update my itunes <comment229285> You should still be able to update the content on your phone through iTunes even if the phone isn't charging. Have you tried with a different USB cable? <comment229287> It starts to connect to my laptop but then goes off and on constantly, nope as i just bought this usb cable a few weeks ago aswell. <comment229288> Very strange my friend <comment229289> Oh well, ill just try with a new usb cable soon.. thanks for the help anyway mate
