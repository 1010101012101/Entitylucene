How to disable Incognito mode in Chrome? <body> For Mac OS X, how do you disable Incognito mode in Chrome? The desired result simply being that the user cannot browse in Incognito mode, even if they know the keyboard shortcut or something similar.  <answer186027> The short answer: you must edit the preferences file so that the key codeIncognitoModeAvailability/code has a value of code1/code.  h1Original Instructions/h1  In code/Library/Preferences//code add a plist entry to the file codecom.google.Chrome.plist/code such that the key is codeIncognitoModeAvailability/code and the value is code1/code.  Here is an example: assuming the file codecom.google.Chrome.plist/code doesn't exist, use a text editor to save the following code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;    &lt;key&gt;IncognitoModeAvailability&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  The full file name and path of the above should be code/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist/code.  h1Updated Instructions/h1  Since macOS Sierra, proper plist files seem to be in some binary format by default&mdash;a format that you can't edit with a normal text editor. I found that I can open them in Apple's Xcode and it has a nice GUI&mdash;very easy to edit. If you don't have access to Xcode, I think you can use the plutil terminal command like this:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 YOUR_FILE_NAME_HERE /code/pre  In xml format, you should be able to edit it in a text editor, and a web site I read says that the xml format should work fine.  Regardless, I recently was able to disable Incognito mode using Xcode on the code~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist/code file. (Furthermore, I had to delete code/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist/code because my old version was deemed "corrupted" because it wasn't in a proper file format.)  <answer193689> I've seen a bunch of very complicated directions/suggestions for how to disable Incognito in Google Chrome for Mac OS X, but I've found a much simpler method.  Simply open up Chrome, click on "Chrome" in the upper-left hand corner; click on "Preferences"; click on "Settings"; scroll to the very bottom and click on "Show Advanced Settings"; scroll to the very bottom and click on "Reset Settings." Voila! But, now your settings are at their original settings, so you'll now have to go and reset those settings that you want to change from their original state.  <answer262704> Here's an updated way for macOS Sierra.  ol liInstall a plist editing program like PrefSetter./li liUsing Finder, go to the ~/Library/Preferences/ folder. /li liCopy and paste an existing plist file, (I used com.google.Keystone.agent.plist). /li liNow open that copied file using PrefSetter, and rename it com.google.Chrome./li liDelete all existing keys, and create a new key, giving it the name: IncognitoModeAvailability./li liUnder class, choose Integer, and under value, enter 1./li liNow save this file, and copy and paste it into the /Library/Preferences folder as well. (Remember this isn't the same folder as ~/Library/Preferences folder)/li liRestart your computer, and viola, it should work!/li /ol  <comment230929> How does that disable it? It might switch it off, but you can always switch it back on. <comment242169> Agreed.  This may shut incognito mode off temporarily, but does not disable it. <comment242174> What does "disable" mean to you? Rip out the code? Change the keyboard shortcut? Recompile it to always be cognito? Something else? (Since you've already answered - it's somewhat clear what you are asking - just a reason for someone to down vote I suppose...) <comment261559> @user26270 If you are on OS X 10.11, there is a new security feature that prevents you from editing files in `/Library`. You can [turn off SIP](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/208481/6748) and then edit the file and it will work. Also, I haven't tested this, but if you put the file in `~/Library`, maybe it will work. <comment261563> `/Library/Preferences` is not protected by SIP (would be kind of pointless anyway) <comment261569> I'm on OS X 10.10.5.  I couldn't edit the plist in a text file, had to do it through XCode.  And it still didn't disable Incognito mode. <comment261593> Hmm, well it's working great on a few machines I've seen or worked on. Maybe check spelling and capitalization on `IncognitoModeAvailability` and check that you don't have multiple installs of Chrome (maybe one local and another one). <comment262157> It is working after all.  Maybe I just had to restart, which I thought I did before commenting that it wasn't working.  I've upvoted the answer and deleted my comment saying it wasn't working. <comment288662> WORKED FOR ME, i'm using Capitan 10.11.3, create the file the file using TextEdit and save to desktop. (Make sure the name is correct!)  Then using Finder I drag/drop to /Library/Preferences. But I had to first "Show Library" using right click.  It was NOT necessary to disable SIP. <comment328416> This is very helpful in concert with e.g. the StayFocusd plugin to put more armor plating on against time-wasting websites, which is otherwise trivial. <comment328417> @BaseZen If you want an amazing app a la StayFocusd, check out a new one I'm using: [http://freedom.to](https://freedom.to)
