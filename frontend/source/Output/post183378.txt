Is wireless wake on LAN possible in a network connection where airport extreme is not primary router <body> I'm currently using a combination of a DD-WRT Router and an Airport Extreme (the previous form factor that only did N).  The DD-WRT router has better signal and routing capabilities but I really like the Apple-specific features like wireless wake on LAN and the other random Bonjour stuff the Airport Extreme provides.    Is it possible to have the non-Airport be my primary router (the one plugged into the Internet) and configure the network in such a way that I still get the Apple-specific networking features like Bonjour sleep proxy.   I would think there should be a way to do this but wanted to know if anybody had tried something similar before.    strongNote:/strong  I have to use both routers because i have a 100 year old WIFI-DESTROYER house and I have one router in the front of the house and the 2nd connected via power line networking to the back of the house.
