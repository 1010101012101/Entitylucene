Make "switch dsktop" action happen on monitor with active window <body> Is it possible to make kbdctrl/kbd + kbdleft/kbd and kbdctrl/kbd + kbdright/kbd switch between desktops on the screen where the window is active rather than on the screen where the mouse cursor is located? I work primariliy with the keyboard only, but a hindrance to my workflow is that the monitor on which the "change desktop" key combination triggers an action depends on which monitor the cursor is on rather than on what monitor the currently active window is.
