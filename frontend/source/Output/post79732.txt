Facebook app on iPad crashes every time I want to go into messages <body> I have an iPad 3, updated to iOS 6.0.1. I can use my Facebook app well in every department apart from messages. In both the top display and side display, when I click on the messages option the Facebook app will crash. I have tried uninstalling the app, restarting, installing and restarting, logging off on all my other devices but nothing improves or changes.   This seems to have started after I tried to archive some messages on the iPad version, and after that also deleted the whole thread of messages I exchanged with a friend on my PC, because the app version misses that option (which is also a total fail!)   Is there anything else I can do to fix this crashing problem?  <answer80108> I believe I found a workaround on a 4S. It appears to be stable after clicking on the menu icon, then my name, to bring up my timeline. Viewing messages no longer causes the app to crash.   I tried several things after facing the same issue with the ios facebook app under iOS 5.1.1 9B206 after deleting a whole message thread from Safari on my MBP. Perhaps the cause of the crash is the status of your specific message queue or pending changes after a deletion rather than the steps I outlined.  <comment106155> Are you still experiencing crashing? Have you resolved it?
