Can't connect my iPad to the localhost of my Mac <body> I want to access the codelocalhost/code of my Mac from my iPad. From my Mac, the address is codehttp://localhost:8888/code.  h1Through IP address/h1  The Mac and the iPad are connected to the same Wifi network. The codeIP/code address of the Mac is code10.0.0.58/code  On the iPad, I try to access codelocalhost/code with the address  precodehttp://10.0.0.58:8888 /code/pre  but the website never loads (with the error "No response from the server").  h1With code.local/code address/h1  I also tried to access codelocalhost/code via the name of the Mac. It is codecolas.local/code.  On the iPad, I try to access codelocalhost/code with the address  precodehttp://colas.local:8888 /code/pre  but the website never loads (with the error "No response from the server").  h1My question/h1  What can I do to access codelocalhost/code from the iPad? Note that they are connected with a codeUSB/code cable so it might also be possible like that.  Why don't my attempts work?  <comment294408> Why port `8888`? Have you tried doing this with just `http://10.0.0.58`?  Also, what happens when you just type `localhost` in your browser on the Mac? What about `localhost:8888`? <comment294409> Check whether the built-in firewall is activated and blocking incoming requests. You can find it under System Preferences - Security & Privacy - Firewall. <comment294411> With or without 8888 does not change anything. @gunner <comment294412> Neither localhost. <comment294437> @Lizzan Nope, the firewall is off. <comment294440> Which server setup are you using? Built-in, MAMP, other? <comment294442> MAMP, yes. I suspect this comes from the Wifi network I am connected to... <comment294471> Are you sure it is http not https, i.e.: `https://10.0.0.58:8888` <comment294561> It works with `http` when I create a local network between my Mac and the iPad. But I would have liked to do it on the main Wifi network, connected to Internet.
