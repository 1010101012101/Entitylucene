Capture screenshot of one screen with Shift-Cmd-3? <body> We already known that kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd3/kbd will capture a screenshot of entire screen. But if you have 2 or more display screens, "entire" also means "all of them".  The question is: Is there anyway (or is it possible) to force kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd3/kbd capture screenshot of primary display only if I have more than 1 display screen?  Any help would be appreciated.  <answer242943> There are 4 basic screenshot commands:  ol liSHIFT+COMMAND+3 = SCREENSHOT FILE (jpg or tiff) of  OF ENTIRE screen (or all of all displays if more than 1)/li liSHIFT+CTRL+COMMAND+3 = Clipboard (copied)image of HIGHLIGHTED area of screen /li liSHIFT+COMMAND+4 = SCREENSHOT FILE (jpg or tiff) of HIGHLIGHTED area of screen/li liSHIFT+CTRL+COMMAND+4 = Clipboard (copied)image of HIGHLIGHTED area of screen/li /ol  Using 2 &amp; 4 (above) allows you to choose the area of the display (or displays) that you want.  alternatively, your display screenshots USUALLY end up being 2 separate images - you could just take the image, then delete the one you don't need...  <answer242950> h3To capture one window/h3  kbd⌘ Command /kbd+kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd4/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd and click on the window you would like to capture.
