Stop Safari sharing on iDevice <body> I've followed all the advice on other threads, none work. I have knocked the sliders in iCloud to off for Safari but I can still see what's being viewed on my iPad by double clicking my iPhone.  <answer267776> This feature is called Handoff.      When your Mac computers and iOS devices are within Bluetooth range of   each other (about 33 feet or 10 meters), they can automatically “hand   off” what you’re doing from one device to another. For example, you   can start writing an email in Mail on your iPhone, then instantly pick   up where you left off in Mail on your Mac.   Follow the steps to turn it off:  ol liOpen the Settings app on your iOS device/li liScroll down and tap ‘General’/li liNext tap ‘Handoff’/li liTurn the ‘Handoff’ toggle off/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/amQyd.png" width="250"  <comment336059> What advice?
