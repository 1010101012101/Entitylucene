How to create a record at the runtime in applescript? <body> I would like to create a variable of type record at the runtime, I found this could work:  precodeset bcd to run script ("{" &amp; "abc" &amp; ":" &amp; "def" &amp; "}") /code/pre  But it doesn't:  precodeerror "The variable def is not defined." number -2753 /code/pre  I would like to use this in the sub-routine, where codeabc/code codedef/code will be substituted with a variables.   How to create a record in applescript in the run-time if you have a key and a value?  <answer106688> Try:  precodeset def to "My Text" set bcd to run script "{" &amp; "abc:\"" &amp; def &amp; "\"}" /code/pre  <answer157655> I've been doing something similar recently and this is the most elegant solution I came up with:  precodeset scr to "on run argList     return {|" &amp; dictKey &amp; "|: (item 1 of argList)}     end run"  set newDict to (run script scr with parameters {dictVal}) /code/pre  Hope it still helps!
