Why does my iPad keep asking for my iCloud password? <body> I keep receiving an iCloud pop-up message to insert my iCloud password every time i switch on my iPad and I'm unable to do anything on it, inserting the password doesn't help. What should I do?  <answer128869> Best way to solve this issue is going to your strongSettings/strong  ul liGo to iCloud/li liLog out/li liLog back in/li /ul  Your issue should be solved now. If not, you might have installed apps via another Apple Id which is prompting you to enter its password.  <comment169118> Except that there's no way to log out of my iCloud account that I can see (iPad 2/System 7.1.2), only delete it.
