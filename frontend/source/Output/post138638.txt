1TB ssd in late 2013 rMBP 2.4 i5 <body> I bought a 13" MacBook Pro with Retina display (Late 2013, 2.4GHz i5), and it only has 128GB storage. I found a 1 TB PCIe that will fit into the rig, but I'm a little confused from what I was reading on Apple. From what I gathered, it says that the 2.6GHz i5 is configurable up to 1TB, but says nothing about the 2.4GHz. Is this just how Apple sells it - they just don't give the option for 1TB on the 2.4 - or will this much storage not actually work on this computer?  <answer138643> According to the folks at iFixit, there aren't any compatible drives out yet.
