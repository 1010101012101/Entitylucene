How can I rebind Caps lock to delete/backspace? <body> I tried using DoubleCommand, but it doesn't let you hold down caps lock, and pressing it causes caps lock light to be enabled/disabled. Ideally I want caps lock to never be enabled and for the key to behave exactly as though it were the delete key.  Another problem that DoubleCommand has is that every second press just toggles the light, and doesn't delete a character.  <answer7234> You may want to try Seil (formerly PCKeyboardHack). I use it to bind Caps Lock to Right-Ctrl (not plain Ctrl), so that I can bind Caps Lock to Meta in Emacs (while Ctrl remains Ctrl, and other keys are kept to the usual behavior).  <answer251648> ControllerMate gets normal auto-repeat, no delay nor light toggle given Apple ➤ System Preferences… ➤ Keyboard ➤ Keyboard ➤ Modifier Keys… ➤ Caps Lock Key ➤ No Action.BR/ Control, Meta (Alt) and Control-Meta took extra logic: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t82J5.png" alt="ControllerMate&#39;s wacky visual programming language" PRE       Peace             —Devon/PRE  P.S. Emacs² &amp; Lisp³ grew up with Rubout left of letter A — see the Knight TV keyboard⁴ and Space Cadet keyboard⁵ layouts with Control-Meta-Super-Hyper-Shift-Greek-Top modifier keys.  P.P.S. Password input may require the hardware delete key.  P.P.P.S. If you manage to get caps lock functionality on a both-shifts key chord do let me know.  P.P.P.P.S.

To make sure that there is no delay though, you'll want to install and use KeyRemap4MacBook as well (same website). The instructions are located here: http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/extra.html#t1 <comment7773> on my newer macbook, all I needed to do was use Keyboard preferences to disable caps lock, and then install PCKeyboardHack to map caps lock (I mapped it to Esc for use in vim) <comment7816> Indeed I do not have any delay when you remapping (or disabling I guess) Caps Lock in the System Preferences  Keyboard Preference Pane  Modifier Keys… popup. <comment166794> The application has been renamed "Seil": https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en
