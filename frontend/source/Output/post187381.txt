Can I extract the body of an email message using Automator without an AppleScript? <body> I want to build a system where all emails that are sent to a specific folder are added to a Devon Think Pro Office database for archiving/searching.   There is an add-in from the DTP folks that will allow me to add a given email to the DTP inbox on a case-by-case basis, but that is not modifiable.  I have not used AppleScript before, and do not want to learn it to do this one thing at the moment. (time constraints)  Thanks for looking  <answer187389> You do not need a script or Automator for that.  Click on the email of interest and use the shift+cmd+s  That will bring up a window where you can now save that email as plain text in a location of your choice.  You could set up a Rules in Mac mail to get it better organized in a single folder for example.  If you want the system to find (filter) the emails and save as plain text and do that automatically for you then you need Automator and a script.  <comment221477> The simple answer is No. Unless you find a third party Automator Action. <comment221697> Thanks fir the reply, markhunte. It's what I thought through my searching, but I hoped that I might be wrong. I have not found a third party Automator Action that will do this automagically. <comment221699> Thanks, Buscar. The thing is that I want to automate this, as you point out in the last sentence. <comment221756> ok, no problem lets use Automator+Script for that than---this comment will self destruct in 1 day. <comment242193> I need a bumper sticker that says SHIT-COMMAND-S :-)
