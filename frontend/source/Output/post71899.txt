Setting up a Gopher server on OS X (for real!) <body> I have been trying to host my own Gopher server under OS X (specifically, Snow Leopard), but am finding the process somewhat frustrating.  After trying (and failing) to install myriad supposedly cross-platform server packages, I settled on emAftershock/em, as it is the only one which seems to 'work' &ndash; and I use that word very loosely.  Ideally, I would like to host the server without the need for any specialised software, but in order to do so I need to know the name of the 'root document' a Gopher client looks for when connecting (e.g. Web browsers expect a file called codeindex/code). Unfortunately, RFC 1436 (the document which specifies the standards of the Gopher protocol) only mentions what this mystery file must contain, but not its name.  I have tried using code!Gopher Links/code, code.Link/code and code.Links/code as file names, but all result in an "Unable to access document" error when viewed using the command-line browser emlynx/em.  If anyone can shed any light, I will be most obliged!  <comment83486> in HTTP, the server determines the name of the default document.  Different servers can be configured to server up different default documents.  It's not client specific.  I suspect Gopher is the same.  According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol) if you request an empty selector, the default directory should be returned. <comment83489> You may have more luck asking over at [serverfault](http://serverfault.com/). <comment83595> Thanks, laaph. I've done just that :-) <comment83645> Sadly, they weren't particularly helpful at _serverfault_, so I've resorted to contacting _Aftershock_'s creator. Hopefully he'll be able to assist.
