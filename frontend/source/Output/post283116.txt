Does an Apple warranty cover accidental damage? <body> I bought an Apple MacBook Air and got a small dent on one corner.br Is it covered by Apple's one year warranty.  <answer283117> Warranties cover manufacturing defects or breakdowns, not damage.  For that you need insurance.  <answer283143> Per the Terms and Conditions of AppleCare support plans specific to the Mac, AppleTV, and the Apple Display, Section 4 subsection  (ii):     h34.  What is not Covered?/h3      4.1 Hardware Service. The Plan does not apply to:      ...      (ii) Damage caused by (a) a product that is not the Covered Equipment   (b) strongaccident, abuse, misuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other   external cause,/strong (c) operating the Covered Equipment outside the   permitted or intended uses described by the manufacturer, or (d)   service (including upgrades and expansions) performed by anyone who is   not a representative of Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider   (“AASP”);   (emphasis mine)  You need 3rd party insurance.  I have used Safeware in the past, but there are other options like SquareTrade  <comment356925> @bret7600 et al.  This is very much *on topic* as the question is narrow enough in scope to get an accurate, non opinionated answer.
