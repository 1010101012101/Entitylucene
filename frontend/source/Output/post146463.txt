ATI Radeon X1900XT Mac Pro 1.1 Compatibility <body> I've recently picked up a ATI Radeon X1900XT card that I was told would work with my Mac Pro (original 1.1 version).  However when I plugged the card into my pci port and turned the system on, the card's fan started running, but there was no output to my monitors.  After a little more research it looks like there are two different models of the X1900XT, and I could use some help determining which one I have.  The one I have looks like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814195002  But there is another one like this: http://www.cnet.com/products/ati-radeon-x1900/  Since they seem to have the same model number, is there one that is Apple specific and one that isn't?  <comment172575> So where does it says it is Mac compatible ? <comment172582> http://support.apple.com/kb/DL199 <comment172584> Using your links it shows 1900XT and 1900XTX ! and I assume your Firmware is up to date.
