Convert animated gif to mp4 <body> I'm looking for a tool (GUI would be best) to convert an animated gif to a mp4-video to send it via WhatsApp. Do you have any suggestions that get this job done?  <answer103834> You can use two programs, Imagemagick's codeconvert/code command and codeffmpeg/code, to do this.   precodeconvert -coalesce animation.gif frames%04d.png /code/pre  Then convert the pngs to a movie:  precodeffmpeg -r 10 -i frames%04d.png -vcodec mjpeg -y movie.mp4 /code/pre  For a GUI, it would not gain you much convenience, but I know QuickTime Pro (you might have to get the old version) will convert a stack of sequential images into an animation. I don't know if it will read the GIF properly.   Edit: see @Henry's answer for another codec using h264.   <answer116425> Despite using Mavericks, I still keep Quicktime 7 Pro Player on my disk.  It is just fine for viewing animated GIFs and exporting them in other formats.  strongadded/strong    Requires Quicktime 7 (optional install, or keep it in your Applications when you install new versions of the OS).  Requires the paid "Pro" upgrade key, Quicktime 7 version available since 2005 or so.  Open the GIF file with Quicktime Player 7.  (Drag the GIF icon onto the Player icon; or right-click the GIF icon and choose Quicktime Player 7 under "Open with"; or start Quicktime Player 7, then use codeOpen File.../code in thecodeFile/code menu)  Play it to make sure it is working.  You can use the left and right arrow keys to go forward or back one frame at a time.  codeWindow/code  codeShow Movie Inspector/code (or kbd⌘-I/kbd).  Write down the "Normal size", 270 x 600 or whatever it is  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ArsSJ.jpg" alt="inspector"  codeFile/code  codeExport/code (or kbd⌘-E/kbd)  In the codeExport:/code menu choose codeMovie to MPEG-4/code (or some other format if you wish)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UVnsF.jpg" alt="export"  Use the Options button to control some characteristics of the MP4 file.  In particular, set the Image size (if the size you wrote down isn't in the menu, choose codeCustom/code and write it in).  Try format codeMPEG-4 Improved/code.  Click codeOK/code when you are finished with options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5vZw7.jpg" alt="options"  Select the destination and filename for the MP4 file  Click codeSave/code  <answer215954> Beroe's answer was really helpful but I found that when I created mp4s using his method it didn't work on QT or iMovie on El Capitan. I did a little digging and read the encoding logs and stumbled upon this solution, seems to work with QT and iMovie:              codeffmpeg -r 10 -i frames%04d.jpg -vcodec h264 -y -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mp4/code  <comment136180> Hi, could I ask you to summarise the steps required to achieve this, as I think it's useful info that still may need further explaining for some users. <comment261070> I think you need `frames*.jpg` or `frames*.png` rather than `frames%04d.jpg` <comment289933> if one of these answered you, can you click the check to close your question.
