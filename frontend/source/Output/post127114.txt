Is it possible to hide files from Terminal's ls? <body> I am saving some files because I need to reinstall OS X, and noticed oddly high numbers of files in some folders. Is it possible for malware to hide files from codels/code?  <answer127115> Hidden files are hidden from ls unless you use the code-a/code or code-A/code flag:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code-A   List all entries except for . and ...  Always set for the super-user. -a   Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.). /code/pre  supSource: ls man page/sup  strongTherefore, files can be hidden by starting the filename with a code./code/strong but ls will still show the file if it is run with code-a/code or code-A/code.  Note that not all files that are hidden with a . are malware-related. The system creates many files like this for a variety of reasons in various places on the disk that can cause problems if removed or modified.  <answer127126> ls is not a command that opens the directory file itself and show it's contents. It uses dirent (Directory Entries) from the C library which is used by a lot of software like stat but also bash's parameter expansion.  So the real question is then: Is it possible for malware to hide files from BSD/Darwin? strongNo, you can't hide files from it's own system/strong because it will turn into waste (read:free to overwrite) very soon.   <comment148942> one additional note: there are many legitimate files the OS hides in this manner. Finding files using `ls -a` does not indicate the presence of malware. <comment148979> @dwightk I know, but maybe other people reading this don't. (grgarside: maybe include it in the answer, as some people - including me - do not always read all the comments.) <comment148980> Thank you, this was very helpful as well. (Hence +1.) <comment148982> What is this command "Ls"? :) <comment149021> It list all the directories and files in the current directory. (Including hidden files if you add the `-a` flag.)
