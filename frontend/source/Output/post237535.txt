Reset Enhanced Dictation to its untrained state? <body> I believe Enhanced Dictation includes functionality to train itself on words found on the user's operating system (for instance, proper nouns found in the Contacts database) and also to improve its speech recognition processes.  In order to restore Enhanced Dictation to its untrained state, is it enough to delete the code/System/Library/Speech/Recognizers/code directory and its contents and then reinstall it from the System Preferences UI? Or is there training data cached somewhere else in the system that would also have to be removed?  I am currently in OS 10.9.5.
