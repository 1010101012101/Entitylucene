Finder resets preferences on restart <body> Im on macOS Sierra 10.12.5. I have customized a few things (finder window's toolbar, how to keep directories ordered by name etc) but sometimes (I think on restart, not sure) all this goes back to factory settings and I have to do it all over again. It is really annoying.  It seems people had this problem on older versions too but I prefer to ask again since it was like 4 years ago.   What can I do to prevent this? Thanks  <answer285624> It’s possible your Finder preference file is corrupted.  Open strongFinder/strong, then press kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbdG/kbd. In the popup textbox, type in code~/Library/Preferences/code.  Locate codecom.apple.finder.plist/code and delete it. Restart your system and see if the issue persists. If it does, you can pull the file back out of the Trash and restart one more time.  <comment360342> Can you please provide details of your startup disk (i.e. capacity, free space)? <comment360732> I don't know why the file was corrupted in the first place but this worked. Thanks! <comment360733> @Monomeeth I had plenty of free space (100Go at least)
