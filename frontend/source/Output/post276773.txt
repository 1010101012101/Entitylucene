Where does Calendar pull emails for autocomplete? <body> I have several Gmail accounts set up on my Calendar app in OS X. Recently, though, most of the email autocomplete is not working when I'm creating a new event unless it's a contact from my personal Gmail account. I have several with different companies that all use Gmail. I have the Contacts checked for all of the associated accounts. I've attached a screenshot for reference.   Any ideas how to fix this? I've looked at both my Gmail contact lists and OS X's contact, and the calendar app does not seem to pull email address from any of it because I've cross-checked which ones autocomplete and which ones don't  I don't recall installing anything new on OS X recently.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PTGay.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment348418> Welcome to Ask Different. Could you please edit your question to add info such as: (1) What you've tried already? (2) How long has this problem been happening? (3) Did this issue coincide with anything else (e.g. other issues, an OS update, software installation, etc).? <comment348421> Updated my post. What I really would like to know is where calendar is puling the emails from. It doesn't seem to pull from neither the Gmail contact or the OS X contact list. <comment348422> Did this work properly at some point? <comment348423> @Harv I recall setting up events and not needing to copy and paste emails into it.
