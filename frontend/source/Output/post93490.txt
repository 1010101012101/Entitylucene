You can then select an app that you wish to remove iCloud data for, tap Edit, then delete the data that you no longer need on iCloud.br (Some apps only have a Documents &amp; Data section - this means that it will remove emall/em data from iCloud, without any option of selecting individual files.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKRUr.png" alt="iCloud on iOS"  h2On Mac/h2  You can go to strong~/Library/Mobile Documents/strong and delete individual apps/files there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7S22h.png" alt="iCloud on Mac"
