Can i map other folder to Launchpad <body> I am using OSX 10.8.  Is it possible to map an extra Application folder to launchpad so that launchpad will pick .app from that folder too ?   I have osx install disk names OSX and i install apps in 'Applications' folder. Now i have added one more disk named "Macintosh" i have installed some programmes in that disk too. I want to get the apps in MacintoshApplications in Launchpad.   There should be a way right ?   Does that makes sense ?  <answer88846> You can try to "symlink" the files on your other partition to your Applications-Folder.  strongFor example:/strong  precodeln -s /Volumes/Macintosh2/Applications2/App.app /Applications/ /code/pre  Launchpad follow the symlink and show the Apps.   <comment103663> Could you give an example of what you're asking ? <comment103667> @MatthieuRiegler okay. i have osx install disk names `OSX` and i install apps in 'Applications' folder. Now i have added one more disk named "Macintosh" i have installed some programmes in that disk too. I want to get the apps in MacintoshApplications in Launchpad. Does that makes sense ? <comment103692> I think that won't be so easy. Launchpad does not only require the apps to be in `Applications`, but it also looks for the libraries under `Library` <comment104363> Okay i will try this and let you know the result? do i need to symlink all apps ? <comment104389> You can try to symlink your App-Folder on the other hard drive/partition
