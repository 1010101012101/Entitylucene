Why is my codesigned app still quarantined by macOS? <body> I have a .app that is quarantined. But I am super confused - how can my .app be properly codesigned and yet still be quarantined by Apple? I have an app called iTest.app that I downloaded from my server and made sure that it was codesigned correctly but yet it is still quarantined? I thought that having a valid code signature was the whole point of getting past Gatekeeper?  precodeMyMac-7:Downloads user$ ls -l@ iTest.app total 0 drwxr-xr-x@ 7 user staff  238 Apr 21 08:05 Contents com.apple.quarantine     67   MyiMac-7:Downloads user$ codesign --verify --deep --strict -vvvvvvv  iTest.app iTest.app: valid on disk iTest.app: satisfies its Designated Requirement  MyiMac-7:Downloads user$ spctl -a -t exec -vvvvvvv iTest.app iTest.app: accepted source=Developer ID origin=Developer ID Application: myID /code/pre  <answer281544> The codecom.apple.quarantine/code is an OS X feature, this happens every time you download from the internet :  https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/Carbon/RN-LaunchServices/index.html  <comment354248> is there any work around for this?  It keeps placing my download in some random /private/var path which screws up my Applescript code.
