How can I use "Capslock" in iOS? <body> On rare occasion I'll want to type a whole word in capital letters, but I can't get the iOS keyboard to "stick" it's shift down. In Android I can hold the Shift key and it'll stay in Shift until I hold it again.  How can I capslock/hold shift in iOS' keyboard? I'm on iOS 5.1  <answer49377> Double tap on shift to enable caps lock.  The shift button will turn fully blue to indicate caps lock is enabled:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KN8C9.png" alt="Caps lock enabled"  A glow on the shift arrow after a single tap denotes a normal shift press that is removed after the next keystroke:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cg9yK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment56567> Also make sure that "Enable Caps Lock" is set to On under Settings - General - Keyboard if it doesn't work.
