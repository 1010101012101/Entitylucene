How do I do a pivot table in Numbers? <body> I can't find any equivalent of the Excel Pivot Table or Open Office Data Table features. I'd like to sum up my data grouped by values in various columns.  For example, if I have  precodeA       B       C red     left    2 red     left    3 green   left    4 green   right   4 /code/pre  I want to be able to get  precode        red     green   all left    5       4       9 right   0       4       4 all     5       8       13 /code/pre  <answer97674> Assuming the tables are named strongOriginal/strong and strongPivot/strong, the cells in Pivot are filled using this formula:  precode=SUMIFS(Original::$C, Original::$A, "="&amp; $A2, Original::$B, "="&amp; B$1) /code/pre  i.e. sum values in codeOriginal::$C/code if  ul licorresponding value in codeOriginal::$A/code = value in first column of Pivot/li licorresponding value in codeOriginal::$B/code = value in first row of Pivot/li /ul  The 'strongall/strong' values are just simple sums of those rows or columns.  <answer270049> Pivot table simply do not exist in Numbers and as far as I know they have never existed. In previous versions however there was a feature called "Categories" which used to serve almost the same purpose, but unfortunately in the more recent versions many of the features has been removed and "Categories" is one of them. The only possible way I have found to emulate a pivot table was to use formulas to categorize different values and run an aggregate on the them. This technique is explained here in the following blog post: How to mimic pivot tables in Numbers 3   <comment59695> Apparently there is a categories feature that gives some of this power, but I'm still looking for a better answer. http://macmost.com/pivot-tables-in-iwork-09-numbers.html <comment103951> What led you to think pivot tables are implemented in Numbers. It's not there AFAIK. <comment339311> Welcome to Ask Different!  We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.
