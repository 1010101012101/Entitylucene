iTunes could not back up the iPhone because the backup could not be saved on the computer. Please Disconnect and reconnect Iphone and try again <body> Hi I'm Running Yosemite on Macbook 5,1 Late 2008 2.0GHz with SSD for apps and HDD for data.  I'm Trying to back-up my iPhone on the computer but i'm not able. I tried restarting both computer and phone. It doesn't let me click on back up now either.   Any suggestion?  <comment190075> Has it worked previously on the same machine & phone?
