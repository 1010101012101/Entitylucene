What is the best app for controlling the time of kids spend on iPad? <body> My kids spend way more time on ipad. I want to limit the time each child spends on iPad on a daily basis. Any apps? They yell at us for taking away the iPad.  <answer206729> Here are a few:  ParentKit br Parental Timelock br TimeLock (I couldn't post link)  You can also restrict and block internet usage during certain days and time blocks for each device in your home that uses your wifi. You can do this through your wifi router.   <comment206394> Have you used Guided Access? In iOS 8 you can set a time limit.
