Changing Finder's Font Size - Lion <body> I open My Documents in finder.  Click CMD-J and change the font size to 10.  I choose set as default.  The font size looks right on My Documents.  Then I navigate to Applications, and the font size is 12.  Is there a way I can change my font size on all folders?  Thanks!  <answer81974>    You have to delete the code.DS_Store/code files in each folder.   How to do that? Via Onyx. You can also unhide all invisible files (code.DS_Store/code files are invisible) and delete them one by one.   After that, you can "set default" in the root folder and it should be in all the folders below      / - /Applications br /         / - /Documents etc.   <comment94519> Or, more conveniently from a terminal. Go to the parent of where you'd like all the .DS_Store files removed and use `find . -iname ".DS_Store" | xargs rm` <comment94535> @CraftyThumber If `rm` was aliased to `rm -r`, there was a path like `~/Some Documents and Stuff/.DS_Store`, and PWD was `~/`, that would delete `~/Documents/`. `find . -name .DS_Store -delete` is much better. <comment94565> @LauriRanta, I don't think it would. It would expand to `rm -r /path/to/first/.DS_Store; rm -r /path/to/next/.DS_Store; ...`. It would only be a problem if someone had a directory called .DS_Store (unlikely). <comment94658> @CraftyThumber Try running `find . -iname ".DS_Store" | xargs printf '%s\n'`. <comment94674> OK, make it `find . -name ".DS_Store" | xargs -0 rm`... You make a good point for a corner case where someone aliases `rm` (which I would never recommend) and they use spaces in their directory names (which I guess isn't that uncommon); +1 to you :) <comment94766> Thank you guys!  I ended up using: find . -name ".DS_Store" | xargs -0 rm
