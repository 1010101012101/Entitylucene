One message that cannot be deleted on iPhone 4 <body> I have a single message in Mail on my iPhone 4 that just cannot be deleted. I get a popup saying strongUnable to move message - The message could not be moved to the trash folder/strong.  I'm using the latest version of iOS. The account is an Exchange Active Sync account and deleting other messages is not a problem. I also use the same Exchange account from Outlook on my desktop and the message in question does not exist in Outlook. It only shows in Mail on iPhone.  I also have an another IMAP account on my iPhone and deleting isn't a problem on that account.  How can I remove this rogue message?  <answer6013> You could try removing the Exchange account completely and setting it up again. Maybe this also deletes the message.  <answer6014> It sounds like Mail got a bit out of sync and it can't move the message because it doesn't exist. Here are a few things you can do to get it to resync.  ol li'Quit' the Mail app - from the home screen, double 'click' the home button to show the list of recent apps. Press and hold the Mail app icon until it shakes and displays a red icon. Tap the red icon./li liRestart your phone - always a good thing to try with software and caching problems./li liRe-configure your mail account - this is a bit of a pain, but you should won't lose any messages because they are all on the server./li /ol  <answer9647> I found that after a month the undeletable email would disappear from the mail app. This I can live with because I don't like the other option of setting up the Exchange account all over again.  <answer111669> I had the same problem occur recently with iPhone 5. After several days of trying everything under the sun I deleted the account and set it up from scratch. Not really a solution cause I'll be upset if I have to do this frequently.   <answer127626> I found a quick way that worked.  ul liGo to the mail setting /li liUnselect mail (checkbox) leave the others as they were. /li /ul  This takes a minute or so and the corrupt e-mail go. Then reselect mail and the correct ones appear.  <answer265856> Try this link.  there are several options to try. http://appletoolbox.com/2014/03/ios-unable-to-move-message-fix/  <comment10081> Thanks.

The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
