What determines whether multiple highlighted files in Finder show in the same Get Info window? <body> I'll often highlight a bunch of files in Finder to find their collective size with Cmd+I. Sometimes the Get Info window shows the pooled size in a single window, but other times it'll open 40 separate Get Info windows. What determines when this happens?  (I've since learned that other key combinations will always show the highlighted items' collective size, but when does Cmd+I alone act one way instead of the aforementioned other?)  <answer96486> You are most probably inadvertently pressing kbdOption/kbd along with kbd⌘/kbd, don't you think?   There's no magic here, if you press kbd⌘/kbdkbdI/kbd you get a 'Get Info' window for every selected Finder item. If you press kbdOption/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdI/kbd you get a combined 'Show Inspector' window.  That or you keyboard is broken.  <comment113359> Nope—definitely not. (I also usually do this with one hand, so I'd notice.) This has also happened for years, through many variations of OS X. The only other factor I can consider is whether it happens on the Desktop or in a Finder folder. <comment113380> I understand this is not the answer you wanted to hear. You need to troubleshoot the issue, I can only think of installing something like a keylogger and check which keys were pressed when this happens again, otherwise you are just groping in the dark... <comment113422> I asked also to determine whether it happens to others too. Thanks for the answer
