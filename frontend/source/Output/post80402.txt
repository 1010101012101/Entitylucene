Finder opens new window each time <body> I just created a DMG and threw some folders in it. If I double-click a folder it opens in a new Finder window each time. Folders outside of the DMG are still opening normally. Holding codeoption/code when I double-click causes the former window to close, but it's pretty inconvenient. Does anyone know how to get a DMG to show up in a normal Finder shell?  This is what I'm seeing, for what it's worth:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ef5ND.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer80409> There are many things that could be going wrong here. First of all, make sure that when you navigate to Finder  Preferences  General, the option "Always open folders in a new window" is unchecked. If not, there are many solutions to your problem listed below:  ul liNaviate to View  Show Toolbar/li liNavigate to View  as List, as Columns, or as Cover Flow/li liGet TotalFinder (http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/), which adds many more settings to Finder/li /ul  Good luck!  <comment92792> I hope someone has a hidden preference to enable this since the Finder and [DiskImageMounter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiskImageMounter) clearly want to make a new window when it first mounts a dmg. I poked a bit at `hdiutil imageinfo file.dmg` on several images to see if there were a field that could be set to suppress this, but nothing looks promising. <comment92801> Thanks Zoyt! It was Show Toolbar that did the trick.
