How can I use Dropbox for iPhone and iPad backup and not iCloud? <body> Both devices drove me nuts until I caved and increased my iCloud storage for backup.  I couldn't find a way to change default to my Dropbox account.  Please tell me how....  <answer156776> There is no way to use Dropbox as a backup target for a backup of your entire device (or to restore from it, for that matter). You can either use iCloud or your computer.  <answer156790> Tubedogg is right; there is no way to directly back up to your dropbox.  However, if you have your heart set on emstoring/em your backups in dropbox, you could back up to your computer and use a sym link to route iTunes' backups to a dropbox folder
