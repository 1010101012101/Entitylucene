Extract passwords from local items keychain files <body> I know that one can easily migrate any *.keychain from one Mac to another, however, the "local items" keychain introduced in Mavericks is not stored as a *.keychain file but as a list of *.kb and *.db files.  I don't use iCloud Keychain and don't plan on using it. I also don't have access to the same device that was used to create the local items in the first place. The logic board has been changed.  As using a backup from time machine only partially restored the local items keychain (a number of entries are definitely missing) I am wondering whether I can in any way or shape extract the previously created items in the local items list and/or import them into a new "real" keychain.  <answer162300> h1Backup of emLocal Items/em keychain/h1  ol liCreate a new keychain in emKeychain Access/em via emFile  New Keychain.../em/li liCopy all the entries from emLocal Items/em over to this newly created keychain/li liBackup the keychain by navigating to em~/Library/Keychains//em and copying the newly created keychain to a safe place/li liYou can now delete the newly created keychain in emKeychain Access/em via right-click emDelete Keychain/em (emDelete References &amp; Files/em)/li /ol  h1Restore of emLocal Items/em keychain/h1  ol liAdd the backed up keychain in emKeychain Access/em via emFile  Add Keychain.../em and navigating to its location/li liCopy all the entries from this keychain over to emLocal Items/em/li liYou can delete the previously added keychain since all of the entries now reside in emLocal Items/em/li /ol  <comment168413> I have [a similar issue](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/142962/how-do-i-migrate-my-keychains-local-items-to-a-new-mac). Have you had any luck with this? <comment168415> Sorry, no solution yet and I personally don't have the time to work on it for the foreseeable future … using forgot my password functions mostly worked and I had all important passwords covered in the login.keychain anyway. <comment168416> Bummer. This has really messed me up (lots of critical passwords in "Local Items" — I never asked to put them there! — and now I'm stuck). <comment190018> This generally works, however, only for the keychain elements used prior to Mavericks. Mavericks and Yosemite use the iCloud/Local Items keychain by default instead. Importing these is appears to be impossible. Which is why your solution doesn't work for my particular question. <comment274186> For typing my password 200 times, I used the AppleScript here: https://gist.github.com/rmondello/b933231b1fcc83a7db0b
