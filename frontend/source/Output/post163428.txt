how to Quick Look text files with custom file extensions in Finder <body> When I have .txt files or .py files, I can Quick Look those files in Finder. I have .jl files that are codes written in the Julia Language. Of course they are text files. They will open in a text editor like Sublime Text. How can I Quick Look these .jl files in Finder?  <answer163463> Install QLStephen, a QuickLook plugin that enables viewing of text files with arbitrary filetypes.  <comment191355> how do you preview in Finder? do you mean the Quick Look ? <comment191371> I think if one works the other will. <comment191376> Have a look at this thread http://superuser.com/questions/230204/make-os-xs-quick-look-work-for-custom-file-extensions <comment191450> @Buscarì›ƒ Yes, I meant Quick Look. I will modify the question. <comment232447> Looks like a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23561/is-there-a-quicklook-preview-for-plain-text-files-with-unknown-extensions
