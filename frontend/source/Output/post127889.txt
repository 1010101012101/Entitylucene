How to add a new column to OmniOutliner and make it a true first column? <body> On the Mac, still using OmniOutliner 3 (3.10.6, to be specific).  My goal is to add a new, first column to an OmniOutliner document, which I have tried to do in two different ways:  ol liAdd a column after the first and move it into the first position./li liAdd a column after the "notes" column (basically the gutter of the doc)./li /ol  The problem is that the row handles stay with the original column, which means that they effectively are shown in the second column, and the same applies to the notes - they only appear under the second column.  What is the way (if any) to tell the document that the new column is the first and should look and feel accordingly?
