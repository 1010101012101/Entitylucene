Custom shortcut executes service twice <body> Following this answer I have created a custom service that executes a shell script that looks like this:  precodeopen -a FireFox "http://dict.cc/$1" /code/pre  It works fine when I click. Then I defined a custom shortcut for it, (kbd&#8679;/kbd kbd&#8984;/kbd kbdL/kbd), and when I use that, the script seems to get executed twice (two tabs open, both showing the desired page). How can I fix that?  strongEdit/strong: This only seems to happen when I invoce the service using the shortcut from within FireFox.  strongEdit 2/strong: This gets weirder and weirder. I now created a second script for looking up stuff in Google, and bound it to the hotkey kbd&#8679;/kbd kbd&#8984;/kbd kbdT/kbd. Now when I press that, it actually opens emboth/em my custom services. I have no idea why this happens.  Also, I removed both the hotkeys temporarily to check if they were used, but nothing happened when I pressed them.  <answer7091> Strangeâ€¦ maybe trying to rebuild your services menu (and then restarting) will help? See the top answer here:  https://superuser.com/questions/43700/snow-leopard-services-menu-says-its-building  <answer7155> Rather than a direct answer to your question, why don't you try something like Alfred which allows you to setup custom web queries which are a keyboard shortcut away.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEi0u.jpg" alt="Custom Search Pane"  <comment7533> I wonder if somehow an extension or something in firefox already is using the cmd-shift-L shortcut? <comment7555> I checked, and it does not seem to be the case.
