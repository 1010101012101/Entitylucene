How can I remove a pre-installed application on macOS Sierra <body> I need to remove one of the pre-installed applications (Safari in my case) from a macOS Sierra system. Yet simply deleting the app, installing 3rd party "cleaning" software or any attempts to delete it via the terminal remain unsuccessful. I found out that since Mac OS 10.11 apple features so called 'System Integrity Protection', that basically forbidds its users to modify or uninstall 'system relevant applications'.  So how can I remove a pre-installed application on such a system?  PS: I already know that this may be a bad idea in regard of future upgrades. Nevertheless let's just assume I'm willing to take the risk and am just looking for ways to get this done.  <answer282499> If you must disable SIP within macOS Sierra, here are the steps involved:  ol liStartup (or restart) your Mac/li liImmediately hold down the kbdcommand/kbdkbdR/kbd keys to boot into recovery/li liClick the Utilities menu and select Terminal/li liType codecsrutil disable/code and press kbdreturn/kbd/li liClose the Terminal app/li liSelect Restart.... from the ï£¿ menu/li /ol  strongNOTE/strong  ul liI really do not recommend you keep SIP disabled. To switch on (or re-activate) SIP, repeat the above steps, except that at Step 4 use codecsrutil enable/code stronginstead of/strong codecsrutil disable/code./li /ul  <answer282501> You strongtechnically/strong can remove Safari by weakening your system's security protections and disabling SIP.  Again: strongDo not do it!/strong  Steps:  ol liReboot on the recovery partition (hold cmd-R while rebooting until the Apple logo appears)/li liOpen the Terminal from the Utilities menu/li liType codecsrutil disable/code/li liReboot/li liYou should now able to remove Safari (if the Finder does not let you do it, use the Terminal and type codesudo rm -fr /Applications/Safari.app/code)/li liI'd highly recommend you reactivate SIP then by rebooting and typing codecsrutil enable/code (it won't reinstall Safari)/li /ol  <comment355868> Thank you for your reply. Disableing SIP works as you describe, yet I'm still not able to remove Safari :( <comment355874> I really think, if you need a specific solution to a specific problem... then you're going to have to tell us what it is. Otherwise we can do no more than offer suggestions, each of which is then rejected for another non-specific reason. As already pointed out, removing Safari doesn't remove networking capability. Also, if the user is also admin [which is why I presume you rejected Parental Controls] they can just undo anything you do. <comment355887> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/58038/discussion-between-frizlab-and-hendrik). <comment355888> Removing/disabling Safari will not prevent a user from downloading Chrome or Firefox using `curl` or a short `python` script, or using `w3` mode in Emacs, or using an USB stick with Safari.app on it, or some other means of accessing the web. Not even switching to Linux will prevent this from happening. <comment355890> I've rewritten your question to focus more on the problem of removing pre-installed applications on Sierra. <comment355915> Answer edited to match the changes I've made to the question. <comment355916> Answer edited to match the changes I've made to the question. <comment355971> Booting from a spare startup drive is often helpful in situations like this.
