Edit default alert in subscribed calender <body> I am currently subscribed to myasics ics running calender which shows my training plan. Its default alert is set to one week before.  I want to change that to two alerts. One being the day before and one on the day. I cant seem to edit this default.  How do I alter it?  <answer270249> strongOn a Mac/strong running a current OS, this is how you would go about adding multiple alerts for one event.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nu9dg.gif" alt="enter image description here"  ul liDouble-click your event/li liClick the date/time of the event/li liClick the 'Alert' field and select when you would like your first alert to happen (notice that there is a 'custom' field)/li liNow that you've selected a time period for your first alert, if you hover over the 'Alert' field you should see a small '+' symbol to the right; if you click it, it should trigger a second alert option./li /ul  strongOn an iPhone:/strong  ul liLocate your event and tap it to open it/li liClick 'Edit' in the top right corner of the screen (strongNote:/strong emIf you don't click edit and instead only try to adjust the alert section from the main window, it will not give you the option to set up a second alert/em.)/li liScroll down to the Alert section; choose the time frame for your first alert/li liNow that you've set the first alert, you should see an option for 'Second Alert' below the original 'Alert' option (strongNote/strong: emThe 'Second Alert' option doesn't look like it exists until you set up the first alert/em)/li liChoose a time frame for the second alert and then click 'Done' in the top right hand corner of the screen/li /ul  <comment339846> Thanks but I'm on an iPad Pro and tapping on the event does not bring up an edit option anywhere. <comment339920> Also on my iPhone 5 while I can change the default alert there is no edit option on the top right of my screen and therefore no 2nd alert option brought up.
