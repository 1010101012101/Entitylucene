Editing Partition <body> When trying to edit a partition on my hard drive, codeDisk Utility/code says:  precodeCouldn't modify partition map because the file system verification failed. /code/pre  So I booted into single-user mode and typed in:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /code/pre  My computer then said:  precodeThe volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK. /code/pre  I boot back up and check with codeDisk Utility/code, but when I select the particular partition, it wont let me edit it in codeDisk Utility/code and have it verified. It tells me to repair it. I try to repair but codeDisk Utility/code can't repair this disk, and it needs to be reformatted. How would I go about doing this?  <answer99867> To format a disk in OS X:  ol liOpen Disk Utility./li liYou can format either at the partition-level, or disk-level. If you have multiple partitions on a disk, you can erase just one or more than one. If you want to start over and re-partition the disc, you can do that without erasing it first./li liOnce you have selected the disk or partition to format, click the Erase tab./li liChoose the type of disk format you want (generally you can stick with the default, `Mac OS Extended (Journaled)')./li liEnter a name for the formatted disk/partition./li liClick Erase./li /ol  To re-partition without erasing first:  ol liSelect the physical disk in the left-hand column. That is, the icon aligned to the left side of the window. Those indented are partitions on the physical disk. To re-partition you must have the physical disk selected.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UxEC2.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the Partition tab./li liSelect a Partition Layout from the drop-down menu./li liGive each partition a name./li liClick the Apply button./li /ol  <comment117521> Turns out you can reformat a single partition by using the erase functionality in disk utility <comment117523> user55685, please post your findings as an answer for other "Googlers" to see.
