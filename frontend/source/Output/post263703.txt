Terminal prompt changed <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j29je.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, I was trying to add Laravel to my list of executable commands and, somehow, I fudged up my iTerm 2 (and regular Terminal) and now they both appear like this.   precodeMacBook-Pro% /code/pre  That just looks ugly. How do I change back to what it once was? With the Git indicator, folder name, colors, etc.  <answer264935> precodenano .bash_profile /code/pre  Then add:  precodeexport PS1=" " /code/pre  Between those quotation marks, add any of the following between the quotation marks of export PS1=" ":  precode\d – Current date \t – Current time \h – Host name \# – Command number \u – User name \W – Current working directory (ie: Desktop/) \w – Current working directory with full path (ie: /Users/Admin/Desktop/) /code/pre  Also you can customize the look and feel of terminal, or restore the defaults in Terminal  Preferences  Profiles  http://osxdaily.com/2006/12/11/how-to-customize-your-terminal-prompt/
