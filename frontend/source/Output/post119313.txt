Why does my keyboard language switch on website password fields? <body> Using a Mac with Mavericks, I have keyboard setup to Hebrew. Then, when I click in the password field, it switches it back to English and Hebrew is disabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ycIuw.png" height="350" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A1ZQI.png" height="350"  I saw that another question says to remove the keyboards, but I need to keep both Hebrew and US input methods active. I don't use quicksilver and wonder if something else might cause this problem on Mavericks?  <answer122350> After doing a little bit of testing, I think it's because of this option is enabled in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongInput Sources/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uV6Sn.png" alt="Automatically switch to a document&#39;s input source"  It's checked by default and since cbs.com is in English, OS X will automatically change the input source to English (If you don't have English, or whatever language the page is in,  enabled, it seems it'll just select your default input source â€” i.e. the one at the top of the list in strongInput Sources/strong).  I tested with Hebrew and Danish enabled and when focusing a textfield OS X changed my keyboard layout to Danish emwith/em auto-switch enabled and emdidn't/em with it disabled.  At least in my case, the swithcing wasn't limited to password fields specifically (which makes sense). The behaviour is the same in both Chrome and Safari.  <comment140672> Is this independent of your browser? I have noticed that Mavericks auto changes the keyboard layout to your system locale when entering passwords in the user login window. Maybe the same happens in Safari now... <comment150118> I observe the same behaviour when using chrome. However, it did not happen in safari nor firefox (same settings and same website). <comment150120> I found a fix presented in [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6810/) related question.
