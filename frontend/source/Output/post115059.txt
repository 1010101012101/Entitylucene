Bootcamp on windows 8 - use windows 8 volume OSD <body> When I use windows 8, there are Windows 8 builtin fancy OSD's for brightness and volume. However, when I use windows 8 on my macbook(Bootcamp drivers installed) and I change volume I get the Mac OSD for volume, which I don't like, as it doesn't show on top of apps. The brightness OSD is the windows 8 OSD, just how I like it. How can I disable this Mac OSD and use the Windows 8 volume OSD instead?
