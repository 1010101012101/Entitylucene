How to choose which FaceTime number to call <body> I have a friend with two iPhones, two different numbers.  When I call her with FaceTime audio, only phone A rings.  How can I call phone B?  The phones have two separate Apple ID addresses, but they are both set to receive Facetime calls on their 10 digit phone numbers.  I have both numbers listed in my contacts as 'Home' and 'Work' for the same person.  <answer121747> I'm not sure there is a standard way. It certainly isn't easy to find by using the Contacts or the Facetime app. But, it can be done:  ol liSend a text message to the specific number you want to Facetime call./li liOpen the conversation thread./li liClick "Contact" in the top right./li liClick the symbol for calling./li liChoose "FaceTime Audio"./li /ol  <comment141943> Please see the edits I made to the question just now. <comment178139> You would likely need to set up two separate contacts in order to call the second phone. <comment313997> I didn't find a decent way either. When a contact has more than one phone number it looks like it is the first one in `Contacts` which is choosen. <comment313999> Still a pretty relevant question. Everyone can't duplicate all one's contacts just to be able to choose which one to use.
