Is there something missing? Does Apple require something further?  hr  h2Update 1:/h2  @TheDarkKnight has suggested that I am using the incorrect certificate to sign the code.app/code. Looks as though they are correct, so I went to create a new codeDeveloper ID Application certificate/code but apparently because I am not an 'Agent' in the group account, so I now have to wait until the 'Agent' creates one for me - seems backwards, is there no other way around waiting for the 'Agent' to make this for me?     (in Xcode) If the "Developer ID" radio button is greyed out you probably have a group account. strongThese types of accounts only allow for the "Agent" role to create Developer IDs./strong Contact the person who created your group Apple Developer Account if you get stuck here.   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Signing_Mozilla_apps_for_Mac_OS_X  hr  h2Update 2:/h2  So I finally got my new cert today, re-signed the code.app/code, downloaded it from the server ran and strongSTILL GOT THE ERROR MESSAGE/strong.

So, let's start by double-checking how you're validating your app.  strongValidate your app/strong  To validate a Developer ID-signed app, follow these steps:  ol liIn Xcode go to Product  Archive/li liThe Archives organizer window will appear/li liSelect the archive for the app in question/li liClick on the kbdValidate/kbd button/li liA dialogue box appears asking you to select a method for validation/li liSelect the emValidate a Developer ID-signed Application/em option/li liClick on kbdNext/kbd/li liIn the next window select a team from the pop-up menu/li liClick on kbdChoose/kbd/li liClick the kbdValidate/kbd button/li /ol  This will identify any validation issues. If any are found, this will be your problem (or at least part of it), so you will need to resolve this.  If no issues are found, then proceed below.  strongExport a Developer ID-signed app/strong  ol liStill within the Archives organizer window, select the archive for the app in question/li liClick on the kbdExport/kbd button/li liA dialogue box appears asking you to select a method for export/li liSelect the emExport a Developer ID-signed Application/em option/li liClick on kbdNext/kbd/li liIn the next window select a team from the pop-up menu/li liClick on kbdChoose/kbd/li liClick the kbdExport/kbd button/li /ol  Once your app is exported you should test with Gatekeeper enabled and again with Gatekeeper disabled.  <comment354018> Is the application embedded in a code signed disk image, `DMG`, when downloaded? What version of macOS are you testing on? <comment354022> @GrahamMiln I'll have to get back to you on the macOS version. I did not sign the `.dmg`, do you have to sign that as well? I was using https://successfulsoftware.net/2012/08/30/how-to-sign-your-mac-os-x-app-for-gatekeeper/ as reference and they state that the `.dmg` does not require additional signing so I did not sign it. <comment354031> See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9743116/gatekeeper-signing-for-osx-dmgs-outside-of-osx-xcode-mac-app-store and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23824815/how-to-add-codesigning-to-dmg-file-in-mac#37923530 <comment354032> Try testing the signature with: `spctl -vvv -a -t open --context context:primary-signature full path to app or dmg` <comment354044> @GrahamMiln Thanks for the comments, I will get back to you on this in the morning! <comment359947> Are you trying to distribute your app as part of an installer package? <comment359948> @Monomeeth No, the user will just get the app in a .zip. (It's rudementary, but it's what was requested.) <comment359966> Thanks for the answer, I will attempt this as soon as possible. <comment359990> hey, i dunno if you've tried yet but AppleCare has a developer support team & from what i remember they don't really turn anybody that has a developer account away. i'm sure they would be able to offer some kind of help
