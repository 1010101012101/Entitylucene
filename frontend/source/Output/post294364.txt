How do I AirDrop from a MacBook to its tethered iPhone? <body> My MacBook (OSX Yosemite 10.10.5) is tethered to my iPhone (10.0.2) in order to provide Internet access.  How do I AirDrop strongfrom/strong my Macbook strongto/strong an app on my iPhone?  Currently I have to use Dropbox, ie. move the file into Dropbox, wait for the (possibly large file) to upload, then download it on my iPhone to the desired app (causing another sync).  <answer294379> You will need to turn off strongPersonal Hotspot/strong before you can AirDrop.  strongAirDrop/strong transfers data over Wi-Fi between the two peer devices (in this case, your MacBook and your iPhone). Since your iPhone is providing a strongPersonal Hotspot/strong via Wi-Fi, that connection is not available for AirDrop.  If turning Personal Hotspot off and on repeatedly is too cumbersome, you can provide tethering through USB instead. Then your Wi-Fi connection will always be available for AirDrop.  <answer294420> Like Phong said, you will need to turn off your Personal Hotspot before you can AirDrop since it is using the network from your phone. However your MacBook does not need to be on a Wi-Fi network in order to send or receive files through AirDrop. As long as emboth Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are on on both of your devices/em, it can send the files without being connected to each other or the internet.  To send things through AirDrop on your Mac, simply strongright-click/strong on the file(s) you want to send, mouse over strongshare/strong, then click on strongAirDrop/strong. Then once your iPhone shows up, click strongsend/strong and click strongaccept/strong on your iPhone.

You donâ€™t need a network either to airdrop. <comment371557> Something to keep in mind is that if you have personal hotspot on, the device that is supplying that hotspot will not be able to send or receive via airdrop
