iPhone 6 restored from encrypted iPhone 5S backup doesn't retain passwords <body> I have a new iPhone 6. It is replacing an iPhone 5S. I plug this into my iMac every day via an original Apple Lightning cable, and iTunes automatically creates strongencrypted/strong backups.  I have successfully restored half-a-dozen iPhones in the past from encrypted backups. However, this time the iPhone 6 is requiring all my app and email passwords to be manually re-entered.  Why were my passwords not retained when I restored from the encrypted backup?  strongAny ideas how I can force a successful restore emincluding passwords/em?/strong  Possible quirks which may have contributed to this problem:  ol liI had upgraded the 5S to iOS 8.1 before I first tried restoring. The 6 was shipped with an earlier version, so I needed to update to 8.1 before I could attempt to restore my backup to it./li liWhen I tried to restore from a backup the transfer process would hang when transferring apps. I was eventually able to avoid that problem by disabling sync over Wi-Fi first./li /ol  (For reasons that leave me completely bamboozled, when I have tried to manually enter email account passwords by copying the passwords stored in my iMac's Keychain, emsome/em of them are being rejected. I presume this is simply operator error, but can't work out whether it's a failure to transpose correctly, or a failure to identify the correct password in the first place.)  <answer163140> I just have had the same issue when I try to restore 5S backup into 6. After a few attempts, it eventually worked fine. Here's what I did for the successful try:  ul liTake old iPhone backup with encryption on/li liReset all content / all settings on new iPhone without connection to PC / Mac/li liGo through startup config on new iPhone until you see "Set Up iPhone" screen, which let you select the options to restore from iCloud / iTunes backup/li liSelect "Restore from iTunes backup"/li liConnect to PC/Mac and select backup you want to restore/li liDone!/li /ul  It wasn't successful when I tried to restore without reset, or without going through startup config. Hope this helps  <comment190938> So, resetting to factory defaults is the key to password retainment? <comment191511> I believe the key on my case was to go through startup config on new iPhone (until you see "Set Up iPhone" screen)
