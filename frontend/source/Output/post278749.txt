Macbook pro ox sierra Excel on office 2016 <body> for months since I and my college started using Excel (2016), our old documents layout opened with the columns' with smaller and the entire lay out of our pages messed up.  I would fix the layout until getting it right for proper printing (regular US letter size). Then I would share it with my college (also a mac book same OX) the document format would be mess up again (back to square one)  I have tried everything I could think off, looked endlessly online for fixes have not found solution. It seams to me that clearly, the Excel files don't remember the setting for column widths and when opened on a different computer even the same platform, Excel resets that formatting.      So many other problems with this real bad update of Office, all worked fine on previous version.  Any ideas please?      <comment350870> Which version of Excel 2016 are you using? Not just the exact version number, but also whether it's an Office 365 subscription you're using or a one time purchase? Finally, what version of macOS are the MacBooks using?
