Why won't wget work with cron? <body> I've been using the bashpodder script recently, and while the script works beautifully when I use it in the command line, the crontab I created for it doesn't work at all. It fails when it has to use wget. I downloaded the most recent OS X binaries for wget, but the script still fails, and I get a log with an error that reads thus:  precodeUsers/username/Downloads/audio/podcasts/bashpodder.shell: line 73: wget: command not found /code/pre  Lines 71-75 read like this:  precodeif ! grep "$url" podcast.log &gt; /dev/null       then          wget -t 10 -U BashPodder -c -q -O $datadir/$(echo "$url"  | awk -F'/' {'print $NF'}  |  awk -F'='         {'print $NF'} | awk -F'?' {'print $1'}) "$url"          let "show += 1"     fi /code/pre  Any recommendations?  <answer9710> codewget/code isn't in the default path used by codecron/code. Give it the code/full/path/to/wget/code and it should work.  <comment10195> That worked perfectly; thanks! <comment91716> Set PATH in the shell file also wroks.
