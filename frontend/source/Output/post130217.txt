2006 Mac Pro - vmware fusion - snow leopard / VM's with Mavericks <body> Can a 2006 Mac Pro that can't go above Snow Leopard physically on the host run Mavericks with vmware Fusion virtually?  <answer130224> I'm guessing you can, and here's why (from VirtualBox):     VirtualBox supports 64-bit guest operating systems, even on 32-bit host operating systems provided that the following conditions are met:      ol   listrongYou need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support (see Section 10.3, “Hardware vs. software virtualization”)./strong/li   liYou must enable hardware virtualization for the particular VM for which you want 64-bit support; software virtualization is not supported for 64-bit VMs./li   liIf you want to use 64-bit guest support on a 32-bit host operating system, you must also select a 64-bit operating system for the particular VM. Since supporting 64 bits on 32-bit hosts incurs additional overhead, VirtualBox only enables this support upon explicit request./li   /ol   VMWare Fusion says something similar (search the FAQ for "64-bit").  Assuming your Mac Pro is the 2.66 Quad Core, EveryMac confirms that your processor is 64-bit.  Give it a try, hit the forums, and good luck!
