What iPad app can I use to manage the locations where I took some photos? <body> I use iPhoto on the Mac and it can show a map with all the locations where I took photos. Is there a similar app on the iPad? With a map I can zoom in and outâ€¦  <answer102682> You might be interested in one of this choices:  my favorite  MapProjector with Google Maps  Features:  ul liCreate an unlimited number of maps with unlimited landmarks/li liPhotos - Import photos from your Photo Album using their own locations./li /ul  Exif Wizard  Then there is the iPhoto app for iPad :)  <comment120844> Just like iPhoto on iOS, exif wizard lets you inspect one photo's location on a map, but not map various photos on the same map. One map with all the locations of photos is the goal here I believe. <comment120867> @bmike You are so right, so I expanded my answer with few more options. <comment120872> MapProjector is exactly what i'm looking for. Please edit your answer to add it at the top, and i'll accept it. Thank you!
