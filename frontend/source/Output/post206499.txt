When using Keynote on an external display and turning off mirroring, my desktop disappears <body> I want to be able to use Presenter Display on my laptop when it is connected to an LCD projector. When I turn off mirroring in display preferences, my desktop disappears and there is no way to start keynote.  <comment249259> It appears that the Mac is using the projector as the main screen, but we need more information.  What versions of OS X and Keynote?  What method do you use to connect to the projector? (VGA, HDMI, DVI? Don't know?)  Welcome to Ask Different. <comment249606> I am using a MacBook Air with Yosemite. Keynote '09. <comment249623> How do you have it connected?
