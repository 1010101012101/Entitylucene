Can I use FaceTime video with an MacBook and email address only? <body> I have a MacBook and set up FaceTime with an Apple ID, email only.  I can call from the MacBook FaceTime to another iPhone FaceTime user.  However, the iPhone FaceTime cannot make call the to MacBook's FaceTime, as the video icon is dimmed.   Is email-only FaceTime a/c not good for receiving video calls?  <answer268479> You need to add your email account in your Macbook's FaceTime app and then get it verified from the verification email that you will receive.  <comment337069> should work! Make sure FaceTime is enabled for your email address in FaceTime app - Preferences. <comment337082> The email on Mac's Facetime is enabled. However, when I add the email as a new contact into my iPhone, the new contact in iPhone does not have the video option (the "video" button is disabled). <comment337317> Added, verified.
