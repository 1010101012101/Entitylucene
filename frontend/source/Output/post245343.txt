Dock won't appear on other displays <body> I know, you can't have the dock on both screens at the same time, and I know that there's a 'swipe down' gesture I'm supposed to be able to do with the mouse to make the dock appear. I just can't seem to get that to work, though... I've done this before on other computers.   Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11) clean install done yesterday.  <answer245350> You can also fix the dock on a other screen:  ol liGo to System Preferences/li liClick on Displays/li liClick on Arrangement/li liSwipe the white bar from one screen to the other/li /ol  If this won't work, also check the alt + cmd + d keycombination to show / hide the dock.
