Messages beta hangs. How to remove it or at least its accounts? <body> I've received a huge iMessage and now the App hangs. I can't remove the App, because it's only possible via the menu item which is not responding. Removing code~/Documents/iChat/*/code and code~/Library/Messages/*/code didn't help either.  Any ideas of how to remove it or at least its accounts?  <answer50937> Try this:  ol liNavigate to code/Applications//code/li liRight-Click on emMessages.app/em/li liChoose emGet Info/em and stronguncheck/strong the option to emOpen in 32-bit Mode/em./li /ol  Messages should open normally, and then you can Uninstall as usual.  <answer50939> Messages always hang on my Mac as well, error telling me no account set up etc, and restarting my Mac always helps to bring it back to normal.  <answer51080> I had to remove codecom.apple.iChat/code and codecom.apple.Messages/code in code~/Library/Caches/code to get it working normally.  <comment58396> This is already unchecked and didn't helped. The problem was the message flood. <comment58493> And how does this relate to the specific issue (big iMessage) raised in the question?
