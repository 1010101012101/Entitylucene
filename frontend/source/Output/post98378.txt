Why has my Help Center been reduced to this-'The selected topic is currently unavailable'? <body> My iMac used to be a valuable information, and learning tool for me… then I made the fatal mistake of upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion. What a disaster! The Help Center and all other 'help' menus at some level end up with this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9gkQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have searched, and found that many other people have had the same problem. Some recon it is certain files like com.apple.helpd that have corrupted, others say it is due to a problem with ISP Satellite connections. Whatever it is, I haven't been able to fix it. A 'clean' re-install made no difference.  Apart from all the help menus on all applications fail as soon as it needs info from the internet, I have no problem using the internet at all with any other applications (Safari, Mail, etc.)  Does anyone have a definite answer that could fix this problem once and for all?  strongUpdate:/strong  As requested by sameetandpotatoes in his answer, here is the relevant outputs of console.log:  precode21/08/13 5:23:29.328 PM helpd[643]: Could not find access page in directory /Applications/Debut.app/Contents/Resources/help 21/08/13 5:23:29.343 PM helpd[643]: Could not find access page in directory /Applications/Debut.app/Contents/Resources/help 21/08/13 5:23:31.199 PM com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.coremedia.videodecoder[2962]) Exit timeout elapsed (20 seconds).

(line: 0) /code/pre  <answer99548> h2Reset Help center/h2  Most Help Center problems are the result of corrupted Help Center cache or preferences files. The following steps should resolve such problems. Note that these instructions cover multiple versions of Mac OS X: you may have only some of the files or folders cited for deletion.  ol liClose or quit codeHelp Center/code if it is open./li liClick the red Close button in the upper-left corner of the Help Center window./li liTrash the following files in your Home  Library  Preferences folder, if they exist:  precode    com.apple.help.plist     com.apple.helpd.plist     com.apple.helpviewer.plist  /code/pre/li liTrash the following folders in your Home  Library  Caches folder, if they exist:  precode    com.apple.helpd folder     com.apple.helpviewer folder /code/pre/li liEmpty the Trash. If you receive an alert stating that the Trash cannot be emptied "because the item Cache.db is in use," then terminate the helpd process using Activity Monitor. The helpd (help dameon) is a process that provides various services to Help Viewer./li /ol  h2Next Step (if the above doesn't work)/h2  Enable Help Center logging.  ol liQuit (kbd⌘/kbd + kbdQ/kbd) Help Viewer if it is open./li liLaunch Terminal, which is located in the Macintosh HD  Applications  Utilities folder./li liAt the Terminal prompt, copy this command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.helpviewer HelpViewerDebugging -bool YES  /code/pre/li liPress kbdEnter/kbd./li liClose Terminal or (kbd⌘/kbd + kbdQ/kbd)./li liLaunch Help Center by selecting Finder  Help  Help Center. All Help Center actions will be logged in console.log, which you can access via Console. Note that Help Center logging will write a lot to the console.log. /li /ol  Edit your question and include the relevant outputs of codeconsole.log/code.  hr  hr  h2Update/h2  Steve, I'm including this as an update because it would have been too long as a comment.  ol liDo you have the OS X installer dmg for Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion? If yes, you could use Pacifist to extract files that are necessary for Help Center. (By "clean re-install", do you mean you wiped your computer and reinstalled the OS?)/li liIn  regards to the codeconsole.log/code, the codeevent.layerX and event.layerY/code has to do with jQuery for a web browser (Chrome I think?). I know that it is not related to the codeHelp Center/code in any way. The first few lines:  precodeCould not find access page in directory /Applications/Debut.app/Contents/Resources/help 21/08/13 5:23:29.343 PM helpd[643] /code/pre/li /ol  mean that the code.help/code files are missing in your applications (Debut and SketchbookExpress).  This is the best link I can find in regards to Help Center, although it is deprecated and meant for older versions (This is where I got the steps to reset codeHelp Center/code. I've went through it already but take another look.     Help books are installed in one of two ways:  precode1. Directly in the Macintosh HD &gt; Library &gt; Documentation &gt; Help folder. 2. Distributed as part of an application's package file and contained within the package of the application for which the help book provides help information. /code/pre   Check that file path and see if you have help books in Library = Documentation = Help. For instance, I have:  precodeAppleScript.help - 859 KB HelpCenter.help - 1.6 MB MacHelp.help - 21.4 MB VoiceOver.help- 1.4 MB /code/pre  If you don't have those files, or they are empty or something, you may want to redownload those (This is where Pacifist might come in handy).  As for the second way that help books are installed, it seems that you are missing it for codeDebut.app/code and codeSketchbookExpress.app/code. I am not sure how you would resolve this, maybe reinstall the application? What happens if you redownload the application, codedouble click/code and click codeShow Package Contents/code and then copy the codehelp/code folder from the downloaded application to your installed application?  <comment116578> If you create a new account and log in, does help work on that account? <comment116579> @DanielLawson, wow, a response, thank you.:) I've never created a new account before so it will take me a little while to figure it out. <comment116582> @DanielLawson, The answer is no, help doesn't work on the new account. <comment116937> There's a free app called onyx that can be used to clear out your help cache and rebuild it.  Have you  tried something like that? http://www.titanium.free.fr/   If that doesn't work, then move onto network issues, dns, ports, firewall, etc. <comment117043> Are you saying if you connect your Mac to the internet and can browse sites, when you enter "wallpaper" into the Finder help - it doesn't then download some articles locally and then show you between 2 and 15 articles? <comment117099> @bmike, My internet connection works fine, the computer is permanently connected. The problem lies with the Help Menus of all applications, including Finder (regardless of whether I'm on the 'net' or not). Some local help info is available, but as soon as help is required from the internet, it comes up with the 'unavailable' message (see it in my question). <comment117127> I was advised to do something very similar to this about 4 months ago - it had no effect. I'm prepared to try what you suggest, but I'm concerned about stuffing things up even more! :-[ How safe is it? <comment117129> It is safe because it is just removing the cached version of it. When you open Help Center, it will rebuild the caches. Besides, it can't get any worse than what you already have :). Just remember to remove only the `plists` and folders that I specified, nothing else. <comment117135> Reset Help Center didn't work so I have added the outputs of console.log to my question. It looks a bit of a mess! Note: This includes quitting Help Center. <comment117161> SteveW, please see my update above. <comment117359> I do have the installers for both Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion. Yes, I erased the entire hard drive before re-install. I do use Chrome. I don't use Debut or SketchbookExpress so their help files would probably become available if I was to open them again (this info would have been dumped when I reset the Help Center I think). I have exactly the same files as you in my Library  Documentation  Help folder. Thanks for all your help, but I don't think we are on the right track here so I am now seeking the help of an Apple technician.
