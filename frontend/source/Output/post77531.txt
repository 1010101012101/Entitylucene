Apple Automator Question Copy and Paste <body> How would I copy all of the text from a powerpoint presentation and paste it into a word document?  <answer83749> Simple. Try the following workflow:   ol liAsk for Finder Items/li liConvert Format of Powerpoint Presentations    New Format: Outline (Rich Text Format)/li liMove Finder Items    To: Desktop (or as you wish)/li /ol  This should work.   I tested it. Then right click on the RTF and open with MS Word.  Here it is for you to download Powerpoint to RTF workflow.  <comment89842> If I remember correct pptx files are sort of archives. Maybe you can unpack it and there is a text file containing all the text. Not sure though. <comment89849> It's a zip full of XML files <comment89851> I can imagine a way in which only the body text is extracted from the XML's but it involves some coding and I would have no clue how to do that in Automator.
