Although my GUID_partition_scheme shows I have 500 gigs on the disk, the space is just gone and no longer able to be expanded to the "Macintosh HD" partition. I tried rebooting but nothing seems to work. Any ideas?  <answer250685> Under these circumstances - only one main volume - the proper command to expand it to its full size is:  precodediskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 R /code/pre  This command will not work if your main volume is part of a CoreStorage Volume Group.  <comment311367> @user3439894 It says, "No CoreStorage logical volume groups found" and Disk Utility wouldn't let me delete them, so its not like I had any other choice. <comment311369> @Midi, Did you try using `diskutil` from Terminal vs the Disk Utility app to remove what you deleted with `gdisk` before resorting to it? <comment311371> @user3439894 Yes, I tried both. <comment311374> @klanomath So any ideas? <comment311376> @klanomath If you add it to the answers, then I'll select it if you want. Thanks. <comment311379> @klanomath indeed
