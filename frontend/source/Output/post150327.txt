SSD Disk Utility & Install Failure <body> I've been running a SanDisk 256GB SSD for about a year. A week ago my system locked up and stopped being able to boot from the SSD.   Booted from 10.9 USB installer, and went to disk utility, located the drive, and tried to create the partition.   It took about an hour to create the partition. The OS X installer never gets further than 0%.   I took out the SSD and put in the old HD.   The system ran fine. I've been running off the HD for a week while i placed an ARMA with sandisk.   This weekend i got the replacement SSD and went to load up OS X.   This same behavior occurs on the new SSD. (Slow to partition / 0% on the installer)  I've re-downloaded the 10.9 installer and used a different USB drive. Same results on both drives.   The old platter HD still works correctly on the same SATA connection.   Anything else i should try?
