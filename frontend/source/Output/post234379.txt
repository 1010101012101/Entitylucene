Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Keyboard not able to connect on reboot <body> I've just gotten a new iMac 27" 5k (Late 2015). Works great, apart from one minor, yet annoying issue. Whenever I reboot, it seems bot my mouse and keyboard are not working once presented with the login screen.  I can sort of solve this doing the following:  ol liWhen at the login screen, I plugin the usb cable in my keyboard and it (and only it - not the mouse) gets responsive. From there, I can either login and reboot or reboot directly./li liOnce the machine has rebooted and the "boot up sound" has played, I remove the cable./li liWhen at the login screen, both the mouse and keyboard are now working again. /li /ol  Has anyone ever encountered this issue before? It's     really cumbersome to repeat this procedure every time I do a reboot.  My system overview:  ul liOS X El Capitan v. 10.11.4/li liProcessor: 4GHz Intel Core i7/li liMemory: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3/li liAMD Radeon R9 M390 2048 MB/li /ul  <answer234402> Reseting the NVRAM seems to solve the issue.  Here is the procedure.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063  <comment286614> Finally! Guess something has gone wrong during the initial setup process. Anyway, all god now. Thank you!
