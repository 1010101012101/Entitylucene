SFTP access to OSX stopped working <body> I have enabled codeRemote Login/code in System Preferences in order to sftp files from my Macbook to my android devices. On those I have AndFTP installed and it used to work without problem. Now I don't think I've done anything to my system lately, but I am no longer able to connect to the Macbook, neither from my phone nor my tablet, both with Android 7.   ul licodesftp localhost/code works/li liThe other direction (FTPServer App on Android), FileZilla on the Mac stopped working as well. Upon connection, the server says code500 SSH-2.0-PUTTY_LOCAL:_MAR_20_2017_16:50:29 not understood/code. I am confused as to the obsolete date in this message, but understand nothing else about it. /li liI have updated my phone to android 7, but the tablet shows the same behaviour/li liusing codesftp/code from the command line to sftp into android also does not work, the server has gives the same 500 error just with a different client string/li /ul  What tools can I use on macOS or Android to debug this problem?  <comment353115> Already answered [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1199633/what-can-i-do-about-a-500-ssh-not-understood-error) <comment353213> That thread is more about the other direction, not phone to laptop. <comment353277> Certainly you should not connect with one protocol to the other. <comment353438> Have you check that the date and time is correctly set on both devices? SSL requires the date to be set fairly correctly and a bad date on either device would explain the error message date.
