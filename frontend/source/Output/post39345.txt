Can I view system stats in the Terminal? <body> The widget iStat Pro allows to monitor different system stats like  ul liCPU usage/li linetwork bandwidth in/out /li limemory usage/li li.../li /ul  How can I view such system stats in the Terminal?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9liHO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer39346> You can use codetop/code. It'll show CPU &amp; RAM usage together with all the processes. It'll also show you network packets in/out, and discs data read/written.  <answer39351> Depending on what you want to see, there are several options on Terminal level:  ul licodetop/code: show running processes, memory usage and similar stats/li licodeiostat/code: show I/O per terminal, device and SPU summery statistics/li licodevm_stat/code: show Mach virtual memory statistics/li licodedf/code and codediskutil list/code: report on drive space used and free/li licodefs_usage/code: show file activity for both disk and network/li licodenettop/code: display updated information about the network (a bit like top for net I/O)/li licodew/code: display who is logged in, what they are doing and system load/li licodeifconfig/code and codeipconfig/code: network interface and IP protocol details/li /ul  Most of these commands have a huge list of options, it's probably best to consult the man pages for details.  I usually rely on codetop -u -s 10/code to identify CPU-hogging processes and codefs_usage -f filesys/code/codefs_usage -f network/code to identify processes generating a lot of disk/network load.  <answer39835> The above are great commands.  Also, I like to use  precodedu -ks * /code/pre  To show how much disk space all the folders below my current directory are using.  <answer39843> If you are having network problems, especially with a server exposed to the Internet, lsof(1) can be extremely useful. It lists all open files.  For example, codelsof | fgrep '/Library/WebServer//code will show you all the files that are open on your web server. I've been using this a lot to find and ban "leeches" and "bots" who are reducing my bandwidth by automatically sucking down file after file.  <answer41436> Here are two commands for determining your local and public IP:  h3Local IP/h3  precodeipconfig getifaddr en1 /code/pre  This is when using Wi-Fi. For ethernet use codeen0/code.  h3Public IP/h3  precodecurl whatismyip.org /code/pre  <answer253066> The iStats ruby gem lets you see the CPU temperature via the command-line.  h3Installation/h3  code$ gem install iStats/code  h3Usage/h3  code$ istats/code  img src="https://i.imgur.com/KMAIRkD.png" alt="Screenshot"  <comment44497> And with `man top` you can see how to customize the output. <comment44520> This is what I wanted! Thanks. <comment47069> On current MacBook Airs (which don't have an ethernet port) the Wi-Fi device code is `en0`. You can find out what it is with `networksetup -listallhardwareports | grep -E '(Wi-Fi|AirPort)' -A 1 | grep -o "en."`. <comment299057> @JMY1000 LOL, I actually like the idea of a process *hugging* the CPU :-) Thanks for the edit. <comment299221> @patrix Ah, the good ol' hug of death.
