Safari fails to recognise changes to /etc/hosts but Paw, Chrome, and Postman work fine <body> I'm running a test Api server on my local Mac (macOS Sierra).  I've added  precode127.0.0.1 api.local ::1 api.local /code/pre  to my codeetc/hosts/code file.  Connecting with codecurl/code works  precodecurl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"redacted"}' https://api.local/v3/auth /code/pre  gives back  precode{"token":"redacted.jwt.string","role":"Admin"}} /code/pre  but making the same connection via javascript in Safari just times out.  It seems like Safari is not respecting the entry in the codeetc/hosts/code file.  precodedscacheutil -q host -a name api.local /code/pre  responds with  precodename: api.local ipv6_address: ::1  name: api.local ip_address: 127.0.0.1 /code/pre  Curl, Chrome, Postman, and Paw strongdo/strong work but Safari doesn't. Why would that be?
