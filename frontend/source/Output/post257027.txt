Filtering Live Photos <body> Is it possible to setup a strongSmart Album/strong in the strongPhotos/strong app that would group all Live Photos? Neither app seems to provide a quick way to find all your Live Photos.  <answer284708> Starting with macOS Sierra 10.12.3, Apple has added a emLive Photos/em Smart Album to strongPhotos/strong. It may be accessed from the strongSidebar/strong (strongView/strong → strongShow Sidebar/strong) or in strongAlbums/strong view (strongView/strong → strongAlbums/strong).  It is still not possible to setup a emcustom/em Smart Album with codeLive Photo/code as a criterion.
