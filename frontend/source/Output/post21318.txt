How to set already-paired bluetooth devices again into discovery mode? <body> How can I set a Magic Trackpad (or, any other bluetooth device, I guess) into discovery mode, if it has already been paired to another mac?  Anything I find on google just mocks me.  <answer21328> I don't think the magic trackpad (or the magic mouse) have a "discovery mode." Just make sure the bluetooth on the Mac it was previously paired to is off, then go about connecting it to the new Mac as normal.  Apple's support page on this  <answer21340> (I took the Magic Trackpad for example, but it applies to Apple Bluetooth keyboard and Magic Mouse as well)  When you start a Magic Trackpad, it announces itself over bluetooth :  ul liIf a Mac "hear" it and is paired with it, they connect each other and you can't use the Magic Trackpad with another Mac./li liIf no previously paired Mac are near the Magic Trackpad, it will be available to a new pairing./li /ul  So, one Magic Trackpad can be paired to multiple computers. When you start it, the first computer to connect to it gets it (first arrived, first served).  If you have two Macs next to each other (emA/em &amp; emB/em), your Magic Trackpad paired to emA/em and you want to pair it with emB/em, you have four choices :  ul liUnpair your Magic Trackpad from emA/em/li liDisable bluetooth on emA/em (this can be painful if you only have bluetooth input devices for emA/em)/li liTake emA/em or emB/em far (Â±10 meters) from the other. Stop your Magic Trackpad and start it again near emB/em./li liShutdown emA/em/li /ul  Once done, you can start a new pairing procedure on emB/em.  I hope it answers your question.  hr  (you can also stop and start again your Magic Trackpad while detecting new bluetooth devices on emB/em and hope emB/em will find it faster than emA/em, but you'll probably need to make that several times before getting it to work)  <answer74775> I just did this.  You put your trackpad or keyboard into discovery mode by holding the power key until the green light is blinking.  The mac mini recognizes the trackpad almost immediately, and then walks you through the process of connecting your keyboard.  Keyboard does not need to be in discovery mode, only needs to be powered on.  Took 2 min, very simple.  Don't waste any money or space on a USB keyboard!  <answer147052> Follow these instructions:  ol liTurn off the trackpad by holding down the power button until the light goes out./li liTurn on the trackpad by pressing the power button, strongand keep the power button pressed until it is paired./strong The light on the mouse will start blinking, it will show up in Bluetooth Preferences, and you will be able to pair it almost immediately so long as you  strongdo not let go of the power button from the moment of turning it on until after the trackpad is paired./strong/li /ol  <answer181549> Regarding the Magic Mouse you can kick it into discovery mode by holding down the mouse button, switch the mouse on, keep on holding the mouse button until the green light starts blinking!  <answer291166> The other answers apply to the original Magic Mouse. However, the Magic Mouse 2 (with the Lightning port for charging) does not have a green light or pairing mode. To pair an already-paired Magic Mouse 2, you will need to plug the mouse into the Lighting-to-USB cable and connect directly to the Mac.  (TIL that the connection must be DIRECTLY to the Mac and not via a hub such as a Thunderbolt Display.)  <answer294637> MAGIC MOUSE 2 HAS A DISCOVERY MODE Here's how you do it:  ol liturn the mouse off/li lipress the click button and hold it pressed/li liturn on the mouse/li ligo to mouse utility on the mac and search for a mouse. you will find it/li liconnect to the mouse/li lirelease the click button/li /ol  <comment23351> Will this be when you are near the Mac it is already paired to? <comment23544> I guess you three are right: it was distant enough from the already-paired one that I didn't even consider it was connecting to it... I guess I was wrong. <comment24257> The devices should enter discovery mode as indicated by flashing of the green LED - you can force it by holding the power button longer when you turn it on - releasing when you see it flashing. +1 great article link <comment24259> Can't you just hold the power button while powering on to force the device into discovery mode? I agree it's better to not have another device paired, but I've been able to temporarily shift things in the past using a keyboard once with an iPad. <comment24261> I think it still can be "catched" by a paired Mac but I should try to be sure. Will post here if I do so. <comment251102> This is what I've been looking for - thanks! They should make this clear on the Apple website <comment279886> "Shutdown A" is probably the easiest and best option, and I guess you could put it on top of your list because it would work for most people. Moving desktop computers isn't very easy. <comment310836> +1 this is correct and what I was looking for <comment330748> This is the correct answer. In an office of 70 people I can't go around asking how is paired to this mouse already. :)
