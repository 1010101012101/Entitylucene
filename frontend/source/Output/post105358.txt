How do I configure Aperture to upload image location information to Facebook? <body> All of the discussion I can find online suggests that an image in Aperture with location information that is uploaded to Facebook (using Aperture's Facebook integration) should have a location assigned in Facebook. But all my attempts to get image location information from Aperture to Facebook have failed.  How do I configure Aperture to upload image location information to Facebook? Is this feature in fact supported?  hr  Note that the Aperture Export setting to allow export of location information is enabled.  <comment125626> did you find any answer to this? I am having the same problem and could use some pointers... Facebook doesn't seem to read any location data from Aperture <comment125627> What version of aperture and what version of OSX? <comment125649> @bmike: Was 10.8 and whatever version of Aperture was current prior to the latest. Hold on and let me confirm that this persists with 10.9. <comment125683> @bmike: Continues in 10.9 / 3.5.
