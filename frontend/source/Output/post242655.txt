Problem "do shell script" on curl – Works in Terminal, but not via "do shell script" <body> I want to use "curl" with "do shell script" in an apple script. It already worked some months ago, but then the provider changed to https-only service.  So I update curl on Mac OS Terminal:  precode$ curl -V curl 7.49.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0) libcurl/7.49.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2h zlib/1.2.8 Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp  Features: IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz TLS-SRP UnixSockets /code/pre  So it works in Terminal and gives back the right answer: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WBdis.png" alt="enter image description here"  But when I try to call the same command via do shell script in Apple Script it responds this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9nAUu.png" alt="enter image description here"  So – is the problem, that curl in the do shell script environment isn't updated - and how could I do this? Or what is the problem?  <answer242826> I've found the solution. The problem is, that homebrew installed an optional newer version of curl, but the command codedo shell script/code does use the old version.  After a hint from a friend I used codewhich curl/code in terminal and apple script editor and get different results:  Terminal says: /opt/local/bin/curl br Apple Script codedo shell script/code says: /usr/bin/curl  So the solution for my problem is to force do shell sript to use the newer version via:  codedo shell script "/opt/local/bin/curl \"https://v.gd/create.php?format=simple&amp;url=http://www.test.de\""/code  <comment298594> How did you update curl? <comment298782> I updated it with homebrew. <comment298785> two things wrong - it is not an optional version it is just another version. Home-brew does not put things in /opt/local - Macports does that. The general issue of using the full path os correct <comment298786> You did not update it you added another curl in a different place and applescript does not have to on its path <comment298834> The `do shell script` command gets passed `"/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"` as the `$PATH` and therefore any commands called that are not within that _path_ need to use the fully qualified pathname in the command. This also applies to commands called in Automator when using Run Shell Script and Run AppleScript actions too.
