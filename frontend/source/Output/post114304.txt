print user's crontab <body> How can I print out my crontab?  Under Linux this can be done using codecrontab -l/code, however, running codecrontab -l/code under Mac OS X produces no output whatsoever and exits cleanly.  Here's my crontab:    precode0 9,10,11,12 * * 1-6 /Users/alexej.magura/scripts/vimmaid.sh 0 9,10,11,12 1,28 1,3,5,7,9,11 * /Users/alexej.magura/scripts/yankmaid.sh 0 9,10,11,12 1,2,*0,*1 * * /Users/alexej.magura/scripts/cronman.sh 0 *1,*3,*5,*7,*9 * * * /Users/alexej.magura/scripts/syl.sh /code/pre  <answer114306> The command for Mac OS X and Linux are the same: codecrontab -l/codebr This seems to indicate that the crontab is empty. Maybe edit the crontab with codecrontab -e/code and afterwards print out the crontab. Your changes should now be printed to console.  <answer114307> OS X doesn't use cron for very much (relying more on launchd) but any crontabs should be located in /usr/lib/cron/tabs/ and /etc/crontab  <answer114311> I copy and pasted my crontab into a file called code~/.crontab/code and ran codecrontab ~/.crontab/code; now when I run codecrontab -l/code, I get:  precode0 9,10,11,12 * * 1-6 /Users/alexej.magura/scripts/vimmaid.sh 0 9,10,11,12 1,28 1,3,5,7,9,11 * /Users/alexej.magura/scripts/yankmaid.sh 0 9,10,11,12 1,2,*0,*1 * * /Users/alexej.magura/scripts/cronman.sh 0 *1,*3,*5,*7,*9 * * * /Users/alexej.magura/scripts/syl.sh /code/pre  <answer178786> This worked for me:  precodecat /Volumes/usr/lib/cron/username /code/pre  <comment133952> Should work the same way on OS X. Do you have any entries in the crontab at all? <comment133955> @patrix added my crontab to the question. <comment133956> running `find /etc/ -name 'cron*'` returns zilch. <comment133958> Are the tasks in your crontab actually being run? <comment133962> So your problem is solved now? <comment133963> @patrix, yup.  :D <comment133965> Your first sentence asked just for that. No?
