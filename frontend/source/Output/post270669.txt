How to fix a delay that occurs when making a web video full-screen on a Mac? <body> When I make any web video (including those on  YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, etc.) full-screen in any web browser (by clicking the full-screen button in the bottom right hand corner of the video), there is always a small delay while the video fills the screen. The delay also exists when I exit out of a full-screen video.  Is there any way to remove this delay?  hr  If I had to guess, I might suspect that the delay results from the full-screen video being shifted to a new, dedicated Space. Since I never use the Spaces feature, I'd disable this feature entirely if that will fix the full-screen video lag.  I don't know how to accomplish this, though. I've already unchecked all of the boxes in the "Mission Control" category of "System Preferences." The multiple desktops feature still exists.  hr  My Macbook Pro is running OS X El Capitan, 10.11.6.  <comment340375> One workaround, for YouTube at least, is the [Magic Actions for YouTube Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magic-actions-for-youtube/abjcfabbhafbcdfjoecdgepllmpfceif?hl=en). Tick "Enable Cinema" in the extension's settings. If you right-click anywhere on the YouTube page, that video will instantly fill the browser screen. Doing the same will instantly return you to the default video size. The full-screen video is slightly smaller than it would be normally, since it does not fill the entire screen (the Dock & top Chrome bar are still shown), but there is no lag.
