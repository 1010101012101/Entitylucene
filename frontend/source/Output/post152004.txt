Folder cannot be deleted from Trash <body> I have three nested folders in my trash: folder1/folder2/folder3. They were on an external FAT32 drive but were deleted, along with all the files inside them, a while ago.  When I try to empty the trash on Yosemite, I get a "file in use" error. I get this even after reboots, with no programs open, and nothing which could be using it.  Navigating to /Volumes/External_name/.Trashes/501/folder1/folder2/folder3 with Terminal gives me a very weird error: I call ls and obtain:  precodeusername-Mac:folder3 username$ ls Filename_with_ö.mp3 username-Mac:folder3 username$ ls -l ls: Filename_with_ö.mp3: No such file or directory /code/pre  I strongly suspect it's something to do with the interaction between OS X, FAT32, and that ö, but I have no idea how to delete a file which doesn't seem to exist... any ideas?  h1Solutions tried/h1  Finder  "Secure Empty Trash" still gives me the "file in use" error. "Disk Utility"  "Repair disk" doesn't fix it either. Also tried:  precodeusername-Mac:folder3 username$ sudo rm -r F* rm: Filename_with_ö.mp3: No such file or directory /code/pre  and  precodeusername-Mac:/ username$ sudo rm -r /Volumes/external_name/.Trashes rm: /Volumes/external_name/.Trashes/501/folder1/folder2/folder3/Filename_with_ö.mp3: No such file or directory rm: /Volumes/external_name/.Trashes/501/folder1/folder2/folder3: Directory not empty rm: /Volumes/external_name/.Trashes/501/folder1/folder2: Directory not empty rm: /Volumes/external_name/.Trashes/501/folder1: Directory not empty rm: /Volumes/external_name/.Trashes/501: Directory not empty rm: /Volumes/external_name/.Trashes: Directory not empty /code/pre  and  precodeusername-Mac:folder3 username$ mv Filename_with_ö.mp3 safe.mp3 mv: rename Filename_with_ö.mp3 to safe.mp3: No such file or directory /code/pre  and  precodeusername-Mac:external_name username$ sudo mv .Trashes /external_trashes mv: .Trashes/501/folder1/folder2/folder3/Filename_with_ö.mp3: No such file or directory mv: /bin/cp: terminated with 1 (non-zero) status /code/pre  Still no success.  <answer152008> Have you tried rm as root:  precodesudo rm -r Filename_with* /code/pre  That command will ask for your administrator password.  <answer152009> I would try deleting the entire .Trashes folder on the external drive:  e.g. codesudo rm -r /Volumes/externaldrive/.Trashes/code  OS X will rebuild the .Trashes after the fact.  —Edit— Just a thought: have you tried replacing the umlauted characters with a file rename? Say codesudo mv /Volumes/externaldrive/.Trashes/501/folder1/folder2/folder3/Filename_with_ö.mp3 /Volumes/externaldrive/.Trashes/501/folder1/folder2/folder3/Filename_without_uml‌​aut.mp3/code  Failing that I’d try to codemv/code the whole .Trashes to your Mac’s HFS+ hard drive.  <answer152410> I have two suggestions. My first is to try creating a folder called .Trashes elsewhere and moving it such that it would overwrite the original folder; it's possible that this would leapfrog the problem (I used a similar method to fix a problem I was having a few months ago).  Alternatively, if the external drive is FAT32, have you tried booting a Linux distro from a USB drive and using that? Alternatively you could plug the external drive into a Windows machine (Boot Camp/VirtualBox?) and see whether that can delete the offending folder.  <answer181366> I had this issue and the only solution that worked for me was to format the external HDD the files were originally on. This emptied the trash along with the bathwater.  <answer186203> Try "trash it", the program claims to remove sticky items from trash http://www.nonamescriptware.com/downloads/  <answer265401> The external volumen has corrupted entries, repairing the Volume usually fixes the issue but the Disk Utility GUI may also fail. Try from the command line:  Close all the applications using the Volume, unmount it, mount it back and run:  precodediskutil verifyVolume /Volumes/external_name diskutil repairvolume /Volumes/external_name /code/pre  That should fix the issue.  <comment178856> It fails silently - `ls` still returns the filename. <comment178857> @DoktorDemento try without the `-f` option to get error messages back <comment178864> @patrix: I get `rm: Filename_with_ö.mp3: No such file or directory`... <comment178866> Trying to delete the whole `.Trashes` just returns `File not found` followed by four successive `Directory not empty`s - I've updated the question. <comment179202> Have you tried renaming the ö file? <comment179338> Renaming gets `No such file or directory`, moving the whole folder gets the same. See the updated question. Thanks for the suggestions... <comment179342> @AllInOne I have now - see update. <comment179467> Do you get a different result if you get the path to the file by dropping it into Terminal? <comment291314> Just had something similar: it looks like MacOS struggles the details of files on FAT media if the filename has non-ASCII characters. The only workaround seems to rename the files on another system. :-(
