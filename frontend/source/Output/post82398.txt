How do I prevent 'Open with...' showing multiples of same app? <body> Anyone know why this happens and how to make it show only one instance of each?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TBe0b.png" alt="Multiple instances"  <answer82400> From the comments, I was able to resolve this using the following command:  code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user/code  <comment95087> That was it guys. Thanks.
