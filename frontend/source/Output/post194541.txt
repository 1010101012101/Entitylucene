Getting a source clip from iMovie <body> Last year I imported a video into iMove, edited it, cut pieces, etc and I have the result as a mov, but I want to also keep the original video file. I can still see it inside iMovie, but how do I get ahold of that file as a single simple file system file?  <answer194552> The iMovie Library file is actually a folderâ€¦br Right click it &amp; 'Show Package Contents'  Then the original file is inside [movie name]  Original Media   You can drag a copy out to any other location. Keep the original in place, or iMovie will lose it.
