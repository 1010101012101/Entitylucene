What filesystems can Snow Leopard read? <body> I just got a Macbook Pro for my parents, and I need to get their files from a Linux desktop machine that most likely has either reiserfs or ext3 file systems.  I would like to know if Snow Leopard can read these files if I put the HDD in an external HDD case??  Thanks  <answer7974> It might be easier to connect the machines on a network and use rsync, nfs or ftp   to copy data, no extra software would be needed.  If you want to do this you will need MacFuse which allows OSX to read other file systems. A tutorial for ext3 is on this blog.  <answer7977> If you are planning on doing this a lot, there are commecial packages too:   http://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-mac/  There is a free alternatives also though through MacFuse/FUSE:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse-ext2/files/  <answer7978> Disk Utility can format a new hard drive using the following formats:   ul liMac OS X format/li liMac OS X format (Journaled)/li liFAT32 (MS-DOS)/li liFAT64, also known as exFAT/li /ul  I believe those would be the same file systems that the operating system can read.   <answer7981> Mac OS X can read (but not necessarily write):  ul liHFS+ (Mac OS X default format, in plain, journaled, case-sensitive, or journaled/case-sensitive varieties)/li liNTFS (but not write, by default)/li liFAT (32 and 64 as seen in Christian Correa's comment)/li /ul  I would expect it can read but I haven't tested it:  ul liHFS (the older Mac OS file system [Hierarchical File System])/li liUFS (Unix File System; older versions of OS X could format and be installed on UFS partitions)/li /ul  I know for a fact that OS X will not read:  ul liReiserFS/li liext* (any of the various versions of the ext Linux file system)/li lijust about anything else/li /ul  Check out the Mac OS X column at the incredibly complete Wikipedia article comparing file systems.  <comment8607> OS X definitely can't read FreeBSD UFS file systems. <comment8619> The question text does not match the question title. <comment8633> Thanks.  I'll try the network option this coming weekend.
