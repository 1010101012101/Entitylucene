iOS 7 calendar on iPhone 5 not syncing with MS Exchange properly <body> Here is our environment:    ul liServer: MS Exchange 2010/li liMS Outlook 2010/li liiPhone 5 running iOS 7/li /ul  Since the upgrade to iOS 7, all calendar events created before the update do not update on the iPhone if they are altered in MS Outlook. If I create a new event in MS Outlook or on the phone the two sync perfectly.  Any help would be appreciated!
