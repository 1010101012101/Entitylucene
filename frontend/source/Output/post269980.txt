Google Chrome: how to change smart zoom behaviour on magic trackpad/magic mouse? <body> Why Google Chrome responds to the Smart Zoom gesture in a different way than Safari?  When zooming in an article or a picture in Safari, the Smart Zoom puts some space or bezel around the chosen content.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/feE1M.png" alt="Safari behaviour on a random article"  Doing the same in Chrome leads to extreme zoom, resulting in no bezel around text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DWbM3.png" alt="Chrome behaviour on a random article"  This leads to resize with pinch gesture to be readable.  Is there a way to change the behaviour making Chrome match Safari's?  I've already tried changing the behaviour of Blink rendering engine into codechrome://flags/code but this is not affecting zooming behaviour!
