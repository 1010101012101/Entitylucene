Safari 7.1 Bookmark not closing properly <body> I sometime notice this random behaviour of the bookmarks not closing and it leaves me with something like this, any suggestions?  I'm running Mavericks with everything updated.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w1Mb9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer162637> Added as answer just to provide image…  I think you might be surprised how much memory Safari can use if you view all its processes Hierarchically… a rough tot-up here gives me about 2.7 GB ...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3V8Pc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment190093> is the extreme 'squariness' the symptom, or anonymising for the picture? <comment190114> @Tetsujin it's anonymising =) the problem is the grey area that keeps showing until you open and close the bookmarks again. <comment190115> OK, thanks, just checking. Does it do it immediately after a reboot? Have you tried with very few tabs open? [I know how many tabs you can build up over a time… & they really hit memory] My thought is it could be struggling for memory, paging to disk etc. <comment190126> To be honest it's not slow and safari uses max 500 mb memory. I think it happens more at random. <comment190219> When it occurred this was in activity monitor - https://www.evernote.com/shard/s314/sh/039a9979-a879-498f-8c12-6327fd67aff6/cf988e31b6e5dbb27250d299739db7af
