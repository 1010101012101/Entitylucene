GitSupport.sh permanently running, apparently hangs <body> I have a niggling process that sometimes runs persistently, somewhat randomly, and sometimes cannot be cancelled. In the screenshot, there are three processes of the same running simultaneously. I'm wondering if anyone has seen this before. I'm not able to locate the process in the command line. I have Git installed for local web development, so it obviously relates to that, but I'm wondering what it's searching for, and why it hangs, and what I can do to make the process work and quit, instead of sometimes running perpetually.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LRSJ5.png" alt="Screenshot of GitSupport.sh process"  <answer230399> I had the same problem, in my case it was caused by the Right Click Booster app.  com.HobbyistSoftware.RightClick.RCPlugin/GitSupport.sh  <comment244242> git does not have GitSupport.sh as default - Seaech your disk and find where it is and read it. Also look in you LaunchAgens to see where it is launched <comment281219> Awesome! Can you elaborate on why (if you know?)
