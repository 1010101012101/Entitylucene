How do I increase the font size in Activity Monitor? <body> I've tried codecmd+/code and codecmd-/code, and I've looked through all the menus.  I'm aware of "accessibility zoom" and it is not an answer to my question.  <answer259845> Activity Monitor does not provide any method of adjusting the font size.br You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul  <comment325149> I do not believe you can change the font size in Activity Monitor and using Accessibility Zoom is your only (non) answer! ;) <comment325368> Feedback sent to apple <comment325477> OS X is terrible choice if you want to have even remotely customizable UI or even basic "accessibility" features. Sad fact of lifeâ€¦ But most apple tech can work with some variants of GNU/Linux, so all is not lost.
