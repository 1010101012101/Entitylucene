Is my macbook pro dying? <body> I have a Macbook pro 4,1 early 2008.  It's a great machine for surfing while the TV is on, but it's starting to act strange.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8BQT1.png" alt="Sameple shot 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QPWEP.png" alt="enter image description here"  These screenshots are both of a google sheet -- same one a few minutes apart.  I can see two possibilities:  A:  My GPU is dying, and doesn't work in certain modes.  B:  I've got a bad memory stick.  How do I diagnose which?  <answer274804> Run Apple Apple Hardware Test.  Apple Hardware Test (AHT) contains a suite of diagnostics that test the hardware of your Mac.  Here is the official support article by Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257  And the relevant instructions, "Turn on your Mac, then immediately press and hold the D key on your keyboard. Keep holding the D key until you see the Apple Hardware Test icon."  <comment345594> Are these pictures or screenshots? If they're pictures, next time you encounter the problem, try taking a screenshot. <comment345663> They are screenshots.  Why? <comment345679> Because a bad display would capture a clean picture whereas a bad GPU would capture the distorted picture.   Your GPU is probably toast. <comment345910> The problem with the hardware test is that the problem vanishes -- for a while -- on reboot. <comment346005> Can you elaborate? Because hardware test won't just test for hardware problems that happen at reboot, but test the hardware in general against some checks and give you a report. Did you try the hardware test though? Did test report anything?
