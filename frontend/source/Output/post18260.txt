If I set an alarm clock with a ringtone, how long will the ringtone run if I do not stop it? <body> If I set the iphone alarm clock with a ringtone, how long will the ringtone run if I do not stop it?  Will it run all the way until it runs out of battery and the phone shuts down?  <answer18261> Indefinitely, near as I can tell. I once had my phone go for over a half hour on an alarm.  <answer44739> I just tested this with iPhone 3GS iOS 5.1 and the alarm stopped after exactly 15 minutes.  <comment19945> a half hour and indefinitely is **totally different**. <comment19949> Since the ringtone almost certainly isn't 20+ minutes, it's obviously looping the tone. No setting users can control last longer than 5 minutes, so I'd call 30m ~ indefinitely. It would be theoretically interesting to see if either of the low voltage alerts pause the audio, but I'll leave that for another day ;-) <comment19952> @bmike is right. Since the phone is looping the same sound, 30 minutes might as well be indefinitely. There is a reason why I qualified my answer with "near as I can tell." <comment288793> Any chance someone can test, confirm, and update the answer with the latest version of iOS? <comment288796> testing... this could get annoying ;-) <comment288798> Alarm stopped at 15 mins, on iPhone 6S, iOS 9.3.1 - however, the screen has dimmed but will not sleep with the alert still showing <comment288803> hmm... it's actually 16 minutes. Tested again, as I wasn't certain to the absolute minute first time. Also, if the screen was off to start with, it stays off.
