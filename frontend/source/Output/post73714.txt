Assign all desktops? <body> I'm trying some of the tips from the Cult of Mac iTunes 11 tips blog post. I don't see emOptions  Assign To  All Desktops/em when I right click my iTunes 11 icon. Any ideas? Using OSX 10.8.2, that matters.     Hereâ€™s a nifty tip for using iTunes 11 in multiple Spaces or monitors: right click the iTunes icon in your dock and select Options  Assign To  All Desktops. Now when you use iTunes in full screen mode, you can also open the MiniPlayer separately and have it run in a different space or monitor. So you could have iTunes running full screen on your big external monitor while the MiniPlayer is on your laptop screen.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxPyv.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer73721> Killing dock a couple times seemed to fix the problem:  precodekillall Dock /code/pre  In case Dock doesn't get restarted automatically run  precodesudo launchctl load System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Dock.plist sudo launchctl start com.apple.Dock.agent /code/pre  <comment85634> On my Lion machine, I still have that option, but there are definitely some bugs in iTunes 11, so perhaps it doesn't show up for some configurations. <comment85637> I'm on ML and don't see the option either <comment85644> for me it is working under ML - do you have spaces activated? <comment85645> Yes, thought of that first. <comment85647> Yep, same here.
