How to disable the warning when saving names that begin with a dot? <body> I get a warning when I try to save a dotfile. The warning message is:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZTMW.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IKhBR.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I disable this?  <answer221303> You can't easily disable that on OS X. You can easily set up a folder action to rename files you save once they hit the filesystem. It's clunky, but better than renaming things by hand.  <comment140651> http://imgur.com/YDFzpoW <comment140659> afaik you can't. manually rename them with `$mv paco.rtf .paco.rtf`(in a terminal) <comment267971> Just pressing Enter on that dialog is less hassle and requires no renaming than a folder action which requires you to move the dotfile after its creation? <comment267988> @grgarside Yes - but it doesn't disable the warning. It's a bad workaround - but if you do this dozens of times a day, automating a workaround is still viable. Hard to tell - I'm guessing the OP was hoping for a quick patch.
