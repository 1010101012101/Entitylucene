Dim screen brightness of MBP, using AppleScript (and while using a secondary monitor)? <body> I just got a secondary monitor to use with my MacBook Pro (13" Retina Early-2015). I previously had AppleScripts for dimming and for increasing the brightness of the MBP screen—either to no bars or to about 75%—but now they aren't working for some reason (w/ or w/o the external monitor plugged in). I also tried using Shades but both screens keep flashing every 2-3 seconds (I'd rather use an AppleScript as well).  Basically, my external monitor is my main screen and I want to be able to dim my MBP screen using an AppleScript to either no bars or about 75% (of which the scripts will then be redirected to keyboard shortcuts with an application).  What AppleScript code would be needed to do this?  EDIT:  Here is the old that worked really well before, but for some reason stopped (with out without an external monitor plugged in).  codetell application "System Events"     repeat 16 times         key code 107     end repeat end tell/code  and  codetell application "System Events"     repeat 11 times         key code 113     end repeat end tell/code  <answer272572> This script will set the value of my display brightness to 75% on my MacBook Pro running OS Sierra if I only have just my retina display available in my display preferences  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qopGd.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  precodetell application "System Preferences"     if it is running then         quit     end if end tell delay 0.2 activate application "System Preferences" tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         click button "Displays" of scroll area 1 of window "System Preferences"         delay 1         set value of value indicator 1 of slider 1 of group 2 of tab group 1 of window "Built-in Retina Display" to 0.75     end tell     delay 1     quit application "System Preferences" end tell /code/pre  hr  This script will set the value of my display brightness to 75% on my MacBook Pro running OS Sierra if I have retina display available and I have airplay enabled and using my airplay device as a second monitor in display preferences  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BIzdF.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodetell application "System Preferences"     if it is running then         quit     end if end tell delay 0.2 activate application "System Preferences" tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         click button "Displays" of scroll area 1 of window "System Preferences"         delay 1         click radio button "Display" of tab group 1 of window "Built-in Retina Display"         set value of value indicator 1 of slider 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of window "Built-in Retina Display" to 0.75     end tell     delay 1     quit application "System Preferences" end tell /code/pre  For both of these scripts though, my built in retina display is my main monitor.  Here is a revised version of the script which will set the brightness to 75% without bringing system preferences application to the front. I think you will find this to be more efficient.  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences" to tell window "Built-in Retina Display"     set value of value indicator 1 of slider 1 of group 2 of tab group 1 to 0.75 end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  <answer285907> Having a secondary monitor was not the issue, it was that I also needed an external keyboard.  When using an external keyboard, the brightness key codes change from code107/code and code113/code to code145/code and code144/code respectively, to lower/raise the brightness level.  For anyone interested, the correct codekey code/code events that works with an external keyboard (tested/works with an external Apple keyboard) are:  To lower the brightness all the way use:  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat 16 times         key code 145     end repeat end tell /code/pre  The above code will lower the brightness all the way, regardless of where it's currently set. If it's already set at anything below 100%, any extra lower codekey code/code events, while still executed, are done so harmlessly and are just ignored when the above code runs.  To raise the brightness to, e.g. 75%, use:  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat 12 times         key code 144     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Note that if you want a smother transition, add a codedelay 0.02/code emcommand/em to each coderepeat/code emloop/em, otherwise the transition can appear quite abrupt.  <comment342548> Since you already have some AppleScript code that at one time did what you wanted, why not debug the code to make it work again? That said, since you do have code that at one time work and apparently doesn't now, why not include the code in your question and the changes in conditions that caused it to no longer work. We might be able to debug it. Did you upgrade to a different major version of OS X or from OS X to mac OS, etc.? <comment342568> I actually just tested the second script with my retina built-in display arranged as my main monitor and again with my airplay display arranged as my main monitor and the script worked both times. <comment342610> The 1st code doesn't work and gives me an error. The 2nd code works, but has to launch System Preferences every time. <comment342611> Added the old code to the post. <comment342612> I found out what was causing the AppleScript to stop working. Since I got an external monitor, I also had to get a seperate Apple keyboard. When the keyboard is plugged in, the script doesn't work (works when it isn't). <comment358613> @samseva I added a version of the script which will not bring system preferences to the front <comment360703> FWIW I use my MacBooK Pro with a Thunderbolt Display, mostly in Clamshell Mode and with an external keyboard, however in either scenario, the MBP's Display opened/closed, if the external keyboard is not attached then `107`/`113` to lower/raise the brightness works. It's only with the external keyboard attached that I have to use `145` and `144` to lower/raise the brightness. By the way, this only changes the brightness on the external display in any configuration on my system. <comment360708> @user349894 You changed 75% of my answer, you corrected already correct sentences and added 534 characters to explain obvious things/simple code. You should spend your time more wisely/on other things. :)
