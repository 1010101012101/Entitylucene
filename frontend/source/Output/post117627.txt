Is there any way to enable microsoft silverlight in IOS? <body> Some websites need Microsoft silverlight for streaming. Is it possible  or is there any way to enable Microsoft Silverlight on IOS devices?  <answer117631> No. Silverlight is not supported on iOS devices.  <answer191922> There is a back to front way. Use the horizon app to log into vmware server to load a version of windows running ie with silver light. Not fast but it works in a pinch.
