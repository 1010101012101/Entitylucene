How do I get storedownloadd to stop? <body> Judging by the codeRcvd Bytes/code column in Activity Monitor, storedownloadd has been busy downloading. It downloaded 2GBytes while my computer was on today, and earlier this evening it downloaded 424.1MBytes.  I'm assuming this is macOS Sierra, but that's not terribly important - I just want it to stop! What options do I have to set to do this?  I've played with the App Store settings a bit:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6T0tD.png" alt="enter image description here"  But this didn't seem to make any difference. I've rebooted, and softwaredownloadd is still downloading. 320MBytes now. Wait... how big emis/em this thing?  (I'm reluctant to disable the automatic update check. I like to know when new updates are available. However I do insist on being allowed to schedule the download and installation myself.)

I'd say it's a bug. Btw, you can locate the download by running `lsof -p PID`, where PID is from Activity Monitor (or use Activity Mon's "open files and ports"). The `.pkg` is the one. After unchecking the pref, you can `launchctl stop com.apple.storedownloadd` and then `launchctl start com.apple.storedownloadd`. Remove the pkg if you want.
