Best way to split large media files for sharing <body> I have a large code.mkv/code file that I am looking to share with a friend. My Dropbox limit is 2GB so I am looking for a simple way to split the file in to chunks of say 1gb, send them individually and the have him recompile it on his end.  <answer200101> What I'd do is just split the video in half using iMovie or Final Cut Pro X, then export the project and then send it. Just have your recipient put both halves back together again using iMovie or FCPX.  <answer200102> Rather than going to the effort of splitting it then re-combining at the other end...  There are dozens of file-sending sites - I mean direct user-to-user not em'dodgy stuff off the interwebz'/em. I've used https://www.wetransfer.com before now, but Google has a whole lot more options under 'send large files free'  <answer200109> I don't think you should go through the hassle of splitting your file.
