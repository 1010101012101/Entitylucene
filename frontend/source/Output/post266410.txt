What does it mean Band or Non-band in an iPhone specs? <body> NB30 stands for Non band 30, what is this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kQ2xU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer266417> The iPhone 6S exists in basically two versions:  Models A1687 and A1688 has support for LTE bands 1-5, 7-8, 12-13, 17-20 and 25-29  Models A1633 and A1634 has support for LTE bands 1-5, 7-8, 12-13, 17-20 and 26-30.  The extra band 30 is a special AT&amp;T band. The iPhone supporting that band were sold by certain dealers in the US.  The NB30 on your iPhone description just means that you iPhone does not support LTE band 30.  <comment334042> Please don't repost your questions!
