Bluetooth Audio with Bootcamp on Macbook Pro <body> I have the late 2013 model Macbook Pro retina, and a Bose Sound Link speaker (bluetooth speaker).  I am using Bootcamp with Windows 7 Pro.  I'd like to be able to connect to my Bose speaker from the Macbook via Bluetooth, and play audio from it. But the problem is, every time it will say something such as 'driver not found' and then ask me to download a new driver. I've searched quite some time, following several guides online, but none of them seem to work.  How would I do this?  <answer117922> It would appear that you need to update the Broadcomm Bluetooth drivers using codeWIDCOMM Bluetooth Software/code to get the speakers working under Windows 7.  You can get the driver from this page :-   http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php  You might also want to try updating the firmware in your speakers. You can grab an application to do that on this page :-  http://worldwide.bose.com/downloads/en/web/bose_bluetooth_speaker_download/page.html  <answer121061> I had a similar problem and found the solution in the following link:  https://discussions.apple.com/message/17665845#17665845  Try option 3.  I hope this helps,  MAP.  <answer167331> On my MacBook Pro 17” with Windows 7 32bit – I had only to download the: Updated Bluetooth® for Windows® software at  http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php this small software will do all to you, find, download and install like a miracle.  On my MacBook Pro 13” with Windows 7 64bit wasn’t that easy. Just download the above driver from the apple forum:  http://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Driver/Bluetooth/Bluetooth_Atheros_7.4.0.96_W7x64_A.zip?acerid=634556349384706773&amp;Step1=NOTEBOOK&amp;Step2=ASPIRE&amp;Step3=ASPIRE%204830TG&amp;OS=ALL&amp;LC=en&amp;BC=ACER&amp;SC=AAP_10#_ga=1.168624617.97054721.1418479225Bluetooth_Atheros_7.4.0.96_W7x64_A.zip  After unzipping I only had to run the codeBluetooth_Suite_win7.EXE/code file, reboot the computer and my SoundLink Mini was installed correctly!  <comment137806> I tried the driver and got this message - http://puu.sh/6sB58/19ae47bf6e.jpg I'm sure the bluetooth module works. <comment137807> So it wouldn't let you download the drivers? <comment137808> Well I went to the broadcom URL you provided, and downloaded it. But when I ran it, I got the message saying that it couldn't find my bluetooth chip. <comment137812> Dang. You need to get those drivers somehow. Drop an email to support at Broadcomm maybe. Did you build the Boot Camp driver pack on that computer? Does any other BlueTooth stuff work? <comment137813> It works just fine for things such as tethering. Apple provided a package of drivers which I've already installed. None of them include the one for bluetooth audio as far as I know though. <comment323344> The Atheros driver also worked for a mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina 15".
