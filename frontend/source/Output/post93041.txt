terminal search files by text that the file names contain <body> Let's say there a file called "abc_deh.xyz", what command do i use to find the location of that file in mac terminal by using solely the search term "deh"? So, basically, I am asking how to search for a file by text contained in its name. I need to find files that I forgot the whole name, that would be more helpful.  <answer93044> precodesudo find / -type f -name "*deh*" /code/pre  if you want to search directories too then remove the -type f.  You can also try:     sudo locate emdeh/em  Should your locate database not be created (or up to date), there is a chance you have that file on the filesystem, but it's not been stored yet. Rather than run a single find command above, building the locate.db database might be a better plan going forward.  <answer93046> The codemdfind/code command can be used to find all indexed files that contain a specific string in the filename.  In your case:  precode mdfind -name deh /code/pre  <answer93083> I use codeglob-complete-word/code a lot:  precodeopen */*deh # press \eg to complete paths /code/pre  Also add codeset show-all-if-ambiguous on/code to code~/.inputrc/code if you haven't already. If there are multiple completions, it makes the first press of code\eg/code show all of them. If it's not enabled and there are multiple paths that match code*/*deh/code, the code*deh/code part is deleted.  If you use bash 4, codeshopt -s globstar/code makes code**/code match multiple levels of directories.  If you use mdfind or find and there is a single line of output, you can use a key binding like this to insert it:  precode"\eo": "$(!!)\e\C-e" /code/pre
