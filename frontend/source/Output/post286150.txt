Wifi stops working after using airplay for some time <body> I'm working from home from my macbook 12" and to have some more space on the screen I have an additional display at work which I connect via HDMI-to-USB-C converter, but at home I have Apple TV connected to my TV reachable over Wifi. After 40 minutes of working I noticed that my laptop has no connection to the Internet and Wifi is grayed out (disconnected). I checked my router but it was blinking as crazy. I disconnected from Airplay and Wifi started working perfectly. After reconnecting to Apple TV it worked fine for an extra 10 minutes and Wifi disappeared again. What can be the issue?  <comment360973> I'd assume it's your wireless router. They're typically very hit or miss, and picking a good one is almost an art. What make and model do you have? <comment361072> I have a bunch of them actually, but the one I'm testing is Xiaomi WiFi Router 3. <comment361114> Assuming I'm looking at the same router which costs $30, I'd say that that's most likely the culprit. Routers that cheap are often problematic. <comment361208> Interesting point, however it worked like a charm before I updated macOS. <comment361210> It's a combination of multiple factors. Many wireless routers are known to have their quirks. If they all completely adhered to the standards, things would be much easier, but with each OS update, given that they can't test every single router available, there's always a chance of some modification they make in the OS, not working well with some random manufacturer's less-than-standards-compliant implementation. It's a well-known ongoing problem. The reality is that wireless is hard. It's not entirely either Apple or the router manufacturers' faults. A little of both, possibly neither. :) <comment361247> Having a call with Apple support tomorrow morning, will update after that.
