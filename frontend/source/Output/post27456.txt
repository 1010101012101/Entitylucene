Merge e-mail addresses on iCloud <body> I have made a mistake. I'm a developer and while testing iCloud I made an @me.com (let's call it dummy@me.com) account. Now I am setting up iCloud on all my devies and would like to use my original Apple ID which I use my Gmail for. To use Notes and Mail in iCloud I need a @me.com mail and I would like to use the one I made earlier (dummy@me.com) but I am told this e-mail is already registered - that's true, it's mine. My original Apple ID has another @me.com e-mail attached to it (let's call it placeholder@me.com).  Does anyone know if there is a way to delete dummy@me.com and recreate it on my original Apple ID or attach it to my original Apple ID?  <answer27459> Despite some positive reports in September, it looks like you won't be able to merge Apple IDs. You can, however, set up iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Mac or PC to use two different accounts for iCloud and purchases:     h3iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:/h3      When you first set up your iOS 5 device, enter the Apple ID you want   to use with iCloud. If you skipped the setup assistant, sign in to   strongSettings  iCloud/strong and enter the Apple ID you’d like to use with   iCloud. In strongSettings  Store/strong, sign in with the Apple ID you want to use   for store purchases (including iTunes in the Cloud and iTunes Match).   You may need to sign out first to change the Apple ID.      h3Mac:/h3      Enter the Apple ID you want to use for iCloud in strongApple () menu    System Preferences  iCloud/strong.  Enter the Apple ID you want to use for   store purchases (including iTunes in the Cloud and iTunes Match) in   strongiTunes  iTunes Store/strong.      h3PC:/h3      Enter the Apple ID you want to use for iCloud in strongControl Panel    Network  Internet  iCloud/strong.  Enter the Apple ID you want to use for   store purchases (including iTunes in the Cloud and iTunes Match) in   strongiTunes  iTunes Store/strong.           Note: You can switch the Apple ID you use for     store purchases at any time. However, you can only change the account     you use for any iTunes in the Cloud features once every 90 days. See     this article for more information.      <comment31583> The Apple ID/iCloud management tools are so lacking it's ridiculous. Don't expect to be able to do anything deemed "complicated".
