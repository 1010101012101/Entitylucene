Selecting correct offline update file for iPad 2 <body> I can't download from the update of my iPad 2 through iTunes. My internet connection is unstable. iTunes is giving me a hard time.  So, I googled around a bit and stumbled on this website, iClarified which allows me to download the strong*.ipsw/strong files, with resume capability. Ok, found it.   emPlease let make some noise if I shouldn't download form this website./em  Now, the issue is there are several updates for my iPad2.For the latest 5.1, I have 4 updates files to choose from,  ol li5.1.0 (iPad 2 Wi-Fi): iPad2,1_5.1_9B176_Restore.ipsw/li li5.1.0 (iPad 2 GSM): iPad2,2_5.1_9B176_Restore.ipsw/li li5.1.0 (iPad 2 CDMA): iPad2,3_5.1_9B176_Restore.ipsw/li li5.1.0 (iPad 2 Unknown): iPad2,4_5.1_9B176_Restore.ipsw/li /ol  Now, I am not sure, which one is for me.   My iPad is with Wifi and I am under GSM network. So, with this, either emupdate #1/em or emupdate #2/em is for me. As every iPad comes with wifi, so I am assuming the update #2 is correct for my phone.  Is all my deduction correct? I really want to think twice before messing with it.  <answer50325> iClarified just links to IPSW files hosted by Apple (note the apple.com URLs), so it's a reasonable place to find links to download these files.  Yes, #2 sounds like the correct choice for you. (Note that if you choose the wrong IPSW, iTunes will just give you an error message and not restore the device to it. And even if you could theoretically restore to the wrong IPSW, you can always start over and restore it again.)  <answer164926> Based on the model number of your iPad, you will be able to identify which iOS firmware file you need to download.  You can find model number on the iPad’s back cover as highlighted below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQqM4.jpg" alt="iPad Model Info"  Refer to the table below to identify which iOS firmware file to download based on your iPad’s model number.

Latest iPad iOS Offline Updates  Reference: iPhonehacks  <comment57699> Thank you. Can you tell me what's the *Unknown* update for? <comment57701> The iPhone Wiki says [it's the second revision of the iPad 2 Wi-Fi model](http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Firmware#Wi-Fi_model_.28R2.29), which ["makes use of a revised CPU (A5 chip)"](http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=K93aap). It's an unofficial wiki, but they usually know what they're talking about. Here's [an article found via Google](http://www.anandtech.com/show/5742/apples-ipad-24-also-uses-32nm-a5-s5l8942-soc) that has more details about it. <comment57703> I brought mine a few months back, so should I go for the unknown one? How to know which version is my iPad? <comment57704> It sounds like this second revision iPad 2 is just a Wi-Fi model, not a GSM + Wi-Fi model, so it isn't yours. <comment57705> Sorry, I don't understand. <comment57706> You have a GSM + Wi-Fi iPad 2 (according to your original question), and there is only one version of those, so IPSW #2 is the correct IPSW for you.  If you had an iPad 2 with Wi-Fi but no GSM or CDMA connectivity, you'd have to download both IPSW #1 and IPSW #4 since we wouldn't know whether you had a 1st revision or 2nd revision iPad 2 Wi-Fi. <comment57708> Yeh, that's what I asked, how to know which revision of my iPad is? Is there any software to know this? <comment57911> According to [this Engadget post](http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/04/rare-ipad-2-variant-32nm-processor/), you can use the desktop application [Geekbench](http://www.primatelabs.ca/geekbench/) to detect this kind of information.
