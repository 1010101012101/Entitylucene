Firewall: Add command-line tool to rules (mosh-server) <body> How can I add a command line tool I've installed manually to the system firewall? The tool is Mobile Shell (mosh) installed via the excellent Homebrew)?  Specifically, I want to add a rule for code/usr/local/bin/mosh-server/code that allows incoming UDP traffic on 60001-60999.  I've tried using System Preference's Firewall pane and the "+" button, but I cannot seem to browse to code/usr/code. I've configured Finder to display hidden and system files using TinkerTool, but that seemingly has no affect on the selection dialogue, which still hides code/usr/code.  I've read a bit about using codeipfw/code, but that's no longer available in Yosemite (v10.10). codepfctl/code seems to be the replacement. I'll use these if I have to, but I'd much rather add an entry to the system firewall UI, so the change is discoverable.  <answer151698> I knew I was being dumb: in the Finder dialog that pops up, press Shift+âŒ˜+G and enter code/usr/code. From there I can browse to the binary.  Turns out this is a completely ordinary Finder shortcut for "Go to folder".
