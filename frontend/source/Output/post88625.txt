How do I install one extension for all Firefox profiles? <body> I run many firefox profiles simultaneously. Since moving to the mac, I've lost the British English dictionary. I can install it as an extension on each profile, but I'd like to install it once across all profiles.  I've tried codefirefox -install-global-extension "/path/to/extension.xpi"/code but that appears to have no effect whatsoever. I've tried copying the installed extension into various folders in code/Library/code and code~/Library/code but nothing has worked.  How do I install a Firefox extension once so it is active for all profiles on the computer (or this user account, either is good)?  <answer91151> You need to put the global extensions (code.xpi/code files) into the code/Applications/Firefox.app/MacOS/extensions/code folder (when you select Firefox.app, right-click and "Show package contents").  If Firefox doesn't recognize the xpi, try to install it for your profile, then move it from code~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/&lt;profile&gt;.default/extensions/code to the path mentioned above.  <comment107156> I guess this will work, but I think every upgrade to Firefox will overwrite the extensions. Is there an alternative that survives upgrades? <comment107186> I think that Firefox in-application upgrades are incremental, so there is a chance that not all files in the application folder will be overwritten. I haven't tried this, though.
