What is Apple doing with UUCP? <body> I have been looking into UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy, a very old network protocol) as a way of communicating with some Linux boxes that don't always have an internet connection. While doing so on my Macbook (with El Capitan), I found entries in my code/usr/share/uucp/sys/code file for codeuucpsys1.apple.com/code and codeuucpsys2.apple.com/code. (You can also see these by running codeuuchk | less/code.)  What is Apple doing with UUCP? I found this post on the Apple forums by someone who noticed a UUCP user, but no one came forward with an explanation, so I'm hoping someone here will know.  I'm especially curious because code/usr/share/*/code falls under System Integrity Protection in El Capitan, which means I'll need to set up a separate UUCP implementation if I want to use it for my purposes — but it also suggests that, if Apple's shipping OS X with a UUCP that only they can use, they must be using it for emsomething./em   emETA:/em I've also found a launchd daemon at code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.uucp.plist/code. It has code&lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;&lt;true/&gt;/code in the plist, so it won't be run by default, but other daemons could enable it programmatically without altering the plist. I'm also intrigued to see that it's in code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons//code (and thus subject to SIP) rather than code/Library/LaunchDaemons//code — it adds to my hunch that it's something Apple is using (or maybe was using, as patrix comments), rather than just a miscellaneous *nix tool they happened to include.  <answer226276> Those entries are examples that can be used as templates in user defined configurations.   See the same examples at:  precodehttp://www.opensource.apple.com/source/uucp/uucp-11/configs/sys /code/pre  You can see those examples in the same way as the phone prefix +555 in the movies. It there to show somebody using a phone, but the fake number/name cant be called. Placing an example with a ficticious hostname allows to have a template.   <comment274612> Apple is probably doing nothing with UUCP so they didn't even realize that SIP prevents anybody from using it. <comment274626> Aside: if anyone else is trying to use UUCP on OS X, I figured out that you don't actually need to install an entirely separate implementation: all of the commands let you specify a different configuration file with `--config /usr/local/conf/uucp/config`, so you just need to create your own define log, spool, etc with that. `info uucp` was a big help. <comment274748> Neither uucpsys1.apple.com nor uucpsys2.apple.com get resolved in DNS, so whatever it was, it's long gone (or only used internally by Apple).
