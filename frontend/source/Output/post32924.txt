Building mPlayer from Source - Error <body> Trying to build mplayer from source for applying patches.   code./configure/code works fine, but it leads me to this error  precode    Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:   "_fribidi_reorder_line", referenced from:       _ass_shaper_reorder in ass_shaper.o   "_fribidi_get_bidi_types", referenced from:       _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o   "_fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels", referenced from:       _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o   "_fribidi_get_joining_types", referenced from:       _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o   "_fribidi_join_arabic", referenced from:       _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o   "_fribidi_shape", referenced from:       _ass_shaper_shape in ass_shaper.o ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 collect2: ld returned 1 exit status make: *** [mplayer] Error 1 /code/pre  I can't figure out what to do now? I'm using OS X 10.7.  <answer33632> What about using Homebrew?  Once installed it should be as easy as writing in the terminal  precodebrew install mplayer /code/pre  <answer40190> Is it necessary for you to compile from source? If not, still to this day (e.g. under Lion) I've continued to have luck installing MPlayer OSX Extended, and mplayer's own binary codecs package.  After installing codeMPlayer OSX Extended/code, I usually symlink mplayer into either code~/Applications/code on my own computer, or code/usr/local/bin/code on one with multiple users, update my code$PATH/code as necessary, and have the pleasure of having an easily invocable codemplayer/code binary for use with anything.  The raw mplayer binary is located at code/Applications/MPlayer OSX Extended.app/Contents/Resources/Binaries/mpextended.mpBinaries/Contents/mpextended.mpBinaries/Contents/MacOS/mplayer/code  I usually enter the codeApplications/code folder inside my home directory and then run codeln -s /Applications/MPlayer\ OSX\ Extended.app/Contents/Resources/Binaries/mpextended.mpBinaries/Contents/mpextended.mpBinaries/Contents/MacOS/mplayer/code.  All done!  <comment37642> This is a programming related question.
