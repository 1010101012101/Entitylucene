Added site certificate to X509Anchors keychain and STILL can't view page <body> I added the certificate to the X509Anchors keychain and I STILL can't view FedEx tracking page. It starts to load and then gets cancelled.   <comment106954> Why do you need the keychain to access FedEx. What browser are you using? you could have the browser remember the log in stuff. As of Mac OS® X 10.5 Leopard®, the X509Anchors keychain is obsolete. <comment106991> i have OSX 10.4. Wanted to track a package. I can view the main FedEx page but not the page tracking my package. I didn't know how else to get my computer to allow the tracking page to show so I tried adding the certificate to my key chain. Maybe I just need to upgrade to OSX 10.5...
