Older MacBook Pro reboots after waking up from sleep mode <body> I have an older MacBook Pro that I haven't used frequently for some time.  Now I notice the following irritating behavior:  ul liWhen I close the lid, I can see and hear the system going to sleep mode - that is, suspending to disk./li liWhen I reopen the lid and press the power button (after the system has turned itself off, of course), I get the expected gray screen with the progress bar that tells me the system is restoring its memory contents from the sleep image./li liThe system then performs a complete reboot, as if someone had pressed a reset switch, which is obviously not what I want./li /ul  I don't have a clue on how to diagnose this issue - I have found a lots of sites dealing with all kinds of sleep problems, but so far none with these exact symptoms, and I'd like to avoid resetting and overwriting stuff without knowing what I'm doing and what I might be damaging in the process.  <comment144814> I have same issue after upgrading to 10.9.2. Worked fine before. Now every time screen goes to sleep (do not have HD set to sleep), and you wake it, it reboots! Booted to Safe Mode (hold down shift on bootup) and it works fine. So, it is software, just do not know what software is causing this! Have reset Energy Saver back to defaults and reset the NVRAM and repairing permissions don't fix the problem.
