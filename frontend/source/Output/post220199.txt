User with read-only permission can still write <body> I have a share that has the permissions:  ul liUser "K" - read/write/li liGroup "Home" - read only./li /ul  However, when a user other than K, member of group Home connects to this share she can still create files on it.  The unix permissions on this share are: rwxr-x--- for K and Home resp. When C creates a directory or file they get created with rw------- with C and Home. I assume that the SMB daemon runs as root, and thus can create files, and somehow ignores the unix permissions.   Permissions for the shared directory (executing codels -del /Volumes/SharedVolume/code) are:  precoderwxrwxr-x+ 8 K  admin  272 Jun 14  2015 .  0: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit /code/pre  How do I fix this?  <comment266629> Hmm I forgot to ask for the share config... Are these two clients and a share provided by a server? What are the OSs of the client/server? Where and how is the group *Home* configured? <comment267640> Server is Mac OSX, El Capitan, up to date. The clients are a Mac and a Windows machine. C works from the windows machine, and it is from there I see this problem. The accounts, and the group are all local to the server.  To mee it looks like some SMB (samba?) issue on the Mac Server
