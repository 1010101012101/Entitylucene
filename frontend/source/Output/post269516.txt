Transfer Time Machine files from other sparse bundle <body> I'm trying to transfer 500GB of files from my iMac to my MacBook pro. I don't have the required cables, my external disks are nearly full, WiFi too slow. My idea is hook up my time machine backup disk to my laptop.   Firstly, it's in sparse disk image bundle format, with a red no entry sign on it! I got around this by entering finder using sudo.   So then I tried using time machine, option click - 'browse other backup disks'. The iMac disk is now listed, but when it enters time machine, the finder presented is that of my laptop, and doesn't show the files from the iMac!  Any suggestions on how I can do this?  <comment338560> Would migration assistant work? You can use migration assistant from a TM backup
