How to set up Mail so To: auto completes based on Contacts info? <body> When I type "mom" into the "To:" field, Mail.app doesn't load my mom's email addy:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/386tZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...but when I click the blue "circle/plus" button and type "mom" it does:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uGKRf.png" alt="enter image description here"  In Contacts.app I have my Mom's contact info set up so that her "title" is "Mom".  How do I get Mail.app's To: field to auto complete based on her Contacts.app title? Or, is there something I can do in Mail.app so that "mom" will autocomplete her email addy from the To: field?    macOS Sierra 10.12.4  <answer281711> emTitle/em is intended to be used within the scope of a company. If you want strongMail/strong to recognize names such as “Mom,” try using the emNickname/em field instead:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T8z6h.png" alt="Add Nickname"  On the macOS version of strongContacts/strong, you can go into strongContacts/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongTemplate/strong → strongAdd Field/strong and emcheck/em strongNickname/strong. That field will then become available by default when editing any contact, without requiring you to add it through the strong+/strong menu.
