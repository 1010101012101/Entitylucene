Numbers: apply formula to all rows with same column value <body> I have a dataset and want get some statistics on subsets of this data.br For example find the highest value of column A in all rows that have the same value in their column B and C.    precodePseudoCode: MAX($A) of all rows where ISSAME(B) &amp;&amp; ISSAME(C) /code/pre  Is there any way to achieve this kind of behaviour in a numbers formula?br To clarify:  precodeSample Dataset:   | A |  B    |  C        | result 1 | 4 | blue  | 2015      |   8 2 | 8 | blue  | 2015      |   8 3 | 4 | green | 2015      |   9 4 | 9 | green | 2015      |   9 /code/pre  I want to find the maximum value of A emwithin the subset/em of rows that have the same value in column B AND the same value in column C.  <comment352328> Shouldn't this be `where B == C` (or in other words: Do you want to look only at the subset of rows where `B == C` and get the maximal A value for this subset)?
