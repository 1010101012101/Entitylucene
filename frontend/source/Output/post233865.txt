How to activate lost mode on iCloud for iPhone that cannot be located? <body> I lost my phone in a taxi just after landing at an airport. My phone was in airplane mode and I cannot locate it with iCloud. On iCloud help pages, it says I can turn on the lost mode.  I tried:  ul liLocate my phone, wait for it to fail. No menu appeared to ask if I wanted to lock it/li liGo in Settings - my iPhone. I clicked on "lost your phone ? ...? " which did nothing but bring me to a help page/li /ul  Is that normal ? I'm using Ubuntu/Chrome if it can help.  <answer233866> Login to iCloud, go to Find My iPhone, select your phone in the drop down list on the top of the page, provided it has Find My iPhone enabled it should show up as offline.

The iCloud server will then 'see' the iPhone and set it into Lost mode. Until Airplane Mode is disabled, you are out of luck.  In addition, you will have had to deliberately configured your iPhone to use Find My iPhone. If you did not enable this feature, you are well and truly out of luck.   <comment285964> thanks but I ask because "Lost mode" is not available... can you see it on your computer ?
