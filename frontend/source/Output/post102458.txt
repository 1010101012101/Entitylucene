How can I get VMWare Fusion 6 to display in Unity with full resolution on a Retina display? <body> As a long time (intimately familiar with 3.11) Windows user I finally made the jump to OS X. I was excited to take advantage of the massive resolution on my new MBP, and it's as awesome as I thought it would be.  However, Unity + Windows looks emterrible/em. I realize Windows was not built to take advantage of such jaw-dropping resolutions, but I still want it to run at native resolution. I find myself enjoying the OS X environment, and reluctant to leave it for a full screen Windows VM; Unity is becoming a must.  I've tried checking the 'Use Full Resolution' setting to no avail.  sub(Not sure if it makes a difference, but I'm running the Windows 8.1 preview)/sub  h3How can I prevent Unity mode from displaying Windows in a clunky-looking, zoomed-in, pixelated view?/h3  <answer115521> I don't know if this is the answer you are looking for, but I have a 2013 13" Macbook Pro with 2 1920 x 1080 monitors attached. I'm running the newest version of Mavericks and windows 7.  At first when I was in unity, all my windows were huge and I couldn't figure out why. I tried to change the resolution of windows but that messed everything up and I had to exit and re-enter Unity to fix it.  But when I go Control Panel  Appearance and Personalization Display, you'll see a window that talks about "Make it easier to read what's on your screen" and there are 3 options.  Smaller - 100%; Medium - 125%; Larger - 150%.   For whatever reason, mine started at the 150%, but choosing 100% makes everything fit and look the correct size for my screens.  <answer168625> I had the same issue with Windows 7 guest on a MBP 2013 retina display. It was solved for me by unticking the "Automatically adjust user interface size in Windows" checkbox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/61Ui9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment120640> For a moment there I thought you were running Windows 3.11 in Fusion... with Unity. That would be something to see. <comment126705> For what it's worth, I ended up going with Parallels instead. It handled this quite nicely. <comment126707> How does it handle it? What's different? Does it scale up a low-res virtual screen, or use high-res fonts and Windows scaling, or...? <comment126711> Looks like high-res fonts and Windows scaling. Not entirely sure though, it just 'feels right' and didn't require any fiddling. <comment170694> I have the same setup, but my "Make it easier to read what's on your screen" claimed it was on "Smaller" setting already.  I had to switch to Medium, log out/in then set back to Smaller and log out/in
