Any figures on how wide spread iOS 6.0 is? <body> I am looking for some trustworthy figures on how many iphone users (or all ios users for that matter) that have upgraded to iOS 6.0, compared to how many still run on 5.x.  Does anyone have some reliable figures on this ? Or a good source that could give at least an estimate upon this ?  <answer74780> There is no real way to tell how many iOS 6 downloads there have been (other then Apple itself), but the most popular way to estimate is to use web analytics to compare.  While I haven't seen any recent announcements about the current iOS 6 adoption, Chitika revealed that within a month of being released, 60% of their users were running iOS 6. That was around October 22, 2012.
