Quickest way to save new text file to a folder <body> I have a folder open in finder - what is the quickest way to save a new text file to it?  On Windows I would use "New Text" and then edit the file. On the Mac I open a new file in Sublime or Textedit but then I have to select the folder again when I want to save ...?  <answer130533> You can run the following AppleScript through a service with keyboard shortcut or context menu item.  precodetell application "Finder"   set selection to make new file at (get insertion location) end tell /code/pre  Alternatively, drag the current directory to Terminal and type codetouch filename/code. You can alias the command to something like coden/code for easier activation, and also add closing the Terminal window to the aliased command.  <answer130554> Using terminal would be the quickest, all things considered.  Open a terminal and type codecd/code (including a space) and drop the desired target directory into the terminal window, which will basically input the path directory, and hit enter. Then type codenano [filename]/code, which will give you a text file to write in. When you're done, type ctrl-x (not cmd) to exit, and confirm filename to save to by hitting codey/code.  Alternatively you can combine step one and two by entering codenano path/to/file.txt/code.  <answer130602> The quickest way I've found so far is to  ul lidrag the current folder from the emPath Bar/em to emFavorites/em/li liin Sublime/Textedit do emSave/em, then select the folder from emFavorites/em/li /ul  <answer130607> You can add this line to Your code.bash_profile/code file:  precodealias nf="eval \"cd \\\"\\\`osascript -e 'tell app \\\\\\\"Finder\\\\\\\" to return the POSIX path of (target of window 1 as alias)'\\\`\\\"\" &amp;&amp; touch filename.txt &amp;&amp; open filename.txt" /code/pre  Then if You type codenf/code in strongTerminal.app/strong You will create new emtxt/em file in the location of the topmost strongFinder/strong window and open it with Your default application.   <comment153060> An improvement to this would be to use dterm rather than the built in Terminal.app. Dterm will pop up a command line with the directory set to the folder of the current Finder window, which is handy for all sorts of things : http://decimus.net/dterm. You could just type 'touch filename.txt' in dterm, and a new empty text file would appear in the Finder window straight away, ready to be opened by whichever app you choose. <comment153064> In a similar vein, [PathFinder](http://cocoatech.com/pathfinder/) is a vastly superior file browser for Mac, and allows opening a terminal window from the currently browsed directory with a single click, in addition to many more features that improve on Finder. In fact PathFinder has a right-click 'New File…' option as well.   Though both Dterm and PathFinder are commercial non-free software. <comment153144> I was hoping for a built in command as it's not always my own Mac where I need this. Thanks though! <comment153149> This is built-in ! And it is the easiest I can think of. <comment153167> @hcris There is no predefined new file built in method. This however, requires no external software. I have added another method though — see edit. <comment153171> @grgarside After figuring out to drag to the Terminal dock icon instead of the window I really like your `touch` alternative! Thanks, that work's very well.
