For a given Location, I only want to connect to one specific WiFi connection. How? <body> When I'm at a specific location, I want my MBP to connect to only one specific WiFi connection available.  Too many times it "automatically" connects to garbage WiFi signals like "xfinitywifi" or "CableWifi" that are nearby, and I always have to manually set the connection to the one I really want to use.  Is there a way to limit a macos WiFi connection to a specific WiFi signal?  <answer282618> Source: Here's how to forget a wifi location so that you don't auto-connect to it when in range.    ol liClick the Wi-Fi icon toward the upper right of your screen in the menu bar. It looks like a pizza slice./li liClick on Open Network Preferences. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6O5Om.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the Advanced button./li liClick the Wi-Fi tab.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rckO6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect the network(s) you'd like your Mac to forget./li liClick on the minus (-) button.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MoAmu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick on the OK button./li liClick on the Apply button.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K1S8d.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <comment356111> Are you not willing to 'forget' wifi like xfinitywifi?  I've done this and I never auto-connect to that one.  If I want to connect in the future I have to manually reconnect (which isn't a problem for me because I don't want to connect to it, ever). <comment356114> I'll add it as an answer and you can accept if you like it. <comment356116> Well if you go to `System Preferences  Network  WI-FI (left)  Advanced (button on the right)  WI-FI (fist tab)` , you can drag Wi-Fi networks to preferred order. So if you're near networks A and B and B is above A, B is the one it'll connect to. Would that work for you? <comment356117> @Joonas: That's also helpful.  Thanks. <comment356216> @Joonas has the right idea. Also I would uncheck the box for "Remember network this computer has joined". This will prevent it from remembering these random unsecured networks and automatically joining them.
