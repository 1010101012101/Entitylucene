Application appearing on all spaces in Lion <body> I had a couple of applications set up to be on all spaces when I was running on Snow Leopard, but now that I'm on Lion I want to turn that off.  I can't work out how to do it. Does anyone know how? There doesn't seem to be an option in System Preferences for it. Perhaps there's a plist or something similar I can edit?  <answer22373> When the app is running, you can hold your mouse pressed over the dock icon and change desktop binding to none or a specific space. A secondary click works too.   <answer22374> In the dock you can right click the application, go to Options and de-select the option there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/08hTI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment24807> Picture worth many words - nice! :-) <comment24808> Great, Thanks!!! <comment24809> Great, Thanks!!! <comment24955> I was going to ask a similar question, but I am too late.
