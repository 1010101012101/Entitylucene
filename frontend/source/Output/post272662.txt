OS X Installation USB not detected in Startup Disk selection <body> I have a MacBook Pro 8.2. Recently I have download Sierra and Yosemite, and am currently running El Capitan. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nj94y.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And I created a bootable USB for OS X Yosemite with DiskMaker X 6, in case Sierra goes wrong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KR9jk.png" alt="OSX X and DiskMaker"  But when I try to check the USB, it's not on Startup Disk. I tried the option key on mac boot, but the USB is not there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8qJp.png" alt="USB not detected on Startup Disk"  I'm using SanDisk Cruzer Glide Media, here the USB details.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CrGVo.png" alt="USB Install Disk on Finder" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LTqhQ.png" alt="USB" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yokht.png" alt="USB Volume"  <answer272688> From the last image you posted, the window says "Bootable: No". From the screenshot you posted of the files on the USB, this doesn't look like a standard bootable OS X USB. For Yosemite, you could try using Terminal (I'm not sure how Terminal would handle the periods and dashes in your USB's name, so here are the instructions if your USB is named Untitled):  Note that this process automatically erases and formats the USB before moving the files (it normally will confirm this with you), but I like to erase it myself before I do this as a precaution.  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app /code/pre  After the process finishes, I believe the USB is named "Install OS X Yosemite"  Source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372  <answer272693> In order to boot from an external disk it must have a GUID Partition Map. If your USB disk is not formatted with that you will need to reformat it accordingly.    ol liGo to Disk Utility/li liSelect "Erase"/li liSelect GUID from the "Scheme" dropdown menu/li /ol  <comment342766> I did reformat the USB myself using Disk Utility before DiskMaker X 6 do it again and I let the rest don by it. <comment342767> I did with CLI process using createinstallmedia and the output is the same as DiskMaker did. Not work. <comment342776> does the volume show up when you press alt during boot? <comment342777> No. But it works when installing El Capitan (current system). It also works with Linux dist, and Windows 7
