Does restoring from Time Machine revert also the OS? <body> I want to try updating my MacBook Pro 13" (2013) from Mavericks to Sierra but I am afraid of performance issues. So I would like to be able to downgrade easily if I like.  Does a Time Machine backup allow to do this? I think that if this is the case I would have to restore the backup from the Recovery Mode, right?
