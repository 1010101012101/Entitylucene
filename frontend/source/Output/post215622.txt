OSX crashes and reboots several hours after going to "sleep" (lid closed) <body> I have a MacBook Pro as my work laptop. When I go home, I close the lid and take the laptop with me. Very often, the next time I open my laptop I find that the OS restarted "because of a problem". This reboot may happen several hours after the lid is closed, as the sound from my laptop back indicates.  What is the best way to understand / debug why this is happening? Can I get some useful information from log files?  hr  The laptop is codeMacBookPro11,3/code, with Intel Core i7 processor, and 16 GB of RAM. The programs that are usually running before crash are iTerm, Finder, Microsoft Outlook, and Chrome. I also run a Vagrant VM with a bunch of processes in it for work. My coworkers run exactly the same codebase and none of them is having the same problem.  <answer238090> In my case the issue was related exactly to VMWare. Before putting my laptop to sleep I suspend the VM and the issue doesn't happen. That's a "pause" button in the VMWare UI.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgNAI.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongEdit/strong:  Looks like VMWare sleep functionality is buggy. I once got my entire VM getting to the point of no return. I simply use codevagrant suspend/code these days before putting my laptop to sleep. No need to bring up VMWare UI.  <comment260465> Can you give details on you MacBook, such as the model date and what processor, memory, etc. as well as what apps you use before the crash/going to sleep. <comment260622> i am having the same issue,i would like to know if this is a fairly recent happening? my issue started 1 1/2 - 2 days ago, perhaps if thats when yours started than it might be connected? but yes and i notice the time also varies, even walking up and down stairs is enough time for when i open it to say it needed to restart "because of a problem". here are some of my stats Model Name: MacBook Pro Model Identifier: MacBookPro11,2 Processor Name: Intel Core i7 Processor Speed: 2.2 GHz Number of Processors: 1 Total Number of Cores: 4 L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB L3 Cache: 6 MB Memory: 16 GB Boot ROM <comment260694> My problem has been around since I was given a Mac at work, May 2015. It's definitely been around since I switched to Yousemite. <comment260888> My issue can be a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/169555/using-vmware-fusion-on-yosemite-how-can-i-prevent-crashes-with-sleep-wake-failu as it mentions problems with `VMware Fusion` which we use as a hypervisor. I have this feeling because VMvare is listed in the crash report among other things. <comment291845> I also have this issue on my Mac OSX Yosemite frequently if I don't turn off a VMware Fusion 8.1.0 VM <comment292065> [Combining with changing some of mac's Energy Saver preferences](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/169683/116146), this is a working solution for me and a colleague I talked to yesterday. At least, pausing/unpausing doesn't take as much time as with shut down/restart.
