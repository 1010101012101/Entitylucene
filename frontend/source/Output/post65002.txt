Keyboard Shortcuts for Volume <body> Real quick, I own a Macbook Pro 2010.  I recently purchased a new Razer Naga mouse, and aside from using it for gaming, I've been adding various keyboard shortcuts into my mouse's side buttons. Whenever I try using the buttons to control my Macbook's volume and for controlling music play, I'm noticing that the buttons register as F7 - F12 rather than what I'm intending.  I was wondering, would anyone happen to know the exact keyboard commands in order to control the volume and music playing?  <answer65005> Go into System Preferences  Keyboard and under the Keyboard tab, check of codeUse all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys/code, as in the image below.  Then, you can use the Rewind function as Fn - F7, Play/Pause as Fn - F8, etc (you can then map the buttons on your mouse to these).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zNJNH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer85686> KeyRemap4MacBook worked with my trackball:  precode&lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;private.test&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__PointingButtonToKey__ PointingButton::BUTTON4, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_VOLUME_UP, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__PointingButtonToKey__ PointingButton::BUTTON5, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_VOLUME_DOWN, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <comment76360> I know that, however F12 for instance opens the dashboard rather than do Volume Up like I'm wanting. <comment76361> have you re-assigned F7 - F12 to different functions? <comment76362> No, that is what it normally is whenever you use the actual F# buttons. When attempting to get the features that I want tho on my new mouse, it registers the actual F# rather than the special symbols <comment76363> ok thanks, editing answer accordingly
