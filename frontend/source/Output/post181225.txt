How do I find files with no extension in Finder? <body> I'm trying to find all files that have no extension in a Finder folder.  I know how to search by extension and exclude a specific extension but what do I type in the box if I want no extension at all?   <answer181342> You can set up a Finder search like this:  precode- None of the following is true: - - Filename contains . - - Kind is Folder /code/pre  The Finder does however exclude some system items from search results. The same search criteria produced 19'077 search results in Finder and 131'666 in HoudahSpot.  <comment215491> how can there be a file without extension (you mean it is not showing it?) <comment215525> @Buscarì›ƒ not every file requires an extension. For example Brewfiles or shell scripts don't need an extension like .sh or so.
