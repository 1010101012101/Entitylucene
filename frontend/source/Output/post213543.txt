Mac doesn't go into sleep mode <body> Sometimes my mac mini doesn't go into standby after the inactivity time specified in system settings. This happened with Yosemite, and continues to happen with El Capitan.  Quite sure, there is some application that prevents sleep, but I'm still unable to identify it. Is there a systematic way to identify the guilty application?  <answer213544> Click CMD + OPTION + ESC and check for applications that you think my be running and refreshing itself in the background to try and pinpoint what is causing this issue. It should still be going to sleep regardless.  Im not sure what your settings are, but go and check them anyways.br - Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongDisplay/strong  From what it sounds like, you have it set to never turn off the display, here you can tell the computer when to turn the display off which will make it go to sleep. Set this to what you want it to be by scrolling the bar to either the left or the right and you should be good to go.  <answer264832> After trying everything i could find on the web, i figured out that it was a page in the (HP) printer queue that was keeping my Mac from sleeping for days. Turned on the printer, forced the page to print and my Mac is now FINALLY going back to sleep.    There was no indication of this in the Activity Monitor nor the "pmset -g assertions" command that pointed to anything printer related. Hope this helps someone !  <comment257802> The display turns off, but the mac stays awake.
