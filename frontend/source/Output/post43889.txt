iTunes on OS X: How to rename files using in-line editing in main window, using keyboard only? <body> When I'm on my Windows computer and using iTunes, I can conveniently hit the strongF2/strong key when I have a song selected, rename the song using the in-line edit field that appears, and then hit strongEnter/strong to commit the change.  No mouse or emGet Info/em dialog is used in the process.  strongIs there a keyboard-only method in iTunes on OS X for quickly renaming a song?/strong  On OS X, I can avoid iTunes' emGet Info/em dialog by using the mouse to click twice ... not emdouble/em clicking, but rather: click, wait, click again .. (and getting the timing right is annoying!)  Such clicking activates in-line editing functionality (so I know it exists) but it requires the mouse. How can I activate the in-line editing functionality with just the keyboard?  I tried strongF2/strong on OS X and that didn't work.  I also tried strongEnter/strong, which can be used to in-line edit file names in Finder, but that didn't work either :-/  I'm interested in renaming files with the keyboard only because I have a ton of songs imported with em"Artist Name - Song Name"/em titles to correct.  <answer43891> There sure is.  When you have a song selected, you can press kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdreturn/kbd and it will allow you to quickly edit the song title.  <comment49885> **Thank you!**  Works.  I'll mark this as accepted as soon as I can (there's a minimum 10 minute wait :-)  Would you happen to know if there is a list of iTunes keyboard shortcuts anywhere? <comment49886> Yes, sir. [It's on Apple's website](http://www.apple.com/itunes/how-to/shortcuts.html). I'm not sure if that one is on there or not. I just happened to know about it already. <comment49888> Thanks; that list looks familiar.  Yes, oddly, the shortcut in your answer for renaming a file is *not* on that list, or I'd have learned about it sooner.  :-)  Would be nice if Apple accepted feedback on such pages. <comment49890> You can always provide Apple with feedback on their [feedback site](http://www.apple.com/feedback/). Not sure if it does anything, but at least you'll be heard by somebody :) <comment49959> Enter (⌤ or fn-return) should also be equivalent to ⌘↩. <comment65003> Cool.  (that is the Enter key by the number pad). <comment269655> As an alternative to renaming the tracks manually, there are various scripts on the Doug's Applescripts for iTunes site that could help automate it - http://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php
