I know about Skitch but when you said it above I thought it was some american word i'd never heard of :) <comment108887> @bmike, totally. I (used to) love Skitch for SE screenshots. The problem is the drag and drop function no longer works. :-( I have to save - upload it now. I'll have to check Napkin out.
