Mail not showing up in inbox on El Capitan <body> When I open Apple Mail, I see the normal mailboxes and stuff, but nothing shows up in my inbox.  Not unread messages or read messages.   I have to click into another mailbox and click back to get it to show up.    It is a relatively minor thing, but very annoying.   Any help is much obliged.   strongI did rebuild the mailbox, and it didn't fix the problem./strong  Running El Capitan on a 2015 Macbook pro, I use a gmail account.  <comment279806> Have you tried rebuilding your Inbox? `Mailbox` â†’ `Rebuild` after selecting your Inbox. <comment280199> @Phong yes. I tried that.
