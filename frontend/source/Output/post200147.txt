Copying AFP Path with Automator <body> I'm updating a Service I created in Automator a few years ago that copies a file path with a certain format in order to be clickable in "Messages".  The problem now is that it doesn't work with new software like Lync or Slack, and I've realized the AFP file path is the only format that works.  Currently I run the following Shell Script:     sed -e 's/:///g' -e 's/\ /%20/g' -e 's/^/file:///g' | pbcopy   Is there an easy way to get the AFP file path (ex. afp://svr001/Public/Team/TEMPLATES/TEMPLATE.txt) with server and all, given the input from the finder?  Thank you very much.
