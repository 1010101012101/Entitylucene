Is there a way to sort in Aperture based on an arbitrary Exif or IPTC field? <body> While I can emsearch/em on lots of stuff, I don't seem so sort on much.  At present in Aperture you can sort on rating, date, filename, label, keywords, file size, version name, orientation.  The keywords is an odd duck:  It sorts on the alphabetical list of the keywords.  So everything that has the tag apple comes before anything with the keyword banana.  Is there anyway to sort on other fields.  E.g.  could an add on calculate the hash of the image portion (not the metadata) of each file, stuff that into a custom aperture field, then sort by that field.  A half hour groveling with google finds no aperture plugins that do this.
