Control-F2 "Move Focus to Menu Bar" only works occasionally <body> I don't want to use my trackpad too much due to a strain injury, hence I use the Control F2 "Move Focus to Menu Bar" a lot.  However this feature only works occasionally, it can work for hours and then suddenly stop working, sometimes I can fix in the Keyboard Shortcuts pref pane by unchecking and checking the "Move Focus to Menu Bar" checkbox, at other times it takes a restart of the system.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XI4LB.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm a big Apple fan-boy, and I always marvel at the cool features in OSX, this is the first time I have a Windows-esque experience with the OSX UI :(  <answer12776> When you're sure you've got your Fn key settings the way you want them and it STILL doesn't work:  My solution:  ol liGo back into Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts pane./li liFor the item "Move focus to the menu bar", assign a DIFFERENT function key, other than F2. (Something you're not using, like, say...^F9...or whatever.)/li liNow use THAT key instead./li /ol  Sounds kind of nuts, I know.  And it's annoying to use a different key.  But I've found that ^F2 just won't consistently work after I've been using enough 3rd party programs, particularly if they're complex.  Sometimes ^F3 will also fail, and that keyboard pane can start acting a little strange on its own to be honest.  This does seem to work though.  hr  coder  <answer42441> Same here: ^F2 almost never worksbr Workaround that works for me (without assigning new shortcut): press ^F3 and then immediately ^F2   <answer42445> ul liI've had the same struggle with keyboard shortcuts to the menu bar (tried many different combinations)./li /ul  the only one that has consistently worked is the help shortcut ⇧ ⌘ ? (shift+command+/)  from the help menu just use the arrows to navigate to file/edit/view…  <answer90590> I asked a question in the following link and got a hint to answer your question:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16390279/applescript-to-show-apple-menu-bar-items  What I do is as follows:  ol licreate an .app using Automator using the scrip in the above link,/li licreate a hot key for the .app,/li licreate a key stroke linked to the hot key (using KeyRemap4MacBook in my case)./li /ol  It works great for me at least.  <comment13578> That seems to work! You're lifesaver, thx a bunch :) <comment13932> Well, some time have past and I have the exactly same problem with this approach :( <comment48459> I've solved this problem by mapping a keycombo with Keyboard Maestro to simulate pressing the Apple icon in the upper left corner of the screen. <comment106339> Or see [this question](http://superuser.com/questions/153890/assign-a-shortcut-to-running-a-script-in-os-x/264943#264943) for other ways to assign shortcuts to scripts. Automator applications have a maybe 100-500 ms delay at the start. <comment106361> Wow, elegant! Thanks d(^o^) <comment109597> This works, plus you can just type the command you want to find immediately. <comment193335> My experience: after if fails with the "new" key mapping, switch it back to the original one, and it typically starts working again. Then I toggle between these two mappings to make it work when one (mapping) starts failing. Which is unfortunately often. <comment229486> What an absolute disaster! I'm still seeing this issue on Yosemite.
