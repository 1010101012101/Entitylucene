It sounds like you got it unwantedly. <comment77714> +1 solved my problem although the support url is broken. <comment77719> Works for me, though theres a long lasting bug with Apple's support site. Trying again usually suffices. <comment367174> This isn't working for me. I read the support article before searching here. I just keep getting a failed to authenticate error... (I have confirmed that my password is correct). Thoughts?
