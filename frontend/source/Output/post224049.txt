hditutil tool will not convert .iso to .img? <body> This is not working for me! Will someone clarify why?  Here's the command I'm using:  precodehdiutil convert -format UDRAW -o /Users/Jacob/Desktop/destination_file.img /Users/Jacob/Downloads/debian-8.2.0-amd64-DVD-3.iso /code/pre  And here's what terminal returns:  precodeUsage: hdiutil convert -format &lt;format&gt; -o &lt;outfile&gt; [options] &lt;image&gt;        hdiutil convert -help /code/pre  <answer224059> The proper command to use is:  precodehdiutil convert -format UDRW -o /Users/Jacob/Desktop/destination_file.img /Users/Jacob/Downloads/debian-8.2.0-amd64-DVD-3.iso /code/pre  (source with an OS X how-to)  In UDRW RW doesn't stand for RAW but for R/W (readable and writable)!  <comment271667> man hdutil only lists four character formats - however it also has the image as raw first parameter so could be wrong <comment271669> Unfortunately, almost every Q&A forum has this posted as the way to convert an ISO to IMG in order to create a bootable USB for Linux OS installation. If you have a more effective method, please elaborate. <comment271671> What does UDRAW stand for and which site shows this - googling gives me lines using UDRW as per man page <comment271677> @rbApostate The raw img format you mention is an image of a real CD including the CIRC data (similar to the bin/cue files). It doesn't make **any** sense to convert an iso to an img file because the source is no physical CD. <comment271707> @rbApostate, Did you try running `hdiutil convert -help` as the `Usage` output shows? It shows the proper Usage and Image Formats to form a proper command line.
