How do I find out what computers I have authorized? <body> I just authorized iTunes against a laptop and I was expecting it to be my third of five computers authorized on my iTunes account. But iTunes said it was the fourth.  How do I find out what machines are authorized against my account?  <answer76133> Go to iTunes on a computer and select your Account (on the right hand side of the window towards the top once you are signed in). Select Manage Devices under iTunes in the Cloud. All computers in this list count against the 5 total computer authorizations each Apple ID can have.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/meMmA.png" alt="Manage Devices"  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#SALE/li /ul  <answer90367> It looks like there is no way to see which specific computers are authorized; you can only see how many are authorized.  Per this Apple discussion thread, you will have to deauthorize all of them and reauthorize only the ones you want to be able to play.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3065517?start=0&amp;tstart=0  I'm not sure if devices count toward this limit.  <answer112346> The question asks about computer emAuthorization./em But some of the answers here confuse emAuthorization/em with emAssociation./em I'd like to clarify the terms first, using Apple's own definitions, then answer the question.  strongAuthorization/strong     Authorization refers to emcomputers/em only. emAuthorizing/em a computer allows you to play media purchased from the iTunes Store with a specific Apple ID. In order to use apps, audiobooks, books, DRM-protected music, and movies on a computer it must be emAuthorized./em Each Apple ID can emauthorize/em a maximum of 5 emcomputers./em      You can deauthorize each computer individually. If you've forgotten which computers you have authorized in the past, there is emnot/em a way to list all emauthorized/em computers. Apple only tells you the emnumber/em that are authorized. However, once a year you can codeDeauthorize All/code computers from within your iTunes Store account settings.      More information about emAuthorization/em can be found in this Apple Tech Note.   strongAssociation/strong     Association allows you to download past iTunes purchases onto a different emdevice./em Apple calls this emiTunes in the Cloud./em In addition, emassociation/em allows the use of Apple features such as emiTunes Match/em and emAutomatic Downloads./em      You can emassociate/em up to 10 emdevices/em with each Apple ID. By emdevice/em Apple means an iOS gadget or an emauthorized/em computer. (Since every emassociated/em computer must also be emauthorized/em that limits you to 5 emassociated/em computers for these features.) So you can emassociate/em one computer and 9 other devices, or 5 computers and 5 other devices, but emnot/em 9 computers and 1 other device. You're limited to 5 emcomputers./em      There emis/em a list of emassociated/em devices which can be found in the emAccount/em section if iTunes Store.      For more information on emAssociation/em see this Apple Tech Note   strongSo the only way to determine which computers are emauthorized/em is by trial and error:/strong Deauthorize each computer you own in turn using codeStore &gt; Deauthorize This Computerâ€¦/code within iTunes.  If after doing this the iTunes Store still says you have authorized computers, you only have one option: Use the codeDeauthorize All/code feature of iTunes Store, and then emreauthorize/em the computers you own. But keep in mind, Apple only allows you to codeDeauthorize All/code once every twelve months.  strongSpecial note about about Association and Android phones./strong  Using Apple's own definition from the Support site.  You can't view a list of your associated devices or remove any of your associated devices using an Android phone, but strongAndroid phones do count/strong against your ten-device limit.  More information about Authorization and Association can be found on the View and remove your associated devices in iTunes page.  <answer231467> Here is your answer...very simple too:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PKWZOz8xHE&amp;ebc=ANyPxKr8RtiU1gndwOD89pQjeldPCTWPBD2o4JUkdc8KvSyQK-IG0FdkB-ki__XSsT0GHvAHPR5cK-YVCe2Cpq_WdezUiL5qeA  <comment88341> Hmm. That list is completely wrong. It shows two Macs (should be three) -- neither of which are the new Mac I just added. An iPad and two iPhones. I thought iDevices didn't count, it was only computers. So as to where it's getting 4/5 from is still a mystery to me. <comment88344> Open a ticket with [iTunes billing support](http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/account/) if the information is outdated or incorrect. They can and should reset things if your account doesn't match what iTunes lists. The once a year reset does complicate things since some older computers could be authorized against the "last 5 slots" and not the "current 5 slots". <comment88356> My list is empty. But apparently I have authorized five devices already since Home Sharing cannot be activated on my Mac. <comment88404> @bmike so Apple just reset all the authorized devices on my account for me and had me re-authorize the three Macs. I get the right "out of 5" count now but the list of devices under 'Manage Devices' only shows my iDevices, no Macs, now. Go figure. <comment88635> @IanC. What you describe matches my experience with a reset. Any computers and devices continue to work and cen re-auorize yet no longer show or enumerate on a list of user machines. <comment131874> @grgarside. The *Manage Devices* screen you are showing is for *associations* not *authorizations.* Confusing, I know, but Apple defines these similar terms very differently. See my answer for clarification and a working solution to the original question. <comment131876> @GrowlTiger I simply added a screenshot to the answer following the instructions provided in the answer itself. Indeed, I had not noticed that the list showed associations rather than authorisations, but regardless, the screenshot that I added is of the page that the original answer referred to. <comment131882> You cannot be associated without being authorized, so the latter is a subset of the former. Furthermore, this is the only list you can get from Apple to tell what computers are authorized by virtue of being both authorized+associated. <comment132777> @bmike Your statement is only partially correct: A *computer* can only be associated if it is authorized. But authorization does not apply to iOS devices at all, even though they *can* be associated. More applicable to the original question, though, is that the *association* list need not contain *all* authorized devices. For example, I have 5 authorized computers, but only *three* devices in my *associated* list. So the associated list *may not necessarily* indicate the names of *all* of one's authorized computers. <comment217559> @GrowlTiger 's explanation is the answer here. <comment269032> This answer is correct while the chosen answer is not.
