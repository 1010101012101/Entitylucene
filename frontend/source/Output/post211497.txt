Install new NANO (2.4) using BREW but still uses old versions (symbolic link not created?) <body> I installed NANO 2.4 but my OS X is still using 2.0. I beleive its something to do with the symbolic link that wasn't created.  I first tapped the homebrew/dupes so i could brew install nano  precode~  brew tap homebrew/dupes ==&gt; Tapping homebrew/dupes  ~  brew install nano ==&gt; Installing nano from homebrew/homebrew-dupes /code/pre  If I do a   precodewhich nano /code/pre  I get  precode/usr/bin/nano /code/pre  but the brew installed in the directory below and I have it confirmed as 2.4 by running the program directlt from here  precode/usr/local/Cellar/nano/2.4.2_1/bin /code/pre  I think a symbolic link wasn't created becasue nano is already included with mac os x, is it safe to override it ?  I got the following warning on the brew install from  precode==&gt; Downloading https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-6.0.tar.gz ######################################################################## 100.0% ==&gt; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/ncurses/6.0 --enable-pc-files --enable ==&gt; make install ==&gt; Caveats This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.  OS X already provides this software and installing another version in parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.  Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your build variables:      LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib     CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/ncurses/include  ==&gt; Summary   /usr/local/Cellar/ncurses/6.0: 1970 files, 21M, built in 114 seconds /code/pre  <answer211501> You can always create a symlink in code/usr/local/bin/code manually, which (depending on the order of path components in code$PATH/code) will then shadow the standard binary in code/usr/bin/code. As codenano/code is used interactively only, the risk of breaking anything is probably rather small.   <answer273300> I was having the same issue, the reason was, wrong path priority.  To fix you have to edit /etc/paths (global system file) and set /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin.  In my case, my paths file was:  precode/usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /usr/local/bin /code/pre  And I modified to:  precode/usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /code/pre  Then save the file and restart the terminal session. All OK after that.  <comment255307> hi. Yes it appears that a symlink already exists in /usr/local/bin <comment255308> 31B Oct 18 10:42 nano - ../Cellar/nano/2.4.2_1/bin/nano <comment255309> but the usr/bin is taking precedence over the /usr/local/bin <comment255310> Is the simple answer here to remove NANO from the /usr/bin ? I noticed my path has the /usr/local/bin first, so I don't know why its not picking it up echo $PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin <comment255311> Just start a new shell then, the old path is still hashed <comment255313> No way :-) That was it.... thanks! <comment257327> Use `brew link --force nano` to make the symlink.
