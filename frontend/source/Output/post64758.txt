How can I get `defaults write com.apple.screencapture` to change screen capture location in Mountain Lion <body> I used to be able to set the key codelocation/code under codecom.apple.screencapture/code to change the save location for the system-wide screen capture facility.  This doesn't work for me anymore -- screenshots save to the Desktop regardless of the setting of codelocation/code. Here's what codedefaults/code says:  precode$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture {  location = "/Users/jogloran/Desktop/Screenshots"; } /code/pre  <answer64764> Works for me quite happily.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gxdIC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Have you restarted UIserver?  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  Does the path exist?  UPDATE: If the screen capture cannot find or write to the designated folder, it will default to the current user's desktop.  <comment76100> +1 for this. As well, have you made sure to include the "location" portion of the command? I forgot to do this myself a couple times and never got any correction from the command line. <comment76105> @Veil I'm sure he has, as the output of the defaults read command gives a valid looking path <comment76121> I definitely have. The path does exist. I've tried restarting SystemUIServer too -- this persists through reboots. <comment76161> @jogloran if screen capture cannot find or write to the folder, then it will default to the Desktop.  Check your file permissions on the folder, triple check the path, and all else fails, run repair permissions. <comment76444> It was a permissions issue on that folder in the end.
