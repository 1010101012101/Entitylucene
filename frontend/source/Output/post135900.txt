iPhone 5C Messages crashing after showing no messages <body> When I open my iPhone 5C Messages, all that appears is a white screen that is frozen. It will close on it's own in a minute or so and it still appears as being open when you check to see what applications are open.  I have received two messages that I can not read or get to. How to fix the Messages?  <answer135914> Start off by looking here for how to close open apps in iOS7. Close Messages, then try opening it again. If that fails, close Messages again, turn the phone off completely (by holding the sleep/wake button down), wait a few minutes, turn the phone on again and try looking at your messages again.
