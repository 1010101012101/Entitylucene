OS X network service order doesn't stick <body> Under codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Network -&gt; Set Service Order.../code (OS X 10.9.4) I changed the order for the configured network services to my desires. However, every time my 3G modem connects to the internet it is set as the first service and the order is reverted. (I experience something similar with a VPN service.) This is really annoying since I have a limited data plan on my 3G modem and do emnot/em want to use it if a wireless network is available.   How can I make the service order stay as I configured it?  [Edit] Here is what my console says:  precodecom.apple.kextd[12] Kext id com.huawei.driver.HuaweiDataCardDriver not found; removing personalities from kernel. com.apple.kextd[12] String/URL conversion failure. kernel[0]   USBMSC Identifier (non-unique): FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 0x12d1 0x1f01 0x102, 2 kernel[0]   SAM Multimedia: READ or WRITE failed, SENSE_KEY = 0x05, ASC = 0x20, ASCQ = 0x00 kernel[0]   SAM Multimedia: READ or WRITE failed, SENSE_KEY = 0x05, ASC = 0x20, ASCQ = 0x00 kernel[0]   SAM Multimedia: READ or WRITE failed, SENSE_KEY = 0x05, ASC = 0x20, ASCQ = 0x00 kernel[0]   SAM Multimedia: READ or WRITE failed, SENSE_KEY = 0x05, ASC = 0x20, ASCQ = 0x00 kernel[0]   SAM Multimedia: READ or WRITE failed, SENSE_KEY = 0x05, ASC = 0x20, ASCQ = 0x00 kernel[0]   hfs: mounted HiLink on device disk2s0s2 mds[35] (Normal) Volume: volume:0x7fd1899b1800 ********** Bootstrapped Creating a default store:1 SpotLoc:(null) SpotVerLoc:(null) occlude:0 /Volumes/HiLink Finder[209] FIXME: IOUnserialize has detected a string that is not valid UTF-8, "���".

If NOT:  Your preferences changes are not been saved due:  Possibly your user permissions (ACLs) need refreshing.  <comment170554> It would be interesting to see the log in your Console at the time of the event. <comment170766> I think you meant `NetworkInterfaces.plist`? I am not trying to change the order of the wireless networks (which is what is apparently stored in `com.apple.airport.preferences.plist`), but the order of the network interfaces. Resetting the ACLs did not help. <comment170767> And yes, the preference file for the interfaces is written correctly, but changed back as soon as my modem connects.
