Games dont get past loading screen on Bootcamp Windows 10 <body> I have installed Windows 10 in my bootcamp partition of 70 gb and I have about a 50 gb of free space. But when I try to play a game (non-steam) It does boot up, gets into the loading screen but gets in a load loop or just stays there with a black screen every time. But this is not the case when I install it on my Seagate 1TB USB 3.0 hard drive, they work perfectly.  Any suggestions to how I make it work?  <comment371505> What games have you tried? <comment371582> @books453 far cry 3, ac rogue, just cause 2, crysis 2 etc <comment371672> Do normal installed applications(not from Windows Store) work fine(eg. Chrome, VLC, Evernote, or Dropbox)? <comment371753> @books453 yea only games and not even they just don't open up they do but get stuck while loading
