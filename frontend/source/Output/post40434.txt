How do you configure airport extreme with dynamic dns? <body> I have a domain via Namecheap. They support dynamic dns updates. I'd like to use my airport extreme (firmware 7.6.1) to do the DNS updates, anyone know how to accomplish this?  Here's the info about namecheap's dynamic dns. http://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/category.aspx/11/dynamic-dns  For what it's worth, I am willing to pay the $30 a year to use DynDNS instead, if I could get instructions for setting up the Airport Extreme.  <answer40482> DynDNS does support Multicast DNS (mDNS), which provides the ability to do dynamic DNS and much more. They even have handy dandy instructions for setting it up with an Airport Device. It will cost you a $30/yr standard account, though.   <answer102155> you dont need to pay dyndns, setup a standard dyndns host free with a purchased domain name then follow their instructions for apple airport setup, it takes 5 minutes and you get your own choice of domain name not a *.dyndns.org  <comment45776> Wow - this is a welcome change. So much better than needing to run a computer and software to always report back what the current IP is in response to pings and traceroute tracking. <comment93646> Did you experience problems setting it up? The page says that you will get the details after clicking through the setup process (http://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/595/11/how-to-enable-dynamic-dns-option-for-a-domain) <comment121538> My dns service provider does not support TSIG, so that is not true. My DNS service allows updates only through https and the Airport does not do that.
