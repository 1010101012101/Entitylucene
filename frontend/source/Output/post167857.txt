How do I resize an ex-CoreStorage volume? <body> I've got a Macbook Pro Retina (with the PCIe drive ‘blade’, instead of a traditional 2.5" laptop drive). I've recently upgraded the internal drive from 500GB to 1TB, and codedd/code'd the old drive over the new one to retain my partition setup and Bootcamp partition.  Unfortunately, this didn't go well: for whatever reason, OS X wouldn't recognize, once I'd booted up on the new 1TB drive, that there was 500GB of new space available. It was showing up in Disk Utility as greyed-out space.  To aid in debugging this, I wiped out the Bootcamp partition entirely (I have backups. I intend to restore that later, once I've got the drive fixed up from within OS X.); and eventually, after getting fed up trying to get codediskutil cs resizeStack/code to work, I codediskutil cs revert/code'ed the boot volume entirely.  hr  Now I have this situation:  precode&gt; diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Fannie's HD             499.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 &gt; diskutil cs list No CoreStorage logical volume groups found &gt; diskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 limits For device disk0s2 Fannie's HD:         Current size:  499.4 GB (499418034176 Bytes)         Minimum size:  330.0 GB (329959456768 Bytes)         Maximum size:  499.4 GB (499418034176 Bytes) /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pr0hG.png" alt=""  After trying to drag the single partition in Disk Utility from 500GB up to 1TB, and then clicking ‘apply’, the process appears to proceed, and complete; but as soon as the completion message appears in the bottom-right, the partition map reverts to what you see in the screenshot. It never succeeds in re-sizing to 1TB. (Here's the verbose log, along with some other details obtained from the command-line.)  (Attempting to do the same from the recovery partition's Disk Utility gives an ‘Error: could not unmount disk.)  At this point, all I want in the world, is to re-size the single partition on my drive from 500GB to fill the available 1TB of space. Once I succeed with this, I'll be able to convert it to a CoreStorage volume, encrypt it, partition for Bootcamp and such.

I have no idea why, after all the things I tried, but it worked! Thank you so much, guys.
