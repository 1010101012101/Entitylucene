Archive to Gmail Fails, but only when using the Archive Button on the Toolbar <body> If I try to archive an email using the toolbar 'archive' button I get this error message:  "The IMAP command “UID COPY” (to Archive) failed for the mailbox “INBOX” with server error: No folder Archive (Failure)."  However, if I manually drag the email to all mail, it archives just fine.  Any ideas?  <answer63205> Go to strongMail.app / Preferences / Accounts / MailBoxes/strong and under emTrash/em, uncheck emStore deleted messages on the server/em.  Usually this does the trick.
