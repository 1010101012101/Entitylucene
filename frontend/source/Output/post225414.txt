Please refer also to the following pics, to see what's exactly your case.  In general, a dotted-lined iCloud icon means that it is waiting to be uploaded.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pDKEN.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BCsLP.png" alt="enter image description here"  In order to force the sync, you can try to open the document that you are trying to upload, make whatever modification to the file (even just a point or a comma somewhere) and then save. In this way, you should make the file sync.   <comment273501> I have waited it to upload more then one hour, can I force it to upload ? <comment273504> Try to:  1) delete the file from iCloud, and then re-upload again or  2) opening the documents that you are trying to upload, making whatever modification to the file (even just a point or a comma somewhere) and then save. In this way, you should make the file sync. <comment273509> I have tried it and no luck, still I get this dotted cloud icon near my document
