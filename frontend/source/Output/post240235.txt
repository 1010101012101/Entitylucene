date command gives no output <body> I made an alias earlier today that I saved in my .bash_profile. The alias was called date. I had momentarily forgotten that codedate/code is already a native command on OS X (and Linux) in code/bin/code. I removed the alias that I had saved, but now, to use the codedate/code command, I have to type code/bin/date/code instead of just codedate/code. How can I fix this?  <answer240251> Firstly, check your code$PATH/code (run codeecho $PATH/code)br If code/bin/code isn't there, then run codeexport PATH=/bin:$PATH/code  After that run codewhich date/code and you should see code/bin/date/code  If you still don't have any output, check if codedate/code isn't alias (run codealias date/code)br It should say codebash: alias: date: not found/code.    But in your case it may be codealias date='some-command'/codebr If it is, run codeunalias date/code and it should fix the problem.  Thanks Allan for the comments with answer.  <comment295189> In Terminal, type `echo $PATH` and post the results.  I am betting `/bin` is not in your path system environment variable <comment295190> @Allan here is the result: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Developer/Panda3D/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin <comment295192> It seems `/bin` is in there.  Execute these two commands:  `which date` and `alias`  Either there is a problem with `date` or you have a blank alias set up for `date` <comment295193> Got it. date was still set to the alias I had set before. I ran unalias date and it works now. Than you! <comment295195> Go ahead and answer your own question with the result.  I'll up vote ya...
