How do you remove a playlist from iTunes match? <body> I would like to remove a bunch of playlists from iTunes on my PC and have those removed playlists disappear from my other devices and computers.  I tried deleting them all from the PC and leaving them deleted for around a week. They came back.  I tried deleting them all from the PC and then running 'update iTunes match'. They also came back.  What can I do to make them go away and never return?
