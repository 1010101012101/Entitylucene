Finder does not show Path Bar and Status Bar, what to do? <body> I have OS X Lion and when I open a finder window everything seems OK. But I can't see the Path Bar nor the Status bar.  When I activate one of the bars with View-Show Status Bar or View-Show Path Bar the Finder window gets bigger in height ( growing downwards ), nothing else happens.  Anyone have an idea what I can do to see the Bars?  (The Bars are working in other applications like Safari, âŒ˜+/ and it pops up)  <answer20193> Remove the Finder plist. You can find it at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist.  Then restart. This should reset any strange preferences keeping the Finder from showing the path and status bars.  <answer23115> Is it just this you are looking for? Finder  View  Show Path Bar?  Also here: http://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/findertip1.htm  <answer32050> The bug did come from BetterSnapTool. An app for resizing the windows.  <comment22407> I restarted it, nothing changed. Do you have the same problem or does it work for you? <comment22417> I updated my answer to remove the Finder plist before restarting. Does that fix it? <comment22418> In Lion you can't see the Library by default. If you option click the Finder "Go" menu you can see and select the Library and open it. <comment22588> I used Houdine to toggle visibility of the Library folder :D <comment22589> The error occurs sometimes now... but it disappears when I do your trick with deleting the plist <comment22613> It may be Houdine or something causing these errors if they aren't fully compatible with Lion. You may want to check that too. <comment22717> Good idea thanks <comment25937> I know what it is, it just doesn't show up sometimes, so I have to reboot :(. It's a bug, like the one not displaying the desktops in mission control. (and I have a new MacBook Pro) <comment35156> If you create a new user account, do they appear in that account? <comment36763> And how did you solve it? Remove BetterSnapTool, upgrading to a lion-compatible version or something else? <comment38068> I didn't solve it, right now with the newest patches for OS X Lion and Better Snap Tool the bug persists. I wrote an email with a picture to the developer 3 months ago.
