Mac mini starting itself when power is applied <body> Having a weird issue with a Mac mini.  At the end of the day, I perform a full shutdown.  The main power is then turned off.  When the main power is turned back on again, the Mac mini is automatically turning itself on and starting up. I don't want it to do this.  Under the Energy Saver settings in System Preferences, start automatically after a power failure is unchecked. There is also nothing in the Schedule that would cause the machine to turn on.  Any ideas why my Mac won't stay off when the main power is reapplied?  EDIT - pmset -g output  precodeActive Profiles: AC Power        -1* Currently in use: hibernatemode        0 womp                 0 networkoversleep     0 sleep                20 Sleep On Power Button 1 ttyskeepawake        1 hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage autorestart          0 disksleep            10 displaysleep         20 /code/pre  EDIT 2  If I understand correctly, I will be resetting the SMC every day because the main power is removed from the machine. As per; https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201295  Could the fact that the SMC is being reset make the machine power on the next time main power is applied?  <comment320429> What does `pmset -g` (in Terminal) print? Also, have you tried resetting its [NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204063) and [SMC](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295)? <comment320776> @gordon  added pmset -g output to original question.  I believe so, is this not happening everytime the main power is removed for more than 15 seconds as per - https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201295 <comment320785> Please go to system settings - Energy Safer and check if the option **Start up automatically after a power failure** ist enabled. Disable it and test. <comment320786> @dante12 - please read the original post. Already mentioned that this is unchecked. <comment320787> Ok there is not the right way but in /Library/Preferences there is an com.apple.PowerManagement.plist (may be different location of mine) check if the Automatic Restart at power loss is enabled - disable it.. Make a backup of of your old plist - file before you change anything. I reccomended you should Edit the plist file with an applicatively Editor or with xCode. <comment320796> @dante12 keyAutomatic Restart On Power Loss/key                         integer0/integer  the plist file reflects the setting from the Settings GUI - automatic restart is disabled. <comment320799> Why do you remove the power? <comment320859> @OzzieSpin    The Mac mini is in an office environment. End of day procedures kill the power to all mains outlets.
