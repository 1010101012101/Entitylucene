WD My Passport Ultra does not mount in Sierra <body> For some reason my Western Digital My Passport Ultra does not mount in macOS Sierra. I've tried plugging it in Safe Mode and I was able to access it (emIt mounted just fine/em). I've also tried plugging it in a different MBP(r) that uses El Capitan and it also worked fine. So therefore I'm assuming the problem could be caused by Sierra.  When I tried to mount it using Disk Utility GUI it did not respond. Nothing happened. When I tried mounting it using command line   precodediskutil mount "readOnly" /dev/disk2s1 /code/pre  I got this error back even before I used the "readOnly" option  precodeIf the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option /code/pre  GUI and CLI results:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g4rlw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      FDisk_partition_scheme                       *2.0 TB     disk2    1:               Windows_NTFS My Passport             2.0 TB     disk2s1 /code/pre  Does anyone have the same experience as mine and manage to find a solution?   <comment354446> You are probably not the only one, we have several [similar questions](https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=WD+Passport+Ultra), unfortunately mostly unanswered. Does the disk show up in Disk Utility? Do you get more output if you use `mount`or `hdiutil` to mount it? Is there anything worth mentioning in `/var/log/system.log`? <comment354447> Also, http://support.wdc.com/knowledgebase/answer.aspx?h=p1&ID=14925&lang=en&p=232#macdas offers some ideas (yeah, I'm not convinced either, but give them a try :-)) <comment354451> Thank you for your suggestions, Patrix. Yes, it's showing up in both GUI and command line (diskutil). In the GUI it's grayed out while in the command line https://www.dropbox.com/s/blx6s47zg9o700p/hd-wd-issue.jpg.   I've checked system.log and I don't think there is worth mentioning :/ <comment354454> Is the a new drive without anything on it? If it has nothing on it, have you tried formatting it as HFS+ from Safe Mode or the command line, that is if you don't need it to be NTFS? <comment354456> Unfortunately, It has some files and I don't have a spare hard drive to where I can transfer the files temporarily. <comment354458> Have you manually modified `/etc/fstab` to enable write support for NTFS, or do you have any third-party software installed that enables write support for NTFS? <comment354472> Thank you @user3439894.  I did modified fstab but I still can't mount it https://www.dropbox.com/s/u1l86vfcoajkg7i/Screen%20Shot%202017-04-23%20at%2011.23.14%20PM.png. I also had Tuxera and Paragon installed, they were not able to help as well. <comment357142> I have the same issue posted here https://community.wd.com/t/my-passport-not-mounting-on-macos-10-12/204273
