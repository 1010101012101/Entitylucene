Does software compilation continue even if I close the lid of my MacBook Pro (7,1)? <body> My specific case is that I am installing something from MacPorts and it's taking a very long time. I just want to close the lid of my laptop.  Will the compilation still continue?  I do not want to install the NoSleep app.  <answer111637> Generally, closing the lid will put your computer completely to sleep. Meaning any running processes will only continue once you wake the computer back up. There are very rare cases where this does not apply.   However, why must you close the lid? The way that MacBooks are designed, they're the best ventilated when the lid is open. If you close it, you can block the air outputs. You can operate your computer, or allow it to continue operating to finish a task, with the lid closed. But it isn't a good idea to do so if the task will be intensive in any way. And compiling is certainly intensive. Meaning you shouldn't close the lid when anything's compiling or installing from MacPorts.  So in short, no, software compiling will most likely not continue if you close the lid. And in addition, why would you need to? It's better not to as your computer will run cooler and last longer.  <answer174295> As mentioned before, closing the lid of a portable Mac causes it to sleep, emand not/em to dream of compilations as-yet unfinished.     What happens when I close the lid on my MacBook Pro running OS X?   If (and only if, apparently) your Mac is connected to:   ul lian external display,  /li lian external keyboard or mouse or trackpad/li lia power adapter,/li /ul  your laptop will operate in "clamshell mode", as outlined here:       http://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201834   and your compilation will continue.
