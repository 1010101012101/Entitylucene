Xcode 8.3.3: Unable to push to repo using ssh key <body> I have my github repo setup with ssh key to access it: pull/push.  With command-line git commands it does flawlessly.  But I can't push with Xcode.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yyHPx.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't have any passphrase with my private key.  Whenever I press [OK], I'm getting the same window again and again. No error or something.
