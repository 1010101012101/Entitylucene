Calendar event repeating every month but on a certain day <body> Is it possible to create a calendar event repeating every month but on a certain day?  For example our window cleaner started on a Friday and comes every month but on the Friday. Calendar obviously works it out to be a Sunday but it would have been the Friday 2 days prior to that.   Is it possible to do such a thing in Calendar?  <answer239193> Select the event. Go into repeat. Select Custom. Change your frequency to monthly and "on the" to whichever day you want.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pPW7X.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer239194> If you choose a monthly repeat and then choose "on the" you can choose the first Friday of the month for instance.  Is that what you needed?
