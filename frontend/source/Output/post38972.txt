What is pref path for Passcode Lock? <body> One thing I really miss from Android is creating home-screen shortcuts and toggles, well, for anything. With iPhone iOS5 there are a number of paths that let you create shortcuts to certain system settings like Wi-Fi, Brightness, etc. Is there one for Passcode Lock (I haven't found it)? (I want to enable one-click passcode locking, i.e. not have to navigate through General Settings). I'm not sure if there's a reason that the path isn't listed or if it's an oversight (in people linking to other people's content).
