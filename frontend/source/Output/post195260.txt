Make selected text in Notes the default style (no custom fonts, colors, bold, underline etc) <body> I'd like to be able to select some text in Notes and hit a key or something to make that selected text go "default". No bolds, italics, fonts, or big/small sizes. Is there any such feature?  <answer195273> Unfortunately there is no clear formatting option or shortcut, however you can copy and paste the formatting of selected text.  For example if you have a note open with normal formatting, even just opening a new note and typing hello, press kbdCommand/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdC/kbd to copy the default normal formatting, then select the note you want to clear and press kbdCommand/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdV/kbd to paste that formatting over the text (i.e. clear the formatting).  Also as a point of note, typically you only get these issues from copying and pasting from a formatted document. You can avoid this by using codePaste and Match Style/code which is kbdCommand/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdV/kbd  Hope that helps!
