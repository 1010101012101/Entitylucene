How to make Dock less sensitive <body> I am having a problem with the Dock popping up when I have my mouse near the bottom.  Before, the Dock would pop up when the mouse was at the very bottom.  But the current behavior makes it difficult to access things like tabs on a spreadsheet because the Dock comes up and covers them.  What is to be done?  <answer161909> Try following in Terminal to adjust the Dock behavior.  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.5 /code/pre  compliment that with codekillall Dock/code to make it active.  The number at the end is in seconds (delay) so choose what it suits you.  To return to original settings use  precodedefaults delete com.apple.Dock autohide-time-modifier /code/pre  <answer161911> My personal solution?  a) Put the dock on the side of the screen, not at the bottom. Screens are generally wider than they are tall, and documents are generally taller than they are wide. Screen real estate is much more precious at the bottom than at the sides.  b) Never let the dock hide. Having the dock hide is not useful, because the space it covers isn't really available for anything else, as you've noticed. A hidden dock entices you to put things in places on your screen that you cannot reach.  But that's just my opinion. Yours may vary, or course. But you did ask....
