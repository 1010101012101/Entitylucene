Does the Mac Pro 2008 display memory speeds accurately in System Information? <body> Can anyone confirm that when a Mac Pro 2008 has 800MHz FB-DIMMs installed it displays the Ram speed as 800Mhz in the System Information and not 667MHZ. I am running OS X Lion.  <answer42269> Verified that there was only PC2 - 5300 RAM installed, which is 667MHZ. So there was not any 800MHZ ram installed, so I can verify that 667MHZ was in fact accurate in this situation.
