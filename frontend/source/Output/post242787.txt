How to keep Chrome bookmarks in-sync with Safari <body> I use Chrome mostly and bookmark often. I would like these bookmarks automatically synched into Safari. Is this possible?s  <answer242833> You can use Xmarks to easily sync bookmarks between most desktop browsers, including Google Chrome and Safari.  iOS devices cannot directly sync their native Safari bookmarks with Xmarks, but if you set up Chrome and Safari on your Mac to sync with Xmarks, and turn on iCloud Safari syncing for both your Mac and your iOS device(s), then your iOS Safari bookmarks will be indirectly synced with the ones in Chrome on your Mac.  <answer254724> Don't even bother installing iCloud bookmarks extension for Chrome. It works terribly and will screw up your bookmarks. The only solution I found is to use Xmarks, but it's imperfect, and I often check if Apple updated their Chrome extension to fix their issues. Xmarks works, but deleting bookmarks from Chrome doesn't work if you also have iCloud bookmark sync enabled. They will just pop back up sometime later. You may not need iCloud bookmark sync, but if you have an iOS device you do. The only way to delete a bookmark is to do it from OSX/iOS. You may have to do this several times.   <answer260645> To clarify the previous answer.  strongKnown issues with Xmarks+Chrome+Safari/strong  I would like to add some remarks about Xmarks. The use of Xmarks for Safari and Chrome works mostly very well, but in some case, you can encounter conflicts issues.  strongContext/strong  If you enable Chrome bookmarks synchronisation and if Xmarks plugin is in automatic sync mode (default setting), some conflicts can appear:  ul liall your bookmarks folder will appear in double./li liOne will be empty, the other contains the bookmarks./li /ul  It can be boring to fix that kind of issue manually... Especially when you have a lot of bookmarks.   strongHack/Solution/strong  The only solution I have found is to:  ul liKeep using Google Chrome synchronisation (bookmarks, plug-in and whatever you want)./li liDisable the automatic mode of Xmarks plugin (both on Safari and Chrome). /li liThen, each time you add a bookmark into safari or chrome think to overwrite Xmarks server with "upload" (see Xmarks advanced settings) and then, download the new bookmarks via "download". (emthe image below is an Xmarks for Safari screenshot - You have almost the same panel in Chrome Xmarks plugin/em)./li /ul  strongConclusion/strong  Of course, that trick doesn't make your life easier and is impossible to use when you want to use Safari and Chrome in the same time (too many upload/download to do).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHvBV.jpg" alt="Xmarks for Safari screenshot"  <comment298751> This isn't possible. Just pick one browser, that would be my advice. <comment298755> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/153860/37413 <comment298756> Maybe try https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-bookmarks/fkepacicchenbjecpbpbclokcabebhah?hl=en <comment320404> Be advised that i will occasionally duplicate your bookmarks, if the chrome native sync is enable, with normally is and it's very useful to keep your chrome on Android linked with chrome on desktop. I gave up on marks because of this. You may pay the premium feature to sync android also. That may work <comment345274> Furthermore iCloud bookmarks extension only works for Windows OS and not if you want to use Chrome at macOS. <comment367708> Are those issues still present in the latest version? <comment367912> I have no idea, I have stopped using Safari, however, I presume it's still the case. <comment370669> I use BookMacster by Sheep Systems on my main Mac. I then turn on Google's sync and iCloud sync. Everything stays synced. All the time. Works flawlessly.
