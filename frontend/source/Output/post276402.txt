Charge Macbook Pro Faster via USB <body> I've been trying to see if I could charge my Macbook Pro 2016 via a USB power bank. By just using a USB to USB-c adapter, it charges but very slowly. The power bank has 2 usb ports. Would there be a way to wire up 2 USB ports to charge twice as fast for my Macbook Pro?
