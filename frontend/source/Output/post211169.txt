iTunes won't share my original music on other devices <body> When I signed into my guest account it seems to have recognised my purchased music but none of the original work that I have done.br I need the whole library to appear as it does in my my main account but for some reason it's only showing purchased music. Same on my iPhone.    I want to do some editing work in my guest account which has more space  on it than my main user.   <comment254892> "Guest account" on what? Basically, each user has their own iTunes library, so you'd need to copy it over... but we need to know what machine/OS you're running to give instructions.
