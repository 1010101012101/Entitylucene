View info about PNG files <body> I have a bunch of PNG files and I want to be able to:  ul litell their pixel size/li lipreview them/li litheir file size/li /ul  very quickly. Literally, right click and bang!   Any ideas?  What would also be handy would a way to tell their colors. So if I opened an image, it was easy to see that part of it was #4545AA for example.

Basically, you can set your finder view to show dimensions as well as file size (and the usual, modified date etc), and you can set the thumbnail size for some preview, and simply hit space to open larger previews using quicklook.  Hitting Option+i on any file can get you extended info in addition.  I'm not sure about your exact requirements for colours, but a combination of a quicklook preview with Color Picker running (built in app) should be one way of achieving this also.  <answer97790> The codefile/code command in the Terminal also gives you some information:  precode% file foo.png  foo.png: PNG image data, 612 x 792, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced /code/pre
