Can I charge a 4th gen iPod touch with the Galaxy tab's charger? <body> Can I charge a fourth generation iPod touch with Samsung Galaxy Tab's charger?  <answer12642> You can plug a standard Apple 30pin USB Charging cable into the Galaxy Tab charger and it will work fine.  Both the Apple and Samsung chargers deliver 5v output (although the Samsung one delivers a higher current).  It is perfectly safe to use.  <answer98505> NO I tried it, it didn't work.  <comment13241> no.. i meant the charger, not the USB connector <comment13242> ah I see.  I amended answer.
