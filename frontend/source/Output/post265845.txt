USB Keyboard on MAC: \ and < characters inverted <body> I have a strange behaviour with an USB keyoboard connected to a MacBook Pro laptop.  In the laptop the keys are correct, but with the external keyboard the \| keys is inverted with the &lt; key: how can I solve this issue?  Mac OS X version: macOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C67)  Thanks.  <answer265954> After a long research, I have found this article on the web:  How to reset the mac keyboard  I made as described in the post:  ol liDelete the file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist/li liDisconnect the keyboard/li liReconnect the keyboard/li liRestart the pc/li /ol  After doing these steps, the keyboard had to be recognized again, and it fixes the issue.  The correct keyboard for Italian is ISO (Eur).  <comment333371> I think this question has been answer earlier in these forums, but I can't find it.  My recollection is that Karabiner can fix the problem. <comment333382> No problem, my friend! The point is that is not simple to find similar question typing the symbols "\" or ""... If you manage to find the answer tell me! <comment333398> Do you have Karabiner Elements already installed by chance? <comment333399> Bear in mind that people with English layout keyboards with the same basic problem will be asking about different keys, such as backtick/grave.  You are using Spanish ISO, right? <comment333441> @TomGewecke Unfortunately I can't install Karabiner because, as reported in the official site, "macOS Sierra support status - Karabiner does not work on macOS Sierra at the moment." I'm using the Italian keyboard. <comment333468> I have found the solution, so I posted an answer for others users. <comment333471> Very interesting!  Normally I would expect a problem with that .plist to affect both internal and external keyboards.
