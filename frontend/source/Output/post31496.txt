How to create a simple keyboard macro with Automator? <body> How can I use the built in tool, Automator (rather than a 3rd party app), to create a simple keyboard macro?  For example, I want it to press kbdCmd-Shift Left/kbd, then kbdCmd-U/kbd, then kbdRight/kbd, etc.  I tried using the record feature to create this macro, but ran into several problems.  The first is that it's copying my mouse events after I press record and as I go into the application I want to run the macro on. For example, in this case I want to run it in Chrome. I ended up deleting the first few steps which involved launching chrome. The reason I deleted them is because I don't want it to be limited to a specific application, and I think that it just adds to the complexity if it tries activating an application. I want it to stick with running keyboard commands only.  The second problem is that I'm not sure how to initiate the keyboard macro. Do I save the recorded file? Where to? How do I invoke the macro once I am in Chrome? Is there a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to it?  <answer31500> If you don't want to use any third party apps you are really complicating your life. Although I think it's possible.  1) Open Automator and create a new Service. In your workflow you want to Run Applescript. In there you tell it to press the keys you want. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ow09u.png" alt="enter image description here"  Once you save it as a Service you can then set up a keyboard shortcut for it in System Preferences. It should automatically show up under the General group. Make sure it's enabled and give it a keyboard shortcut. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/igm0Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have gotten this to work by testing the Show history function kbdCmd-Y/kbd. Hopefully the above isn't too cryptic.  If you want to set global shortcuts and run scripts you might want to look at BetterTouchTool: http://blog.boastr.net/  <comment278935> I would recommend Keyboard Maestro, it does exactly that.
