Is there a Mac equivalent for window snapping? <body> In Windows, you can use the Win key + arrows to snap windows to half the screen.  Is there a OSX equivalent?   I found a program that does this called HyperDock.  It worked well, but it was just a trial version.  It has more features than I care about and costs to much (IMO).    Are there any other programs that are free or cheaper that do the same thing?  <answer159086> Depending on your technical inclination, you might want to try Spectacle, or install something like Mjolnir.  <answer159091> BetterTouchTool (blog.boastr.net) does just this. I find it very convenient to use with a trackpad: by tapping in different parts of the trackpad I can snap windows to the corresponding region of the screen, one of the most useful features of BetterTouchTool (but it has many many more, check it out!)  Edit: BetterTouchTool is no longer free  <comment187003> Spectacle is exactly what I am looking for and free! <comment220496> And it's open source! https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle <comment229908> Of course, when OS X El Capitan is released, you will have a window snapping feature builtin within Mission Control. <comment265700> Try using El Capitain's [split screen mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948) <comment278845> I liked better touch tool for the quick and easy snapping using the touchpad.  Until it became a paid application though.  I never used any other features so I did not see the value is paying.  Spectacle works fine, just w/o a touchpad option. <comment286898> The link for Mjolnir doesn't work. <comment286899> BetterTouchTool is a paid option now. You should probably edit your answer to include that. <comment287530> @xApple thanks for pointing that out, edited the answer to provide better links.
