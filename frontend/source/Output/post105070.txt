How to resize a photo in TextEdit? <body> When I add photos to TextEdit, they sometimes  appear too big, and I want to make them smaller.  How can I resize or modify photos in TextEdit?  <answer105076> strongTextEdit/strong has no emdirect/em image editing options.  You can, though, once you've added an image into the document, emdouble click/em it to open it with strongPreview/strong.   Through Preview you'll be able to perform some embasic/em image editing such as emsize adjustment/em (strongTools / Adjust Size/strong) or adding emfigures/em or text (strongView / Show Edit Toolbar/strong).  <answer160169> strongLike Thecafremo already said:/strong You can, once you've added an image into the document, double click it to open it with strongPreview/strong.  Through Preview you'll be able to perform some basic image editing such as size adjustment (strongTools / Adjust Size/strong).  strongMy addition:/strong Adjust "strongResolution/strong" to something larger, i.e. 300 dpi and make sure you stronguncheck/strong "resample image". Now save it (or quit preview: the image will be saved automatically) and the size will be adjusted right away in Text Edit!  <comment138165> If I change the size in Preview but don't change the resolution, then it is still the same size for me in TextEdit, as if TextEdit can only draw bitmaps at 72dpi. Is it possible to have a higher-resolution picture in TextEdit, as would be appropriate for printed output? <comment225575> What version of OS X? What version of Text Edit?
