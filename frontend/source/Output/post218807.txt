Yosemite: How can I diagnose problem where Chrome won't download anything <body> When I try to download anything in chrome, nothing happens (eg. saving an image with right click). When I try to download an extension, chrome says codeThis item is already being downloaded and added into Chrome./code I looked "under the hood" and the Download folder is correctly set. Downloads work in safari. This problem also persists in Chromium. I have tried several solutions to my problem, but I simply cannot download anything. I tried deleting my chrome profile, pasting a past solution into terminal, as well as completely deleting all chrome applications I could find and reinstalling. I thought this could be a cache problem and deleted the cache (codesudo rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/code) as well as my Google Library folder (coderm -rf ~/Library/Google/code). However, none of these attempts have affected my situation  What could be causing this issue? How do I diagnose this problem?  <answer219947> I updated my system software now everything works
