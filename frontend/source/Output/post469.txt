How can I change which application is launched when I press the play button on my remote? <body> My mac mini came with a remote control. When I press the play button, iTunes is launched. How can I change what happens when I press this button (e.g. launch a different program)?  <answer472> according to the writer : This seems to work with iTunes 8 and 9, although you'll need to redo the patch after upgrading.  Open a Terminal and type the following   precodecd /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS sudo mv iTunes iTunesX sudo curl http://www.cs.umd.edu/~dmonner/iTunes -O sudo chmod uog+x iTunes enter code here /code/pre  From http://www.cs.umd.edu/~dmonner/iTunes  precode#!/usr/bin/env python  import sys, os, subprocess  launch = True blocker = ""  apps = ["Spotify", "Songbird"]  ps = subprocess.Popen("/bin/ps -x", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)  for line in ps.stdout.read().split("\n"):     for app in apps:         if app in line:             launch = False             blocker = app  ps.stdout.close()  if launch :     os.spawnvp(os.P_WAIT, '/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunesX', sys.argv) else :     print "Not launching iTunes while %s is running." % blocker /code/pre  and you can read more here and here.  <answer922> Some tool like Remote Buddy might help here, but it's probably much more than you asked for.  <comment456> That's a pretty dirty hack. <comment457> It's probably related to a LaunchAgent. Maybe I can find which. <comment530> The MENU button of the remote is controlled by com.apple.RemoteUI, but I can't find the one controlling the Play button. <comment826> @zneak: would rebinding the menu button also wake up the computer from sleep mode like the play button does? <comment829> I really don't know. :/
