Format SSD and restore TM backup <body> My SSD stopped mounting by itself on boot. So I booted into Single User mode, ran code/sbin/mount/ -uw //code and codeexit/code and it got mounted and I could boot from the SSD. However, after booting all I see is the Guest user and not the admin user.   However, I have a TM backup and would like to simple erase the entire disk and restore. The issue is I can't erase the disk in Recovery Mode using Disk Utility as it does not get mounted automatically.  What would be the best approach?  <answer140302> Hold down the kbdCommand/kbd and kbdR/kbd keys at startup to start the computer from the Recovery system. The Recovery menu that appears includes the option to restore from a Time Machine backup.  ul liFirst: delete your SSD drive using Disk Utility. (Mac OS Extended (Journaled))/li liSecond: Choose for Backup from TimeMachine./li /ul  And now we wait...  emIt would be wise to connect your machine using an network cable instead of WiFi./em  <comment165391> How can you boot in Single User Mode? Isn't your SSD the bootdisk? <comment165394> @CousinCocaine it's quite common to have a system that boots enough to get to the prompt in single user mode yet still has severe issues on the OS and/or the user level... <comment165395> I did not know. But the first line made it confusing: "My SSD stopped mounting by itself on boot". The Single User Mode is on the same partition as the System and not on the Recovery partition, right?
