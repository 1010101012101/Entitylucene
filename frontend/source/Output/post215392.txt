Windows install from DVD or USB on El Captain <body> I am learning about Mac more and more every day but I got stuck on this problem - trying to install Windows 7 or newer on El Captain.  I've been trying to put the .iso file on the USB but BootCamp would not recognise it. Now I have a clean DVD but I have no option in BootCamp to choose the installer disc as in this post.  I tried to edit the info.plist file from the BootCamp package but when I wanted to put it back it would not let me. Turns out, the folder permissions are set only to read despite being the user with admin access. When I try to change the permission to write/read, I get this error.  I am starting to think I will never be able to run Windows on this Mac. It is mid-2010 27-inch with El Captain 10.11.1, any advice what the next step would be? I am deliberately trying to use the BootCamp and not VMware.

Thanks!
