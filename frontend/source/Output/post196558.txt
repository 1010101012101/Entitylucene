How do you get terminal to echo / print all key strokes? <body> Looking to see what the terminal gets when you press keystrokes such as alt+a or whatever.  I remember there was a really simple way to do this with a one line command and without installing any extra software, but I can't seem to find it again.   Any one know?  <answer196560> Found it   codesed -n l/code  Really useful for debugging problems with terminal programs that benefit from complex bindings like vim.  Or just use codecat/code or codesed/code  <comment234799> This just gets `sed` to echo its input, but doesn't execute any commands. You can get the same result with just running `cat`. <comment234801> This is under program/application control. It is on by default for most shell programs like bash and zsh. Are you using telnet or ssh? Some other program? <comment234802> @patrix I'm including this in the answer, or if you want to make your own answer I'll accept it. Thanks!
