When your 27" monitor was not displaying right earlier this year, what problem were you experiencing? <body> I read your response on this question External monitor stopped working after 10.9.2 update  My external 30" just started going crazy. The picture will get all jumbled until I drag a window over the whole screen.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TVcoW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If this is what you were experiencing, then I'll try switching over my drivers. If not, I have to figure out what's going on. Any ideas? I have a 2010 Macbook Pro 13" using Yosemite.  Thanks.  <comment181359> did you try lowering the resolution <comment181360> so, is that with DisplayPort 1.2 mode enabled or disabled - I just scared myself to death when enabling it killed the picture, disabling brought it back. Seems disabled is default [same dell 2713H, but Mac Pro 3,1, ATI HD 5770]
