How do I change shells (bash to ksh) on OS 10.9.1? <body> I need to brush up on ksh after an 8 year hiatus.  How can I run korn shell in my OS 10.9.1 terminal then switch back to bash when done with tutorials.  <answer118761> The easiest way is to just start Terminal as usual and type codeksh/code to start a Korn shell. If you want to open a new Terminal window for it, type kbdShift-Cmd-N/kbd and run codeksh/code from there.  Depending on how your code.profile/code looks like, you might need to change it as well to identify the shell it's running under and execute initialization commands accordingly.  <answer118935> If you want to change the shell that is used for new Terminal windows, run codechsh -s /bin/ksh/code to change the default login shell, or change the command that shells open with from Terminal's preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAyNZ.png" alt=""  <answer147289> From your users and group settings, control-click on your account for advanced options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z21lE.png" alt="enter image description here"
