Can 'Presentation Notes' in Keynote be Locked? <body> When a speakers private presentation notes are produced alongside a Keynote presentation, there does not appear to be an opportunity to protect them from editing and/or mistaken deletion. I maybe wrong because l am still learning the app, but how do I prevent errors in the notes area?  <comment368173> Do you mean to still allow editing of slides? <comment368183> No, I mean "locking" the notes in the same way as we lock elements in the presentation itself.
