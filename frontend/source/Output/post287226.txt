Can I pair 2 Bluetooth headsets to my iPad simultaneously? We watch tv on it when traveling <body> We own 2 pairs of the same headsets and wish to pair them simultaneously to watch tv on the iPad.  Only one at a time seems to work.  They have the same name which may be the issue, but I can't find an answer online.  Is it possible to send audio to two Bluetooth headsets simultaneously? If so, how?  <answer287227> iOS will only output sound to one device at a time, and that includes the internal speakers. So no, you can't pair multiple Bluetooth headsets and listen through both simultaneously.  Your only options would be to:  ol liEach use a single earpiece from the same headset./li liPurchase a Bluetooth splitter./li /ol  <comment362581> FYI earphone splitters work a treat, used them myself from time to time. <comment362662> @SteveChambers Agreed. I've used splitters for the kids on long car trips more times than I can remember.
