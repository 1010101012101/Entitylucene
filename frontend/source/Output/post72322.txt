How do I make TextEdit remember last Save As location in Mountain Lion? <body> First off, I have disabled iCloud as default location for Save As dialogs in TextEdit.app:  codedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSDocumentSaveNewDocumentsToCloud -bool false/code  … But still, I have one critical beef in TextEdit:  Save As… dialogs don't remember the stronglast location/strong where I saved a file! To the best of my knowledge, this used to be the case prior to (Mountain) Lion.  How can I restore this behavior?  hr  Example use case:  ol liOpen TextEdit./li liType something./li liHit code⌘W/code./li liSave As dialog appears; choose ~/Desktop./li liQuit and reopen TextEdit./li liRepeating steps 1–3 … it doesn't default to ~/Desktop! (It's always ~/Documents.)/li /ol  <answer81492> There is software that can track this folder and augment the standard behavior that you are seeing.  I find Default Folder to be the best of class, and you can try it for free and then decide if it's worth paying once you've had a chance to kick the tires a bit.  http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/  <comment84074> I couldn't reproduce it. I also tried disabling NSNavPanelExpandedStateForSaveMode and enabling iCloud document storage.
