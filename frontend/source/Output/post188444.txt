I believe it is caused by the newly added codegcc v5.1.0/code package.  Rolling back to codegcc v4.9.2/code solved the installation issue with codertorrent v0.9.4/code package. You can rollback to codegcc v4.9.2/code two different methods based on the current state of your homebrew installation.   strongMethod A/strong  If you have not performed codebrew cleanup/code after codebrew upgrade --all/code then you can simply switch to older version of gcc by running codebrew switch gcc 4.9.2/code. For further information read this answer.  strongMethod B/strong  Unfortunately if you have a habit of running codebrew cleanup/code after codebrew upgrade --all/code (like me ;-(), follow the steps mentioned below to install codegcc v4.9.2/code package.  precodebrew uninstall gcc brew tap homebrew/versions brew install gcc49 /code/pre  strongFinal Step/strong  Install rtorrent by running the below mentioned command in your teminal.  precodebrew install rtorrent /code/pre  <answer251746>    rtorrent is simply removed from Homebrew these days because it's too hard to get to build in El&nbsp;Capitan   Source: https://two-wrongs.com/rtorrent-missing-homebrew-os-x-10-11-el-capitan  <comment223021> The errors are in the log before the ld line <comment225569> The newest released version of rtorrent on brew is now functioning.
