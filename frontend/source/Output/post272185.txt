Chrome in MacOS is effected with some vulnerable invisible extensions/plugin <body> When using chrome browser, suddenly advertisements appears and sometimes, a new tab opens with some advertisements pages.  I removed all the extensions, log out from chrome and then reinstalled chrome browser. Still, same issue persists.  Reinstalling the browser also did not solve the problem. How can I solve this?  Thanks in advance!
