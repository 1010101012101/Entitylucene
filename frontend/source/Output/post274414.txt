Migrate a Time Machine backup in terminal <body> code/Volumes/Original_Time_Machine/code is no longer being backed up to, but contains old backups that I want to keep.  code/Volumes/New_Time_Machine_Archive/code is an empty partition  Both of these are on separate physical hard drives.  I was thinking of doing this in the terminal. Connect both physical hard drives, then:  precodecd /Volumes/Original_Time_Machine cp -rp * "/Volumes/New_Time_Machine_Archive" /code/pre  Would I be able to restore from this if I copy this way? Or is there another way I should do it?  <answer274462> As suggested to the answers and comments in this question, the code-p/code option will not work on a Mac. I tested code-rp/code and it will convert symbolic links to real files. That means when you use this your Time Machine backup will become significantly larger. Time Machine creates symbolic links for redundant files and therefore avoids copying duplicate files between the snapshots.  Hence, use  precodecp -a /code/pre  to preserve the symbolic links. This will be necessary if you plan on continuing to use the data for Time Machine backups. Alternatively, you could also use codersync/code using the code-K/code option to preserve symlinks, e.g.:  precodersync -ahvrK /code/pre  This Apple support document describes the procedure for migrating a backup from one drive to another (using Finder).  <comment345094> What is your goal? Continue using the files for Time Machine backup? Recover data from all snapshots? <comment345105> My goal is to transfer this data and have OS X recognize the drive I move it to as a time machine backup and not just a regular partition <comment345107> @KolobCanyon OK, I see. The title suggests it more or less. I suggest you edit your question to make it more obvious. My answer should do what you want. <comment345147> The man for `-a    Same as -pPR options. Preserves structure and attributes of            files but not directory structure.` ... Don't I want to preserve directory structure?
