My Desktop folder is missing from favorites menu and also from Finder Preferences. <body> My Desktop folder is missing from favorites menu and also from Finder Preferences. How do I restore to the favorites menu?  <answer281575> I'm assuming by your Favorites menu you mean in the Finder's Sidebar?  To rectify this:  ul liGo to Finder/li liSelect Finder  Preferences/li liClick on the Sidebar tab/li liMake sure the Desktop checkbox is ticked/li liExit Preferences/li /ul  If you mean that the option for your desktop isn't actually available in the above Preferences, try the following as a test:  ul liOpen a window in Finder/li liIn the Sidebar, click on your username/li liIn the list of folders, you should see the Desktop folder/li liNow drag the Desktop folder to your Favorites in the Sidebar/li /ul  Let me know how you go.  <comment354342> Thank you for your response. To clarify, yes my Desktop is missing from the preference menu. I'm sorry, but my user name is not in the sidebar. More help please!
