iBooks margins are too wide in landscape Scrolling View <body> As of iOS10, when I choose the Scrolling View option in iBooks and rotate my phone to be in landscape mode, an ePub e-book's margins become extra wide, making it difficult to read the text comfortably on my small phone screen (iBooks did not have this problem in iOS9, I believe).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JpLA.jpg" alt="Scrolling View, landscape mode"   emScrolling View, landscape mode/em  In comparison, here are how the margins look like when my phone is in portrait mode:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EvG8T.jpg" alt="Scrolling View, portrait mode"  emScrolling View, portrait mode/em  Is there any way to reduce the size of these margins to be closer to the margins seen in portrait mode?
