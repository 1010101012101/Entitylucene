iPad 2 certain emails received are gibberish <body> Why are some emails I send to others received in gibberish- containing dozens of extra characters? What settings can I change to prevent this?  <answer56355> Make sure you using all your providers default email settings  Is it only on new email ; or on forwarded ones as well?  <comment64657> What application(s) are your recipients using to read your emails? <comment64658> ... I'm assuming your using Apple Mail to send from your iPad as well.  Is this correct? <comment64668> Are all others receiving emails like this?  What operating system and email clients are these others using?
