export unix help page to txt with colors <body> So I'Ve got the handy codeexiftool/code with has its own man page when executing codeexiftool/code or codeexiftool --help/code. I want to export this man page to a .txt file which I would to by typing:  precodeexiftool &gt; file.txt /code/pre  This works but has some weird double characters so I piped that output through codecol/code:  precodeexiftool | col -b &gt; file.txt /code/pre  Now that those double characters are gone, I want to preserve the colors as well. How do I do that?  <comment354052> How do you want the colours preserving? txt is plain text, how should the colours be represented? <comment354061> Although the first file.txt is given that extension, I expect exiftool will have included the escape sequences (probably the "double characters") necessary to colourise the output as if it were to be displayed on Terminal or similar.  Did you want to preserve the colours by converting the output to a Rich Text, HTML, Word document, or similar? <comment354064> Thanks for all the responses. Yes I meant rtf. The goal is to convert it into a PDF. <comment354067> I suggest that you look through the perldoc documentation.
