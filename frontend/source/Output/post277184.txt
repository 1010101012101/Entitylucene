iTunes 12: Is there a way to increase album art size in the Album View <body> I remember in earlier versions of iTunes it was possible to increase the size of album artwork in the Album View via a slider - so, for example, I could have fewer albums with large cover art per row or more albums per row, but with tiny cover art.  However, I can't find this function anymore in iTunes 12. Does anyone know how to do this? :)
