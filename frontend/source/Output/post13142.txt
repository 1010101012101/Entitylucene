(See: http://blog.macsales.com/9394-macbook-pro-2011-12gb-and-16gb-memory-upgrades-benchmarked ) <comment13841> Mostly, 8GB SO-DIMMs are just ridiculously expensive (~$800) <comment32257> I can confirm that 1066 MHZ works without any problems with latest i7 2011. I didn't test if there are any performance issues, but at least it is stable.
