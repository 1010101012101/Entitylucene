1 key - 2 letters macbook pro 2016 and 2017 <body> I had a macbook pro 2016 and had problems with the key "b", which produced "bb" about 1/3 times I hit the key. After reparation and several months later, I had the same problem with the letter "n".   I now own a macbook pro 2017, and I feel I have the same problem with the key "m", but maybe with an occurence of 1/40, which make it much harder to demonstrate.  It's always the same zone on the keyboard, I was wondering if several people had the same problem ?  <comment370413> I had this once and a NVRAM reset cleared it completely for me: (a restart using cmnd - option - p - r  wait for 3 sets of startup chimes.) <comment372023> When I type using the 'n' key on the macbook pro 2016 15" with touch bar keyboard, it prints twice, sometimes it does not print, even the caps lock key misses the press the first time and needs to be pressed twice. The feeling on the keyboard keys is not uniform. Apple care had no clue about these problems. They asked me to dump the machine with them for at least 2 weeks and then they would do a hit and trial, if nothing works then they would replace the top. So much harassment for a $4500 machine, Apple is no more the same brand you could trust. They do not want to understand customer anymore
