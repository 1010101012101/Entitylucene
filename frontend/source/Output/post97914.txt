Bootcamp and wireless usb keyboard: How to boot with Mac os <body> I have a Mac mini. I installed windows 7 with bootcamp and now windows 7 is the default OS.  My problem is that it doens't seem to recognize my keypress during the boot (I have a logitech usb wireless keyboard/mouse)  I was wondering if I can achieve to start in Mac OS with this keyboard.  I know its enough to press option on boot to get the selection window. But i tried with ctrl, windows, shift, alt, alt+gr and none of them will prompt the selector.  Any ideas? (maybe a bootable usb?)  -EDIT-  I've heard of http://refit.sourceforge.net/doc/   but it doesn't seem to be possible to set it up from windows..  <answer97915> Boot into windows and use the Bootcanp control panel to set the next boot to be Mac OS X.   From http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639 :     strongStartup questionsbr   How do I choose which operating system will start up my Mac?/strongbr   After running Boot Camp Assistant and installing   Microsoft Windows and Boot Camp drivers, press and hold the Option   (Alt) key while you start up your Mac to switch between Microsoft   Windows and OS X.       Use the Startup Disk Control Panel in Windows or OS X Startup Disk   System Preferences to set the default operating system to use each   time the computer starts up.   Or you can get any old USB keyboard and hold the option key.   <comment114922> Depending upon [which model of Mac Mini](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3476) you have, it might recognize paired bluetooth keyboards during the EFI boot process - but I'll give a general answer since you didn't specify which hardware you have. <comment114926> I don't seem to have this control panel. I tried to download almost all the bootcamp utilities from here: And they all said that its not for my current version :S <comment114932> Assuming you have the latest BootCamp, the drivers download from OS X Side, so if you are missing that program, a physical keyboard may be needed to move forward with an incomplete BootCamp install.
