Applescript Service fails because of missing constraints <body> I wrote an Automator Service which executes a small applescript to set the volume and play a sound.  To activate the service, I copied it into code/Library/Services/code and did a codechmod +x/code. To register a keyboard shortcut for the service, I ran codedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{"HelloWorld" = "$@~1";}'/code where codeHelloWorld/code is the name of the service as seen in the Services menu and code$@~1/code my shortcut (which resolves to ⌘+⌥+⇧+1)  After a reboot I can see the service in the menu with the shortcut next to it. When I press the desired key combination, an alert pops telling me that the script encountered an error. There also appears an error in the log:      Detected missing constraints for .  It cannot be placed because there are not enough constraints to fully define the size and origin. Add the missing constraints, or set translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints=YES and constraints will be generated for you. If this view is laid out manually on macOS 10.12 and later, you may choose to not call [super layout] from your override. Set a breakpoint on DETECTED_MISSING_CONSTRAINTS to debug. This error will only be logged once.   This suggests an error with some view that is not initialized correctly, but I'm not using any views.  Here's the content of the Automator Workflow:  precodeon run      if (get output volume of (get volume settings)) &lt; 50 then         set volume output volume 50     end if      do shell script "afplay /Library/Application\ Support/HelloWorld/hello.mp3"      return end run /code/pre  <comment358320> I solved it. You can't escape spaces in `do shell script` arguments. I had to put the filename in double quotes (which you can escape).  The error message is massively misleading! <comment358337> It's perfectly acceptable to write an answer to your own question and is also preferred over placing it in a comment. You could then after the waiting period accept your own answer to boost your reputation.
