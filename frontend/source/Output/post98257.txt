Mac mini stops blinking in standby <body> I'm on Macmini6,2 with current firmware and 10.8.4. When I send it to sleep it starts its on and off fading status LED thing to indicate it is now asleep.  When I come back a few hours later, it is dark, but the computer is still asleep and enters wake mode when I touch any key.  What's wrong there? Isn't the indicator LED supposed to blink all the time?  <answer98489> I am not sure if it is only with the most recent model, but apparently by default it is set to go into deep sleep after a few hours, and this turns the power light off entirely.  This thread on AVForums provides a command that should disable deep sleep, if that is what you want.  precodepmset -g sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0 /code/pre  After entering this it will prompt you for your password.
