Traffic to IP addresses matching local network not sent over VPN <body> I have an active VPN connection (L2TP) and try to access a server with IP 192.168.1.29 in the remote network.  If my local network uses the same subnetwork (192.168.1.0/24), connections to that subnet are not routed through the VPN, so the connection to the remote server fails. If my local network uses a different subnetwork (e.g., 192.168.2.0/24) the connection succeeds.  Is there a way to access my server in the first case?  <answer220723> No. This is precisely why all of documentation about setting up VPN tunnels/bridges stresses the need for local and remote networks to have different subnets.  You will need to change one or the other.
