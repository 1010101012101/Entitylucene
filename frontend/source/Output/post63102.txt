Strange font weight in Google Chrome <body> I realised that on my 13" MacBook Pro (mid 2012), Google Chrome renders fonts with codeopacity/code in a different way than other browsers.  This is what it looks like in Chrome:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PlFq9.png" alt="Google Chrome on OS X"  Notice that the second heading is much thinner that the first one. This is the same code in Firefox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PVLcP.png" alt="Firefox on OS X"  In Firefox it's correct.  This looks very weird especially with fade in/out effects...   I have no idea what's wrong. When I had my old 15" MacBook Pro (late 2008) it was correct in all browser, so maybe it has something to do with rendering using GPU?  By the way, this is the test code http://jsfiddle.net/Ar23s/.  <comment72836> Did you test it outside JSFiddle? Chrome rendered them normally when I copied the code to a local HTML file. <comment72839> Yes, I made that JSFiddle just to make a small "demo" :). <comment72859> This is probably because Chrome renders its own window and doesnâ€™t use OS X default programming practices. Just a theory. <comment72884> Check this answer to another question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/15050/6838 <comment72983> I tried this but it unfortunately didn't help.
