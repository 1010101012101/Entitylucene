How can I replace Finder with Path Finder in OS X Lion? <body> I downloaded Path Finder and like it a lot, but Finder still takes over some functionality that I'd prefer Path Finder to do. For instance, if I open a folder on my desktop it opens in Finder, and when I mount disk images, they open in Finder. Is there a way (short of going in low-level and replacing Finder stuff with Path Finder stuff, which I don't really want to do) to make Path Finder do everything that Finder does by default?  <answer51332> According to the Path Finder Support Forums, it is not possible to completely replace Finder with Path Finder. For more information see "Can I replace OS X's Finder with Path Finder?"  <answer229754> These days (2016) Path Finder is much better integrated already from the start.
