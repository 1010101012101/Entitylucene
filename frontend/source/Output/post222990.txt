But unless you are really keen on running codeemacs/code in terminal mode, I would recommend to install Aquamacs instead which provides a much better integration with OS X. Also, codepackage/code is part of the standard installation.  <comment270280> Where/how did you install `package`? <comment270299> I don't install anything yet... on linux that code works without installing package. I think it comes with built-in.
