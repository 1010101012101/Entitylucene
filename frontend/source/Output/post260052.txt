Azerty layout with direct number input <body> I grew used to the azerty layout (which was a bad idea, but I don't have energy to spend months relearning to type).  I would really like however to have the numbers row behave as it does in the normal qwerty layout (number input on press rather than symbol).  This is less for typing purposes than for keyboards shortcuts relying on numbers, which depending from the app either force me to add an awkward shift press or just don't work at all.  Ideas?  <answer260059> French Numerical might help.br I found this article whilst Googling -      strongNumbers on the Belgian keyboard/strong      If you opted for the French or Belgian Apple wireless keyboard, you   may experience a strange behavior when using the number keys. On the   AZERTY keyboard, the numbers appear on the second top row of keys,   together with the accented and special characters.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3LL8a.png" alt="enter image description here"      Apple Wireless keyboard frHowever, it may be so that when pressing the   Caps Lock On, you still get the accented characters instead of the   expected numbers. This is a bit of a challenge when needing to enter   series of figures.      If so, you have to change the default keyboard in the system   preferences, to “Français – numérique” instead of “belge”. Go to   System Preferences, in the Language and Text section. Then in the   “input method”, select the “Français – numérique” keyboard, and   deselect the “Belge” keyboard. From now on, when Caps Lock is on, the   number keys will actually return numbers.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n5bmT.png" alt="enter image description here"   The Keyboard Control Panel has changed slightly since that article was written - it's now accessible on a separate sheet, after hitting the + at the bottom of the pref pane.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xs9D9.png" alt="enter image description here"
