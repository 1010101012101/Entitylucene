Where can I find unsaved Preview images? <body> I have two unsaved images open in Preview. My Mac is on strike, no screen usable, but SSH is working fine. I emreally/em want to salvage my images.   strongWhere can I find my images ?/strong  At worst, I would accept memory dump as an option.  <answer159173> Look at /Users/(your user)/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Autosave Information/ That's where mine are right now.  <comment186940> I have tried salvaging things with "osascript", to no avail. <comment188159> I do not have "~/Library/Containers". I have Mac OS X 10.6.8.
