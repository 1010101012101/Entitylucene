Trouble installing from Remote Disc <body> My MacBook has no optical drive. I have a Mac installation disc mounted and shared on a local Ubuntu machine and can access it, on the MacBook through the Remote Disc device in Finder.  However, the installation package and all sub-packages, have been stripped of the dot in their file names. Hence it is not recognised as an package.  Why is this and how can I install the software?  Thanks  (To share the disc I used openssh-server on Ubuntu and Macfusion on the Mac.)  <answer91610> How about:  ol liOn the Ubuntu machine, make a ZIP file of the installation package./li liCopy this file across to the Mac, using your existing sharing setup./li liExpand it on the Mac and run it./li /ol  strongEdit/strong The actual solution can be found in the comments below: use codesudo mkdir /media/test; sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/cdrom /media/test/code to mount the CD on the Ubuntu machine.  <comment107633> Thanks for the suggestion but when I tried this I noticed that the dots were missing on the Ubuntu side too! Could it be that this is some sort of anti-copying technique that prevents the disc from being used for anything other than a regular install? <comment107644> I doubt it's an anti-copying technique... more likely Ubuntu isn't reading it correctly.  I found a suggestion [here](http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1549169) to mount the CDROM on Ubuntu using (eg) `sudo mkdir /media/test; sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/cdrom /media/test` -- is that any help? <comment107921> Yes, manually mounting and specifying the filesystem type as per your comment, worked for me. Many thanks.
