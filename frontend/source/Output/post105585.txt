How to enable fast user switching when Login Options are disabled? <body> I'm not sure how this machine was setup, but I do have control over it now as a local admin.  I need to enable fast user switching, but the option is greyed out along with some others. This is after unlocking the changes padlock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNprZ.png" alt="Users and Groups"  Is there anything I can do to reenable these options?  <comment124152> Apple published some [OS X Security Configuration Guides](https://ssl.apple.com/support/security/guides/).  I can't find one for 10.8, but the one for 10.6 has a script (on page 253) that includes the comment "Disable fast user switching", followed by `sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences MultipleSessionEnabled -bool NO`.  Perhaps try that with `-bool YES`?  Oh: also, here is a [similar question with no answers](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70962/fast-user-switching-remains-disabled?rq=1).
