Can only run AppleScript from Automator <body> I have the following AppleScript which toggles the scroll direction on the trackpad:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.trackpad" end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         click radio button "Scroll &amp; Zoom" of tab group 1 of window "Trackpad"         click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window "Trackpad"     end tell end tell  tell application "System Preferences"     quit end tell /code/pre  This script runs without issues when the "play" button in Automator is used to execute it. However, when I make a service that runs it and assigned a keyboard shortcut to the service, it fails to run via the keyboard shortcut.  Wrapping it in a codetry/code block with some error reporting yields the following:     Automator Runner is not allowed assistive access.      Error number-1728   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SuYwR.png" alt="enter image description here"  I found Automator Runner.app and gave it assistive access using the instructions found here.  It now appears with a checked box in the list of applications with assistive access:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o4h0J.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, the issue persists. I continue to get the same message notifying me that codeAutomator Runner is not allowed assistive access./code when trying to run the script using the keyboard command of the service that runs the script.  hr  h2Update/h2  I just succeeded at implementing this alternative script to accomplish the same thing, but it also only works when Automator has focus and has the same issue when it does not:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "trackpadTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.trackpad" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  <answer144488> Not an answer, but...br To attempt to debug, I would deconstruct the script to its components, so roughly split to only   precodetell application "System Preferences" activate set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.trackpad" end tell /code/pre  &amp; test for any error  Then add   precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"          click radio button "Scroll &amp; Zoom" of tab group 1 of window "Trackpad"     end tell end tell /code/pre  check again  &amp; onward until you find the fail point  One possibility would be to reverse sys events &amp; sys prefs in your current running order, but that's just a shot in the dark.  Hopefully, someone with better applescript chops than I will provide a better solution.  <answer220559> I suspect you may not really have a problem that could be "debugged".br Read this strongGuide/strong from macosxautomation.com on how to have applets that don't permanently keep their "permission" to run, be accepted by Mac OS X.     Trick is to install a special strongemResourceRules-ignoring-Scripts.plist/em/strong that you sign and register your app(let) into. (But read the WARNING on this web page!)  Reason is, some apps save information "into themselves" and therefore won't be identical/ recognized next time they run.  em(But anyway: even if the Guide's advice does strongNOT help you/strong, it still might be of interest to others  ...)/em  <comment170181> 1728 is object not found, so maybe try simplifying until you identify the un-found object or access error. <comment170191> @Tetsujin Any guidance you can provide in how this is done would be much appreciated. <comment170192> to get some formatting, I'll have to do this as an 'answer' but it's still only 'troubleshooting' not a true solution... <comment170198> Thanks so much for your continued input! The first `tell` block runs without causing the error. It emerges when the System Events and System Preferences block is added in. <comment170204> It appears another user ran into a similar issue here which is as-yet unresolved: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/93567/system-preferences-applescript-using-osascript-cannot-select-its-window <comment222973> I don't have Automator listed there in Privacy tab so I can't enable it :/// Any ideas? <comment222974> Solved: I dragged Automator app to this window...
