Time Machine on Snow Leopard, Partitioning External Drive <body> Have bought an external drive for two purposes.  Its 2Tb. I wish to use it for time machine on a mac running snow leopard, however I wish to partition the space, e.g. have 1TB available for say dropbox to sync to and the other TB for time machine.  I'm not really seeing a way to accomplish this and have surfed around to no avail.  Any help welcomed!  Best, Frank  <comment347681> Look at the Disk Utility app
