Stop the iPhone from spreading photos over several folders within DCIM? <body> When I connect my iPhone 5S to my computer and browse it in Windows Explorer, the only folder that shows is DCIM, which I believe is expected behaviour - allowing only the photos on the phone to be grabbed from it. What I'm annoyed by is the weird way the iPhone separates the photos within the DCIM folder. At the moment, I have just over 440 pictures stored, and these are automatically spread between 5 different but incrementally named folders - em100APPLE/em, em101APPLE/em and so on until em105APPLE/em.  strongWhy exactly does the iPhone do this, and is there a way to force all photos on the phone to appear in a single, unified folder within DCIM?/strong  <comment328808> On macOS, apps that interact with the images stored on the iPhone do not show the DCIM folder structure that you see in Windows. There must be some sort of meta-organization of the images in iOS that uses DCIM folders for its own design unseen by mere humans. When you look at the photos using iTunes for Windows, do you see a DCIM folder structure?
