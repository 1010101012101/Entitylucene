Cyberduck replacement for SCP transfers <body> Since Cyberduck uses Java, it's out for me.  Any replacement for Mavericks that is good, has similar to WinSCP functionality and has an option to try before I buy?  <answer126330> I’ve heard only good things about Transmit.  <answer126425> Cyberduck 4.4 or later requires no Java installation.  <answer126430> It looks like Fugu does scp and even won an Apple Design Award for best use of open source (in 2003).   strongEdit:/strong  Downside: it is a PPC app, so doesn't work unless you are still on Snow Leopard.  <answer126439> Interarchy is a FTP client which provides many other protocol, including SCP and SFTP.  <answer139676> I can confirm cyberduck works fine in Yosemite, too.  Using Java downloaded from Oracle site.  Cyberduck DOES use SCP, i regularly use it.  Some problems seem arise on simple PFTP site (port 21) for timeouts.  <answer203159> Cyberduck does not support SCP (any more). See the closed ticket: ticket 8895. Try DCommander for SCP on Mac.  <answer203173> I switched to Filezilla which works splendid on both Mac and Windows.  https://filezilla-project.org  That was after I found out that the Mac OS X Filezilla client does SFTP on the same servers that also perform SCP.  (note to self: codeSFTP/code is not a different form of codeFTP/code, it is more like a better codeSCP/code)  After having used Filezilla for more than a year now, I would not ever switch back to Cyberduck.  <comment148003> Just because it uses Java? What's wrong with Java? Also, if you Google "mac ftp", you should find quite a few. <comment148038> I recommend Transmit too. <comment148070> The site says only ftp and sftp. Does it do SCP too? <comment148071> I don't want FTP. I want SCP. The last CyberDuck I tried to use wanted a too old version of Java (that Apple doesn't even ship any more), and I don't have enough confidence that Oracle knows how to keep Java up to date on a Mac (they hardly can on Windows). Embedded Java is out of the box: too much of a security risk. <comment148072> I get mixed results when trying to find out what the embedded run-time is based on. If it is Java, it is out too: minimizing attack vectors here. <comment148074> @JeroenWiertPluimers it can connect to  FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3, and WebDAV servers. <comment148075> Since it does not do SCP, it is out too (see the SCP tag in my question: it is mandatory for me). <comment148076> I'm guessing scp in the terminal is out too? <comment148078> @dwightk I use scp on the command-line now on SuSE and Mac OS, ESXi and Windows through Cygwin, but it is often too clumsy. Currently I'm investigating [Midnight Commander with SCP support](http://wiki.blue-panel.com/index.php/Midnight_Commander_(en)#SCP_Client:). BTW: Thanks for the edit. <comment148079> I figured after seeing you tell people you don't want ftp 3 times it was a good adjustment :D <comment148081> Yeah. ftp. been there done that in a previous life when you could trust the net. Been using SSH since the mid 90s last century (: <comment148083> Have you tried using the Finder's Go  Connect to Server dialogue with ssh:// ? <comment148084> Fugu hasn't been maintained for too long, but for the people that want to try: There is a fugu version 1.2.1pre1 beta of almost 3 years old that runs on Intel at  http://sourceforge.net/projects/fugussh/files/ <comment148085> Yes: `URLs with the type “ssh:” are not supported.`. <comment148086> Why do you think Java is a security risk here? Java in the browser yes, but Java for an application? Not significantly riskier than Objective C. <comment148088> @patrix go tell that to the places I work for (: Ideally I want a tool that uses the OpenSSL binaries and can be scrunitized. <comment148090> Hmm: there are "recent" `mc` universal binaries for Mac OS X at http://louise.hu/poet/tag/mc/ they are at 4.8.10 now, whereas the current cross platform version is at 4.8.12 http://www.midnight-commander.org/wiki <comment148091> https://trac.cyberduck.io/browser/tags/release-4-4-3/lib/1.7.0-u40-b30.jre/Contents/Home/release <comment148203> I'm going to try that one out. Thanks for the suggestion. <comment148205> @mtm thanks a lot. So the Java version they use is 1.7.0-u40-b30.jre from at least 9 months old. <comment148220> oh yeah, I used them way back when OSX first came out but switched to Transmit for some reason. Good to know they do SCP <comment149103> There is no "attack vector" in an embedded runtime. <comment164637> thanks for the update, but since it uses Java, it still is out for me. <comment224120> it does not do SCP.. Interarchy as Edouard mention is the best tools for SCP under OS X, I think. <comment310935> I'm using cyberduck 4.7.1 and don't see an option for SCP (I'm also hunting for a Mac SCP client and so far Interarchy appears to be the only advertising it).
