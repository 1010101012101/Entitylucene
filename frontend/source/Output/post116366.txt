Numbers: Grouping daily data into weekly data <body> I have a spreadsheet where I am keeping track of several statistics on a daily basis.  I have another spreadsheet where I am keeping track of several statistics on a weekly basis.  I want to graph the data together. In order to do this, I want to aggregate the first (daily) set of data into weekly data. This will enable to me to get it all on the same graph so I can better visualize it.  Suggestions?  --  Apple makes searching for help hard by calling their product "Numbers".   <answer117156> Figured this out, finally. Thanks, community!  I created a table with weekly dates. Then I added summary columns for the daily data:  precode=SUMIFS(   column_I_care_about_from_daily_spreadsheet,   date_field_in_daily_spreadsheet, "&gt;="&amp;date_in_this_spreadsheet,    date_field_in_daily_spreadsheet, "&lt;"&amp;date_in_this_spreadsheet ) /code/pre  I then added a "summary" column to match the weekly data  precode=SUMIF(   date_field_in_daily_spreadsheet,   "="&amp;$date_in_this_spreadsheet,   column_I_care_about_from_daily_spreadsheet ) /code/pre  Two things: - Yes, the second formula is overkill - Yes, SUMIF and SUMIFS reverse their fields from each other  From here, I could easily get a graph.
