El Capitan Mail Reply Question <body> At work I am using the latest version on Outlook for Windows and when I reply to an email it open right in the viewing window. Guess it is called "Reading Pane Compose." Is there a way to do that on a Mac? Currently when I reply, a new window opens up and then if I minimize Mail, that new windows gets buried and then I have to minimize other stuff or drag some windows around to find it again.
