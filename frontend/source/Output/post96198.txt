Uninstalled zsh, terminal gone weird <body> I uninstalled zsh pretty soon after I installed it as I realised I had got used to the normal Terminal. The uninstall went successfully and I restarted Terminal, but now it displays my computer-name (tommbp) with a % next to it, as display below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ex3KV.png" alt="Wierd Terminal message before cursor"  I'm not sure if this impacts on using Terminal but I'm not a Terminal superuser or anything so I'd rather just have it back how it was. Also, I am a front-end dev for a Rails app and when I went to restart the rails server, it says it's not installed and when I try to install it, nothing loads.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hFeM6.png" alt="Rails not installed"  Does anyone know how to fix these two issues?  <answer96200> Check your $PROMPT env variable:  precodeecho $PROMPT /code/pre  Can be set by editing your ~/.profile - there are lots of good tuts out there if you google for them.  <answer96208> How did you uninstall it? The title bars in the screenshots show that the current command is still codezsh/code, or maybe code/bin/zsh/code.  If you changed this setting in Terminal's preferences, change it back to the default login shell:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJTwh.png" alt=""  If you changed the default login shell, you can change it back to code/bin/bash/code with codechsh -s /bin/bash/code.  <comment112918> Thanks Geoff :) echo $PROMPT outputs as %m%# - I've tried to edit .profile but it doesn't work, and I tried editing .bashrc using nano but that didn't work either. Is this normal or am I missing a step? I just put PS1="\h:\W \u\$" (apparently the default for OS X) at the top of .profile and .bashrc. Is this correct? <comment112922> yeah found this solution literally just before you posted it. Thanks anyway :) Teaches me not to mess with Terminal when I'm not absolutely 100% sure what I'm doing :L
