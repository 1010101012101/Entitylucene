Something wrong with the root shell <body> Today, I've tried opening a root shell and, oh surprise, weird answer...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V7DNu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any idea of where it could be from ?  <answer88237> It seems you set up some sort of git info function to be included in your bash shell. This function now can not be found. Did you update your profile / shell?  <comment103253> It is from shell helpers tog it:) We ned a bit more information about how these were installed, there are several bash git completion setups, and shell prompts. However the key point is that they should not have been installed as root - look in /etc/profiles and similar
