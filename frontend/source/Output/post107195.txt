Fink help!! Not installing in Mavericks! <body> I just installed OS X Mavericks on my Mac.  Now I'm trying to install Fink via the instructions here  I have gone up to this line command:  precode./bootstrap /code/pre  But after that I am not able to run this line command:  precode/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh /code/pre  ... because there is no strongbin/strong directory under strongsw/strong.  Is it perhaps because of Mavericks (the instructions have not been updated for Mavericks because it is so new).  What can I do to fix it? (Paging Fink experts.)  <answer107207> You didn't specify the version of codefink/code you are using, but according to the Fink Announcement mailing list     Note: be advised that fink-0.35.2 does NOT work for OS 10.9.  If you are    testing on 10.9 prior to the official release date, you will want to    grab an archive from https://github.com/fink/fink/tree/Futureproof2   And in the Fink Beginners mailing list     We've added support for 10.9 into the master branch of the github    repository (https://github.com/fink/fink).  Folks that were using the    "Futureproof2" feature branch may want to update their git checkouts    appropriately to pick up changes that get made after the merge and    before we do a release.      Some other notes:      ol   liThere is no 10.9 support in any released fink, version 0.35.2 or    earlier.  (The first 10.9 support release version will probably be 0.36.0)/li   liThere is going to be no supported upgrade path from any earlier OS X.    The document /sw/share/doc/fink/INSTALL has information about how to    capture your list of installed packages./li   /ol   strongUpdate/strong  On October 31st, fink 0.36.0 was released which does support OS X 10.9.
