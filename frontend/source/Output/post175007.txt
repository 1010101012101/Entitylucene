Is there better third-party scanner software for OS X than Preview? <body> I'm not overly happy with the UI for interfacing with the scanner on my Epson WF-3250 series scanner that's provided by the latest Preview that comes with OS X 10.10. It's clunky and awkward, crashes often. You have to reselect your options every time you use.   It's just, honestly, not very Apple-like.  strongIs there reliable third party scanning software that I could use in place of Preview for obtaining PDF scans of multi-page documents on the Epson's auto-feeder?/strong  Edit: With OS X 10.9, Epson stopped shipping its own scanner utility. The ship a driver and instructions to use Preview for acquiring images on OS X.  <answer175028> You might try Paperless.  It retains the options across scans, and can do multi-page etc.  (And, relevant to the ADF):  ul liPaperless will display the Image Capture dialog./li liIf the ADF is supported by Image Capture, the dialog will display Feeder as an option to acquire with./li liChoosing Scan will cause all pages in the ADF to be scanned./li liAll scan jobs (multipage documents) scanned before choosing Done will be imported into Paperless as separate multipage documents./li /ul  Source  <answer175086> You may also want to look into the excellent VueScan. I haven't had a need for it in several years but back in the day it was really one of the best there is. Looks like it is still updated regularly.  <answer196064> PDFScanner from the app store is awesome. Very fast. Simple. Achieves small file sizes.
