Which delete is find using? <body> I ask because I was looking at the maintenance scripts OS X runs (/private/etc/periodic/daily/) and, for example, the one that cleans out old tmp files (110.clean-tmps) uses the following 2 lines to run the deletion:  precodefind -dx . -fstype local -type f $args -delete $print find -dx . -fstype local ! -name . -type d $dargs -delete $print /code/pre  There are both coderm/code and codesrm/code utilities in OS X, but how would I know which one codefind/code was using, or if it was using its own? (or if I could force it to use one or the other). Since the maintenance scripts cover things like tmp files, log files and the like, it seems a possible avenue for data leakage. I also occasionally see scripts using the codefind -delete/code option - how secure is it? codeman find/code told me nothing about it beyond its usage.  This may apply to other BSD's too (the scripts have comments about FreeBSD) but I'm not sure.   <comment301959> I'm not sure this is a security question. Migrating. <comment301961> Find uses the unlink system call and does not attempt to overwrite the file before deletion. <comment301986> @fd0: It seems to me that your comment provides exactly the information the OP is seeking.
