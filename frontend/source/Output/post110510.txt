How to cancel Mac store update? <body> Is it possible to cancel a paused app update? There is no cancel option in the App Store; only resume is there.  <answer110511> The secret is codeOPTION/code key. Press that and that coderesume/code button will turn in to codecancel/code.  http://www.cultofmac.com/224342/cancel-instead-of-pausing-your-mac-app-store-updates-os-x-tips/  <answer291015> I got the same problem, but I couldn't stop it using the option key. I just disconnected my Mac from the network and waited some seconds, and the download failed and it couldn't resume again. After that, I turned off automatic updates.  <comment222122> This no longer works in OS X 10.10.3 App Store 2.0 :/ <comment251010> works great on 10.10.5, went to launchpad and pressed the OPTION key and i was able to cancel the update for Xcode <comment363902> works in sierra (10.12.5)
