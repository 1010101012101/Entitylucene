How to use SSH keys and disable password authentication <body> I'm trying to access a Mac remotely (I do have physical access to this Mac) through SSH from a Linux client computer. My goal is to access this Mac from outside the network. Port forwarding is set up on the router. From my client computer I'm able to codessh user@ip/code for the public IP and I am able to get into the Mac, so port forwarding is working.  Now I want to set up SSH keys. I've generated SSH keys on my client computer but I wanted to get the SSH Daemon on the Mac setup first. I edited code/etc/ssh_config/code and set codePasswordAuthentication no/code. I restarted SSH with these commands: codesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist/code, then codesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist/code. When I try to SSH in from the client again, it still asks for my password.  I took a look at this post and from the answer I added codeUsePAM no/code to the config file and restarted the service with codelaunchctl/code again. I'm still being prompted for a password.  I also tried the solution here. I'm still being prompted for a password.  How do I set up my codessh_config/code to so that it doesn't ask for the password and only accepts SSH keys? Am I not restarting the daemon properly? Is there another step I am missing?  <answer225232> code/etc/ssh/ssh_config/code is the configuration file for the client which is used if you don't have a more specific one in your home directory. What you want to edit is code/etc/ssh/sshd_config/code which is the one for the server.  You will probably want to set codePermitRootLogin without-password/code (or codeno/code) and codePasswordAuthentication no/code there.   hr  Update: Since you are running Yosemite, the file is code/etc/sshd_config/code according to this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/167405/11135  To further elaborate why it still prompts when setting codePasswordAuthentication no/code in code/etc/ssh/ssh_config/code it is important to understand what you configured. "When making an emoutgoing/em connection via SSH, don't offer password authentication."   <answer225422> I was editing the wrong configuration file! Instead of code/etc/ssh_config/code, I edited codeprivate/etc/sshd_config/code. I think this probably would have also worked if I edited code/etc/sshd_config/code as per the updated answer from @GhostLyrics, but I didn't test that yet so I can't say for sure. After that, I restarted the service with codesudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd/code and then codesudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd/code and I was able to get my desired behavior. Here is the resource where I found the pertinent information: https://superuser.com/questions/364304/how-do-i-configure-ssh-on-os-x  Here are the config options I changed:  code PermitRootLogin no PasswordAuthentication no PermitEmptyPasswords no ChallengeResponseAuthentication no /code  After that I was successfully able to generate SSH keys on my client computer, moved the public key to code~/.ssh/authorized_keys/code on the Mac and set permissions for that file to 644.  It is important to note that those permissions are for my strongpublic key/strong. My strongprivate key/strong permissions are set to 600 on my client computer. This is emreally/em important if you have both your public and private key in your code~/.ssh/code folder and there are multiple users on the system. If your strongprivate key/strong permissions are set to 644 then emany/em user could read your private key and impersonate you. Also, the permissions for the code~/.ssh/code folder should be 700.  <comment273286> I don't have a `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, only a `/etc/ssh_config`. I'm running on Yosemite. I did try the `PasswordAuthentication no` but it's still prompting me for the password. <comment273291> Ah, I see. That is not what I want. I want to SSH from my Linux client to the Mac with keys and without a password. What should I change for an _incoming_ connection? <comment273292> `/etc/sshd_config` â†’ `PasswordAuthentication no`. Sorry for the confusion. Please let me know how I can make the answer more clear. :) <comment273293> I'm still getting the same behavior. It prompts me for a password when I ssh from the Linux machine to the Mac. <comment273294> Let's continue this in chat http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/34931/discussion-on-pubkey-only-ssh?tab=general <comment273315> Sorry to annoy you again, but when re-reading the chatlog, I found that you pasted the *client* file again, instead of the server configuration! http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/27140965#27140965 <comment285119> Internally, `/etc/sshd_config` and `/private/etc/sshd_config` are the same file. :)
