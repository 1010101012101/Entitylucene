How do I change the path that is being searched for launching an application? <body> I am trying to launch the D programming language compiler DMD, but the terminal is giving the following error:  precodedmd: failed to launch executable at /Library/Compilers/dmd2/osx/bin/dmd /code/pre  But there's not folder called codedmd2/code under code/Library/Compilers/code.   I can launch the dmd compiler from this path code/usr/bin/dmd/code, but I don't want to type this path every time I need to compile a source code file.   This is my code$PATH/code:     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/texbin   Is there a way that when I type codedmd/code it launches code/usr/bin/dmd/code, instead of trying to language a compiler under code/Library/Compilers/dmd2/osx/bin/dmd/code?  <answer175460> If code/usr/bin/dmd/code works and your path has code/usr/bin/code in it, and your path is exported, then you can just type codedmd/code. Otherwise you can change your path like this:  precodeecho "export PATH=\"/usr/bin:$PATH\"" &gt;&gt; .profile /code/pre  after which every new terminal will have the path you want. (this is the method used by homebrew, macports, etc)  <answer175461> To answer your question, your PATH has to be modified to:  precodePATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/texbin /code/pre  so that your shell will find     code/usr/bin/dmd/code before any other one called from within one of the 2 codePython/code library directories.  Please note: it is a dangerous practice to let any software not distributed by Apple to install anything within code/usr/bin/code (or code/bin/code, code/sbin/code or code/usr/sbin/code). This is a technic used by crapware to hide themself.  <answer176342> if the only thing you need to call is dmd, how about putting an alias in your ~/.profile?  add this to .profile:  precodealias dmd='/usr/bin/dmd' /code/pre  then open a new terminal, or type strongsource ~/.profile/strong to relaunch .profile.  You can also type the alias command directly in the terminal and test it out first.  But it will not be around next time unless you put it in ~/.profile.  I do this quite a bit.  Don't like to mess with the PATH for every single app that needs bash launches and it avoids stepping on something else by mistake.  Then you just type:   strongdmd ...your arguments.../strong  essentially, alias here does exactly what you don't want to do, it types out /usr/bin/dmd.  <comment206861> What's Your output of `echo $PATH`? <comment206864> How did you install dmd (and also note that it is not good to install into /usr/bin ) <comment206865> @MateuszSzlosek Edited my question. <comment206867> @Mark I think it was the default directory, or it was installed by another program or update.. I don't remember having explicitly set the installation path.. <comment206868> What does `type -p dmd` show? This is the dmd you are actually running <comment206869> re the install we do need to know where it was installed from so we can see the documentation <comment206870> @Mark It shows `/usr/local/bin/dmd`, yes <comment206871> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/21674/discussion-between-mark-and-rinzler). <comment206877> I know it would work, but it seems that it is first searching on another path, but it is not finding it... <comment206878> make sure your PATH is exported for it to work. <comment206884> My 2nd ยง is inspired from @Mark 1st comment :).
