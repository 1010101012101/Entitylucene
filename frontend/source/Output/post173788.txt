Is there a tool or scripting approach to change the arrangement of displays? <body> I move my monitors around a bit during the day. Specifically I rotate them or move my laptop to different positions. Each time I have to open up System Preferences  Displays  Arrangement and make the corresponding changes.  I'm looking for a tool or AppleScript approach for quickly setting a displays arrangement so I can quickly switch to proper arrangement.  Note I am not looking for a window management tool (plenty of those listed in What Window Management Options exist for OS X?).
