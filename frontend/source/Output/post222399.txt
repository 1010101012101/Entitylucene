Would this memory work on a MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011)? <body> Can anybody tell me if this module: Transcend 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L Unbuffered Non-ECC CL11 204-pin SO-DIMM would work on my MBP?   My memory specifications currently: 10 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 (1x8GB) + (1x2GB)  <answer222423> I don't know if the 1600 MHz memory would work in that machine, but you can get an 8 GB upgrade that's guaranteed to work in your Mac for less than the product you linked to (click 'View more compatible memory upgrades' to see the single 8 GB module).  <answer222430> No, your MacBookPro8,3 requires strong1333 MHz/strong DDR3 SO-DIMM. The module above states strong1600MHz/strong which is not correct.  This memory Kit should work in your MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011): 2x 8 GB 204 Pin DDR3-1333 SO-DIMM (1333Mhz, PC3-10600S, CL9)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lm0K4.jpg" alt=""  <comment269838> Will it not downstep the speed of the module? <comment269841> 2x 8GB memory would speed up your MacBook. <comment269844> Yep. I already have an 8GB and a 2GB, so I want to replace the 2GB module with an 8GB.
