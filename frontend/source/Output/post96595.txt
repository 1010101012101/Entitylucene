How to get Quick Look to print PDF files double-sided? <body> My default printer's default settings are to print double-sided. It works well in all apps, due to system-wide preferences… with the exception of Quick Look: when I open a file with Quick Look (pressing space bar in Finder), then ask it to print (Command-P), it does not open a dialog and send it directly to the printer, strongone-sided/strong.  How can I configure this behavior? Or is there another shortcut to get the behavior I want?  <answer96603> If you are on Mountain Lion when u use quick-look and press strongCommand-P/strong to print the document. The "emQuick-look App/em" actually opens the document in "emPreview App/em" and make a strongsimple print/strong. I advise you to open the document in preview directly to print it strongdouble-sided/strong.  <comment113409> Whats stopping you from double clicking and opening the file properly to print, is there a reason why it has to be printed through quick look?? <comment113477> @I'msuperawesome it's fewer keystrokes! (or mouse clicks)  Quick Look is already part of my workflow when I sift through files… not having to open it in Preview, then close Preview, is quite nice
