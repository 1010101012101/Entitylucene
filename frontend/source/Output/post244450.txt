Mac Pro acts as if no memory installed when upgraded (but only when new & old combined) <body> I bought a memory upgrade for the mac pro from crucial, http://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/mac-pro-%28late-2013%29/CT5019227  I installed it, by itself, it works fine, system boots and everything is perfect.  The existing memory also works fine, by itself.  As soon as I combine the two the machine refuses to start and beeps once, to indicate there is no memory installed - I've confirmed this by removing all modules and starting up, the beep frequency and tone is the same.  The new memory is 16gb modules, the old is 4gb.  I've placed the two upgraded sticks in slots 1&amp;2 and the old in 3&amp;4, in fact I've tried every combination available but still the same result.  If they mix they don't play nice.  Is there a way around this or is there a reason for it?  Thanks  <comment301251> Are the existing 4GB DIMMS Registered or Unregistered? You can't mix the two. Ref : https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205044 <comment301252> They'd be the ones that came with the machine.  I assumed that as crucial recommended these that they would be the same, whatever that may be.  Chances are you'e correct though. :(  Dammit, I'm gonna miss that 8GB! :D <comment301253> The Crucial page you linked to has a clear warning that *Installation of 16GB modules requires all previous lower density modules to be removed.* Was this not there when you made your purchase (in which case you might be able to return the RAM to Crucial for a refund) or did you just overlook it? <comment301254> @nekomatic, chances are I overlooked it.  I may have been little eager to buy new toys.  :D  It's no problem, now I know the reason I can stop it happening in the future and look for a solution. :)  Will try to sell of old ram and replace with a newer stick, the extra 8 would've been nice but it's not a necessity at the moment.  If someone wants to add the answer I'll happily accept it.
