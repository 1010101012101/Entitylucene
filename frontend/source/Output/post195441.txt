How to remove '/home' directory? <body> OS X 10.9.5.  I have a code/home/code directory in my filesystem. I want to remove it and create a symlink named code/home/code pointing to code/Users/code to make symlinks from GNU/Linux usable. But I cannot remove code/home/code directory (codermdir: home: Resource busy/code) nor create any file under code/home/code (codeOperation not supported/code).   Any solution?  Edit: As @thomasjones pointed, there's really something mounted at code/home/code. But what is that codemap auto_home/code?  precode$ df Filesystem    512-blocks      Used Available Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2   624470624 579889472  44069152    93% 72550182 5508644   93%   / devfs                371       371         0   100%      643       0  100%   /dev map -hosts             0         0         0   100%        0       0  100%   /net map auto_home          0         0         0   100%        0       0  100%   /home /code/pre  <answer195444> Open the following files with read/write permissions:  precode/etc/auto_home /etc/auto_master /code/pre  These files are part of the autofs installation.   In the codeauto_home/code file, add a # before the + on the following line:     +auto_home # Use directory service   In the codeauto_master/code file, add a # before the /home on the following line:     /home          auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder   Save both files, and reboot your computer. code/home/code should be free to work with.   To reverse the changes, undo what you've done to both codeauto_master/code and codeauto_home/code.  <answer195693> Here's some additional info on that. https://ssl.apple.com/business/docs/Autofs.pdf  <comment233295> Are you sure that /home isn't a partition? <comment233301> @ThomasJones `map auto_home` is mounted at `/home`. But what is `map auto_home`? <comment233314> It's a directory services NFS mount for reasons I don't know. <comment233674> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
