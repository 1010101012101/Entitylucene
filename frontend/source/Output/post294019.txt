Internal Speakers not showing in Output of Sound application <body> As shown in the screenshot only the Headphones are selectable:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rD4e0.png" alt="enter image description here"  But no headset is plugged in.  I have plugged and unplugged the headset several times to see whether the Mac thinks it were plugged in and maybe to get un-confused: no difference.  While I could try to reboot it would be helpful to understand if there were some mechanism to reset macOS "understanding" of the headset in/out.  <answer294096> h2Explanation/h2  If the sound output device is always displayed as 'Headphones' there are usually three explanations for it:  ul liyou have headphones plugged in/li lithe tip of a broken headphone jack still sits in the Mac's audio jack/li lithe Mac's audio jack is defective/broken/li /ul  hr  h2Possible solution/h2  Please strongcheck with a flashlight/strong whether you can see any debris in the audio jack. If debris/dust builds up it may trigger the electrical contact that makes your Mac switch from Internal Speakers to headphones.  Try to gently blow it out or pick it with a tweezer.
