How do I remove file access for unknown user (as reported by Finder's File Info)? <body> File Info, under Sharing &amp; Permissions, says "You have custom access" and lists:  precodeName          Privilege joe (user)    Read &amp; Write staff (group) Read &amp; Write everyone      Read only /code/pre  But codels -le/code says:  precode-rwxrwxr-x  1 egbert  staff  22806528 Jun  4 08:57 somefile.ext /code/pre  This agrees with output from codestat -x somefile.ext/code  precodeMode: (0775/-rwxrwxr-x) Uid: (  501/ egbert)  Gid: (   20/   staff) /code/pre  joe is not a known user on this system (check with codedscl . -list /Users UniqueID/code and "joe" is not in the list)  Finder won't let me "Choose new owner...". It says "The operation can't be completed because you donâ€™t have the necessary permission." Yet I am egbert (see above) and I am owner and I have write privileges.  There does not appear to be any ACL on the file or any extended attributes (@ or +). codesudo chmod -N somefile.ext/code fails with codechmod: Failed to clear ACL on file somefile.ext: Operation not supported./code  So who is joe if he's not known or listed among users? And how do I remove this user's access and restore privileges to me (egbert)? And why is there a disagreement between the Finder and what is reported by codels/code and codestat/code?

And sometimes file permissions will carry over between computers and if your computer is accessed over the network
