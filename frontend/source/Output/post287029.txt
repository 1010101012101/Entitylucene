How to log all files that have been opened? <body> I'm wondering if anyone knows how to log all files that I open with my Mac. I suppose this would be something like a keylogger - but I just want a record of the files that I open by day. I don't want/need every system file that an app references, just the data files - .doc, .psd, .ai, etc....  I struggle with keeping track of my hours sometimes on projects and it would be helpful to be able to go back to a day to see what files I was working on.  Anyone have any ideas?  <answer287138> No a keylogger will only perform a logging of the key you type on your keyboard.  To log all files you codeopen/code you need a kernel trace function, which will report every codeopen/code system call. This function is provided by the command codedtrace/code on MacOS X.  The command codeopensnoop/code is a shell script based on codedtrace/code and performing exactly what you are looking for.  I advise you to start by using it in its basic mode:  precode/usr/bin/sudo opensnoop /code/pre  And then refine it with the use of codegrep/code to eliminate file you are not interested in surveying:  precode/usr/bin/sudo opensnoop | grep -v /System /code/pre
