Right-click, create a new text file. How? <body> In Finder  Select a folder  Right click, we get a popup with an option to create a new folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OQZaJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to add menu item codeNew Textfile/code for adding a new text file?  <answer94847> You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Finder"     value of attribute "AXFocusedWindow" is scroll area 1 end tell tell application "Finder"     if result is true or number of windows is 0 then         set t to desktop     else         set t to target of Finder window 1     end if     set f to make new file at t     if t is desktop then         set selection to f     else         select f     end if end tell /code/pre  There is a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 that affects many other scripts and Automator services like this. Finder ignores new windows when getting the codeinsertion location/code and codeselection/code properties. If you open a new Finder window, select some items in it, and run codetell app "Finder" to selection/code in AppleScript Editor, the result is the items selected in some window behind the frontmost window (or an empty list). One workaround is to move focus to another application and back, but it results in a visual glitch.  So neither of these ways of checking if the desktop is selected work reliably:  precodetell application "Finder"     insertion location as alias is desktop as alias     container of item 1 of (get selection) as alias is desktop as alias end tell /code/pre  You could also wrap the script as an Automator service, but there is another bug where the shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar. If the input type was set to no input, the service wouldn't show up in context menus. If it was set to folders or files, you'd have to always secondary-click some folder or file.  Related questions:  ul liCreate new file from contextual menu/li liNew File Action in Finder/li liHow to create a text file in a folder/li liHow do I create files in Finder without Terminal?/li /ul  I didn't vote to close this question, because many of the solutions in the other questions are affected by either of the two bugs mentioned above. We'll likely get even more questions like this, which could then be closed as duplicates of this question.  <answer114396> emEdit: I couldn't get the above working as a Service but then I found a dialog hiding behind everything else where Finder was asking for permission to use the accessibility features. Once I'd enabled that the answer from Lauri Ranta worked. But the one below works well and doesn't need extra permissions./em  I've tried several ways, the cleanest I've found is the Automator script provided here:  http://oscargodson.com/posts/new-file-in-right-click-context-menu-for-mac.html  And available from Github here:  https://github.com/OscarGodson/New-File  <answer114409> There is a little known feature of the Finder called emStationary Pad/em.  Imagine having a pad of paper that you could "tear off" a new sheet from on your desktop.  Each page in the pad could have a custom layout and pre-existing content etc, allow you to (for example) fill in a "while you were out, X called" memo.  I'm not as a Mac at present to get screenshots etc, but if you open up a text document, and then enter the details you want to be used as your template (bearing in mind a totally blank sheet is a perfectly valid template), then save it somewhere, right click and codeGet Info/code, then click the codeStationary Pad/code tick box, then that file will subsequently behave differently from a normal file.  Double clicking to open the file will actually open a copy of the file, emwithout any filename set, as if it were a totally new document/em, allowing you to fill it in and save it with a name/location of your choosing.  The great thing about this is that without unticking the stationary pad option, you cannot accidentally overwrite or otherwise modify the original template.  There is more info if you google, this is a brief summary with helpful commens that isn't too old.  This isn't emquite/em right clicking on the desktop and clicking "New File", but if your template icon is on the desktop it's arguably faster (depending on if you are faster at locating an icon and double clicking, or using any white space, right clicking then choosing from a context sensitive menu...)  Alternatively, you could use a combination of one of the scripted methods shown in other answers to get them to simply open a Stationary pad file, and you can recreate the "create blank" feature nicely from any App, even ones that don't support Applescript, and the "blank" document doesn't even have to be blank,  but can be a template.  <answer124999> I am using XtraFinder plugin for Mac OS's built in Finder. It has most of the features including create new file in finder options.  You'll love it like I do  ;)  <answer245533> Try this guys method. Build the workflow yourself.br https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE_V0vzNTWQ&amp;list=WL&amp;index=7  <answer254593> If you download and install BetterTouchTool you can set up this action easily; it's one of the built-in available triggers.  Better yet, you can set it up for any keyboard shortcut emor trackpad gesture/em you like.  (Including a lot of trackpad gestures you didn't know existed.)  (I'm not affiliated with BTT in any way, but I do feel that a lot more Mac users should be using it.  It is the first application I install on any new Mac and I've been using it for over five years.)  <answer258558> There is a new APP in the store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/new-file-menu/id1064959555?ls=1&amp;mt=12     New File Menu allows you to create new files quickly via the Finder context menu.    ul liIf you upgraded to macOS Sierra, you may need to reinstall New File Menu.New File Menu is simply the coolest way to create a new file on the Mac OS X platform, you can right click in any Finder window to create a new file! You can even right click on the desktop to create your files!/li /ul  Important: New File Menu is implemented as a Finder extension, you need to enable "New File Menu Extension" in "System Preferences » Extensions" to make the context menu appear.  <answer286185> If you use Alfred, you can try this workflow. http://www.packal.org/workflow/create-new-file-finder-file-type-templates  Then you can type "new" in Alfred to create a new file in the current folder.  <comment111077> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12183967/creating-an-automator-service-to-create-a-new-document-in-the-current-directory <comment138068> This works great. <comment138069> At first glance, this doesn't work on Mavricks, does it? <comment143559> Trying this on Mavericks, it doesn't work quite as advertised in this answer. It copies the file and *opens* that new copy right away, not bringing up an option to choose the file name before you start editing it. (and indeed, opening it which you may not want if you just want to create and name the new file.) <comment143650> As per "Double clicking to open the file will actually open a copy of the file, without any filename set, as if it were a totally new document, allowing you to fill it in and save it with a name/location of your choosing." perhaps my wording isn't great, I'm not suggesting you get the chance to select the filename at this point, by fill in I mean't "write stuff in your document or fill in your template etc".  Hope this clear things up. <comment144305> This works. The instructions say to open it and hit cmd + s but that did nothing for me. I'm on Mavericks and when opening it, I was prompted to either install or open. I had choose to install it in order for it to work. <comment144354> This is interesting to know! However for me, I need to be able to create a new text file anywhere, rarely on the Desktop :) <comment205467> Nice app! Didn't know it, it has a tons of extra features! Thanks for the suggestion! <comment205654> you're welcome! <comment246988> Ace, add your own file templates <comment248198> Dude. Thanks so much for introducing me to that app. Amazing. <comment248212> You are welcome :) <comment275206> Good idea, but he only problem with XtraFinder is the System Integrity Protection after El Captain. You need to partial disable the SIP. Please read this url http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/sip.html <comment275808> this is so dumb its not default <comment302738> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.  Ideally, you want to explain why your answer is *right."  It also helps to provide links, citations, and/or screen shots.  Please review our help section [How to Answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) on writing good answers to questions <comment316955> A better idea is to use [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net), which doesn't require SIP to be disabled—it uses the Accessibility API.  AND it has a "create new file in current folder" option as one of the countless actions you can trigger. <comment316956> Stack Exchange links are the only links we trust not to "rot" on this site.  And even then, you don't provide *only* a link. <comment348673> Interesting. Can you give more details how this is done? <comment348742> @n1000, I don't have time currently.  It's extremely simple; I guess I could add some screenshots, though. <comment356240> one of the dumbest things about mac, its 2017!! and still no feature out the box <comment367917> Costs $2, you're paying $2 for a new file button. You're not in Kansas anymore <comment371159> OMG... I thought I'm retarded. Another favourite one - I download a new app - move to `Applications` folder and then `CMD + space` - brand new machine, still not indexed, I need to navigate manually...  Is it just me?
