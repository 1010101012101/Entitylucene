Install XPDF in Mac/OS <body> How we can install XPDF via Mac Ports? Or if another methods for the installation of XPDF in the Mac/OS platform exists?  <answer171005> That might look too easy an answer :):  precode/usr/bin/sudo port install xpdf /code/pre  <answer171012> You can install it using homebrew too.  First you need to tap codehomebrew/x11/code:  precode$ brew tap homebrew/x11 /code/pre  Then you can easily install it with:  precode$ brew install xpdf /code/pre  <answer235673> codexpdf/code is available through the Homebrew project.

Please add it, and by the way, please add the output of `echo ${PATH}`. <comment288265> From a comment you have installed xpdf so the question is not correct <comment288266> How does this improve on or differ from http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/171012/237 <comment288274> @mark: the question is clear enough and the answers are spot on. The fact that the question doesn't correspond to the problem the OP is facing is of no concern here :-)
