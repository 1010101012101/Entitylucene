Relaunch Finder link missing <body> I recently needed to show hidden files in my iMac 2011 and had to relaunch Finder to do so. Every tutorial I saw, said to kbdctrl/kbd+click on the Finder icon and then click "relaunch". The trouble is: I don't have this link.  In the end I went to the Apple menu in the top left, and Force quit Finder, which had the same effect.  Does anybody else not have the relaunch button? Is there a problem with my Mac?   <answer77128> The relaunch option is at the bottom of the pop-up menu you get when you kbdalt/kbd right-click (or kbdControl/kbd +kbdalt/kbd left click) the Finder icon in the Dock.  <comment89434> Sorry I've just tried that and Cmd-click only opens a new window. I think you need to ctrl+click to get the pop up menu. I do get a popup menu but no "relaunch" link. I tried to post a picture to show you the problem, but I don't have enough rep unfortunately. <comment89436> I edited the answer, but you have to alt + ctrl left click or alt right click to display "Relaunch". I verified this in OSX 10.8. <comment89440> Thanks for the edit. I had the alt/opt key pressed while trying it but didn't realize it at the time. So much for muscle memory.
