stuck with wrong account in app store on my new mac <body> I just got a new Mac, and everything went fine (I've owned like 6 different macs in my lifetime.) At one point however, I simply wanted to update my XCode app.. so I opened the App Store and clicked on updates, clicked on the update button, but the App Store is requiring me to sign in, but it's asking me to sign in with a different email address (ok I remember I once used a laptop of a coworker a couple of jobs ago and I had to do some updates. I have no idea how this is linked to my laptop now.)  Anyways, I have no idea how to change the apple ID here!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yxoh0.png" alt="enter image description here"  To make things even weirder, if I go to Store menu button, it actually shows my proper account:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N5cb9.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I'm left really confused now.. any ideas?  <comment191633> I'm going to add this as a comment since I'm not sure, but this means your co worker downloaded Xcode. I think deleting and reinstalling from your account will work.
