Identity not found when trying to code-sign an application with a certificate <body> After properly creating a valid certificate for code signing, when running the command:  precode$ codesign -s CertificateName AppPathName /code/pre  I always get a:  precodeCertificateName: no identity found /code/pre  Anyways, When I open the Keychain Access I see that certificate created in the System folder (with a + circle over it).  Also, when I run:  precode$ security find-identity -p codesigning ~/Library/Keychains/System.keychain /code/pre  The result is:  precodePolicy: Code Signing   Matching identities      0 identities found    Valid identities only      0 valid identities found /code/pre  What does this mean?  My console does not have access to the keychain? I also tried everything with sudo.  (I use zsh Terminal if that is important)  EDIT:  I've also found out that the System Keychain is locked, but unlocking it won't work and after performing a codesign action it goes back to "locked" again.  <answer196301> This is not the explanation of the problem but the way I worked around to solve it:  ul liDeleted the previously created certificates./li liUnlocked the System keychain with the keychain Access tool (locker on the left)./li liRecreated the certificates filling most of the fields of information even if not totally required./li liSwitched to a simple and clean terminal (just in case a modified terminal lacked some kind of access to the keychain)/li liExecuted the codesigning commands with sudo/li /ul  This worked for me, but I don't really understand what was causing the problem previously.
