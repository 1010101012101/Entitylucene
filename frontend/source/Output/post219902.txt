Partition map rebuild <body> I have an external hdd that doesn't mount anymore. I think I screw up with all the research I done and things I try. I have vital info on this hdd and I'm really afraid to lose it.  I tried this: Rebuild partition table on external HDD - not writable but run into a problem:  precodesudo pdisk /dev/rdisk1 pdisk: No valid block 1 on '/dev/rdisk2' Edit /dev/rdisk2 - Command (? for help): /code/pre  I tried a scan with Disk Drill and it seems that the data is there but after I tried to recover a few files, I can't open them. They have the size but I can't open them.  I tried repairdisk:  precodediskutil repairdisk /dev/disk2 Repairing the partition map might erase disk2s1, proceed?

It may be as little as $500 depending on the damage. Some places will give you an estimate for free. You can ask around on the HDD Guru forum for a recovery service in your area.  If you still want to do this yourself and aren't concerned about losing your data, I would attempt recover as many sectors as possible with codeddrescue/code and write it to an image file. i.e.  precodesudo ddrescue /dev/diskXsX /path/to/disk_image /path/to/log_file /code/pre  You can get codeddrescue/code with MacPorts or a similar package manager. Keep in mind that depending on the damage done to your disk, the longer you attempt to read from it with something like codeddrescue/code, the more damage your disk may incur.  After you've recovered as much data as you can with codeddrescue/code then attempt to fix the filesystem on the recovered image or scrape it for files.  <answer219960> The disk lost its GUID partition table and the EFI volume was partly overwritten. The disk was mounted in an enclosure which doesn't properly report a logical block size of 512 bytes. Instead 4096 bytes are used. The disk itself has a physical block size of 4096 bytes.  After trying some known but actually unsuccessful methods (e.g. Disk Warrior or answers here at stackexchange: HFS+ invalid number of allocation blocks to recover the disk, we formatted an equally sized disk, codedded/code the EFI volume to a temporary file and recovered the partition table (including the main volume) by using the same standard values we got by formatting the empty disk.  The EFI of the previously partitioned (empty) disk was saved to a file with:  precodediskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2 dd if=/dev/disk2s1 of=/Users/user/Desktop/disk2s1.raw /code/pre  strongRepairing the corrupted disk:/strong  The partly "repaired" but corrupted GUID partition table originally looked like this  precodesudo gpt -r show disk2      start        size  index  contents         0           1         PMBR         1           1         Pri GPT header         2           4         Pri GPT table         6          34                40      409600    1    GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B    409640   243781000         244190640           4         Sec GPT table 244190644           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  After removing the EFI partition with:  precodesudo gpt remove -i 1 /dev/disk2 /code/pre  and rewriting the GUID partition table with  precodesudo gpt destroy /dev/disk2 sudo gpt create /dev/disk2 /code/pre  the EFI volume and the main volumes were added with:  precodesudo gpt add -b 6 -i 1 -s 76800 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk2 sudo dd if=/Users/user/Desktop/disk2s1.raw of=/dev/disk2s1 sudo gpt add -b 76806 -i 2 -s 244081066 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk2 /code/pre  The disk and the main volume were verified:  precodediskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk2 diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk2s2 /code/pre  Finally the disk looks like this:  precodesudo gpt -r show disk2      start        size  index  contents         0           1         PMBR         1           1         Pri GPT header         2           4         Pri GPT table         6       76800      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B     76806   244081066      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 244157872       32768 244190640           4         Sec  GPT  table 244190644           1         Sec  GPT header /code/pre  All data was recovered.  <comment267845> I have a disk with similar issues, but I do not understand where you get the volume value 48465300-0000-11AA - AA11-00306543ECAC <comment267981> @Gush Please ask a separate (new) question instead of editing deleted non-answering answers!
