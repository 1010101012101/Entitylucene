Applescript to hide print queue <body> Running a Processing sketch which saves .txt files to a folder. Have a folder action attached that prints new files in this folder to a thermal receipt printer.   However, I had to update to Yosemite, and since then the print queue window opens up over the sketch and has to be closed manually before continuing with the sketch. When I print a document normally the printer proxy behaves and stays in the dock, and doesn't change focus from Processing.  I have no Applescript experience, but I think I need a script that I could include in the folder action, so these .txt files print automatically, without intervention while Processing is running.  <answer188932> One idea that comes to mind is to use the command line tools to print the files. If the files are sent to the printer without any pre-processing - in other words raw - then the following command should do it...  codelp  somefile.txt/code - if your printer is the default  or  codelp -d MyPrinter somefile.txt/code - for non-default printer  Use codelpstat -a/code to get a list of printers and their Unix names.  From applescript you would have to do it this way...  precodeset pFile to POSIX path of txtFile do shell script "lp " &amp; quoted form of pFile /code/pre
