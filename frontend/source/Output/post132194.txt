Weather app shows animation on one iPhone 4 but not another <body> My husband and I have identical iPhone 4's.  His shows animations on the weather app, like lightening, rain, moving clouds.  Mine doesn't.  How come?  Our phones are exactly the same phones.  <answer132220> The "Reduce Motion" setting in accessibility controls the movement in Weather.  <comment155382> how identical are they? same iOS? <comment155417> Could you post a screenshot?
