Send email from my ipad without receiving? <body> Is this possible?  I went into settings and turned off "fetch new data", but if I send a message from an account, the durn thing still downloads all my mail in that account.  I don't want it to do that.  In other words, I want the email on my iPad to be write only.  <answer35069> I don’t think there’s an officially endorsed routine for this, but I’m sure it’s possible; it just depends on what sort of email account it is.  What follows is guesswork based upon poking around the Settings panel of my iPhone. I haven’t tried these methods, but these are what I think might work.  hr  h2iCloud/h2  First you need to disable the default iCloud mail settings. On the iPhone, this is codeSettings/code  codeiCloud/code and toggle the switch next to codeMail/code to codeOff/code.  Then we recreate the iCloud settings.  ol liNavigate to codeSettings/code  codeMail, Contacts and Calendars/code./li liSelect codeAdd Account…/code in the Accounts list, and select the option at the bottom, codeOther/code./li liSelect codeAdd Mail Account/code from the list of options./li liFill in all of your iCloud details, and tap codeNext/code./li liOn the next screen, under codeOutgoing Mail Server/code, fill in codeHost Name/code with codesmtp.me.com/code, and the User Name and Password as per your iCloud login. Under codeIncoming Mail Server/code, fill in gibberish in the fields./li liTap codeNext/code. You’ll get some warnings; just tap through them. For example, I have one that says     This account may not be able to send or receive emails. Are you sure you want to save?/li   /ol   But this is just what we want, so tap codeSave/code, and on the next screen, codeSave/code again.   In theory, your iCloud account should now be able to send mail, but not receive it. (However, it will probably fuss and grumble, and you’ll still have an inbox for the account, albeit empty.)  hr  h2Gmail or third-party mail server/h2  Navigate to codeSettings/code  codeMail, Contacts and Calendars/code  codeGmail/code  codeAccount example@gmail.com/code. Then, in the Gmail Account Information list, delete the Password. (In a third-party mail server, you’re looking for the Incoming Mail Server settings).  Hopefully, if the Outgoing Mail Server still has a correct username and password, you’ll still be able to send mail, but the iPad will fuss and grumble about receiving it.  hr  I hope this is useful and works; or if not, gives you some ideas as to how to make it work.  <comment37956> Have you tried sending mail from within an app, Flipboard for example? Also, knowing why you don't want to download messages to your iPad might help. Is it because you are worried about space on your device? Is it because messages downloaded to your iPad then do not turn up elsewhere? What type of email account do you have - one of the free ones, a corporate one, your own domain? <comment40003> I don't want to be bothered with it on the iPad.  It can wait for until I have a real computer.  The big red circle showing unread messages annoys me.
