Freeing up space on time machine external hard drive <body> My external 500Gb drive is full.  I had an older machine that was backing up for a few years.  I then started with new machine so I had two directories in the Backups.backupdb folder.   My machine is IMAC 2.7Ghz Intel i5 running OS X Yosemite 10.10.2  I deleted the old backup for the old computer via the finder window (probably should not have done that!)  Now I see only the current folder for backups but the drive is still reporting only 10G out of 500G available.  How do I get Time Machine to see the full drive?  <comment213929> Maybe you just need to empty your trash?
