When can the Apple Watch be purchased from in store? <body> I have read reports that the Apple Watch is only available through Apple's online store, yet it will be coming to "in store" sales soon.  Are there any reports for when this will be happening since online orders are still estimated to take 3 weeks to arrive?  <answer190853> last I've heard, the watch will be available in june 2015 in the apple store but in limited quantities also not all watches will be available.  last I've heard, and don't quote me on this... you'll be able to pick one up at the applestore within 2 weeks from now...  <comment226629> So is it possible to order one online and pick it up within the Apple store in approximately 2 weeks? Or are all orders through the online store posted only? <comment226653> At this time, there is no public information and any answer on this question is pure conjecture and speculation. <comment226684> all the online orders has first priority, for example the black one, is one of the most popular one, the stores get them after every preorder online has gotten theirs.. with that being said, it think you'll be able to make a purchase online and pickup at your apple store  check out this article http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/01/apple-watch-june-store-launch/#more-382410 <comment226687> there is no public information no, but to call internal memos speculation is a little far fetched
