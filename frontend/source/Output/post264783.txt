View all call history on iphone 4 <body> Hi,  I want to view the history of ALL my calls on iphone 4. How can I do this? My phone is jailbroken by the way.  Thank you.  <comment331945> Open phone app, tab recents and there is your phone history. <comment332060> @pjctech that will only show calls from the last time you cleared your recent list. It won't show all calls which is what I think the OP is asking about.
