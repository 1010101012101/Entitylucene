Xquartz on Mavericks 10.9 fails <body> There is an issue with running xquartz on my system.  I installed it by using the link from the Apple website. However when I run xquartz from terminal I get:  precode:~$ xquartz /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11: line 10: /usr/local/bin/bash: No such file or directory /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11: line 10: exec: /usr/local/bin/bash: cannot execute: No such file or directory /code/pre  This is preventing me from launching xquartz/x11 applications that I downloaded through macports.  How can I resolve this so that xquartz runs properly?  <answer114389> code/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11/code is just a shell script that executes whatever is defined as code$SHELL/code in your environment:  precodecase $(basename "${SHELL}") in     bash)          exec -l "${SHELL}" --login -c 'exec "${@}"' - "${@}" ;; /code/pre  (etc).  In your case, it look as though code$SHELL/code is set to code/usr/local/bin/bash/code, which doesn't exist. What's interesting, though, is that since you have a prompt at which you have typed codexquartz/code, you clearly are running a shell of some description. However, it doesn't correspond to the value of code$SHELL/code.  Two suggestions for how this might happen:  ol licode$SHELL/code will normally reflect the login shell for your user. You can set that in System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - right click on your username and choose "Advanced Options". If you set this to an invalid value, you won't normally be able to open a terminal... unless you go into the Terminal.app preferences and set the "Shells open with:" option to something which does exist. You'll then get a working terminal with a non-existent code$SHELL/code./li liAlternatively, it might be something in your shell startup scripts (code.bashrc/code, code.profile/code, etc) which export a misleading value of code$SHELL/code to the environment. If you have customized any of these, take a look and make sure you're not setting things up incorrectly./li /ol  <comment134060> Is `/usr/local/bin/bash` an executable/binary or a symlink to one? <comment134097> I did not have any reference to bash in the folder.  I created a symlink for it and it resolved my errors. <comment134098> Thank you for your help; it helped me understand the problem and implement a fix. You're right, I had a shell open already and used `which bash` to give me the correct path. I then created a symlink to that bash and put it in `/usr/local/bin/bash`.  I am now able to use xquartz, tested with xclock, gimp, etc.
