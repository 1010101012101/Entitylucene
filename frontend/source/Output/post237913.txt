Which application changed Mac OS X [Option]+[D] keybinding <body> When I press kbdOption/kbd+kbdD/kbd key in OS X, the current application loses focus. And if I press it again, the current window gets focus back.  How do I know which application bind that or how to avoid it. I checked the shortcuts in System Preferences and there isn't anything like kbdOption/kbd+kbdD/kbd keybinding.  System version:  codeProductName:  Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.11.4 BuildVersion:   15E65 /code  This annoys me so much.  <answer237968> create a new user and login as that new user to see whether it works normally.  In my case, it works normally. Then check login items of the current user: Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login items. Then remove unuseful items and relogin, remember to uncheck codereopen windows when relogin/code.  Then, everything works normally. Thanks Nunzy in #MacOSX channel!  Thank you so much!!!  <comment291600> I can't reproduce this on a system running 10.11.5 Beta (15F24b), perhaps it is a bug that affects your version? <comment291601> maybe not, if I create a new user, it works well. <comment291602> Could you check under System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts and ensure that nothing is set to Option-D? <comment291603> @perhapsmaybeharry yes, i checked that already. nothing is set to option-d <comment291605> Does this happen with all applications or only a certain application? <comment291608> @perhapsmaybeharry every application <comment291672> @perhapsmaybeharry  Thanks for you help. Problem solved. ;-) <comment291673> Which application introduced this key mapping? <comment291676> @danielAzuelos  sorry, I am not sure. Because I remove several items a time. So I did not remember. ;-(
