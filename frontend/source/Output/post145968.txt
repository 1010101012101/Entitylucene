How to change the input source to different language with shortcut (only one key combination)? <body> I want to use four language in my OS X system (English, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese), and I know I can change the language with code⌘/code + codeSpace/code. However, I have a pathological hatred for switching with it, because it requires me to select from so, so many choices! I also know I can change it from the menubar on the right of the bar, but it's much more disgusting than the code⌘/code + codeSpace/code solution.  So I rather want to change it with easier shortcut, like the following:  ul lileft code⌘/code switches to English/li liright code⌘/code switches to Spanish/li lileft code⌘/code + left code⌥/code + codeC/code switches to Chinese/li liright code⌘/code + right code⌥/code + codeC/code switches to Japanese./li /ul  I tried to use codeKarabiner/code (the descendent from codeKeyRemap4MacBook/code), but it doesn't work on the first attempt on Chinese, on which when I switches to Chinese, it remains English (the input source icon on the menubar changes, but the keyboard does not work). But for some reasons if I switch from English to Chinese to English to Chinese (two attempts), then the Chinese keyboard finally works.  So I don't like the idea of using codeKarabiner/code. So what is the better way to change the input source?  <answer145991> kbd ⌘ /kbd is a "dead" key, a modifier key. It does nothing on its own, though as it keeps a count of how many times it's pressed, that would be possibly why it's working at the second attempt.  More to the point... why would you want to use kbd ⌘ /kbd to switch input language,  thereby eliminating its use for any other function.    Why not use F-Keys, perhaps, instead?  A better solution might be one of these...  https://superuser.com/questions/224161/switch-to-specific-input-source  <answer148530> I ran into the same issue with Chinese and Japanese. (The icon on the menu bar changed but the input source was not actually changed until I switched to another input source and back.) It's a known bug according to a post at Karabiner's mailing list:     It's one of the most annoying bug of OS X.      Changing CJK input sources directly from program is not handled appropriately.      So, you need the following procedures.      Step1:br   Enable "Select next source in Input menu" (command-option-space) on System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts.      Step2:br   Change input source by sending command-option-space.  precode&lt;autogen&gt;   __KeyToKey__   KeyCode::K, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L,   KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_US,   KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,   KeyCode::SPACE, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L,   &lt;!-- adjust wait for your machine --&gt;   KeyCode::VK_WAIT_10MS,   KeyCode::VK_WAIT_10MS,   KeyCode::VK_WAIT_10MS,   KeyCode::SPACE, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L,   &lt;!-- adjust wait for your machine --&gt;   KeyCode::VK_WAIT_10MS,   KeyCode::VK_WAIT_10MS,   KeyCode::VK_WAIT_10MS,   KeyCode::SPACE, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L,    Option::NOREPEAT, &lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre   changeinput is affected by the same bug.  Another workaround is to just change to another input source and back:  precode&lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_HIRAGANA&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;inputsourceid_equal&gt;com.apple.inputmethod.Kotoeri.Japanese&lt;/inputsourceid_equal&gt;   &lt;/vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;   &lt;vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_SPANISH&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;inputsourceid_equal&gt;com.apple.keylayout.Spanish&lt;/inputsourceid_equal&gt;   &lt;/vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;   &lt;vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_US&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;inputsourceid_equal&gt;com.apple.keylayout.US&lt;/inputsourceid_equal&gt;   &lt;/vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;   &lt;vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_CHINESE&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;inputsourceid_equal&gt;com.apple.inputmethod.TCIM.Pinyin&lt;/inputsourceid_equal&gt;   &lt;/vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;inputsources&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;inputsources&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_L, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_US, KeyCode::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_SPANISH, KeyCode::COMMAND_R&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::C, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_CHINESE, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_US, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_CHINESE&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::C, ModifierFlag::OPTION_R | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_HIRAGANA, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_US, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_HIRAGANA&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment172017> I don't stick to using the apple key. (maybe you might have mistaken `⌘`(command key) with the apple key...?) <comment172021> Well, it's because `⌘` is the easiest to type, and switching between different languages occur so, so frequently. <comment172023> my point still stands. <comment175475> Your second solution disables the command key for all the other shortcuts (like `⌘`+`W` to close the window), which is definitely not what I want... As to the 1st solution, I'll try it later. <comment175488> As to your first solution, I'm not sure why you want to wait 160ms and switch it three times... <comment175605> Hmmm... I still have issues in the `__KeyOverlaidModifier__` as noted above, but I switched Japanese and Spanish inputsource because Japanese inputsource can function properly if you set it from within Karabiner's preferences in the Japanese inputsource section. Thanks for the answer.
