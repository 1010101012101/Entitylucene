Filesorter alternative <body> I found a really cool app in the App Store called FileSorter  It automatically sort files. Is there any FREE alternative?    <answer7640> I've found this site a little while ago that let's me see if there are alternatives to apps either because they're on Windows (and the app's not important enough to boot Parallels) or too expensive: alternativeto.net  Give that a try and see what you can find. Specifically for you, this is what I found there.  <answer11322> Actually, that application emis/em free.  <comment10058> Uh, that application appears to be currently free already.
