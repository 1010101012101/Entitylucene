GUI applications installed with homebrew cannot be launched using Spotlight <body> I have installed cocoa versions of both Emacs and MacVim using homebrew. After the installation, the actual applications are installed in code/usr/local/opt/emacs/Emacs.app/code and code/usr/local/opt/macvim/MacVim.app/code  They are then symlinked to code/Applications/code  They now appear in my Applications folder, but if I want to start them using Spotlight, they do not turn up in the search results when I start typing (like other applications do)  Is there anything I can do to remedy this?  <answer216370> There are many workarounds for this,   ul liyou can copy Emacs and MacVim direclty to your code/Applications/code folder : codecp -r /usr/local/opt/emacs/Emacs.app /Applications//code and codecp -r /usr/local/opt/macvim/MacVim.app /Applications//code./li liYou can run codesudo chflags nohidden /usr/code, /usr folder is flagged as hidden but not /opt, this command will unhide /usr so that Spotlight could index it (Spotlight doesn't index hidden directories)./li liYou can also make a shell script and appify it  precode#!/bin/bash open /usr/local/opt/emacs/Emacs.app /code/pre/li liThere is also an option in homebrew , I've not tested it personnaly, that fixes this issue : codebrew linkapps --system/code, you can remove --system if you want brew to link your.app to code~/Applications/code instead of code/Applications/code/li /ul  <comment314115> I have tried `brew linkapps`. It creates a symlink in `/Applications/` to the right thing, but Spotlight still doesn't find it. However, if I “Make Alias” in Finder and put that in `/Applications/`, it does find it. (Note: I'm trying with `IDLE 3.app`, not Emacs or MacVim.)
