Why is corestoraged preventing sleep in macOS 10.12.3? <body> I've noticed consistently that a day or so after reboot, my Mac will refuse to go to sleep. Activity Monitor shows that the process codecorestoraged/code is preventing sleep. If I reboot, it will no longer be listed as a process preventing sleep -- until it starts doing so again.  Does anyone understand why this is happening? Is this a bug in 10.12.3?  <answer273324> 1) If FileVault is encrypting your disk you will see codecorestoraged/code as a blocking process.  2) If Time Machine is encrypting an external drive with backup codecorestoraged/code will be also blocking sleep (even if the backup disk is unmounted and not connected to the Mac!!!).  precodeâžœ  ~ pmset -g System-wide power settings: Currently in use: standbydelay         10800 standby              1 womp                 1 halfdim              1 hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage powernap             1 gpuswitch            2 networkoversleep     0 disksleep            10 sleep                10 (sleep prevented by corestoraged) autopoweroffdelay    28800 hibernatemode        3 autopoweroff         1 ttyskeepawake        1 displaysleep         10 acwake               0 lidwake              1 /code/pre  In my case, it was the Time Machine. After it finished encryption of the backup disk (took a week or so) codecorestoraged/code is not longer causing a sleep issues.  <comment343718> Thanks. I wasn't initially encrypting either my internal or external storage, but after running Disk Utility, corestorage doesn't seem to be preventing sleep.
