Safari keeps asking me to unlock login keychain <body> I'm on 10.12.1 and use Safari 10.0.1 and from time to time Safari asks me to unlock login keychain but then does not accept my input and asks again.  This happens sometimes when I open a new tab which shows the Top Sites. But it also happened when I just moved a bookmark in my Favourites bar around.  I tried to disable all extensions but the prompt appeared again.  So, what can I do to resolve this?  Thanks  <comment329836> Alright, I think I figured it out. This always happens when I try to login into the SAP system at work.
