Time Machine sparsebundle mounting problems <body> h2Problem/h2  I have a Time Machine backup which contains stronga lot/strong of valuable information and I'm trying to access it. What's the problem? I'm trying to mount it and nothingsup1/sup happens.  ol liNothing happens? So I tried to eject the network disk containing the sparsebundle and I got an error saying:/li /ol     "The disk backups couldn't be ejected because finder it using it"   What??? My guess is DiskImageMounter is mounting but is emridiculously/em slow?  h2Notes / Updates/h2     Note: codeinstalld/code is eating up my CPU usage, is this in anyway related to DiskImageMounter      Note 2: If I go to "Browse Other Backup Disks" it finds the sparsebundle but none of the backups show.      Update: Seems like codemds/code is going crazy on the backup drive. I'll try to disable spotlight and see what I can do   hr  There must surely be a better way to browse a Time Machine backup on a network disk  If not, how can my problem be fixed?  <answer226312> h1It's not Time Machine, or anything/h1  It's emSpotlight/em. How?  h2Spotlight/h2  Spotlight indexes emeverything/em. Even on an external disk. My backup .sparsebundle was strong 2 TB/strong. My computer can't handle this. Spotlight would index everything before it showed in finder.  h2Debugging/h2  First, to see emwhat/em was using the disk. Run:  precodesudo lsof | grep /Volumes/&lt;Volume Name&gt; /code/pre  I got something like:  precodediskimage 519           vihan    4r      mds /code/pre  and about 4 of those. That meant Spotlight was going haywire.  h2Disabling/h2  Disabling spotlight is simple. strongRUN THIS BEFORE TOUCHING THE .SPARSEBUNDLE/strong  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  That should disable Spotlight. Now you can double click the .sparsebundle and continue as from this answer  <comment274811> If you reboot your system does the issue persist? For `installd` see [What is installd, and why is it eating my CPU?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/87109/what-is-installd-and-why-is-it-eating-my-cpu) <comment274812> @user3439894 yup of course. I know about `installd` but I just added it if it has anything to do with mounting the disk image <comment274813> You didn't answer my question! So I'll ask it again. If you reboot your system does the issue persist?  As far as `installd` have you looked at Open Files and Ports for it in Activity Monitor to see if it shows anything pointing to the Time Machine sparse bundle? <comment274814> @user3439894 yes I think `fsck_hfs` looks like it's something to do with mounting. It does persist if I restart. I'm not seeing an `Open Files and Ports` tab... <comment274815> actually now I'm seeing a `diskimages-helper` which is accessing the disk images... It's been over 30 minutes and no mount so I'll see if anything happens <comment274818> To see the Open Files and Ports tab, if it exists for a given process, just double-click the name of the process. <comment274819> @user3439894 yeah. It only shows for some processes. Will this mount the *entire* backup sparsebundle to my computer? Currently over 3GB and rising amount of RAM has been allocated to the mounting processes
