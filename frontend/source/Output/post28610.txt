How can I use my Apple bluetooth keyboard for keyboard navigation on my iPad? <body> I'm using an Apple bluetooth keyboard with my iPad. Even in Safari, arrow keys, Cmd-arrow for forward and back, Cmd-D for bookmark, etc do not work.  The only useful keyboard navigation is Return, Tab and Shift-Tab.  Are there perhaps some jailbroken apps that provide some sort of keyboard navigation shim?  Perhaps through GUI macros?  <answer28616> I am sorry to say that I am unaware of any apps (jailbroken or otherwise) that add keyboard navigation to the iPad.  According to GigaOm, the following shortcuts do work:  ul likbd⌘/kbdkbdC/kbd Copy selected text/li likbd⌘/kbdkbdX/kbd Cut selected text/li likbd⌘/kbdkbdV/kbd Paste/li likbd⌘/kbdkbdZ/kbd Undo/li likbd⌘/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdZ/kbd Redo/li likbd⌘/kbdkbd↑/kbd Go to top of document/li likbd⌘/kbdkbd↓/kbd Go to bottom of document/li likbd⌘/kbdkbd←/kbd Go to start of line/li likbd⌘/kbdkbd→/kbd Go to end of line/li likbd⌘/kbdkbd⌫/kbd Delete to end of line/li likbd⌥/kbdkbd⌫/kbd Delete previous word/li likbdF1/kbd Make screen dimmer/li likbdF2/kbd Make screen brighter/li likbdF7/kbd Skip back one song/li likbdF8/kbd Play or Pause Music/li likbdF9/kbd Skip forward one song/li likbdF10/kbd Mute Volume/li likbdF11/kbd Decrease Volume/li likbdF12/kbd Increase Volume /li likbd⏏/kbd Show or hide onscreen keyboard/li /ul  <answer51868> There is a nice article on enabling some keyboard features using VoiceOver. It is not perfect, especially due to the fact that it disables normal typing and scrolling with fingers, but it allows you to:  ul liSelect items with keyboard (Left &amp; Right buttons)/li liOpen Home Screen (Ctrl+Opt+H) and running applications (double that shortcut)/li liQuick Search on current screen (Ctrl+Opt+I)/li liand more./li /ul  I wish I could enable these shortcuts without switching on the whole VoiceOver feature.   <comment32899> What version of iOS are you running? <comment32908> I am running IOS 5. <comment33146> Sad.  I wonder if any Cydia or other jail broken apps provide this functionality. <comment59700> That article changed my life. Fantastic!
