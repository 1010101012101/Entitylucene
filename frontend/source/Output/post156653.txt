I accidentally deleted an iMovie project, but I recovered it. Now it is too blurry to see! <body> I accidentally deleted an iMovie event with an important school project within it, but I recovered it by going to Finder, then clicking Movies. I re-uploaded them to iMovie but now they are so blurry, I cannot see the video! Please help me revert it back to its original state of clarity in time for presentation date, being Monday!  <answer156689> sounds like you only recovered the low-quality proxies.   The structure should be   ul liProject Name folder, containing ul liCurrentVersion.imovieevent file &amp;/li liProfect Name.rcproject folder, containing ol liMovies folder/li liProject file/li liProxies folder/li liQuickLook/li /ol/li /ul/li /ul  That applies whether you have the old iMovie structure or the new one.br If you have the new structure that doesn't look like a folder, then right click the iMovie Library 'file' &amp; select 'Show Package Contents' - then you will see the actual folder structure  <comment184287> I don't exactly understand what you are telling me to do. I went to the Movies folder and from there I can only click iMovie Events or iMovie Projects. If I click Events My new options are iMovie Dropbox or the event that contains the project I lost but in very poor quality. There is nothing in the iMovie Dropbox folder. If we go back to the start, click Movies, then click iMovie Projects, I only have the option to click "My First Project", an instructional guide to making a video on iMovie. In simple words can you help me revert the video back to its original, high quality? Im sorry! <comment238263> You cannot "revert a video to high quality", you can find the original movies and reassemble the project. <comment238264> Nevermind, the presentation date seems to be long gone...
