Are special characters allowed for an iPhone’s name? <body> I know stronghow/strong to rename my iPhone.  I'm curious if there is any problem with adding a character to the iPhone's name.  Specifically, can I rename it to "strongTMH's iP7+/strong" with the plus sign at the end?  I have looked online and cannot find any mention if this is an issue.  <answer278343> Symbols are fine, including a plus sign or even emoji.  <answer278356> You may notice oddness when sharing your Internet connection through Personal Hotspot. Some devices don’t play nice with non-Latin alpha characters, and may display funky characters in the list of Wi-Fi networks (though the connection should work fine).  I suppose your mileage may vary here, but other than that, what @grgarside said.
