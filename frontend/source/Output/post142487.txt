How can I make Time Machine do a full backup? <body> Recently, my Time Machine disk exhibited some filesystem errors.  Disk Utility was able to correct them, but I don't trust the existing backup content much, and by extension, don't trust incremental backups made against that content.  I would like to force Time Machine to create a new, full backup (or, at the very least, an incremental backup while actually comparing all files and their content) without destroying the old backup content.  I know I can destroy the existing backups and go again, but I'd rather preserve the history, imperfect as it may be.  How can (or, even, can) I do this?  <answer142492> The mechanism to force a full backup isn't well documented, but it does get logged to the console logs as strongForcing deep traversal on source: "Macintosh HD" .../strong but even if this happens, the system will base the storage of new copies of files on what exists on the backup volume previously.  I would add a new drive and back up to it once if you are concerned that your backup is no longer reliable.  From the command line, you can then check on things with codetmutil compare/code or by using a tool such as BackupLoupe to convince yourself that specific (or ongoing) backups are correctly being made.  <comment265343> Were you able to _make_ TM to do a full backup? <comment266155> @Crowder Unfortunately, no.
