Unable to Delete Email Using Hotmail on IOS 6 <body> When attempting to delete emails in the Mail app using hotmail (exchange server) there is always the error: "the message could not be moved to the mailbox trash"  Messages used to delete just fine, but this error message is a recent problem.    <comment115192> If you try to file the messages into another folder, does that fail you as well? In the past we had to go [choose the deleted messages folder when it got unset](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2475) and more recently, you had to see if there were IMAP settings with a root that you could set to INBOXâ€¦ but I'm not sure these address the changes to outlook.com. I hate to suggest POP access, but that might be the only workaround at present... <comment115198> are you trashing it locally or on the server?
