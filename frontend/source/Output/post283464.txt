Where is the option to disable iTerm2 confirm window on Log off? <body> I have MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra. When I try to Log off system I get annyoing confirm dialog each time. Here is it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jmxez.png" width="420"  It says that it was prompted because of some option enabled. This option here:br “Prefs  General  Confirm Quit iTerm2”.  What ‘Prefs’ is this about?  I have this in System Preferences  General, and iTerm 2 context menu  Edit Session….  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R3Rkk.png" width="320" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O30R6.png" width="320"  Nether System Preferences nor iTerm2 prefs has this checkbox. So how I can disable this confirm dialog on log off?  <answer283466> In macOS, you can find the preferences for any app by choosing the app name in the menu bar, then selecting Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sfce3.png" width="326"  In this case, the preference being referred to is this one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UUOkZ.png" width="300"  <answer283467> That Preference is an iTerm2 preference.  In iTerm2 go to Preferences, choose the General icon. There is a section on Closing this includes codeConfirm "Quit iTerm2 (⌘Q)" command/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DHcbi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment357385> Thank you for you answer!
