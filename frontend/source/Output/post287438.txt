Do you have a python3 install (e.g. with homebrew) besides the stock Python 2.7? <comment362923> I ran the install with python 3 version of pip and it installed but the program I am trying to run still couldn't find the "wireless" module. from wireless import Wireless ImportError: No module named wireless
