To get Graphical Info reader in El Capitan? <body> Graphical info reader is the reader which colorises links in the info pages. I know there are good options in OS X but I cannot find them.  I do codehome search info/code and I get  precodehomebrew/science/clinfo    media-info                 shared-mime-info          ipinfo                     mp3info                    texinfo                   jpeginfo                   pinfo                     homebrew/emacs/pkg-info                  Caskroom/cask/mac-informer              homebrew/games/inform6                   Caskroom/cask/mediainfo                 Caskroom/cask/inform                     Caskroom/cask/pdfinfo /code/pre  but nothing seems to be a info -pages reader.   hr  How can you get a graphical reader of info -pages in El Capitan?  <answer238357> The obvious one is emacs itself as info is its documentation format  The Apple supplied emacs does do this in the terminal as do more up to date ones  There are graphical versions Emacs.app for pure emacs and Aquamacs trying to be more like a standard OSX app.   If you need this from the command line other make .info files opened by the emacs app and use the command open or use emacsclient  <answer249893> While it isn't strictly graphical, I find codepinfo/code to be much more usable than most alternatives for reading info pages, and it can also read man pages. codepinfo/code can be installed with codebrew install pinfo/code. Its key bindings, appearance, and behavior can be configured in a rudimentary fashion by editing code/usr/local/etc/pinforc/code.  If you want to use codepinfo/code in a graphical environment, I'd suggest creating a script that runs it inside your favorite terminal.  hr  The standard GNU codeinfo/code reader (which is also terminal-based) is installed as part of the codetexinfo/code package in Homebrew, but according to the codeinfo/code docs,     Emacs Info and stand-alone Info have nearly identical user interfaces, although customization and other details are different   For me, that makes the standard codeinfo/code reader a no-go as well. (I'm also a Dvorak/Vim user)  hr  Another option is to use the code/usr/local/Cellar/texinfo/*/bin/texi2any/code program (from the codetexinfo/code package) with the code--html/code option to convert info pages to HTML, and then view them in a web browser. This requires a lot of up-front work before reading them, but could be worth it if you emreally/em prefer a graphical reader.  <comment292298> Cocoa emacs :) (Emacs.app or Aquamacs) <comment292299> @Mark Yes, it is one option. Please, add your proposal to get and use it for reading info files as an answer. <comment292300> Can you please add short summary of the keys how you read those info pages in Emacs. I am Vim and Dvorak user :) <comment292303> @Masi info is originally the Emacs/Gnu documentation project and so uses standard Emacs keys (see many docs) which NeXT copied as its shortcut keys in what became OSX so see OSX key shortcuts as well <comment292304> How can you open `info gtime` in Aquamacs? <comment310096> One other caveat I noticed is that with [keg-only packages](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17015285/understand-homebrew-and-keg-only-dependencies), since their info files are also not linked into the `/usr/local/share/info` tree, you have to specify their full path when viewing them. With `pinfo`: `pinfo -f /usr/local/Cellar/readline/*/share/info/readline.info` <comment310098> How do you read man pages yourself? <comment310280> I always use `pinfo` in a terminal; I've used it for years, and since it defaults to `lynx`-style navigation, it's really easy to get the hang of. (Up and Down select links on the page, Right or Enter follows the current link, and Left goes back) <comment310301> In your pointed out thread, you can check which files are keg-only by `otool -L /usr/local/Cellar/vips/???/lib/*‌​.dylib`.
