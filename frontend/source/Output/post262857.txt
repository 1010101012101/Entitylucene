Any trick to add photo to empty contact names? <body> Many services (BlaBlaCar, Banks, train companies) send SMS messages with a "fake" sender name and empty number, and the new iOS 10 message list is quite boring and difficult to read with the same icon. I've found no ways to save these senders as new contacts and add them a photo. Any ideas??  emUpdate/em: As you can see in the attached screenshot many services use SMS for notifications and having some graphic icons would be VERY useful to recognize them at a glance - instead of all that "persons" icons - but they originate from a completely "empty" contact template (no real phone number), if I click on the person icon I don't see any data, so that adding this as a new contact is actually not linked to the SMS anyway.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9vhd.jpg" alt="screenshot"  <answer262862> Try as:  ol liOpen Message app and open a particular SMS./li liTap Circular Person Icon at the top. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FfIrk.png" alt="Circular Person Icon"/li liTap codeCreate New Contact/code option which will open a page where you can edit contact information and add a photo to the contact as well./li /ol  That's how you will be able to save a contact from message app and add a photo as well.br However, I couldn't understand your purpose/scenario quite clearly, so shed some more light onto your problem so that the community can answer your question accurately.  <comment330100> Updated question to show more info!
