Alternating Page Styles for "Left" and "Right" Pages? <body> So I have a good looking style that I'm pleased with except for one point; I'm using a page decoration that is on the left for the first page of a section, and on the right for the next page.  The problem is that if I have more than two pages, then all additional pages use the right-side version of the layout, i.e- a Layout in iBooks Author is a first page, then all subsequent pages.  In Pages it was (still is?) possible to define different masters for right and left pages, allowing an alternation to be defined that would give the kind of results I desire, but I can't seem to find a way to do this in iBooks Author except by having individual left and right page layouts and inserting these as required, which of course isn't ideal at all since text doesn't flow from one to the next (i.e- they're separate entities).  Of course I realise there isn't strictly the same concept of left and right in an iBook, however I find that the decoration helps to visually group pairs of pages together. In fact, really what I'd like to be able to define is a first page, one or more middle pages, then a last page, but I'd settle for being able to define a simple alternating (odd/even) style pattern, if at all possible.  So, can anything like this be done, or am stuck using different page styles and/or adding the decoration after the fact (i.e- not within the Layout)?
