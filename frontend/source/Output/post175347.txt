iOS Device Serial List <body> Does anyone know of a list of iOS serial numbers that marries the respective device types to the last 3 characters of the device serial? I know there are query sites out there where you can pump in the entire serial number but I'm looking for a comprehensive list that accounts for all models and sub-models.  In example:  ul liCP7 -- iPod 4th Gen/li liFHW -- iPad 2nd Gen/li li196 -- iPad Mini 1st Gen/li /ul  I'm trying to avoid compiling this for all devices in my environment but I can't seem to find anything that already exists.  <answer175391> iOS-based devices:  ul liiPad (3rd Generation) (Wi-Fi + 3G CDMA) - NQV/li liiPad Air 2 (Wi-Fi + Cellular) - 5YN/li liiPad mini Retina (2nd Generation) (Wi-Fi) - CM9/li liiPhone 6 - 5MG/li liiPod touch (5th Generation) - 4JR/li /ul  iPods (pre-iPod touch):  ul li5th Generation (Late 2006) - V9K, V9P, V9M, V9R, V9L, V9N, V9Q, V9S, WU9, WUA, WUB, WUC, X3N (complete list per Apple)/li li5th Generation U2 Special Edition (Late 2006) - W9G (complete list per Apple)/li liClassic (120GB) - Y5N, YMU, YMV, YMX (complete list per Apple)/li liNano (3rd generation) - YOP, YOR, YXR, YXT, YXV, YXX (complete list per Apple)/li liShuffle (2nd Generation) (Early 2008) - 1ZH, 1ZK, 1ZM, 1ZP, 1ZR (complete list per Apple)/li /ul  For names, we use:  ul liiPad - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201471/li liiPhone - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201296/li liiPod - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1353/li liApple TV - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200008/li /ul  <answer175412> Since there was obviously nothing out there in the wild I got bored after a couple of beers and pulled this from half of our environment. The list really does clean up a lot better as a CSV separated out by Device Type / Generation / Communication Type.   precodeiPod 4th - 96T, CP7, CP9, NQY, T75, T77 iPod 5th - 4K4, FCJ, MJF, 4JR  iPad 1st Wifi - Z38 iPad 1st 3G - A90, ETU iPad 2nd Wifi - FHW, FHY, KPH iPad 2nd GSM - FJ1, FJ2 iPad 2nd CDMA - KPL iPad 3rd Wifi - J8R, J8T iPad 3rd CDMA - NQR,NQV iPad 4th Wifi - 182, 183, 185  iPad Mini 1st Wifi - 193, 196, 637 iPad Mini 2nd Wifi - CM9 iPad Mini 3rd Wifi - 5V3  iPad Air 1st Wifi - K10, K11, K14 iPad Air 1st Cellular - 4YD iPad Air 2nd Wifi - 5VJ iPad Air 2nd Cellular - 5YN  iPhone 4S - TC1 iPhone 6 - 5MG, 5MN /code/pre  (Added the devices from above answer)  <comment206780> This could be the place where the internet does the work. Why not start a stub of an answer and [we can all chip away](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23577/how-many-genius-mixes-are-there-in-itunes) at it wiki style? If someone swoops in later with a better resource, that's fine too. Also, are the last 3 even good enough to tell all models? I suppose with enough data we can figure that out too. <comment206784> @tubedogg Nice edit - should we sort the bullets alphabetically (easier for various editors to keep it clean and non-duplicated) - your findings on the multiple endings makes having the names first make much more sense <comment206897> @bmike Yes - the last 3 are Apple's secret sauce. Even reaching out to my Enterprise Apple Rep yielded an answer of "that's an interesting question. Regardless I've added a ton to my answer below.
