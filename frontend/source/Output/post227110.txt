ITerm2 Console connection to Cisco equipment Control-A does not work <body> I connect to Cisco Equipment via console cable and am currently trying to use ITerm2.    The problem is I cannot get the Control-A (Move to beginning of line) command to work.  I've tried to add in the hex code ^a with 0x01  with no luck..  Funny thing is..  Control-A works as expected if I am in ITerm2 and:  ul liAm browsing my local drive / directories  /li liConnected to Cisco equipment via telnet or SSH/li /ul  I only see Control-A NOT work if I'm connected via the console cable.  The Control-E (Move to end), Control-U(Delete line) always work as expected though regardless if I'm connected via console or other remote access.  Anybody have any thoughts on what I can change to get this one function working.    I am running the below command when loading my cisco profile:  screen /dev/cu.usbserial-A9030WJK  -f 9600,cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl  USB to Ethernet cable, I am not using the usb - serial adapter and I'm using a 13" MBA laptop El Cap.  <answer243769> updated ITERM to 3.0.2.. now Control-A works as expected when SSH'd into a cisco router. â€“  <comment275868> Does it work with Terminal.app ? <comment278026> @Mark ul - Terminal Console Connect to Router:  NO    - Terminal ssh to Router:  yes    - Console connection to Router - ssh to another router:  no    - SSH from OS X (using ITerm) to Router (Same physical devicde as above):  yes <comment300293> updated ITERM to 3.0.2..  now Control-A works as expected when SSH'd into a cisco router.
