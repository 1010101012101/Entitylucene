MBP boots only through single user mode <body> After using my MBP and shutting it down as usual, it fails to boot.  If no keys are pressed during booting ( normal boot ), a progress bar will appear on the bottom side of the screen, moves slowly, and shut downs after 4-5 seconds.  Booting with verbose mode enabled ( holding Cmd+V while booting ) gives the following logs before it dies :  precodehfs: mounted SSD on device root_device com.apple.launchd                1       com.apple.launchd com.apple.launchd                1       com.apple.launchd  *** com.apple.launchd ** /dev/rdisk0s2 (NO WRITE) ** Root file system Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-226.1.1). ** /dev/rdisk0s2 ** Root file system Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-226.1.1). ** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.

I have no idea what caused this and the solution to this problem. Please help me on solving this issue.  <answer116434> It seems to be a  sector fault on your SSD, maybe OSX know this and refuse to boot regularly. Try to boot a Linux liveDVD and check for bad sectors (from its terminal):  precodesudo badblocks -v /dev/YourSSD /code/pre  <answer116449> At this point, you will want to boot to single user mode (or target mode) and copy off any files that are not backed up.  At that point, boot to Recovery HD and attempt to erase the Macintosh HD so that you can clean up the filesystem.  If you have an external drive to boot, that would be better as you could then repartition the entire SSD and then attempt Internet Recovery or another re-install of the OS. If you can't repair the SSD using software, then it will need a hardware swap of the drive or a repair of the Mac.  <answer118561> Issue solved; no physical errors. These are what I did:  First I analyzed where the error occurred :  precode... ** Checking catalog file. Invalid index key (4, 20220) Invalid node structure (4, 38065) The volume SSD could not be verified completely. ... /code/pre  codefsck/code stops while scanning catalog files. Let's try reading codefsck_hfs/code user manual by executing codeman fsck_hfs/code for clues.  precode... -R flags Rebuilds the requested btree.  The following flags are supported:      a       Attribute btree      c       Catalog btree      e       Extents overflow btree ... /code/pre  Let's try rebuilding catalog btree then. codefsck_hfs -Rc /dev/rdisk0s2/code  Results: codefsck/code does not stop at catalog file check anymore, and the codeInvalid index key/code error disappeared, revealing more errors ( clues! ).  precode** Checking extents overflow file. Incorrect block count for file Cache.db-wal (It should be 114 instead of 119) ** Checking catalog file.

Invalid node structure The volume SSD could not be verified completely. /code/pre  codefsck/code now stops when checking extended attributes file. Let's try rebuilding the attributes btree with codefsck -Ra /dev/rdisk0s2/code.  Result(s): All errors, except codeInvalid node structure/code disappeared after the first repair attempt. It shows several invalid nodes, then attempts the second repair, and rechecks. It still shows some invalid nodes, but even less then before.  However the codefsck/code stops with a message saying that it stops making repair attempts after 3 check failures. I ran codefsck -Ra /dev/rdisk0s2/code again. It attempts to repair again, then rechecks. No invalid node structure error shows up!  It now makes codeInvalid volume free blocks count/code, codeInvalid volume file count/code, and codeInvalid volume directory count/code errors, but it doesn't stop yet!  After yet another attempt of repair, codefsck/code finished without any errors.  Shut down. Boot normally without entering single user mode. And it works! Problem solved by running codefsck/code several times, rebuilding catalog btree, and attribute btree several times.  <answer118802> I had a similar issue, only way to boot was SUM then mount -uw then exit and OSX would boot. Tried to mount as write via recovery partition and TechTool Pro eDrive and failed at every turn. I bought disk warrior and ran it off my TTP edrive USB, BINGO it fixed it !!!!  Below is the errors, I didn't check the read more first unfortunately  • 1 file had a duplicate ID that was repaired.!br ! • 17 files had a directory entry with an incorrect text encoding value that was repaired.!br ! • 1 folder had a custom icon that was found to be damaged.!br ! • 2 folders had a directory entry with an incorrect custom icon flag that was repaired.!br ! • 3 folders had a directory entry with an incorrect text encoding value that was repaired.!    ! • Incorrect values in the Volume Information were repaired.!br ! • Critical values in the Volume Information were incorrect and were repaired.!  <comment138324> Note: I also ran `fsck_hfs` with S parameter to scan for bad blocks **before doing any of above**. I proceeded to investigate the issue because there were no bad blocks(no physical failure/error). Doing any of the above with bad blocks... might be bad.
