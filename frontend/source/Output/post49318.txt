With the "small" Mac keyboard, how to simulate a HOME, END, and PageUp, PageDown key? <body> My desk is a little too narrow for the long type of Apple keyboard -- the one that has the keypad and the kbdHome ↖/kbd, kbdEnd ↘/kbd, kbdPage Up ⇞/kbd, kbdPage Down ⇟/kbd keys...  (it will take up the space for the mouse).  So if the small (wireless) keyboard is used, is there a way to simulate these keys: kbdHome ↖/kbd, kbdEnd ↘/kbd, kbdPage Up ⇞/kbd, kbdPage Down ⇟/kbd?  (kbdHome ↖/kbd takes a user to beginning of page, kbdEnd ↘/kbd takes the user to end of page).  In some apps like Chrome and Safari, kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdUp ↑/kbd is like kbdHome ↖/kbd, and kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd↓ Down/kbd is like kbdEnd ↘/kbd.  kbdFn/kbd + kbdUp ↑/kbd is like kbdPage Up ⇞/kbd, kbdFn/kbd + kbd↓ Down/kbd is like kbdPage Down ⇟/kbd, but it won't work in some apps such as in Finder (File Manager) and iTunes, where both of them will only do PageUp and PageDown simulation but not kbdHome ↖/kbd orkbdEnd ↘/kbd simulation.  I have this keyboard:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pz8ng.jpg" alt="Apple keyboard"br Not this keyboard (which has the dedicated kbdHome ↖/kbd, kbdEnd ↘/kbd, kbdPage Up ⇞/kbd, and kbdPage Down ⇟/kbd keys):br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1qan.jpg" alt="Apple extended keyboard"  <answer49319> The kbdCommand/kbd+kbdUp/Down/kbd keys you mentioned for Chrome and Safari are coincidences. The kbdFn/kbd+kbdUp/Down/kbd keys are not. Those key combinations are actually mapped to the Page up/Page down keycodes, so the application thinks you actually pressed those keys. There are similar mappings for Home and End: kbdFn/kbd+kbdLeft/kbd and kbdFn/kbd+kbdRight/kbd, respectively. These kbdFn/kbd+kbdArrow/kbd mappings will work exactly like Page Up/Down and Home/End in any application, unless it somehow is working around the system.  <comment56452> perfect!  why didn't I think of that! <comment167504> This is great if you can use two hands. But is there a way to do this with only one hand? I cannot spread my fingers far enough to operate both 'Fn' and 'arrow up' or 'arrow down' simultaneously. <comment167508> @Mark I don't know of another combination. You could turn on Sticky keys in System Preferences  Accessibility  Keyboard, which would let you press fn then the arrow separately. <comment167546> Worth noting that the same applies for MacBook keyboards. <comment231333> For Windows Remote Desktop, you can use: fn+control+left/right for control+Home and control+End. fn+control+up/down for PageUp and PageDown.
