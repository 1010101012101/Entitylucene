Add new font to Java JRE so java can recognize it <body> I'm using a java program with a dropdown box to select some fonts to use. I want to add a new font into this list. The manufacturer said that I had to add the font file to my jre/lib/fonts directory, but where can I find it? In the Frameworks-Path there is no fonts directory... thank you!  <comment23946> Did you try just creating it? <comment23948> Where creating what? I have this font available in other programs like illustrator...
