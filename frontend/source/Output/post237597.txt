Force enabling TRIM before setup assistant is run <body> Basically, I'm preparing to give a MacBook Pro, running Mac OS X 10.11.4, to someone, but I need to execute "sudo trimforce enable" beforehand, as it contains an aftermarket SSD (fully compatible with TRIM). I wanted them to be able to use the normal setup assistant, so creating a user to run the command is not ideal.  Is it possible to boot into recovery or single user mode and run the command, without having to create a user account?  Thank you.  <answer237670> You can boot into OS X Recovery mode by pressing CMD+R at startup, after it boots and OS X Utility comes up, go to Application menu and them Terminal. Then you can execute codesudo trimforce enable/code. You can also boot into single user mode and execute the command (If it doesn't work in single user mode them try taking out the sudo).
