Facedown detection on iPhone 6 with iOS 9 <body> Apple highlights that an iPhone — and presumably other iOS devices — will use light and proximity sensors to determine whether it's laying face-down, and stop the screen from turning on even when notifications come in.  It does not seem to work on my iPhone 6. Do I have to enable low power mode for this to work?  <answer206280> Yes. You should enable low power mode for it to work  <answer206769> The motion coprocessor setting are what govern this battery saving option.  Settings  Privacy  Motion &amp; Fitness  Fitness Tracking   On setting allow the motion coprocessor and proximity sensors to shut off the screen if they detect a face down orientation.  You can test the sensors by checking motion in the health app for step count (for instance) and by making a call and testing the proximity sensor turning off the screen when it is covered.  See this nice article for more information: http://www.iphonehacks.com/2015/09/why-facedown-detection-feature-in-ios-9-doesnt-support-iphone-5-iphone-4s-ipads-and-ipod-touches.html  <comment248675> That's very weird. Even when I turn low power mode and auto-brightness on, the face down detection won't work on my iPhone 5S. <comment249114> It doesn't seem to work. I'm on an iPhone 4S/iOS9 and even with Low-Power mode on it doesn't work. Hope Apple makes some official comments on it and/or fix it on the next update. <comment249152> it didn't work, it still lights up <comment249993> Works on my 6 without low power mode. <comment250027> -1 Low power mode has nothing to do with this feature. Can you provide a link or explanation why you feel low power will affect this? <comment250733> this worked after the new update 9.0.1. i have no idea why, cause the update had nothing in the description about it. thanks
