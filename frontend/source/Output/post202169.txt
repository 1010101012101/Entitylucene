How can I “Open an app from an unidentified developer” without using the GUI? <body> Basically, I used the native codeSafari.app/code web browser to download a third party application and I want to run / codeopen/code it from the comfort of my codebash/code shell / codeTerminal.app/code CLI; despite the following error message:  precode“&lt;unidentified_thirdparty.app&gt;” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified   developer. Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac   App Store and identified developers. Safari downloaded this file on &lt;today's_date&gt;   from &lt;the.inter.net&gt;.                                           |[OK]| /code/pre  <answer202172> You'll either have to change the settings under strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongGeneral/strong  strongAllow applications downloaded from:/strong emto/em strongAnywhere/strong emor/em in a strongTerminal/strong, strip the codexattr/code strongcom.apple.quarantine/strong attribute from the downloaded file(s).  precodexattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "unidentified_thirdparty.app" /code/pre  <comment246903> I was aware of the GUI method. The next part looks spot-on though. What exactly does the `com.apple.quarantine` (attribute) argument refer to? <comment273956> @tjt263, Sorry I didn't see your comment until now... All filesystem objects have attributes, e.g. information you'd see in the output of the `ls -l file` command. Filesystem objects also have extended attributes of which `com.apple.quarantine` is one that is assigned to objects downloaded from the Internet by OS X to help prevent arbitrary execution and thus one level of protecting the system. Using `ls -lR@ file` or `xattr −lr file` will show extended attribute information the latter of which will output more extensive information. See `man xattr` for more information. <comment273997> Wow. That's interesting. I did not know about that. Do other Operating Systems have something like this in place? <comment289816> You can also use either right-click (aka ctrl-click) and choose "Open", to allow executing just that app. <comment289819> @HawkenRives, Did you miss in the Title where it said "**without using the GUI?**"!? He wants to use the command line from Terminal, so your comment to my answer is irrelevant! <comment289820> Excellent point. I had indeed missed that. (I will note, though, that the first part of your answer requires the use of the GUI, as well.) <comment289821> @HawkenRives, Yes it does as it's a global setting not the actual running or opening of the file as the right-click on the file does.  Using `xattr` portion of my answer cover the command line and Terminal.
