How to write AND condition in Numbers <body> I have a dataset where I want to write a codeCOUNTIF/codestatement in Numbers (Mavericks). Specifically I want to count if a number is between 16 and 30.  So far I have tried: codeCOUNTIF(test-array, "&gt;15 AND &gt;= 30")/code with no luck.  Reading from the documentation:     condition: An expression that results in a boolean value of TRUE or FALSE. A condition can contain anything as long as the result from comparing it to a value in test-values can be expressed as TRUE or FALSE.   But I cannot find the correct logical and operator for the condition (tried code&amp;&amp;/code).   <answer112512> If you don't mind a separate column/table for this, you can check if each cell is between 16 and 31 like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AI3db.png" height="300"  Table 2, A1:  precodeIF(x::A1&gt;15,IF(x::A1&lt;31,TRUE,FALSE)) /code/pre  Table 2, A9:  precodeCOUNTIF(A,"=TRUE") /code/pre  <answer112527> You should be able to use codeCOUNTIFS/code instead of codeCOUNTIF/code, using the same range for each test-array/condition pair.   code=COUNTIFS(test-array,"&gt;=16",test-array,"&lt;=30")/code  In the following example, the formula in A8 is code=COUNTIFS(A1:A6,"&gt;=16",A1:A6,"&lt;=30")/code  precode      A     B     C     D     E 1    10 2    15 3    20 4    25 5    30 6    35 7     8     3 /code/pre  <comment132200> Thanks for your answer! But in my case I actually do mind an extra column. <comment132201> thanks for the answer. just a note: I got a syntax error when I used `,` as a sperator for the parameters of `countifs` but `;` seems to work fine. `=COUNTIFS(B2:B38;"15";B2:B38;"=30")`
