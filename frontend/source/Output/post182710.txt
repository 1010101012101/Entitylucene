What kind of SSD is compatible for MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010)? <body> I'm about to buy SSD for my Macbook Pro mid 2010. What would you recommend for the following specification:br  MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010)br Processor: 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duobr Memory: 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3br Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB  <answer182714> Any SSD in a 2.5 inch form factor package will work. Pre-2013 models used standard drives, after that they went ssd-only.  <comment217628> any will do, but be aware that if you plan to run Yosemite, it will make you problems if it is not a Apple disk. <comment217629> Thanks for your answer do I need adaptor or extension? Or it is fit with the slot? <comment217630> Fit in the slot is all it needs. <comment217633> How about the maximum capacity of the SSD?
