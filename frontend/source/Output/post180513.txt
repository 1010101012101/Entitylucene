Quick way to clear Calendar notifications? <body> For some reason, for exchange accounts, if I accept/deny calendar invitations on one computer, it would still stay as an alert on my other computers. The alert would not ask me to accept/reject, instead it would just ask me to dismiss it with an "ok" button. It's super annoying because that means I have to click "ok" for each calendar invite for each computer I have.   Is there a way to fix this or at least a quick way to dismiss all incoming event that have already been accepted?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSugt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181629> Hold down the kbdalt/kbd key when you have the invitations list in view.  All the strongOK/strong buttons will change to strongOk All/strong and all the  strongAccept/strong buttons will change to strongAccept All/strong  Clicking the strongOk All/strong will clear the invitations with just the strongOK All/strong.  The other buttons do not change annoyingly. As I would like strongDecline All/strong  <comment216342> `alt` is useful for activating 'alternative' menu items along the whole system. <comment217336> @CousinCocaine , Correct. That why it was the first thing I tried. :-) <comment254667> Wow, glad to find an answer to this so easily. <comment297889> You made my day! Thank you!
