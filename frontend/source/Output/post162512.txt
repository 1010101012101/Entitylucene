One contact with several numbers - sent messages <body> I have a contact with multiple (two) mobile numbers.  How do i know to which number the sms (text message) was sent? The system did not ask me which telephone number to use.  Is there a way to check it?  <answer162537> When typing in a contact name whilst creating a new message in Messages.app, if the contact sheet for that person has more than one number (or email addresses too) it'll display a list of all numbers. From there you can select which number you'd like to send the message to for that specific contact.  If you've already sent a message and wish to determine what number or email address your using; simply tap on the message - details - the "i" icon. The contact sheet will display the currently used number / email in blue (the other numbers will all remain black).  em(I'm using iOS 8 - different versions of iOS may vary)/em  <answer265140> For iOS if you follow the I symbol in the upper right hand corner of the message screen it will take you to a place where the contact name is given. Click on the name Ã¢ne a list of all their numbers will show up. Next to the number that is related to the message you are inquiring about will have the word "recent" posted next. Apparently recent doesn't mean it is their most recent number like I had first assumed.  <answer268822> Damian is correct above.  Hit "(i)" in the top right corner - tap the person's contact - look for which contact method has "RECENT" next to it. That's the one used in the thread.  <comment190028> If You have iOS 8, tap on Details (upper right corner) and then "i" icon, the number should be highlighted in blue. Just guessing. <comment337595> Hi Justin, welcome to Stack Exchange! Your note about the "recent" text is useful, but might be better suited as an edit to Damian's post.
