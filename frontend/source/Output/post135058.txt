I installed Oracle Java JDK 8 but java command line is still reporting it is version 7 <body> I installed jdk 1.8.0 u5, but the command line java is reporting 1.7:  precode$ java -fullversion java full version "1.7.0_51-b13"  $ which java /usr/bin/java  $ ls -l /usr/bin/java lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  74 Oct 23  2013 /usr/bin/java -&gt; /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java /code/pre  Here is what is installed  precode$ ls -l /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/ total 64 lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   10 Oct 23  2013 1.4 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   10 Oct 23  2013 1.4.2 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   10 Oct 23  2013 1.5 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   10 Oct 23  2013 1.5.0 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   10 Oct 23  2013 1.6 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   10 Oct 23  2013 1.6.0 -&gt; CurrentJDK drwxr-xr-x  8 root  wheel  272 May 13 10:21 A lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    1 Oct 23  2013 Current -&gt; A lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   59 Oct 23  2013 CurrentJDK -&gt; /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents /code/pre  also:  precode$ /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java -fullversion java full version "1.7.0_51-b13" /code/pre  The java control panel applet reports 1.8, but in /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/  Any idea where it went?  <answer135079> Java 7 and Java 8 are installed under code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/code, and to get informations about the installed Java VM's you can use the /usr/libexec/java_home command, which is a link/shortcut to code/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java_home/code.  Some of the command to use are:  code/usr/libexec/java_home -verbose/code will give you all installed versions with path.  code/usr/libexec/java_home -v '1.6*'/code will give you JAVA_HOME of Java 6  code/usr/libexec/java_home -v '1.7*'/code will give you JAVA_HOME of Java 7 (if installed)  code/usr/libexec/java_home -v '1.8*'/code will give you JAVA_HOME of Java 8 (if installed)  And if code/usr/libexec/java_home/code is called without any parameters you should get the current enabled (newest) Java version. If you don't get the newest Java version when code/usr/libexec/java_home/code is called, you can try a restart of your Mac, so that the system reload its current load of the code/usr/bin/java/code link/shortcut to code/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java/code    <answer192180> I had the same problem on OS X Yosemite 10.9.  The problem was solved by installing the Java SE Development Kit 8.  I had installed the other version that is not a SE development kit and it was just working in web browsers, not for the terminal.  <comment160078> How exactly did you install the JDK - Oracle has made it confusion <comment250913> The link to install the JDK in the comment below at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/192180/145778 resolves this issue. <comment255179> I installed the JDK, as you suggested, and everything works now. Many thanks!! <comment283933> Worked for me! been trying to find jdk8 and finally this fixed my issue. thanks <comment331777> I needed to do this, but still had problems because my .bash_profile had JAVA_HOME pointing to /Library/Java/Home, where 1.6 was installed.
