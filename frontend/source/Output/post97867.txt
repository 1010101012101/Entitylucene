Mac Pro won't sleep any more <body> The past couple days, command-option-eject no longer puts my Mac Pro to sleep.  I haven't done any software updates in that time.  No process seems to be doing anything very interesting, or CPU-intensive.  What's stopping my Mac from being able to sleep?  How can I figure out what it is?  <answer97868> Open Terminal application in your utility and type  precodesyslog |grep -i "Wake reason" /code/pre  You shortcuts keys must have changed (with or without your intervention)  Make sure you have no hot corners enabled to keep it awake (System preferences Desktop  hot corners)  <comment114844> I get a few lines that look like: `kernel[0] Debug: Wake reason: EHC2`.  Google suggests that this is USB-related, and I remembered I've been using an old USB mouse recently because the batteries in my Bluetooth mouse died.  Unplugged the USB mouse, and my Mac sleeps again! <comment114845> You are welcome :)
