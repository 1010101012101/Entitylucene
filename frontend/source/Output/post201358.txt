How to configure Finder to let me rename dotfiles? <body> I always have hidden files set to 'visible' in Finder, because I'm a developer and I work with a lot of dotfiles.  But even with this setting, Finder won't let me rename a file beginning with a dot. It also won't let me modify these files by pasting over them etc; it gives an error like "The item “.gitignore” can’t be replaced because it’s invisible." Well, it's not invisible, I can see it, and I want to replace it, and it's mine.  strongI know how to use codemv/code/strong. I am asking about doing this with Finder.  <answer201362> I do not know what version of OS X you're using however I have no problem renaming emdotfiles/em in Finder under OS X 10.8.5. That said, If your using a version of OS X that will not allow you to rename emdotfiles/em in Finder and you do not want to use Terminal and the codemv/code command, then a GUI option you can consider using is muCommander.  <answer201363> On El Capitan (beta build 15A263e), I can not rename dot files and get this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4WR1U.png" alt="You can’t use a name that begins with a dot “.”, because these names are reserved for the system. Please choose another name."  I use the third party tool Transmit to make changes to invisible files and folders. I wish I knew a way to modify Finder to do what you ask, but someone trickier than I will need to step up with instructions if they are known.  <answer201405> You could make an Automator service with a hotkey that pops up and asks for a new name  EDIT:  I did the work for you.  Add it to ~/Library/Services and define a hotkey in System Preferences.  <comment242727> What step specifically do you perform to make invisible files exposed by Finder? What version of Finder / OS X are you running? The error I receive is "**You can’t use a name that begins with a dot “.”, because these names are reserved for the system. Please choose another name.**" <comment242777> Could you expand on this? Perhaps show an example of how you would build such an Automator service?
