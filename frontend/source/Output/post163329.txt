securing boot process against port access but not full physical access <body> Is it possible to secure a Mac Mini (2014) for use in an scenario where users have access to the ports but not full physical access to the computer's internals?  I need to be able to disable cd boot, usb boot, net boot, target mode, and possibly other things, in such a way that the user can't re-enable them via the keyboard during boot.  Potential attackers will not have enough physical access to take the machine apart and change the internal disk, but they will have keyboard, USB port, and power button access.
