Paste clipboard data as plain text Service? <body> Is there a Mac OS X service that takes clipboard data and pastes it as plain text? Or an easy way to create one?  <answer9148> A couple options, gleefully swiped from Mac OS X Hints:  Applescript, converting pasteboard contents to plain text and pasting:   precodetell application "Finder" to set frontApp to (name of 1st process whose frontmost = true) tell application frontApp     activate     set clip to «class ktxt» of ((the clipboard as text) as record)     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "v" using {command down} end tell /code/pre  Shell script, save it in your Scripts folder and chmod 755  precode#!/bin/sh pbpaste | pbcopy osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "v" using {command down}' /code/pre  <comment9670> Thanks for the info. Is there any way to convert the AppleScript to a service in Automator which takes in no input and prints out the text instead of sending Command-V? I'm trying to do this myself, but I'm getting several bugs in the code. <comment9674> I was able to get it to work by converting the shell script to an Automator Service. I was never able to get the AppleScript to work in the same way.
