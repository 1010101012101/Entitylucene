Hard drive backup issue in Mavericks <body> My hard drive had some bad sectors recently, so I backed up, re-formatted, and clean installed Mavericks.  Everything seemed to work fine until couple days ago when I tried to look at some photos I recently imported to iPhoto, things got stuck and sometimes wouldn't move at all for up to 40 seconds, I knew it was a hard drive issue.  I tried to use the os x disk util to verify and repair disk but it all came up green.  when I try to run time machine it transfers REALLY REALLY SLOW and than gets stuck and says backup failed.  what should I do?  <answer122469> I had the same problem as you few years ago.   You definitely have the sympthoms of bad sectors. If you can't backup with Time Machine I advise you to back your data from the finder by yourself and skipping the files that can't be read.   hr  Edit : You won't be able to backup all your files. You can't retrieve the data stored on the dead sectors.   <answer122471> Open Console in your Utility folder.  Type "disk" in the search (Filter) window  Look if you have disk I/O errors.  If you do see them (like a lots of them), your disk is bad, so back up, and get new disk.  <comment142909> I bet on "Disk I/O errors" in Console.app <comment142933> yeah i do see a lot of disk i/o errors. problem is how do i recover my data? i can still boot and use it but i wan to keep all my files. is there any programs like spinrite for mac that keeps reading till it finds something so i can recover and replace drive? <comment142935> You won't be able to backup all your files.
