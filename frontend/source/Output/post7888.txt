Recieving Error Code 60 connecting iCal to OS X Server <body> I have a problem with my Mac mini running OS X Server 10.6.6. I want to use iCal and Address Book on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro.  ol liI started the two services without SSL./li liI installed port forwarding on my router: 8008, 8800, 8843, 8443/li liI added the account on my iPhone and iPad/li /ol  But now, on my iPad and Mac I get the error: strongCode 60/strong.  What did I do wrong?  <answer10820> This may help:  ol liOpen iCal on your client computer  Preferences/li liGo to the Accounts tab/li liGo to Server Settings tab/li liMake sure there is a port number entered. It should match the port number being used by the iCal server. Originally, this setting was on "Auto" and it worked fine. The "Auto" option no longer works. Also, be sure to check "Use SSL" if you are doing so. (In my setup, I have it on port 8443, with SSL on.) /li /ol  Also make sure everything has been updated.
