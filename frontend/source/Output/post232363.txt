Boot Camp says there is a partition when there isnt one <body> My boot camp is keeping me from using it because it says there is more than one partition (which i may or may not have made in the past). When i go into the disk utility it only shows the internal hard drive and no other partitions that I can find. How would I go about resetting this or removing this partition that I cant find?  <comment283926> Open the Terminal application and enter the command `diskutil list`. This will show all partitions including any hidden ones. It usually is useful to also add the output from the commands `sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0` and `sudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0`. These two commands may ask for your login password. This is normal. None of the commands will change your computer. Edit your question and add the output from the commands. Also, add model/year of your Mac, the version of OS X and the version of Windows you want to install.
