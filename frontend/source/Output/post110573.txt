Sound interference on Macbook Pro when connected to network via ethernet <body> I have discovered that when My Macbook Pro (Early 2011, Mountain Lion 10.8.5) has an active ethernet connection, there is audible audio static/interference via the headphone socket.  The ethernet connection comes via a router which in turn is connected to ethernet via powerline. The audio interference is not there when I connect to the network via WIFI.  I would rather have an ethernet connection so am wondering if there is anything I can do to prevent this interference?  Switching off the powerline adapter at the wall instantly stops the static / interference so I'm pretty sure it is related to that.  <comment130225> Starting from your MBP, there is an Ethernet cable going to a power adapter plugged into a wall socket. There is also a thin headphone cable going to your headphone. Did I understood your local cabling correctly? If yes, how far are these 2 cables from each other? <comment130226> MBP - ethernet cable - router - ethernet cable2 - powerline adapter - wallsocket. The cables are near to each other. It would not be practical to have that much distance between them due to the proximity of the headphone and ethernet ports. <comment130234> Does only unplugging the Ethernet cable at the MBP socket suppress the interference? <comment130235> Put this clearer description of your cabling in your original post.
