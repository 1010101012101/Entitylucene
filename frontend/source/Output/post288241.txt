Email font is too small <body> When I send email from Mail and someone opens it on their iPhone, the font is microscopic and unreadable. My bosses have quit reading my emails, stating it is my problem and I must get it fixed.   I can not find anyone else with this issue.   Version 10.11.6 OS X EL Capitan. Mail version Version 9.3  <comment364017> What are the defaults of a new mail (after hitting the "compose new message" button)? plain text/formatted text? If formatted text hit the A button at the top and check the default font and its size!
