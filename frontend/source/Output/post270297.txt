How to change Console.app log queries' time format <body> I'd like to change the time format from 12 to 24 hours in the log queries.  The logs themselves are already in 24-hour, but the queries show in 12-hour format.  I checked codeasl.conf/code's codeman/code page but I couldn't find an option, nor did perusing the actual file at code/private/etc/asl.conf/code.  I also checked the default All Messages query file and a custom one, to no avail, at code/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/Contents/Resources/ASLQueries/All Messages.aslquery/code.  Make sure you select codeView/codecodeShow Milliseconds/code to reproduce it, which seems to override the setting codeMedium/code in codeSystem Preferences/codecodeLanguage &amp; Text/codecodeRegion/codecodeTimes/codecodeCustomizeâ€¦/code.  I use codeConsole.app/code v10.8 on Mountain Lion.  <answer270575> For El Capitan - macOS 10.11.6  Go to System Preferences-Language and Region and choose the Time Format.  Changing it to non 24hr seemed to give a quick response in Console but changing back seemed to need a restart of Console.app  <comment339837> Have you an example query - all of my entries are in 24hr format. ALso what are your date and time settings in Preferences <comment339838> If you can live with working on the command line, have a log at `man syslog`. You can conveniently search for messages, and format them how you like. Using e.g. `syslog -F '$((Time)(sec)) $Host $(Sender)[$(PID)] $((Level)(str)): $Message'` will print the time in seconds (epoch). <comment339850> What's your 24hour clock setting in system preferences - language & region? <comment339851> ntp server is irrelevant here <comment340023> @Mark, check `View``Show Milliseconds` to reproduce it. <comment340028> As I said above, `View``Show Milliseconds` seems to override those settings. <comment340036> Not for me    ..... and you have not mentioned what state the toggle I mentioned is you have mentioned something else <comment340045> I use `Console.app` v10.8. And in System Preferences the pane is `Language & Text`, there's no `Time Format` toggle. <comment340048> That needs to go in the question I am on 10.11.6 <comment340076> Could you post the key that's written to whatever the plist for System Preferences in El Capitan is called and saved? In 10.8 is `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist`.
