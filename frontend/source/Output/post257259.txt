What cache files are deleted during Safe Boot? <body> According to https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201262 a safe boot will perform the following:     ul   liVerifies your startup disk, and attempts to repair directory issues if needed/li   liLoads only required kernel extensions/li   liPrevents Startup Items and Login Items from opening automatically/li   liDisables user-installed fonts /li   liDeletes font caches, Kernel cache and other system cache files/li   /ul   Apple as usual is somewhat vague.  Does anyone have a list of the exact cache files deleted and where to find them?  Why I need this:  I have two labs of iMacs where after a week or so of student use, they will freeze and when rebooted get stuck at 100% of the progress bar. About 80% of the time a safe boot fixes them (the remaining I usually end up wiping).  I've looked at /Library/Caches and /System/Library/Caches before and after a safe boot and there appears to be no change.    Any clues what cache files I should look at next?  If I can pinpoint the culprit, I can design a manual purge of this file and hopefully keep my uptime of these machines beyond a week.  <comment321201> Forgot to include, all machines are currently running 10.11.6 <comment323178> I seem to have found a resolution to my specific problem, but I'd like to keep this question open as it seems beneficial if someone could answer it.
