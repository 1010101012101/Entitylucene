I-beam cursor color in Mavericks's terminal <body> After upgrading to Mavericks the I-beam cursor in the terminal became less visible (see screenshot, I am using the emPro/em profile with a dark background)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8ZwD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to change the cursor's color or to make it more visible? In the preferences I only managed to change the color of the strongtext/strong cursor.  <answer111924> It looks like it was possible before Mavericks by editing  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/ShadowedIBeam.tiff /code/pre  I've tried changing that file, but it is never reflected in Terminal. I'd love to change this as I have a dark background color too.   <answer117839> Same for me: Tried to edit ShadowedIBeam.tiff, with GIMP, but no effects whatsoever. What I did notice (with the file command). The original is a big-endian tiff, my modified version is a little-endian .tiff. In general I do know what little and big-endian is about, bu why would Apple distribute big-endian files on a little-endian (Intel!) machine??  I think it would be wise if Apple would an option to invert the colour of the I-Beam, nothing fancy or difficult about that!  <answer148257> This answer on superuser provides a solution where he has written an app available on github to customise the cursor to allow it to work with all apps.  I had been using iTerm for years but it did bug me where the terminal output could sometimes behave erratic I switched back to Terminal around snow-leopard or some-time after native terminal provided tab support.  <answer182045> You can do this with Mousescape: https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape/releases  If you use  Max Rudberg's Svansl√∂s cursors, the I-Beam shows up nicely on a black background with the caveat that it gives you some other kind of weird flashy cursors.  I believe you can create your own if you have the interest.  <answer186286> pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codedefaults write com.apple.Terminal UseCustomIBeamCursor -bool YES /code/pre  <answer188946> Edit the cursor tiff image inside the Terminal App with for example Image editor (freeware)   precodeTerminal.app/Contents/Resources/ShadowedIBeam.tiff /code/pre  and then run  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal UseCustomIBeamCursor -bool YES /code/pre  <answer209381> Based on the steps from Christian:     Edit the cursor tiff image inside the Terminal App with for example Image editor (freeware)  precodeTerminal.app/Contents/Resources/ShadowedIBeam.tiff /code/pre      and then run  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal UseCustomIBeamCursor -bool YES /code/pre   I used GIMP to accomplish this  ol liYou can use GIMP to edit if desired (did this successfully)/li liClick "open" in GIMP, Import from TIFF screen pops up/li liOn Import Pop-Up, click "Select All" and open as "Layers -- now "import"/li liDo NOT change the RGB color profile, click "keep"/li liPick one of the layers to keep (big or small depending on what you want); delete the other layer/li liClick on the "Colors" menu tab at the top of the screen and then click "Invert"/li liClick on "File" and then "Export" -- export as "TIFF" file, save this copy in your documents and name it correctly codeShadowedIBeam.tiff/code/li liBEFORE YOU OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL make a copy of it and also put this in your documents folder -- name it codeShadowedIBeam.backup.tiff/code/li licodecp /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/ShadowedIBeam.tiff ~/Documents/code/li liCopy the newly created Cursor file to the specified location, this step will overwrite the file inside the Terminal.app  precodesudo cp ShadowedIBeam.tiff /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/ /code/pre/li liFinally set the flag for Terminal.app to use a custom cursor  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal UseCustomIBeamCursor -bool YES /code/pre/li /ol  If the change doesn't take effect immediately (or after clicking around) then simply close Terminal app completely (CMD + Q) and then reopen Terminal.app  (tested on Yosemite 10.10.5)  <answer212950> As many have mentioned above, I did this -   ol liTake a backup of existing ShadowedIBeam.tiff  precodecp Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/ShadowedIBeam.tiff Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/ShadowedIBeam.orig.tiff /code/pre/li liMake your own cursor .... or, if you are a lazy one, just use this one - img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DENRH.png" alt="newShadowedIBeam.png" (credit: Chris Dragon and his answer on this thread)/li liThen copy it over the original ShadowedIBeam.tiff  precodesudo cp ~/Downloads/TIbeam.tiff Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/ShadowedIBeam.tiff /code/pre/li liAnd finally, run this -   precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal UseCustomIBeamCursor -bool YES /code/pre/li /ol  If you were as lucky as I was, you should have your eyes profusely thanking you in sheer gratitude!  <comment126330> I don't think this is possible, since you would have to change to OS cursor. <comment137571> Welcome to Ask Different!

Completely customizable. <comment142028> I think the endian analysis is worth keeping - even describing how to determine endian-ness of a tiff would be worth a bounty IMO. <comment156867> @DavidLively Finally, a solution that actually works! I've been looking for this for years. I've always been looking to change the cursor. It never occurred to me just to get a better terminal app. Thank you. <comment171656> @DavidLively please make that a answer so we can close this successfully. <comment219877> The cursor is different but not really readable <comment248172> I just tried Christian's answer on Mavericks and it worked. The key seems to have been that I used Photoshop to edit the .tiff, rather than GIMP or whatever. <comment262461> The image you have linked to is a PNG file. I exported that as TIFF in Preview.app and followed the rest of your instructions. The cursor was not picked up on OS X 10.10.5 (14F27) <comment262463> The image embedded in the post is a .png, but the link ("this one") is for a .tiff, and works for me. <comment274165> Running Yosemite. Worked great. Thanks. Note: If you don't copy over the existing file, but do a `rm` and `mv`, then you'll need to set the correct owner and permissions: `sudo chown root:wheel ShadowedIBeam.tiff` and `sudo chmod 644 ShadowedIBeam.tiff`
