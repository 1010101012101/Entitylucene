Pronouncing names in different languages with Siri <body> When I'm using Siri in one language, Siri can't recognize names in another language.  Example:   using Siri in English and asking to play a song whose band's name is in Spanish or French.  Siri understands the first part in English, like code"Hey Siri, play a song by..."/code but then if the band or artist's name is typically pronounced in a French way, Siri doesn't understand and tries to interpret the name as an existing English word and fails.  Is there a specific way to ask Siri for this?  <comment324092> My partner is Hungarian, we live in the UK... I just learned to Anglicise pronunciation of her name & related items so Siri groks it. Easier than trying to teach her any/all "foreign" pronunciations. Put an "H" on Hugo, herb etc etc. [reminds me of the old PG Tips advert from the 70's... "Avez vous un cuppa"] - Siri doesn't hear 'accents' just 'words'.
