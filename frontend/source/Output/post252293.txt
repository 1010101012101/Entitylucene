What is causing my browsers to require multiple clicks? <body> As of about a few weeks ago, I'm finding that I need to often (not always) click on links multiple times before they activate in my web browsers.  The details:  ul liit happens in both Chrome and Safari/li lisometimes it's two clicks, sometimes 3, sometimes more/li liit's not just web content, but the browser UI as well (switching tabs, closing tabs, etc)/li liIt's not all the time. Sometimes things work on first click, sometimes they don't. It seems pretty random./li liother software doesn't seem affected/li liI haven't added any new plugins to the browsers./li /ul  Any theories as to what is going on? Googling seems to indicate that this happened may years ago due to a Flash plugin issue, but I don't have any flash plugins anymore. Anyone else having this issue? Known problem with a recent OSX update?  <comment313933> Have you tried restarting the browsers as well as your computer? This seems more like a UI lag than a outright bug. <comment313950> It's not a UI lag that I can tell (that's an issue at times too) But this has been happening even after a fresh reboot. <comment313951> Have you checked your mouse/trackpad settings? <comment313952> @IronCraftMan no, though not sure what I'd check there. It's a problem only with the two web browsers mentioned. All my other apps seem OK.
