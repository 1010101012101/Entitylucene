How to add icons to iTerm2? <body> I've been looking into making my terminal more visually expressive. So far I've found , and learnt how to import themes and customize color schemes, but I was wondering how people get these cool icons and visual modifications as seen in these images. Can anyone provide me with some useful links?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zPXfB.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E4zcr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer152276> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9VKwO.png" alt="enter image description here"  oh-my-zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.  It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shoutâ€¦  Github Project  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRgNs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Themes  <answer152369> The first prompt you show a picture of looks like a customized version of a powerline oh-my-zsh theme. It requires oh-my-zsh. There is also a version that supports bash, zsh, and fish.   To use those, you need a Powerline-patched font.   Your second screenshot comes from dracula-theme, a color scheme and prompt for lots of different editors plus oh-my-zsh.   Personally, I would not recommend oh-my-zsh, as in my experience it was kind of slow and heavy. I created my own bash prompt using Powerline symbols, but milkbikis/powerline-shell is probably the best one to use.   <comment179185> Does that shell include the nice VCS branch arrow ui shown in my second screenshot? <comment179186> Yes I think so.
