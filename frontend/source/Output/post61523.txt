Which application can be recommended to save a whole site recursively off line? <body> I have a tourist web site I want to archive for off line view on my iPad.  I want to crawl and save it in 2nd and 3rd level depth.  Which application can be recommended to save a whole site recursively off line?  <answer61529> There's an app called SiteSucker that allows you to download websites. I haven't tried the iOS version, but used the desktop version extensively and happily with basic websites that I used to support/create. There were some issues with PHP sites where the resource files wouldn't come down, just the pages themselves would get retrieved.  <answer61530> SiteSucker is a great tool for this. They have both a Mac version, and a iOS version. I have used the Mac client a while ago.  If you want to do this on the computer, 'wget' is a great tool, and the code-m/code flag will help you mirror the site to a local directory. You may have to install codewget/code through homebrew or another similar tool.  <answer269411> Offline pages and Offline page pro are also the apps which can be installed on iPad and where you can save the entire Website and view it offline.
