Choose display when doing a screen capture with external display <body> I have a Macbook with an external display. I use both displays and when I do a screen capture (⌘ + ⇧ + 3) I get two files on the desktop, one for each display. Is there a way to choose which display to grab the screenshot from when doing the screen capture?  <answer92186> You might use ⇧⌘4 (Save picture of selected area as a file) and just drag the selection around one display.  screencapture -m only captures the main display:  precode-m      Only capture the main monitor, undefined if -i is set. /code/pre  I don't know if -S supposed to capture the display of the selected window, but options like -Sw or -SW only seemed to capture the selected window.  precode-S      In window capture mode, capture the screen instead of the window. -w      Only allow window selection mode. -W      Start interaction in window selection mode. /code/pre  -R (rect) captures a specified area:  precodescreencapture -R0,0,1920,1080 /tmp/screencapture.png /code/pre  <answer92223> Thanks to Lauri Ranta's answer, I made a Keyboard Maestro shortcut. I thought I'd share it so that other people can re-use it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VWmGF.png" alt=""
