Converting to .PDF and keeping original name -- what am I doing wrong? <body> I have been piecing together what little I have learned of Automator along with pieces I've found in tutorials, but cannot seem to get this to work! If I test this as a workflow using a file from "strongGet specified finder items/strong" it works fine, but once I try to make a droplet or service out of it, it does nothing! Can anyone tell me what I'm missing here? I would use a screenshot of my workflow but I can't upload an image for some reason.  strongSet Value of Variable/strongbr "File"br strongRun Shell Script/strong (bin/bash/, as argument)       name=codebasename "$1"/codebr echo ${name%.*}br   strongSet Value of Variable/strongbr "Name"br strongGet Value of Variable/strong br "File"br strongNew PDF from Images/strongbr emoutput/em: /New Filesbr emName/em: "new"br strongRename Finder Items: Name Single Item/strongbr emName:/em base name only emto:/em (variable) Namebr  <comment286813> First of all you didn't state what you selected as the type of Automator object, e.g. Workflow, Application, Service, etc. Secondly, not sure how you can consider this works because as written it produces a file named new.pdf, not the basename (sans the extension of the source file) .pdf. Anyway, in your Run Shell Script, change `name=basename "$1"` to `name="$(basename "$1")"` and `echo ${name%.*}` to `echo "${name%.*}"` and see if that fixes your issue.  The command substitution `"$(...)"` part is what should fix it.  The double-quotes added to both variables are good programming practices. <comment286814> Continued from previous comment... The double-quotes added to both variables are good programming practices even when the filename doesn't contain spaces and keeps from word splitting when the filename does have spaces. <comment287058> thank you so much for your help @user3439894 this works great. I had said in my original post I am testing it as a workflow and trying to make it into a service or droplet. Thank you so much! <comment287059> Yes, I reread the post afterwards and saw that however it was too late to edit the comment, sorry. :)
