Mac says password is wrong but it's right. I have to enter it twice to start Mac every time. How could I solve it? <body> Mac says password is wrong, but is right, and wants me to enter it again to start Mac every time. My password is used to be characters and numbers. I changed my password into all numbers but it doesn't work.  How could I solve it?  Thanks.  <answer281926> If you are talking about the user password and you are locked out of your mac, you can try the following:  ol liReboot into the Recovery Drive by choosing the ‘Apple‘ menu  Restart, hold down the ‘command’ + ‘r’ keys on the keyboard during the start up process, when you see the start up screen you can let go. When the machine boots eventually you will see the macOS or OS X Utilities screen./li liGo to the Utilites menu and select Terminal/li liAt the prompt type ‘resetpassword’ (hit enter)/li liReset your password/li /ol  Keep in mind that this deletes your keychain, so your saved passwords are lost  <comment354870> Just checking: Are you talking about your user account password, or a firmware password? <comment354891> From what the OP says it seems they can log in or boot up, but they have to enter the password twice. <comment355012> Or is it a Firevault password? <comment355257> Thanks for your reply. It's account password. <comment355258> Sorry, I have to apologize. I don't know why, it suddenly become normal. I don't know if it would happen again, but it seems good today. Thanks for your answer.
