Macbook pro locked/disabled <body> My Macbook pro got disabled. I tried to go into the recovery mode using cmd+R and internet recovery mode using cmd+opt+R. Both ask for my firmware password, and when I enter the password,although correct, it takes me back to disabled screen. Find my Iphone app says my Macbook is locked.In addition I tried to reinstall OS through bootable installer but that too takes me back to the disabled screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CCuRY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer293673> You can do the startup that takes you to disk utility to get to terminal and type in the terminal command to reset your login password.   <answer293706> This lock is by design. See https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my-iphone/ and especially the Mac link at the bottom.   You now have a firmware password on that Mac preventing you from changing the OS to boot from other sources. You can either enter the passcode that was created to lock the hardware or follow the normal process when you forget a firmware password by seeking authorized service.   ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455/li /ul  <comment370580> What do you mean by your macbook is disabled? Please send a screenshot of what’s showing on your computer. <comment370619> The question is about the *firmware* password, not the user account password. <comment370627> As i mentioned i cant startup into that mode <comment370630> When you say “got disabled” that means someone signed in to the same iCloud account as was entered as an admin user on that Mac and chose a specific numeric passcode. Was that not you? If not, I would get control of iCloud first - then worry about the firmware password. <comment370690> I tried entering the firmware password but I am still stuck in this loop
