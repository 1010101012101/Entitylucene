How to solve error 4SNS/1/40000000:VDOR-18.507? <body> I've been experiencing issues with my old MacBook Pro, early 2011, A1297.   ol liIt started showing some vertical stripes, but resetting the PRAM did help./li liSome time later it ran into RAM issues, but removing one of the modules resolved this./li liAnd now Apple Hardware Test has detected an error 4SNS/1/40000000:VDOR-18.507/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t41qx.jpg" alt="error 4SNS/1/40000000:VDOR-18.507"  In addition to the error, the MBP feels hot and I can barely hear the fan. I think they should run much faster. I am guessing it is some temperature or fan sensor.  I tried to ask on Apple's official forum, but it displays Access Denied, so I gave it up.  How can I fix the issue?  <answer276676> It is definitely either a sensor error and/or hardware problem that is triggering the sensor.  In a situation such as this you really need to take it to an Apple Store or authorised service repairer. If you have a Genius Bar near you, make an appointment there as they won't charge you for just a diagnosis.  strongReset the SMC/strong  Here are the steps for resetting the SMC on your particular MacBook Pro.

Will it work? <comment348287> Well, that really depends on what the root cause of the problem is. There's no way for me (or anyone here) to give you a definite answer. However, you could reset the SMC to see if that makes any difference to the fans and/or heat. I've updated my answer with the steps for doing this. <comment348290> I tried to reset SMC and PRAM. It didn't help. Thank you for updating the question. English is not my native language and I'm not good at it. I truly appreciate your help. It is all sounds like some hardware fault. I'm handy man, I used to fix some simple devices like radio. But MacBook is far more advanced and there is no schematic and I don't have much equipment to walk over the board and see all signals. Anyway it is all proprietary.
