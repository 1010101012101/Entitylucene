Safari address bar complete URL with keyboard shortcut <body> Does Safari in OS X have a keyboard shortcut to complete a URL in the same fashion that Chrome does?  I'd like to be able to type in an incomplete address like codeaskdifferent/code, press a key combo, and have Safari prefix it with codewww./code and suffix with code.com/code, and automatically navigate to that URL.  I've tried all various combination of kbdfn/kbd, kbdcontrol/kbd, kbdoption/kbd,kbdcommand/kbd, and kbdreturn/kbd. Most of them will open your search in a new tab.  Does Safari support this, and what's the key combo?  <answer139961> Safari doesn't support this out of the box.br You can do this with strongKeyboard Maestro/strong using a macro such as this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UlI20.png" width="480"  <answer154762> Safari 8.0 does: Press and hold the kbdControl/kbd key for a moment while you’re editing the location and you’ll see the search icon turn into an icon indicating that it’s interpreting the input as (part of) a URL instead of performing a search. The label “Search emselected search engine/em” next to your text will change to “Go to Site” and the ‘Go to Site “emyour text/em”’ menu item in the completions list will be selected. Typing kbdControl/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd will navigate there.  By the way, you can use kbdControl/kbd+kbdN/kbd (next) and kbdControl/kbd+kbdP/kbd (previous) to navigate through the completions list using the keyboard. (These are emacs-style navigation key bindings.)  <answer181118> There are many ways to do this.   ol liYou can of course use AutoHotKey(ahk) to define any key combo and mapping you want, which can be used in any text-editing environment, not necessarily in a url bar. So this is an overkill. (Other hotkey apps also work.)/li liSimilar to Internet Explorer(or maybe Chrome, Firefox?), Safari also uses ctrl+enter(or return) as a shortcut to navigate to a website, which is illustrated in Chris Page's answer. However, a slight difference is that, in Safari, you have to hold the ctrl key for a moment(as mentioned in Chris Page's answer), while in Internet Explorer, you can simply hit ctrl+enter immediately after you type the address name, say, you type 'nba' in url bar, then hit ctrl+enter(no pause is needed), it will automatically navigate to www.nba.com . In fact, this shortcut can be found in Internet Explorer's help document./li /ol  <answer272277> There IS a way - in Safari Version 10.0.3 at least.  Type a slash ("/") after the domain name. As in,  precodesemiconducted/&lt;enter&gt; /code/pre  will resolve to www.semiconducted.com  Voila!
