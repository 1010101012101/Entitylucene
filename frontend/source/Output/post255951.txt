How do I reduce the size of my photo Library using iCloud photo library? <body> I ran out of space on my mac. Most of my local HD is used up with photos, so I purchased an iCloud Photo Library plan. I selected "Optimise Mac Storage" option in the settings.  I waited for all the photos to upload. Then checked my HD space. Unfortunately, I still have only 20 GB free.  I want to clear all the photos out from my local Mac (especially the originals). Can I do something clever like removing the "Masters" folder? Or running a command that tells the photos app to remove all "originals"?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WkIF.png" alt="Size of my photos folder"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BOyG.png" alt="Here are my settings"  EDIT : This question is different from the related question about how to only use the iCloud Photo Library. I want to store my photos locally, but I don't want to store ANY large photo files, therefore reducing the size of the local library. It's a different question.  <comment319283> I added an EDIT that shows how this question is different from http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/255415/how-to-store-icloud-photo-library-only-in-the-cloud <comment319311> iCloud Photo is an all-or-nothing offering, so the answers to the linked question apply to your situation as well.
