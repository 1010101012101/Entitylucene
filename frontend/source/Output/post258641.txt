contact import/export <body> I've got Verizon service with 3 devices, I've got an iTunes account. 2 of the devices are mine. I must keep the child on my iTunes account for 'find the iphone' app. Is there a way to share my contact list from device to device within my account without it being accessed by the child?  <answer258647> Family Sharing, as suggested by @Tetsujin, is a perfect option for a child device.br It allows you to:  ul liShare purchases/li liSet limits to purchases made by the child, or let they ask for purchases and approve remotely/li liShare Apple Music or music purchased from Apple/li liShare and see other family member's location on Messages or Find My Friends/li liUse Find My iPhone for all devices/li liActivate Restrictions on iOS and Parental control on macOS/li liShare calendars and Photos Albums /li /ul  And it lets you fully sync your own data between your devices, because the accounts are independent.  <comment323391> Why 'must' you use the same account? Use [Family Sharing](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201060)  instead. <comment323458> I use Family Sharing for myself and my two kids. It's a wonderful way to keep things separate, but still integrated in a way. This really is a great suggestion.
