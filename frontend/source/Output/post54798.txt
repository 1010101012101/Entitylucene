OS X Color matching on dual displays <body> I have an iMac and a second display - an LG 24" panel.  Using any colour picker (eg Digital Color Meter) on strongexactly the same colour/strong gives a different result depending on which screen I pick the colour from.  As an example - on a web page, the body colour is defined as code#c00202/code.  On the iMac's display, the colour picker gives me the expected value of code#c00202/code, but on my other display, I get a different value - in this case code#bc0007/code. If I change the display profile. I get a different value.  I get what's going on, but is there any way of just making the colour picker return the defined colour - it seems crazy that I'll get a different value depending on which screen I'm using.  <answer54802> When selecting "Display native values", the actual value depends on the color profile of the monitor, which explains the difference.  Forcing a single profile, like sRGB, should give the same result across different screens.  <comment62797> ok - obvious with hindsight! thanks. <comment224986> Here it doesn't. The color picker gives me completely different values with sRGB selected, depending on which screen the window/cursor is in.
