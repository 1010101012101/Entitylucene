MacBook Pro will not detect monitor until the cord is unplugged/replugged from the monitor itself <body> My MacBook Pro 2017 (running macOS Sierra 10.12.5) won't detect my monitor until I've unplugged and replugged the cord ONLY into the monitor itself. The cord is a USB-C to HDMI cord.  strongThings I've tried that haven't worked:/strong Turning the monitor off/on, opening/closing the Mac with the cord in.  Anyone have any thoughts on how I could fix this issue? At the moment every time I plug my Mac into my monitor I have to pull my monitor to the front of my desk and unplug/replug the cord into the monitor.  <comment363830> Does this problem exist with other monitors? <comment363832> @Jackson1442 hm, seems to be only this monitor (just checked with another one). <comment363834> It looks like this is a problem with the monitor itself.Just to confirm, you are using the same cord and setup with the other monitor you tried? <comment363835> @Jackson1442 yeah, same cord. Definitely looking like it's an issue with the monitor. <comment363836> can you try plugging a different computer into the monitor? Preferably Windows, using USB C
