How to make a bootable disk from an image with Toast? <body> I read contradictory informations, some say it's possible, some say it's not  and Apple's Disk Utility is required.br I prefer to use Roxio Toast for its multi-purpose but I don't want to waste blank disks.br So is it possible and if yes how to make a bootable disk (DVD or CD) from an image (dmg, iso, toast, cdr...) ?br emI also heard that it must be burnt at the slowest speed./em  <answer40937> Go to Copy  From Image File, put an image (dmg, iso, toast, cdr...) into the Toast. Burn.  <answer40943> In my experience, it's simpler, cheaper and faster to use Disk Utility for bootable images.  <answer41629> strongToast:/strong  ol li"Do not mount the Disk Image first!"/li liLaunch "Toast.app"/li liClick "Data" icon (upper left) and choose strongISO 9660/strong/li liSelect "Copy" icon (upper left) and choose strongImage File/strong/li liClick "Select" and "Choose a Disk Image File" from the dialog (do not drag and drop)./li liClick "Burn" et voil√†./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dyqr.jpg" alt="v2Toast.app"  hr  strongDisk Utility:/strong   ol liLaunch "Disk Utility.app"/li liClick "Burn" icon (upper left)/li li"Select image to burn" from the dialog (do not drag and drop)./li liInsert CD / DVD/li liClick "Burn" using the dialog./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gaFr7.png" alt="v2DiskUtility.app"  hr  strongMost effective Option:/strong  ol liLaunch "Terminal.app"/li liUse the following command(s).
