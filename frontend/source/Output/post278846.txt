WD Passport Ultra can't mount on Mac, flashing lights, but can be read on Windows. What is broken? <body> Update:  After about 3 weeks. I plugged in again into my MacBook and left it there. After more than an hour I came back and the drive showed up on my Mac again.  (So somehow the problem got fixed.)  I ran First Aid on Mac's Disk Utility. It says the drive appears to be OK. So I don't know what fixed it exactly.  hr  strongProblem:/strong   When I plug my WD Passport Ultra 4TB external hard drive WDBBKD0040BBK-0A (with 2TB of family photos) into my MacBook Pro it has fast flashing of light and can't be mounted. It can be read on a Windows laptop (after Windows automatically fixed an error).  I tried opening up Disk Utility on my Mac, but it just spins forever trying to mount the external hard drive. Nothing ever shows up on Disk Utility.  strongHow it broke:/strong  The WD Passport Ultra was plugged into my MacBook on battery. I was not actively reading or writing to the external hard drive, but it did have a list of directories open (no individual photo files, but just the directory names).  The battery ran out.   When I charged up my Mac again it says that the disk was not ejected properly. Ever since that my WD hard drive has the flashing problem and can't be mounted on my Mac.  I tried changing the Mac laptop, changing the USB cord, same problem.  I then plugged in my WD hard drive to a Windows laptop. It says that it detected an error and had the option of automatically fixing it. I clicked "Start" and let it ran, but it didn't have a progress bar and just had a "Cancel" button. After running for 3-5 minutes, my mom came in and unplugged the external hard drive forcefully (I yelled at her for doing that). We tried plugging it into the Windows laptop again, and my files and photos could be read!!  But it still can't be read on Mac and has the flashing problem.  strongWhy is it like this? What is broken?  How can I test what is broken?/strong  I'm asking because I have had accidentally unplugged other WD external hard drives without ejecting in the past while not writing data, like in this case, but the drives never broke. What is up in this case?  I'm curious if this is something that happens a lot or if it's just a less durable hard drive I got. Because I'm at a point where WD's warranty can give me a new drive to replace it, or I can fix this drive myself.  (I have copied the photos out to a new drive on a Windows machine.)  Because if it is something that happens with the same frequency in all drives, shouldn't I just fix it?  strongWhat is the best free software program on Windows that might potentially fix my problem?/strong  Mac programs are good too if they can actually access it since my Mac can't even mount it.  <answer278857> A good idea would be to run the disk check in Windows to completion.  Plug in the drive, right click the drive in Explorer, select Properties, and then in the Tools tab you'll find "Error-checking". Click "Check Now" and let it scan the whole drive fixing any errors it finds.  <answer282668> You can try the following solution.  In Terminal use the following commands:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  Find your WD HDD identifier.  precodediskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk* diskutil eject /dev/disk* /code/pre  Replace * with your version  After that, you should be able to mount the HDD successfully.  <answer282677> As you have backed up the photos on the windows machine, you should try to use disk utility to fix your drive. There might be a volume mounting error or a format error, which can be fixed by using a function in disk utility  called "first aid".  On your Mac, spotlight search for disk utility. It should show up. When it opens you should see a column on the left with all your disks listed there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iqBJ6.jpg" alt="Here is how it will look"  As you can see, this column has both internal and external drives listed there. Be extremely careful, do not tamper with the internal drives. Go over the list very carefully and select your external drive. It should be fairly obvious which one it is. In your case it should be labeled as something similar to WD passport ultra. If not, you can look at the storage capacity and check if it matches with your disk's (here, 4TB).  Next you need to run first aid. A self explanatory button placed towards the start of the row on the top says first aid. Click and let the magic happen! If it doesn't start right away, you may have a different version of macOS. In the case of this, click on verify the disk. Next, click on repair.  While doing this, please make sure no one yanks the cable out because that will be very, strongvery/strong bad.  If these situations occur:  ol liYou see the outputcodeThe volume "diskname" appears to be OK./code but the problem is not fixed/li /ol  or  ol start="2" liYou see the output codeScan complete. Problems were found, but Disk First Aid cannot repair them./code/li /ol  then you can try to install and use DiskWarrior or try other solutions given on this thread. You could also try reformatting the disk, the steps for which I can edit in later.  @jksoegaard's method looks promising too.  Good luck!  <comment350993> Will it damage or change any photos? <comment351120> @Melissa Potentially, if it finds problems that you let it fix. The risk is very small, normally no data is disturbed. If you're worried about this scenario, take a backup before proceeding. <comment356183> What do you get when you plug in the WD disk and issue the command `diskutil list` in Terminal?  Please post the output to your original question <comment356193> Please check out the answer here -https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/147869/external-hard-disk-showing-input-output-error <comment356574> is the WD disk formatted in NTFS? Or (ex)Fat? <comment356575> It is in exFat. <comment356730> @Melissa if I helped you solve your problem, please also accept the answer :)
