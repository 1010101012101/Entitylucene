How can I back up my app data? <body> I have some app data that I'd like to preserve when the time for a new iPhone rolls around.  This app does not (seem to) have any cloud-syncing functionality.  I regularly sync my iPhone to iTunes via USB on a Macbook Air running OS X 10.5.8.  How can I ensure that this app's data is backed up, so as to re-use it on a new device?  <answer45041> If you take a full backup of your iPhone (right click on it in iTunes and choose strongBack Up/strong) and then restore it to a new phone, all data will be preserved, including apps' data:     iTunes will back up the following information      ul   liContacts* and Contact Favorites (regularly sync contacts to a computer or cloud service such as iCloud to back them up)./li   liApp Store Application data including in-app purchases (except the Application itself, its tmp and Caches folder)./li   listrongApplication settings, preferences, and data, including documents./strong/li   /ul   From iTunes: About iOS backups.  <answer45057> Vlad's answer is good, and he's absolutely right.  An alternative to iTunes would be to use an iOS device browser. This would be especially good if you only wanted to back up emone app's data/em rather than the whole device. Options of these include Phone Disk and PhoneView.  <answer45289> strongTo backup your device to iCloud/strong:  ol liLaunch the strongSettings/strong app./li liGo to strongiCloud  Backup &amp; Storage/strong./li liIf you enable strongiCloud Backup/strong all your data will automatically be backed up each night./li liOr you can press strongBack Up Now/strong to immediately perform a backup of all your data./li /ol  strongTo restore your data to the same phone/strong:  ol liMake sure you backed up and that the backup completed successfully./li liDelete all data on the phone by going to strongSettings  General  Reset  Erase All Content and Settings/strong. -- strongWARNING:/strong This will delete all your data, so make sure you have it backed up, especially anything not syncing to iCloud./li liFollow the steps below for a new phone./li /ol  strongTo restore your data to a new Phone:/strong  ol liDuring the strongSetup Assistant/strong, choose to strongRestore from iCloud Backup/strong./li /ol  strongNotes:/strong  ul liThis will only work if you have less than 5 GB of data on the device.

It takes it all from iCloud. I updated my answer to reflect that. <comment164457> I'd also add CopyTrans Apps if you are on Windows: http://www.copytrans.net/copytransapps.php <comment191495> Is this information still valid? I am currently trying to transfer app data from an old device running iOS 7 to a new device running iOS 8, and it doesn't seem to work. <comment195214> iTunes does not backup *everything*. It leaves out some data for some apps. The only way I know for sure to truly save *all* app data is to use iMazing (formerly named DiskAid) to export each app individually from the old phone and reinstall each app individually on the new phone. <comment226268> Not everything is backed up, according to this [apple document](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204136) <comment292328> Welcome to Ask Different!
