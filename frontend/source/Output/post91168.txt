Command-delete shortcut is not working for me <body> How do you delete a file you have selected in a Finder window, without using the mouse?  kbddelete/kbd doesn't do it.br When I looked it up, I was said that kbdcommand/kbd-kbddelete/kbd is supposed to do it, but it doesn't work for me.  <answer91169> ol liLook into "System Preferences → Keyboard keys" and make sure Command is enabled and mapped to the Cmd key. Check also custom shortcuts in the "Keyboard Shortcuts" panel.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pJt4V.png" alt="Keyboard preference panel of OS X"/li liGo to Finder, select a file, open the "File" menu and see what shortcut is associated to "Move to Trash".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yj9NM.png" alt="&quot;File&quot; menu of Finder"/li /ol  <answer91173> It should work in Finder by default, but did you press the right delete key?  ul liDelete (⌫) is the key that is called backspace on other platforms/li liForward delete (⌦) is the key that is called delete on other platforms/li /ul  <answer94553> I had the same problem. Later I discovered that it was my own mistake. But also a mistake from Apple. On the extended keyboard with numeric pad there is a button says DELETE. (It's not on the short wireless keyboard) This is NOT the delete button for the combination Cmd-Delete. You have to use the button with the backarrow! So Cmd-Backarrow.  <answer130995> tl;dr: If ⌘-delete doesn't work, try ⌘-⌥-delete (command-option-delete) instead.  I had this problem on a new iMac with a standard Apple keyboard running the latest version of OS X (Mavericks 10.9.3 as of this writing). This was driving me crazy because I use ⌘-delete frequently, and I often switch between the iMac and my MacBook Air (running the same version of OS X) on which ⌘-delete works fine. I just discovered by chance and desperation that, for some reason, ⌘-⌥-delete (command-option-delete) emdoes/em work. It's not as good as having the same keystrokes work on both machines, but at least now there's emsome/em keyboard shortcut I can use on the iMac.  UPDATE: For no apparent reason, ⌘-delete has started working.  <answer263269> I experience that before. and my accidental solution is command + delete after that press command + backspace.  <answer272270> I accidentally discovered that Fn + Delete did the job for me in macOS Sierra.  <comment107071> I assume the CMD is enabled in keyboard preferences! <comment149666> good point, it works for me <comment229905> OMG. This is sick! I have spend hours trying to delete a file... and then used the terminal with "rm" <comment286768> I agree !! thanks... ;) that was not obvious at all ! :)
