How can I fix this iPad stuck in the language setup screen? <body> My grandmother got her iPad somehow in this state where it seems to be in language setup, but taps dont work as expected, rather they activate unusual boxes on the screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/spOGg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fix this? Holding down the power and home button for 10 seconds restarted the iPad but the same screen was there. No interaction seems to be doing anything to advance the setup, the boxes that pop up seem to be interfering. The box in the image appears after tapping.   <answer232618> You can put the iPad into recovery mode by plugging it to a computer with iTunes installed. Start with the iPad powered off and hold down the Home button while connecting it to the computer via USB. Hold the Home button down until you see the iTunes connection on the iPad screen.  <answer232619> Hold the power button and only power off and then start iPad  I had the same issue when upgrading to recent firmware and restarting fixed it  In past I hold both power and home both to enter recovery but doing so I had to restore to factory default   <answer232679> Im not sure why my question was downvoted but I figured out the answer. This state is called Voiceover, its an accessibility feature for the visially impaired,   However when used unintentionally by someone who doesnt know the special controls of the Voiceover feature, it can seem that the device simply is not responding to touch.   Recovery mode was not the solution, those answers are all terrible, one simply has to tap buttons to select them then doubletap to click them, navigate to the Voiceover memu under accessibility and turn it off.    <answer239452> Just press the home button 3 times in quick succession and it turns off.  <comment284254> Did you actually swipe the screen? <comment284255> @techraf yes. I'm actually very familliar with the iPad, no normal interaction seemed to work as expected, not that there are many options on that screen.. But the boxes that come up remind me of the voice over feature on OSX. It seemed like some sort of special accessibility feature for disabilities. <comment284256> Trying to swipe creates a box just like the one seen in the center. <comment284257> People voting to close as off-topic: keep in mind that as of the [last time there was a discussion/vote](http://meta.superuser.com/q/5045/117590), tablet questions *including iOS* are allowed. <comment284258> @Bob I would imagine.. Isnt such a question the core of this site? How to handle mainstream software? <comment284259> @Viziionary Seems to be quite a bit of disagreement at the moment over just how much we should accept outside the traditional laptop/desktop Windows/Linux/OS X realm. Will probably revisit on meta sometime soon. At the moment, though, you'll likely get better answers for iOS over at [apple.se] anyway, and you can request a migration (mod-flag your own post) if it does happen to be closed here - don't cross-post manually please. <comment284456> Don't forget to mark your own answer as correct. <comment293865> Welcome to Ask Different.
