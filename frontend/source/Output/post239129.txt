El Capitan Photo Screen Saver no longer works with symbolic links to files <body> In Mountain Lion, I used one of the photo screen savers, and had a directory which contained symbolic links to images in various other folders on my machine.  I recently upgraded to El Capitan, and all the photo screen savers I've tried (Shifting Tiles, etc) fail to load images from the directory containing symbolic links.  They only seem to work when I point the saver at a directory with actual image files in them.  Is there any way around this?  I like to organize my images into directories like:  code/2016  + /2016/Jan  + /2016/Feb  + /2016/Mar ..... /2015  + /2016/Jan  + /2016/Feb  + /2016/Mar /code  So using symbolic links is very handy as I can then have the screen saver use images from many directories, and leave out images that I don't want in the screen saver (but want to retain the file on disk).  <comment293374> What happens if you use _hard_ links instead? <comment293479> Seems to work, thanks!
