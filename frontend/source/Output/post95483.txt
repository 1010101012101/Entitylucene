UTF8 filenames and shell utilities <body> Try the next commands from the terminal:  precodetouch á.txt $ ls á.txt  find .  -name á.txt -print /code/pre  prints nothing.  My Terminal.app settings are utf8 - see here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fD4UL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongThe question: How to achieve to work transprarently (Finder + command line) with UNICODE filenames?/strong  I understand than behind the scene is the different unicode normalization, so:  precode$ echo á.txt | od -bc 0000000   303 241 056 164 170 164 012                                                á  **   .   t   x   t  \n  /code/pre  and when  precode$touch á.txt $ ls *.txt á.txt  $ ls *.txt | od -bc 0000000   141 314 201 056 164 170 164 012                                            a   ́     **   .   t   x   t  \n    /code/pre  strongbut WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?/strong  <answer95485> As you mentioned, characters like á are stored or shown in decomposed form (LATIN SMALL LETTER A + COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT) even though most keyboard layouts insert characters in composed form (LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE).  The format is a variant of NFD where some ranges of characters are not decomposed. See Text Encodings in VFS:     Important: The terms used in this Q&amp;A, precomposed and decomposed, roughly correspond to Unicode Normal Forms C and D, respectively. However, most volume formats do not follow the exact specification for these normal forms. For example, HFS Plus (Mac OS Extended) uses a variant of Normal Form D in which U+2000 through U+2FFF, U+F900 through U+FAFF, and U+2F800 through U+2FAFF are not decomposed (this avoids problems with round trip conversions from old Mac text encodings).   You can convert text to the decomposed format with codeiconv -t utf-8-mac/code:  precode$ touch á $ ls | tr -d '\n' | xxd -p 61cc81 $ printf á | xxd -p c3a1 $ find . -name á $ find . -name $(iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8-mac &lt;&lt;&lt; á) ./á /code/pre
