Export iPad2 Slideshow with Origami Transitions <body> I'm trying to export a slideshow from my iPad2. I can email or share single photos, of course, but how do you share or export a slideshow? I especially want to retain the origami transition effect to share on YouTube or export to iMove. Is there a way? Or a program that creates the origami effect? Thanks for your help.  <answer79307> I don't know if you can do this with the iOS iPhoto app, so I suggest you check out iPhoto for OS X. You have the ability to create slideshows, set origami as the theme and then export them to video. I do it all the time &amp; it works like a charm.  I'm using iPhoto '11 v. 9.2.3.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CE8HT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
