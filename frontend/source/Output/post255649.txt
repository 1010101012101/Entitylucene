Printer Driver in macOS Sierra <body> I'm currently trying to install a Dell 1130n Printer Driver on macOS Sierra.  Upon installation, the installer displays this message:     Error opening file: libscmssc.dylib   1008:6, -35 Drive not found   This file is located in a folder in the same directory as the installation file.  I have disabled some security settings in macOS Sierra by running a line of code in Terminal, which I thought might have caused that issue:  precodesudo spctl --master-disable /code/pre  But it does not appear to have any effect on the installer.  Any ideas?  <answer255678> Yeah, that installer is from 2011 so it may not work anymore... The following site suggests they dropped support for it in 10.10:  http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/SLN294375/EN  That being said, does it work if you select a generic driver?  Looks like people have used the SAMSUNG ML-191x 252x SERIES driver with success previously:  http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/peripherals/f/3528/t/19450382  <comment318656> This appears to work for now! Thank you so much, I'll report back if I have any other difficulties.  The installer from 2011 did work on OSX El Capitan so I'm unsure on why it doesn't work on macOS Sierra.
