Password protect removal of apps on iOS <body> I have had instances of people deleting my applications (purposedly or unpurposedly) and it's a real annoyance to get them back, plus you lose all of your data.  Is there a way to password protect the removal of applications, maybe through the use of a Cydia tweak?  <answer25540> No need for a jailbreak. Simply go into SettingsGeneralRestrictions and don't allow "Deleting Apps". Restrictions are protected using a password just like your lock passcode (although it can be a different code if you would like).  <comment28966> I'm not really convinced by this way of doing things: it makes it a lot harder for me to actually delete something when I have to. <comment29011> This answers your question exactly. It passcode protects deletions. Making it harder to delete apps is the point of your question and this answer. Why are you "not convinced"? <comment29748> Sorry, I didn't express myself properly: if I actually need to delete something I'm forced to go in the settings to disable the protection, delete the app and turn the protection back on. It takes a lot of time <comment124500> I'm interested in a more granular response here. Basically looking at how to password protect removal of one specific application. Is this possible in iOS?
