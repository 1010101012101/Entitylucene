How can I delete saved commands from Terminal? <body> As all of you know, Mac OS X stores all commands that run from Terminal in Terminal itself, however, I want to delete (for example) the last 3 commands from the terminal. How can I do this?  <answer34300> It's not a Mac OS feature but a shell feature. Assuming that you are using bash (the default):  ul lithe command history is stored in memory and persisted in a file (usually code~/.bash_history/code)/li liyou can list and edit the history with the codehistory/code command/li /ul  With codeman bash/code (in the codeSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS/code section) you will find the description of the different options.  You can:  ul lilist the history entries  precode$ history /code/pre/li lidelete the whole history  precode$ history -c /code/pre/li lidelete a given entry  precode$ history -d offset /code/pre/li /ul  <answer34301> Mac OS does not store anything anywhere.  codebash/code, which is the shell that is run in the terminal, does store the command history.  The terminal command history is stored in a hidden file in your user directory called code.bash_history/code  This means the file is: code/Users/{username}/.bash_history/code  You have to enable "Show System Files" to see it (from the "View" menu in finder).  The file is just a textual list of everything you type in the shell. You can open it in TextEdit, or your editor of choice.  hr  You should probably close codeTerminal.app/code to flush any recent changes into the file before making changes, or it may get overwritten from a version codeTerminal.app/code has in memory.  <answer228858> strongFor Mac Terminal user/strong  delete bash commands history with the following command code $ echo '' &gt; ~/.bash_history /code  strongFor Mac zsh user/strong  delete zsh commands history with the following command code $ echo ''&gt; ~/.zsh_hostory /code  <answer280499> In addition to Text Edit, Also, if you are old school, use 'vi' to edit the file and remove the offensive commands. Similar command-line editors are  codeemacs/code em(which shares editing shortcuts with OS X)/em or codenano/code em(which has simplified navigation and visual help on how to save and quit the editor without needing a reference sheet)/em.  <comment39152> Commands are not stored on the fly but only when the shell exits or when prompted to do so (e.g., `history -a` or `history -w`). Usually the last commands are not yet in the file. <comment39159> both answers are correct, i chose the earliest one .. thank you bro .. <comment39165> Whoops, I meant to add you should probably close all instances of terminal.app before editing this file. Fixed. <comment260841> on doing history -c, it says `fc: event not found: -c`. Then I manually opened the file, deleted the contents. `Closed and reopened the terminal` and history does not exist now. <comment352839> That would be covered by "You can open it in TextEdit, *or your editor of choice*", which is in the accepted answer. <comment352840> Note that this will delete the entire history, and not just the last three lines. <comment352843> We prefer answers to stand on their own. Right now it's more a comment than an answer, can you add at least the name of the file to edit?
