Dark stripes in the bottom right corner <body> I have weird dark stripes in the bottom right corner of the screen of my Macbook Pro 15' unibody Mid 2010.  Please see the picture here.  They don't go away, the persist from the time display lights up. I have also tried different instructions on the similar questions I found online (involving Ctrl-Option-Eject) with no positive results.  I'd be grateful for a help in diagnosing the problem and in finding the cheapest way to fix it.  Thanks in advance!  <comment115762> Looks like the LED backlights. <comment115765> Yeah, what he said.  This likely needs a hardware solution; might be best to take it to the apple store or call tech support. <comment115766> Cheaper might be to buy a replacement LCD screen from eBay but its hard to tell without available parts whether problem is in logic board or screen itself. <comment115850> Before spending money, try using external monitor to see if it has the problem. <comment115882> Buscar, thanks for advice. I tried external monitor and it is fine. Does it help to deduce whether the problem is in LCD or in the logic board? <comment115995> If it works in an external monitor, that generally rules out at least the VPU as the source of the issue.  The thing about back-lighting problems is the external monitor provides its own power source for that whereas the built-in is getting powered by the logic board.  But I'm not sure for this particular issue if that would rule it out or not.   I might add that screen failures are **much** more prevalent than logic-board failures.
