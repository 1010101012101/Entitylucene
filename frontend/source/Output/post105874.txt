Disk Utility won't let me partition a disk <body> I'm trying to add a partition to my Macintosh HD using Disk Utility. However, whenever I try to do so, I get "the target disk is too small."  I'm using OS X 10.8.5 on a Retina MBP, and there would be plenty of room (200 GB) left on the disk after the partition.  Why does this error come up?  <comment124472> Which is your Mac model and OS X version?
