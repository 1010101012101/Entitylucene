What is the maximum supported resolution of the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) for an external monitor at 60hz <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013). It has 8GB Ram and Intel Iris 1536 MB .  I want to buy a good external monitor, but I can't find a straight answer as to what this model supports with either Thunderbolt or HDMI.  What is the maximum supported resolution of this model for an external monitor at 60hz ?  (Please note that I don't care about any answers for the 15-inch model or 2015 versions. I only care specifically for the Late 2013 13 inch)  <answer204838> According to Apple's MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) - Technical Specifications...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jKFh8.png" alt="enter image description here"  So it looks like 1080p is the 60Hz limit.  <answer239594> I know I am late to this question, but I own the "MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)" with "Intel Iris 1536 MB". I am currently using the macbook with the "Samsung SMS27A850" according to the system preferences it is currently running at 2560 x 1440 @ 60 Hz using the DisplayPort/Thunderbolt connection (not HDMI).  <comment247444> 1080p would be a resolution of 1920 x 1080, which would match my existing external monitor, so great to know. <comment269385> That last line should add the qualifier "on HDMI". I believe DisplayPort through the Thunderbolt port will give better support for higher-than-HD resolutions. <comment269393> @BasilBourque, Since it's directly under **HDMI video output**, in bold no less, and it is external which it was the OP was asking about, I don't feel it needs additional qualification.
