"mkdir: /Users/me/.bash_sessions: Operation not permitted" <body> When I open Terminal, I get the following error  precodemkdir: /Users/me/.bash_sessions: Operation not permitted /code/pre  Any idea why that may be the case?  Is there a solution?  <answer284734> It's likely that there's something in your profile which is incorrect. Check the contents of your shell's profile, such as ~/.bash_profile. Remove any lines you don't expect or which make reference to mkdir or .bash_sessions.  <answer284738> More than likely the error message is produced by the file- code/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal/code in the last line of this snippet:  precode# Set up the session directory/file. SHELL_SESSION_DIR="$HOME/.bash_sessions" SHELL_SESSION_FILE="$SHELL_SESSION_DIR/$TERM_SESSION_ID.session" mkdir -m 700 -p "$SHELL_SESSION_DIR" /code/pre  codeOperation not permitted/code would suggest some kind of a file lock. Edit your post with the following command and its output:  precode ls -lOed $HOME /code/pre
