Disconnect remote connections before shutdown <body> I'm using pmset to do automatic shutdowns at various times on different days. But, if I have connected remotely at any time since the last startup, when the machines go to shutdown, they either won't start the shutdown process, or they will end up hanging with a black screen with the spinning wheel. I was wondering if there is something I could put in my shutdown script that would sever all connections, or disable all sharing temporarily, and then if I would need to add something to my startup script to enable it again.
