Stuck in a boot loop after failed update to Mavericks, can't reformat HDD <body> I recently tried to upgrade a 2008 Mac Pro from Snow Leopard (10.6.8) to Mavericks (10.9.2) using the free upgrade available in the App Store. The upgrade seemed to go without a hitch until the machine restarted, after which I get the Apple logo with a progress bar---it takes about 20 minutes for the progress bar to advance all the way and then the machine spontaneously powers off. When powered back on the process repeats itself.  So far I have tried:  ol listrongReboot into recovery/strong using kbdcommand/kbd+kbdr/kbd. This works and I'm able to launch the Disk Utility. This shows codeS.M.A.R.T Status : Verified/code. Running codeVerify Disk/code on the HDD (topmost level of the tree) shows no errors. However, running verify on the codeMacintosh HD/code partition emdoes/em show errors and asks me to run codeRepair Disk/code, which tells me I have irreparable errors and suggests that I back up my data and reformat./li listrongReformat./strong Still in recovery mode Disk Utility, I first tried running codeErase/code under the codeErase/code tab on  ol lithe HDD, resulting in: codeDisk Erase failed with the error: Couldn't unmount disk./code (in retrospect this makes sense because initially I was booting to the recovery partition on the same disk)/li lithe Macintosh HD partition, resulting in: codeCouldn't open disk./code/li /ol  Next I tried selecting the HDD and the codePartition/code tab. I attempt to remove the Macintosh HD partition by clicking on the minus, but the system hangs on codePreparing to remove partition/code./li listrongTry USB recovery disk./strong After all of this failed I started to suspect that Disk Utility was refusing to make changes to the HDD since I was booting to the recovery partition on the same disk. I then made a bootable USB recovery disk using the Recovery Disk Assistant and am able to boot to it by holding the kbdoption/kbd key on startup. However I am still unable to erase the disk using the methods above and get the same error messages./li listrongTry to force unmount HDD./strong It appears to me that the system is still mounting the HDD even when booting from the USB recovery, thus preventing reformatting. But attempting to force an unmount fails:  precodediskutil unmountDisk force disk1 /code/pre  results in  precodeForced unmount of disk1 failed: at least one volume could not be unmounted /code/pre/li /ol  I'm at a loss for what to try next. It seems unlikely to me that the disk is failing since the SMART status is OK, but I suppose that is a possibility too.  h3EDIT/h3  Following @chillin's suggestion I tried booting to a Mavericks USB install disk, created following the instructions here. Holding kbdoption/kbd on startup I'm able to select the USB and boot appears normal, but with the same result that I am unable to unmount the internal disk to format, even using codediskutil unmountDisk force disk1/code (I get the same error messages for all methods described above). I do notice that the option to emreinstall/em OS X has been replaced by an option to eminstall/em, so I am confident that I'm actually booting to USB.  h3EDIT 2/h3  Following @Édouard's comment I tried booting in verbose mode using kbdcommand/kbd+kbdv/kbd at startup. It seems that codefsck_hfs/code is caught in a loop "repairing" and rechecking the drive, which it does 3-4 times before the machine gives up and powers down (see picture 1). The line code/dev/rdisk1s2 (NO WRITE)/code catches my attention. Could this be why codefsck/code is unable to make the necessary changes to repair the drive?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RuwFK.jpg" alt="Result of booting in verbose mode"  <answer131193> I’m afraid your hard drive is dying. Updating can be somehow hard drive intensive, so it’s not that surprising that it died during an update. If you have no backup, copy your important data to another hard drive with another computersup1/sup.  You can still try to save it with utilities such as DiskWarrior.  Otherwise, you’ll have to buy a new hard drive and install it in your Mac Pro, then copy your data back to it.  hr  ol liAnd start doing regular back up right now./li /ol  <comment153717> The next step would be to make a backup or two of the failing/failed HD using Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper to an external disk. These two apps can create a bootable disk you can then transfer back to a brand new internal HD of vastly larger size. Don't trust the failing/failed HD. At. All. The least expensive is to get a new USB external drive for the backup, then open the case and swap drives when you're done. Worked for one of my clients. <comment153747> "Disk Erase failed with the error: Couldn't unmount disk." When you can't unmount the volume to erase the drive, it's a sure sign the drive is toast. I know this from personal experience. <comment153748> Yes, it does smell dead disk. You could still try booting in Verbose mode (hold command and V during startup) to show details of where the boot fails, but I’m afraid disk replacement will have to happen. Do you have your data backed up? <comment153846> @Édouard thanks for the suggestion, I tried booting in verbose mode (updated question). <comment153856> keep repeating the fsck till it comes back without errors. Get a six-pack and chips :) it might take a while. <comment154029> @Buscar웃 It’s the same error twice. I’m afraid it would loop. <comment154031> you have 700 directories to fix and 100 files to fix, give it a chance. <comment155238> I ended up doing a fresh install on a new disk. I'm now quite sure you were right about the old disk--I get the same failures when trying to check/repair the old disk from the new installation (on the new disk).
