How do I transfer a large number of photos/videos to my iPhone? <body> Here is the case:  I have iPhone 1. It is my main iPhone. I also have iPhone 2. I use iPhone 2 to take 500 photos and videos. I transfer all the photos and videos from iPhone 2 to my computer, all in their original form with all the EXIF data and such.  Now I want to transfer these 500 photos and videos to iPhone 1. Here are some things I don't want to use:  ul liiTunes – unfortunately iTunes doesn't allow you to easily manage your photos, for example by dragging and dropping them in. You need to sync your photos with your computer. I do not want to get into any complications with iTunes./li liiCloud Photo Library – which this might be a good idea, uploading all these photos and videos would take too much time. I'm looking for a solution that is much faster./li /ul  I want to make sure that all the EXIF data and such from the photos are retained, and that nothing is lost.
