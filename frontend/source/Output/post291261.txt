Outlook 2016 HTML Signature <body> I'm trying to add an HTML E-Mail signature to Outlook 2016 for macOS. The method that got me closest to my goal is documented here:  http://mydesignpad.com/how-to-create-an-attractive-html-email-signature-for-microsoft-outlook-2016-for-mac/  This approach emworks perfect/em when I add the signature in strongOutlook Web Access (owa)/strong. As to say the recipient sees the signature formatted as intended and the strongimage is downloaded from a external server/strong. Also the message shows strongno attachment clip/strong in the inbox of whatever E-Mail client.  But when I add the signature to strongOutlook for Mac (Version 15.36)/strong the embedded image is being downloaded before sending a E-Mail and stronggets included as an attachment/strong. So the message strongdoes show an attachment clip/strong in the inbox of whatever E-Mail client.  Does anybody experience same issues? Has someone found a solution/work around?
