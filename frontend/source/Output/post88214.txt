Music's disappeared <body> Today I turned my computer on and I afterwards opened iTunes. To my surprise, my music disappeared, everything that I had was gone. I have no idea what happened and I have no idea how to put it back the way it was.  I had everything organized, I spent hours on end to put everything together when I switched computers and now everything's gone again. I can't sync my phone anymore as long as this stays like it is.  Has anyone got any idea how I can put it back? Is there a backup I don't know of that I can use? I don't remember doing any backup.  <comment103247> Are you using an external drive for your music? Did it get disconnected? Did you accidentally open a different iTunes library? Is the music still in the folder where you stored it? <comment103248> No, I dind't disconnect anything, not that I know of. The music files are still in the same place, yes. But every single change that I've made in terms of organisation, went way. <comment103249> Who else has access to your account ? <comment103262> Is all the music still in Music - iTunes - iTunes Media - Music? Is there an "iTunes Music Library.xml" in the iTunes folder? Feel free to edit your question with answers to some of these queries.
