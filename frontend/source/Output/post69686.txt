Is there an iOS Camera App that shoots a photo every minute? <body> I would like to have an App that shoots a picture every minute, so I can carry my iPhone in my breast pocket to have a photoblog of my day.  A perfect solution would be if that app could create a video from those photos directly.  <answer69688> Look at stop motion apps, like Stop Motion Recorder, StopAnimator, Frameographer - Stop Motion &amp; Time-Lapse, iMotion HD and so on.  You can get a variety of apps if you search for "stop motion" in the app store.  <comment81019> that was the searchquery i was looking for, thx <comment187727> Why not just take a video?
