How do I get a refund on an iOS app I just bought? <body> I just bought an iPhone app knowing that it may or may not provide the feature which was the entire reason for me buying it.  I figured I could always get a refund if it doesn't do what I want.  It doesn't.  But now I've realized I don't know how to get a refund.  Is it possible?  <answer3544> In iTunes, go to emStore/em -emView My Account/em -emPurchase History/em. Select emReport a Problem/em. Fill out the form explaining what happened, and Apple will get back to you with information about whether your refund has been approved or denied.  <answer108741> I have not had success with "Reporting a problem," because my requests have been ignored in three different cases now.  Here's my workflow that has worked for me each time:  ul liPurchase App/li liFind something wrong with App/li liReport a problem (it will be ignored, but do this just to say you did)/li liContact credit card provider and dispute the charge with your reasons (mine are usually "software did not work at all" or "as promised")/li liWait 3-5 business days/li liCredit card provider resolves dispute, issues refund/li liApple disables AppleID due to "security risk" of account access/li liContact apple support by emailing or asking for a phone call/li liWait 1-2 business days for response/li liKindly explain what happened, they respond by following a walkthrough of re-enabling your account after verifying security questions/li /ul  <comment3305> I did this, but after selecting "Application does not work as expected" and typing in my explanation, including request for refund, I got a message that I need to ask the developer for support and the developer's web page opened in Safari.  I guess I won't be getting a refund. <comment3306> @Daryl Unless the developer deliberately mislead you, it's highly unlikely that you'll get a refund from Apple. Sorry. <comment343738> Apple never responds to these
