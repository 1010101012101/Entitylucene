Can’t reboot into OS X from Boot Camp <body> I made a partition with Boot Camp on my wife's Macbook Pro and installed Windows, however after being installed I can not find the Boot Camp control panel.  I have looked in the control panel and the task bar. The program is simply not there. I can't get the Macbook to run OS X at all at this point, but can verify that the partition is only 40 GB in size. At this point, I don't care if I can get the partition working. I'm more worried about getting the OS X partition back up. I do not have a OS X install disk — the computer didn't come with one.  <answer62372> First you should be able to boot into OS X if you press and hold the kbd&#x2325;/kbd key just after pressing the power button.  For the Bootcamp control panel to appear, you should install the Bootcamp drivers from Apple. Run emBoot Camp Assistant/em to get them or try these tips.
