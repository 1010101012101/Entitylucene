Why is removing hard-linked files so slow in Lion? <body> precode$ ln src/* dir $ rm dir/* /code/pre  If codesrc//code contains a few hundred files, the coderm/code operation takes many minutes. If I open the directory in Finder, I can see the files vanishing one by one. This operation used to be virtually instantaneous in Snow Leopard, but is excruciatingly slow in Lion. If I emcopy/em the files instead of hard-linking them, removing them is still instantaneous.  Can anybody tell me what has changed to warrant this slowness?  <answer21886> I think I figured it out. It seems to be Mobile Time Machine that's causing the slowdown. Apparently it's dutifully taking a backup of the files while they're being deleted. If the files are "original", it can simply emmove/em them to the Time Machine vault, but if they're links it has to emcopy/em them instead, which takes much longer.  <comment24056> I can't reproduce this here. rm takes hardly any time at all. Is another process accessing the drive at the same time?
