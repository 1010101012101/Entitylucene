Fix 'Home' and 'End' keys on non-Cocoa applications <body> Found that it's a common problem that the 'Home' and 'End' keys don't function as-expected on MacOS. Found this fix, posted on LifeHacker:  http://lifehacker.com/225873/mac-switchers-tip--remap-the-home-and-end-keys  The issue is that this fix only works on native/Cocoa apps and doesn't work on many of the other apps like ThunderBird and Eclipse. Will be thankful for any help, regarding this.  PS: I frequently switch between the beginning and end of the line and this has been so annoying lately that I switch to a vim window to edit code and use Eclipse only for debugging it.  <answer143300> You can do this with strongKarabiner/strong's 'Use PC Style Home/End #2'.br This remaps Home and End to ⌘← and ⌘→ respectively.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K06K2.png" width="668"  <answer147460> Found this AddOn, that solves this issue perfectly. It just remaps all key-shortcuts on ThunderBird to work as it works on other systems like Windows and Linux.  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keyfixer/  This is by-far the easiest and most effective method I could find.  <answer181417> I have the wired keyboard for my iMac.  All I have to do is hit the down arrow and it takes me to the end of the line I that my cursor is on.  It works exactly like the "end" key on my old windows computers.  <comment168752> Do the answers in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16135/remap-home-and-end-to-beginning-and-end-of-line?rq=1 help? <comment215770> normally `ctrl-a` and `ctrl-e` switch to the beginning of a line, regardless of the input.
