Cleaning up temp and bash + periodics <body> Every night, I run the following commands in codeTerminal/code before shutting down my Mac, but I wonder if I should just enter them in the same directory that my Terminal appears in (code/Users/myUserName/code) or should I codecd/code to a particular directory?  precoderm -rf ~/.bash_history rm -rf .TemporaryItems rm -rf .Trash sudo periodic daily sudo periodic weekly sudo periodic monthly history -c /code/pre  <answer269955> Ignoring for a moment that the codedaily, weekly, monthly/code jobs are running automatically anyway, you need to make sure that you are either in the correct directory or using absolute paths when running coderm/code:  precoderm -rf /PATH/TO/.TemporaryItems rm -rf ~/.Trash /code/pre  <comment339197> Thanks patrix. I am not trying to remove `temp`s from a specific directory. I thought this command would remove all the `temp`s that have been formed during the session your machine has been working. Is this not the case? <comment339198> Not really. `rm` deletes specific files and folders. Temporary files get removed by the system automatically (after you log out, periodically or after a reboot). <comment339199> Why not set HISTFILESIZE to zero? <comment339204> Good suggestion. Thank you. I just learned about `HISTFILESIZE` now...
