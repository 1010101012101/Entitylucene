How to remove all pictures from the Photos app and put them in a folder? <body> I want to store some pictures that I had in a camera in a folder on my mac, but when I inserted its memory card on the the respective USB port, the app codePhotos/code opened up, and there was the option to import the pictures, which is what I did.   Now, I just would like to retrieve all these pictures and put them in a folder that I want. How can I do it? I don't want this Photos app to keep track of any picture that I imported actually.  <answer232649> By default, imported original photos are located at:     ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/   So putting them into a folder is as simple as copying the 'Masters" folder elsewhere.  Alternatively you can select the photos you wish to retrieve and then go to codeFile &gt; Export &gt; Export Unmodified Original/code.
