Can Safari be configured to not hide the full URL path in the omnibar? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Fading of the URL in Safari 6&#39;s Unified Search and URL Field br   How to fix Safari 6 on Mountain Lion that doesn&#39;t show the full URL in the address bar unless I click it?       The latest Safari version (6.0 (8536.25)) now hides the URL path from the address bar. Instead, it only showing the hostname (e.g. right now I only see "apple.stackexchange.com"). Clicking on the bar to edit will revert it to the full URL (e.g. apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask).  Note that this is different to previous behavior where the URL path was still shown, albeit in a lighter shade of gray. Now it's completely gone, and only clicking will bring it back.  This is very annoying, and downright crippling when developing web applications. Is there a way to disable this behavior? I combed through the preferences dialog but couldn't find anything remotely related.  <comment71792> I very much hope that there might be a hidden preference that could revert this display and possibly the coloring where the text after the host name (starting with the /) is a dimmer grey to let the host have more visual contrast.
