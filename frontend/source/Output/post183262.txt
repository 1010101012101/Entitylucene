How can I share an album publicly (i.e. with non-icloud users) on iCloud <body> Using "Photos" Version 1.0 (209.52.0) that just got "put" on my computer at last update. Here's what my share menu looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B82qQ.png" alt="&quot;Share album&quot; flyout menu with the following fields: Shared Album Name, To, and Comment. Disabled &quot;create&quot; button as well."  Here's the support page where I looked for help.  strongGoal/strong: expose photo album via a URL I can copy/paste to people.  <answer183284> Share it with the person - then once the album is created, in Photos, there will be an icon with a head in a circle. This is the settings pane for the shared photo album.  Full Procedure:  ol liCreate Shared iCloud Album/li liSelect new Shared Album from left side pane in Photos/li liClick head in a circle icon to get an option to turn on the Public Website./li liCheck that box and it gives you the URL./li /ol  Sample:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XbqXd.png" alt="Album Options pane"  Not obvious, but it works.
