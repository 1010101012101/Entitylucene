How to find physical location of an application by name? <body> I can open Terminal and execute codeopen -a "iPhone Simulator"/code and as long as the application is installed, it will launch. Is there a similar command that will return the path to the application instead of launching it?  <answer123079> If you type this:     find /Applications -name "Safari"   you will find the Safari.app for example. I do not have iPhone Simulator, thus I cannot test that one.  If you type      mdfind "Safari"   you will find all records containing Safari (or iPhone Simulator).  strongNote:/strong safari is not the best option to search for as it is a native program  <answer123172> precode$ mdfind 'kMDItemContentType=com.apple.application-bundle&amp;&amp;kMDItemFSName=MacVim.app' /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.4-71/MacVim.app $ osascript -e 'POSIX path of (path to app "MacVim")' /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.4-71/MacVim.app/ $ lsregister -dump|grep '^\tpath: .*/MacVim\.app$'     path:          /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.4-71/MacVim.app /code/pre  Or if the application is running:  precode$ lsappinfo info -app MacVim -only kLSBundlePathKey "LSBundlePath"="/usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.4-71/MacVim.app" /code/pre  <comment143681> `find` isn't going to be very useful since you have to put the path in front of the application so you'd already know what @michael-teper is asking for. <comment143682> He asked for an Application which is installed. Since default location is /Applications, that isn't very weird is it? Besides, if /Applications does not work, you can use / instead. Resulting in some access denied errors and results. <comment143709> Per @Robuust, `find /Applications -name "iPhone Simulator"` does work, thank you!
