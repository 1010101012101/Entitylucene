How can I prevent an application from showing on the Dock? <body> Working with Mac OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks).  I have an application that is launched with my session and displays its menu from the status bar.  Also, I would like to know if there is a way to prevent this application from also showing on the Dock since I have the possibility to access its menu from the status bar.  If I remove the icon from the Dock, then the application quits.  I've been searching on the web for a solution, I found that modifying the strongeminfo.plist/em/strong of the emcontent/em of the app adding :  precode&lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  could solve the issue, but in vain, after that modification, the app keeps "jumping" but doesn't launch. So I recover the code as it was before.  <answer157178> Modifying the codeInfo.plist/code has made sandboxed applications crash on launch since 10.8.  You can for example run  precodelsappinfo setinfo -app TextEdit ApplicationType=UIElement /code/pre  after opening TextEdit to hide TextEdit from the Dock temporarily, but I don't know how to make the change permanent.  <answer163073> Maybe a long shot ...  Is that app one that is shown in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Items  If you check the box there to hide the app, does it still show in the Dock?  <comment184886> I looked for a lasting solution.. Thanks anyway. <comment190836> According to Apple doc: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-108256 this should be a "string" not "boolean". So instead of `true/` try `string1/string`. <comment205578> sorry for long response delay. Unfortunately yes it still shows in the Dock even if it's hidden in System Preferences  Users & Groups  Login Items. <comment205580> @MateuszSzlosek it works fine thanks a lot !
