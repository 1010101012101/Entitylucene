Numbers.app - How do I add a series of columns <body> I have a spreadsheet with about 600 rows and 20 columns.  I want to add a unique identifier to each cell so that I can use the exported CSV output in another app.  So I thought that I could add a column after each existing column, and then use a formula to populate the cells.  So, first, are there better ways to do this? and if not, is there a short cut to adding 20 new columns?
