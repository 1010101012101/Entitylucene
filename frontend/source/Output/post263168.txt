How can I open a port (not application) in the macOS Sierra firewall? <body> I am trying to follow up on this thread and to update it for macOS Sierra (and probably all versions since Yosemite).   In that thread, a way to open a single port in the OS's firewall was suggested:   precodesudo ipfw add 40000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port portnum /code/pre  However, since Yosemite, ipfw was replaced with pf and, unless I am mistaken, pfctl should therefore be used.   What would the above command translate to?  <answer263171> To open a port you would use the following line(s):  precodepass in proto tcp from any to any port 40000 pass in proto tcp from any to any port 80 pass in proto {tcp, udp} from any to any port 53 pass in from any to any port 3601 /code/pre  To quick-start pf and open a port with strongone/strong of the lines above use e.g.:  precodeecho "pass in proto tcp from any to any port 40000" | sudo pfctl -ef - /code/pre  To test the rule(s) use: codesudo pfctl -s rules/code  After a reboot you would have to enter the command again, because pf is not started automatically.  By default the pf.conf file has no emblocking all/em rule. So even after starting pf with codesudo pfctl -e/code nothing is blocked.  If you don't want to dive deeply into pf/pf.conf/pfctl, I recommend to use a pfctl GUI like the free Murus Lite to configure pf.  <comment350570> Mac OS Sierra keeps complaining about pfctl interfering with internal firewall by flushing rules that have been set on startup. What? Are there different firewalls? How come? ... As a conclusion this sounds pretty ridiculous to me as it renders to be unnecessarily painful to do something as simple as open a port for incoming connections, in my case to expose homebrewn dnsmasq to local network under Sierra. (With this "application" not listed as application to be enabled the common way.) <comment350574> @cepharum macOS Sierra provides two different firewalls: pf (no Apple GUI) and the Application Firewall (System Prefs  Security  Firewall). Feel free to ask a separate question covering your problem.
