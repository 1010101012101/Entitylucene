Laptop frozen on Apple logo screen during update to Yosemite <body> I have a MacBook Pro from later 2011 running on the lion operating system. I took all the precautions noted on other websites (repaired disk, deleted large applications). I had enough storage for this program to run. I started the whole process of downloading Yosemite one day and it has been 22 hours of downloading/installing... Currently the screen display is gray with the gray apple logo and underneath it the status bar looks to be about 50% complete. It has been stuck there for the last 10 hours. I have tried the command + L to see the status but it makes the noise that signals that it's an incorrect move.   I called apple support and since my apple coverage is up, they wanted to charge me $30 for something I don't think can be fixed over the phone. HELP! I'm worried I'll screw up my computer if I force a shut down.   <comment228285> Unfortunately, the only option at this point is to force shutdown. If the installer has been stuck that long, something has gone wrong with it. However, a force shutdown does not mean that the installer wouldn't be able to restart from where it was. Try that, and if it fails again, try booting into a recovery drive holding down R (or Option R) on boot. <comment228286> Not clear to me. The download it self should be about 2-3 hours to download the 5.6 Gig file. Did you complete that? Once the download is completed then you start the install. If the download is stuck then you have Internet problems. <comment228327> ALL IS WELL! I did a force shutdown. When I rebooted it, the installation took 2 min and everything seems to be working. Thanks!
