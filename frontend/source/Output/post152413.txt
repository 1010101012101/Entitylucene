Trying to install Homebrew, but I get this "fatal: cannot create directory at 'Library/ENV/pkgconfig/10.10': Permission denied" <body> I am having issues with Brew. It was working fine, but now it's a little wonky.  Tried re-installing, but I get this error:"fatal: cannot create directory at 'Library/ENV/pkgconfig/10.10': Permission denied"  Anyone know how to fix this?  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" -e:70: warning: Insecure world writable dir /usr/local in PATH, mode 040777 ==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/... /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1     Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /Library/Caches/Homebrew Password: ==&gt; Downloading and installing Homebrew... remote: Counting objects: 207213, done.     remote: Compressing objects: 100% (55712/55712), done.     remote: Total 207213 (delta 150324), reused 207201 (delta 150315)     Receiving objects: 100% (207213/207213), 43.70 MiB | 3.08 MiB/s, done.

It happen to me once also but it's coming from sass/grunt. Permission denied just to find out that special file was created by other user (because I copied it from somewhere) and it have overriding problems, thats why it return permission denied.  Well, that's my case, hope this little stuff might help you. Who knows :P  <answer152485> The error appears to be your permissions are too global on code/usr/local/code so it's trying to default to code/usr/local/Library/code  Try changing to code755/code:  precodesudo chmod 755 /usr/local /code/pre  Also the user should be coderoot:admin/code (if not already)  precodesudo chown root:admin /usr/local /code/pre  strongNOTE/strong: not using the -R flag here as most, if not all stuff within /usr/local belongs to current user  <comment179373> Thanks man. No such file exists. I installed Homebrew in a different folder and symlinked it to /usr/local/bin, then I ran Brew doctor. It told me Xcode is not uptodate.  So I updated Xcode, and ran it again. Still doesn't work :( <comment179800> That's weird. Thanks mate. Will give it a go
