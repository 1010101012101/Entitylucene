Can't change Dock size <body> I can't change the Dock's size.

Google it it's not on App Store although it should be it's awesome   <answer197440> After deleting the "/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist" file you will need to reset the Dock for it to take effect. You can do this simply in a Terminal window with codekillall Dock/code.  You could also just try editing the plist file in a text editor. The codetilesize/code parameter is the one that determines the dock size. It should look something like the following.  precode&lt;key&gt;tilesize&lt;/key&gt; &lt;real&gt;50&lt;/real&gt; /code/pre  You should also be able to resize the Dock by clicking on the dividing line between the application tiles and the file/folder tiles.  If resizing just doesn't work at all, there is a way to prevent changes to the Dock by making the size "immutable". If that has happened you can re-enable changes by entering the following commands in a Terminal window.  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock size-immutable -bool false killall Dock /code/pre  <answer197455> after deleting the plist mentioned above, hold the CTL+Alt(option) key and click Finder in the Dock, and choose "relaunch". That's all.
