How to make the iMac go to sleep after certain amount of time? <body> My MacBook Pro has settings for putting the Mac to sleep after a certain amount of idle time. My iMac does not have that setting. See the screenshot (sorry, it's in German).   I want to make sure that the iMac uses the least amount of energy when not used.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xD8eI.png" alt="Energy settings for an iMac"  <answer138561> Did you try unticking "Automatisches Aktivieren des Computerruhezustandes bei ausgeschaltetem Display au√üer Kraft setzen"?  Then there should be another Slider which allows you to set the automatic Sleep.  <answer138562> The sleep settings have changed due to the new Haswell chips. Because wake-up from sleep is so quick now, and because of the new automatic sleep modes in the CPU, the only thing drawing significant power is the display. Therefore, Apple deemed a sleep setting was only necessary for the display.  Click that last Power Nap checkbox if you want the computer to periodically wake up to do updates and check for mail, etc.  <comment163590> Nope, that slider does not appear. I deactivated this setting, because I need to run some non PowerNap apps. But I would also like to still have the Mac sleep after some hours of idling.
