Upgrade to Mavericks wipes out Python site-packages directory? <body> As the subject suggests, I recently upgraded to OSX Mavericks, and...  precode$ ls /Library/Python/*/site-packages/ /Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/: Extras.pth README  /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/: README  /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/: README  /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/: README  /code/pre  I had a bunch of modules installed there, mostly Django stuff and dependencies thereof under 2.7, and now it seems to all be... just gone. And no, the READMEs don't say anything helpful.  So, questions:  ol liHas anyone else seen this? I can't find any other mentions of it online, so... maybe there's something else going on?/li liAny suggestions for things I should do or investigate before I just start re-installing it all while cursing quietly to myself?/li /ol  <answer120123> Apple tends to wipe out supporting files for scripting languages such as codepython/code, codeperl/code, and coderuby/code with each major upgrade.  To avoid this in the future, look for package manager that maintains and works with a local copy of python outside of the Apple managed folders of code/Library/code and code/System/code. A good starting point is homebrew:  Install codehomebrew/code with:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)" /code/pre  Then install a local copy of python with:  precodebrew install python /code/pre  For perl, the perlbrew project is ideal and explicitly calls out Apple for his behaviour.  <comment140129> Seems to be almost a duplicate of this question...  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106887/ipython-python-broken-after-upgrading-to-os-x-mavericks/107065#107065
