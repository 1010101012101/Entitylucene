iPhone voicemail notice outside cellular service, but no msg when in service area? <body> I am often in remote areas without cellular service. I do get wireless connection, and every so often my iPhone4S (iOS9.3.5) displays a notification on my phone service (the red dot without a number):    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIqXA.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0qHW.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I get to a cell service area, however, there is no message.    Is this red dot indicating a voice message has arrived?  Is the notice a mistake?    Has an actual voice message been deleted?    <answer275422> I always thought the red dot without a number means your Voicemail service is unavailable, not that you have Voicemail waiting.  I spend a lot of my time outside reception areas, or abroad with no roaming, &amp; I have that icon the entire time I'm away; whether or not I have voicemail waiting for me when I get back [usually I don't].  <comment346478> Ah - that certainly would explain it! <comment346479> I have no concrete evidence, only my own anecdotal - but that certainly does seem to have been the case. <comment346481> I'm googling for confirmation... found this which seems promising (I did recently switch SIMs...?) http://osxdaily.com/2014/08/23/blank-red-dot-phone-icon-iphone/ <comment346483> Yeah, I've seen many similar articles - though none that can simply repro what I see when I'm completely 'out of range' <comment346484> Will be in cel range later today and check then. Thanks! <comment346485> Wish you luck :) <comment346501> Well... Backin cel range... No red dot. I looked in the ios9 and my 4s manuals but no mention of this "feature" and i cant find anything from apple about it.
