iOS binaries not working (dyld: could not load inserted library) <body> I am using a jailbroken iPhone 6 on iOS 9.2.  I have installed proxychains from here via Cydia and created a simple proxychains.conf file (containing codehttp  10.0.0.5 8080/code) in the current folder.  I then try and run a command such as: codeproxychains4 -f proxychains.conf openssl s_client -showcerts -connect google.com:443/code  I get the following error:  precode[proxychains] config file found: proxychains.conf [proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/libproxychains4.dylib dyld: could not load inserted library '/usr/lib/libproxychains4.dylib' because no suitable image found.  Did find:         /usr/lib/libproxychains4.dylib: mmap() error 22 at address=0x0017D000, size=0x00001000 segment=__DATA in Segment::map() mapping /usr/lib/libproxychains4.dylib  Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  I get the same error trying to run anything from proxychains, e.g. codeproxychains4 -f proxychains.conf ping 8.8.8.8/code  I then tried installing the version of proxychains from here (http:// cydia.radare.org/debs/) via Cydia and basically the same thing hapens  I separately installed GnuTLS from here (http:// apt.saurik.com/dists/tangelo/main/binary-iphoneos-arm/Packages) also via Cydia and when I try and run it codegnutls-cli/code, I get a very similar error:  precodedyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libgnutls.26.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/bin/gnutls-cli   Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:         /usr/lib/libgnutls.26.dylib: mmap() error 22 at address=0x001B1000, size=0x00005000 segment=__DATA in Segment::map() mapping /usr/lib/libgnutls.26.dylib         /usr/lib/libgnutls.26.dylib: mmap() error 22 at address=0x00269000, size=0x00005000 segment=__DATA in Segment::map() mapping /usr/lib/libgnutls.26.dylib Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  Can anyone shed any light on this?  <comment326390> It hasn't been updated since 2015, so it's likely just not supported on iOS 9. <comment327711> @AndrewLarsson , Are you refering to both proxychains and GnuTLS? They both seem to have a similar issue in two different applications, <comment327950> Yes, they're both old. There have been a lot of things that changed, so it's normal for these things to stop working. This same error occurs for other things that don't work on iOS 9. <comment328125> @AndrewLarsson doh, ok thanks for your help
