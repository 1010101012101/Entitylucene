Multiple instances of the Mumble client <body> I have tried command that I found and it works for second and after that second client closes.  precodeopen -na /Applications/Mumble.app /code/pre  Other command that I tryied with the same resul.  precode/Applications/Mumble.app/Contents/MacOS/Mumble &amp; [2] 27307 [1]   Exit 126                /Applications/Mumble.app /code/pre  What command I must use to have multiple Mumble instances open?  <answer154755> What you and future searchers are looking for is this:  precodeopen -n /Applications/Mumble.app --args -m /code/pre  This is valid as of 11/04/14 on OS X 10.10/Darwin 14.0.0 (Yosemite)  <comment81909> Are you sure that Mumble even supports running with several instances at once? <comment81949> On Windows - I'm sure that it is possible. http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Tips_Tricks#Run_Multiple_instances_of_the_Mumble_Client <comment81953> There it also says you need to specify `-m` when starting the first client, did you try that (`/Applications/Mumble.app/Contents/MacOS/Mumble -m`) <comment82020> It worked but is not possible to connect as a two diffrent users. <comment82023> Then you are probably better off asking at mumble.sourceforge.net directly
