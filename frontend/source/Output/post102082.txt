Apple ID for I4 phone <body> I took over my husbands I4 phone after he passed away. I do not know his Apple ID or password. How can I set this up for myself now?  <answer102085> You could connect it to iTunes on the computer and reset it to a new password. But if you want to keep the password and not go online, you can call an apple specialist or someone that can help you further more. I am not an apple buff, but I am a technology geek, so I can help you with this a little. So here are my tips on this and I hope it works. So sync with iTunes or go to a specialist.  <comment120245> Have you tried restoring the iPhone through iTunes? (Plug in iPhone to computer and hit `Restore` when it pops up in iTunes)
