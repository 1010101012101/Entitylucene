How much faster is the new MacBook Air than the old model? <body> Are there benchmarks about the new cpu?  <answer18771> Looking at the Engadget review, Thisismynext review and Apple's official claims, I'd say it's about 2x faster.  The CPU options are:  ul lii5-2467M (11")/li lii5-2557M (13")/li lii7-2677M/li /ul  To bad the CPU chart sites haven't tested them.  <comment19467> They aren't here yet. They probably will be, though, in the next few days. <comment31235> Faster at what? Draining the battery while running CPU bound benchmarks, browsing the web, booting. The old mac and the new mac sit there doing nothing until you make them preform a specific task.
