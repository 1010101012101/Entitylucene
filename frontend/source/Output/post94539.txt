How do I convert a 24-bit/96 kHz FLAC to anything else? <body> I have some FLAC files I want to convert to AAC, but I can't because my go-to program, Max, throws an exception (codeThe call to ExtAudioFileSetProperty failed./code) when it tries to convert 24-bit/96 kHz FLAC (16-bit is no problem) to any other format.  So is there another good program for converting from FLAC?  <answer94543> Personally I use a tool called strongX Lossless Decoder/strong, or strongXLD/strong for short. I use it for converting FLAC to Apple Lossless regularly, and it’s never hiccupped.  From the project’s page:     XLD can decode following formats:      ul   li(Ogg) FLAC (.flac/.oga)  /li   li[…]/li   /ul   and:     XLD supports various output formats. It can convert audio files into […] MPEG-4 AAC (QuickTime/CoreAudio), MP3 (LAME), Apple Lossless, FLAC […].   XLD is free, and is still being actively maintained. Highly recommended.  <comment154719> Just want to confirm that XLD can convert 24-bit/96 kHz FLAC without a hitch.
