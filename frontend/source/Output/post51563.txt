Default Processes? <body> What are the default processes that would run in a freshly installed copy of Lion? I want to know which ones that I have are third-party processes so I can remove them.  <answer52202> Thre are many and it depends what you are running and I suspect changes from minor version to another so there is no definitive list.  In a terminal type codeps auxwwww/code to list all the processes.  This command includes the full path - from this you can see which are Apple ones in/System /usr/bin, /bin , Then look at each one running from /Applications
