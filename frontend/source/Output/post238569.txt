Mac turns off randomly and has lines on screen <body> For some reason my iMac keeps turning off around 5 to 10 minutes into boot.  Also just recently it turns on but has shaded lines going down the screen. I have not installed any weird programs and i have not used it in around 3 months.   Any ideas on what the issue is, i don't have any other information about the issue besides whats happening when i use it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8vaEd.jpg" alt="heres a picture of my screen" The image i'm showing you was found on google but this looks exactly like mine does.  The model of my imac is the late 2011 model.  <answer238570> On first guess, based on the description of the symptoms, I would say that you are having an issue with your graphics card.  The best way is to run Apple Diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test. Hold kbdD/kbd while booting from a powered off state.  Run the diagnostics and post your results and I will update my answer.  First update based on the comments:  I found this video on YouTube that details this exact problem and it's related to the graphics card.  Now, one word of advice: strongdon't do the fix shown in the video./strong    While the diagnosis is correct, that fix is pure nonsense.  I have had much better results getting the board repaired by a shop that specializes in that type of fix (from eBay - I have used the one in Dana Point, CA with great results and for the record, I am strongnot/strong affiliated with them).    Normally I would say to replace it, but the prices are ridiculous - sometime over $700 for the graphics card.   <comment292621> Welcome to Ask Different.  To be helpful, you should include your *specific* model, operating system, etc.  Also, you should try to include a screen shot or a photo of what you are experiencing; remember, we aren't there to look over your shoulder. <comment292629> Hi sorry about that allan ill do that now <comment292631> Hi Allan, I will do that, i will be home in a few days will do so then <comment292635> I am more inclined to think it's hardware since it's happening *before* the OS gets loaded - meaning doing a reinstall/upgrade will not solve the issue <comment292636> Yes i thought at much but before the lines emerged it would just restart every 5 to 10 minutes could that be a hardware issue? <comment292638> Ok i will most likely do that on the weekend and post the results then, thank you for the help <comment294784> Seems like the diagnostics are not running either the computer keeps restarting instead. <comment297881> when i hold D on the keyboard nothing happens just keeps restarting, i cant even get to the desktop <comment297888> Your Mac came with Snow Leopard (10.6).  If you have the original disks, it will be on Disk 2.  Try booting from that. <comment354528> "don't do the fix shown in the video" - well, I fixed 4 video cards that way. It worked for all four of them - so calling it nonsense is nonsense. <comment354555> There's a reason you don't heat the whole PCB, thus the specialized equipment to re-flow solder of malfunctioning components  Putting a PCB in an oven to re-flow something not only doesn't fix the underlying issue it damages all the other components.  It's a nonsense fix plain and simple. <comment354593> I have fixed for in total 7 '09 - '11 27'' iMacs; 4 of them in the oven, 1 reballed, 2 reflowed. All of them are working fine for more than a year now, not a single one had any problems again so far. Proper reballing is better, no question. But calling a method that works nonsens is nonsens. And baking is a lot better than using a heatgun or anything else you can do at home. It almost always works and lasts for years, by when you will most probably buy a new iMac anyway. Did you actually do it or do you just think it can't work? <comment354596> @user2707001 - I worked for a manufacturer and spent time on the manufacturing line and in the rework department.  I was trained by engineers who do this for a living that putting PCBs in an oven is about the worst thing you can do.  This is the mechanical equivalent of using JB-Weld on joint rather than a proper weld and jumping up for joy that "it held."  Good luck with it. <comment354633> @Allan Agreed, good comparison. It's like using JB-Weld on a joint rather than a proper weld when you know that the mechanical stress on the joint in this specific device is so low that most probably the JB-Weld will hold it together until you throw it away and you know that a proper fix would be half as expensive as the value of the whole device. You can call it improper, but it is not nonsense.  I don't like it either. But specifically these PCB boards take it really well. I wouldn't recommend doing that generally either. But for this specifically this manufacturing fault it's a working fix.
