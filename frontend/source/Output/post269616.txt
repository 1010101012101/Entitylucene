If it's being forced into any other refresh rate (like 30Hz), that could be the problem.  <answer293556> After testing in three different monitors and a couple more cables got it working upgrading my miniDP-DP cable to a HBR2 ("High Bit Rate 2") compatible cable. StarTech.com MDP2DPMM1M  <comment338703> Thanks for your shiny response! :)  Ok, so let's answer these:  - Firmware for expensive dongle is up to date  - I have done a PRAM and SMC reset to no avail  - I've enabled and disabled safe mode, I think, are you referring to SIP mode?  - Currently unsure on the dongle's reliability    - I have another MBP 13" 2015 that I was using that did not have a flicker problem  - I will test on another TV to see what happens  - Firmware drivers for the Samsung screen are Windows only -_-  - Flickering happens randomly at any point, not dependant on intensive graphics usage <comment338704> Sorry for the formatting. The external monitor is being output at 30hz, which sucks and i've tried a whole bunch of things to get it to 60hz with no joy! <comment338706> I will get in contact with Apple and get one of their guys on the case as it says that 60hz is supported. And should work smoothly. I'll post any updates @NYKg <comment338741> Unfortunately in Sierra the option to change the refresh rate on a per-display basis is no longer an existing feature. In previous OS X versions when you connected a display and went to 'System Preferences  Displays  Display' selecting certain resolutions would allow you two toggle the refresh rate between 30hz and 60hz, but this is no longer the case. I'm not sure Apple will be of much help as this isn't a bug, but a removed feature. I believe the thought process behind removing it was that the OS was supposed to be smart enough to automagically choose the correct refresh rate on its own. <comment338744> ...But clearly it doesn't always get it right! From my research online I see that some people have found a couple of 3rd party solutions such as something called cscreen (a Terminal app - http://www.pyehouse.com/cscreen/) or Switchresx (seems a little more user friendly/easier to use - http://www.madrau.com/); both of which require you to install something called 'Mac Pixel Clock Patcher' first (details founds in this answer to another question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/232872/220050) <comment338745> One final comment - Safe Mode is actually something different than SIP mode. Apple quote: "Safe mode is a way to start up your Mac so that it performs certain checks and prevents some software from automatically loading or opening." (including non-required kernal extensions) To boot into Safe Mode simply: Start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The white Apple logo appears on your display. Release the shift key when you see the login window. To get out of Safe Mode, just restart the Mac without holding any keys down. <comment338983> Thanks for your answers. Very informative! I'll try the third party apps and see if that gets it working.. silly Apple trying to be too clever. I'll also give the safe mode a go and see if did the trick. Peace. <comment339408> Booting into Safe mode worked temporarily to get the display to 60Khz, and it indeed got rid of the flicker, but when I rebooted into standard all that loveliness was lost :(. I have also tried the product on madrau.com but that failed to output correctly. It turns out all along.. that I needed a DP cable direct into the screen to get it to work, no hacks, no CSscreen, no terminal or SIP mode. God damn that took a long time! <comment339409> **Solution:** Using a DP cable + Mini DP to USB-C dongle <comment339542> It seems strange and illogical to me that an HDMI-capable display paired with a computer that is clearly capable of outputting a signal that can be carried by an HDMI cable don't play nicely together. That fact that it worked in Safe Mode makes it even more strange (and tells me that it isn't a hardware compatibility issue but either software or driver-related maybe), but I'm glad you were able to figure it out in the end! Congrats! <comment339845> I'm thinking it may be in part a hardware compatibility issue on the monitor's side of things. when I can i'll test my machine on other 4K screens and see what happens there. Thanks for your help! <comment370849> Are you aware of any incompatibility between Samsung screens and Macbooks? My Screen has completely stopped working since a recent MACOS update..  The Macbook detects the screen, and resizes its screen based on the mirroring preset I had set up previously. But the screen just wont display anything and cycles through the channels.. <comment372988> Ugh. Apple support for external monitors is so terrible. How can the solution be: just buy another dongle. To Apple: if it doesn't work using HDMI, please just say it doesn't work, that way people won't spend 200$ buying the wrong cables/dongles. <comment373671> I know, terrible. Now the screen has stopped working completely after an OSX update! It turns out Samsung screens don't play nicely with MBPs
