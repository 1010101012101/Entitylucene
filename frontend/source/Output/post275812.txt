Remap CapsLock to Delete on Sierra <body> Hi I've just got my strongMacBook Pro 2016/strong running 10.12.3 and I'm in a bit of a pickle...  I can't seem to find a way to remap my CapsLock to Delete.  I've tried using strongSeil/strong, strongUkelele/strong and some other software, but non seem to do the job. Seil did't do anything after I've tried using it, and strongUkelele/strong seems a bit confusing, I just want to remap a single key, not the whole keyboard.  Could anybody recommend a software or method i could do this.br Thank you for your time :)  <answer275814> Ah found the solution. Currently the best option, by strongFAR/strong is:br  h1Karabiner-Elements/h1  Hope somebody else finds this useful as well.
