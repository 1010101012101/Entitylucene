Unable to delete partition on El Capitan <body> I have erased the partition with "OS X extended (Journaled)" in disk utility and tried to delete the partition, both normally and in recovery.   Whenever I try to '-' the partition it is greyed out, and it tells me I need to 'enable journaling' through 'file'. When I click 'enable journaling' it does nothing. A friend of mine had the laptop set up with an even split partition both 250gb each. Not sure if he did anything special when partitioning the hard drive, but normal methods have failed to fix the issue.
