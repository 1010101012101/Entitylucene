How can I switch Dock configurations when an external display is connected? <body> I have a MacBook Pro that I use in two different 'modes', emmobile/em and emdesktop/em.  Mobile is for when I'm using just the MBP with the integrated trackpad, keyboard, and display.br Desktop is for when I'm using it with external displays and an external keyboard and mouse, usually in clamshell mode.  A couple of facts have led me to look for a way to configure a different Dock to appear in each mode:  ol liThe resolution of the external displays is higher than that of the internal display, so I have more room for extra apps/folders/spacers in the Dock./li liI generally use a different set of main apps in each mode./li /ol  strongSo, is there a way to configure two different Docks in OS X and switch between them either automatically based on the presence of an external display or manually?/strong  <answer56996> I found a manual solution, Dock Spaces.  It will cost you a little bit under $8, though.  Hopefully that's not an issue.  As for automating it, I'm not sure if it is scriptable or not, but it does not have automation like this built-in.  <answer57028> DockSpaces is the answer to your question. DockSpaces allows you to create docks with  different applications in each dock. It does not have the automation built in, so I would recommend to you an application that you recommended to me, ControlPlane. You should be able to change docks based on the presence of an external display.  <answer57035> DockSpaces is nice and convenient, but annoyingly unscriptable. So, I wrote two little shell scripts, one to change to my desktop Dock and one to change to my mobile Dock.  The desktop script is triggered on arrival in my Home context in ControlPlane, and the mobile script is triggered by departure from it.br The desktop context is defined based on the presence of my external displays: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x0wsc.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHere's how the scripts work:/strong  I save a copy of both Docks in my Documents folder (the Dock configuration is stored in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist/code).  When I switch from one to the other, I replace the appropriate file in my Documents folder with the current file in my Preferences so that changes I've made to the Dock are saved. Then I copy the alternate Dock from my Documents to my Preferences. Finally, the Dock process is restarted so that the changes take effect.  strongThe Scripts:/strong  To Desktop:  precode#!/bin/bash  cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist ~/Documents/Docks/mobile.plist cp ~/Documents/Docks/desktop.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist killall Dock /code/pre  To Mobile:  precode#!/bin/bash  cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist ~/Documents/Docks/desktop.plist cp ~/Documents/Docks/mobile.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist killall Dock /code/pre  <comment93593> Was stuck with Sidekick until today. I'll never look back. <comment103151> New open source script: http://andrebaumeier.github.io/osx-dock-location/ reacts on desktop width changes and asks for the new position of your dock. Feel free to for and add your logic.
