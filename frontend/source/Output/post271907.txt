Reindex iMac Mail <body> My iMac (21.5 inch 2011) started slowing down early in January not long after I upgraded to the then latest version 10.12.2 .   It would take forever to start then Safari kept crashing as soon as I entered a URL or web address. Mail took forever to load and although the download speed from the Ethernet point was 15 gbps when I attached a PC for my Mac it was showing 0.12 gbps.  This went on for a couple of weeks. I noticed there was a later operating system version 10.12.3 so I did a safe start and managed to load it.  There was no improvement.  A couple of days ago on trying to start Mail and giving up waiting for a response I noticed when I came back to the MAC there was a window telling me to quit mail and reindex.  I've tried a couple of times but have no idea if the reindex started, failed or whatever.  Today I started in safe mode, got the same reindex message so hit the quit and reindex tab. That was 13 hours ago.  Activity Monitor is showing the Mail icon as greyed out and .there are only a few processes running with any significant activity.  These are emlaunched/em, emkernel_task/em, emaccounted/em, emcfprefsd/em, emphoto analysis/em and emsoftwareupdated/em.  For the last 6 or so hours there only seems to be Writes out activity.  emlaunched/em has written 3.33 GB and emkernel_task/em 957 MB.  My question - is anything going on? And if it is the reindex - how long does it take?  Should I kill the session?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GHax.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment341756> You forgot to mention what iMac model (we need to know how old it is) how much memory, etc.  Also, try running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.

No issues. But if I try and start Mail it just gets the spinning beachball and i tried to force quit it as it is in a non responsive state. I tried starting Excel before starting Mail and that worked fine. The force quit action is also unresponsive so I've had to hold the start button to shut the IMac down. This all started after I upgraded to 10.12.2
