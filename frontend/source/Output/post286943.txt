How do I write a script that opens an iTerm2 window and runs a command? <body> h2What I'm doing/h2  I'm using iTerm2 Build 3.0.15 and writing a script that opens a new window and prints "hello world" to the screen. Really, I'm interested in being to run any command but using codeecho "hello world"/code as a starting point.  h2What I've tried/h2  I read up on the iTerm2 documentation for scripting. I wanted to learn more so I dragged the codeiTerm2/code icon on the codeScript Editor/code icon to view the dictionary available to me and found the following command:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VqRK6.png" alt="enter image description here"  From reading the dictionary and documentation I wrote the following script:  precodetell application "iTerm"   create window with default profile command "echo hello world" end tell /code/pre  When I run my script from the terminal a new window opened and "hello world" was on the screen; however, I got the following broken pipe error: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Y7Li.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I select codeOk/code the window closed and I'm left with the following message:  precode$ osascript iterm.applescript window id 6415 /code/pre  h2The Questions/h2  ul liWhat do these broken pipe and window id 6415 errors mean?/li liHow do I write a script that opens an iTerm2 window and runs a command?/li /ul  <answer286960> Replace codecommand "echo hello world"/code with  precodecommand "bash -c \"echo hello world &amp;&amp; read\"" /code/pre  The use of coderead/code makes bash wait for the user to end the line (i.e. by pressing enter) before exiting. Pressing enter within 3 seconds will still yield the warning, as this is an iTerm feature which you can disable by checking the box on the alert, and control more precisely in Preferences → Advanced → Warn about short-lived sessions.  <comment362206> @user Sure, edited <comment362208> Is it possible to not have the terminal close? The goal is to be able to say "Open iTerm run this command and don't quit"
