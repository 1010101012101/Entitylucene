Trying to backup MacOS on a USB key get error 254? <body> I'm trying to backup my MacOS computer onto an USB key, and when I run the restore command from the Disk Utility app, I get an error 254 :  precodeValidating target... Validating source... Source volumt format on device "/dev/disk0" is not valid for restoring Could not validate source - error 254 The operation failed /code/pre  For information, the title is really odd since it shows strongRestoring to "My Usb Key" from "(null)"/strong (sorry the text is approximative (it's originally in French), but the main point here is the "from null")  What is wrong with my usb key? (it's a 8Gb, Apple asked for a "more than 1gb").  Thank you for your help.  <answer261165> Make sure you've selected the volume, not the disk, in the list on the left. I saw the same error when I tried using the disk selected.  Also note, making a copy of a booted system may not produce the best results...  <comment327164> I tried with various item (volumes, disk, etc) with different results, but never successful. I finally followed a documentation from Apple https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 and this worked successfully well :)
