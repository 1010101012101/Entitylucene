Automator - Conversion from image files to Files/Folders failed <body> I am trying to do a simple task of just taking a screenshot with automator and importing that screenshot into iPhoto.  The screenshot takes fine and saves it to the correct location.  It does save as a .png file but then I get an error when it goes to the next step of getting the specified finder items.  It fails and states codeConversion from Image files to Files/Folders failed/code and codeunrecognized selector sent to instance/code.  See screenshot below.    My ultimate goal is to do a time lapse setup with automator.  Any thoughts on what may be causing this error?  I am running OSX 10.8.3  Thanks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nadxI.png" alt="Error Image"  <answer88030> Try to ignore input for codeGet Specified Finder Items/code action.  To do so, select codeOptions/code, and check codeIgnore this action's input/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dNSiB.png" alt="enter image description here"
