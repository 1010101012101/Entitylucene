Four-finger swipe gesture also triggers three-finger swipe gesture <body> I have set emApp Expose/em to open with a three-finger swipe down, and I used BetterTouchTool to set up a four-finger swipe down as a custom gesture to close tabs in Chrome. However, whenever I four-finger swipe down, I get both gestures at once (the tab closes and emApp Expose/em comes up).  However, this does emnot/em happen the other way round: if I set four fingers to open emApp Expose/em and three fingers to close tabs, everything works as it should.  I found an old question asking about the same thing but it has no answers.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be causing this?
