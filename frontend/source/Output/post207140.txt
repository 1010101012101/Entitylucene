Use Siri to play all songs (shuffled) in iOS 9 <body> In iOS 8.4 and below, I could tell Siri, "play all songs, shuffled" or "shuffle all songs" no matter where in the OS I was. But now when I try that, Siri tells me that I must be in the Music app, playing a song for that command to work. And even when I am in the Music app, it only shuffles the songs in the current album or playlist.  Does anyone know how to tell Siri to "play all songs (shuffled)" in iOS 9?  <answer219781> "Siri, shuffle all my music" - that worked for me!
