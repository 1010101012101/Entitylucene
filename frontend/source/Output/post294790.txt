Group opened programs in osx dock <body> I have OSX 10.12.6. My dock is placed on the left of the screen and I have quite a few programs open, about 20 at the moment. This barely fits on my screen and I'm wondering if I can group those programs in the dock. I know it's possible when they are not opened like this: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201955  But this is only when the program is not openend. I'd like to group the opened programs as well.
