Use pc mic for iPhone <body> How can I use my pc microphone for iPhone? I want to input the sound from computer to iPhone. Does anyone know anyway that can be possible? Something more efficient than just putting the phone near the pic speaker.  <comment278418> For what purpose? Phone call audio or something else? <comment278421> Yes during the live phone call <comment278423> Best bet is probably Bluetooth, but you need to find the correct [bluetooth profile](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204387) for the PC end.  I think phone call audio might be part of A2DP, but this is only half the problem, because you need the pc to act as a client (headset) rather than a source.
