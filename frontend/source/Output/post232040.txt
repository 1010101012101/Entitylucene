What iPhone model is shown in Apple's Recycling video? <body> In Apple's most recent event, they highlighted their environmentally-friendly products. One of their videos sported a robot named Liam, who would disassemble iPhones once they were in need of recycling.  However, in the video I couldn't place the iPhone shown on the disassembly line. I've included an image below. Can somebody identify it? Or is it not an iPhone in the current lineup, something different or...dare I say...new?  Looks like it has a flush camera lens, which is something the newer models don't have. That's what's confusing me.  Link to the video is right here, at the bottom of the page.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cPDFK.jpg" alt="iPhone on disassembly line"  <answer232067> Judging by the guts of it, the size, and the finish, I am going to say that this is an  h1iPhone 6/h1  It's too big and rounded to be a 5/5S series or earlier.  Assuming that it's not the iPhone 7 (which hasn't even hit the prototype phase), we can narrow it down to a iPhone 6 or 6S.  There is one slight difference between the two:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nkaAG.jpg" alt="iPhone 6/6S difference"  In our little video we see that it has only the iPhone name on it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUj48.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 with non-S identification"  So, that's why I say it's an  h1iPhone 6/h1  <comment283461> Could you please add the link to the video. <comment283462> Of course. One moment... <comment283463> There we go. Video's at the bottom of the page. <comment283464> This video is amazing. Anyway, I think the iPhone is an iPhone 6 or just a fake one. For sure the video is enormously edited and this I guess is the explanation at the thing that confused you. <comment283536> Apple is secretly telling all of us to recycle our Sixes and get the S model. <comment283576> Either that, or the video was made before the iPhone 6S was released, so they didn't want to give away its presence.
