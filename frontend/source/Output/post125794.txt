IOS 7, enable to setup personal hot spot <body> After Updating latest version of iOS 7. strongI am not able to setup personal hot spot in my iPhone 4/strong.  I use strongBSNL (India) carrier/strong. I was told by the carrier that the problem is an issue with the iPhone update.  I use BSNL for 7 years with a 3G data plan. Until now, I have not had any hot spot related issues but after updating to the latest version of iOS 7 this problem began.  How can I solve this problem? Any hints or suggestions are most welcome.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wq0Tz.png" alt="Cellular waring - Set Up Personal Hotspot"  <answer128534> ol lisetting- cellular- cellular data network./li liCellular data apn: test username: test password: 12345678/li liPersonal hotspot apn: test username: test password: 123456789/li /ol  have good day  <comment147226> Welcome to Ask Different!
