brew path didn't cover sbin <body> I have problem when I used brew to install aircrack-ng. I found out that it cover path  precode/usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/bin /code/pre  but it couldn't find commands after I tried tab-completion in path  precode/usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/sbin /code/pre  What should I do? Do I need to add another path?  <answer62572> By convention, .../bin directories are for all users, .../sbin directories are for usage by root only. I don't know the setup if homebrew, but maybe /usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/sbin is on the path if you are root?  <answer89782> The codesbin/code directory, which some admin tools like dsniff and aircrack install to, is not on the path by default, and it's not in Homebrew's initial setup instructions, which tell you to get code/usr/local/bin/code on your path. This is because, traditionally, codesbin//code is for administrative tools that only root would expect to run.  Tab completion is picking up the files in code/usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/bin/code because they are symlinked in to code/usr/local/bin/code, which is on your PATH. It does not find the files in code/usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/sbin/code, because they are symlinked in to code/usr/local/sbin/code, which is not on your PATH. Your current working directory does not matter for tab-completion, because code./code (the current directory) is not on the PATH.  If you want to see those other programs on your path, where tab-completion can pick them up, add code/usr/local/sbin/code to your PATH in the same place you added code/usr/local/bin/code - probably your ~/.bashrc file.  In general, if you want to use tab-completion on programs in the current directory, you need to call them with a code.//code prefix. For example, codecd /usr/local/sbin/code and then type code./air/code and hit tab, and you'll get some choices.  <comment72148> Have you tried `brew doctor` already? Does it say something about your PATH?
