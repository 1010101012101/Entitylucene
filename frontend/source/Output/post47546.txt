How to Remote-Sync IPad Calendar with Outlook <body> Without installing ITunes, and without attaching my IPad3 to my PC, I want to synchronize my IPad calendar with my Outlook calendar.    I thought I could make this work by creating the following Outlook rule:  code"Send an alert to my mobile device when I get messages from someone"/code  With the option:  code"Which is a meeting invitation or update"/code  I then specifiy that I want the invite forwarded to my gmail account, which my IPad is linked to.  I don't know if this would have worked, because this Outlook rule doesn't seem to execute when a meeting invite arrives.  However, when I attempt to manually forward a meeting invite I've received, I notice that an ical attachment is present.  I can then manually add it to my calendar.  Not so bad!  However, it would be even cooler if the IPad "auto-added" the ical notice to my calendar as the emails (with icals attached) arrive.  Is there a way to configure an auto-accept (particularly an auto-accept from a specific e-mail address)?  p.s. And while we're discussing this, does anyone know why Outlook would fail to execute the rule I defined?  <answer47717> You can configure Exchange on your iPad by:  ol liOpen strongSettings/strong/li liGo to strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong/li liTap on strongAdd Account/strong/li liTap on strongMicrosoft Exchange/strong/li liFill in the information for your company's Exchange account. You may need to get this from your IT department. /li liCheck the Mail, Calendars or Contacts sliders as necessary. /li /ol  Open the Calendars app and you're good to go.  <comment54470> I found your question a bit confusing. Could you say exactly what you're trying to do, in one sentence? Please include the program(s) you want to use for each piece. <comment54534> Are you using Exchange for email? <comment54609> @Timothy: Without installing ITunes, and without attaching my IPad3 to my PC, I want to synchronize my IPad calendar with my Outlook calendar. <comment54610> @Matt: Yes, using Exchange <comment54625> @BrentArias Wow, that's totally not what I thought the question wasâ€”I thought you wanted a way to auto-accept iCal invitations with Outlook or something. <comment54716> I will accept this as my answer, even though my client's security policy forbids that my personal IPad has exchange account information. <comment54729> Sometimes they allow you to have exchange on there as long as you have a passcode on the iPad. Is this the case or do they have any mobile device access disabled?
