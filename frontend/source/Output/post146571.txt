Format of mail from Apple Mail version 7.3 <body> My work colleagues, who use Outlook, complain that the e-mails I forward to them are not always readable, or have a lot of attachments.  Is there anything I can change on my side to prevent this from happening?   <comment172693> who is you email provider (Google, MSN, others ? <comment172695> There is a huge difference between "not readable" and "lot of attachments". Which problem do you want to focus on?
