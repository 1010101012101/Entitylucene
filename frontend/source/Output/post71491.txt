Native Vectromagic-style image-orthogonalization software for OSX? <body> I am stucked: I have a poor rasterized image. I have 10.7 OSx. How can I vectorize this image like with Vectormagic, dropping unnecessary basis vectors, and do small image manipulation?  My friend is suggesting me the Adobe Professinal package and Adobe Cloud. Is there any app as simple as ProCreate in iPad for OSx?  <comment83066> Vectormagic works fine on a Mac. <comment83774> @NathanGreenstein thank you, clarified -- also looking for small editing in the orthogonalization -app, not found in OSX.
