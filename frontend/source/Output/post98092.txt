Macbook External Display no Signal <body> I use MBP 13" early 2011 and tried to connect with external moniter ACER X163w but the monitor displays a "no signal" error.  I use official cable Display MiniDVI to VGA and run OS X 10.6.8.  Might the external monitor be too small or how else can I troubleshoot this?  hr  [Update] I have tried on my bigger monitor 25". Still says no display. it seem the problem is with my current OSX. I searched in google, some people also have same problem.  <answer98100> Here are some troubleshooting steps that I would try:  h2Reset the System/h2  Reset your Mac's parameter RAM and SMC  h2Try another Cable/h2  Although you are using the official MiniDVI to VGA adapter, it is possible that it might be damaged, so I would try connecting your monitor with another official adapter.   h2Reset the Resolution/h2  ol liStart up in Safe Mode (kbdPower/kbd + kbdShift/kbd on startup)/li liApple Menu = System Preferences/li liChoose codeDisplays/code from the codeViews/code menu./li liSelect another resolution and refresh rate./li liRestart./li /ol  h2Software Update/h2  It is also possible that you need to update to Lion (Maybe even Mountain Lion if you want).  h2Other Links and Resources/h2  Another Apple user who was using a Powerbook with the Acer x163W had issues too. That question was answered here and recommends a different monitor because of the Acer monitor's lower resolution than his Mac.   <answer123790> I had the same problem and what worked for me was Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC). I did it couple of times.  <answer125592> Resetting NVRAM / PRAM did the trick for me (having mavericks).  <answer196050> I had the same problem and I used codegfxCardStatus/code v2.3 to switch to Discrete only graphics card and now it works.  <answer233667> strongChanging the resolution/strong of the external monitor, in the system preferences,  usually solves the problem for me. I can then switch back to the optimal one, and the image stays on. No restart is needed.  <answer277758> One thing to try- I was getting the 'No signal' message on my external monitor, and couldn't work out why it wouldn't connect, as I was using the correct cable and it has worked many times before.   After trying many things, I unplugged the cable from my laptop, turned it upside down, and plugged it in again. It worked! So, unlike a USB, this cable fits both ways, but only works if it's the correct way up. When it's the right way up, it has a little image of a rectangle on it. (This may differ depending on your cable.)  I know, super obvious, but I was puzzled for a bit.  <answer282983> I had a similar problem that I solved by passing the HDMI signal through a powered HDMI Splitter box from Matrix.  <answer293488> ï£¿ - System Preferences - Display  Press kbdOption/kbd - "Detect Displays" on bottom right corner  If fails, try to tick "show mirroring options in the menu bar when available"br On AirPlay menu bar, try different option and see if second display responds.  <comment115125> Can you confirm that the external monitor that you tried works by connecting it to another computer? <comment115135> @sameetandpotatoes Yes, i had confirm it. I normally use the monitor for my PC and it work well <comment115136> And does the MiniDVI to VGA work with other displays? <comment115140> @BartArondson I don't know yet. I will try tomorrow testing it with my Friend Monitor <comment115141> I already have the latest OSX version and firmware. But now i will try to reset with safe mode. Do you have any suggestion what refresh rate and resolution i should use? <comment115142> A fairly low resolution because your monitor will not support a higher resolution than your Mac. <comment115826> Already tried this. But still no result :( <comment115834> GusDeCool, I never asked you this but in your `Display Preferences` in `System Preferences`, is the external monitor detected? <comment115965> @sameetanpotatoes No, my mac not detected external monitor in system preferences. <comment308341> You can't change the resolution on a monitor you can't detect. <comment349553> It shouldn't fit both ways, unless you used excessive force.
