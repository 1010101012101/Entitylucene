Change location of notification center alerts <body> Is it possible to change where alerts in the notification center appear on the screen? Alerts appearing in the top right tend to cover up work I'm doing more often than not and I would prefer, say, the bottom right corner of the screen.  If this is not possible, is it perhaps possible to change which screen the notifications appear on?  <answer79167> Unfortunately, you can't change the screen position of the Notification Center Alerts and Banners. This is a huge gripe of mine as well, and I highly encourage you to complain about this issue to Apple here: http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html  Hopefully they will one day change this. I also have not been able to find or formulate any hacks.  I, too, am annoyed by it covering up controls in my modeling applications, tabs in my browser, etc.  You can move the Notification Center to another screen, however your entire menu bar goes with it. When you have more than one monitor active, open up System Preferences  Displays  Arrangement. Click and drag the white bar inside one of the squares representing your current primary monitor and drag it to another monitor.  Good luck, and keep spreading the word that we need to tell Apple to make this experience better.  <answer131909> Swipe with two fingers on the banner pop up and it will remove it. Not the best answer but convenient for when I need to access a control or tab.  supSource: http://www.cultofmac.com/189192//sup  <answer181027> You can adjust the time the notification is displayed on the screen:   In a terminal window type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime SECONDS /code/pre  Where SECONDS is the number of seconds the notice will remain visible.  Default is 5 seconds.  Log out and in again to activate the setting.  http://www.defaults-write.com/notification-center-change-banners-display-time  <answer260489> spex's helpful answer still applies as of macOS Sierra (10.12), unfortunately.
