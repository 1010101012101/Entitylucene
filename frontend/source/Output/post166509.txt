Screen Recording - NO COMPRESSION <body> I'm looking to record my screen similar to how Quicktime does it, but I need zero-compression, since I need the pixel colors to remain correct.  Basically, I need a automated series of screenshots, if that's possible - lossless PNG at half-second intervals.  Are there scripts or other tools to do this?  <answer166725> perhaps you'd like ScreenFlow; it offers lossless compression. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XFmXP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment195175> I use [Camtasia 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camtasia-2/id478330793?mt=12) which works great for me. I have no idea if it compresses the output at all though. I suppose you could check with them and see. <comment195188> What rate of pictures is acceptable and which codecs / still image formats are acceptable to you? <comment195191> You say no compression, but would lossless compression be acceptable?  I suspect it's only lossy compression you object to; is that correct? <comment195265> @bmike - png, every half-second?
