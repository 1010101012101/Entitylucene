I've tried every thing that could help but nothing has worked so far as i know.  <comment373694> Welcome to Ask Different.  Do you have a computer (PC or Mac) with iTunes installed on it?  If so, have you plugged it into the computer using the USB cable that came with your phone?  (The charging cable). You say you tried everything, what is everything?  We would love to help but if you can tell us exactly what you have tried you may get some good answers.  Cheers! <comment373695> i went to  the iTunes store and plugged my charger port in and phone in and it could not access my phone because it said i had to go to my settings which i could not access cause i could not access my phone <comment373696> Not the iTunes Store, but rather the iTunes app.  On the PC/Mac. <comment373697> i have iTunes already on my laptop
