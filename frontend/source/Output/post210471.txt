from where can i download el capitan image other than mac app store? <body> In my college mac app store is blocked so can someone please provide me a link to direct download el capitan from web?  <answer210473> There's nowhere other than the Mac App Store where you can trust an installer to not give you a virus. If you have any place near your college with free wifi, going there to download El Capitan would be your best bet.  Alternatively, if you know anyone off campus with a Mac, you can have them download the installer from the App Store and then get it to you by giving you a flash drive or by using an online service like Copy (a Dropbox-like service that gives you 15GB for free).
