Safari: get URLs of images displayed in Web Inspector <body> How do I get the list of the resources loaded in Safari's Web Inspector? strong(Web Inspector  Resources  Images)/strong  My goal is to download all images shown in the inspector.  These are the manual steps:  ol liopen web inspector (CMD + Shift + I; Develop  Show Web Inspector)/li liclick the "Resources" tab/li liNavigate to your desired resource (fonts, images, scripts, stylesheets)/li liCMD + double-click the desired resource. This loads your desired image/script/css in a new Safari tab./li liclose web inspector/li licopy resource's URL (CMD + L, CMD + C) and close the tab (CMD + T)./li lirepeat for the remaining resources./li /ol  I think this should work with JavaScript / AppleScript.  Thanks.  <comment316093> How would your Applescript know the resource you want the URL for? And, probably more important, once you have the URL what do you want to do with it (details on that might open the door for other approaches to the problem)? <comment316132> I imagine that Safari is able to list the URL for each element displayed under 'Resources'. I want to download the images that are visible in the web inspector (see my edit above).
