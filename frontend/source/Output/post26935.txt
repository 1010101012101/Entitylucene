Get back some colors in Finder's sidebar <body> Since Lion, every item in the Finder's sidebar are gray. I miss the colors, as they were helpful to quickly find a specific item.br The problem is the same in Open File dialog box.  Do you know of a way to strongget back some colors in the Finder's sidebar/strong?  I'm ok to modify files owned by the System (such as system images), but I'm not ok to use SIMBL. This project seems nice, but I don't want to use it.  <answer27175> You aren't alone in wanting the color back.  Unfortunately, it looks as if the Finder code actually shifts the hue from the fully-colored icon resources that are included (see the Go menu in Finder, which has the colored versions).    According to a commenter on this MacThemes Forum thread, the developer documentation actually details how to shift the hue in the same way that Finder does; with the associated speculation that we'll see grey icons in every app that has a sidebar in the future.  Looks to me as if you can bite the bullet and use ColorfulSidebar (with SIMBL) or live with the grey.  <comment30819> What is the problem you have with SIMBL? At the moment using it with the ColorfulSidebar bundle is the easiest way to get the color back into the sidebar. <comment30821> My main problem is stability. I have had some bad experience with it, and try to stay away from it. <comment30823> ah, didn't know it had issues; I'll keep an eye out for you, since I'm in the same boat. <comment30907> When you know the mechanism of injection it uses to modify apps, you prefer to stay away from it. Nice hack, but an hack anyway. <comment31018> Care to elaborate on the mechanism you're referring to? <comment31123> I have updated the answer to link to SIMBL homepage and a plugin using SIMBL to do just that.
