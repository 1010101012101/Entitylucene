Watching downloaded iTunes movies after they're removed <body> I haven't yet bought any movies on iTunes since I want to have this question answered, and I haven't been able to find it here/in FAQs/forums/etc.  If I buy and download a movie, and keep it on an external hard drive, would I be able to watch it even if iTunes removes the movie from their store? Does the DRM expire and force you to re-download it after some time (meaning that you've lost it, since it's no longer on the store)?  <comment353629> I just wanted to let you know I've voted to close this question. My reasoning is that unless someone here has ever purchased a movie that has since become unavailable on iTunes, we'd only be _guessing_. My guess is that you'd be fine as your iTunes account will have a record of the purchase. However, this is a guess and you'd really be better off contacting Apple directly and asking this somewhat _hypothetical_ question. <comment353985> Got it, thanks.
