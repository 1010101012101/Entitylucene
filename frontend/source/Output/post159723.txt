Mac OSX not automatically remapping windows key to cmd <body> I'm currently using a Cooler Master Quickfire Ultimate keyboard that works perfect with Windows 7. However, whenever I have it plugged into my Macbook pro (running OSX 10.9.5), the default mappings don't seem to work.  I've used other keyboards, and the windows key will always re-map to cmd on mac. However, on my new keyboard, this isn't the case. The windows key doesn't seem to do or change anything. The alt key also doesn't seem to get mapped to anything initially.  My ctrl key maps correctly to ctrl on mac, but this leaves me without a command, or an option key.  I went into the "Modifier Keys" panel, and selected my keyboard on the list. Changing command to map to the ctrl key does remap cmd from mac to ctrl on my windows keyboard. Changing the mac ctrl to map to whatever the default "cmd" key is (in this case, should be the windows symbol key), does not work.   This means, when I'm trying to run a program and have to execute commands with the mac ctrl, I have to keep switching the modifier keys around.  I've tried using karabiner to remap keys, but can't seem to figure it out. I looked on the XML key list, but can't figure out how to remap the windows key to the mac ctrl, and the command key to the windows ctrl. How would I go about fixing this?  <answer159726> I fixed the issue!  Turns out that on this keyboard, doing fn + f12 actually disables the windows key. This was turned on by default. This is why nothing was working when I would press the windows key. I pressed fn + f12 again and now everything works :| weeks of frustration all due to me not looking at my keyboard layout :(  <comment187699> You should post your edit as an answer below.
