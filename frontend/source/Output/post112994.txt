Weather App in iOS 7 - can't get the top location to delete or move <body> I can move or delete any of the locations on the list except the one at the top. Help.  <answer112997> The reason is that the one at the top is always based on current location - meaning it's not a favorite you've set, it's using the GPS to get your location.  All the others are configurable.  <comment132625> @Nina You're very welcome...  please upvote and accept as the answer if this was helpful to you :) <comment132629> With iOS 5 and 6, you could remove that location by disabling a "local weather" setting. That has been removed in iOS 7.
