Is there a complete list of all hidden keyboard shortcuts in OSX? <body> I keep discovering keyboard shortcuts that are not listed anywhere under preferences. For example, I discovered here that kbd⌥ ALT/kbdkbd⌘ Cmd/kbdkbdE/kbd will eject all partitions on a disk when a partition is selected. How the heck do people find these shortcuts, and where can I find more?  <answer232021> Not sure if this is a complete list, but this is a pretty good start from Apple:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236  Here is another link to an image of the shortcuts:  http://dashkards.com/img/dashkard-macosx-general.png  <answer232061> Quite a few keyboard shortcuts vary on different Macs, especially the laptops, so that is one good reason it is not easy to find a 100% complete list.  There is a super in-depth guide, here which was designed to show developers which shortcuts emnot/em to use, but seems to be the best go-to guide for the comprehensive ins-and-outs of keyboard shortcuts in OSX.  I'd also reccommend browsing around more on that same site (https://developer.apple.com), although I didn't see a definitive shortcut guide yet.  I've learned about many of the shortcut keys (including the ⌥-modifiers like the one you describe) by reading through the  Apple Pro Training Series books, by Peachpit Press.  <comment283437> Unfortunately, neither shows ⌥⌘E! (Only the unmodified ⌘E is listed on the first link.)
