How can I upgrade all my Pages '09 documents to Pages '13? <body> I have a very substantial body of Pages 09 documents that I work on.  I've upgraded to Pages '13 recently.  Now, every time I open one of those old documents to work on it, I am greeted with the following dialog upon my first keypress:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aWA1Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to mass upgrade them?  Or to default this behavior to "Upgrade Already!!"  <answer226995> I was able to fix this by doing the following steps:  ol liCreate a new pages document, and just throw in whatever text. Save it./li liA .pages file is actually a .zip file, so right click on that and unzip it./li liIn your 09 pages file, right click and select "Show Package Contents"/li liCopy everything from the Index directory of your 09 pages doc to the Index directory of the new one./li liZip up your new one, the one you unzipped and copied in the 09 index files./li liRename the zip file you just created with a .pages extension/li liOpen in pages./li /ol  <comment275688> I think they're asking if they can do it en-masse: the current method works but is slow. <comment275694> That doesn't make it a wrong answer. You could create a script to go through these steps, I don't think it deserves a down vote. <comment275696> Then such a script should be implemented. It's not directly wrong, but for someone without skill, it's not helpful. <comment277430> "It's not helpful" It literally shows the user how to solve their problem. I don't know how to write a script for it but I worked hard to come to this solution for myself. I decided to post it here to help this and other users dealing with this problem. It's better that I keep my mouth shut because I'm not a Unix programmer?
