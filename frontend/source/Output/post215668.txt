VLC command works in Terminal but not Automator <body> If I run this in terminal it works fine  precode/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I rc http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/select/mediaset/http-icy-mp3-a/vpid/bbc_radio_fourfm/format/pls.pls --sout '#standard{mux=raw,access=file{overwrite},dst=/Users/person/Documents/scripts/r4.mp3,display=novideo}' --run-time=1800 --stop-time=1800 /code/pre  But if I run it in Automator (using Run Shell Script) I get this result and it doesn't work:  precode "VLC media player 2.2.1 Terry Pratchett (Weatherwax)",  "Command Line Interface initialized. Type `help' for help. ",  "&gt; Shutting down. " /code/pre  I have messed around with PATH and .bash_profile to no avail. What am I doing wrong?  <answer215903> It's most likely due to the VLC RC client wanting an Xterm interactive shell instead of a non-interactive shell, or some weirdness with the VLC OS X app still attempting to launch (It's bouncing in my dock while it runs).  In any case, a simple work around is to have automator launch a script to run in terminal.  The script would be simply:  precode#/bin/bash /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I rc http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/select/mediaset/http-icy-mp3-a/vpid/bbc_radio_fourfm/format/pls.pls --sout '#standard{mux=raw,access=file{overwrite},dst=/Users/person/Documents/scripts/r4.mp3,display=novideo}' --run-time=1800 --stop-time=1800 /code/pre  It should have execute permissions (chmod +x)  Then from Automator, you launch it like you normally would. In this case, I had Automator "Run Shell Script" of  precodeopen -a Terminal /path/to/script.sh /code/pre  Note you may want to add the code--play-and-exit/code option, otherwise VLC will stay open even after the 1800 seconds. By default, it will stop at the end of the playlist and wait. code--play-and-exit/code will tell it to quit when the playlist ends (in this case a single file).  strongAlternatively/strong, you can directly launch the script with a double click, skipping Automator completely, if you change the suffix to strong.command/strong. That may be more direct, depending on your actual goal.  <answer216648> I just want to record the radio at scheduled times. This seems to do this trick for me, just as you suggested:  precodeopen -a Terminal /Users/me/Documents/scripts/r4.sh /code/pre  It does fire up its own Terminal window, which I was hoping to avoid, but I can live with that.   Thank you.  <comment260533> Please add the complete content of your automator action <comment260558> It's just      Run Shell Script     /bin/bash Then the code above <comment260849> Would it be easier to have it run a bash script? Or launch a term and do it from Terminal. It can still be non-interactive.
