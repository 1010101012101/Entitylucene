Time Machine + FileVault on Lion or Mountain <body> If I stop the backup it says: "now encrypting...", is the data saved "not encrypted" before being encrypted? Can I make it "always encrypted"?  Non-encrypted transfers are a problem for me.  <answer65948> Time Machine on 10.7/10.8 uses the same encryption as any other non-system disk. When you first enable it, OS X has to encrypt the entire disk, which takes a while. The status "Encrypting" just means that it's still working on that.  You can check on the status with codediskutil cs list/code in Terminal. Mixed in with other info, you'll see something like:  precodeSize (Total):       124190560256 B (124.2 GB) Size (Converted):   2539913216 B (2.5 GB) /code/pre  That's 2.5 out of 124.2GB complete. Once the disk is fully encrypted, it's done for good and you'll basically never see that status again.
