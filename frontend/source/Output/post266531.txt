Checking Apple  About this Mac  Memory i got the following  precodeYour Mac contains 2 memory slots, each of which accepts a 1600 MHz DDR3 memory module. /code/pre  Which seems to suggest not, but i wondered if DDR4 was even around at the time my mac was made, is Ram a backwards compatible upgrade like placing a Sata SSD in a 10 year old device ?   <answer266538> No, the Mid-2012 MacBook Pro is in no way upgradable to DDR4 RAM.  To use DDR4 RAM a lot of things must be compatible with DDR4 - one of those is the CPU itself. The Intel CPU in the mid-2012 MacBook Pro does not support DDR4 RAM.  And no, DDR4 was not around in mid-2012. It was released to the market in 2014.  <comment334198> DDR3 and DDR4 have [different chip carrier designs](http://www.ocinside.de/review/adata_premier_4x4gb_ddr4_2133/) are are not physically the same.
