Iphone 4 - Verification Required <body> I've been using my App Store through my Apple Id for a while and everything has been normal, now all of a sudden when i want to update an app or to download a free app -after putting my password- a pop-up message appears entitled: Verification Required, asking me to verify my payment info. In my phone's account settings, the payment information is set on NONE since ever, still there's a red message up saying: You must verify your payment info before you make purchases. The thing is, I don't have any payment info, that is why i only use free apps. what to do?  <answer196995> Select Verify Payment Info, and under Credit Card, just choose None. If this doesn't work, close the App Store and go to Settings  App Store  Tap on your Email  View Apple ID  Payment Information  None.   This should fix the issue.   <comment235471> I had this a few times also, i fixed it by downloading another free app that i haven't downloaded before. I had to verify my payment info also, but at that time the option "none" was possible
