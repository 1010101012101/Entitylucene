Characters do not echo in OS X terminal unless I hit the delete key <body> As the title states, when I open up terminal to type a command, I cannot see what I am typing, it is as if the terminal is frozen. I can still execute commands when I hit return, I just cannot see what I am typing.   The weird part is that when I hit the delete key, I am suddenly able to see what I am typing, and the terminal functions normally until I run the command.  As well, when I hit delete the header at the top of the terminal window changes from:  name - bash - 80x24   to:  name - 37m - bash - 80x24  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you  edit: Thanks for all the help, I've tried some of the suggestions. Creating a new Admin account and opening terminal seemed to do the trick; I can type in terminal in this new account without pressing delete. Any ideas for my main account?

This may not be the issue, but it could make troubleshooting easier.  It may be the case that you have some profile script that changes the colors. Within codeTerminal.app/code, type the following command to start codebash/code on a clean slate (without executing any profile scripts):  precodebash --noprofile --norc /code/pre  If you no longer face the text visibility issue, then check all the profile scripts (some may not be present) like code/etc/profile/code, code~/.profile/code, code~/.bash_profile/code, code~/.bashrc/code, look for any ANSI escape sequences and remove those.  <answer135564> Your prompt is messed up, specifically PS1:  precodePS1=$[\033]0;37m] /code/pre  that's missing a lot of escape characters (code\e[/code) needed for the colors (and most useful parameters for a PS1). That's also why you get the code37m/code in the terminal window title. Try setting it to something different by running:  precodeexport PS1="\e[0;31m[\h:\W \u]\$\e[m " /code/pre  and see if that works. It should give a red (thats code\e[0;31m/code) prompt showing hostname (code\h/code), current working directory (code\W/code) and logged in user (code\u/code) inside brackets code[]/code and the bash exit status of the previous command (code\$/code). Note that at the end the color is reset to the default of the session with code\e[m/code .  If the above worked, you only have to find out from which configuration file your "bad" PS1 comes from: look for an "codeexport PS1=/code" line in code~/.profile/code, code~/.bash_profile/code, code~/.bashrc/code, (as M K already suggested in his answer) and put in the above version.  There are a lot of answers around here with helpful colors codes and inputs for configuring the PS1, like this one for example.   <comment160559> 1) update your post with the output of the command (typed directly) `/usr/bin/env` 2) Do you have a ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, or ~/.bash_profile in your home directory? 3) Please test this behavior in another user account and report back. Create a new administrative account in System Preferences  Users & Groups and see if the same behavior occurs. <comment160670> This worked! I'm a bit new at this, so thanks for your help
