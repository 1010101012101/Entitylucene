Listing all files installed by some MacPorts package <body> How to list all files that was installed   by some MacPorts package?  For example in Funtoo (or in Gentoo) I can achieve the same with a command:  codeequery b [package name]/code  <answer47547> precodeport contents installed_port_name /code/pre  <answer116537> In my case the CFLAGS LDFLAGS were necessary.   precode# ensure libyaml is installed port install libyaml +universal  # if you like you can check the location of the installied files (especially the .h file) # port contents libyaml  # now configure with these options CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include/ "  LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib/" ./configure make sudo make install /code/pre  <comment107434> and for anyone interested, the reverse lookup (which port provided a file) is `port provides filename`
