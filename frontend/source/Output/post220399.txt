Re-using an ejected flash drive <body> I tried to properly eject a flash drive by moving it into Trash. It went up in that little puff of smoke. Now when I try to reuse the drive by plugging it back into the computer, it does not show up in my Finder. What gives? (I am running Yosemite.)  <answer220405> It sounds like you might have dragged it out of the Sidebar on your Finder Window. Try this: plug the drive back in, and then hit kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd C /kbd  to go to your Computer view. You should see all your connected drives there; just drag the drive you want back to the Sidebar.  <answer220409> The little puff of smoke was the giveaway…  Next time, notice that in the sidebar, removable drives have a little up arrow.br Click that to eject.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WGpRo.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, select the drive itself &amp; use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd E /kbdbr or right click in the drive's contents &amp; select "Eject my SD Card"  <comment266746> Did you tried to reboot ? <comment266752> Cmd+C is copy? Just keep on doing Cmd+Up Arrow until you reach the top level and you'll see all the drives there. <comment266753> It's cmd/shift/c - I corrected it
