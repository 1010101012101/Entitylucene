Yosemite three-finger lookup not working <body> I have enabled the three-finger lookup, but it is not working since I upgrade to Yosemite. How to fix it?  <answer151309> Have you tried looking into System Preferences  Trackpad? I can't tell if you are referring to Mission Control swipe up with three fingers, but that's definitely still under the menu in trackpad and can be enabled.   <answer176570> Are you running Scroll Reverser? It causes the bug. Just quit Scroll Reverser.  <answer189289> I had a similar issue and used these two commands to disable and then re-enable bluetooth. Seemed to revive my issues.   However I have noticed that 3-finger lookup works in some applications and not in others. For instance no problem in my web browsers but not so great in my vm or a few Microsoft products.  <answer201719> The problem is with force touch if you have one of the new macbook pro - if it's on force touch under trackpad - point and click - Lookup and data detectors then change it to tap three fingers and it should work.   <comment178062> You can always hover over the word and press Command-Control-D. <comment178135> No, I am referrring to looking up a word in the dictionary. <comment178145> That's still under the trackpad menu! It's the first tab, "Point and Click" but it seems to be disabled by default in Yosemite. You can just check it again and it should work (worked for me). <comment178147> Thanks, I do have checked, and everything is ticked... But still not working. <comment205205> @0942v8653 nice tip. I didn't know that one. <comment208663> Why the down vote? I am indeed using it! I see. This is interesting. <comment332206> This worked for me when using my MBP as a laptop without a Magic Trackpad 2 that was in range and connected via bluetooth. <comment354632> This was the thing for me. They somehow changed the default. Thanks for the answer.
