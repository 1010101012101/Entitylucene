Can't download an app <body> I am trying to install the pokemon go app.  I had it before and had to delete it as it was stuck on loading.  Now I cannot get it to down load at all.   I have more than enough space on my phone. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8E6cj.jpg" alt="enter image description here" Notice the circle is greyed out, this happens when I touch it to download. It will not change or go back to get.  I have deleted from phone and iCloud as well.  <comment328471> Try rebooting your device. If that doesn't work, tap the **Updates** button 10 times; this will flush the App Store cache.
