Change input setting in mac keyboard <body> In my keyboard when I pressed this key  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/toj7z.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then I get/display  strong'§'/strong (emwith shift+key/em - strong'±'/strong ) instead of what  expected.   How can I set it to work properly?  Also after  Googling I found this site but this did not help me.  <answer85319> My guess is that your machine thinks the keyboard "type" is English (International) ISO, when it is really English (USA) ANSI.

Does this change things? <comment98305> That's the exact button as programmed for a mac keyboard. You might find settings in your keyboard preferences to change this manually. <comment98313> @TomGewecke- yup...i checked it...US is Checked..:) <comment98323> Thanks, that is helpful (assuming British is NOT also checked), and I modified my answer slightly.
