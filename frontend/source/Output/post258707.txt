macOS Sierra, system size is 180+ GB! <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) running macOS Sierra, the Mac started to be slow due to storage.  When I've checked my storage I was shocked, from 250 GB I have, 180 GB was allocated to the System it self!  I've checked my friends storage and found that the System is only 30 GB!  How can I manage this and why do I have that much storage allocated to the System?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtWRQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer258711> Download Diskkeeper and analyze your hard drive.     OmniDiskSweeper will show you the files on your drive, in descending   order by size, and letting you decide what to do with them. Delete   away, but exercise caution.   Omnidiskkeeper will show detail of space usage: br / Select System and start cleaning. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/94hIu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment323497> Im using clean my mac, its the same, and can't do anything with system files <comment323499> omnidiskkeeper can show how big the system directory is,just click in and delete,or can you take a snapshot of your system usage? <comment367362> @klanomath The newer one has far more views and the accepted answer has named the software correctly, I often vote to close the other way round and made a judgement call in this case as I would do normally. Do you feel strongly it should have been the other way round?
