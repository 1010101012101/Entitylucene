Restore an older version of iCloud keychain <body> I saved an important password in an iCloud keychain, then deleted it there, and then forgot the password. Pretty dumb, I know. Still, is it somehow possible to get an older version of that keychain that still keeps the password?  <answer262096> Restore either code~Users/[User]/Library/Keychains/login.keychain/code or code~Library/Keychains/System.keychain/code ( Select 'Keep both' option in Time Machine)  Open the newly restored file with the keyChain Access app.  You will be able to open the older entries in the restored file, and copy, or export them to your live keychain.  <comment197818> Do you use Timemachine <comment198035> @markhunte Yes, but how does it help? <comment198036> I am now not in front of my Mac. But if you go to your user library and then keychains. Select the keychains folder and make a manual backup. I.e make a copy somewhere. Then with the original keychain folder open. Go into timemachine and use it to try and find the date you had the password.it should allow you to restore the folder. And then you can get the password back. (Write it down)You can then restore back to a version done today in time machine.  If this works let me know and I will add it as an answer when in front of my mac <comment357626> This is for the login keychain, not the iCloud keychain.
