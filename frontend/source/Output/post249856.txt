Git Config Error in Xcode <body> When I opened xcode and tried to make a macosx app, this weird message came up.  Is this a glitch or a virus, as Apple wouldn't say something like this. It does not look like a system message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gznPK.png" alt="this is weird"  <answer249869> No, this isn't a virussup1/sup.  It seems that your name and email address are not set up properly in Git. Go to Xcode Preferences and then Accounts, select the repository, and check the username.  You can also do this via the command line:  precodegit config --global user.email "you@example.com" git config --global user.name "Your Name" /code/pre  sup1/sup: The message content can be found in /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/libexec/git-core/git (git version 2.7.4 (Apple Git-66) lines 11416-11424).  <answer250020> When you are done configuring git with   precodegit config --global user.email "you@example.com" git config --global user.name "Your Name" /code/pre  you can type codegit config --list/code to check the content:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hPzu3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer251502> Although the correct answer has been given above, that the message is by no means a virus, a more general explanation is due:  Xcode is a git client. It maintains git repositories for its projects, is able to create and manage them, and provides nice UI for many day-to-day git tasks.  Usually, when you setup Xcode, you create one or more "accounts" within Xcode, used to identify you against the App-Store and other entities, so that Xcode can save you lots of tedious mucking about setting up trusts, certificates, etc. when developing for iOS and Mac.   When you do that --- Xcode will also auto-config git for you, automatically creating the .gitconfig file, with Name, e-mail and the rest.   However, if you refrain from creating an initial account, and create a Mac project right away - your git setup is incomplete, and git itself will produce the dialog depicted in the question.  You can either simply configure .git as usual, providing it the basic info it needs, OR go back and add an Xcode account (in Xcode preferences) and let Xcode complete the git settings for you.  <comment310077> It's not a virus. It's a standard error message from the git software. <comment310083> [Obligatory link](https://xkcd.com/1180/) (xkcd). <comment310084> The OP might want to use `--global`. Could be worth briefly describing the difference. <comment310109> the "please tell me who you are" seems a bit personal for xcode so i can understand his skepticism <comment310139> You should usually use `--global` as `--local` applies only to the git repo you are currently in. <comment310159> @jksoegaard I agree with john cs - this is about the opposite of a typical error message that I would expect. Software systems that try to be too familiar with users are inevitably bound to raise eyebrows. <comment310163> Your answer just repeats the same information that was in that popup box without really answering his question. <comment310190> OP's question was, "is message a virus?" The first line of the reply says "no, this isn't a virus". How does this not answer the question? (Though it may be worth expanding the answer and mentioning the difference between --global and --local, as said above.) <comment310218> @ChrisCirefice I don't oppose to you agreeing with john cs. It is just a matter of fact that it is a standard error message from the git software. It's not a virus. <comment310221> @LÃ©oLam - Check the edit, it didn't say that before rany's edit. Though more than a one-line answer might be nice, instead of "no, this isn't a virus", a little explanation about why Xcode needs git to be set up before you build a project would make it a better answer. <comment310274> It is from this line in Git https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/ident.c#L335, the original message was updated here https://github.com/git/git/blame/master/ident.c#L335. <comment310276> This doesn't answer the question.  See [answer] <comment310327> I'm baffled by the comments here. "This came from Git" does not mean "this error message is normal." Can someone confirm that this is in fact the expected behavior of XCode when creating an App? If so it sounds like a bug.
