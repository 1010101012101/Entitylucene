How to display project name in minimized Xcode? <body> When Xcode project window is collapsed to dock it shows name of the current file: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uSbBn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to customize Xcode, so it will show project name in the dock, or "project_name - file_name"?  <comment219837> I suppose you could click on the project name in the `Project Navigator` before minimizing it so it shows it in the dock, or create a script that does it for you. <comment219859> And how should I remember the last file I work with? <comment219870> Use the **** `Go Back` button in XCode, it should take you right to it. <comment220062> Well, it's not simpler then just open that window and see the project name :)
