Macvim crashing about hourly <body> Any hints on stabilizing MacVim?  I have version "Custom Version 7.4 (73)" as shown in screenshot  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lCEKQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Typically MacVim is crashing when I am working on a emdifferent/em application - not when actually editing within vim.  <answer190667> I found an active github project that has fixed some bugs related to Yosemite.  Here is the repo:  https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim
