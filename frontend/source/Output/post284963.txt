Gray Exclamation Point when importing raw photos <body> I have been having difficulty with importing RAW photos from my Canon EOS 77D. I am able to see the thumbnail of all photos (which leads me to believe that perhaps photos can process my images.) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RiDvJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But when I click on a photo, I get the following (Please ignore the high ISO):img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQDda.png" alt="enter image description here"   What can I do so that I can see/edit my photos?  <answer284992> I checked Apple's Digital camera RAW formats supported by iOS 10 and macOS Sierra page and at present the Canon EOS 77D is not listed in terms of RAW format support.  I expect that support for your RAW format will be included in a future iOS and macOS software update.  In the meantime I would recommend you:  ul liprovide feedback to Apple/li liuse one of the other formats/li /ul
