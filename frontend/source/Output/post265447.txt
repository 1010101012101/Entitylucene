File Folder Monitoring <body> I have a task to create a way of monitoring a folder and files running on a MacOS 10.11 machine.  Basically what I want to accomplish is each time a new file is added to the folder send a notification to a monitoring URL and if after 30 minutes no files are added it will trigger an alert.  I am new to Mac OS programming but I have been tasked with this project and just looking for some suggestions on how to accomplish this  <answer265475> I assume you intend to build something on your own. Things to look into here are  ul licodelaunchd/code: Allows programs/scripts to be run based on certain conditions. Of special interest for you is probably the codeWatchPaths/code parameter which allows to watch a path/directory for changes and triggers a program/script if necessary. There emare/em race conditions involved here, but for your case you probably can catch them easily. The full format for launchd configuration files is available with codeman launchd.plist/code/li liShell/bash scripting: The code to execute if a file arrives probably isn't too complex, so some basic scripts should be enough/li liHow to send an email from command line? /li /ul  hr  On second thought, I would ignore the codeWatchPaths/code part completely. Just use codelaunchd/code to run a shell script every 30 minutes (or whatever is appropriate) which, if no new file has arrived since when-ever, sends a notification to wherever.  <comment332803> You didn't add details about the intended scope here. Folder monitoring can be done with Folder Actions and AppleScript/Automator, or with tools like Hazel, questions in this direction are on-topic. <comment332805> The intention is we have a folder that has incoming files and we want to know potentially when no new files have been moved to the folder in a specified amount of time. <comment332810> What will happen with the alert then, does it need to be shown to the user or does it need to trigger some other processing? <comment332813> It would send a notification to https://deadmanssnitch.com/ which would fire an email alert <comment332814> Then we would manually investigate why no files have been processsed
