Homebrew mass unstallation <body> Hello I am wondering if there is a way to uninstall all "programs" installed by homebrew? I was using it and installed programs that corresponded to programming or using C/C++ and used the terminal to compile it but will not be using it in a few months.  <answer198624> From codehomebrew/FAQ.md/code:     h1How do I uninstall Homebrew?/h1      To uninstall Homebrew, paste the command below in a terminal prompt.  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)" /code/pre      Download the uninstall script and run code./uninstall --help/code to view more uninstall options.   The following script also claims to completely uninstall homebrew.  <answer198625> According to the homebrew FAQ, to uninstall homebrew you use:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)" /code/pre  hr  If you don’t want to completely uninstall home-brew but just want to remove all packages installed by homebrew, I emthink/em this will do what you need (I’m not currently in a position to remove all of my packages to check):  precode#Loop while there are still package installed while [[ `brew list | wc -l` -ne 0 ]]; do     #Interate over each installed package     for EACH in `brew list`; do         #Uninstall each package         brew uninstall $EACH --force     done done /code/pre  I’ve enclosed the whole thing in a loop double check that after the first run all of the packages have been uninstalled—I’m pretty sure they will be due to the code--force/code option, but belt and braces...  <comment238580> Thanks for the help really appreciate it.
