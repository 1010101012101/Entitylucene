Brand new iMac, cannot login to anything <body> I received my brand new iMac today. During installation/startup, I was surprised to find that I could not log in to iCloud. I skipped, figuring it was a minor glitch and I would do it after setting up the new computer account.  I have discovered that I cannot log on to anything on this brand new computer. I get a different error phrasing with each app, but they all basically state that "An unknown error occurred." I contacted Apple, got bumped to level 2 support, and now we are working with engineering to diagnose. I thought I would see if anyone has any other ideas or similar experiences.  Here is what I know:  ol liThis started from the moment I turned the computer on for the first time, where you initially are supposed to login to iCloud./li liI cannot login to iCloud, iTunes, or the App Store from this iMac./li liWhen I login, each app gives a slightly different error message but they are all consistent./li liWhen I login, I get a spinning "wait" icon that lasts about 20-30 seconds, then a message comes up.  ul liApple app store and iTunes store says "an unknown error occurred"./li liiCloud says "Verification failed. An unknown error occurred."/li /ul/li liI can login to both icloud.com and appleid.apple.com on the new iMac without a problem./li liI can login to all of these apps on my Macbook Pro without a problem./li liI can login to all of these apps on my iPad 2 and iPhone 6 without a problem./li liMy wife cannot login to her own app accounts on this new iMac computer./li liI tried booting into safe mode, still could not login to anything./li liApple support had me make a secondary "test" account on the new iMac, still could not log in from there./li liI have tried wired ethernet, home WiFi, and AT&amp;T cellular WiFi via iPhone personal hotspot -- same problems./li liI reset the computer, and also reset the router and modem, no dice./li liWe ran Disk Utility, no problems./li liI tried changing the computer date to one day ahead, this did not help./li liWe reinstalled MacOS, that did not work./li /ol  Any help or insight would be tremendously appreciated. Fair warning, I have a duplicate post on the Apple forums just to broaden my net, sorry if that is inappropriate in any way.  <comment363348> You said that you tried wired, home WiFi, and a personal hotpot, but you never said how you verified that you were connected.  Are you able to browse the web?  Also, you said it gave you an error message - *what was that error message?* <comment363364> Yep, I can browse the web. The only thing I cannot do on this computer is login to anything requiring an Apple ID. See point #4 in my original post for the error messages I get from each app. <comment363375> There should be nothing preventing you from logging in especially *after* you reinstall macOS.  If I had to guess, I would bet that that particular machine was an "open box item" where the previous owner set it up and signed into iCloud with it only to return it but not deauthorize it. <comment363952> Maybe try to look at the logs when trying to log in in the App Store app. In Console.app, type `process:store` and hit `Enter`. Then try hit the `Clear` button in Console.app just before trying to log in in App Store, and see if any of the log that appears in Console.app would help diagnosing the problem.
