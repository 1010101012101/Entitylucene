Sharing Hotel Wi-Fi from MacBook via Airport Express <body> I am in a hotel that charges per device connected to their Wi-Fi.  I have a gen. 2 Airport Express connected to my MacBook, which is currently connected to the Wi-Fi, via Thunderbolt-Ethernet connection.  The "sharing" settings on my Mac are telling me I am sharing the Wi-Fi via the Thunderbolt-Ethernet connection and I have set up a network on the Airport Express, however the network from the Airport Express is not connected to the internet.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vodkn.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wMldP.png" alt=""  I can access media on my Mac and cast to my Apple TV, but the Apple TV can not access anything that requires a wider internet connection.  I imagine there is a particular setup to get this to work properly but I would appreciate the help.  <comment373633> This is a bit confusing.  WiFi is WiFi and Ethernet is Ethernet.  You can't connect to WiFi via Ethernet (Thunderbolt or otherwise).  This is like saying, you connected the battery in your car via the extension cord in your garage.  Can you clarify more about how you are connecting? <comment373635> Sorry if it was confusing.  MacBook is connected to wifi.  Airplay is connected to Mac via Thunderbolt-Ethernet.  Attempting to share internet from Mac to other devices via the Airplay. <comment373648> Welcome to Ask Different! :) Unfortunately I've had to close your question as it's still not clear. In your comment to @Allan you say you're trying to share the internet via AirPlay, but that's not what AirPlay is for. AirPlay is a technology for streaming audio/video content, photos and/or the screen of one device to another. It's not for sharing internet. However, if you can edit your question to clarify the 2nd sentence, provide your exact model of Mac and the type of devices you're trying to share the internet with, we can hopefully get you back on track. :)
