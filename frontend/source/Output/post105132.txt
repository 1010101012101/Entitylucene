Assign and recall windows with keyboard shortcuts <body> I would like to be able to strongassign/strong numbers to windows with a keyboard shortcut like:  kbdCmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd (different numbers for different windows or desktops)  and then strongrecall/strong them with a keyboard like:   kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbd1/kbd   The specific modifier does not matter much. I used to do this with AutoHotkey in Windows. Can I do this in Mac OS X?  <answer105381> You'll need a Mac-based macro program such as Keyboard Maestro by Stairways Software. Although its interface is very different, it's similarly powerful, if not more powerful than AutoHotkey. The program includes a tutorial and comprehensive documentation.  <comment139083> Thanks - before I buy this, how can I be sure that I can do what I asked above?
