Import XML Apple Music Playlist in iTunes <body> I have exported from iTunes the XML of a playlist followed on Apple Music (I have an active subscription Apple Music).  Now I want to reimport it again so, I do that in iTunes, sync iCloud Library, getting covers... But can't play tracks in the playlist anymore. When i look at the infos of the track you can see that :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WKzAP.png" alt="enter image description here"  The issue is the kind "internet audio stream" instead of "Apple Music AAC audio file" so that's probably why the "iCloud" status is in error.  So how can I do to be able to play again this Playlist ?  Thanks
