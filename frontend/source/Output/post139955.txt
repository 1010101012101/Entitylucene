Quick way to Print Multiple Emails <body> Using Mail.app, or exporting from same, is there a quick way to print all the emails from a single folder?  I have about 50 email messages in a folder and I need to print a copy of each one.  I know I could   ul liOpen each email/li liPrint it/li liRemove it from the tray (to conform it printing)/li liRepeat 50 times/li /ul  That, however, seems super time consuming. I'd rather be able to   ul liSomehow combine all the emails into a single document/li liPrint that/li liWalk away/li /ul  I know I can export to mbox, but I don't know of anyway to view a unified mbox as a single logical document (dealing with a combination of plain text, HTML formated, multi-part, attachments, etc)  <answer139958> I tried your request:  I selected 50 emails, then choose Print under File Tab.  It took some time to generate the print files, but then it showed me print preview for 50 emails.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdvzZ.jpg" alt="print"  Without proceeding (do not want to waist my toner), I see there is no problem in printing 50 emails all at once.  <comment164931> That's pretty funny — I guess modern iOS/Web stuff has me trained to think something like that wouldn't work.  Thanks!
