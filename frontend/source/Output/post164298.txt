Mail applescript stopped working on Yosemite <body> This script stopped working in Yosemite. Any suggestion would be much appreciated.  precodetell application "Mail" try       set _msgs_to_move to (a reference to (every message of mailbox "INBOX" of every account whose flagged status is false and was replied to is true))     set _msg_list to contents of _msgs_to_move     if (_msg_list's length &gt; 0) then         move _msgs_to_move to mailbox "messaggi letti"     end if     -- End update for 10.7.0 end try end tell /code/pre  I get the following error:     get every message of mailbox "INBOX" of every account whose flagged   status = false and was replied to = truebr   -- error number -1728 from   mailbox "INBOX" of every account   Thank you!  Michele  <answer164307> Thanks to  Buscar comment I solved it:  precodetell application "Mail" set accountlist to the name of every account try     repeat with n from 1 to (the number of items in accountlist)         set _msgs_to_move to (a reference to (every message of mailbox "INBOX" of the account (item n of accountlist) whose flagged status is false and was replied to is true))         set _msg_list to contents of _msgs_to_move         if (_msg_list's length &gt; 0) then             move _msgs_to_move to mailbox "messaggi letti"         end if     end repeat end try end tell /code/pre  <answer164310> Do you get the same results using  precodetell application "Mail" set _msgs_to_move to every message of inbox whose flagged status is false and was replied to is true     log (count of _msgs_to_move)  end tell /code/pre  <comment192606> does it work with single account? <comment192617> Good question! If I change this line like this it works on the account "myaccount":   set _msgs_to_move to (a reference to (every message of mailbox "INBOX" of the account "myaccount" whose flagged status is false and was replied to is true))  So I Guess I'll have to find a way to add a overarching loop through all the accounts? If you know how to do it already you'll save me sometime.... other ways I'll look thought is when I have time... <comment192629> Yes it seems to work and it is much simpler! Thanks!
