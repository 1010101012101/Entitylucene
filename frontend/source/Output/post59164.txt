How do I reassign the F3 key to another application? <body> I have a gesture for Expos√© so I need another button (the F3) to do the same. I'd love to replace F3 to show/hide the MacBartender app.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLclm.png" alt="Here&#39;s where I assign a keyboard shortcut to MacBartender"  Would it be possible to reassign this key for such a use? I have KeyRemap4MacBook installed but it does not allow for changing individual keys (I either change all my function keys or none at all).   <answer59165> FunctionFlip allows you to change the function keys individually.  <answer59315> KeyRemap4MacBook does allow changing individual media keys.  Save something like this as private.xml:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Change Expose to F19&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;B83A0F12-896A-42C4-AE87-1F24EE0B989E&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::EXPOSE_ALL, KeyCode::F19&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Press the ReloadXML button and enable the remapping in the first tab.  <comment68197> Worked perfectly, thanks very much! <comment68200> I'm glad it worked. If you click the check button under the voting options, you'll "accept" my answer as correct. (If I remember correctly, you'll get a few reputation from doing it, too.) <comment68202> Not to worry, I am a SO user myself. I couldn't do it because it was too soon and I was planning to come back anyway. ;) <comment68204> @Maiasaura OK. Thanks for the accept.
