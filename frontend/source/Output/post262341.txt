Error: org.macports.checksum for port py27-setuptools returned: Unable to verify file checksums <body> I'm attempting to upgrade to MacPorts 2.3.5 on a PowerMac running OS X 10.5.

Removing SSH means I lose access to the box. I'm not sure where the SSH/Python dependency comes from. I've built OpenSSH from sources, and the dependency does not exit in real life.  How do I finish the 2.3.5 upgrade?  <comment328678> The download size of only 315 bytes looks suspicious and indeed [https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-28.8.0.tar.gz](https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-28.8.0.tar.gz) returns an XML document containing **The specified key does not exist.** <comment328881> OK, thanks. It sounds like one of their scripts needs some work. I'll keep waiting for the fix. <comment329795> Did you resolve this? py27-setuptools @28.8.0 installed fine on my  iMac running 10.12.1. I'd say the upstream URL format has changed since the time of that ticket you found as it's now [this](https://pypi.python.org/packages/25/4e/1b16cfe90856235a13872a6641278c862e4143887d11a12ac4905081197f/setuptools-28.8.0.tar.gz#md5=43d6eb25f60e8a2682a8f826ce9e3f42) for 28.8.0 (found towards the bottom [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/28.8.0)). It looks unpredictable for any given version so I wonder if the portfile fetches it some other way - `pip` maybe?
