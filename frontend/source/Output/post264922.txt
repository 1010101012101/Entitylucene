Cannot fix iPhone 2G after last restore <body> I have an iPhone 2G that I had to jailbreak to unlock, and it was fine for a while, but now it's completely broken for some reason. Whenever I plug it in, it shows the low battery icon for 2 seconds, and then boots to the "Connect to iTunes" screen. Most solutions were to either boot with Redsn0w/3rd party utility or restore with iTunes. iTunes recognizes the device, yet when it starts to prepare the iPhone for restoration, the iPhone 2G's screen goes white with lines going up and down, and then crashes. It can only reboot after I unplug it for some time, and re-plug it back in. Third party utilities require DFU mode, which I cannot achieve because if I power down the device, it will no longer turn on. Any help would be much appreciated.
