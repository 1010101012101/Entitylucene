More resolutions available for rotated display (Dell P2715Q at 2560x1440) <body> I'm trying to run a newly bought P2715Q monitor at 2560x1440 resolution using HiDPI but the resolution isn't available:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/90yzMm.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I change the rotation to 90 degrees, however, the resolution 1440x2560 is there. Surely the monitor can display this resolution. So why is it only available when the display is rotated?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/maiNBm.png" alt="enter image description here"
