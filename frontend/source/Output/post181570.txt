Wallpaper flickering <body> I've noticed after updating to the latest OS X update 10.10.3 my emdesktop/em wallpaper flickers frequently.  The flickering will momentarily go if I have a window cover the location of flickering but it will appear again about 10 minutes later.  Could someone tell me how to resolve this? or at least troubleshoot the issue.  I have a Mac Mini (Late 2012).  UPDATE: Screenshot of my console as requested: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3lD5.png" alt="screenshot of console"  2ND UPDATE: Added screenshots of my screen settings and new console log. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1HCRy.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4gxke.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181654> Thanks for the Console log:  I see two item making problems with the User Interface (UI) in (WindowServer)  One is the VLC.app and the second one is the "Transmit application"  I know what is VLC app, so just disable (remove) it to test. (then download updated version)  Second one "Transmit" you know what it supposed to do but it is making problems. See if there is an update  or disable it.  <comment215940> 2 questions to clarify. what wall paper, and what does your console says looking at the "windowserver" is it switching/showing up constantly in the console log. type "WindowServer" in the filter to see it. <comment216025> I have updated my post with answers to your post. <comment216120> I have closed and terminated processes from both VLC and Transmit and I am still getting the flicking issue. <comment216121> so what does now the Console report for WindowServer ? give me all the lines regarding widowserver. could you also publish your screen settings. You said a specific location that is flickering, so it is not the whole screen? Just for fun, could you change your desktop background to plain color. <comment216281> Please see updated post, I have changed the colour of my desktop to solid grey, so far so good but I'll keep you updated as its quite temperamental. I I should note that the flickering isnt on the WHOLE screen, a thin line of grainy red blocks appear and flicker for about 10 minutes before they disappear again. I cant seem to capture a screenshot of them but if you want I can draw up a visualisation of them on Photoshop <comment216288> Thanks for the Update. Now that we know it is a external monitor, I would guess it is the cable. Why did you down vote my answer? <comment216301> I actually have two screens, the problem seems to occur consistently on one screen so I'm gonna try switching the cable and see what happens. (p.s. I didn't vote the answer down) <comment216304> Well, some douche bag did, who knows the answer but will not share.
