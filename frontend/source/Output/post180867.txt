How to change the PDF reader on Chome from Preview to Acrobat Reader on MacBook? <body> How can I change the PDF reader on Chrome from Preview to Acrobat Reader on MacBook? The Adobe program is much more versatile and I prefer that one to Preview. In my Plug-ins in Chrome the Adobe Acrobat has the option to be de-activated as if it is the program I am using now. But my Chrome automatically opens PDFs with Preview.  <answer180889> Step 1: Open Chrome and type "chrome://plugins" into the address bar at the top.  Step 2: Scroll down and find Chrome PDF Viewer.  Step 3: Click the "Disable" link to prevent PDFs from loading within Chrome.  Step 4: Click the "Enable" link on Adobe PDF plugin.
