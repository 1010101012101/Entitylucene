Play torrented video while downloading in uTorrent <body> I've seen this feature is available in uTorrent 3.0, but the mac version is only 1.8.7? How do I play torrents while they download on OS X?  <answer190925> Given the way torrents work ( piece from here, piece from there ) wether you can play a part before downloading the whole will depend on wether you have the part you want.   In short, maybe yes, maybe no.  <comment226708> Try Popcorn Time or ISOPlex. http://isoplex.isohunt.to/?lang=en&refname=&refurl= <comment226723> I'm not doing this as an illegal thing. I own the videos I'm torrenting, I'm just trying to figure out how to grab a few frames without downloading the whole blasted thing <comment226862> That's correct but is it possible to do that with uTorrent v. 1.8.7 for Mac (the latest Mac-version)?
