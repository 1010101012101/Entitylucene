Do the iPhone 7 and 7 plus cameras use the same sensor? <body> I am looking to upgrade to the latest iPhone mainly for the camera.  I am wondering if the iPhone 7 and 7 plus use the same camera sensor.  Specifically, will they handle the same in low light conditions.  I shoot a lot of low light photos and am curious if they will perform the same.    <answer271306> strongSHORT ANSWER/strong  If it was me and my main interest was in photography, I'd definitely opt for the iPhone 7 Plus over the iPhone 7. Don't get me wrong, both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have great camera systems, but the iPhone 7 Plus has a few features over the iPhone 7 because of its strongsecondary 56mm-equivalent "telephoto" lens system/strong. And, since you're main interest is in low light conditions, you should be aware that Apple markets the iPhone 7 Plus as being the one to use for low-light photography.  strongLONG ANSWER/strong  Let's start with the specs - below is a summary of the camera specs of each:  strongiPhone 7 Plus/strong  ul liPRIMARY CAMERA: Dual 12 MP (28mm, f/1.8, OIS strongand/strong 56mm, f/2.8), phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, quad-LED (dual tone) flash. This features: 1/3" sensor size @ 28mm, 1/3.6" sensor size @ 56mm, geo-tagging, simultaneous 4K video and 8MP image recording, touch focus, face/smile detection, and HDR (photo/panorama). Video recording at:   2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps, and 720p@240fps./li liSECONDARY CAMERA: 7 MP (32mm, f/2.2), face detection, HDR, and panorama.

They even produced a video to highlight this. It's called Midnight and you'll see that the iPhone being used is an iPhone 7 Plus (this is obvious when the user picks his iPhone up at about 5 seconds in).  In summary, with an iPhone 7 Plus you can use the 28mm-equivalent wide-angle lens using Photo mode, zoom up to 10x (digitally), and take snaps with an added depth of field effect using Portrait mode.  If you do a Google search I'm sure you'll find lots of info about the advantages of an iPhone 7 Plus camera system compared to the iPhone 7. I'm sure if you read some reviews you'll find some that tested each in low-light conditions for you to compare.  <comment341041> I don't believe Apple has ever revealed the exact specs for the camera sensor in either iPhone (detailed spec, I mean, not pixels, aperture, etc).  Have you checked the iFixIt site for teardown info on the both?
