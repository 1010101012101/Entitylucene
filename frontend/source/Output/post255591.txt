Paste multi-line text into Powerpoint <body> I'm trying to make a Powerpoint presentation containing source code examples (something along the lines of:  precodeif (date == 13) {     cout &lt;&lt; "Good luck!"; } /code/pre  Without fail, when I copy and paste this from my text editor (that has this text as plain text and not as any sort of rich text) all of the text ends up as a single line in my presentation.  Is there a way to paste plain text from the system clipboard into Powerpoint while preserving line breaks in the text?  <comment318356> I didn't purchase a Mac to continue to have to use Microsoft products, so I don't have PowerPoint installed, however it pastes fine in Keynote and also LibreOffice Presentation. I'm surprised it doesn't paste correctly in PowerPoint.
