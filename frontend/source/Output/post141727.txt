How can I activate a 2nd hand iPhone 3gs without a computer? <body> I have bought iPhone 3GS. But have not got a computer. How do I activate my phone?  <answer141728> I don't think it's possible. My advice is that you either buy a computer or build it yourself (this way is cheaper).  <answer141740> If it's just for activation, using emany/em computer with iTunes installed will do.  <comment167022> ...but he still has to buy the components right? This is not a an answer, this is bad advice. <comment167379> @CousinCocaine It might not be an answer but it's a solution. With what did you contribute, skippy?
