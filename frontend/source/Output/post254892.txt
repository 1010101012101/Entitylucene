When connect external display fullscreen app is badly positioned <body> I'm almost always using apps in fullscreen mode. But when I connect external display almost always this fullscreen apps are moved to another this external display and are badly positioned so half of screen is black. My current solution is to drag the window to another display via mission control (at least I think it's called like this :D) and then move it back. This fixes the issue, but it's annoying since I reconnect my external displays a lot.  Is this any known issue or even better, fix to this problem? I couldn't google it.  I'm using:br MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)br OS X El Capitan 10.11.6  Thanks in advance for any advice or solutions.
