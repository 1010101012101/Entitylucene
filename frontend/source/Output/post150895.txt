Ping Issues using Thunderbolt to CAT <body> Is anyone having a higher than usual ping when using a thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter? Or maybe the thunderbolt adaptor has a known issue?  Found this thread, Ping on Mavericks on late 2013 MacBook Pro slow and variable compared to Windows  but it doesn't look to cover hardwire connections.    <answer151904> So I did the test using the ping command in terminal  For Google.com  precodePing Google.com /code/pre  The result for 2.5 GHz WiFi was:      20 packets transmitted, 19 packets received, 5.0% packet loss   round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 16.295/18.872/30.858/2.935 ms   with transmit rate of 130.  And for my 5 GHz WiFi:  15 packets transmitted, 15 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 17.451/19.066/21.444/1.157 ms  with transmit rate of 216.  <comment177589> Not really, but what are your numbers? <comment177590> 30ms, having some issues when gaming.  I have a high bandwidth at 50mb but wondering if it's an issue of my MacBook Pro not having a dedicated Ethernet port.  I saw the post I mentioned in the question and hoped maybe it was a solution. <comment177593> Did you Ping your router or a web site? What is your ping for Google.com <comment177594> I have only used speedtest and pingtest and provided those results.  I am not sure how to ping check for something like Google.com.  Not sure if it's worth mentioning but am also using a apple time capsule router. <comment178684> @Buscarì›ƒ I checked ping time with google server and --- www.google.com ping statistics --- 10 packets transmitted, 10 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 15.066/17.942/22.067/2.154 ms
