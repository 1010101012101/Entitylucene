Pressing a wrong key sheds blue light on whole screen in iTerm <body> Pressing a key that doesn't do anything, sheds a blue light on the screen for a moment, and it's quite annoying.  For example, in iTerm, since pressing kbdDown Arrow Key/kbd doesn't do anything, so it sheds blue light on the screen to let me know there is something with what I'm doing, but it's pretty annoying.  I use Vim for development, and time and again, I press kbdEsc/kbd to switch between different modes, and this thing annoys a lot. Is there a way to get rid of it?    <answer250389> Still have no idea what's wrong with it, but searching on Google gave me the following command to execute, and it did the job:  precodesudo killall coreaudiod /code/pre  <comment310880> Have a look at System Prefs  Accessibility  Audio. Do you have Flash Screen activated? [You can test to see if it looks the same with the test button on there] <comment310881> No, it's deactivated form here, but it's pretty much the same thing. <comment310882> I'm not sure it it's still an option anywhere, but the Mac used to flash the screen if the system volume was turned to zero/muted. <comment310884> Google sold you as popular as stupid a piece of advice. <comment310885> @danielAzuelos Kindly explain if I had something wrong. <comment311083> Does the same flashing happen with `Terminal`? <comment311084> Is it OK after a restart of OSX? <comment311095> @danielAzuelos Yes. Everywhere, including Teminal app. <comment325671> Restarted my mac after that, and it is working OK. No issues.
