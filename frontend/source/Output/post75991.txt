How can I create a new iPad backup in iTunes after I forgot the backup password? <body> I lost my password for the backup of my iPad. I don't need to restore, just be able to make a new backup with a new password, preferrably without reinstalling iTunes.  <answer76406> You don't need to reinstall iTunes (and in fact, that won't help you since the backups are stored as data and not part of the application). You can go into iTunes preferences and Delete the old backup under devices.
