OS X Active Directory Domain Trust Lost <body> Is there a known issue with Macs loosing domain trust?  I've been Googling with little success. It seems to mainly be an issue of time drift, and setting the ntp server to the domain time server fixes the issue.  Active Directory 2008 domain level. Windows 2008 R2, 2012 , and 2012 R2 domain controllers. 2015 Macbook MacOS Sierra  We have 15 to 20 Macs in our AD domain of 1300 machines. From all reports it is only this one machine that has lost domain trust (more than once). The tech supporting this Mac user took it upon himself to unbind ALL Macs from the domain. Is this the only solution? Are there 3rd party utilities that fix this issue?  Thanks LT.Son  <comment324614> Tho I have no experience with the issue I have heard that Apple's built-in AD support is not the best. There are third party tools that will bind a Mac to AD, which I have heard generally good things about, tho not recently. If no one here has any suggestions afp548.com is a site for Mac IT Admins that may have what you are looking for.
