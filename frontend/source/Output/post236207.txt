Added SSH User, No Home Directory <body> So, on a Yosemite system, I enabled Remote Login (ssh) and added a specific user. When I ssh as this user, my home directory defaults to /var/empty. Was I supposed to do anything else to enable a correct Home directory? (Note that the system has an Active Directory network account server.)  <answer236209> So not sure how you created the user but if you are expecting a locally cached home directory, and this is not a network account, you will want to user commands like the following to create the user account:  Credit for Script: http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Mac_OSX_adduser_script  precodedscl . -create /Users/$USERNAME dscl . -create /Users/$USERNAME UserShell /bin/bash dscl . -create /Users/$USERNAME RealName "$FULLNAME" dscl . -create /Users/$USERNAME UniqueID "$USERID" dscl . -create /Users/$USERNAME PrimaryGroupID 20 dscl . -create /Users/$USERNAME NFSHomeDirectory /Users/$USERNAME dscl . -passwd /Users/$USERNAME $PASSWORD /code/pre  If you are looking to have the user directory provided by ActiveDirectory then ensure you have the following checked in your Active directory config and that all your server side AD settings are correct for this:  'User UNC Path from Active Directory to derive network home location'   <comment289027> How / where did you add the user? <comment289029> Via System Preferences  Sharing. When clicking on Remote Login, I added the user via the + button, then selected the user out of the list when clicking on "Network Users".
