Mac OS "Go to desktop #" keyboard shortcourt <body> I am looking for a shortcut to change desktop in Mac OS X (10.7.3)  I am used to awesome WM in which you can do + to go to desktop #  I am looking for a keyboard shortcut in MacOS X to do this. I tried to make one using jiTouch but I didn't succeed.  Note: I am not asking to show/display the current desktop, only moving between them directly by their ID.  I have 5 desktop and going from #1 to #5 can take some time especially with the sliding effects. this is a productivity killer.  Thanks for any help.  <answer45168> As defined in System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts, you can use ^N, where N is the number of the desktop, to move between desktops.  <comment51405> Thanks, I didn't saw this in the configuration.
