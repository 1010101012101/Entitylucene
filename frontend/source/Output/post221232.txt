El Capitan Photos Sync Problem <body> I have sync issues with Photos app on Mac. I am not sure when it started or what caused to it but for a long time (approximately more than 2 months) Photos app doesn't download new images from iCloud.  My IPhone and IPad can sync photos without any problem but mac could not achieve.  I tried to pause and continue syncing via Preferences window several times but it didn't made any impact. One time i uncheck iCloud Photo Archieve on iCloud settings and that made everything worse. After checking that option again, it decided to upload every photo again to iCloud and it still couldn't finish.  Currently there is 2832 photos waiting to upload for a week but i don't know what it is doing. Is there any log file about upload process?  Do you have any suggestion about fixing this problem?  Ps: I am using a shared internet behind mikrotik and not sure any port or limitation cause this.
