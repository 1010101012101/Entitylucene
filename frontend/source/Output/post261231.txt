Facebook messenger not showing I'm on messenger <body> For a great while (about half a year) now, my friends have said to me that there is a 'Invite to Messenger' box in my chat. All my friends see this as I have asked around and they claimed it was true.  ul liOf course I am using the Messenger app. It's the only thing I use./li liI have already reinstalled the Messenger app multiple times./li liIt did not appear with my previous Android devices, only on the new iPhone 6s+./li liI also have the grey 'f' icon instead of the blue icon I should have./li liI tried logging out of all sessions and logging in only on the Messenger app./li /ul  This is very annoying for my friends. What can I do to get rid of it?  <comment327131> Two things: questions about smartphone apps are off-topic here. This site is only for questions about the web app. Second, it seems like it's marketing to your friends, not to you. I don't know that there's anything you can do about it. When you re-post this on the appropriate site ([apple.se] or [android.se]) it would be very useful to include a screen shot to illustrate exactly what you're talking about. <comment327133> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is about mobile app.
