Changing background colour of a text in window title bar using zsh command <body> The answer to the question in this link (related to how to use LaTeXmk which is a tool of automatically compiling .tex files) shows how to change a text in window title bar of Terminal using a codezsh/code command. For example, the following line in code.latexmkrc/code adds a text strongFAILURE/strong to the title bar.  code$failure_cmd = 'zsh -c "print -n \"\e]0;%D FAILURE\a\""';/code  Is it possible to change the background color (e.g. red) of the text "FAILURE" by changing the codezsh/code command above? If not, are there alternative ways to achieve the same goal (adding a text and changing its backgroud colour in window title bar of Terminal)?  Your help would be greately appreciated.
