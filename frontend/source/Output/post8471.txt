Is there an xkeymacs equivalent in Mac? <body> In PC, the utility of xkeymacs.exe enables one to use emacs key in every case. Does Mac have the similar utility? For example, is there a utility that I can use key 'C-x C-s' to send the key 'Command-S'?  <answer8481> strongEdit/strong: It looks like there is a solution described here.  hr  I don't strongknow/strong of a solution, but I'd bet if anything could do this, it would be Ukelele.     Ukelele can assign multiple-character   strings and can create "dead keys",   where a keystroke sets a new state   that modifies the output of the   following keystroke.   Possibly combined with an Automator app. The initial keystroke kbdC-x/kbd initiates the app, it captures the secondary keystroke (kbdC-s/kbd), uses a lookup table to convert kbdC-s/kbd to kbdCMD/kbd+kbds/kbd, and then passes that to the foreground app.  <answer8575> I don't know xkeymap, but it sounds like you want to do keyboard mapping. Mac OS is built on BSD, hence codexmodmap/code should work...  <answer9097> You could configure some of them in code~/Library/Keybindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code. See hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/cocoa-text.html and this sample file: Emacs Opt Bindings.dict.  Another option would be to use KeyRemap4MacBook. It supports over 1000 preconfigured keybindings, including an "Emacs Mode" section.  <comment9090> You do know that many emacs keybindings just work in OS X apps, right? C-a and C-e, for example, move to front and end of a text line in TextEdit, the Safari URL bar, etc. <comment9091> @mankoff : Yes, I do. However, I just wanted to know if I can have 'C-x C-s' also.
