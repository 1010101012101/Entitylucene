I can receive emails, but it does not send when doing a test send on setting up the email. Error code: 0x800cce05  SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com My outgoing server requires authentication (ticked) Port: 465 (SSL). Also tried 587, SSL, TLS  It works fine on my mobile, works fine with Office 2010. Works fine with Windows 10 mail. But not with Office Outlook 2016.  <answer210550> it might be that you have to allow less secure apps to connect to your gmail account: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps  more details:https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/gmail/LhWVrYZc_Eo/5EMpldFUC3wJ  <comment267967> I have the same problem, was on a long online help chat with Microsoft today, I let them to control my computer online, they tried everything, after two hours he gave up.
