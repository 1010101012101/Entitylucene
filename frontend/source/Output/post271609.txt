macOS Sierra - iMessage corrects me despite spellcheck is turned off <body> Good day! iMessage on my mac fixes my typos as I type despite the fact that I've disabled spell check in settings.  Here is how it looks:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ad3D.png" alt="iMessage"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Deel.png" alt="Preferences"  Is there any way to fix that? Thank you in advance.  <answer271611> In Messages, go to Edit  Spelling and Grammar and make sure the items for automatic correction are UNchecked.  <answer271664> also completely quit the Messages app after changing the settings, then restart it.  <comment341441> That's not actually fixing anything, just telling you it doesn't recognise the word. If it had fixed it, the word would be a) spelled correctly & b) underlined in blue dots, not red. <comment341458> Yes, you are right, but how do I show you fixing as I type unless I do some sort of a screencap? See answer to my question below. <comment341459> Thanks a lot, that did the trick! <comment341585> Please see the accepted answer. I have disabled spell-check long before I've run the iMessage for the first time.
