automatically convert low-quality tracks when added to iTunes library <body> When I add new tracks to iTunes, some of them are too low-quality to add to iCloud.  I have to manually convert them to AAC.  How can I have iTunes automatically do this so all of my tracks can go straight to the cloud?  <answer277158> If you are using Windows, you should be able to go through these steps:  ol liChoose Edit  Preferences, click General, and click Import Settings./li liChoose AAC format from the Import Using pop-up menu./li /ol  In that same window, you can also choose other import settings that may be of interest to you.  <comment348854> That won't *automatically* convert newly added tracks. Thanks tho. <comment348855> It will automatically when you do an import.  Perhaps I misunderstood your question.  What do you mean by "automatically"? <comment348857> so this will automatically convert tracks that are ripped from a CD.  most newer computers don't use those anymore.  when i download a file using safari it's automatically played in iTunes.  i can manually convert the file to AAC using the settings i specified in Import Settings.  However, I'd like it to automatically convert that file when it is added to my library.  thanks!
