macOS Sierra keeps trying to connect to an old server and a current server and is failing <body> Two servers - one of them is no longer there, the other is.  Sierra is constantly trying to connect to both of these servers. The one that is there can be connected by IP address but by name it fails and keeps trying even though the username and password are identical to those used to connect via IP.  The older server is no longer on the system and I get repeated attempts to connect to the IP address and the name and of course this will fail.  I have cleared all favourites from Finder go connect to server and cleared all hard drive connections from login items  I even changed the IP on the server away from 6 and also back to 6  I checked all the passwords on the server and changed them away and back again.  The connection failed window pops up every few seconds so prevents me doing any work unless I leave it sitting on top of other windows.  There must be something else trying to connect but I can't find it - I have also quit every app running except Finder which I have relaunched  I have rebooted several times.  I lost an external disk yesterday and this is all since then - this was a usb disk on my Mac not a disk on the server in question.  I run Server.app but this has no connections to either the old or new server.  Any ideas welcome.  I have managed to remove remote disk and had already removed all favourites in finder - go - connect to server - as said in the original question. Nothing in "Connect to server", nothing in preferences - user - login items, no remote disk.  I can't think of anywhere else this could be coming from every app quit except this browser window and finder. Relaunched Finder, restarted system...  What else could it be?  <comment330516> Have you already checked auto_mount? Custom launch daemons? Is your host integrated in an OD or AD? Which kind of protocol does the (failing) connection use: SMB/AFP/NFS?
