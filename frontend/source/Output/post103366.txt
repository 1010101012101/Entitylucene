How do I figure out what is keeping my Mac Pro from sleeping? <body> For some odd reason, my Mac Pro won't sleep by itself. Unlike, this question, it does stay asleep; it just won't go to sleep by itself. I read Why your Mac might not sleep or stay in sleep mode, but to no avail.  I tried codepmset -g assertions/code and got this:  precode9/26/13 9:11:36 AM PDT    Assertion status system-wide:    PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0    PreventSystemSleep             0    PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0    ExternalMedia                  0    UserIsActive                   0    ApplePushServiceTask           0    BackgroundTask                 0 /code/pre  And then a whole bunch of kernel assertions that had nothing set. What is going on?  <comment121677> I was on the wrong track and based on your negative vote I deleted my answer. <comment121678> That's fine :) No problem. I appreciate the help. <comment121685> Have you checked out the likely causes and solutions from this section (on an Apple KB) - "[How can I determine what is causing a sleep issue and how can I resolve it?](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1776)"? <comment121686> Also see this answer on superuser for [What is preventing my MacBook from sleeping?](http://superuser.com/a/409481) <comment121698> @MK Sorry, I forgot to add that. Yes I did. <comment121700> I tried that answer. Nothing was listed. I did have iTunes playing and that did list it under `pmset -g`, but as soon as I paused it, there was nothing preventing sleep.
