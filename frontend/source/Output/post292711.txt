Macbook pro 15" 2015 mid not turning on but fans are running <body> My MacBook Pro 15" is not turning on but fans are running and it repeatedly starts and stops, no physical damage and also sometimes it starts but now it is totally frozen after shutdown (usually I kept the mac on sleep mode), warranty ended 1 month ago.  I have reset SMC, PRAM, and removed the battery plug - the problem still persists after these.
