Disable window switching shortcut to type French accent grave <body> The shortcut Option ⌥ + ` (back tick on the tilde key above tab) followed by the letter a, e or u would allow you to type a French accent grave (i.e. "où").   However now in El Capitan, that same shortcut switches between windows of the active application. I have the default US English keyboard on an English Macbook.  I've looked at this Keyboard setting but it's not conflicting: System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Keyboard - "Move focus to next window" is set to ⌘ + `  I've checked all other entries in "Shortcuts", and none are set to ⌥ + `.  <comment315696> Double-check that you don't have the modifier keys changed (System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard  Modifier Keys...) as that would cause that. Any other utilities installed that change or remap keys, like Karabiner or BetterTouchTool? <comment315728> ` is a back-tick, btw, not an apostrophe ' <comment315888> @tubedogg I have Alfred, but I checked the settings and didn't see anything tetsujin Thanks, corrected! <comment324149> @tubedogg Modifier keys are set to default. I've closed Alfred. The shortcut is triggering the Application Window switcher, which isn't an option on the Keyboard Shortcuts menu. I've upgrade to Mac Sierra and have the same issue. Under "Mission Control" there's an Application Windows setting, but that's a different feature. I've tried disabling that anyways. I'm stuck! <comment356109> Happy to report that the problem has fixed itself, but I don't know how (Sierra update possibly).
