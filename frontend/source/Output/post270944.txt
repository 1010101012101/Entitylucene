How to sort videos exported from Photos.app on date? <body> When I export videos from the videos album in the Photos.app I expect it to be able to sort the videos on date in Finder as I can do in the Videos-album.  My current workflow:  ol liI find the date of the video with right-click "Get Info" menu in the Photos.app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mFWYq.png" alt="Get Info in Photos.app"/li liI choose "File" - "Export unmodified original for 1 video..." - "Export", then choose a local folder to store it./li liWhen I right-click - "Get Info" menu in Finder I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J88Lb.png" alt="Get Info in Finder"/li /ol  The date in the Photos.app is right, the one in Finder is wrong. The result is that it is not possible to sort video-files exported on the date it was created.  So, how is it possible to export a video from the Photos.app, keep the correct date, so that it is possible to sort it on the date it was created?
