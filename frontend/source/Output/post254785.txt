Installing pgadminIII v1.22.1 on macOS Sierra 10.12 <body> I just got a new MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) with 10.12 installed and am installing various applications on the machine to get it ready for work.  After downloading the codepgadmin3-1.22.1.dmg/code from https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/pgadmin3/release/v1.22.1/osx/, I am unable to open the program.  strongSo far, I have tried the following:/strong  ul liI found a description of the Gatekeeper updates made to version 10.12 at https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/15/macos-sierra-gatekeeper-changes/ and then attempted to right-click and select 'open' in order to get pgadminIII to open.  This unfortunately didn't work.  A popup is displayed with the following:  precode"pgadmin3" can't be opnened because it is from an unidentified developer." /code/pre/li liUsing the codeopen/code command from terminal.  Same problem -- popup displays the following:  precode"pgadmin3" can't be opnened because it is from an unidentified developer." /code/pre/li liUsing codesudo open/code from terminal.  Error is returned within the terminal and is a bit more verbose:  precodeLSOpenURLsWithROle() failed with error -10810 for the file /Volumes/pgAdmin3/pgAdmin3.app /code/pre/li /ul  Google and SE have been fruitless so far.  Grateful for any ideas...

The solution, which is to change the file attributes (specifically the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute) ended up solving the problem permanently and can be used to avoid having to always "right-click and open."
