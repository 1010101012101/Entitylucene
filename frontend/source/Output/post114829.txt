Back up all necessary iMovie files with Carbonite <body> I have Carbonite set up on my wife's MacBook Pro in order to back up all her files to the cloud. She's not always diligent about making sure she leaves it on long enough to back up everything, so I was checking its status today after a big video import and noticed that it looks like the .mov files in the ~/Movies/iMovie Events.localized folder are not backed up.  So all the project files are backed up but not the video clips themselves! Doesn't this kind of defeat the purpose?  Does anyone know any way to make sure these are backed up automatically without having to manually select all these files for backup all the time? Or do I need to look into a different backup service?  <comment167532> Did you have any luck with the answer? I have used Carbonite as my backup server, had my laptop stolen, trying to recreate my iMovie files and cannot find these original clips!! <comment167701> Not yet. Wife's computer so haven't really been back to it since. Considering other backup strategies though. :-(
