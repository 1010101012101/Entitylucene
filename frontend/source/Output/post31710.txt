iPod Nano 2G Screen Randomly Turns Itself On While Locked <body> I have a 5 year old, excellent condition, iPod Nano 2G 8GB.  While sitting on my desk with the Lock switch Locked, it will randomly turn the screen on for 5-10 seconds, randomly every couple hours.  It has been 2 days since I charged the battery and it's still at 80%, so this doesn't seem to be causing a large battery drain.  But why is the screen turning itself on?  Nothing is touching the click wheel.  And even if I pick it up, the screen won't turn on since I have the Lock switch engaged.  What could possibly be triggering this random screen illumination?
