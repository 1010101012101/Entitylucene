Aliases in Alfred: Keyword -> Open a specific folder in finder <body> I would like to define aliases (keywords) in Alfred so that by typing codekeyboard/code followed by kbdRET/kbd, it opens a pre-specified folder in Finder.  strongFor example/strong: codep1/code could be an alias for "project_1" that lives under:  precode/Users/josh/code/projects/project_1 /code/pre  so when I open Alfred and type codep1/code, Alfred opens the above path directly in Finder.  Is this possible with Alfred? How?  <answer121960> Yes, you can. There are many ways to achieve the result you want. The easiest method is to create a workflow that contains all the aliases (keywords) that open folders/files in Finder. You must use Alfred 2 for this to work.  ul liOpen Alfred Preferences and choose Workflows tab./li liCreate a new workflow by choosing the plus sign in sidebar. You can name the  workflow as Custom Paths/Searces./li liSelect the active workflow and select the plus sign at top right. Choose codeInputs &gt; Keywords/code as your trigger. Fill in the keyword you want to use for as aliases. You’ll see one node is created in the workflow main panel./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T7LqD.jpg" alt="Enter keyword"  ul liCreate a new node from codeActions &gt; Launch Apps / Files/code. Drag the folders you wish to launch from Finder into the list./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sTgSz.jpg" alt="Drag folder into list"  You can create set of folders if you wish. But by far this is the one I prefer because it offers more flexibility than using scripts like codeOpen ~/Desktop/code via Terminal.  <answer128641> While it doesn't create a custom Alfred alias/keyword for each item, I've been using the strongRecent Items/strong workflow for this. It includes an emAdd to Favorites/em Finder Action that will add any Finder item (apps, files, folders) to its Favorites section for quick access later.   Here's the relevant section from the workflow's thread (link above):     Keyword fav: will list your Favorite items. To Add an item to   Favorites use Alfred File Action or while browsing any Recent Items   category hold fn key and press Return; to remove an item from   Favorites, go to Favorites, select the item, hold control key and   press Return   h3Adding Favorites: Finder Actions in Alfred/h3  In case you aren't familiar with Alfred's Finder Actions, read about them here. You'll need to purchase PowerPack. The Recent Items workflow will install a new Finder Action called emAdd to Favorites/em. In Alfred, press the right arrow key → when any app, folder or file is selected and you'll see the Finder Actions available. Look for the heart icon near the bottom of the list; actioning emthat/em will add the current selection to your Favorites. (Click the up arrow ↑ to get to the bottom of the list faster.)  h3Saving URLs to Favorites/h3  Since the workflow is limited to Finder items you'll need to save any web links you want to add to Favorites somewhere in Finder...and keep them there. (Even after adding the Favorite to the Recent Items workflow. If you move or delete the .webloc file it will disappear from Favorites).   Tips on .webloc:   ul liDrag the icon to the left of the URL in the browser address bar to a Finder window to create the .webloc file. /li liRename the .webloc file whatever you'd like (its the page title by default). The filename is what's displayed in Favorites, not the URL./li /ul  h3Accessing Your Favorites/h3  Now that you've got some Favorites saved there are a couple of ways to quickly access them:  emOut of the box/em  ol liActivate Alfred /li liType 'rec fa' (for some reason 'f' alone brings up Folders instead of Favorites)/li liPress tab ⇥ /li liArrow to your desired Favorite (or type some more to filter the list) and hit return ↩ to launch!/li /ol  emAssign a Global Hotkey/em (To eliminate steps 1-3 above!)  ol liOpen Alfred's Preferences (activate Alfred and click the cog or type "Alfred")/li liHead to the Workflows tab/li liFind the Recent Items 3.0 workflow and select it/li liThe second box down from the upper-right should be a Hotkey step called "rec Favorites " - double-click this box/li liType the hotkey combination you want (mine is ⌃⌥⌘F)/li /ol  Hit your hotkey anywhere (Alfred doesn't need to be activated) and your Favorites will be instantly displayed!   <comment142297> Thanks. This is very helpful, although it's tedious to define them one by one using the GUI. It would be great if there was an easier way of entering them, e.g. directly with a text editor. Do you know if this is possible at all? <comment142377> I don’t have experience building the workflow without using GUI. You can try to ask around at Alfred Forums, someone might guide you to build similar workflows, but with plain text to store paths.
