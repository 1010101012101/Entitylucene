Do lots of fonts affect the (overall) performance of my system? <body> I got lots of fonts eminstalled/em and emactive/em. Sometimes I feel like a large amount of fonts is slowing down my applications, especially when they offer font choices (e.g. Photoshop, Pages, …). The drop down is appearing with delay or a beachball of death is popping up for some seconds.  But that's just about specific applications… What about OS X in general? How much do many active/installed fonts slow down the system?
