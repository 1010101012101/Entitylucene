install Linux on iMac G5 <body> Is there a Linux distribution, that runs on an old iMac G5 with a PowerPC processor? I would like to use the old iMac as computer for my mother, she would only need an up-to-date browser running, nothing more.  I found MintPPC, based on the Debian "testing" branch. Would that work?  hr  I am installing mintPPC right now with this installation instruction. It seems to work fine.  <answer98144> Debian is probably your best choice. The problem is that the Flash Player situation would be worse on Linux than on Mac OS X. There is no official Flash Player for Linux PPC. There are some alternatives, though, described in this article. This page has an strongextremely/strong detailed guide on installing Debian for PowerPC. Also, this page describes which macs are compatible with Debian PPC. Oh, and yes, MintPPC would work.   <answer116995> I have a Mac G5 as well. I have run Lubuntu on it for some time. It is a light weight version of Ubuntu.   <answer280770> I would use Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (Precise Pangolin). It works well for old iMacs, if you use the right PowerPC installer.
