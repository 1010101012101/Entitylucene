OSX 10.9 insist on connecting with WIFI despite also having an ethernet connection <body> OS X 10.9.4 (13E28)  Having 2 type of connections available USB/ethernet and WIFI I want to connect both of them because I want to connect to different devices (which don't support that kind of luxury) and because the WIFI internet connection is flaky.  Unfortunately it seem that OSX insist on connecting to internet via WIFI even if I turn it off, and totally ignore the USB/ethernet connection.  The adapter works with a different device, on OSX it report that is correctly get a DHCP address. Any interruption of the WIFI connection report all my internet host as being down/unreachable and ignore the other existing connection.  <comment170218> You actually turn off the wifi and it still connects? <comment170219> it doesn't connect, although the ethernet connection is reported being up, so any networking activity report the computer being offline <comment170220> By the way I also tried changing connection priorities, but that does not change anything
