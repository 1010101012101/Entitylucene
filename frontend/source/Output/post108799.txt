Do I really need to configure each subfolder in my Exchange inbox for push on an iPhone? <body> I have an iPhone 5 running iOS 7. I have an Exchange inbox with at least a dozen subfolders and server-side rules that "pre-sort" mail to these subfolders. If I want to receive push notifications for these subfolders (and I do), I have to configure this for every single subfolder. When I add new folders in Outlook, I need to remember to add it on my phone.  Is there a way to tell the iOS mail client to push emall/em subfolders of a given inbox automatically?  <answer108806> The answer appears to be no, and it is a longstanding issue. http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1868 https://discussions.apple.com/message/23132172#23132172 https://discussions.apple.com/message/8516130#8516130  <answer222745> If you are using the native mail app yes you can do this in IOS. In Settings  mail,contacts, calendars  fetch new data  Exchange is a list of all folders and only inbox will be checked for pushed folders. Select the folders you want auto pushed and you should be all set.   <comment269951> Read the question again.
