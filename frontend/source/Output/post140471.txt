Bootcamp "No Bootable device" but windows already installed <body> I had an issue in OSX which meant that I had to erase the OSX partition, and after reinstalling OSX, my bootcamp partition won't load. It's not in the option menu on start up, but is still recognised in codestart up disk/code and codedisk utility/code. I selected it in codestartup disk/code but I got there error mentioned in the title. I can see all my files in finder, but just can't boot into windows. Anyone know what's going on?  Thanks,br Mike  <answer141228> Turns out the partition MBR was wiped on the erase and the entire disk became a single GPT with a single hybrid MBR. I had for recreate the Hybrid MBR using FDISK.
