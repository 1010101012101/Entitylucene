Software update never completes <body> I have an eMac (PPC G4) with 512 MB RAM, running 10.5.8. When I run Software Update, the "Checking for new software..." process never completes. I have tried deleting my code/Library/Caches/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate/Cache.db/code and running Software Update again, with no luck. I have also tried Repairing Disk Permissions from Disk Utility, and that hasn't worked either. Both of those suggestions I got from here  Any suggestions??  <answer3244> Do it the CLI way:  precodesudo softwareupdate -i -a /code/pre  this may help to get more verbose output.  <answer3462> Try moving the contents of /Library/Receipts somewhere else. I have seen some weird problems caused by corrupted files there a couple of times. Also make sure apps like Little Snitch do not intervene in the process.  <comment1248> Have you tried running it from the command line? `softwareupdate --list` to see if it spits out any errors? <comment1270> Yep I tried that too. Just freezes just like the GUI <comment1272> Also an output from your Console would be helpful to see where the problem might be. <comment1359> There is no console output. It just freezes and does not complete lol <comment1363> Can you access http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/index.sucatalog from your browser or using curl? (Just to rule out that you can talk to Apple's servers) and if have you tried deleting com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist in `/Library/Preferences/`? <comment2869> Have you tried creating a new user account and executing the Software Update from that new user? <comment2955> Thanks for the reply. This freezes as well, right after the command is issued. <comment2959> Thanks Mart√≠n, I tried that but it didn't work yet. Still trying. <comment3064> right after? nothing like `Software Update Tool Copyright 2002-2009 Apple` ?? alternatively, if you `man softwareupdate` you'll get a list of options, like a simple `sudo softwareupdate -l` listing and even more useful `sudo softwareupdate -v -i -a` to have a verbose output <comment3225> well, yeah I get the 'Software Update Tool' info, but it freezes after that. I believe I tried the `man softwareupdate` but I don't remember what happened lol. I definitely didn't try with verbose output. I'll try that later. Thanks!
