Wifi problem in OSX 10.7.1 after wake from sleep <body> Basically it takes very long (sometimes up to 5 minutes) to reconnect to wifi after waking my Macbook Air (june '11 model) running OSX 10.7.1 It does show a list of available networks when I click the wifi icon and it does include the network I want to connect to, but it doesn't do anything if I click the network name.  <answer24419> Seems these issues will be fixed in 10.7.2â€”maybe you'll just have to wait a few more days until things will get back to normal.  <comment26246> Experiencing the same thing. Seems to be new with 10.7.1, because I don't recall this occurring before updating from 10.7.0. <comment27240> Loads of people seeing this: http://twitter.com/#!/dhh/status/111136661206876160
