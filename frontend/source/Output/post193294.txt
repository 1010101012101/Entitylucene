iOS iPhone Safari freezes and is unresponsive <body> Safari on my iPhone is completely unusable. It opens fine but when I try to visit an address it freezes. The loading bar sticks at maybe 10%.  This happens with any address I type or any search query I make. I have to quit the app to be able to try again.   Actions taken: * Clear safari browsing data * Reset iPhone settings * Erase settings and content and restore from iCloud backup  I guess the next step would be to erase settings and content and not restore. I'm reluctant to do this as I don't want to lose everything.   Is there any other step I can try to get Safari working?  I'm using iOS 8.3. (I've read that this was a bug with 8.2, so I'm surprised I'm experiencing this issue and it's not been completely fixed)  <comment230301> The long way would be test both - erase without restore, test, erase & restore, test. At least then you'd have a better clue where the root cause may lie. <comment230303> Thanks, I did that, and Safari is working fine in the non-restored version. So it's something somewhere in my saved settings. <comment230304> just a guess - do you have any non-Apple keyboard replacement? <comment230306> No, used to but deleted it a while ago. <comment230308> hmm… sorry, I'm running out of ideas - wish you luck….see if anybody else has something. <comment244516> I’m experiencing the exact same issue on 8.4.1. Though it doesn’t happen with all websites. It does seem that sites with a slower response time are more inclined to freeze Safari.
