How to remove wireless network utility icon from the menu bar? <body> I installed the driver of TP-Link's wireless network adaptor, and it ships with a wireless network utility which shows an icon on the menubar.  It is invalid to click or drag this icon, and I even can't find any switches to turn it off.  It looks like this:  img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d0u9/test_repository/master/pics/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-02%20at%207.25.57%20PM.png" alt=""  <answer217969> The menubar icon is related to the app emStatusBarApp.app/em (path: /System/Library/CoreServices/StatusBarApp.app). The app is loaded by launchd while booting. The related plist should be located at /Library/LaunchAgents/ and the file name is emWlan.Software.plist/em.  To unload the launch agent enter  precodesudo launchctl unload Wlan.Software /code/pre  To permanently remove the launch agent enter  precodesudo launchctl remove Wlan.Software /code/pre  Alternatively you can remove the file /Library/LaunchAgents/Wlan.Software.plist.  After a reboot the icon should be gone.  I have tested this with the installer emTL-WN725N_V2_150901/em. Since you didn't specify any adapter (or driver) in your question the name of your app/plist may differ. Please check this with codelaunchctl list/code or codelaunchctl list | grep Wlan/code.  <answer235242> use cleanmymac 3 for remove te menubar icon  <comment263448> Have you tried holding the Command key and removing it (drag it off)? <comment263450> I tried but failed... <comment263451> You say "it's invalid to click". So, it's an icon that does nothing? If you click it nothing appears? <comment263452> Yes, it just sticks on the menu bar and provides nothing, no popup menu no blinking... <comment263454> My network adaptor is *TL-WN822N Ver 3.0*. `Wlan.Software.plist` can be found at `/Library/LaunchAgents`, but the output of `sudo launchctl unload Wlan.Software.plist` is `/Library/LaunchAgents/Wlan.Software.plist: Could not find specified service`. <comment263455> I removed `Wlan.Software.plist` and rebooted my computer, the icon has gone... <comment263456> @user3824053 Sorry, copy and paste error ;-). Just remove the .plist part in the `sudo lauchctl ...`command. I have updated the answer. <comment263457> It does work, thx for your help. :) <comment287755> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.
