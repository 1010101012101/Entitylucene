Two persons simultaneously using one MacBook Pro (working in two apps simultaneous ) <body> Is it possible for such a setup as the following: Hooking one MacBook Pro up with two separate monitors, allowing two different persons to work independently on their monitors, sharing the computer's performance?  Perhaps this is a strange request, but it would actually be useful for me in certain situations. (I will be working in one monitor and in the another one my daughter will be playing.) I ask cause i do not know how focus will work in this situation.   <answer293614> Two people using the same graphical user session, with different input devices, is not possible on macOS.  h2Remote Session - VNC/h2  However, you can remote log into a Mac and share the computer's performance. Remote log in will give you two graphical user sessions running on one Mac.  You could use an inexpensive computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, and have it remotely connect to your MacBook Pro. One user could then use the Mac directly and the other via the remote connection and a monitor.
