Get Spotlight to search in Caskroom subdirs (which is now in /usr/local/) <body> I'm using Homebrew with Caskroom and since a recent update, it installs the apps downloaded through codebrew cask/code within code/usr/local/Caskroom//code  I always used Spotlight to find and open these apps, but now that they're within /usr/local/, Spotlight doesn't seem to find them anymore.  I've checked Spotlight's preferences but there is no folder excluded, nor is there anything else disabled that could cause this.  Is there a way to tell Spotlight to search within code/usr/local/Caskroom//code?  <answer243493> Try rebuilding the spotlight index on your mac:  ol liChoose Apple  menu  System Preferences, then click Spotlight./li liClick the Privacy tab./li liDrag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Click OK to confirm./li liSelect the folder or disk you just added, then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the list./li liQuit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk./li /ol  From Apple Support website.  <answer243826> I found the answer provided by user vitorgalvao on the project's Github page: https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/22317     Spotlight doesn’t index /usr/local/, that why we started using /opt in the first place. Reinstall your apps with --force and they’ll be moved (our new behaviour). Spotlight will see them then.   <comment299868> Thanks, but no, unfortunately that didn't help. I added the Caskroom folder, closed settings, went back and removed it, and closed again. But even several hours later, Spotlight still doesn't find anything in that Caskroom folder. I also checked if non-accessibility could be causing this, but the user rights on Caskroom and its subdirs are readable for user, group, and others.
