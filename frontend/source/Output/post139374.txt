email deleted on email client is still in the inbox on my iphone <body> when I delete email on my email client, these email remain on my iphone. How do I get the iphone to have the same email as the server?  <answer162213> POP mail servers do not synchronise their data between devices in the way IMAP does.   Each device will download any mail in the queue when asked &amp; will not auto-delete anything, except for any set server timeout interval, which is adjustable from Mail on the Mac or from iDevice - Settings  Mail, Contacts…  [the email account] Advanced  Delete from Server…  Other than that, deletion once downloaded is manual, per device.  <comment164368> Are you accessing your mailbox via IMAP or POP? <comment164409> Well, I have 2 email accounts, a gmail account that seems to be imap, and a verizon account that seems to be POP. <comment164423> And which account shows the problem (or are both impacted)? <comment164554> I just tested this and it seems its the POP account that is retaining mail on the iPhone after deleting via my PC. <comment164559> I tried this again on the gmail account and it didn't update on the iPhone (the first time I tried it, the update happened soon after I deleted the mail).
