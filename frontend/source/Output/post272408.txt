Mount Server Based on Location <body> On my Mac in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups I have these two Synology NAS network drives set to mount during login:  ul liRyan (afp://NAS/Ryan)/li liShared (afp://NAS/Shared)/li /ul  This works perfectly at home but when I get to work and turn on my Mac I get this error:     There was a problem connecting to the server "NAS".      The server may not exist or it is unavailable at this time. Check the   server name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try   again.   I click OK but this popup appears around five more times before it finally goes away.   Is there a way to avoid this error? For example, only mount these drives if I'm on my home wifi network or using geolocation?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9LBK.png" alt="Users &amp; Groups"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QVM8f.png" alt="enter image description here"
