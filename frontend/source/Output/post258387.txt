Can't export 1080p to youtube <body> In my videos I am recording 1080p on my camera and combining this with video from the iphone, however I don't have the option to use 1080 when uploading to youtube.  How can I fix this?  <comment323008> Have you verified all the clips you're using are 1080p?  If you have a 720p clip in there, FCP might automatically put the settings to whatever is the lowest resolution clip. <comment323029> Check your project settings - make sure your project is in 1080p. Also try exporting as a file in 1080p (instead of the export to YouTube option)
