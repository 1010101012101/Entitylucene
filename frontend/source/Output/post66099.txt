Does the recovery partition get updates? <body> I clean-installed Mountain Lion 10.8.0. Now I am at 10.8.2 and I want to do a clean install again. If I boot to the recovery partition and do a restore, will I have 10.8.0 or 10.8.2? Does the recovery partition get updated when OS X gets updated?  <answer66105> The Recovery Partition strongdoes not/strong get updated. Once the partition is created, emOS X Recovery/em downloads the latest of your OS X version from Apple.  Extracted from Apple's strongAbout OS X Recovery/strong:     Reinstalling OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion via OS X Recovery requires broadband access to the Internet via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet connection. OS X is downloaded over the Internet from Apple when OS X Recovery is used for reinstallation.   <comment77776> cool. so its better to download it and clean install it, so i can use my mac while its downloading. thanks.
