Implementing AirPrint with DNS-SD <body> h1Background/h1  I'm trying to implement AirPrint through static DNS, like documented on http://dns-sd.org/ServerStaticSetup.html. The iPad gets the dns search domain "lan" through DHCP, and I verified that in Settings-WLAN. I think I created all necessary entries in the right places, the iPad however doesn't find my printer or if it happened to find it, it showed a lock after the printers name and didn't print. (iOS version is 6.0.1)  Has anyone here a clue, as to why iOS does not find the printer or if it finds it, why it shows it as locked?  This is my setup (simplified with example domain)  h2DNS entries/h2  h3Redirect to browse domain/h3  precodePTR b._dns-sd._udp.lan = bonjour.lan PTR lb._dns-sd._udp.lan = bonjour.lan /code/pre  h3Printer entries/h3  precodePTR _ipp._tcp.bonjour.lan = TestPrinter._ipp._tcp.bonjour.lan PTR _universal._sub._ipp._tcp.bonjour.lan = TestPrinter._ipp._tcp.bonjour.lan SRV TestPrinter._ipp._tcp.bonjour.lan = 0 0 631 mfp.printer TXT TestPrinter._ipp._tcp.bonjour.lan    txtvers=1   qtotal=1   rp=Print   ty=Toshiba MFP   adminurl=http://mfp.printer   note=Shared MFP   priority=0   product=(Toshiba eStudio 351c)   printer-state=3   printer-type=0xC0B0DE   Transparent=T   Binary=T   Fax=F   Color=T   Duplex=T   Staple=F   Copies=T   Collate=T   Punch=F   Bind=F   Sort=T   Scan=T   pdl=application/octet-stream,application/pdf,application/postscript,image/jpeg,image/png,image/urf   URF=none /code/pre  <answer244531> subCaveats: I don't own an AirPrint device nor do I have one available elsewhere for testing. So I'm not talking from my own experience in the following answer.../sub  hr  ol listrongFirst,/strong when publishing a printer (AirPrint or not) from a DNS server (em"static, Wide Area Bonjour"/em), you should include ALL of the TXT record key/value pairs which are listed in the current Bonjour Printing specification.  A tabular overview is listed in chapter 9 of the specification document (for all details please read the complete chapter):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cXcGF.png" alt="Printer Description TXT Record Keys for Bonjour/AirPrint" title="Printer Description TXT Record Keys for Bonjour/AirPrint"/li listrongSecond,/strong the Bonjour Printing emspecification requires that for a printer you always have to register the LPD protocol (code_printer._tcp/code), even if the device does not support it (codeport = 0/code) !/em.  The reason for this seemingly braindead requirement is this: LPD is considered the "flagship" protocol for service discovery related to printing. (Meaning: if you own the service instance name for code_printer/code then you also own it for code_pdl-datastream/code, code_ipp/code, code_ipps/code, etc.)  Some older versions of OS X enforced this. They would not work without it. Newer versions (and probably the next emmacOS/em version too) are less dogmatic and more pragmatic...  In your case the codeair/code (has nothing to do with AirPrint, but means s.th. like emauthentication information required/em), codeTLS/code, codeUUID/code, codeusb_MFG/code, codeusb_CMD/code and codeusb_MDL/code keys are missing (even if you'd use code""/code as their key values)./li listrongThird,/strong please take to heart the general rule about the trailing dot for domain names. Details are outlined here:   ul lidns-sd.org/TrailingDotsInDomainNames.html/li /ul/li listrongFourth,/strong maybe you also should enclose your key values in quotes. Example:  precodepdl="application/pdf,image/urf" /code/pre  not  precodepdl=application/pdf,image/urf /code/pre/li listrongFifth,/strong in general, what is quoted above in the OP code block does not look like a valid format for a emzone file/em to me. (I notice that the original question has been edited by other people than the OP, so I won't comment on the details...)/li /ol  <comment87817> This is strange, the code-fencing (4 leading spaces) isn't working... <comment87845> @JasonSalaz It's because there was a list preceding it. You have to either double indent to make the code part of the list, or get rid of the list. `code` tags would also work.
