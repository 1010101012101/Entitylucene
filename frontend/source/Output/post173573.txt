"Open Link Behind Mail" in Mail.app not working <body> When on my Mac I right click on a link in mail and select "Open Link Behind Mail" nothing happens.  I tried opening Console and seeing if there was an error message when I did it again, but I didn't notice anything new. (I looked in "SYSTEM LOG QUERIES  All Messages")  This was working a few months ago. I am using Mail 8.2 (2070.6) and OS X 10.10.2 (14C109)  <answer173584> Google tells me it's a known bug.  https://discussions.apple.com/message/27198644#27198644  Workaround is to kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd Click.  <answer179260> Yes, I'm having the same issue after upgrading to 10.10.2 (Yosemite) a couple days ago.  COMMAND-CLICK is another work-around as well.
