Does OSX support (importing) OpenVPN profiles? <body> Is there some way to import the settings of an OpenVPN client into the built-in VPN client in Mountain Lion? Or am I comparing apples to oranges?  <answer65390> h1No./h1  As of Sept 2012 (and Mountain Lion), macOS does not support OpenVPN in the built-in "Network Manager".  Out-of-the-box macOS only supports:  ul listrongL2TP over IPSec/strong/li listrongPPTP (not recommended)/strong/li listrongCisco IPSec/strong/li /ul  However, you can use the following third-party OpenVPN clients in macOS:  ul liShimo/li liViscosity/li liTunnelblick (open source, free)/li lipritunl client (open source, free)/li /ul  I can confirm that both Shimo and Viscosity support the import of code.ovpn/codeprofiles.   <comment76835> Tunnelblick does too. I've distributed `.ovpn` profiles in the past to users. <comment278441> Update: El Capitan supports [IKEv2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Key_Exchange) as well. <comment282589> @kojiro so does that mean we can use `.ovpn` to connect now? <comment282646> I do not know, but would love to hear about it. <comment328184> It does not but please assure that you request this feature at http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html -- it matters if you want the feature!!
