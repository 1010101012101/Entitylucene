Need IMAP settings to interface feed2imap with iCloud e-mail <body> I want to use feed2imap in conjunction with iCloud e-mail to provide functionality similar to Google Reader so that I can follow feeds wherever I am through either the web interface or through the mail app on my iOS 6.1.3 device.  I have a Raspberry Pi that I can set feed2imap running on.  I'm just not sure what the correct IMAP settings would be for it to drop messages into the Inbox on contemporary iCloud e-mail.  I found this from Apple but the servers do not look quite right.  What would be the proper server settings to use?  <comment117769> Have you tried those settings? What looks wrong about them to you? <comment118536> I've tried them but they don't seem to hit actual servers as they're still targeting me.com.
