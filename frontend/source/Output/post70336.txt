Why don't Exchange Calendar invites automatically delete the associated email anymore? <body> In iOS5, whenever I'd receive a meeting calendar invite from a co-worker (working in Outlook), I'd get a pop-up notification as well as an email with the calendar invite attachment.    If I accepted the meeting, the email would get automatically deleted. Since I installed iOS6, the emails don't get auto-deleted anymore.  ol liWhy?/li liIs there any workaround, either on the phone or Exchange?/li /ol
