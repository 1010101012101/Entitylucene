Water fried iPhone 4 <body> I dropped my phone into a pool a while ago, and didn't realize until about 30 minutes after. When I try to hook it up to the computer, it doesn't recognize the device, the iPhone wont turn on, it is ruined. But I was wondering if there's a way to get files off of it even with the computer not recognizing the device. Any suggestions?  <answer215486> You have no way to restore data, all gone  <comment260296> Would be nice if you had iCloud backups turned on.. <comment260316> this should be a comment <comment260317> have you backed up your iPhone through iTunes or iCloud ? <comment261573> Yes i had it on but i dont have another apple product to get them off of
