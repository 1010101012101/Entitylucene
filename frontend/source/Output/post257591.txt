How to download OS X El Capitan from the App Store even if never downloaded before macOS Sierra was released or purchased is grayed out <body> I know that in the past if I've previously downloaded OS X El Capitan from the App Store I could download it again from the Purchased tab in the App Store, however now that macOS Sierra is out I'm not able to download it as it says INSTALLED (and grayed out) even on a system running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5. Pressing any key combination, e.g kbdcontrol/kbd, kbdoption/kbd, etc. doesn't change the button to DOWNLOAD. All other previous versions of OS X can still be downloaded from my Purchased tab in App Store as they still say DOWNLOAD and are not grayed out, thus active.  The image below is from a system running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5, does not have OS X El Capitan installed on it or even the Install OS X El Capitan.app on its filesystem, yet it says it's installed and grayed out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8lcvl.png" alt="OS X App Store OS X Purchased"  <answer257592> Whether or not you've downloaded it in the past, you can now download OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (6.21 GB) via this link which will open first in the Browser, then in the App Store.     OS X El Capitan      This version of OS X El Capitan is for users running OS X Snow Leopard   who would like to upgrade to macOS Sierra. If you are running Snow   Leopard and would like to upgrade to Sierra, you need to install El   Capitan first.
