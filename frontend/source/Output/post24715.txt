Why isn't iPhone Mail working right with Google Apps Email? <body> I am having a big problem with my iPhone's Mail App. For some reason, emails are not going to my iPhone. I have all of my settings right and I have IMAP on in settings and this still keeps popping up:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTtWV.png" alt="iPhone screenshot"  I followed all of the steps on this page for Google Apps users and nothing will work, this used to work and all of a sudden it quit working. I have a lot of emails that are coming to my email account online but my iPhone mail hasn't been working for a while now. (hence the last update at the bottom in my screenshot above, em9/5/11/em)  Does anyone know what would cause this?   <answer24718> Have you tried removing the account and then adding it again? (This may help if some setting has become corrupted. doing so will force iOS to start a "fresh slate" for the account.)   <comment27742> Have you tried removing and re-adding the account? <comment27744> @Moshe Yeah, I will try again though... <comment27745> @Moshe Okay, it looks like it worked. (for now anyway, it might start up that problem again someday) Thanks :D <comment27746> Great, I'm going to post as an answer then, please accept if that worked for you.
