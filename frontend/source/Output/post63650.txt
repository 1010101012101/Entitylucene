Is there a way for Pages to display an auto-updating date in ordinal format? <body> I am currently putting together a template document in Pages and would like the date to update each time it is opened.  However, I would also like to display the date as an ordinal number (for example, today would be 11th September 2012) which isn't in the list of available formats.  Does anybody know of a way to set the date to auto-update in this format or do I have to manually set it each time?  <answer63651> You can set the date to update every time the document is opened by double-clicking on it, and selecting “Automatically update on open”. As for making the date ordinal, I don’t think it’s possible or would require heavy plist modifications or may depend on your localisation settings.  <comment73622> It surely is possible, will give you an answer in 10 minutes. <comment73638> Thank you. I had the updating part figured out but all of the formats seem kind of awkward for British English <comment73640> Is your language and region (British English and United Kingdom) set in System Preferences  Language and Text as well as the document properties? <comment73644> Yes they are. I've also just been experimenting with the system date format and haven't found any way to add an ordinal suffix there. I'm surprised, it's something I thought would've come up. <comment73649> Me too. That’s odd, but not much, observing that not a big chunk of the world uses ordinal dates. <comment188666> "Automatically update on open" does not appear as a choice when I click on the date in my document. Is there another place to find this? <comment293862> The auto-updating features seems to have been removed. Using version 5.2.2 here. <comment311130> Ditto @GeorgeC in v5.6.2. The best you get on double-click is a button to `Set to Today`: http://i.imgur.com/4zTCOse.png <comment373502> Workaround using Numbers and pasting into Pages.
