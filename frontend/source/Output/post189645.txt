iTunes playback getting frequent (5+/min) dropouts <body> I'm having the exact same symptoms as this user. However, I don't (like that user) have FileVault on, nor are my hard drives sleeping whenever possible (as per energy saving settings).  My music playback keeps dropping out for a second or so, several times per song (5+). No crazy CPU usage or anything like that.  Ideas?

Machine, OS, RAM, drive type, memory/swap/CPU usage from Activity Monitor, etc... <comment224950> Could [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5551788?tstart=0) help you? please [edit](http://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/189645/edit) your question and add details of your hardware. <comment224953> Do you have any other media players installed? Also check your sound output settings in System Preferences  Sound  Output. Also, try using hedphones, headset or different speakers. It could be the hardware problem <comment224973> I have Quicktime. Output device is internal speakers.
