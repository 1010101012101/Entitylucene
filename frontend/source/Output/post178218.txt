Is there a way to send Google Notifications to the Mac OS X Notification Center or to Growl? <body> Is there a way to send Google Chrome Notifications (you know that annoying little bell in the menu bar) to the OS X Notification Center? Instead of receiving notifications in different positions and styles (native OS X Notifications, Growl, Chrome Notifications), I would like to see them in one place - the OS X Notification Center.  Is there an easy way to configure this, or a tool that can help with doing this?  strongUpdate/strong  I've found Hiss, which allows to send Growl messages to the OS X Notification Center, which is great, since it minimizes the number of notification styles.  In addition to the question above, is there a way to send Chrome Notifications to Growl? That might allow to use Hiss to finally route them to the OS X Notification Center.  <answer278962> On Chrome 57 for the Mac, go to codechrome://flags//code and find the strongNative Notifications/strong settings, enable them and restart Chrome.
