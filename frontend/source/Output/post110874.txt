What is Wifi-Networking option under system location services in iOS 7? <body> I've noticed an option called Wifi-networking and I can't seem to figure out what it does, exactly.  <answer110875>    Crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cellular Location Services      If Location Services is on, your device will periodically send the geo-tagged locations of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple to augment Apple's crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations. In addition, if you're traveling (for example, in a car) and Location Services is on, a GPS-enabled iOS device will also periodically send GPS locations and travel speed information in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple to be used for building up Apple's crowd-sourced road traffic database. The crowd-sourced location data gathered by Apple doesn't personally identify you.   iOS 7: Understanding Location Services  <comment130531> More info here : http://ipod.about.com/od/UsingiOS6/ss/Using-Iphone-Privacy-Settings-In-Ios.htm <comment154494> So are they paying to help them build their database? Of course not. Turned it off. <comment216262> No, they're not paying us to help build the database, but they also don't charge us to use it. It's your prerogative to turn it off if you wish, and there are certainly legit reasons to do so. But "because they don't pay us" isn't one of them.
