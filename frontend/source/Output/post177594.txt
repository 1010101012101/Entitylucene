To install Brew's ImageMagick and fix its Symlink <body> Assume you installed Imagemagick by  precodebrew install imagemagick /code/pre  but it does not get into your PATH.  For example, I run unsuccessfully   precodecompare /code/pre  since imagemagick is not in PATH: code-bash: compare: command not found/code.  The command codels -l /usr/local/bin/compare/code gives  precodels: /usr/local/bin/compare: No such file or directory /code/pre  My .bash_profile  precodeif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then     source ~/.bashrc fi  # http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/53058/15504 export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH /code/pre  Echoing code$PATH/code gives   precode/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/texbin /code/pre  which seems to be ok because code/usr/local/bin//code there.   h2ImageMagick in my system - answers to 4ae1e1's answer/h2  The command codebrew --prefix/code gives code/usr/local/code so ok.  The command codebrew info imagemagick/code gives  precodeimagemagick: stable 6.9.0-3 (bottled), HEAD http://www.imagemagick.org /usr/local/Cellar/imagemagick/6.9.0-3 (1440 files, 22M)   Poured from bottle From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/imagemagick.rb ==&gt; Dependencies Build: xz ✔, pkg-config ✔ Required: libtool ✔, xz ✔ Recommended: jpeg ✔, libpng ✔, freetype ✔ Optional: fontconfig ✔, libtiff ✔, little-cms ✘, little-cms2 ✘, libwmf ✘, librsvg ✘, liblqr ✘, openexr ✘, ghostscript ✘, webp ✘, fftw ✘ ==&gt; Options --enable-hdri         Compile with HDRI support --with-fftw         Compile with FFTW support --with-fontconfig         Build with fontconfig support --with-ghostscript         Build with ghostscript support --with-jp2         Compile with Jpeg2000 support --with-liblqr         Build with liblqr support --with-librsvg         Build with librsvg support --with-libtiff         Build with libtiff support --with-libwmf         Build with libwmf support --with-little-cms         Build with little-cms support --with-little-cms2         Build with little-cms2 support --with-openexr         Build with openexr support --with-perl         enable build/install of PerlMagick --with-quantum-depth-16         Compile with a quantum depth of 16 bit --with-quantum-depth-32         Compile with a quantum depth of 32 bit --with-quantum-depth-8         Compile with a quantum depth of 8 bit --with-webp         Build with webp support --with-x11         Build with x11 support --without-freetype         Build without freetype support --without-jpeg         Build without jpeg support --without-libpng         Build without libpng support --without-magick-plus-plus         disable build/install of Magick++ --HEAD         Install HEAD version /code/pre  which seems to be ok.

Where did you get stuck?  Do you know how to use the command line?  Have you read the ImageMagick manual pages?  You haven't given us much in the question to work with, so it's hard to know how to help you.  We expect you to make a serious effort on your own before asking here, and to show us in the question what you've tried and what happened. <comment210207> Basically you just run it from Terminal with the options you want. From your question it's unclear whether running from Terminal fails, whether you don't know how to use it to accomplish a specific task or whether you have a different problem. So please clarify by editing your question, it will then automatically placed into the reopen queue. <comment210228> what does `type compare` return? and `ls -l /usr/local/bin/compare`? <comment210229> Ahh, and which error message to you get on running `compare`? <comment210257> Please try `type -a compare` and `ls -l /usr/local/bin/compare` as patrix suggested. <comment210273> Okay, then `compare` is simply isn't there. <comment210275> I'll give you a list of things to try shortly. <comment210280> You are right! There is some error in symlinking. See my update. <comment210281> I did *rm '/usr/local/bin/convert'* and *rm '/usr/local/share/man/man1/convert.1'*? <comment210282> @Masi That's not the best thing to do. `convert` is an ImageMagick command, so I'd say it's safe to just do `brew link --overwrite imagemagick`. If you want to be overly cautious, you can do `brew link --overwrite --dry-run imagemagick` to have a look at the list of overwritten files first, but I'd say that's not necessary. <comment210284> By the way, maybe you installed some non-Homebrew software that provided a `convert` binary in `/usr/local/bin`? Could you run `convert --version` to make sure it's actually the ImageMagick `convert`? <comment210285> The convert --version was ImageMagick's command. I removed the two files and now successfully reinstalled the imagemagic. I now have *compare* in my command line. Thank you for your answers! <comment210286> Great, glad it helped. <comment210287> What is the purpose of the command **hash -r**? I get nothing in running it. I always tend to run **reset** after each installation. <comment210288> @Masi `hash -r` rehashes the list of commands known to the shell. It helps with autocomplete and stuff, so why not. `reset` has little to do with your shell environment, it just resets the terminal and helps with nothing but printing issues. <comment347480> maybe it's a bit useless now, but this simple solution worked for me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13998161/osx-lion-cannot-remove-imagick
