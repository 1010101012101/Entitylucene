Where is the specific driver for my GPU located <body> I am trying to run a bitcoin miner (bfgminer), I know this is not efficient but I want to do it anyway.    The mac in question is a MacMimi running an Intel HD Graphics 4000 GPU and Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3615QM CPU @ 2.30GHz.  The os Mac OSX 10.8.5.  I have outlined my problem on the bitcoin stackexchange site. I also did a google search and duckduck search with various combinations of the terms "Where is the specific driver for my GPU osx".  I am trying to hard specify the GPU driver for gpfminer when it starts as it is not detecting the GPU.  strongWhat is the location of this driver on OSX?/strong   bfgminer specifies that is should be in the form of codeerupter:/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART/code  <answer112777> On OSX the drivers are in code/System/Library/Extensions/code  You'll find 3 files starting with codeAppleIntelHD4000Graphics/code.   <comment132406> Thanks, they are directories.  I just tried AppleIntelHD4000GraphicsGLDriver.bundle/ AppleIntelHD4000GraphicsVADriver.bundle/ and neither works,... any other thoughts? <comment132407> What about the kext (kernel extensions) ? <comment132409> No, go. When I specify  `/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIntelHD4000Graphics.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleIntelHD4000Graphics` as the driver. <comment135231> Where does bfgminer give that path - and is that for OSX or is that a Linux path? <comment135258> It is an OS X path.
