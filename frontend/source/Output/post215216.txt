El Capitan - Where to install application <body> I'm developer and I'm providing my application with pkg installer. Before El Capitan, my installer was putting binaries to code/usr/bin/code. With El Capitan I had to change it because of SIP, so now binaries go to code/usr/local/bin/code. According to some reports code/usr/local/bin/code is accessible only for sudoers, "regular" user can't access it. What should be the right location to install my application, so every user could access it?     <answer215217> For command line tools accessed by any user, code/usr/local/bin/code is the best location.  h2System Wide Requires Admin/h2  That codesudo/code may also be required is also correct. An administrator should be required to make changes that affect other users of a computer. Ideally only users who are administrators can make system wide changes.  Practically this means your Installer package should strongrequire admin rights/strong to be installed. Installer.app will take care of enforcement for you.  h2pkgbuild/h2  Hopefully you are using codepkgbuild/code to create the Installer package.  If so, make sure you pass the destination path code/usr/local/bin/code using the code--install-location/code flag.  Avoid embedding standard parent folders in your package and installing to code//code. No package should need to install directly to code//code.  This will ensure any existing code/usr/local/bin/code folder path retains its permissions and your package does not damage any existing settings. If the destination path does not exist, Installer.app will create it for you.  <comment259930> If it was in /usr/bin before you needed admin rights i.e. use sudo before - regular accounts should not have been able to modify /usr/bin
