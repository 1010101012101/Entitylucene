Cannot Mount NTFS devices on Yosemite <body> I've recently upgrade my iMac to Yosemite. So far, NTFS devices (such as pen dirves or hard drives) were not a problem, but with Yosemite I can't even mount them.  I can see the devices with the Disk Utility app but whenever I try to mount them I always get the same message "Disk could not be mounted" with no further explanations.  I've tried Paragon and Tuxera with no results. Could this be a USB driver problem?  <comment221561> You asked _"Could this be a USB driver problem?"_, have you tried mounting a FAT32 formatted USB device? <comment221562> Yes, and it worked fine. <comment222306> I succeded yesterday: I had to mount it manually from the shell: mount -t ntfs /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/usb_folder. Still, I have no write permissions.
