In Pages 5, how to get a table to span multiple pages? <body> I have a two-column table in a document in Pages 5. The table starts mid-way down a page with content above it.  When I add rows to the table, if there isn't enough room to fit the entire table on the same page, the ementire/em table jumps to the next page, leaving a big empty gap in the document.   How do I get Pages to instead start the table at the original page, and span the table onto the next page instead?  <answer209324> Looks like it happens because "Prevent widow &amp; orphan lines" option is activated by default.  Select the text where the table is located, in the Inspector panel look for "strongMore/strong" and uncheck "strongPrevent widow &amp; orphan lines/strong". I had the same problem and found the solution this Apple Support Communities thread.
