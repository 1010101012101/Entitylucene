MacBook Pro 2015 heating when using Radeon <body> I am using MacBook Pro 2015, EL Capitan 10.115. It has 2 GPU, Intel Iris and AMD Radeon.  The problem is, whenever it use AMD Radeon (connect to external monitor, open google maps, etc), it's heating. I saw in activity monitor, there is this kernel_task that uses very high CPU.  It's very annoying, and sometimes make my mac very slow.  Any idea how to fix this?  <comment310475> First of all, update to 10.11.6. Secondly it might be a hardware issue, are you using any software to manipulate the fans? Could the fans be full of dust? Does it get the same temperature when using only Apple Apps? Could be some software you installed that cause the kernel task to go wild. <comment310476> Well, it's happening since long time ago. Even before El Capitan. And I upgrade regularly, but I haven't update to 10.11.6.  No, I don't use any app to manipulate the fans.  Yes, I use safari to open google maps, and it's heating. Any apps that need Radeon will make it heating. Even when I only connect to external monitor, with normal usage. <comment310478> How warm is it? Perhaps its an expected behavior, the computer is cooling it self through the case. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201640 <comment310482> @Niklas currently, I am just using external monitor and open google maps, and it's heating until 70 Celcius (based on the istat app). It can be hotter. The fan is spinning very loud.
