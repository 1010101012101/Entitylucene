Save web page as PDF and keep hyperlinks <body> I am having an issue with Safari. I want to be able to save web pages as PDFs and keep the hyperlinks in the PDF file, however Safari doesn't do this for some reason.  It works on all my colleagues computers, who are all running on the same version of Safari (5.1).  When I save as PDF I go to File  Print  PDF  Save as PDF. Is there anything I am doing wrong?  <comment262110> Are you sure about the Safari version, 5.1 is rather old? Are your colleagues using the same procedure as you do? Did you try "File  Export as PDF" (if this is already available in 5.1)? <comment262111> Yep, I am sure about the version. For various reasons we are not able to update it. As I said, it works for my colleagues, not me
