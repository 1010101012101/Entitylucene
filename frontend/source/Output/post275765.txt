Huge lag in remote screen access in server app <body> I am using vnc viewer to gain remote access to my mac server, with server app 3, and I am facing a huge lag from server side. There I cannot see any issue because all seems fine, there is no overload of cpu, ram, ... . To access that network I use a VPN, but in both connections there is uplinks with fiber(100/10 and 100/100). This VPN is still using PPTP.  So my question is, any of you have noticed this, if yes what have you done to solve it and what remote screen access's do you use?  Thanks!  UPDATE 1:  I have already turn on is screen since this is a mac pro, and the lag continues. There is a lot of people refering that it needs a screen plugged in to use gpu instead of just cpu, not sure if its true or not, there was no difference here.
