How to batch rename files to random characters? <body> I have a lot of photos with me that I want to rename. I want them to be 10 random characters. Is there a way to do it?  I am running macOS Sierra.  I didn't try anything yet.  I would prefer a free solution to this problem.    <answer255937> Copy and paste this into a text file:  precode#!/bin/bash  cd "$1" for i in ./*; do     mv "$i" $((RANDOM * 32768 + RANDOM)) done /code/pre  Run the following command to make the file executable (assuming you've saved the file as coderandomlyrename/code):  precodechmod 755 randomlyrename /code/pre  And run the file:  precode./randomlyrename /path/to/folder/containing/things-to-rename /code/pre  Bear in mind that it'll rename emeverything/em in the directory it's provided to a string of random numbers ten digits long.  <answer255942> The following script assumes that the photos to be renamed are in your Pictures folder. This will rename every file in your Pictures folder to a 10 character random string of letters and numbers while keeping the file extensions intact.   precode#!/bin/bash  chars=( {a..z} {A..Z} {0..9} )  function rand_string {     local c=$1 ret=     while((c--)); do         ret+=${chars[$((RANDOM%${#chars[@]}))]}     done     printf '%s\n' "$ret" }  for file in ~/Pictures/* do     ext=$(echo ${file} | sed 's,^.*\(\.[^\.]*$\),\1,')     mv "$file" ~/Pictures/"$(rand_string 10)"${ext} done /code/pre  If the files to be renamed are not in your Pictures folder then edit code~/Pictures/code accordingly. The code~/code is simply a shortcut for the users home directory. So code~/Pictures/code = code/Users/YourUsername/Pictures/code. Note that the code*/code tells the script to match any file found in code~/Pictures/code. Also note that you can change the number of characters generated by changing the number code10/code of code(rand_string 10)/codeto any number you like.   ul liCopy and paste this into a strongplain text/strong file and name it something like: rename_pics.sh/li liOpen your Terminal (use spotlight to find it if you don't know it's location)/li liIn your Terminal type codechmod 755 rename_pics.sh/code and press Enter/li liThen type code./rename_pics.sh/code in your terminal and press Enter to run the script./li /ul  <comment318979> @perhapsmaybeharry your script removed all the file extensions. Anyway, I've already found my answer from another user and I've accepted it. Thank you so much for taking the time out to help me :) I really appreciate it :) <comment318980> Thank you so much! Your solution works flawlessly :D <comment318982> By the way, is there a way I can rename without changing the extension? I mean right now I have three different scripts to rename the jpg, png and mp4 files. First, I'll place only jpg files on the Desktop then run the jpg script on the desktop and then move the files to another folder. I'll do the same process for png and mp4 files. It would be better if the script renamed all the files without changing it's extension. <comment319001> Thanks a lot @danielAzuelos It worked! :D <comment319009> @danielAzuelos Thanks for the `sed` magic. I have incorporated this into the answer. <comment319010> You're welcome :).
