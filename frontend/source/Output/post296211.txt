Downgrade iOS from 10 to 9.3.5 in iPad mini 2 <body> I have an iPad mini 2 Wi-Fi, model ME280BZ/A. It is currently running iOS 10.3.3. For testing purposes, I need to downgrade the iOS to 9.3.5. I have tried several ipsw files, but all seem to be unsigned and therefore iTunes cannot restore the system.  Is there a signed ipsw for this model and iOS version? Is there a way to sign an ipsw and restore it via iTunes?  Please note that I do need a device running this system version and not the simulator which doesn't necessarily behave as the physical device.
