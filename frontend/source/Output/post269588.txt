How does /usr/bin/java work on Mac? <body> I found code/usr/bin/java/code linked to code/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java/code. And its file content is different from code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java/code. But when I type code/usr/bin/java -version/code it prints  precodejava version "1.8.0_121" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)  /code/pre  So I'm curious about the implementation of /usr/bin/java and wondering why it can always point to the latest version of my JavaVirtualMachines?
