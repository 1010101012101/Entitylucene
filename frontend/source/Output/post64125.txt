Can i extract from my iPhone browser the history older than 8 days ago? <body> It looks like that the data older than 7 days are automatically wiped from the iphone.  What's the database that stores that data, in case one exist, so that by jailbreaking my iphone i can have direct access to it and hopefully, extract the data i need?  If i did this yesterday, i would not have had this problem... :(  <answer64133> Look into Ecamm's PhoneView, it can backup iPhone browser history as well as texts, voicemails, and calls.  <answer64149> You're looking for codevar/mobile/Library/Safari/History.plist/code. Try looking in that file, but I'm pretty sure Safari itself will only store the most recent seven days of data in that file, though. You'd have to make a tweak that modified Safari to extended that time frame.  <comment75245> Unfortunately I already tried that and it displays the same things as of the iPhone history interface. <comment75246> Well yes, it does. Why exactly do you need your old history? <comment75556> I should have visited a linkedin page of a google employe i need to contact... lol :)
