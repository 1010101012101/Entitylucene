User account no longer in ‘admin’, how to recover? <body> After a recent OS X update (currently Sierra, 10.12.3) the normal user on this machine is no longer in the codeadmin/code group.  I don't know what caused the account to be removed from that group; how can I get it back?  hr  Advice found via I don&#39;t have administrator account on my mac suggests booting to Single-User mode, and using the codedscl/code command:  precodedscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership username /code/pre  This fails immediately:  precodeCould not read path: path = /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist, error = 2: No such file or directory /code/pre  and no change in groups occurs. Apparently I can't expect codedscl/code to work in Single-User mode.  So what should I do, to re-add the username to the codeadmin/code group?  <answer271989> After starting to Single User Mode enter:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /sbin/mount -uw / /code/pre  Launch opendirectoryd:  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist /code/pre  Then enter (replacing emusername/em with the real user name):  precodedscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership username /code/pre  You will get an error "...com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist doesn't exit anymore ..." - ignore it! Your user should still get promoted to an admin user.  Enter codeexit/code to boot to the GUI.  <comment341737> None of the answers mention a `dscl ..` command - a link in a comment does though. You have to add some details (i.e. what have you done so far and what are you trying to do) to your question.
