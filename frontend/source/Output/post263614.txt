Firefox suggestions in the awesome bar stopped working in macosSierra <body> I am using FF 55.0.2 (which is the latest). Since last few days awesome bar stopped working.  It is not providing any suggestions when I type website addresses that I have already visited. I checked and I can confirm that FF is recording the browsing history.   Restarting FF in safe-mode with all addons disabled also didn't work. All the other browsers are working fine. I have also reset and reinstall FF to standard setting, even that didn't work.   I have replaced my FF with a nightly build thinking it could be a bug with FF, but that didn't helped. To me, it looks like some system level setting which is preventing the suggestions from happening.  Anyone facing this issue? I'd appreciate any help to resolve this.
