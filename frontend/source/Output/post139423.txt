open multiple files in one emacs window <body> I can open a file in emacs with this command:  precodeopen -a Emacs main.cpp /code/pre  But when I apply the same command to multiple files  precodeopen -a Emacs main.cpp test.cpp /code/pre  two emacs windows will appear. I would like to open them in the same emacs window, is this possible?  <answer139424> Instead of starting Emacs with codeopen/code you can use codeemacsclient/code to send files to an already running Emacs. For this to work you need to start the corresponding server inside emacs by including  precode(server-start) /code/pre  in your emacs init file.  <comment164398> One window or one instance (one running Emacs application)? <comment164400> One window, multiple buffers.
