Cannot use or update WMware Fusion in Mountain Lion <body> I was using VMWare Fusion 3.0 in Snow Leopard before upgrading to Mountain Lion. Now I cannot open or upgrade VMWare Fusion, the icon is blocked, and if clicked, a pop up comes out and if click help, another popup telling me that nothing is available.   How to upgrade and use VMWare fusion again?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AItAL.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wmw2x.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXg6N.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer57814> The latest version of VMWare Fusion is version 4. If you want to use VMWare on Mountain Lion, unfortunately you can no longer use the old version. This VMWare blog post says:     h3Does VMware Fusion 3 work with Mountain Lion?/h3      No. VMware Fusion 3 was released in October 2009 and was optimized for Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard.  VMware Fusion 3 is no longer being updated for newer versions of Mac OS. Customers wishing to run VMware Fusion on Mountain Lion should use VMware Fusion 4. A free 30-day trial is available for current VMware Fusion 3 users. The trial can be found here: http://www.vmware.com/go/tryfusion
