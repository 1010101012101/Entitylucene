How to unlink an AppleID / iCloud Account from an iPhone that's been used 3 times? <body> I work at a place where they re-issue iPhones to various employees.  One of these iPhones has been re-issued at least 3 times.  Which means that there are at least 3 Apple ID/iCloud accounts that have been associated with this iPhone.    The procedure was to wipe the phone ( Settings  General  Reset  Erase All Content) and then create a new Apple ID / iCloud account for the new user using the phone.  However...today we got a message that said codeCanâ€™t Create AppleID/code codeThis device is no longer eligible for creating a free iCloud account/code, and I believe that is because three people had accounts associated with it before.  I've tried loggging into their iCloud accounts on http://apple.com/find and the device is not listed there as it is preportedly supposed to be so I can unlink it.  <comment224433> did your company use the company-program of Apple when buying the iPhones? <comment224451> @Gabkano Ya got me...I didn't buy them...which phone companies have that? <comment224467> @Gabkano Are you referring to this? http://www.apple.com/business/vpp/ <comment224468> Hmm maybe this is how Apple stops Businesses from not participating in their VPP program; would have been nice if they told us that upfront. <comment224473> @Gabkano Or are you talking about DEP: https://www.apple.com/business/dep/ <comment224474> no the details aren't important,but if you ever got in contact with Apple to buy phones for a company( as I don't think someone from your company went to the AppleStore and bought 100 iPhones or so) you probably got information about a person you can get in touch if you got problems with devices, especially in those cases. <comment224475> We don't really have an Apple Store here...we have two companies at the mall that sell them. <comment224477> or that, but you know what I mean <comment224531> I haven't done this so I'm not 100% positive, but I think you can goto http://appleid.apple.com and use the create Apple ID button there, then use that appleid as an existing when setting the phone up. <comment227963> @Tyson That was it, thank you.  Add it as the answer if you like.
