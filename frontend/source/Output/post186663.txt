process to reliably connect Mac Wi-Fi to iPhone personal hotspot? <body> Is there a recommended process for reliably connecting a Mac to an iPhone Personal Hotspot network via Wi-Fi?  Here is the method that I have been trying:  ol liturn on WiFi and Personal Hotspot on iPhone/li liturn on WiFi on Mac/li /ol  This works maybe 25% of the time, and the other 75% of the time the Mac scans the Wi-Fi networks but does not see my iPhone hotstpot network.  I keep repeating the above process until it connects.  If I connect instead via "Join other Network..." and input my network name, security, and password, that sometimes works, and other times says "No network found."  If I connect via USB cable or Bluetooth, that reliably works every time.  I tried dropping the network and re-adding it on the Mac, but that didn't help:br     codeSystem Preferences &gt; Network &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Advanced &gt; Wi-Fi (tab) &gt; Preferred Networks &gt; (select my hotspot network) &gt; ("-")/code  Also, is there a way to force the Mac to rescan the Wi-Fi networks?  iPhone: iPhone 6br iOS: 8.3 (up to date as of 11 May 2015)  Mac: MacBook Pro Retina 15" (Mid 2012)br OS X: Mavericks 10.9.5 (13F1066) (kernel: Darwin 13.4.0)  <answer187316> @tubedogg's suggestion fixed my problem: make sure the iPhone has the codeSettings &gt; Personal Hotspot/code screen visible when I attempt to connect with the Mac.   I've done that now the last 5 or so times and it's worked every time.  <comment220434> How good is the phone's 3/4G connection at the time you try to connect? I've noticed if it's not fully up & running, it doesn't hand out the hotspot. <comment220646> Note that for the network to be visible to other devices, you MUST be on the Settings  Personal Hotspot page on iPhone. If not, it cannot be connected to. <comment221336> Thanks @tubedogg!  That fixed my problem!
