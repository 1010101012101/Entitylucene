Is it possible to quickly clear flags in Apple Mail 6 ( probably with AppleScript)? <body> I'm running Apple Mail 6.2 on OS X 10.8.2.  I'm wondering how to clear flags easily, maybe a button exists or a shortcut is possible? Currently I need to press the down arrow in flag button and click "clear flag", which is really inconvenient.  I think strongAppleScript/strong is highly promising, but I don't know how to do it.  <answer77225> According to this thread, copy below script into Apple Script Editor and then run  precodetell application "Mail" set selectedMessages to (selected messages of front message viewer) if (count of selectedMessages) is greater than 0 then     repeat with theMessage in selectedMessages         set flag index of theMessage to 1     end repeat end if end tell /code/pre  Your selected message will flag with Orange. You can flag message with other color by replacing 1 in the script  <comment89551> Great. I tested it out and discovered that to clear flag just replace the index with -1. Thanks.
