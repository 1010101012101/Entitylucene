How to force Mac screen resolution? <body> Whenever I connect my Mac FireWire-to-HDMI to a large-screen TV, the resolution on my MacBook Air 11″ becomes larger and more content fits on the screen. In other words, everything scales emdown/em and it looks great. I'd like this resolution to be forced at all times. This option is only available when the MacBook Air is output to a larger HDMI screen.  Here is what the settings panel looks like with the desired resolution:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JafX3.png" alt=""  <answer200086> The setting you wish to adjust is the strongembuilt-in display/em/strong correct?  Your screenshot is for the external.  To change the built-in display on a retina screen running Yosemite:  ul liUnplug your HDMI (as in normal use)/li liGo the the strongDisplay preferences/strong (  strongSystem Preferences/strong)/li liSet the display to strongScaled/strong and strongMore Space/strong./li /ul  Play a bit with it to get the look you desire.  Note: this may affect performance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XfdYz.png" alt="Display pref"  When connected: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1JoHG.png" alt="Settings"  <comment241098> I did as you said. I do not see that option.  [Preview](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1333628/SHARED/my-mac-resolution.png) <comment241099> Again, that is your EXTERNAL display.  You should have another for the Air itself. <comment241103> See updated answer <comment241104> Where is the internal display option? <comment241117> Usually on the Mac screen. It may be hidden beneath the other. <comment241119> Found it. That preference screen also doesn't show a scale feature like yours did. Tell me why that is?

But you can set yours to the highest res to get the effect you want all the same.  Hope this worked for you! Cheers <comment241141> I'm already on the highest res.
