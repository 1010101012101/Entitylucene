Numbers: is it possible to add multiple select elements? <body> I'm working on template in Numbers. Some cell in template can have only specific values from code lists, so I decided to add pop-up format for them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zXRJw.png" alt="enter image description here"  But some cell can have multiple values from code list, so what I need is to add multiple select box (where I can choose several values from dropdown list). Is it possible to do with numbers?  <answer189579> Unfortunately it is not currently possible to make multiple selections from a dropdown list in Numbers.  One possible work around would be to use multiple columns.  Then use a formula to CONCATENATE the cells into a single string.  Not very elegant.
