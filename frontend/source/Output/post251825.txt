How to check ethernet connection speed in AirPort Extreme/Time Capsule? <body> One time I found physical ethernet connection speed in strongAirPort Utility/strong (showing 100 or 1000 Mbit/s connection) but now I can't find this feature. Anyone knows how to check this without connecting APE directly to the computer? I need this info in native network environment.  <comment313117> I doubt this is still available in the new AirPort Utility. I usually just look at the switch itself to see what it's negotiating at.
