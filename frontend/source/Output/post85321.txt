Can't ping a linux server with MacOSX. Software related <body> I'm having an huge problem with my Mac, from months.  I have at home a linux server, a CuBox. It's running Archlinux, running fine. Everything works.  But the Mac can't ping the CuBox.  I will paste you a little log of what a ping gives.  precodeRequest timeout for icmp_seq 669 Request timeout for icmp_seq 670 Request timeout for icmp_seq 671 Request timeout for icmp_seq 672 Request timeout for icmp_seq 673 Request timeout for icmp_seq 674 ping: sendto: No route to host Request timeout for icmp_seq 675 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 676 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 677 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 678 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 679 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 680 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 681 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 682 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 683 ping: sendto: Host is down Request timeout for icmp_seq 684 /code/pre  And this cycling again and again. The issue is Mac software related, on Windows (Boot Camp) I can ping the CuBox.  With the help of reddit, http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/19vbwf/mac_cant_ping_linux_server/ I made it working for 2h. The next day, (after making the computer sleep) the problem happened again.  For making things works 2h, I have played with sharing settings, disabling and enabling again. This trick is not working anymore now.  I really need to access to this CuBox. If anyone have a clue, please tell me what to test!  Thanks.  <comment98312> What does your routing tables says ? ( `netstat -r` ) <comment98314> What does your firewall say? <comment98326> What happens when you ping your router's IP address? What happens when you ping the IP of the Linux box instead of its host name? <comment98351> netstat -r - http://paste.placeholder.fr/show/202/ No firewall on both. I ping always ip.
