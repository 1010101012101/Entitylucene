Find all hidden files that were hidden using the command "chflags hidden filename"? <body> I remember to hide an important file, but I can't find it anymore and I don't remember the name. I don't remember how I hid it, i.e., if just by inserting a prefix of code./code or using codechflags hidden filename/code.  I tried to recover all hidden files (hidden because of the prefix code./code) under my desktop using the following command  precodefind . -name '.*' | grep "^.DS_Store" &gt; hidden-files.txt /code/pre  and the resulting codehidden-files.txt/code text file is empty. (Anyway, I'm not 100% sure if the command above is correct.)  Again, now I would like to retrieve recursively (as I'm doing with the previous command) all hidden files that were hidden using the command codechflags hidden filename/code using the terminal (or without, but I would need to have a list of them or a path to them). Is it possible? If yes, how can I do it?  strongEdit 1/strong  I think the command above doesn't work because codegrep/code does not accept input. Anyway, to solve the problem I think I just need to add codexargs/code as follows  precodefind . -name '.*' | xargs grep "^.DS_Store" &gt; hidden-files.txt /code/pre  <answer228972> This should work for you  precodefind . ! -name '.' \( -name '.*' -o -flags hidden \) /code/pre  which means find in the current directory, all file system objects, except do not list the current working directory- (code! -name '.'/code), whose name begins with a dot or file flag is set to hidden.
