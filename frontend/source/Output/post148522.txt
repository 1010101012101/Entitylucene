Unable to extend my partition <body> I have searched through this site alot and i wasn't able to find any solutions.  My situation is the following: I decided to install linux to dual boot with OSX at my 1TB fully encrypted with FV2 hard drive. I opened the disk utility and i shrinked the main partition to 500GB. I created another one with 500GB to install linux there. Right after i did that, i changed my mind :S and wanted to expand the OSX partition again to be 1TB. This is what I get - everything is greyed out and I'm not able to do anything: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yp4PA.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jNoOU.png" alt="enter image description here"  I 've tried to reboot and boot with cmd+r to enter the system recovery and run disk utility from there - the results are the same. I 'm desperate:/  <answer148528> It seems that i did it using this post Unable to Resize Partitions and your comment.  Although it wasn't obvious for me, what I did was this:  precodediskutil corestorage resizeStack LOGICAL_VOLUME_UUID 0G /code/pre  0G to expand it to the maximum available space that is free.  precodediskutil corestorage resizeStack /code/pre  can provide with info.  <comment174918> I cannot find how to mark it as solved :/ <comment174922> I have FV2 switched on. I don't know what and how to resize with the cmdline "diskutil corestorage". Could have you got any more specific advice? <comment184905> THANK YOU SO MUCH! I was using `resizeStack` unsuccessfully because I couldn't find the exact right size to put in and it was creating an invalid volume. I didn't know 0G would just take up all available free space!
