Disable outgoing mail for an account? <body> I have an account that I want to receive but never send email from in Mail.app. Is there a simple way to disable this one account?  I'm running Mountain Lion.  <answer69485> There is an option within the preferences of Mail.app.  Go to the "Accounts" tab, and select the email account, and under strongAccount Information/strong, you can set the outgoing mail server to strongNone/strong.  You must also enable strongUse only this server/strong.  When sending a message from that account, you will now get a message asking you to choose a different outgoing mail server, with the option of cancelling the send.  <comment80722> I can confirm that what you suggested works in Mountain Lion. <comment80741> This doesn't actually do anything; you can still send messages without a prompt. It just picks one of the other servers to send with. <comment80743> Setting **Use only this server** causes a prompt to appear.
