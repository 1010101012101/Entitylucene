How can I configure Mac Terminal to have color ls output? <body> How can I configure Mac Terminal to have color ls output? I am using MacOS 10.5  <answer33678> You can add  precodealias ls='ls -G' /code/pre  to your code~/.bash_profile/code to get colored codels/code output.  <answer33679> Edit:  precode~/.bash_profile /code/pre  or  precode~/.profile /code/pre  and add the following two lines:  precodeexport CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=ExFxCxDxBxegedabagacad /code/pre  you can use this if you are using a strongblack background/strong:  precodeexport LSCOLORS=gxBxhxDxfxhxhxhxhxcxcx /code/pre  <answer33680> If you want a readable mac os x terminal color scheme, you may want to look into this:  http://toddwerth.com/2008/01/25/a-black-os-x-leopard-terminal-theme-that-is-actually-readable/  and the version for Lion:  http://toddwerth.com/2011/07/21/the-original-ir_black-for-os-x-lion/  I've been using this for over a year now, and I might not be able to function without it!  <answer40491> Another option is to use the GNU codels/code which is part of the 'coreutils' program.   You can get it via Rudix or Homebrew (codebrew info coreutils/code)or Macports or Fink. That might be preferable to using a "Mac OS X-only" solution if you use the same shell config files on different systems, or are already familiar with GNU ls.  <answer47731> Also you can customize the prompt color (and its format) by adding:  precodePS1='\[\e[0;33m\]\h:\W \u\$\[\e[m\] ' /code/pre  to code~/.bash_profile/code or code~/.profile/code file. Where code0;33/code is regular yellow which looks nice in my black/semitransparent terminal window.  Here is a full list of colors and their explanations: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_Bash_Prompt  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGgca.png" alt="My awesome terminal window"  <answer64856> Forget all those decades-old cryptic codes for gosh sakes, use the built in Terminal -- Preferences... Settings pane to set the default skin, and edit the ANSI colors to your liking. You can set the font, too. I prefer Menlo 12pt. This is how any regular Joe can do it, and avoid all the crazy command-line, unix-esque way of doing things as other posters have suggested.  <answer151429> Personally, I'm using Oh My Zsh for adding color and other tricks to my Terminal. I think that is the easiest way.     oh-my-zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing   your Zsh configuration.      It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins,   themes, and a few things that make you shout…   <answer186358> I find that all I need really is adding this to my code~/.bash_profile/code  precodeexport CLICOLOR=1 /code/pre  <comment38418> This is a great question...  I've always expected ls --color (a la gnu ls) to just work everywhere.  MacOS doesn't accept --color, so I assumed that it didn't have colored output as an option at all. <comment38419> Mine is alias ls="ls -Gp" — the -p adds a slash after each directory. For me, it provides that much more visual differentiation, which is helpful. <comment38420> I see your `-p` and raise you a `-F` which in addition puts an `*` after executables, `|` after pipes, `@` after symlinks, et cetera. <comment38421> Just for fun, throw in a -h, which will format sizes in "human readable" units, i.e.  100b  10k,  23m, 4.2g <comment38422> If you don't have a .bash_profile already at ~/.bash_profile, be sure to source it, so that it will work.  Do this with "source ~/.bash_profile" <comment38423> Or `gxBxhxDxfxhxhxhxhxcxcx` on black background <comment38424> As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal allows customizing the ANSI colors, so using SIMBL or other extensions is no longer necessary. It also supports 256 colors. <comment75201> It's useful! Thx! <comment76200> I think anybody experienced enough to even know that `ls` can have colored output is also able to run a few Unix commands to configure it correctly. <comment76205> +1 for pretty much perfect irony. <comment76645> But this just makes ls show in one colour it does not make links, directories, files show in different colours as ls can do <comment134265> I'm using LSCOLORS="ExGxBxDxCxEgEdxbxgxcxd" to emulate the default colouring on the linux ls command <comment134266> @geoffhoffman be trollin' yall <comment144636> Thanks Jamie, this is just what I needed, I really wanted to keep default colouring. <comment181971> Is there a way to make the colored text not look bold? <comment209993> This answer could benefit from some additional details. e.g., the difference between the two environment variables, and pointing out that all you really need to do is set `CLICOLOR` to enable colors in ls. Setting `LSCOLORS` is only necessary if you want to customize the colors/attributes. <comment224787> Dunno if this has changed since 2011, but you can replace the alias with `export CLICOLOR=1` to accomplish the same thing. <comment238397> Or `~/.bashrc`. <comment260263> For the creative people, you can devise your own color scheme with this [online tool](http://geoff.greer.fm/lscolors/) <comment261878> For the record, I usually prefer *not* to `alias` `ls`, because 1) If you actually memorize the command line parameters (which aren't that difficult to remember and type out), you'll be able to achieve the same behavior and output on multiple systems where you don't maintain an updated personal `.bash_profile`, and 2) because many times I like to pipe my `ls` output to other commands in order to execute operations on files/directories in the output, which always fails if there is a `*` or a `@` included in the filenames (without first piping to `tr` or `sed` to remove the unwanted characters). <comment275912> The terminal has to be closed and opened again for the modifications to have effect. <comment303805> doesn't appear to work on capitan ): <comment305078> I found this (and up-voted it) in July 2015, when running Mavericks.  Now on El Capitan (using the same `.profile` file, it no longer works.  I can check the values using `echo $LSCOLORS $CLICOLOR` and they are as defined but it no longer works.  Any reason this would be the case? <comment318384> ok. then i advise to put  `-t` to sort by date <comment327173> @EnricoMariaDeAngelis You don't have to close the terminal, execute "source ~/.bash_profile", this reloads the file. I guess it'll work too if you edited .bashrc <comment347637> Worked like a boss in El Captian for me, thanks for posting @Filype <comment359129> There is also nice LSCOLORS generator: https://geoff.greer.fm/lscolors/ <comment366598> @JamieCook I find Mikulas' colors more linux consistent. Specifically, a broken symlink should be dark red. With your lscolors its blue... this is not a small issue.
