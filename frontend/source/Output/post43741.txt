iPhone 4S does not pair with any bluetooth headset <body> I have an iPhone 4S that does not pair with any bluetooth headsets. I've tried Jabra, Plantronics and Jawbone products.  It just keeps searching for the device but never finds it.  <comment49710> have you put the Jabra/Plantronics/Jawbone device into discoverable mode? <comment49711> yes. have been using with 3gs but just doesnt work with any product from 4GS <comment49743> I use a Jabra Extreme with my 4S without problem. I'd expect BT on your 4S to be faulty. It may need to be repaired or replaced. Presumably, it's still in warranty? <comment49834> Thanks. Have no choice but to go back to Apple. Thanks for your time
