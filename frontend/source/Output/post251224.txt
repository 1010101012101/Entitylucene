Disable shift key slow animations from command line <body> The sole answer for Remove shift key augmentation for Mission Control animation that works is a GUI-based answer. I like to store all of my mac configuration in a version-controlled dotfiles repository so I can quickly get back to ground zero when I make a new mac.   How can you disable the shift key slowness that occurs when you do Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow and Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow strongfrom the command line/strong?  I've tried codedefaults write com.apple.finder FXEnableSlowAnimation -boolean false; killall Finder/code, which I found at How to disable slow motion effect in Mac OS X (shift key)?. This does not work for me.   <answer251411> I believe you'll have to log out and back in for this to work.
