Launchpad folders showing icons within as blank squares with dashed lines <body> There's a peculiar thing happening in my launchpad. On opening it up anytime in general, all the folders show no icons in them but blank squares drawn using dashed lines, the icons don't come back even if I wait a while. If I go inside a folder, the icons are there. If I close launchpad right away and reopen it again immediately, the icons are there. I am almost certain this started after upgrading to Sierra.   Of course, if I do codekillall Dock/code, it works but only until I reboot/logout. The other thing advised to do in this case is to remove the code.db/code files in code~/Library/Application Support/Dock/code but that location is empty on my machine.   This isn't at all a showstopper, but is certainly very odd, and I would like to do something about it, if there's something reasonable that can be done about it, as a long-term/permanent fix.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/waWEM.png" alt="screenshot"  <comment346498> I once had the same problem, but interestingly it was *resolved* by rebooting. <comment349254> There seems to be a solution [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/256122/launchpad-failed-to-show-app-icons-contained-into-folders), but I'd like to do that without having to reorganise my launchpad from scratch.
