Double and triple notifications <body> When activating Calendar app I get double and triple notifications on my appointments - for example birthdays, holidays etc. How can I get rid of these double notifications?  <answer181900> I assume you have local calendars and iCloud calendars.  Make sure that the events and birthdays are only in one calendar. I had the same problem before. After consolidating my calendars and moving them to iCloud it was fixed.
