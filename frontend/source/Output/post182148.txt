Does apple actually name classes as WTF? <body> In the screenshot below, find the stack trace and look at the last stack(s). Is that just a programmers (@Apple) frustration or is there any acronym? I tried looking for some meaningful values img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vG7NV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer182158> The strongWTF/strong stands for strongWeb Template Framework/strong, which is a part of strongWebKit/strong.  <comment216730> What screenshot? There isn't any. <comment216734> Sorry forgot to add that. <comment216737> They do on the iPhone, not sure about the Mac though
