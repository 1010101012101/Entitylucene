How to convert .dmg to Directory-folder <body> I just Create one Directory to .dmg file using Disk Utility. Can anyone Please Tel me how to convert .dmg file in to older Directory-folder.  <answer82346> Mount it, and then copy?  Why won't that work?  <answer265340> Mounting it first is definitely what Apple intended with the format, but I recently found a sketchy (via CNET) version of a package and was curious how it differed from the official version. I didn't trust OS X to mount it without potentially auto-running any malware it might have, so I just wanted a clean filesystem extract.  Turns out, (p)7-zip can do it! Supposing your disk image is named codesketchy.dmg/code:  precodebrew install p7zip 7z x sketchy.dmg /code/pre  Which will extract everything in the image into the current directory, not necessarily into a new subdirectory like double-clicking code.zip/code files in Finder does.
