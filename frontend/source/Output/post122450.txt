Force Preview to open all selected images in one window <body> Before mavericks, selecting several images in Finder and choosing Open on them would open them in Preview in emone/em window, with all image thumbnails nicely on the left hand side bar. Since Mavericks, this is no longer the case. Sometimes the selected images all appear in one window, sometimes Preview arbitrarily open some images in one window and other images in another window... How can I force Preview to open all in one again?  <answer122486> Short answer: you can’t. This is a bug in Mavericks.  What I do is:  ul liOpen the group of images/li liClose all windows in Preview if it has opened more than one window (shortcut: kbd⌘/kbdkbdalt/kbdkbdw/kbd)/li liRe-open the same group of images/li /ul  Most of the time, I have all my images in one window the second time I open them.  <answer138484> Had the same problem. It's simply in the prefernces setup "open images in one window"  <answer147344> I keep the Preview.app icon in my dock (OS X 10.9.5). Drag and drop a folder of images onto the Preview.app icon. This will open all images in a single Preview window.  <answer178596> Before reading zinne's answer, I avoided the problem by using emQuick Look/em instead of emPreview/em. It can be found in the context menu of selected images, between emMake alias/em and emShare/em, at least in my Maverics 10.9.5.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DcdDt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment187643> Great idea, it works well! <comment187644> This is true, that's an answer! Someone give this guy the green check! <comment235809> Ironic answer? Maybe I should check it just for the sake of it. <comment279878> to be more precise:  preferences  general   open all files in one window. <comment319938> @jQwierdy No it's not. You probably had another problem than the original question. However it's great if your problem is solved! <comment360675> This does not fix the issue / bug described by Jonny <comment374002> Great alternate solution which provided me with exactly what I needed for my specialized needs.
