How do you type ~ on the iPhone's keyboard? <body> The iPhone keyboard has support for typing characters like Â¿ by selecting a similar character on the keyboard and holding the key for a short time. However, there doesn't seem to be a way to type a ~ character (a tilde). How does one do that?  <answer139330> On keyboard, press the "123" button to bring up numbers. From here press "#+=" to bring up more characters. ~ is the 4th from the left, second row.  Answered on an iPhone :D  <answer223498> It depends on the language of the keyboard. In the German keyboard it is the strongthird/strong from the left, second row. In the English keyboard also. And in the SwissGerman also, and in the Dutch also.  <comment164331> So I'm just completely blind then. Good to know :)
