TFTP Server on 10.6.6 <body> How do I enable an existing TFTPd within 10.6.6 ?  <answer9123> Do you need to run it with any special settings?  By default, it runs chrooted in /private/tftpboot; if you want anything different in the setup, edit /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist as appropriate.  Then, activate it with:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist /code/pre  <comment9646> May need to sudo that. <comment9648> @Spiff: D'oh!  Fixed. <comment9696> default's is fine.. my only problem is  mbp:~ alexus$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist bind(): Address already in use com.apple.tftpd: Already loaded mbp:~ alexus$ <comment9709> It sounds like it's already activated.  Try `sudo launchctl list com.apple.tftpd` and see if it gives you a differently-formatted dum of the .plist (if it's loaded), or an error message (if it's not loaded).  Also, try `sudo lsof -i:tftp` and see if it shows launchd listening on the tftp port (note that launchd will start tftp when it sees incoming traffic on the tftp port).
