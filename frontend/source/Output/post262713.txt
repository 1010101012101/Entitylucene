Uninstalled apps still appear in settings <body> I have deleted an app with intentions of reinstalling, but when I clicked App Store and searched for the app, instead of showing the option to download it's showing "open" as if I still have the app. I've turned my phone off and back on multiple times but it's still there. Can anyone help get my app back? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/58VY5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer262784> Try this  ol liBack up your iPhone (use a password on the backup)/li liWipe your iPhone: settings  General  Reset  Erase All content and Settings/li liRestore your iPhone from the backup you just created./li /ol  The ghost icons should be gone  This whole procedure should take less than an hour. Possibly much less depending on how much needs to be backed up and if your Mac &amp; iPhone support USB3 speeds.  <comment329106> What happens if you tap on "Open"? <comment329107> Nothing. It just keeps saying open <comment329277> Would you have to back up on iTunes, or is it safe to back up on iCloud ? <comment329314> I always back up locally as it is a LOT faster. EG you are not constrained by the speed of your WiFi to your phone and the vagaries of download speeds imposed by your ISP. DO it locally, you'll be glad you did.
