How to make Font size equal to 15 in Terminal on Mac OS X Yosemite? <body> Here are the configuration settings for the Terminal app in Yosemite.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jG8D4.png" alt="enter image description here"  It shows that I can set font size to the distinct values given in Terminal. How can I set it to some other in-between value like in my case, I want to set it to "15"?   <answer198527> Here is what I did in OS X Yosemite 10.10.4.  Terminal (menu)  Preferences...  Settings  Select the target Profile  Text  Change... (button)  This brought up the Fonts window shown in the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fqny6.png" alt="Fonts1"  I then resized the Fonts dialog box vertically until the Size text window appeared and entered 15, as shown in the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HCEyX.png" alt="Fonts2"  <answer257177> You can also add custom values for font sizes. From the Font window, click the gear in the upper left, and choose "Edit Sizes".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsP3T.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then, enter your value.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CRWxS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment237556> You just won my heart buddy. Really thanks for it. That was awesome. <comment237558> My two cents - try iterm2. If there isn't any particular reason for sticking to Terminal - use iterm2. <comment237560> My two cents - try terminal.
