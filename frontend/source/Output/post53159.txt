Can I restart my Mac remotely via screen sharing if the screen shows only linen? <body> I am currently in Norway.  My Mac mini is in my apartment in Australia.  I can access screen sharing via Back To My Mac.  It connects fine, but the screen has only linen - no menu bar, no dock, no anything else.  I am fairly sure that is what is actually on the screen and that it isn't a problem with the connection or anything like that (it's happened once before while I was sitting in the same room...)  I know the system is responsive because the one other thing that can poke through my router is the Transmission web interface, and that works just fine.  (Unfortunately I seem to have neglected to forward a port for ssh...)  Is there any way I can reboot or otherwise regain full use of the system via the limited screen sharing access that I have?  <answer53160> In this page says that emControl-Eject/em show you a shutdown dialog. (You need a keyboard with an emeject/em key.)  <answer53325> So apparently you can use the Back To My Mac infrastructure to get to SSH even if there's no port open on the router in front of the relevant Mac:  Find your iCloud account number by executing this command in terminal:  precodedns-sd -E /code/pre  Example output  precodeLooking for recommended registration domains: Timestamp     Recommended Registration domain 23:45:15.660  Added     (More)               local 23:45:15.660  Added                          icloud.com                                              - &gt; btmm                                              - - &gt; members                                              - - - &gt; 123456789 /code/pre  (Make a note of the number on the last line, in this case em123456789/em (this is just an example).

Replace spaces with hyphens, and omit apostrophes (the default name is "Name's &lt;type of Mac&gt;")  The command I used therefore was:  precodessh -2 -6 Jons-mac-mini.123456789.members.btmm.icloud.com /code/pre  To complete the solution to my problem (rebooting), once logged in via SSH, I used the following command to restart:  precodesudo /sbin/shutdown -r now /code/pre  (Sourced from here)
