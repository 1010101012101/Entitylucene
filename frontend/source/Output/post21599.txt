How do I make a custom ringtone for my iPhone using iTunes 10 only? <body> I'd like to use a snippet of a song I have purchased as a ringtone for my iPhone. Is this possible using only iTunes?  I have found a few guides on the web, but I can't seem to complete this task following these guides. I might be misunderstanding something, or the guides are out-of-date, or incomplete.  I am looking for a solution that will be useful for an extended period of time, for others who see this question. There are similar older questions, but I'm interested in iTunes version 10 on the Mac.  <answer21600> As far as I'm concerned (this has worked for my iPhone, and is covered in this guide as well), it works like this:  ul liIn emImport Settings/em, choose the AAC Encoder./li liGo to the library and right-click the song you want to use. Select emInfo/em, and then the emOptions/em tab./li liHere, set a time period using the emStart/em and emStop/em markers. This period shouldn't exceed 40 seconds./li /ul  Now, let's convert it to the appropriate format.  ul liClick OK, and right-click the song again. Select "Create AAC Version"./li liLocate the newly created AAC file ("Show in Finder" works on a Mac). It should reside in the same folder as the original, or in your iTunes library. Its extension will be code.m4a/code./li liRename the extension from codem4a/code to codem4r/code./li /ul  Clean up and re-import:  ul liRemove the AAC file from your iTunes library (do not move it to the Recycling Bin/Trash though)/li liRe-import the codem4r/code file by dragging it into iTunes/li liDrag the newly imported file to your iPhone/li /ul  <answer21601> Use GarageBand. Set a loop region (on the menu, strongControl - Loop Region/strong) under 40 seconds.  When you're done editing click strongShare - Send ringtone to iTunes/strong.  <answer43925> Personally, I use the same method as @slhck. However, if you had any trouble following his instructions, here is a handy-dandy webpage for you to use that comes with helpful pictures!   <comment23752> I think you can just do it by connecting your iPhone, then selecting it from the list on the left.. Then one of the tabs (Music, Movies, Books, etc) has an area where you can select tunes to be used as tracks. You may have to first edit the properties of a track to some how mark it as usable as a ringtone too. I think how this all works has changed a few times too. You may want to post the version of iTunes you're using too.. <comment23753> This is how I do it, and I confirm it works for me (from the same guide too). <comment23754> Could be merged with: [How do I create a custom ringtone for my iPhone?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1884/how-do-i-create-a-custom-ringtone-for-my-iphone) <comment23755> The OP asked about iTunes only. <comment23758> Greg - I'm guessing you want to bypass the "official" way with the ringtone tools that automate the editing, looping, conversion but costs additional $ at present?
