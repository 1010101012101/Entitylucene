Fresh Install of Mountain Lion on MacBook Pro Retina that upgraded via a voucher <body> I want to do a fresh install of Mountain Lion. I bought my MackBook Pro before Mountain Lion was out. Later I got my free download voucher and used it to upgrade. Now I want to do a fresh install, but I'm unsure how to download Mountain Lion again without paying for it.  I tried redeeming the code again in the App store, but I get an error saying this code has already been used.  Any ideas?  <answer72018> It turns out Mountain Lion will be available under your Purchases list. Go to codeStore -&gt; Purchases/code and you'll see it there with an option to download.  <comment105518> Came here to say this.  The vouchers basically act as gift cards, only they are for a specific download.  Because of this anything downloaded via a voucher will typically be treated the same as any other purchase.
