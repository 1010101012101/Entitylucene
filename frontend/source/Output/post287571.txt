How do I search for an App in iOS11? <body> In iOS10, by pulling on the Home Screen, I could search for an app. How do I do this in iOS11?   When I pull down from the Home screen, I see a message "Earlier Today" only. If I scroll down, nothing happens. If I scroll up, I see the Camera.app.  If I have a new message, that shows above the "Earlier Today" message.  Thanks for any help.  This is beta 2.  Edit... Adding a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/33CEy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If I press Home, I see all my first page icons. If I then scroll up, I see the Control Panel. I can't seem to get a screenshot of this. It shows icons for brightness, and mini images of my open apps. I don't see a search option.  <answer287572> It's the same as iOS 10. Pull down on the home screen (from somewhere amongst the apps, not from the top of the display) and a search bar appears at the top. Type the name of the app you want to look for and the results show in the Siri App Suggestions section.  <comment363093> This still works. Scroll down the proposals. It's below them. <comment363108> I would not have asked if I found this the same as in iOS10. So I don't appreciate the down vote for trying to figure something out. I'll add to my question. Any help appreciated. <comment363110> @David I didnâ€™t downvote you; are you able to expand on exactly what you see has changed, apart from it going from a vertical list to a horizontal list, preferably with a screenshot? <comment363112> What do you mean by "Proposals" please? <comment363114> If you start typing, results are shown for emails, visited websites, app store etc. (depending on what you configured in the settings). I called these results proposals. If scroll down, below you will a "search web" or similar. (I'm using the German version, so I can't exactly tell the words in English. ) <comment363115> Oh I see only now that you are using the beta. Sorry. Don't know for sure then. <comment363116> apologies for my harshness. <comment363117> Whoever downvoted you should give a reason. It's not polite to just downvote, IMO. <comment363118> @David You're pulling down from the very top of the display. Instead, just pull down from somewhere in the middle of the home screen. Thanks for providing a screenshot, I've upvoted the question <comment363119> Bingo! Thanks so much! Could you post this as an answer please. I'm sure it will help lots of people. <comment363120> @not iOS 11 is *only* in beta, what do you mean? App results are shown at the top in iOS 10 and 11, no need to scroll down. <comment363121> @David Excellent, I've edited my answer <comment363124> If it's not configured, app results won't show. Maybe it's a configuration issue (General - Spotlight search). Re beta, I mixed up version numbers. Mea culpa. <comment363125> Ah okay. Thought you were seeing results, but not the ones you were looking for. <comment363126> However, is that any different from ios 10? <comment363129> I think it's different. On my wife's iOS10 device, if I scroll from the top of the Lock screen, I see the search options. It does appear to be the same from the App pages. So you are correct. It's just that my expected behavior did no longer works. Thanks for your help though.
