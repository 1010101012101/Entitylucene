How do I fix Excel 2008 Date Formats in Mavericks <body> I have Excel 2008 installed on my Mac, which I recently upgraded to Mavericks, migrating all my settings across.  Previously (on Mountain Lion) when I entered a date like code11/12/code this was interpreted as code11 December/code, but now Excel insists on interpreting this in American format.  All my existing data (some going back years, originally entered in Windows) displays correctly as I have entered a custom Format codeddd dd/mm/yy/code, but displays incorrectly in the formula bar.  As far as I can tell, my system settings are correct for Australia - they were migrated across, and I have since checked. Numbers seems to have no problem with dates.  <answer264329> After some searching and trial-and-error, I have identified that the issue relates to the absence of a key file: com.apple.HIToolbox.plist, which for some reason is not created when setting up a new User account (and may not be copied across if importing from another computer). Luckily this file is created when opening the Guest account, which can then be copied across to all required User accounts.  Here is a detailed summary of the procedure I eventually used to fix this date format issue:  ol liCreate and open a Guest Account (if not already enabled, go to Users &amp; Group Preferences)/li liGo to the Library folder (it’s a hidden folder, so to find it, use Finder to go to the home folder, then select from the menu ‘Go:Go to Folder’ and type in ‘Library’)/li liGo to the Preferences folder /li liMake a local copy of the file: com.apple.HIToolbox.plist (e.g. onto an SD card, or external/cloud drive) /li liNow open your desired User account /li liGo to your Library folder (again it will be hidden, so find it as above) /li liGo to the Preferences folder /li liCopy the file: com.apple.HIToolbox.plist (from local storage) into this folder /li liQuit Excel and then log out of your user account, and then log back in /li liNext time Excel starts, UK date format will be correct!/li /ol  (Source:  http://www.yellowsbest.com/solved-uk...excelmac-2008/)  <comment135888> I've got the same problem too, so you're not alone. Language & Region settings are correct, but Excel still assumes date input is in US format, so, e.g., entering 6/1/14 produces the date 1st June 2014. (Default date display format in Excel also changed to MM/DD/YYYY, which I'm 99.999% sure wasn't the case before, though I'm not reinstalling everything just to double check.) It's driving me nuts. <comment331278> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. Also, please don't use AD to just get more traffic for your own site.
