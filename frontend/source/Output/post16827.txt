Is it possible to rotate images in Preview in degrees other than 90? <body> I want to rotate an image in preview but I only need to move it a few degrees.  Is this possible?  Or can you only rotate 90 degrees?  <answer16828> Unfortunately, Preview can only rotate in 90* increments and flip images.  If you want to rotate a different amount, you'll have to use a more-powerful program, like Photoshop or Pixelmator.

Small and fast.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLV4U.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer60570> If you're not averse to using the command line you can use the sips command to rotate images. For example…  precodesips -r 23 --padColor FFFFFF image.jpg /code/pre  …will rotate image.jpg 23 degrees clockwise and "fill in" the empty space with white. (If you rotate PNGs the alpha channel should be retained.)  Worth reading the man page for sips as it can do other useful stuff.  <answer110565> Apparently, it used to be possible by holding down the option key while rotating (using the button on the toolbar), at least according to this forum entry from 2005:  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2005012115382953  But it didn't work for me on OS X Mountain Lion, all the option button did was change the rotation direction (for the rotation button on the toolbar).  <answer124030> There is a way to do it using Preview, although it is imprecise.   You can use a two finger twisting gesture to arbitrarily rotate the image within preview. Now, it snaps back to normal once you let go, but if you take a screenshot to clipboard while maintaining the rotated view, then paste from the clipboard into preview, then save. Then I open the image again and do a little bit of cropping to get it looking nice.  I mapped the 'screenshot to clipboard' function to a key combination that was easy to hit while maintaining my twist.  Obviously a dedicated app will do the job better, but I thought it was worth mentioning my OS only workaround which I discovered.  <answer157259> It's possible to do this by copying or opening the object in a separated window, then there you can rotate it. Next, just copy back the object already at the desired position. This is the only way I've found, and works for quick tasks.  <answer211007> In Yosemite, open the image in Photos and crop it - this function brings up a grid and alignment tool, you can then save the image simply aligned, but not necessarily cropped.  <answer251257> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wXdTP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You CAN rotate by degree increments in Photos. Just click "Edit" and then go to "Crop Image". You get a live preview of the rotation as you drag in a similar way to Lightroom.  <answer260855> Eventually i got the same problem but i found out you can't really rotate it other than 90 degrees   <answer278086> I found an online website that does it (probably there are many others):  ul liLunaPic (http://www140.lunapic.com/editor/)/li /ul  No need to register or install anything. Just upload the picture, type how many degrees should be rotated and done.  <answer287481> Copy-paste the image into another image or new file (cmd+N) and twist the pasted object with two fingers.  (as shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvE2DHJOTCE)  <comment18384> Thanks.  Ended up using Gimp.  Was just hoping it was possible without having to open up a whole new program. <comment130231> Now on the Mac App Store, still free: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toyviewer/id414298354?mt=12 <comment254734> The OP is asking how to do this in Preview. <comment259420> Wow maybe someone at apple read this because it is now a (somewhat hidden) feature in preview. Simply cut and paste an image and you can use the two finger twisting gesture to rotate the image. <comment277338> neat, didn't seem to take negative angles so had to go into the hundreds. :-) <comment305120> Marvelous. I wonder why something so basic is not available in Preview app.   @PatrickT: It works for negative angles too. <comment312260> The OP is asking how to do this in Preview, not in Photos.  Your answer was already provided. - From Review - <comment365023> This really helped. Thanks!
