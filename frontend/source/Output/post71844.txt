how to put the two fingers right click(secondary click) on macbook with Mountain Lion <body> I have a late 2009 macbook which has the trackpad with division, unlike the ones that are in market right now. I upgraded to Mountain Lion(10.8.x) but I forgot how to enable the Secondary two fingers right-click. Can someone help to get it working.  Thanks,  uDaY  <answer71849> System Preferences  Trackpad  Secondary Click  "Click or tap with two fingers"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jZPea.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment83462> Sorry  I have seen this, but I dont find this kind of GUI only... my trackpad has division which dates back to 2009 macbook(white) models..
