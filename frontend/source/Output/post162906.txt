Windows 8.1: how to update Broadcom driver without using external drive <body> I am looking for a way to update a Broadcom driver without using BootCamp or external boot drive.  I have a Macbook pro mid-2012 (non-retina) and successfully had Windows 8.1 running on it, except it does not detect any ethernet and wifi devices.   I used Bootcamp through which I believe I got the latest Windows-support drivers and firmwares.  I do not have access to any external drive to build a boot drive and to any network which I might download softwares directly from a Windows partition. The entry point is the OS X partition.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   <answer162913> Download on Mac from http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/downloaddrivers.php  Depending on write support, copy to Windows partition from Mac or from Mac partition in Windows.  If direct install doesn't fix it, try uninstall from Device Manager, reboot &amp; install again - seems to have worked for others.
