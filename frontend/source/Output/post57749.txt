Unable to install XQuartz on Mountain Lion <body> I have updated my Mac to Mountain Lion and now wanted to install XQuartz. However, the installer tells me that the installation failed and that I should contact the vendor. Did anyone else have this problem?  Thanks, Christoph  <comment66409> what version of XQuartz do you test? <comment66425> I tested the latest: "2.7.2". Strangely enough after a reboot of the system I was able to install the XQuartz package, I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
