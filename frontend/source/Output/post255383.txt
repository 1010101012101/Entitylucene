Add/disable layout when Magic Keyboard connected <body> I have MacBook Pro and Magic Keyboard. But this keyboard is from Japan, so it has different layout. I adopted it using awesome application codeUkele/code, created new layout. It works perfectly now, but the problem that I have two English keyboards layout one for MacBook itself and another one for Magic Keyboard.     Sometimes I switch to wrong layout and this takes some time to choose proper one.   So I am looking for the way to temporary disable layout (for example MacBook when MagicKeyboard is used) or just make it invisible in layout switch menu.        Or the better way would be to add replace keyboard layout back and forth when Magic Keyboard is connected.   I have experience in programming, so maybe it is possible to achieve this using specific system hook.  Please suggest the best way to get desired behaviour.   Thanks.
