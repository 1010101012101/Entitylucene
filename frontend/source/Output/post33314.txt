Fastest way to delete all Timemachine Backups for a machine <body> What is the recommended way to get rid of a whole TimeMachine archive (aka Backups.backupdb)?   Using Disk Utility to erase the whole disk is not an option.  I moved everything to the Trash, but "preparing to empty trash" was counting files to delete forever. I cancelled at -100,000 files.     So what's the recommended way to delete huge amounts of files?  <answer33320> If you're comfortable with using Terminal.app (located in Utilities folder), you can try using Unix codesudo rm -r &lt;path&gt;/Backups.backupdb/code command. Note that code&lt;path&gt;/code is the placeholder for the path to the hard drive where your Time Machine backup is located. Please be careful with the path that you pass to this command by ensuring there is no typo.   The complete steps are:  ol liLaunch Terminal.app /li liIn one of Terminal.app's window, type codesudo rm -R/code followed by a space/li liUse a Finder window to navigate to the codeBackups.backupdb/code folder, then/li liDrag that folder to the Terminal.app's window of step 2, and press the Return key./li liYou may be challenged to type the password for the admin account (which is usually the same user account that you logged into OS X)./li liThe default prompt will reappear in the Terminal.app's window when the deletion is done./li /ol  Type codeman rm/code for documentation.   <answer67200> If you've got:     Operation Not Permitted   after executing  precodesudo rm -rf Backups.backupdb /code/pre  you should follow this approach, which is adding codebypass/code before the remove command:  precodesudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass rm -rfv Backups.backupdb /code/pre  <answer196237> I found that link on the web, check on the website the time the information was stronglast modified/strong.  I've tried and it is reasonable fast.  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18855?locale=en_US  <answer257438> Once terminal is open, I used the following command:  coderm -rfv /path/to/folder//code  The coder/code means recursive, codef/code means forcefully, codev/code means verbose so you can actually see the files being deleted.   Be careful when using this command. You must specify the exact path otherwise there is no undo for this command (unless you have a backup which is wise).  <answer290282> Mattorb's approach works fine.  sudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass rm -rfv Backups.backupdb  However the path for Backups.backupdb can be more easily entered by dragging and dropping the folder into the terminal window after the command rm -rfv[space]  It still works if you have put Backups.backupdb in trash - all that is needed is to move it to it's original disc and then apply the above terminal command from there.

Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment234401> I fixed it, added the link address. <comment234476> Hope the answer is fine now, it is actualized, verified, recommended and a fast way to delete backup files. <comment263882> is `Backups.backupdb` the same as the `MachineName.sparsebundle` on the time machine volume?  I'm not seeing any backupdb files.
