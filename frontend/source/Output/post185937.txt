Apps will not download! <body> I go to the app store on my iPhone 4s, then I access the Updates section.  I select Update, on any app.  When prompted I enter my correct password, then a circle appears where the "Update" option was. After a short period of time spinning it reverts back to the Update button with nothing done.  If I enter an incorrect password, it says "incorrect password".  Why isn't it allowing me to update my apps and how can I fix it?  <comment219382> Did you already restart your phone? <comment219384> If restart doesn't work, next would be, from iTunes - sync; backup; restore [which would also insist you are on the latest iOS, if you're not already] <comment219399> i have restarted my phone. <comment219400> ill try the sync backup etc
