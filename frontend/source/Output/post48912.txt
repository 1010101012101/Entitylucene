How to print an image across two pages <body> I have a long image that's about 8 inches wide by 20 inches tall. It's open in Preview. For the life of me, I can't figure out how to get the top half of the image to print on one sheet of letter paper, and the second half to print on the second sheet.   Every time I try, it prints only on one sheet of paper. If I select Scale=100%, it prints a zoomed in part of the middle of the image on one sheet of paper, ignoring the top and bottom of the image. I tried Googling for an answer but the results are bad due to the generic-icity of the words "preview, print, mac, pages" - most of the results I saw were about printing multiple images on one page.  How do I print a PNG across multiple pages?  <answer48914> I've never done this but I'm guessing this will get you closer:  Don't print from Preview where there is no Page Setup menu option, try printing from another application like Pages if you have it (copy/paste  your image into Pages or another application).  Go to Page Setup in the File menu and under Paper Size make a custom page size of 8"x20".  Once you've done this you can scale your image (drag a corner) to fit the new page size.  Now if you put 8.5" x 11" paper in your printer and print "borderless" I'm not quite sure what will happen but it might work. It might work even if you can't print borderless.  Many who do fine art printing routinely print wide landscapes with roll paper but I'm guessing you don't have the tools for this.  <answer48936> If you want to stick with preview, a quick and dirty way to do it :  ol liOpen image in Preview/li likbdCMD/kbd+kbda/kbd to select all/li liGrab selection handle and drag until exactly in the middle of the picture. Dimensions of the selection will be shown while dragging the handle, dimensions of the whole picture can be found with the "Inspector" ( kbdCMD/kbd+kbdI/kbd)/li likbdCMD/kbd+kbdC/kbd and then kbdCMD/kbd+kbdN/kbd to create new image from selection/li likbdSHIFT/kbd+kbdCMD/kbd+kbdI/kbd to invert selection, kbdCMD/kbd+kbdC/kbd and then kbdCMD/kbd+kbdN/kbd to create new image/li liPrint your 2 images./li /ol  OR drag and drop the image into Safari and print it there. Safari will happily span it over several pages for you.  <answer56630> Here is how to use Safari to print an image to span multiple pages:  1) Open the image to be printed in Safari.  If it is a local file, then choose File - Open File....  Or if you already have the file open in Preview, you can drag the icon of the file from the title bar of the Preview window onto the Safari window or Safari icon in the dock.  Otherwise, load the image from the Internet however you usually would.  2) Go to File - Print... and then change the Scale (%) so that the image is the desired size. If you do not see the place to change the Scale, you may need to press the Show Details button. Safari will show you a preview of how the image will appear on each page, so you can see how big the resulting image will be.  For the example, you can get the entire width on a single page, but the image will span 2 pages in length.    You may want to choose borderless printing if your printer supports it.  For instance, for my Canon inkjet, I set the paper size to US Letter (borderless).  However, I was not successful in achieving borderless printing in my one trial; Safari still left white borders around the image that I later had to trim.  3) Click print. Collect your prize from the printer.  Trim away white space and then combine the different pages using tape, etc.  <answer81366> For PDFs:  At least on Mac OS X, the strongAdobe Reader/strong application (version 10+) has this feature in its print dialog. There's an option to print as "poster", meaning 100% scale across multiple pages.  <answer86701> Building on graup's answer, use Preview to export the image to a PDF, and then use Adobe Reader to print out the image in a poster format.  <answer123674> There are several programs that are designed for this:  ol liPosteRazor: Free. Functional (though ugly). Will cut raster image formats as you have requested. Will not cut PDF's./li liSplitPrint: $6. Powerful, and can be used from the print menu, but I have found it slightly difficult to understand./li liTilePhotos: $1./li liMindCad Tiler: $5. Highly rated by people I know who have used it./li liImprintStudio: $12.50. /li /ol  I'm sure there are others if you search, but these were the low fruit. Some of these only deal with PDF's, but will nonetheless allow you do drag from preview. At worst, you can always print to PDF and then open in these programs.  <answer125378> If you paste the pdf or image into Apple's emNumbers/em app you can print it across many pages.  <answer159570> For those who recommend using Safari, let me add that Safari does not care if your printer has margins. It will "cut" your image apart into the available empaper size,/em but hands that image over to the printer (which probably will knock off the ⅛"-¼" it can't print). When you assemble your image, it will look as if you're viewing it through window panes.  I use Adobe Illustrator and "Tile Imageable Areas," but since that solution is wicked expensive if you don't already have it, Sam Goody's recommendations should suffice.  <answer210769> an update to larsar - you can drag the picture into excel.  and then in print, choose scaling-- fit to 2 pages wide x 1 page tall. you might have to trim off a little bit margins after you print them out.  <answer212704> Increase the size of the image to 101% and the printer will give you the option. You will have to do some cutting to paste them together.  <comment93796> This is not what the Question asked for. He wants the print at 100% and not scale it down to fit the page. <comment100223> Welcome to Ask Different! This answer has already been given. You could make your answer stand out by describing the necessary steps in more detail, including screenshots etc. <comment200928> The answer does explain how to print across multiple pages; it just includes the option to tweak the size so you get the page dimensions you wanted. <comment208389> +1 Preview + Reader has not been suggested by anyone else. <comment217216> This is the only one that worked for me <comment218747> Maybe this method worked in an old version of MacOS X?  When I tried it in Yosemite, I set the scale to 100% but it just clipped the one page instead of printing across two. <comment256808> OP specifically asked about PNGs. <comment263005> You can use Preview to export any PNG as a PDF. This solution works well. <comment279740> I would appreciate more details in this answer. I tried to import an A0 PDF but it was scaled down to something slightly larger than A4. The print dialog wanted to print various page numbers, spreadsheet headers, etc, some of which were unobvious and/or challenging to disable. Could you please expand on the necessary steps to print an oversize PDF or image over multiple pages, with no additional adornments from the hosting app? <comment279742> Unfortunately, my Pages installation (Yosemite) did not have any option to tile the output. Maybe this also depends on the installed printer drivers?  I just got a small section of the middle of the large page I wanted to print. <comment279747> Just drop the pdf into a Numbers document. (It will get resized, but don't worry). Now, when you choose Print (cmd-P) you get a view that lets you see how your document will be split across pages.    Pull the _Content Scale_ slider to increase your print.  That's it! <comment279748> I managed to pull this off, but it's less than ideal.  As suggested at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2219021?start=0&tstart=0 I deleted the initial table in the empty document (select *Delete* from the Sheet1 drop-down menu) so I got a completely clean slate.  Then I did *Insert*  *Choose ...* to import my PDF. It came in much smaller but I was able to reset it to 100% (in the *Arrange* side pane, click *Original Size*) and move it to X0, Y0. Finally, *Print ...* brought up a preview where I could reset the *Content Scale* to 100% and set all page margins to 0. (Continued.) <comment279749> There is still a page number footer which I could not get rid of completely. You can remove the actual page number by double-clicking and backspacing, but the footer still takes up a strip of maybe 10mm at the bottom of each page, resulting in a grid of 25 pages, where the content would properly only require 16.  Printing pages 1-20 got rid of the strip of empty pages along the right; I then simply used scissors to trim the footer from each page, and the large amount of extra whitespace below the bottom, and finally assembled a 4x4 grid with duct tape on the back. <comment295370> Printed a png at 200% across four pages in El Capitan 10.11.5 using this method. <comment353021> Acrobat does a fantastic job of doing this.  It's a great way to print up mocks of mobile sites.  Thanks graup! <comment356996> I can't add an answer because I don't have enough reputation, but to add to the strategy of splitting the image into several multiple images, GIMP can do that easily and with precision (you don't have to eyeball it like some of the other suggestions): https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/30012 <comment361825> TilePhotos now $9.99 (June 2017)
