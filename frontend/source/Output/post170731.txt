How to open link in a new tab via shortcut in Chrome on Mac? <body> On Windows, I would just hold control, and click the 30 links on the page I wanted to open. How do I do this in Mac?  <answer170735> It will still take 30 clicks, one for each link, but…  Remember that kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd on Mac is usually equivalent to kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd on Windows.  kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd Click will open a link in a new a tab behind the current one, if you click a link.  kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd Click will open the new tab &amp; bring it to the front.  These are the default settings [iirc] but they can be changed in Prefs…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7gY7z.png" alt="enter image description here"  emEdit:/embr Sorry, I only just realised you said Chrome.br It does follow the same behaviour, though I can't find anywhere to actually change it.  <answer218197> Click and drag the tab out of the top bar.  <comment200786> so you click 30 times and open 30 tabs ? <comment200787> Holding CTRL just opens the right click menu. I need the shortcut to open up the link in a new tab... <comment200791> It must have been website specific, because I tried a number of guesses and nothing worked. Thanks! <comment321009> What are you talking about?
