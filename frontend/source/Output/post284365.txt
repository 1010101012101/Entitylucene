MacBook Pro 2016 SMC problems <body> I have a few problems with my SMC. I've already looked into every SMC reset options I have and tried them without success. The MacBook still has the same problems as before: loud fan, no brightness detection, Bluetooth doesn't work etc. So I thought my SMC was literally broken or something. The MacBook Pro is a late 2016 function keys model. The software WAS at 10.12.4.  A while ago MacOS Sierra Software Update 10.12.5 came out and I downloaded it without expecting too much. What happened though was that all of a sudden the MacBook Pro started to function normally again, as if the SMC had been turned back on; and not bypassed as I usually had to. Of course it was still running off DC power but the fan was controlled normally again, the backlight adjusted automatically and Bluetooth worked again. I pulled out the DC connector and it turned off, because, as I already mentioned, the Mac was on DC power. The problem seems to be the battery, which isn't charging. What I wanted to know is if there is a Terminal code for me to temporarily turn the SMC on, just how it was when I updated. Until I get a new battery from Apple when I send it in, a temporary fix would be very appreciated.
