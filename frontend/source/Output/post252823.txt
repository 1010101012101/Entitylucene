Can I use Philips Hue White Ambiance B27 Bulb for Apples Home Kit with every bulb fitting? <body> I want buy a Philips Hue White Ambiance B27 Bulb and want to know if I have to buy something special to use it or can I use it in any bulb fitting in my home?  I want it for my new borns room, so I can dim/turn off the light as soon as he sleeps.  PS: There is no Home-Kit tag at this stack avaible.  <answer252833> You will aslo need a Philips Hue Bridge. If you want to integrate it with  Apple HomeKit you need to have the newer bridge (square with round corners) and not the old one (circular).  <comment314585> And the new bulbs fit in my common bulb fitting? <comment314588> Yes, it fits in a regular E27 socket.
