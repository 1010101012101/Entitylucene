Removing a Word From the Spellcheck Dictionary <body> Somehow, the word codeprocede/code has made its way into my OS X system as a correctly spelled word.  If I type it in Text Edit, BBEdit, or Mail, the spell checker will strongnot/strong mark it with red underlines.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I5m1d.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fix this?  That is, how can I have my system correctly flag this word as incorrect spelled? The word does not appear in my   precode~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary /code/pre  file.  My system has strongno/strong files in   precode/Library/Spelling /code/pre  I've stared at the spelling and grammar options in multiple applications and don't see any obvious ways to tell the system to remove a word from the dictionary.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLw08.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer114349> Whilst many words are in ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary, there's also words contained in the localisation that you are currently in, such as strongen/strong or strongen_GB/strong.  Try looking in such files for the word. You can find which file it's in using the following Terminal command:  precodegrep -lr "procede" ~/Library/Spelling/ /code/pre  <answer232831> I'm still not sure what the ultimate reason for this is, but I was able to fix this problem by going to   precodeEdit -&gt; Spelling -&gt; Show Spelling Panel /code/pre  and changing the selected dictionary from emAutomatic By Language/em to emU.S. English/em.   <comment134002> +1 for good information, but it doesn't solve my specific problem.  Also — it seems like there should be a UI for this.
