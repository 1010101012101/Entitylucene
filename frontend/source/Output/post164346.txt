Is there a Developer and Inspect feature in Mail.app <body> Is there a Developer and Inspect feature in Mail.app?  Within Safari.app, I have a developer menu which includes an Inspect item which allows me to investigate issues with HTML in the browser.    Does such a feature exist in the Mail.app?  <answer164356> To inspect the underlying code of a message, you can use View  Message  Raw Source.    <comment192675> Which Mail.app - iOS or OS X? What version of the OS? <comment199842> Sorry, Not what I was looking for.   Viewing source (available using Alt-Cmd U) is helpful and also available in Safari - but it is not the developer inspect feature.
