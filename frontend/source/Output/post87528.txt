Preview does not save PDF form data <body> I downloaded the 2012 IRS 1040 form to my Mac to code~Downloads/f1040.pdf/code, running OS X 10.7.5. Upon opening the pdf file in Preview (codeVersion 5.5.3 (719.31)/code), I see fillable form data  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDFG0.png" alt="1040 form filled out"  I proceed to fill in more data, and eventually File - Save a Version  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RRKwr.png" alt="attempting to save"  Next I close the file, only to re-open it later and find all my entered data is missing. The IRS claims these forms are fill-in enabled:     Beginning October 25, 2004, new fill-in forms were enabled with   "document rights" which will allow you to save what you have filled in   on your PC. Version 8.16 or later of Adobe Reader is required.   And inspecting the security of the PDF confirms this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uoA2Q.png" alt="security"  Though, they also say Adobe Reader is required. strongMy question is/strong: what am I doing wrong? I expected saving a version to retain the filled in form information. A possible workaround would be File - Export every time I want to save something, but this seems counterintuitive.  <answer87533> I've run into this with some forms, it's not always clear why (although in your case the DRM seems the likely culprit). The workaround for me has always been filling it out as normal, then using the print to PDF functionality (strongFile → Print → PDF → Save as PDF/strong). Certainly not the easiest, and it means you can't re-edit in some situations. But it's still better than dealing with Acrobat.  Alternatively, you could buy PDFPen, which is a pretty fool-proof way of dealing with any PDF form you can find.  <comment102323> Adobe Reader 11 is free. Why not download it and use it instead of Apple Preview? <comment102370> I have Acrobat Reader installed, the behavior of Preview surprised me, hence this question. <comment102413> Well, then, you really have no problem! The IRS states that their PDFs are only compatible with Adobe Reader. They do not list compatibility with Apple Preview or any other PDF-manipulating software. So use Adobe Reader like the IRS instructs you to do.
