"open" from the command line just hangs using iTerm2 <body> The   precodeopen -a &lt;AppName.app&gt; /code/pre  is not working on one of my Yosemite based macbooks. The other one - also with Yosemite - works fine.  precodeopen -a TextEdit.app ~/out  (just hangs ) /code/pre  I have also tried other apps - to make sure the problem were not specifically with TextEdit. Nothing works.  Also I emam/em able to use Finder to open apps with TextEdit.  AFA the app's attempted:  let us look at a simple built-in one:   precode $open -a TextEdit.app ~/out /code/pre  Note that "open" has not been disturbed in any way: it is the one shipped with the MacBook  precode12:23:07/Applications $which open /usr/bin/open  ls -lrta $(which open) -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  92912 Sep 12  2014 /usr/bin/open /code/pre  <answer201074> It appears the issue were rather with codeiTerm2/code.   I tried the same commands on Terminal and it worked fine.  I do need some of the features of iTerm and am investigating which version(s) actually work. The one I am using (and does emnot/em work) is the one on the Download link.  So far I am having better luck with their iTerm 3.0 Alpha version.  <comment242371> On the system having a problem, from Terminal, execute the following command, as is, and reports if TextEdit opens normally to a blank document or still hangs. `open -a TextEdit` <comment242372> yes that hangs on iTerm2. I had realize a few minutes earlier that the issue appears to be with  iTerm2 (vs Terminal).
