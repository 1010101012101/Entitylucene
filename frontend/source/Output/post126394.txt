How can I get right-size this column to show entire filename? <body> How can I get right-size this column to show the entire filename in the Finder on Mavericks?  It used to work in previous OSs. I am in column view. Right-size all columns doesn't work either. It keeps leaving ... where the filename should be.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IxL2d.png" alt="Listing of filenames with ... instead of complete name"  <answer126395> Just double clic on the separator between the columns ;)   <answer139705> An even better solution I found is XtraFinder. It sets my Finder windows empermanently/em to right-size every column, so I can always see the entire filename. It saves me an amazing amount of time. I found it here: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/42067/xtrafinder  <comment148080> That works, except not in the Time Machine backups.backupdb folder. A double-click does nothing there for me. It only worked once. But I can't repeat it.
