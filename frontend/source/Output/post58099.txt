Macbook Pro Xcode Uninstall sedo .h files still there <body> I recently unistalled Xcode using Sedo developer in the terminal.  The reason I uninstalled is because every time I searched for something in finder, millions of .h and .m files would show and crowd my search.  After deleting as much Xcode files and folders as possible the .m, .h, &amp; .c files are still showing in my finder window when searching.  They are a different color now but still there.  I want to delete them badly, I just don't think I should, but I desperately would like them to not appear in my searches.  I don't understand why I still have the .h files after uninstalling Xcode.  Please help  <answer58100> May I propose two other options  ul liRemove the "Developer" category from Spotlight search results (in Spotlight Preferences)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jsR4g.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liAdd code/usr/include/code to the exclusion list (click '+' and then kbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd to enter the path)/li /ul
