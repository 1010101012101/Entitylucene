My apple TV Netflix app has weird default audio settings. Can I do something about that? <body> Note: in case it matters, I'm in Flanders, Belgium.  A few months ago, my nephew got hold of our Apple TV remote and randomly started pressing buttons while the TV itself was on a different channel (so I don't know what buttons he pushed). Ever since then, TV shows and movies on all profiles have been defaulting to either French or German audio tracks, even though the Netflix profiles themselves are configured to prefer Dutch or English. Even after manually changing the audio track back to what it's supposed to be, the next episode switches back to whatever the previous episode started as.  Examples:  ul liWanda and the Alien on the Kids profile has defaulted to French, and later German, even after changing the audio to Dutch and having the Kids profile configured to Dutch./li liThe Pink Panther (1963) has defaulted to French when I first started it, even though my personal profile is configured for English./li liElementary has started playing 1 episode in French. I manually changed it to English, finished the episode and when I started playing the next episode, it was in French again. This was again on my own profile that's configured for English audio./li /ul  This is really annoying, considering changing language settings on Apple TV Netflix is a finnicky task with multiple swipes and clicks on the swipe part, which can easily go wrong. Can I do something about these default audio settings?
