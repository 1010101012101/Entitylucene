How can I get information about a particular application's audio output? <body> I'm trying to figure out how I can interface with the audio subsystem in Yosemite (10.10.1). I've never done this is prior versions of OS X, but I imagine it has to be possible.  Is there any way to get a list of applications that have open audio "channels" i.e. are playing sounds? Can I get information about what kind of audio those applications are playing (bitrate, volume, data throughput, etc)?  On a Linux system with ALSA or PulseAudio, there are a ton of utilities for doing this, but I'm completely clueless about how to do it on my Mac.  <comment187221> Even though I'm an audio engineer, I don't actually know the answer to that question. I think the Mac [for any given o/p] transcodes on the fly, to match whatever your external or internal interface is set to. For my own purposes, I need to match my 'project' to 44.1/48k etc but I have never worried about what the machine is doing outside that. I can play a full audio project at 44.1, a final cut movie at 48 & iTunes at whatever the mp3 is doing, all at the same time from the same o/p.
