alias not working in terminal <body> I'm on a mac in Terminal.  precodeopen -a "Sublime Text 2" /code/pre  opens Sublmine Text 2, just like I want it to.  I now want to alias this to my .bashrc file, which I have an use for other things like prompt configuration.   precodealias sublime='open -a Submlime Text 2' /code/pre  doesn't work. Neither does  precodealias sublime='open -a "Submlime Text 2"' /code/pre  running   precodesource ./.bashrc /code/pre  doesn't help. Each time I am told  precode/Volumes/Belladonna/Blake ≈:≈ sublime  Unable to find application named 'Submlime Text 2' /code/pre  I'm doing this wrong and I know it must be a simple answer...  <answer218854> Either of these should work:  precodealias sublime='open -a "Sublime Text 2"' alias sublime='open -a Sublime\ Text\ 2' /code/pre  <answer218866> If you follow Sublime Text's recommended procedure of creating a symbolic link to their command line tool you will be able to open files, use as an code$EDITOR/code with git, subversion, etc… It gives much more power and flexibility over creating an alias.  In a nutshell you can use this command to create an symbolic link to the tool:  codeln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl/code  and then use the tool from the command line.  codesubl --new-window ~/.profile/code  will open your bash profile in a new window in "Sublime Text 2". You can also use the codesubl/code command without any arguments to open the app.  To get this to work you may need to add ~/bin to your code$PATH/code variable in your ~/.profile.  codeexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/code  See also Sublime Text's instructions.  <comment264625> You've misspelled Sublime Text? <comment264626> Backslashes will not work here, as you are already escaping the spaces with `'`. <comment264627> @DisplayName, actually it will :) <comment264628> No. It will look for an application that is called literally `Sublime\ Text\ 2`. <comment264629> @DisplayName, you could try it in a bash shell yourself. <comment264631> Sorry, I misread.
