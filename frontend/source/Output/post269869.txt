NSUserDefaults vs NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore <body> Both seem to store small amounts of keyed data to disk, and can be synced via iCloud. What then, are the intended use cases / differentiating factors, for these APIs?  <comment339073> NSUserDefaults are used locally (in general) while NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore always syncs to iCloud. <comment339090> Apple's Docs say not to use nsubiquitouskeyvaluestore because it isn't available when offline. Does it not save the keystore to disk? If so, why would one use nsuserdefaults? <comment339138> I have an app on the app store ([shameless plug](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noteflow-one-note-for-life/id1151254092?mt=8)!) and use NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore so it can sync with the Mac counterpart of that app; I tested it offline, it saves the note just like NSUserDefaults does.
