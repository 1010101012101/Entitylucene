How to skip OS X VNC connect password requester? <body> I have an Ubuntu server which I tend to use via VNC from OS X. For this, I have saved a .vncloc file from the built-in Screen Sharing client. When I click this icon, Screen Sharing connects to Ubuntu, but shows this requester already filled in:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JWFuk.png" alt="enter image description here"  Since I saved my password in my Keychain, I just have to press enter every time.
