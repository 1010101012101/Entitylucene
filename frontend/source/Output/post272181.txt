External display picture quality with closed/opened lid <body> The problem is that when I use external display with lid opened (so I'd have two monitors) the picture quality is noticeably worse (distorted colors, blurred text) compared when I use it with lid closed (only external monitor is active).  Just see the difference between language input icon: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Ien0.png" alt="opened/closed"  Is there a way to have the better quality when lid is opened?
