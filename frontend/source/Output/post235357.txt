See website visit time in Safari history (on El Captian) <body> I'm trying to figure out how to determine the time websites were visited in the Safari history. (I can't imagine why this isn't easy to do like in every other browser I've ever used).   I am running Safari 9.0.3 and El Capitan 10.11.3.  I have done some research and found some files in ~/Library/Safari. The file History.db file looks possibly promising but I haven't been able to figure out how to find the timestamp from this yet.  Thanks.  <answer235361> I just tried this in 10.11.4 and it works; you can see the history.  If someone clears the cache, this goes away.  Go to the following location:  precode/Users/yourname/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/History/ /code/pre  From here you can change the view to List View and sort by Date Modified.  <comment287877> Oh wow, thanks! <comment304287> still it would be nice if Apple work some on this - simple extension would be helpful like this for chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-history/obciceimmggglbmelaidpjlmodcebijb
