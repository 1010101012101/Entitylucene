keystrokes laggy/ out of order <body> My question is might be related to this old question: Keystrokes getting eaten randomly  When I type on my keyboard some keys just won't appear. Different from the other issue (link above) the characters will get typed later (lagging)  Say I wanted to type:  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"  it first appears as:   strong"Th quick ron fox jups ovr th lazy dog"/strong  then the letters get typed:  strong"Th quick ron fox jups ovr th lazy dogebmee"/strong  When the errors occur I might add a "backspace" and the result might look something like this:    strong"Th quick ron fox ps ovh lazy dobmee"/strong  I could not find anything online and I am not entirely sure which search terms to feed google to get an answer. It occurs at random times so it is impossible to reproduce.  This has been happening since I have this MBP (now 2 months old)  Stats:  OS X YOSEMITE  10.10.4br MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)br 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7br 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3br Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB    <comment237131> Have you tried a restart? (Just checking) <comment237143> is that a BT external keyboard. was there any liquid involved (accident). since it is only 2M probably best to use apple service. <comment237188> This has been happening since I have this MBP . So obviously I tried restarting reinstalling  etc.. I am not using any external input devices. Since the error occurs randomly I am quite sure apple won't fix it. I cannot reproduce the issue on request.
