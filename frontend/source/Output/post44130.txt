How can I limit my download bandwidth? <body> Sometimes, I require a lot of bandwidth  but do not want to disturb other's browsing experience.  At the university I'm often connected to networks for multiple users which requires me to limit my download speed.  h2Question/h2  How can I limit my download bandwith?  <answer44131> OSX provides codeipfw/code to define custom firewall rules. Using this tool you can create a pipe with limited bandwidth.  strongWhen you assign the throttled pipe to a specific port, this port's bandwidth is limited./strong  h1Quick How-To/h1  ol liCreate a pipe "1" limited to 500KBytes/s via  precodesudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 500KByte/s /code/pre/li liGuide all network traffic of port 80 through pipe "1" using  precodesudo ipfw add 1 pipe 1 src-port 80 /code/pre/li liWhen you don't need the pipe anymore, remove it from the port using  precodesudo ipfw delete 1 /code/pre/li /ol  h1Other/h1  ul liIf you want to set higher traffic barriers, you can use codeMByte/s/code/li liPort code80/code: standard port for unencrypted codehttp/code traffic.

QoS makes sure that bandwidth is apportioned appropriately and that no one process hogs the bandwidth.  Usually this is used on a client to make sure that essential network services always have required bandwidth to provide functionality. <comment180078> This is such an excellent answer!  Easy to use, goes away when you restart (so you can't accidentally screw up your computer), well explained, works for all apps.  Still valid on Yosemite too.  Thanks @gentmatt. <comment194931> ipfw is deprecated since OS X 10.9 and removed in Yosemite https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/ipfw.8.html <comment217519> For OS X Yosemite you can use Network Link Conditioner (from Hardware IO Tools for Xcode).
