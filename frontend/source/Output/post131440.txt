Why it shows "You are opening the application 'Xcode' for the first time? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zUrJR.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am running XCode v.5.1 in my Mountain Lion, I don't know why, but I'm getting this message after a successful start of Mac computer. I was already using this version of XCode before and now suddenly it's showing me this message? What's wrong? It is something that Apple forgets its my first run?  <answer131466> If you're not able to set the quarantine status on the app, then it will forever have that status and will prompt you. You can manually remove quarantine from the app withâ€¦  precodexattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Xcode.app /code/pre  <comment154376> Did you update xCode? <comment154377> Yes, I'd updated it from XCode v.5.0 to v.5.1. And v.5.1 was already running (I can say, some couple of weeks)! Then sudden this message appearing. <comment154379> Does it appear every time you close Xcode and subsequently reopen it? Or did it just occur this one time? <comment154380> You could consider removing XCode and perform a new install using the AppStore. Please post the results afterwards. During the update something might have caused this issue. Please try this first.
