Disable line wrapping and horizontal scrolling for output in iTerm <body> I want to disable the interactive line wrapping that iterm does in my terminal application.  I can run  precode$ python -c 'print "\x1b[?7l"' /code/pre  to disable line wrapping emon output/em, so long lines like  precode$ python -c 'print "asdf"*100' /code/pre  don't immediately get line wrapped and instead are cut off, but once I interactively change the window width to be smaller that line still wraps. I'd like behavior like vim has when in codeset nowrap/code mode - not even a flicker of a wrap.  This question is similar to Disable line wrapping for output in the Terminal, but that's asking about scrolling.  <answer144269> I believe this is not possible without using fullscreen mode - vim is using fullscreen mode (codepython -c 'print "\x1b[?1049h"'/code) which disables vertical scrolling as well, which isn't what I want (though this wasn't clear in the question).  Also, it turns out this behavior isn't specific to terminal.app - it's how all the terminals I've tried work.  <comment169837> Ah, I now believe this is only possible by using the terminal fullscreen mode, something like python -c 'print "\x1b[?1049h"'
