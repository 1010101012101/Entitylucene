Cannot find my phone on "Find My Iphone" <body> Someone stole my iphone 6s a few days back. It's locked with a passcode though.   I immediately accessed "find my iphone" to activate lost mode and play sound.   Later in the day, i tried entering the passcode on my icloud and it kept rejecting. I presume I must have forgotten it so I clicked for a reset.   Now I am in my iCloud and clicked on "find my iphone" but it says "No device found".   Though I can see my notes, contacts and my iphone 6s under settings.   What does this mean?  <comment289809> You will get a *No device found* message if the iPhone is turned off.  Maybe the battery died or it's been turned off?  Also, did you report this to Apple?  While not a duplicate, this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/128239/88313) might help.
