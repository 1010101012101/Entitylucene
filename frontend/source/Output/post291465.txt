Bootcamp Windows 10 says"You need to repair your PC" after partitioning Macintosh HD for linux installation.How do I solve this? <body> I had  Windows 10 on my MacBook Air 128 GB (Windows partition 35 GB). I decided to install Linux and added additional partitions (4 GB and 15 GB) for Live Mode with persistence, but as of now after installing Linux, entering Windows shows a blue screen with codeRecovery/Your PC needs to be repaired ,error code:0xc00000f/code.  I've tried making a Windows installer disk using bootcamp and repairing 'startup' under advanced settings turns out it cannot be repaired. How do I solve this?Or maybe there is a way i could install kali after windows again without corrupting the bootcamp partition? As, installing kali first would prevent me from installing windows through bootcamp as the install windows option gets grayed out due to inability of BCA to format the Macintosh HD into a single partition.  <comment368129> You should never create a partition less than 30GB.It will affect the partition table.
