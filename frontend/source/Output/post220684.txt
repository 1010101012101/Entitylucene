Change Folder Icon for Shared Dropbox Folder <body> I have several shared Dropbox folders. I would like to change the folder icon for each, to be a picture of the people with whom that folder is shared.  I know that I can change the icons for regular folders, so I tried to do that for the dropbox folders... which seemed to work at first. However, I notice that after a reboot, the folder icons reset to the default dropbox shared folder icon.  Is there a way that I can change the folder icons on a more permanent basis?  <answer220686> Dropbox likes to reset the images. You can prevent this by locking the new folder icon. After setting the folder icon to your desired icon, run the following command:  precodechflags uchg /path/to/folder/Icon$'\r' /code/pre  To unlock, replace codeuchg/code with codenouchg/code.  <comment267153> instead of preventing dropbox from changing the icon you should rather just change the icon which dropbox uses.  the icon should be located somehwere inside of the dropbox.app.  if you need more specific infos just ask - i'm currently on my phone so i can't get the exact path right now <comment267154> @konqui: I'm not sure that would work. I would like a different icon for each folder. Changing the global "shared folder icon" that dropbox uses would simply create a different icon used by all shared folders. What I'm looking for is a solution that lets me set different icons for different shared folders <comment267161> good Point i think i havn't thought all to end, sry what if you just choose a naming pattern for the folder like perhaps ProjectName_NameOfPeopleSharedWith or does the sharing change? <comment267162> @konqui: that's what I currently do. But I have far too many shared folders, so I don't want to have to read each name to figure out which folder I want (let's not forget that others may change folder names). Therefore, changing the folder icon would serve as a more permanent identifier, as well as on that's faster to sort through (I can process many more images than dirnames per second) <comment267166> ok then i guess changing icons is the option for you to go with - just keep in mind the icon of a folder on os x is really just a hidden icns File inside of the folder - i'm not shure what dropbox does with this file wther it is synced or excluded from beeing synced - it may be that your icon will be reset on every dropbox sync since the dropbox of the sharing-user changes it back to the default - i suggest you to test out what grgarside wrote with one folder to test if the icon stays <comment267379> Will this work if I delete the image file after I make the change? <comment267381> Also, what's the `'\r'` for? I didn't seem to need it <comment269178> I changed the folder icon for the dropbox folder, used `chflags`, and quit and restarted the dropbox application. The changed icon was replaced by dropbox's icon. This does not seem to work <comment336402> @konqui Really nice suggestion.
