ipad 3 screen cannot be lit <body> I have a ipad 3, which is sorta dead now. It still response to input, e.g. Siri will say something when I long press the home button. When connected to my mac, itune prompts me with a dialog. So it's not dead dead. But the screen never lit.   Is there a way to fix/workaround this?  Or, given that I've since bought a new ipad air 2, is there a way to backup everything from the old ipad without the screen? - I can't confirm a backup request from mac without the screen for now.
