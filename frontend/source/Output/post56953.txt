does command-option-click on app icon in dock still hide all open windows? <body> This apple article explains it.  But it no longer hides all open windows for me under 10.7.4. What could be causing this?  <answer56966> codeCommand-option-click/code does not hide all open windows. As stated in the linked Apple article, this command hides all emother/em open items leaving the clicked item visible. It is possible to hide all other items and minimize your most recently item with codecommand+option+h+m/code. This is a combination of codecommand+option+h/code - Hide Others and codecommand+option+m/code - Minimize.  <comment65399> I'm not sure that you understand the command.  Command-Option-Click on an app icon hides all open windows from apps other than the one you click on.  For the record, I have just tested that this still works.
