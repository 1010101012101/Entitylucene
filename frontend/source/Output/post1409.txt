Is there ANY way to edit, or at least view a MobileMe gallery on iPad? <body> So I have a MobileMe account.  (Yes, I know that there are free alternatives; my wife hates change.)  So I post galleries of photos on MobileMe, and then strongfrom a computer/strong I can either:  ul liLog in to my MobileMe account as the owner, where I can see my gallery, and edit it (delete photos, etc.)/li liGo to the public, shared, gallery url, which allows me to view or download pics, but not edit the gallery, just like the folks I share the link with can./li /ul  But strongfrom my iPad,/strong I can't really do either:  ul liIf I try to go to login to MobileMe (at me.com), the MobileMe site sees that I'm on a mobile device, and won't open, routing me instead to the app store to get the mobileme gallery app, which is for the iphone, and scales pictures in a totally ridiculous way on the ipad.  There is no option to open the "normal" full website./li liIf I try to go to the shared gallery url from my iPad, I can see the pics, but the thumbnails on the side use some kind of web tech that the iPad doesn't have, so I cant scroll.  I can only open the pics from the thumbnails that fit onto the ipad screen.  (Yes, I tried two finger scrolling.)/li /ul  Any ideas?  <answer1419> MobileMe Gallery App for iPhone, iPod, and iPad  <answer2936> MobileMe Gallery App is now an universal app.  <comment1267> This is the gallery app I referenced in the question- despite the name of the app, it is not a universal app, and the ipad version just scales up the iphone or runs in a tiny window. <comment6460> I, too have experienced these problems and am very disappointed with it. I have just purchased a year of subscription and am having serious doubts. The whole idea was to use a system that was universal. Now having paid over Â£600 for an iPad I find that I can't actually carry out the basics on MobileMe. I do hope someone can come up with an intelligent answer to our dilemma.
