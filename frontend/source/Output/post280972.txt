macOS update closed all my applications? <body> At exactly 4 a.m., macOS gave a popup saying, “Update Available,” then abruptly closed all my applications. I don’t remember receiving any earlier popups or warnings about updates being available.  strongIs this normal behaviour? Can I prevent it from happening again somehow?/strong  Having this happen at exactly 4 a.m. seems significant. Maybe it assumes I’m not active at that time?  <answer280973> You will normally be prompted to install updates as they are detected. However if you were away from your computer you may not see those notifications. Also if you delay them enough times they will eventually be installed for you. Lastly if the updates are detected overnight they may be installed right then as well. This is usually done sometime after 3 a.m.  You can go to strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongApp Store/strong and emuncheck/em the following:  ul liInstall app updates/li liInstall macOS updates/li liInstall system data files and security updates/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0JMsy.png" alt="Automatic Updates"  This will keep macOS from installing updates, quitting apps and/or restarting your system without asking you first.  You will still be notified when updates become available, and offered the choice to install them.
