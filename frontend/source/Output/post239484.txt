Does Apple provide a web site with content of `man` pages for the command-line commands bundled with Mac OS X? <body> I want to provide URL links to man page content at apple.com as an authoritative source of information. Describing and quoting the local man page is awkward.  Does Apple provide man pages on the web?  <answer239485> Yes, Apple provides these pages online, for example: https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ls.1.html for the strongls/strong command.  Source: Dr Drang   <comment293908> That link contains the word “legacy”, and addresses old version of Mac OS X. I could not find up-to-date editions of that site. <comment293913> Each release of OS X already contains local copies of manual pages for command line programs, so there is no need to point elsewhere and why Apple no longer maintains a set of pages for each release at their web site. <comment293919> My understanding from Dr Drang's post and the home page here (https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000894) is that Legacy does not mean refers to outdated OS X versions. What commands are you concerned will be out of date? <comment293926> I don't know what might be out of date -- that's the issue. The pages clearly say in large font at the top `This manual page is for Mac OS X version 10.9`. The very top bar on the page says “Retired Documents Library”. And “legacy” in the IT industry definitely is a euphemism for "out-dated, no longer recommended or applicable". So while this site may be better than nothing, it is certainly not good for current discussions. I do appreciate your posting, I just wish there were up-to-date and specific-version editions of the man pages on the web. <comment313466> You have no choice in this matter. Many of the Apple man pages do not keep up with the actual program options. What you will need to do is acquire the habit of running command -h|-help|something. defaults 'find' option and mdutil -'t' spring to mind as examples. There are many many more. Also, for some reason man pages get left out of man -k, i've had more success in hashing my path and grepping that.
