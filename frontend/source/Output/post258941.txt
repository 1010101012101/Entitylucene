Make Trash Folder with Proxy Icon appear in Finder Sidebar on El Capitan <body> If I drag the Trash folder (proxy) icon into the finder sidebar then it appears, but changes into the regular folder icon.  Is there a way to make it appear as the Trash (proxy) icon?  There is a solution to this problem for Lion: How can I add Trash icon to the sidebar in Mac OS X Lion? but though this does create a Trash folder, the trash proxy icon is changed.  Thanks!
