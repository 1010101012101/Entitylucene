How can I toggle network services with a script? <body> Currently I can do this only on a per connection basis using this script:  precodeproperty status : "none" property val : "none"  on get_status()     set status to do shell script "sudo networksetup -getnetworkserviceenabled Ethernet" as string end get_status  get_status()  if status is "Enabled" then     set val to "off" else     set val to "on" end if  do shell script "sudo networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Ethernet " &amp; val  get_status() display dialog "Status: " &amp; status with title "Network Toggle" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 /code/pre  But recently I am getting network from different sources and I would like to have a script with toggles availability for all active connections (either all on or all off).  Any idea on how I could pull this off?  <answer228627> Use the code-listallnetworkservices/code option to get all services.  codetail -n +2/code to delete the first line which contains strong"An asterisk (*) denotes that a network service is disabled."/strong  codesed 's/^*//'/code to delete the asterix character at beginning of each line  codewhile read thisName/code to loop  hr  The script:  precodeif get_status() is "Enabled" then     set val to "off" else     set val to "on" end if do shell script "networksetup -listallnetworkservices | tail -n +2 | sed 's/^*//' | while read thisName; do networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled  \"$thisName\" " &amp; val &amp; "; done" with administrator privileges display dialog "Status: " &amp; (get_status()) with title "Network Toggle" buttons {"OK"} default button 1  on get_status()     set status to do shell script "networksetup -getnetworkserviceenabled Ethernet" end get_status /code/pre  hr  strongsudo/strong in a codedo shell script/code command doesn't work on my system, I use codeadministrator privileges/code.  <comment278825> Thanks a lot!! I got rid of the dialogue, if I remember correctly, by adding networksetup to passwordless sudo on my system. So I don't have to write my password, when I want to avoid distractions :)
