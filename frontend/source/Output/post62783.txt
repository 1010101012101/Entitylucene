Are there external drive enclosures yet with a Thunderbolt interface? <body> I'd like to put some spare disks in enclosures and use the Thunderbolt interface. Does such a thing exist yet? I can't find any. Are there technical issues or licensing restrictions that have stopped this? My searches have turned up no general purpose enclosures and I find that surprising.  This seems like a ServerFault issue but I was sent packing here instead.  <answer62786> Taken from Apple.com     Promise Pegasus R4 and Pegasus R6,   LaCie Little Big Disk and 2big,   Seagate GoFlex Thunderbolt Adapter,   Elgato Thunderbolt SSD.   <answer64003> The new Drobo 5D and Drobo mini are both thunderbolt enabled, empty enclosures. Who knows when they'll ship though :/  <comment72482> Thanks but those already come with _drives_ (other than the proprietary Seagate adapter). I am looking for an **empty enclosure** into which I can put a drive that I already have. Something much simpler than a $1000 multi-drive RAID stack. <comment72486> I believe that the GoFlex adapters use SATA internally, so you may be able to use one as a generic TB -- SATA adapter.  Google "goflex bare sata" for examples of others trying this. <comment74039> I was looking for this a couple of days ago and found nothing other than an announced product with no market date. <comment74120> At $849 and $649, I don't think those are simple HD enclosures.
