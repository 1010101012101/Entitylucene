About 'Remote Login' how to logout that? <body> It's my first post and I'm not quite good in English. If I explained something not clear please let me know.  For simple when you logged in Terminal.app (on Mac OSX) the prompt should be  precode&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;path&gt; &lt;username&gt;$ /code/pre  My local hostname is "Macintosh" but now my hostname is "foobar.com"(don't need to publish this name is for example)  I had enable the Remote function and logged in to the "foobar.com" as my self, confused? So I mean I do all of this on my local.  ol liMy local hostname was Macintosh, I enabled System codePreferences&gt;Network&gt;Remote Login/code/li liI obtained foobar.com to log in./li liThen, I logged @foobar.com./li liMy hostname is foobar.com and my group is staff./li liI disabled PreferencesNetworkRemote Login /li liRestart My Mac./li liMy hostname is still foobar.com and still  :staff./li liSo, I need to logout to be myself :admin and hostname "Macintosh" Because I can't do anything as admin, It's weird./li /ol  How can I done that?  for additional information If I turn-off Wi-Fi that I      ssh logged in to myself  That is the result that I need.  <answer135353> To change the Local Host name   Open Sharing  Click on Edit under Computer name  codeComputers on your local network can access your computer at:/code xxxyyy.Local  Change name to your liking.  <answer135472> Some networks give name for your computer upon connected and you'll see this name in terminal application.   When you disconnect this network and open terminal again you'll see your favorite name.   <answer135473> Thanks all guys!  I just solved it by myself HeHe! I think is simple error that I don't know Terminal.app too much. The cause of problem is I command this  precodessh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;hostname_trough_remote_login&gt; /code/pre  and I didn't know how to logout, so It's just simple way to logout. use   precodeexit /code/pre  It's solved. (first I used codelogout/code)  <comment160549> I did but I think It doesn't work my local changed to "Macintosh" , but current logged user is staff that logged through remote, are you understand me what I say?
