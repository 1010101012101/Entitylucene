What is the ideal charging behavior for a new Retina MacBook Pro? <body> I've called Apple Support a bunch of times, but I got conflicting answers.  To my knowledge, new technology makes it okay to keep the charger plugged in non-stop, but I want to make sure I am properly caring the computer.  <answer141700> If you mean you may have to remove the charger when the battery is at 100%, even though (I don't actually know whether it does) mbp disallowed current input, i'd remove it anyway.  I hope I answered your question.  <comment166989> @GeorgeGarside Thanks. Do you happen to have any other documentation or references other than that post? <comment166993> I've seen no reputable source say removing the charger when it's 100% helps. The battery is already topped off and it won't matter much if you leave it then. <comment166996> don't leave your Mac plugged in for long periods at a time, say, over a week. The battery needs to exercise, and if it's plugged in for a really long time, it might "atrophy."
