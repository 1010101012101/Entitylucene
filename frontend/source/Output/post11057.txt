Is there an easy way to remove an app from itunes and all iOS devices? <body> We have 2 iphones and 2 ipads synched to itunes. It seems that to delete an app, I need to delete it from all devices individually and itunes - ie 5 deletes. Is there a better way to do this?  <answer11061> Not sure which iTunes version you have installed but as of 10.2, once I deleted an app from the app list in iTunes, the app is deleted from all iOS devices the next time they're connected and synced.  <comment13842> But when I synch the devices it comes up with "There are purchases on this iDevice - do you want to transfer them?" So I have to make sure I haven't downloaded anything directly and then click no. Kind of annoying.
