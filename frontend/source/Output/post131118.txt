How to change the color of text highlighting in Preview using a shortcut? <body> I need to highlight/underline a lot of text and tend to use specific colors for different things. Accessing via the dropdown menu in strongPreview/strong is very slow, does any one know a way to change the color of highlighting/underlining by pressing a shortcut?  I'm using Mavericks.  <answer131137> As you probably know the Preview does not have the short cut for that function.  Here is the list of shortcuts that Preview does has.  And many other OS applications shortcuts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fPtwC.png" alt="shortucts"  <comment153911> Does Command + T work for you to pop-up the font-menu?
