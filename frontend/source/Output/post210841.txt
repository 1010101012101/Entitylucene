How do I remove contacts on my sim card on iPhone? <body> By accident I imported some contacts to my contacts app in my iPhone. I do not need them there. So, If I need to avoid to import them again  by accident I would like to remove them from my sim. How can I do this?  <answer210847> iOS can't write to your SIM card, so you won't be able to do this on an iPhone. You have two options: find a friend with a phone that can write to SIM cards, install your SIM in their phone and erase it; or, just get a new SIM card from your carrier.  <comment254512> What is your iOS release ? <comment254514> iOS 9, iPhone 6S. <comment302759> It's SIM card is also a Nano type, so we can not place it in another phone and delete the contact. I don't know why they do not fix this bug!!
