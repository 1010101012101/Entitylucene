How does one access Team Foundation Server from an iDevice? <body> Sometimes I need to access a document from TFS on my iPhone/iPad (for example, in a meeting), but the web interface is so clunky, it's nearly impossible.  Specifically, I can't bring up any attachments.  Is there an iDevice client that has been known to work well?  I've seen 2 on the App Store but couldn't make either one work.  <comment83131> I assume TFS refers to Team Foundation Server. It's an unusual acronym around here so it might be good to edit and clarify that. <comment83295> @gabesubdo Thanks, edited.
