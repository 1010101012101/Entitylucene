My ntp server stopped working, how to troubleshoot? <body> I am running an NTP server on my MacBook Pro running Sierra 10.12.3 My MacBook Pro has two network interfaces, Wifi and a Thunderbolt Ethernet interface. The Thunderbolt interface is running the 192.168.2.0/24 network, the IP address of the Thunderbolt interface is 192.168.2.1.  I want clients to be able to query time from my MacBook Pro over the Thunderbolt interface.  This is what my /etc/ntp-restrict.conf file looks like:  precode# Access restrictions documented in ntp.conf(5) and # http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/AccessRestrictions # Limit network machines to time queries only  restrict default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer restrict -6 default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer  # localhost is unrestricted restrict 127.0.0.1 restrict -6 ::1  # thunderbolt connection restrict 192.168.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap nopeer  includefile /private/etc/ntp.conf includefile /private/etc/ntp_opendirectory.conf /code/pre  ntp.conf contains:  precodeserver time.apple.com /code/pre  ntp_opendirectory.conf contains nothing.  ntpq -np on the Mac gives me:  precode     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter ============================================================================== *17.253.34.253   .GPSs.           1 u   56   64  377   33.376   -2.540   1.462 /code/pre  One of the clients is a Ubuntu server. /etc/ntp.conf on this Ubuntu server looks like this:  precode# /etc/ntp.conf, configuration for ntpd; see ntp.conf(5) for help  driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift   # Enable this if you want statistics to be logged. #statsdir /var/log/ntpstats/  statistics loopstats peerstats clockstats filegen loopstats file loopstats type day enable filegen peerstats file peerstats type day enable filegen clockstats file clockstats type day enable  # Specify one or more NTP servers.  # Use servers from the NTP Pool Project.
