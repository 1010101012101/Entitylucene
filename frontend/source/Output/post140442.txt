How to edit /etc/profile using emacs? <body> I am using Emacs 24.3 on Mac OS X 10.9.4 and I am trying to edit code/etc/profile/code with that. It obviously does not work when starting the GUI version, but for some reason, it also does not work when starting it with codesudo/code from the command line. When I run  precodesudo emacs /etc/profile /code/pre  from the terminal, Emacs still complains that the file is in read-only mode and it cannot write it:  precodeBuffer is read-only: #&lt;buffer profile&gt; /code/pre  What am I doing wrong?  <answer140444> code/etc/profile/code is set to read-only for all users, so just using codesudo/code won't help.  What you can do:  ul lirun codesudo emacs /etc/profile/code/li litype codeC-x C-q/code to toggle readonly mode within Emacs/li liedit whatever you want/li litype codeC-x C-s/code to save it/li /ul  Alternatively you can run  precodeEDITOR=emacs sudo -e /etc/profile /code/pre  which automatically creates a temporary copy of the file you want to edit (which makes it a bit safer in case you want to cancel the update).  <comment165545> You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately.
