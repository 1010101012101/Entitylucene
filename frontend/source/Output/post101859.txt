What are the proper /etc/fstab options for mounting an NTFS drive ntfs-3g 2013.1.13 <body> I've installed the latest version of ntfs-3g and fuse4x available in the macports repos, and I can succesfully mount an NTFS partition with write access. However, I want to automate this in /etc/fstab. The only information I can find regarding /etc/fstab and ntfs-3g is for the old Tuxera version of ntfs-3g. Are there any updated instructions?
