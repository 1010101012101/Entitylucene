Move Photos App and data to external drive to make room on main drive <body> I am trying to make space on my Mac. It's overloaded and slow. I wanted to know if I can remove my photo application with all it's data and store it on an external drive? I understand that I couldn't access it if the external drive was not connected to my Mac.   Can I do this?   I have a MacBook Pro running Sierra (10.12.3).  <answer278482> All you have to do is emmove/em it.  ol liPlug in your external drive/li liCopy (click and drag) your Photos library from your internal drive to your external drive/li liWhen complete, hold down the Option key and launch Photos./li liIn Photos, select Photos  Preferences, and in the General tab, click Use as System Photo Library./li liOnce you have confirmed that the library is there and is working, delete your old library off your internal drive/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QDegZ.png" alt="enter image description here"
