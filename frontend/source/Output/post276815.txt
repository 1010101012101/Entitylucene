Printing to an Epson Stylus SX420W from macOS Sierra <body> I was out of ink, and borrowed my neighbours Epson Stylus SX420W (the box says SX425W, but it identifies as SX420W on my iMac), but I can't print to it, and don't find a suitable driver. The printer is a couple of years old and connects via USB.  According to this Apple support page the drivers for this printer model should be included with macOS Sierra.  When I open the Printers &amp; Scanners preferences, hit the + to add a new printer and select the Epson Stylus SX420W in the list, the dialog tells me the drivers for this printer model is emnot available/em from Apple. Which clearly contradicts the page above...  When I go to the Epson Europe support page for the printer, I find only drivers for the scanner part of the device. No printer driver.  Does anyone know ho to set up this printer correctly on an iMac running macOS Sierra?  emUpdate:/em I later returned the printer to my neighbour, and he helped me print my documents emfrom his MacBook Pro/em. He couldn't recall having installed any extra printer drivers, but as we were both in a hurry, we didn't investigate further. I believe he was running Yosemite or El Capitan.   (Sorry for the inaccurate language, my strikeOS X/strike macOS installation is in Norwegian)  <comment348466> I wonder if those drivers are an *optional* part of the install. EG try reinstalling the OS, click on the customize button and see if there is an option for additional printer drivers. Not sure tho, it's been a while... <comment348467> @SteveChambers Thanks! I'll give that a try. <comment348495> Just to clarify, can other computers print to this printer and only you can't? <comment348541> @fsb Yes, see my update above.
