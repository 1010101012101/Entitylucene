I'm locked out of machine as will not accept password as I shut down while using French keyboard <body> I cannot get into my Mac Book Pro, I just get the password picture which shakes.  The only different key for the password is a which is codeq/code on French keyboard but that doesn't unlock either.  I normally work with English keyboard but was using a French keyboard when the machine shut down.  Is there any sequence of keypresses to bypass the password so I can get into the machine?  <answer125522> Or you could change the password to something "keyboard language neutral" via single-user mode.

French ? <comment146866> There are other differences on a french keyboard. The main ones are: A and Q are inverted, so are Z and W.
