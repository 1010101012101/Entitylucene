Using a wireless printer with an iPad <body> Why my iPad cannot find the wireless printe? When I am using my laptop it is working fine because I installed the printer cd.How can I print when using my new iPad?  <answer75786> If your printer doesnt specifically support AirPlay try an app called Printopia.   http://www.ecamm.com/mac/printopia/  <comment87974> Which printer are you using? Are you sure it supports AirPrint? Have you tried the [AirPrint Setup and Troubleshooting](http://www.apple.com/support/ipad/assistant/airprint/) at Apple.com? <comment87975> Its an HP wireless printer <comment87977> Today's HP printers say that they support AirPrint.  Older ones, even wireless ones, don't.
