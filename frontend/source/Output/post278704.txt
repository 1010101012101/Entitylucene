MacBook Pro display problems <body> On my MacBook Pro (Late 2013, 13-inch, Retina display, Intel Iris 1536MB GPU), the display and/or GPU seems to be damaged:  There are colored vertical stripes, that seem to get worse on dark/black surfaces, when they are not regularily updated. There is a white bar on the upper side. And it seems that every second horizontal row of pixels in the Retina display is black (third picture).  It occured after I tried to clean the display with dishwashing liquid. I was also playing a game that causes a high load on the GPU, and crashed multiple times with a kernel panic.  Is this likely to be a problem with the display or with the GPU, and is there a way to repair it?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7aK3G.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hBB27.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tStWd.jpg" alt=""  <comment350767> This is a *physical* problem - time to take it in to be serviced.
