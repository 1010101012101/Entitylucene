Delete "Recently Deleted" album on iOS 8? <body> With iOS8, there was a new album called "Recently Deleted" in the Photos app. Is there any way to delete the "Recently Deleted" album or any way to disable this feature ?   I want the photos to get deleted as soon I delete them, I don't want to delete them twice. Jailbreak solutions are welcome too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nrnej.jpg" alt="screenshot"  <answer162086> If your device is jailbroken, you can install NoRecentlyDeleted, which does exactly what you would expect, making all photos be deleted immediately.
