Is there a way to see what activity iPhoto is doing with Flickr? <body> .Is there any way to see what activity is going on in iPhoto behind the scenes? Below is what I am seeing on OS X 10.8/iPhoto 11 (the arrows are spinning.)  I'm guessing iPhoto is updating Flickr or being updated by Flickr, I'd just like to know what is going on and I can't seem to find any "show status" option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1R3NZ.jpg" alt="iPhoto sidebar"  I'd like to be able to see is iPhoto is updating Flickr or if Flickr is updating iPhoto.  Something along the lines of...  ul liFlickr updated the keywords for photo xxx.jpg/li liFlickr updated the description for photo yyy.jpg/li liiPhoto uploaded photo zzz.jpg to Flickr/li liiPhoto set tags for photo zzz.jpg on Flickr to "Some tags"/li /ul  I suppose that would be the log of what is happening (not sure if that is explained well.)  Something inside of iPhoto would be nice but a third party app would be OK.  I tried the console app as was suggested with no luck (I could be missing something obvious) and I don't think snitch would know the details of what is being updated - I think it just shows network activity.  <comment116768> What are you trying to see? the communication, the actual data transfer, who is doing what ? the sync process ? Please elaborate. <comment116779> @Buscarì›ƒ - see my edit... <comment116782> Many ways to accomplish that. One is try your console to see who is doing what. Another would be to monitor your Traffic with something like Little Snitch. Write a script...
