Install Mountain Lion to another drive without rebooting <body> I'm wondering if its possible to install Mountain Lion to an external drive (connected via esata) without rebooting from the host system?  I came across this hint suggesting that it was possible to do with Snow Leopard, but this method doesnt work with ML.   <answer88352> Not really, but once you install a clean Mountain Lion system, you can image it to a DMG file and the clone it to your heart's content without rebooting the system doing the copying.  <comment103403> thats a shame, thanks for the quick answer!
