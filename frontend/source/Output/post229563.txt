How to enable dictation by voice on OS X? <body> I want to be able to say something like, "emStart Dictation/em," to turn on OS X's Dictation feature, instead of having to double-click the fn key.  In emSystem Preferences/em - emAccessibility/em - emDictation/em, there is an option to "emEnable the dictation keyword phrase/em." Here is a screenshot of this menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/91h4q.png" alt="Accessibility - Dictation Menu"  I have enabled this option and tried various phrases and the dictation has not been turned on once.  I'm not sure if this is related, but I have installed the "emEnhanced Dictation/em" data:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nhdy8.jpg" alt="&quot;Enhanced Dictation&quot; prompt"  Within the "emDictation Commands/em" menu, I have all "emSystem/em" commands enabled, including the "emStart Dictation/em" command.

Has anyone managed to Start Dictation by voice command?  sup(2013 rMBP) -- (OS X 10.11.3)/sup  <answer260878> Look at your first screenshot. Enable the dictation keyword phrase  To activate dictation by voice command, just speak the phrase "Computer Start Dictation"
