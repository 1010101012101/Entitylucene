/etc/hosts will not update/refresh at all <body> I add to my code/etc/hosts/code file this :  precode127.0.0.1 youtube.com /code/pre  Save the file. Flush everything with :  precodedscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  Reboot my computer 30 times.  Then I run:  precodedscacheutil -q host -a name youtube.com /code/pre  And I get :  precodename: youtube.com ip_address: 216.58.220.46 /code/pre  Clear my cache completely since the beginning of time in any browser, go to : codeyoutube.com/code, and I get codeyoutube.com/code, not my localhost.  I'm using OS X 10.10.5, Yosemite.  <answer208250> Check your hosts file, because probably it's malformed. It should look similar to this one:  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1       localhost 127.0.0.1       youtube.com 127.0.0.1       www.youtube.com 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost   /code/pre  Opening the file with codesudo nano /etc/hosts/code it should have a trailing empty line. All entries for 127.0.0.1 should be added above the broadcasthost. The space between IP-address and hostname should be one tab: kbd⇥/kbd.   After writing the file to disk with nano, the changes should take effect immediately (usually without executing any dnscacheutil or killall commands). Check this with codeping youtube.com/code.   Google Chrome is (probably) the only app which doesn't adhere properly (as a test in a VM revealed).  <answer248719> precodesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  No reboot required.  "It works!" for me, OS X 10.11.6  <comment251181> Is `/etc/hosts` still in use on OS X 10.10? <comment251183> @CousinCocaine It appears so, but and it seems like it works for other folks. Though I've read a handful of threads where folks seem to be having similar issues. <comment251185> I thought 10.10 moved away from /etc/hosts. Dont know the new way/mechanism of doing this. Not sure though. <comment251195> OOC, can I use the hosts file to make youtube.com alias to a different remote site? For example, going to youtube.com would be google.com ? <comment251196> @Trip Sure! That was the purpose of the hosts file in ancient days: ip-address-google.com tab youtube.com and www.youtube.com but only if the google-ip is different than the youtube-ip. In my case it isn't: both redirect to 216.58.213.46 <comment251202> Ah so it can only be redirected to a specific IP then and not a general address ( ie. bobmarley.com )? <comment251206> @Trip On the left side has to be an ip-address and on the right a hostname. <comment251207> Ah thanks so much good sir. You helped me so much. There's no trendy way to mask **just** a subdomain is there? <comment251208> @Trip I don't really understand your question. What do you want to achieve? Maybe you should ask a second question here. <comment251210> True. Only if you're interested! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32847606/can-i-alias-a-localhost-subdomain-to-a-remote-s3-host Thanks again so much!! <comment274964> First, dscacheutil and mDNSResponder doesn't affect /etc/hosts.  Secondly, watch out with https sites as they don't play nice with these tricks.  Additionally sites as facebook and youtube have a huge load of other hostnames.  Blocking them using /etc/hosts is next to impossible.  Better use something like Little Snitch if you really need to block those. <comment308275> From personnal use and `man hosts`: • There is not any rule requiring any empty line at th end of `/etc/hosts` file. • There is no mandatory order between entries. • The separator is any number of blanks or tab characters. <comment308276> The problem stands around the 30 times.
