Fusion Drive with missing partition <body> Initially my Fusion drive (1TB data disk + 240 GB SSD) consisted of a single partition where it was installed El Capitan, then I split the fusion drive into two partitions, the second partition I installed again El capitan ... All was well ... For a problem to the system keychain I wanted to move all the data in the second partition, I reset the first partition using disk utility that I returned an error not completing the process ... Now the second partition running 100% where startup El Capitan and the first partition does not exist, no longer visible! I tried to correct the error with disk utility but when I run SOS to repair the fusion drive, nothing happens ... will not start any operation by disk utilities .. terminal with diskutil cs list:  precodeLuca:~ geminimac$ diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 9B6BD63D-4451-4324-AB99-0855D82312C1     =========================================================     Name:         Fusion Drive     Status:       Online     Size:         628372754432 B (628.4 GB)     Free Space:   621867577344 B (621.9 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume F3B0E961-E842-4ED3-AF12-452551D913FA     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     388659318784 B (388.7 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 10C75CA7-7AE0-42EF-B6A5-4077F457A629         ----------------------------------------------------         Index:    1         Disk:     disk1s2         Status:   Online         Size:     239713435648 B (239.7 GB)  /code/pre  I also have a FreeSpace of 621.9 GB which is the first partition lost.
