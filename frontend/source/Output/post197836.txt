Force netaccounts network device list to show up at loginwindow <body> Is there a flag within codecom.apple.loginwindow/code or somewhere else where I can force the network dropdown list above username and password to appear (even without WiFi being on or an ethernet device being plugged in)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3xhf.jpg" alt="OS X Login Window with network device dropdown list/menu"  I've tried a lot of codecom.apple.loginwindow/code codeplist/code modifications, and codedseditgroup/code changes including: codedseditgroup -o delete -T group com.apple.access_loginwindow/code, codedseditgroup -o edit -n /Local/Default -a netaccounts -t group com.apple.access_loginwindow 2&gt;/dev/null/code,  code/usr/sbin/dseditgroup -o edit -n /Local/Default -a localaccounts -t group com.apple.access_loginwindow/code  code/usr/sbin/dseditgroup -o edit -n /Local/Default -a com.apple.loginwindow.netaccounts -t group com.apple.access_loginwindow/code  codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow Hide500Users -bool NO/code  codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow AdminHostInfo DSStatus/code  and many others, without any impact on forcing the network device dropdown list to appear.  We're currently using a mobileconfig profile for Cisco ISE 802.1x authentication, and we're able to get it to pop up every time if we include a WiFi loginwindow profile, but if WiFi is turned off the dropdown doesn't display. The ethernet device only displays in the dropdown if the user has already logged in and logged out; no dropdown menu persists upon a reboot it's no longer there. The only way to get it to show up after a reboot was to include a WiFi profile and ensure WiFi adapter was on. Is there any way to bypass/force this behavior? I'd like it to show up all the time, no matter the circumstance.
