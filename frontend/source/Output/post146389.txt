In Terminal, how to erase typed command quickly? <body> In Terminal, let's say I type a long command, but before I press Enter, I decide that actually I don't want to run this command, and want to run another new command instead.  In such case, how to quickly remove everything I have typed, so that I can start typing the new command?  Pressing Delete for a few long seconds is not a good solution, I am looking for something faster.  <answer146390> You can cancel current command with kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdc/kbd. You can clear command to the beginning with kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdu/kbd. To clear line after the cursor press kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdK/kbd.  Here are some great answers on StackOverflow.  <answer146391> You can just use kbdcmd/kbd +kbd . /kbd to stop and go to a new command prompt on a new line.  It will not erase what you typed. But more importantly it will not execute it.  <answer146392> Terminal natively supports basic Emacs key mappings. As such:  Press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbda/kbd to move the cursor to the beginning of the line and then kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdk/kbd to delete to the end of line.  <comment172493> The crt + u one is a good one to know. crtl + k does not work. The only similar one I know to that is cmd+k which clears all visible history from the window. <comment172494> @markhunte if you are in the middle of the command line you are editing, ctrl-k will delete from the cursor to the end of the line <comment172495> "crtl + k does not work." It definitely works for OS X default key mappings. It deletes everything after the cursor. "ctrl+a" takes the cursor to the beginning of the line. <comment172497> @patrix , Ah I get you. I was at the end of the line. so had nothing to clear. Doh.. Good tips here.
