Witch and Youtube Fullscreen Windows <body> I just installed Witch for one reason only which is that if I make a youtube video fullscreen in Chrome then kbd⌘tab/kbd to another app, when I kbd⌘tab/kbd again to get back to the youtube video OSX instead just switches to the browser in the current space.  Unfortunately when I tried Witch it lets me switch back to the youtube video but the codeyoutube.com is now full screen/code prompt appears strongAND NEVER DISAPPEARS/strong.  How can I fix this?  <answer239404> It turns out Chrome is apparently creating some special window called "Window". Witch sees that as the previous window and kbd⌘tab/kbd switched to it, not the actual video window. This takes me to the correct space for the video but it's the wrong window.  The solution is to tell Witch to ignore windows with the name "Window" by adding code,Window/code the the "Ignore windows with titles:" Behavior settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8D8MQ.png" alt="add ,Window"
