Sharing a Printer from Maverick to Tiger <body> I currently have a Teacher using a newer i5 iMac running Maverick, and am trying to share the usb connected printer (HP1300) with 4 student G3 iMacs running Tiger.  I have the printer shared (from the Teacher iMac), but it's available to me as an option to add to any of the Student iMacs.  Everyone is on the same network, and oddly enough another teacher iMac (Which is still at Lion) shows an available printerâ€¦  So what has changed between Lion &amp; Maverick as far as printer sharing is concerned?  <comment177515> Share the Shared? hmm, not sure that is possible.
