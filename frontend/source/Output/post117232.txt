Add audio and video codec to iTunes <body> I have a dream... One day my iTunes could read also MKV and all other codecs that are not natively supporter by it...  Is there a solution for make this reality? I have codeffmpeg/code tool installed in my mac, and also lots of codecs.  Can I "install" one of this codec in my iTunes and make it read also MKV?  <answer117238> The answer to this question used to be "install Perian", and although that still works and provides many great codecs for Quicktime (and therefore iTunes), it's discontinued.  Give it a go, it's always worked really well for me.  <comment137001> Is "no" a sufficient answer? :) <comment137007> Maybe more custom solution? like some injection in iTunes code? :D
