Mac App Store Download does not start on fresh installed Lion <body> I needed to reinstall Mac OS X, so my plan was to format the drive, install OS X Lion (since I have the USB stick here) and then update to Mavericks. Sounds simple, yet I have a problem: The Mavericks download does not start! I logged into the App Store and clicked on Load, and it says that the download is in progress.  But: Nothing happens. I do not get a progress bar in the Purchased Menu and the Icon in Launchpad only says it is Loading but the progress bar there does not change. strongI tried another already purchased app and it did not work either!/strong  I deleted everything in the App Store download folder - no success  <answer115946> Try resetting the Mac App Store.  ol liEnable the debug menu and restart the Mac App Store.  precodedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre/li liChoose the strongReset Application/strong option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/73M8S.png" height="356" alt="App Store Debug Menu"/li /ol
