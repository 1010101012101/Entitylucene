Disable Scrolling on Magic Mouse 2 in El Capitan <body> How can scrolling (horizontal or vertical) be disabled in El Capitan with a Magic Mouse 2?    Accessibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  Mouse Options does not contain a checkbox as described in some online articles  <comment312388> I would also like an answer to this... the terminal commands; `defaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchMouse MouseHorizontalScroll -bool NO`. `defaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchMouse MouseVerticalScroll -bool NO` or `defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseVerticalScroll -bool NO` `defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseHorizontalScroll -bool NO` do not seem to work
