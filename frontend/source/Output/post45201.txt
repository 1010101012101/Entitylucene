Boot Camp missing Coprocessor, SMBus Controller Drivers <body> I installed Windows 7 on a user's Macbook Pro yesterday (Aug 2010 model I believe) using Boot Camp, then I used the Mac OS X disc to run the Boot Camp Drivers installation.  I then restarted as normal and went about the myriad other installs, when I entered devices and noticed the "!" symbol on the computer.    Lo and behold, 3 drivers were missing: Coprocessor, SMBus, and a third that I can't recall at the moment.  I found several references to the missing Coprocessor and SMBus online, but the posted solutions (to install nVidia drivers, to run the Intel Update service, to let Windows 7 try to find the drivers itself) all failed (some of the driver installations reported the incorrect hardware, some installed but didn't resolve the missing drivers in Devmgmt).      I've installed Windows 7 on 10+ Macbook Pros and never once run into missing drivers after installing the boot camp driver pack.  Everything seems to be working fine: display, ethernet and wireless, sound, track pad, eject button all function perfectly, but the ! in Device Manager are driving me crazy.  Any ideas?  <comment51473> have you tried repairing or reinstalling with the install discs? <comment328081> I haven't them yet but there's some solutions on here http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/coprocessor-and-sm-bus-controller-drivers-for-windows-7-32bit-issue.634282/
