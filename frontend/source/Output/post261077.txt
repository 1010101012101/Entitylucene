Why does my iPhone speak certain emoji in a Japanese accent? <body> My language settings are only set to English, but my iPhone speaks certain emoji (like ‍♂️ and ‍♂️) in a Japanese accent when I select them in a message and tap emSpeak/em. Can anyone explain? Here's a visual example of what I see when I select mixed words and emoi:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mdL3n.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment328148> Are you sure there is no place in your settings, such as Dictionaries or Keyboards, where you have Japanese, Chinese, and Korean listed?  For some reason it is offering you all those languages in the popup menu. <comment328176> @TomGewecke Just double-checked; I'm positive. This happens on some of my friends' iPhones, too. <comment328188> Are those "certain" emoji from someplace other than Apple? <comment328189> @TomGewecke That's the Gboard keyboard, but it's the same if I use the built-in keyboard.
