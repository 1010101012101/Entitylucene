Check the battery level of connected bluetooth headphones from the command line <body> I am trying to check the battery level of my wireless headphones from the command line.  I came across a few discussions, and it seems all I need to do is enter the following:  codeioreg -c 'deviceName' |grep -i batterypercent/code  I tried this command using "Powerbeats Wireless" and "bluetoothaudiod" for the code'deviceName'/code's, but neither returned the codebatterypercent/code. I tried codeioreg -c bluetoothaudiod |grep -i battery/code to get general information about the battery, and get this as a response:  precode| |   +-o AppleSmartBatteryManager  &lt;class AppleSmartBatteryManager, id 0x100000250, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 7&gt; | |     +-o AppleSmartBattery  &lt;class AppleSmartBattery, id 0x100000252, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 6&gt; /code/pre  If I connect the headphones to my strongiPhone/strong, the battery level emimmediately/em pops up on the toolbar.  This leads me to believe that the device is broadcasting battery level, and that I should be able to access this information from my computer.  How can I check the battery level of my bluetooth connected headphones?  strongEdit:/strong   Initially I thought the issue was with the device name, but it seems code"Powerbeats Wireless"/code and codebluetoothaudiod/code work interchangeably.  Just can't figure out how to access the codebatterypercent/code param.  strongEdit 2:/strong   Looking at the Bluetooth docs, it seems there's a strongBattery Service/strong which exposes the strongBattery State/strong and strongBattery Level/strong.  The Battery Level can be read using the strongemGATT/strong Read Characteristic Value sub-procedure/em, so I need to figure out a way of interfacing with this service from the command line. I have a feeling codebatterypercent/code may only be coded for standard peripherals (trackpad, mouse, keyboard), as all battery monitoring widgets I've tried are only compatible with such devices.  strongEdit 3:/strong  Revisiting this almost a year later.  I know have a wireless trackpad &amp; keyboard, and can see their battery levels perfectly fine ( in both the toolbar or the command line). Still unable to get the battery level from my headphones though, and not sure why :/  <answer249279> You need to use codeioreg/code. You'll need to know the name of the device. Just follow this guide.  The guide, in short, basically has you run the codeioreg -c &lt;devicename&gt; |grep '"BatteryPercent" ='/code  Example:  precodeioreg -c BeatsBluetoothHeadset |grep '"BatteryPercent" =' /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PgBU2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Additionally, you could retrieve broader battery information with:  precodeioreg -c BeatsBluetoothHeadset |grep Battery /code/pre  <answer293811> On my iMac(macOS 10.12.6), none of solutions mentioned above works. After reading the man page of strongioreg/strong. The solution that works on my computer is:  precode// the -r option is used to reduce output // the -l option is used to display properties for all object // by default some object properties are not shown // the -c specify device class, the class could be specific or general ioreg -c AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService -r -l ioreg -c AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService -r -l | grep -i battery  // instead of using device io class, you could also use a property key to query // you need to know one of target device's property key(-k), for example it is BatteryPercent for Bluetooth keyboard and mouse // any device with this property will be listed ioreg -r -l -k "BatteryPercent" ioreg -r -l -k "BatteryPercent" | grep -i battery /code/pre  There are some other device classes to try for the -c argument: strongAppleHSBluetoothDevice/strong  strongAppleHSBluetoothHIDDriver/strong strongAppleMultitouchMouseHIDEventDriver/strong strongAppleHIDKeyboardEventDriverV2/strong, they give different output.  <comment259996> `ioreg -c "Powerbeats Wireless" |grep -i battery` also returns the general battery info, so i think i have the correct device name.  But why is the `batterylevel` command not working !! Smh <comment259998> Please edit your question instead of commenting on your own question. <comment260000> @IronCraftMan edits are now complete.  You think you could offer any help? <comment280291> Hi - I'm interested in hearing if you got any further.  I want to get the battery life out of PS4 controllers connected by BlueTooth to my iMac. <comment309162> So if a guide includes ALL of the steps required, you'd prefer I recreate those steps and add them on here? <comment309164> Ah. That makes sense. I'll modify my answer, and follow your instructions from here on out. Thank you for the tips! ;) <comment309168> haha. I just update my answer. Does that look better? <comment309169> Now that's a well written answer! <comment309170> @Allan Thank you! :) <comment309335> @Allan Thanks for the vote up!!! <comment309654> Hey, thanks for your response! This problem seems to be specific to the Beats headphones, as I can access battery levels for my wireless keyboard & trackpad.  Will update the original question! <comment352598> Doesn't work for my JVC bluetooth headphones either. Strange, because my 5-year-old iPhone 4S has no problem telling me their battery level when connected. <comment360240> it's not working for me
