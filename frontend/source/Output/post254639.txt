Will reinstalling OS from recovery mode preserve iTunes library? <body> I have a Macbook Pro with a broken OS (computer was turned off during an  update and won’t boot any more).  The Macbook contains some user data that hasn’t been backed up in a while, including a valuable iTunes library.  Will those data be preserved when reinstalling OS X (Yosemite) from recovery mode, or is there an easy way to get hold of it again?  <answer254641> Yes, it should. The last time I restored an OS (El Capitan) the user data was preserved, but I would definitely recommend booting from recovery then trying to back up before restoring. Once you make the changes, if something breaks then it's too late unless you have a backup. Consider Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! to facilitate.   <answer254642> As long as you don't explicitly erase then you should be okay. You can also use target disk mode or something else to try and make a quick backup before moving forward.  <answer254672> Reinstalling OS X or macOS from Recovery mode or an Installer will not delete any files.
