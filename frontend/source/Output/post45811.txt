Can I use iMovie to edit a .mov file without altering the aspect ratio? <body> I created a screencast using Snapz Pro X that gets saved in .mov format (H.264, AAC). I want to just cut a few seconds off the end of that file. The only video editor I know of that's installed on my Lion machine is iMovie '11. Can I use iMovie to remove part of the end of the video, but maintain the same dimensions (1146x1057)?   I tried to import the movie, create a project with just the parts I wanted, and then export via "Share - Export Movie", but this:  ul limakes the resolution worse/li lialters the aspect ratio/li liincreases the file size/li /ul  <answer45824> Open the video file in Quicktime player and then go edit  Trim or command + T and you can trim the video in the editor.   Save the video and you're good to go.
