Where is my 'Wallet' app (ios8.4) <body> This may be a UK problem, Apple pay was launched in the UK today and it coincided with an update to ios8.4.  But I still have Passbook.. Is there a way of turning on wallet or has it simply not been launched in the UK yet?  <answer193880> strongThe Wallet app/strong is coming with codeiOS 9/code, and is not yet supported in codeiOS 8.4/code.  I've tested iOS 9 in Germany, and it will be supported in every country. They 'just' changed the name (and introduce a collective place for Apple Pay in the future).  Source  <answer193964> 'Wallet' is an ios9 feature. It will be available in the fall   <answer193966> Apple Pay will be launched in the UK "in July" and has not yet been released. The Passbook app becomes Wallet with the release of iOS9 in the autumn.  <comment231180> So will I be able to use Apple pay on 8.4 (maybe through passbook)? or will I have to upgrade to the ios9 beta to use apple pay? <comment231214> Well, Apple Pay is depending on your country. Since it's not supported in Germany yet I have no idea how this will work. But you can use Apple Pay with Passbook, of course. I think you can store your MasterCard etc. there. <comment231288> The Region setting is the one that enables/disabled the Credit Card part of Passbook (Wallet in iOS9) - so if you are in eg. Germany, you can change the Region to eg. US, and you get it.
