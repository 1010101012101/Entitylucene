Change finder thumbnails size <body> In previous Mac OS versions (&lt;10.9) I was able to change the images' thumbnails in the finder by zooming or unzooming with the trackpad. Now that I run on Mavericks, I can't find a way to do it. Does anyone know a trick for that ?   <answer138501> In any folder or window (including Desktop) simply press :  kbdCMD/kbd+kbdJ/kbd  <answer138540> If the Status Bar is showing (View  Show Status Bar), then you can use the slider in the bottom-right corner to adjust the thumbnail zoom. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e1Ifg.png" alt="status bar zoom slider"  <comment163418> Do you mean you want to change them or do you want to change them via the trackpad ? <comment163483> @YoshiBotX I'd like to change them via the trackpad
