How to make bin + cue image of audio CD under macOS <body> I want to make a bin and cue files of my audio cd. On Windows I use PowerISO but on macOS I don't know how to do it.  <comment371511> Are you looking for something like `mkcue` or `bchunk` which are easily installed with brew.sh framework? https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/179113/5472 <comment371512> For now Iâ€™ll close as dupe of a question pointing to XLD. Any edit to the body of the question will review the hold. <comment371538> Yes thanks mkcue and dd did the job.
