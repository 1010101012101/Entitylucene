The Impossible Quiz right-click doesn't work <body> In The Impossible Quiz, Question #40 has you place your cursor on one button and then has you move the cursor to another button about an inch away without hitting any of the area in between. The solution, which needs the cursor to not be detectable to the game while in a right-click menu, hasn't been working in the last couple versions of OS X. (I know definitely Mavericks and Yosemite, and I know that at some point before then it did work, but I don't have an exact version when it stopped working.)  This is what the solution should be, courtesy of a random YouTuber.  This is what happens when I try to do it.  How can I make this work again?  <comment195752> could you post a screen shot of it! <comment195753> Sure. Just let me play through to that part of the game again... <comment195754> @Buscarì›ƒ I added two quick videos (0:28 and 0:15) to show what should happen and what happens to me. <comment195756> Thank you for the videos, saves me playing the whole game :) <comment195759> I do not know the reason, I see he is on Flash 14 and you are on 16? he also does not select anything in the Flash pop up, just moves fast across.
