Running a .jar on a Mac <body> I've recently been wishing I could still play a strongMinigolf/strong game that came installed with my first cell phone, a Sony Ericsson T610 (eat your heart out, iPhone!), which roughly looked like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ULnGA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  supem'Member?/em/sup  There are good reasons to believe that the game is "abandonware" and that Sony Ericsson doesn't offer support for it anymore.  I think the game can be found as a .jar file online, and is either this one or this one.   However, after downloading these files, I haven't been able to run them. strongJava/strong is installed in the strong/Library/strong folder of the strongMacintosh HD/strong drive, and when I right-click the file to open it, I get a em"The Java JAR file “Real_Minigolf_2005_128x128_SE_K300i-448093.jar” could not be launched. Check the Console for possible error messages."/em error message.  I have looked into this answer and this one, but neither have worked.  strongIs it possible to run these files on a Mac running El Capitan or above?/strong  <answer283884> In general, you run a ‘runnable JAR’ by opening it or with Terminal codejava -jar /path/to/game.jar/code.  However, this JAR does not contain a suitable manifest for launching, i.e. not a runnable JAR.  precode$ java -jar /path/to/game.jar   no main manifest attribute, in /path/to/game.jar /code/pre  Therefore you have to specify the main class manually. However, that still doesn't work.  precode$ java -cp /path/to/game.jar E Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/microedition/lcdui/Graphics […] Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics […] /code/pre  That's because this JAR doesn't support being run on a computer. It's a game for a mobile device and you can't launch it on a computer.  <comment358011> Thanks for the answer! Any way to run it within another frame, like as a part of an emulated OS?
