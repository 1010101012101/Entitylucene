What happened to my option-arrow key? <body> I use a Microsoft Natural keyboard with a Mac Mini.  Yesterday I found that Option-leftarrow (which normally moves the cursor by one word) no longer worked.  All other arrow functions, including Command-leftarrow (move to left margin), were unaffected.  It occurred to me that perhaps the stroke had somehow been reassigned to a function that in most contexts is meaningless.  So I opened System Preferences / Keyboard to look around, and saw that F14/F15 are assigned to screen brightness; was a bit surprised at that, as my keyboard has no F14/F15.  But where F14 would be is a “PrtScrn/SysRq” key, and I noticed that it was down.  I released it and Option-leftarrow works again.  What's going on here?  What does “PrtScrn/SysRq” do?  (What key does MacOS think it is?)  <comment354400> It might be related to the system preferences keyboard shorcut bug for services no idea. <comment354506> When I posted this, two of my favorite Firefox extensions (Character Palette and Identify Characters) had gone dormant, though purportedly they remained active; now they're back, and I can write “⌥←”.  Maybe I have gremlins. <comment354510> There are bugs in macOS/OSX.  What version are you using? <comment354512> @William: 10.12.4, which I believe is current.
