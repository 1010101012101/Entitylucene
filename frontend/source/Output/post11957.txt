MySQL - Ruby on Rails mysql gem not working on snow leopard <body> i have installed codemysql 5.5.11/code and i'm running on Snow Leopard (10.6.7)  when i create my rails application everything wokrs fine:  coderails fooTest -d mysql/code  then   codecd fooTest/code  then  coderake db:create/code  and i get:     Couldn't create database for   {"reconnect"=false,   "encoding"="utf8",   "username"="root",   "adapter"="mysql",   "database"="fooTest_development",   "pool"=5, "password"=nil,   "socket"="/tmp/mysql.sock"}, charset:   utf8, collation: utf8_unicode_ci (if   you set the charset manually, make   sure you have a matching collation)   <answer12011> This looks like a permissions problem.  Make sure you have a password set in your mysql and are able to login from the command line  precodemysql -u root -p /code/pre  This should prompt you for your root password.  If you can login there, that means you should be set.  All you need to do then is put the password in your database.yml file and retry the rake command.  <answer48603> Try using the gem mysql2 in RoR. I had the same problem as well.  <comment12512> Post your database.yml (hide or obfusicate your password line, and maybe also your host line!). I suspect something else is at play here. <comment12955> Had to do some things with the MySQL root user password encryption `UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=OLD_PASSWORD('NewPassword') WHERE User='root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
