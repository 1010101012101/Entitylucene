What is the LED in Audio port for? <body> I recently attempted to install Ubuntu on may codeLate 2013 13" Mac Book Pro with Retina Display/code.  Under Linux I noticed a strongRed/strong LED light inside the audio port. It looks like Ubuntu doesn't know how to handle it and activated it.  I have absolutely no idea what is that for, but I would really like to know.  Also is there any way to control it? : )  <answer127228> It is part of the the digital audio out built into that port. You can plug in a toslink cable instead of a 1/8th inch analog cable to get digital audio from your Mac Book. (via)  emmight not work in Ubuntu/em  <comment149083> Nice! I didn't knew I had an optical audio output.
