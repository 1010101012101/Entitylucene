Finder: show video thumbnail for all kind of formats/containers <body> I wish that Finder show video thumbnail for all kind of formats and containers. *.flv doesn't get a preview, some *.mp4 not, *.mov not.  Is this possible? Maybe a video browser in place of Finder? I have Perian installed.  <answer74760> Flash Video Viewer added thumbnails for flv files and Flip4Mac for wmv files.  I didn't find any way to add support for mkv or other formats. VLC, MPlayerX, Movist, and NicePlayer don't come with Quick Look plugins.  <comment86982> howto install that Flash Video Viewer? <comment87032> Since you already have Perian, just download the zip, move flv.qlgenerator to /Library/QuickLook/, and log out and back in. <comment138957> Can you give some more specifics on your Mac OS? For example, what version do you use?
