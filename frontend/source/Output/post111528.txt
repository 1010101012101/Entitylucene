How to disconnect iPhone from WIFI without 'forgetting' it? <body> My internet connection died whilst my router still continued to work (so I could still pick up wifi but had no internet connection). I wanted to tether my laptop to my phone so I could use 4G instead, but my phone was still connected to the shody WIFI.  I couldnt just turn off the WIFI on my phone as then my laptop would not be able to tether. I didnt want to 'forget' my WIFI connection as I do not know the password.  Is there anyway to simply disconnect from a WIFI signal?  <answer111530> So I'm assuming you're tethering your laptop to your phone via wifi from some app? Can you just turn wifi off, then go to the tethering app and enable tethering? If wifi is off I imagine it should turn it on and switch to it's tethering mode.  Also, a note: The phone should stay connected to the cellular network while wifi is on.  <answer111537> You could use Bluetooth or USB to tether your connection to the laptop. That would allow to deactivate wifi and let the iPhone connect to cellular.  <answer143080> You don't actually have to turn off Wifi.  Here's what I do when my cable modem drops:  ol liSettings  Personal Hotspop - turn to on/li lion my laptop, click the WIFI icon in the tray to open the "Currently Connected to" Dialog.  /li liSometimes at this point I have to use the refresh Icon in the top right of that dialog a few times to get my iPhone's SSID to show up, sometimes turning the personal hotspot on/off on the phone is what works.  This is the tricky step but if you play with it, the phones SSID will show up in the laptop./li liConnect to the SSID for the phone when it appears.  The phone will drop it's connection to the router and start tethering the laptop.  /li /ol  When your ready to return, just turn off the personal hotspot on the phone and the phone will re-join the routers network.
