The wifi on my iPhone 4S suddenly couldn't detect any networks. How can I troubleshoot this? <body> I just realized that my wifi doesn't work anymore. I couldn't remember upgrading, installing, or updating anything in the last few days, and I don't think I dropped the phone or anything like that.  Is there any way to diagnose/troubleshoot this to find out what's causing the problem and fix it?  I've tried powering off and restarting the phone multiple times, but the wifi still won't work.  <comment228305> Is the Airplane mode ON ? <comment228306> Buscar: Airplane mode is OFF. I can use Cellular Data / 3G and Bluetooth perfectly fine. It's really just the wifi that's the problem. <comment228335> Have you tested at more than one previously working location, just to eliminate a single router as source of the problem? <comment228336> Tetsujin: Yup, I've tested it on my home network, office network, and with a mobile wifi hotspot and none of those networks are detected. <comment228466> I had wifi stop working after an iOS update once many many versions ago.  The genius at the genius bar hadn't every seen anything like it before.  He noted that Settings  General  About showed the "WiFi Address" as 00:00:00:00:00:00 instead of a valid address, but had no fix for that, so the device (which was basically brand new at the time) was replaced.
