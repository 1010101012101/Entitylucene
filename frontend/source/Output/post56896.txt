How to group Adobe CS5 application tabs in one window (like the Windows version)? <body> On Windows (7) my Adobe products have all their tabs and tab groups in the same window.  On Mac (OS X Lion) my Adobe products have all their tabs and tab groups separated floated every which way.   Is there a way on the Mac to group all these tabs like on the Windows machine?  See the different windows flung about the desktop:  img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8161/7609559970_fd3592c9a7_b.jpg"  I am using Adobe CS5.  Apparently I am not the only one complaining about this:  http://blogs.adobe.com/dreamweaver/2010/04/dreamweaver_cs5_help_now_avail.html  <answer59301> I only have CS6, and, in that version, I'd make sure Window  Application Frame was checked. This moves everything (documents, palettes, etc.) into one window frame like the Windows version.  <answer60080> You should be able to check "Application Frame" in Dreamweaver as well... At least you can in CS6, I don't have CS5 installed anywhere any more. But for a more in depth look into how to style dreamweaver's layouts check out this help page from Adobe, it's pretty straight forward.   You may also find that changing to one of the other preset work spaces suits you better. It should be something like Window  Workspace layout. You can create your own custom layouts, but you'll probably find one that suits you from the myriad of presets.  <answer169428> For CS5, go to the "Window" tabs and scroll down to and click on "Application Frame". Everything should group into a window.  <comment68318> Cool, half way there. `Use Application Frame` works great in Fireworks. Any solution for Dreamweaver CS5+? <comment68319> Apparently I am not the only one complaining about this:  http://blogs.adobe.com/dreamweaver/2010/04/dreamweaver_cs5_help_now_avail.html - I think I may be upgrading my Coda and making the switch permanent. <comment68320> I probably launched Dreamweaver CS6 once just to make sure the install worked. I use mainly Photoshop and Illustrator, and I only have Photoshop on my work computer; the rest are at home. <comment69174> I guess you can't do that in Dreamweaver CS5. I'm partial to having everything in separate windows myself: I have a question around here frantically asking how to turn the Application Frame *off* in Photoshop CS6. <comment199017> I have since scrapped adobe's bloatware for more specific task oriented products.
