iMac 27-inch 5k late 2015 RAM upgrade <body> I have bought recently an iMac 27-inch 5k late 2015 which came with two 4gb slots of RAM. I'm thinking to buy two slots of 8gb of RAM.  My question is:   Is it good to have them mixed like 2 slots of 4gb and two with 8gb? Can this cause any damage? Or can this be incompatible? Does it affect the performance in the sense that by having four slots of 4gb of ram can perform better?   What do you think?   Thank you!  <comment348398> No it won't cause damage. Whether or not the computer will want to start like that I don't know. Some Macs are ok with mixed RAM (source: experience on some MBPs), but some are not (source: experience on Xserve). I would suggest doing this: buy the replacement ram and do a full replacement (remove original ram and add new sticks). Then boot it and make sure everything works well. Then, if you want to try to use the old ram as well, shut down the imac, add the new sticks, and try to boot again. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, you haven't broken anything, but you have your answer.
