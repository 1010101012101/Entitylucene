Using mdfind to evaluate the text content of a specified file? <body> I would like write an applescript to evaluate whether a particular file contains a specified string (perhaps as part of an if... then statement). I want to invoke a shell command using mdfind to do this and I am aware of how to restrict mdfind to find files containing a specified string only in specified directories:  precodemdfind -onlyin /Users/viktor/Desktop/ nintendo /code/pre  This command will find all files containing the string "nintendo". Is it possible to somehow query a file rather than a directory? And return true / false or the file itself to indicate that the string is in the text content of the file? Putting a file name after "-onlyin" does not work of course...   <answer88737> Try:  precodeset fileText to read POSIX file "/Users/John/Desktop/test.txt" as «class utf8» fileText contains "nintendo" /code/pre  <answer88740> You could also just use grep:  precodegrep -qFi nintendo file.txt &amp;&amp; echo found /code/pre  -q = quiet, -F = fixed strings (disable regex), -i = case-insensitive.  This would search recursively (-r) and list the names of matching files (-l):  precodegrep -rlFi nintendo ~/Notes /code/pre  You can also restrict mdfind to specific metadata attributes, but it doesn't really help in this case:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemTextContent="*nintendo*"i' -onlyin ~/Notes/ /code/pre
