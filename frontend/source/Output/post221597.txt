OS X El Capitan: man, command not found <body> Today I was trying to update openssl in my MacBook Pro with El Capitan 10.11.2. I don't know where I made a mistake but it seems I have accidentally disabled man. In fact, if I launch codeman &lt;something&gt;/code or codeman man/code or simply codeman/code it says -- code-bash: man: command not found/code. Is there a way to restore it?  Some commands:  codewhich man/code -- nothing  codefile /usr/bin/man/code -- man is a directory  I am afraid there's not an executable anymore. In fact, with codels -al /usr/bin/man/code I got  precodetotal 0 drwxr-xr-x     6 root  wheel    204 30 Dic 18:15 . drwxr-xr-x  1063 root  wheel  36142 30 Dic 20:51 .. drwxr-xr-x    46 root  wheel   1564 30 Dic 18:15 man1 drwxr-xr-x  1025 root  wheel  34850 30 Dic 18:15 man3 drwxr-xr-x     4 root  wheel    136 30 Dic 18:15 man5 drwxr-xr-x     3 root  wheel    102 30 Dic 18:15 man7 /code/pre  <answer221603> This is only the barest bones of an answer. But maybe someone wiser can fill in the rest of the picture.  Apple publish the source for the open source parts of OSX. So the source for "man" is retrievable from http://www.opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-10112/.  However if you download and open that file, code./configure/code runs okay in the man folder, but codemake/code fails with codemanpath.c:31:10: fatal error: 'xcselect.h' file not found/code.  'xcselect.h' seems to be something that Apple don't share.  <comment268348> Try `which man` and `file /usr/bin/man` and update your question. :) <comment268349> Ok, I have just added the command outputs <comment268350> Okay I'm curious now. Run `ls -al /usr/bin/man` and update your question. <comment268351> done...I'm really afraid I deleted the bin :( <comment268354> With the other issues you had today it might be time to consider restoring from a Time Machine backup or a clean install of OS X. <comment268355> I don't have a time machine :( <comment268359> Clean install! The man dir including man1, man3... usually is here: /usr/share/man <comment268368> That's probably for the best. And don't be so hard on yourself. Only way I seem to be able to learn is by making lots of mistak... experiments. And believe me I've made lots and lots and lots of mistak... experiments, in my time. :) <comment268370> You're right but this, in my opinion, is a terrible mistake and I am supposed to be a "computer scientist"...anyway, thank you for your help. And have a good 2016!! :)
