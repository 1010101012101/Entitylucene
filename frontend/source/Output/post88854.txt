How can I get iMessage to verify my phone number? <body> iMessage won't verify my phone number. When I try to select my number for messages to be sent, it's greyed out. So I receive my iMessages over email which I don't want to do.   I've tried: turning iMessage on and off, resetting network settings, rebooting my phone and nothing's worked.   Any ideas?   <answer89160> Looks like you tried all the basic troubleshooting steps.  Heres the next step:  ol liMake sure your data is backed up, either iTunes or iCloud./li liTurn iMessage off (make sure to do this)./li liErase all contents and settings (this will wipe your device.)   codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Erase All Contents and Settings/code./li liSet the phone up as New (make sure to do this)/li liTurn on iMessage, wait for it to activate.  Once it's activated erase the phone again and restore from your backup./li /ol  <answer91819> You need to sign in to iCloud on your iPhone before it can receive messages via iMessage. After you do that, you can even receive iMessages sent to your email address if you register the address with your Apple ID.   <answer104044> This was an easy fix for me:  ul liBackup on iCloud if you feel like you need to/li liTurn off your iMessage/li liGo and delete all your network settings/li liLet the phone restart/li liTurn on the iMessage again, wait for 10 seconds or so/li /ul  <answer145858> With iOS 8, you can toggle iMessage off and on.  <comment107857> What happens when you turn iMessage on on your iPhone? What does it display in text below the iMessage on-off control?  Where exactly are you "trying to select your number for messages" and finding it greyed out? <comment122547> This seems similar to what the OP says they tried and didn't work? Also more/less same as first answers?
