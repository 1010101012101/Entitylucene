How to restore Spotlight user interface after killing it with Cocktail? <body> I installed an App called cocktail and disabled spotlight. But now the Application does not start and it gives an error of some sort. I deleted the App and I do not have Spotlight anymore.  Can I enable it from some other place? How?  pastebin.com/Yw8czsFU  <answer167125> precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  Once running this, wait for Spotlight index to update.  <answer167126> try     codesudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search/code   then     codekillall SystemUIServer/code   <answer167127> Have you checked the status of spotlight on the boot volume?  precodemdutil -s / /code/pre  If enabled, maybe you need to purge and rebuild. Just Try  precodesudo mdutil -Ei off / /code/pre  This will disable Spotlight on the boot volume and delete the index. Then  precodesudo mdutil -i on / /code/pre  This will re-enable Spotlight on the boot volume and create a new index.  Tail your log file to look for errors. For complete details, read the mdutil man page (codeman mdutil/code).  Hope this helps  <answer167134> I removed coctail and installed again, then enabled spotlight.  <answer185908> The easiest thing to do is go back to Cocktail  System  Spotlight  Uncheck "Hide menu bar icon".  <comment195924> and how did you disable the Spotlight? <comment195925> "an error of some sort" … knowing the error would help. Also, knowing whether it disabled indexing or just the UI <comment195929> I am getting: /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist: Operation already in progress The software only disabled the UI I guess <comment195930> @Buscar웃 There was a menu item in the application I mentioned. <comment195931> @Tetsujin I deleted the app so I do not know the error anymore. It only disabled the UI. CMD + Space does not work either. <comment195934> Cocktail will only run if you have the correct version for the OS. Mavericks was v7, Yosemite is v8. It can disable UI &/or indexing, so we're not certain which you did, though after grgarside's answer it looks like UI <comment195935> ah, don't think that works in Yosemite. get the latest version of Cocktail instead & use that ;) <comment195936> Please add within the OQ the output of the following command: `/usr/bin/sudo launchctl list`. This will help correct analysis. <comment195941> @Buscar웃 It says operation already in progress. <comment195942> @danielAzuelos Here: http://pastebin.com/Yw8czsFU <comment195943> Clarify, do you see the spotlight in the menu bar,  do you have Spotlight in the system preferences? can you open it from there? <comment195944> @Buscar웃 No, it is removed from the Menubar. The Magnifier icon is lost. CMD + Space does not work either. In System Preferences I see icon for Spotlight but it only opens preferences for Spotlight, not the search bar itself. <comment195946> go here and get it /System/Library/CoreServices/Spotlight.app <comment195947> @Buscar웃 It says: -bash: /System/Library/CoreServices/Spotlight.app: is a directory <comment195948> @Buscar웃 When I try from Finder it says: The application “Spotlight.app” can’t be opened. <comment195950> thought that might turn out to be easiest ;) <comment195951> so now we will never know how that happened :( <comment195956> @Buscar웃 You can always install Cocktail, disable spotlight and remove Cocktail :) Thanks for your help. <comment195957> or just disable it & check logs, see what it did <comment195958> If you would like to make this question an interesting one, I would suggest to: • uninstall Cocktail, • check that Spotlight UI is OK, • install Cocktail, • deactivate the Spotlight UI, • note and write here the "error message" you get. <comment195962> Please put the useful details requested within the original question. The comments fate is the trash.
