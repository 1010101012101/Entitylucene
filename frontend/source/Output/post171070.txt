How can I jailbreak 8.1.3 <body> Is it possible to jailbreak the 64 bit iPad Air 2 with 8.1.3?  <answer171076> Not currently. You can read about how 8.1.3 has patched the loopholes required to jailbreak 8.1.2 and 8.1.1 on jailbreak nation's web site:  ul liVersion 8.1.3 patches the exploits used in TaiG and PP Ghost causing a permanent loss in jailbreaking until another exploit is found (which can easily take months)./li /ul  I'm sure someone will update things if another exploit is possible, but unless you can revert to 8.1.2 you might be out of luck indefinitely.    <comment201488> Well... http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/171077/how-can-i-un-update-my-ipad
