An exhaustive list of all graphics cards by all vendors ever put on mac? <body> Where can I get an exhaustive list of all graphics cards ever put in a mac? Or at least in the last 10years...   I am NOT interested in mobile devices, just desktops and laptops.  <answer160222> Mactracker.app  Has a list going back all the way to the beginning.  <answer161348> So just for ease, as of this moment the most complete list that I've found thanks to Tetsujin's comment is found in http://www.everymac.com/ultimate-mac-sort/?sort=all-intel-macs under the Graphics Card tab. This is a list of all cards in intel based macs (G3):  3D Rage II+embr  AMD FirePro D300 x2/embr  AMD FirePro D300/D500 x2*br  AMD FirePro D500 x2*br  ATI PCI*br  GeForce 320Mbr  GeForce 6600br  GeForce 6600 LEbr  GeForce 7300 GTbr  GeForce 7300GTbr  GeForce 8600M GTbr  GeForce 8800 GSbr  GeForce 9400Mbr  GeForce 9400M*br  GeForce 9600M GT*br  GeForce FX 5200 Ultrabr  GeForce FX Go5200br  GeForce GT 120br  GeForce GT 130br  GeForce GT 330M*br  GeForce GT 650Mbr  GeForce GT 650M*br  GeForce GT 750Mbr  GeForce GT 750M*br  GeForce GT 755Mbr  GeForce GTX 660Mbr  GeForce GTX 675MXbr  GeForce GTX 775Mbr  GeForce2 MXbr  GeForce2 MX TwinViewbr  GeForce2 MX*br  GeForce4 420 Gobr  GeForce4 440 Gobr  GeForce4 MXbr  GeForce4 MX*br  HD Graphics 3000br  HD Graphics 4000br  HD Graphics 5000br  Intel GMA 950br  Intel GMA X3100br  Iris 5100br  Iris Pro 5200br  Mobility Radeonbr  Mobility Radeon 7500br  Mobility Radeon 9000br  Mobility Radeon 9200br  Mobility Radeon 9550br  Mobility Radeon 9600br  Mobility Radeon 9700br  Radeon 7500br  Radeon 7500*br  Radeon 9000 Probr  Radeon 9000 Pro*br  Radeon 9200br  Radeon 9600br  Radeon 9600 Probr  Radeon 9600 XTbr  Radeon 9650br  Radeon HD 2400 XTbr  Radeon HD 2600 PRObr  Radeon HD 2600 XTbr  Radeon HD 4670br  Radeon HD 4850br  Radeon HD 5670br  Radeon HD 5750br  Radeon HD 5770br  Radeon HD 6490M*br  Radeon HD 6630Mbr  Radeon HD 6750Mbr  Radeon HD 6750M*br  Radeon HD 6770Mbr  Radeon HD 6770M*br  Radeon HD 6970Mbr  Radeon X1300br  Radeon X1600br  Radeon X600 Probr  Radeon X600 XTbr  Rage 128br  Rage 128 GLbr  Rage 128 Probr  Rage 128 Pro*br  Rage 128 Ultrabr  Rage 128 VR 2D/3Dbr  Rage 128*br  Rage IIc*br  Rage LTbr  Rage Mobilitybr  Rage Mobility 128br  Rage Probr  Rage Pro LTbr  Rage Pro Turbobr  <comment188363> Carefull. With Mactracker won't get a list of all graphics cards, you will get a list of all macs. But, you have to navigate model by model to see what's the card in a given model. <comment188367> I figured the OP could see that its not a list and would have to navigate. <comment188377> http://www.everymac.com has all the data - just not laid out for easy accessâ€¦ though you can search by almost every other conceivable parameter <comment188400> Yes, definitely not gonna work in my case as it will take me forever but +1 cause it is quite useful anyway and I didn't know it... <comment188497> @Tetsujin Oh, I think that might do the job!
