Use Apple Wireless Keyboard for PC and Mac <body> I need a wireless keyboard and mouse that I can switch between my MacBook Pro and PC.  I was looking at the Apple Wireless Keyboard, but I'm not sure if I can change from PC to Mac usage easily enough.  Does anyone have a similar setup?  <answer30117> The Bluetooth Apple Wireless Keyboard is able to be connected and used with a Win PC as long as the Win PC supports bluetooth.  <answer30121> As per Bluetooth functionality, one would have to pair/unpair with the chosen device to switch to another system. It's worth noting that Apple by no means supports PC's to work with their accessories, and a quick search will show you plenty of people having a less-than-stellar experience trying to make it work. A more appropriate long-term solution is a wired keyboard and a KVM to switch between systems.  <comment34572> what does it take to switch between the two? How easy is it? <comment34777> If both Mac and Win PC are turned on, you need to pair and unpaid the bluetooth keyboard (or turn on/off the bluetooth on the Mac or PC).  Otherwise, as @David said, a wired keyboard with a KVM is better choice.
