How can I open application's windows on dock separately like Windows 7? <body> I'm new to OS X.  If I open multiple Excel workbooks, how can I see each workbook opened separately on the dock?  Any help?  <answer277316> Pretty sure this isn't possible as I don't see a way in settings, here are some workarounds:  ol liMinimized windows will show up in dock if "minimize windows into application icon" isn't checked in dock preferences (right click on dock to pull them up)./li liIf all windows are not minimized you can swipe up with three fingers to show all windows. You can also cycle through windows by pressing kbdcommand/kbd + kbd`/kbd/li liRight click the excel icon in dock to display all open workbooks./li /ol  <answer277333> Native methods closest to what you want are:  ul liRight clicking Dock icon, as mentioned by @JBallin  ul liThat will show a context list, which will include the titles of the open windows for that application/li /ul/li liThere's also the mission control feature that will show all open windows for the currently active application. You can find the shortcut in: codeSystem Preferences &gt; Mission Control/code and there codeApplication windows/code. I'm fairly sure you can set touch gestures for this as well. You should find that in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Trackpad/code/li /ul  hr  hr  If the native methods don't work for you, there's always the option to use third party applications.  There's a 3rd party Dock replacement called stronguBar/strong ($20). There's a trial available.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HfrDt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ul liYou can stop some applications from showing up in the dock, which is not very doable off the box with the native Dock./li liHas window previews and option to group application windows (kinda like in Windows)./li liOrdering options: codeManual/code, codeAlphabetical/code, codeLaunch/code subsupI love the manual order. I can make sure that when I open adobe applications, for example, they always open next to each other at the top of my uBar./sup/sub/li liYou'll likely want to hide native Dock. You can find terminal commands for that in here. It just hides it so that you are never likely to accidentally show it. You need the second to last terminal command. You can still easily toggle the native Dock open via the shortcut codeCmd+Alt+D/code. The reason why I occasionally have the need to show the native dock is to assign which space I want an application to go to, which you do by right-clicking an icon in the dock and choosing: codeOptions &gt; Assing To:/code(at the bottom of the list). This is not a feature in uBar, so.../li /ul     Note that uBar has quite a few customization options, but I'd say it has two distinct styles. First style is very Windows Taskbar like, as shown in that picture above. The second style is closer to the modern Dock look:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ckews.png" alt="enter image description here"   hr  hr  Another alternative or addition could be strongHyperSwitch/strong (free beta). supsubI use both of these 3rd party applications./sub/sup  ul liIt has option to show previews of windows when using codecmd+tab/code  ul liIt works by either codecmd+tab/code:ing or hovering over the icon with a mouse. You can choose which window to open by navigating with arrow keys or of course clicking with mouse./li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/elbly.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul/li liIt also has it's own alternative application switcher which can show each application window, instead the application icon, which is more like the windows application switcher. It can also be made to show only application windows in the current space, which is super useful for people who use spaces a lot./li /ul  <comment349070> Thank,  Currently I use the 3 options as you suggest plus full screen 4 finger swipe, but this is not what I want. It is not because I used to the Windows but because it does not make my work easy. is there an external app? <comment349093> Thank you! I like uBar has hover preview option. <comment349097> uBar also has ungroup window option. The most wanted feature i need. Awesome!!! <comment349098> @praHoc Great :)
