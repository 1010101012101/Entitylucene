Thumbnails for old photos are wrong in Photos app <body> I imported a large number of old photos into iPhoto, and I then updated to the new Photos app recently. After the update, the thumbnails on the old photos are incorrect. They are just thumbnails of different pictures.  I cannot find a way to fix this. I tried launching Photos with CMD and Option held down and allowing the repair to complete. The problem persisted.  I have added an image that shows a thumbnail that doesn't match the selected photo. Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGhaP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer192823> Try changing the shape of the thumbnails.  There is an option "Display Square Thumbnails in Split view" under the View menu option. I can't be sure, but this may cause the app to redraw the thumbnails, and may resolve your problem (lets hope so anyway).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AryVl.png" alt="View menu"  <answer192942> Simply rotate all your photo's to the right using kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdR/kbd and then to the left using kbd⌘/kbd+kbdR/kbd. This could take some time, but it isn't as hard as exporting and importing the whole library.  <answer192970> From the discussion forums at Apple:     Are you still able to use iPhoto on your iPhoto Library?  If so run the first aid on that library with iPhoto and apply Options #1, Repair Library Permissions, #2 - Rebuild Thumbnails and #4 - Rebuild Library Database.       Then open that "fixed" library with Photos to create a new Photos library.  See if that will bring the thumbnails back.   <answer192994> h2To Rebuild the Photos.app Thumbnails:/h2  Backup your library before following these instructions.  strongemDelete the old thumbnails and various parts from the library:/em/strong  Quit the Photos app.  Open Finder, and go to the Photos.app Library, on my system it is called codePhotos Library/code and is found in the codePictures/code folder.  Now right click the library and click codeShow Package Contents/code.  Next delete the folders called codePreviews/code and codeThumbnails/code.  Then delete the files called codeImageProxies.apdb/code, codeImageProxies.apdb-wal/code, codeLibrary.apdb/code and codeLibrary.apdb-wal/code from the codedatabase/code folder.  Lastly delete the folders codeRKCloudResource/code, codeRKImageProxyState/code, codeRKMaster/code and codeRKVersion/code from the coderecovery/code folder.  strongemNow rebuild the library/em/strong  Open the Photos app strongwhile/strong pressing kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd. It will ask you to if you want to repair the library, click codeRepair/code. It will do a repair, then your photos will go through a reprocess/reimport process. Once finished the thumbnails will start rebuilding.  P.S. I tried this on my own Photos library, and it worked.  <comment226871> Does removing and adding again the pictures work? <comment226873> How do I remove and add the picture again? Export the pictures to another location and then re-add them? I guess I'll try it for one, but that is a large task for my library size as a fix for all the pictures. <comment226877> That did work. I would still like a better resolution than exporting, deleting, and then reimporting my entire 100 GB library. <comment226879> If it works, make a copy of your photo library, delete everything —via the Photos app— add everything back. Be careful because if you upgraded from iPhoto the library is probably split in two: everything you had before the upgrade inside the old iPhoto library; symlinks pointing to the old library and photos after the upgrade on the new Photos app library. <comment226880> Sorry, I was writing while you commented; I agree it would be better to have a way to recreate the thumbnail db. <comment226903> I tried moving the Thumbnails folder out of the Photos Library package; it recreated the folder but it didn't recreate the thumbnails. The "Moment sized" thumbnail is a blank square throughout my whole Photo library now. <comment226994> I wonder if I paired moving the Thumbnails folder out of the library with the library "repair" process if they would get recreated. I will try that tonight when I get home. <comment229602> Tried. No luck. Thanks though <comment229819> This isn't a reasonable solution for 30,000 photos. <comment229937> Is there a source where you got the list of things to delete? I'm a little nervous about deleting so many internal files of the library. How long did the thumbnail rebuild take? <comment230221> Zach you should do a backup first! <comment230253> @Zach Green, not really. I did a bit of research to write this answer, so there's a lot of links. I'd backup your library first, if you can't do that then don't try this solution. :) It did not take long for my library, but it only has about 300 photos because I use Capture One for my photos by default. Also I use SSD.
