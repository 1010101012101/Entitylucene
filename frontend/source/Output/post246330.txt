locat hostname is already in use on this network? <body> When I turned my computer on this morning this is the message I received:  precodeThis computer's local hostname "----Macbook-pro.local" is already in use on this network. The name has been changed to "------Macbook-Pro-2.local" To change the local hostname, open system preferences and click sharing, then click "edit" and type the name in the local hostname field. /code/pre  This is very concerning to me since I can't think of any reason this should happen. I do not understand any of the answers I have read while do a search. I have not done anything complicated nor do I have a WiFi along with an Ethernet connection - only a WiFi connection.  I only have one router as well and I always connect to same network. The things I have done differently are:  ul liI have added a printer and have also downloaded emWhatsapp/em but have not used it yet./li liI opened Skype last night and have not done that in a while so maybe that could be the reason?/li /ul  This is very concerning to me since I can't think of any reason this should happen unless it has something to do with what I said above. I am not comfortable changing settings that I really do not understand. I also felt as if I have been hacked or whatever it is called when someone takes over your computer. As I said, I am not an expert by any means and this is worrisome to me.  Can anyone please help and explain it in a way that I might understand what has happened. Thanks! Kind regards!!  <answer246332> You won't easily get hacked. Your router has a firewall which blocks all ports, unless you opened them and routing them to your internal IP address. You also have have to enable these features in your Sharing Preferences to work like File Sharing (port 21 for FTP), Remote Login (port 22 for SSH/SFTP) and a Web Server (port 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS). These are all unticked by default.  strongWhat you can do to secure yourself/strong  ol liUntick all the options in Sharing: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iSx4h.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liMake sure you have a difficult password on all your accounts./li liEnable your Firewall in System Preferences - Security &amp; Privacy - Firewall/li liRemove any Dynamic DNS services (like DynDNS) from your router (if you don't use it) that links your IP address to an actual address eg. myhouse.homelinux.com that would go to your IP address even if you get 100 new ones every day./li liIf you removed the dynamic DNS service, restart your router to obtain a new IP address just to be sure that no one has your new IP./li liCheck all the devices on your network, ban any unrecognized device's MAC address. /li liChange your router password from admin/admin to something more difficult and your WiFi password. Combinations of numbers, upper &amp; lowercase letters and special characters./li /ol  If you would like to know who this is, you can open the Terminal app, then type: codeping ----Macbook-pro.local/code, here it will display the device's IP address and time in ms if the device responds.  ol liIf it gives you an IP address, you can look up this IP address in your router at DHCP to block the device's MAC address./li liIf you don't see an IP address, it is dead and you can change your hostname back to what it was./li /ol  Hope this helps, if anyone wants to add/change something, feel free. :)  <comment303729> Do you have access to your router and it's DHCP and/or DNS client page?  Also, do you have it connected with both Ethernet **and** WiFi? <comment303731> If your Mac is reporting another machine with the same name and there is a malicious actor involved, he is long past your firewall for your firewall to have any effect. <comment303740> My bad....I am responding to a bunch of stuff this evening.
