Can I block ads on a (jailbroken) iPad? <body> I am about to buy an iPad, and was using a friend's device recently.  I noticed all these multi-colour intrusive square things I'm completely unused to seeing because I've been using Adblock Plus for years now.  I care enough about not seeing ads to jailbreak a device for it.   What are my options?  <answer3354> No need for a jailbroken iPad, iCab can block ads http://www.icab.de/mobile.html And it is a great browser.  <answer3355> One option is to use a different web browser, such as iCab, available from the App Store.  If you really want to use mobile Safari, the following method has been reported to work properly for a jailbroken iPhone or iPod Touch, and should work on a jailbroken iPad:  http://lifehacker.com/5060621/block-ads-on-your-jailbroken-iphone-or-ipod-touch  There exists an app in the Cydia store called AdBlock that aims to fulfill this purpose, but many have found it to be nonfunctional.  <comment3035> iCab also will mirror what you are viewing on an external display if you use the VGA adapter!
