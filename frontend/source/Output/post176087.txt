Accessing Apple Hardware Tool on MacBook Air 2010 running Yosemite <body> I charged my MacBook Air (Late 2010) up to 100% charge overnight however my battery died within 1 hour. Because of this I want to use the Apple Hardware Tool (AHT) to diagnose the issue.  My Mac is 4 years old and holds up to 70%-75% of its original capacity (6,700mAh).  I have tried holding the kbdD/kbd key when booting my computer however it boots up normally.  How would I accesses the AHT?  <answer176088> Your AHT feature will have been lost when you upgraded to Yosemite.  You can restore it by inserting the strongApplications Install/strong disc that was supplied with your computer and typing the following command, putting in the actual name of the disc where indicated...  precodesudo cp -R /Volumes/[name of disc]/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics /System/Library/CoreServices /code/pre  You will of course be able to run the diagnostics directly from the install disc.  ul liActually read the question properly and of course your Air doesn't have an optical drive - did it come with any re-installation media? If not you now know where the actual test file should go, if anyone can supply you with the required file/li /ul  <answer176238> Here you find an extensive list with various links to AHT images.  The direct links to the AHT of your model are: 13" MacBookAir3,2 or 11" MacBookAir3,1.  To copy the .diagnostics folder, mount the dmg  and enter for the MacBookAir3,2 AHT:  precodesudo cp -R /Volumes/AHTBOne/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics /System/Library/CoreServices /code/pre  or for the MacBookAir3,1 AHT:  precodesudo cp -R /Volumes/AHTBTwo/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics /System/Library/CoreServices /code/pre  and enter an admin password at the prompt.  After copying the folder successfully try again to boot to Diagnostic Mode.  <comment207794> No, I don't have the disk. I think (but I'm not sure) I still have a Mavericks install application on my external hard drive. Could I use the AHT using that? <comment207799> I've checked and your Air should have come supplied with a USB software installer - not sure about the Mavericks installer, I will check shortly but I doubt it will have the appropriate AHT build for your Mac. <comment207801> If you're looking to download the AHT for your Air the specific one you need is AHT build 3s142. <comment207804> Thanks. Do you know where I can get it? I don't have the installation media since I got it second hand. <comment207806> Start with Google and search for **Apple 3s142** - there is a chance I have a copy at home as I'm a magpie for such things (you never know when these things will come in handy), will check when I finish work. <comment207929> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/21820/discussion-between-scunnerdarkly-and-apydeveloper). <comment211498> Thank you for your reply. I have not tried this yet since my Mac is working normally again. I shall mark it as answered since it looks like it should work and it will mark this question as answered.
