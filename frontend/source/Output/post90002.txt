How do I show content of hidden password boxes? <body> About 1 year ago, I set up FTP access on a webserver that's being used for our client. The project temporarily stopped and is just resuming now. I need to set up the same FTP access on another computer. I already forgot the password we used for it before and I can't seem to locate the email detailing the server info. Our server admin is currently unreachable so I have to come up with a solution myself.  I am looking for a tool similar to this one, but for OS X 10.6.8.  If it helps any, the FTP client I used is Transmit.  <answer90006> I just solved my question. As it turns out, the password is stored in the Keychain Access. I just searched for the server and ticked the "Show password" checkbox on that particular item. Problem solved!
