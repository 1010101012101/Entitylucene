Python IDLE can't be opened by double-clicking .py files in Finder <body> I can't open code.py/code files in IDLE by double-clicking them in Finder (IDLE is currently set as the default program for opening such files).  Nor can I open those files by right-clicking and selecting IDLE.  If IDLE is already open I can open code.py/code files through the codeFile &gt; Open/code method.  Once IDLE is open I can also just double-click code.py/code files and they will open in IDLE.  Finally, in the Terminal, I can open code.py/code files just fine by typing codeidle -e file.py/code even if IDLE has not yet been opened.  I just can't open IDLE itself by double-clicking on code.py/code files, or by right-clicking on code.py/code files and selecting IDLE.  I'm using OSX 10.8.2 and Python/IDLE 2.7.3.  Anyone know how I can fix this?  <answer85331> ol liYou don't need to install python 2.7.3 on ML since it's default./li liIf you really need custom installation of python (if you need special site packages for example), you need to install it from mac ports or from home brew (I do prefer mac ports). And rule custom packages from that location. /li liTo make IDLE runnable from your python installation you have to resolve all dependencies such as TKinter. /li /ol  <comment97724> `env PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin idle file.py` works for me, I can't check your version since I have not installed Tkinter for my Python3.3 I use. Have you installed other python than default? <comment98047> @EirNym, I had Python 2.7.3 and Python 2.6 (from python.org) installed on my machine, and then I uninstalled both and re-installed OSX and XCode.  Then I reinstalled Python 2.7.3 (again from python.org).  In which file are you setting the path in your comment? <comment98331> As IDLE is a GUI it won't look at any change in your path in .profile files - does the Apple IDLE work? <comment99586> I'm really confused.  When I installed ML, the default version of Python I got (when I typed "python" at the command line) was 2.7.2, not 2.7.3.  Also I wasn't aware that IDLE came pre-installed on ML.  Based on your answer, I'm no longer sure how to tell the ML pre-installed Python/IDLE versions from the python.org ones. <comment99691> You can freely to remove python from python.org and install from MacPorts if you need different python to setup site packages
