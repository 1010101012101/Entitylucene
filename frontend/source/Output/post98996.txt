How can I send a multi part mime email from my mac <body> How can I send a multi part mime email from my mac for the purposes of sending a html email together with a plain text version. The emails I send will be going out to a single recipient each time.  <answer99004> Mail.app sends a multipart mime email with hrml and plain text alternatives if you select Format-make Rich text  <comment116323> Can you clarify how you would send the mail if it weren't multi-part mime (ie, would you send it via a shell script, php, etc) ? <comment116328> No, it's rich text not HTML <comment116329> No it is HTML - send a mail to yourself and then look at the raw source. The original NeXT Mail.app used HTML but OSX changed it to HTML but left the menu option as is <comment116331> OK, let's clarify. Mail.app sends HTML but a user cannot edit an HTML email. You cannot include links, you cannot use HTML tags. You have some very limited formatting options that are then sent as HTML. <comment116347> @Kent, I would use Apple Mail <comment116426> You can add a link when writing a mail message.  Highlight the word(s) you want linked, control-click (right-click), and follow the "Link-" context menu.  Add the URL.
