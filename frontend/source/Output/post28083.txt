How can I add an action to search for the selected Terminal text in Google? <body> I want to be able to add an action to search Google with any selected text in Terminal. Any ideas?  <answer28086> You could use the one that's built into iTerm2 â€¦ (which is a viable replacement for Terminal anyway, if you don't know it yet)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cggG4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer28244> You can enable the corresponding service in Preferences/Keyboard.  Default key assignment is kbdShift-Command-L/kbd which I had to change because it was already used by something else.  After enabling the service you can initiate a Google search in Terminal by selecting a text and  ul lipress the shortcut key/li liselect the service in the context menu (Services/Search with Google)/li /ul  Only drawback is that the search always opens Safari even if you have different default browser.  <comment32221> Yeah, thanks I just downloaded it! <comment33140> This doesn't seem to work with highlighted text in terminal <comment33156> It definitively does for me: highlight/select text, right click, Services. <comment35230> Do you want the Google search to be via curl in Terminal, or in a browser app?
