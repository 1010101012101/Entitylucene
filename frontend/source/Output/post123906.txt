Can you make Mac's Menu Bar hide? <body> We all know you can simply click "turn hiding on" in Dock's Preferences, but can you do the same thing to Mac's strongMenu Bar/strong?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wY50r.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer123914> From my dear friend Google :   You can't hide menu bar without using other apps. See  http://osxdaily.com/2011/02/24/hide-mac-menu-bar/ Note that when you are using a full-screen application, menu bar is hidden and it appears when you move the cursor to the top of your screen  <answer212706> As of OS X El Capitan (10.11), this functionality is built in to the operating system. Go to SystemÂ Preferences  General  and turn on "Automatically hide and show the menu bar."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P1DpL.png" alt=""  Here is how it works:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pyRtF.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <comment180254> That's kind of the problem. I want to make it stop popping up when I'm watching a video on fullscreen. <comment180279> @cedeelbe you should add more info about your issue if its the same as the OP one, or post another question
