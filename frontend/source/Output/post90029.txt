Stop Reminders App from sending emails every time a change is made on a shared reminder list <body> I have a shared reminders list with my wife. For the last couple of weeks any time she updates/deletes an item I get an email - however when I update she doen't get an email. She  is the owner of the shared list.  I cannot for the life of me figure out how to stop these emails.  Any help gratefully received.  Alan  <answer91195> My guess is that you have not registered and verified the email address you are receiving the emails at as an alternate email address for your Apple ID (or you have multiple Apple IDs and have registered the email address with the wrong one).
