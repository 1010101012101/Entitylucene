Disconnect an internal hard drive imac <body> I have an iMac with a broken internal hard drive. I have since attached an external HD that I use as my main HD. Half of the old one is corrupted and I can't do anything to it.   On startup however, it runs apps that's still installed in it. I would just like to disconnect it somehow. Is there an easy software way to do it?  <comment319659> Why not fix the drive?  This sounds like a very convoluted workaround. <comment319660> Easier said than done. <comment319664> The reason I say that is because the time you think you are saving here will compound into a massive mess later on - you are already seeing it start to manifest now.  There's no software to "hide a drive" so the easiest thing you could do is just delete the partition and make it unusable. Why is replacing the drive so "out of the question?" <comment319668> Cracking open an iMac can be easy, or difficult, depending on the model. The iFixit site has plenty of [how-to guides on opening and fixing iMacs](https://www.ifixit.com/Search?query=imac). Perhaps Harry can find the guide for the particular iMac in question to determine whether it is a task he wishes to take on himself, or leave to other, more accomplished iMac crackers. <comment319683> Sounds like you want to prevent auto-mount: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231756/how-to-prevent-automount-of-a-partition-in-el-capitan <comment320030> @AllInOne that sounds like it yeah! If you could make an answer explaining how to do it what fstab is or how to get the uuid i would appreciate it
