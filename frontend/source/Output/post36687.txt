iPhone 4s problems making calls <body> My original 4s had issues with phone calls. Half the time calls were made the person on the other end couldn't hear me. Took to Apple store and they gave me a new phone. I've had it 5 days and it has more issues then my 1st one. 50% of the time I make calls neither person can hear each other. I can't even hear it dialing the #, but I watch the call timer run as it does connect. Tried restoring the phone, but still no luck. Is it a hardware issue or AT&amp;T issue? Anyone know?  <answer36692> It sounds like an issue with the hardware of the phone. I'd take it back to the Apple Store and have them swap it again. Before you leave, make a few calls on the new phone and make sure the issue is resolved. I've seen this issue pretty frequently on iPhone 4/S's  <comment41757> that sounds like a bit of bad luck getting two faulty devices <comment99420> Tom - ill close this since its not useful without any follow up. We can reopen it if you have an answer or further detail that might help people other than e info to get help with the phone provided by Matt
