Why is launchd saying "service already loaded" but "launchctl list" doesn't show the service? <body> I created the configuration files in  ~/Library/LaunchAgents  When I attempted to load the plist, I got the message that the service was already loaded.    precodelaunchctl load ~/LaunchAgents/hosts_Blocksites_AM.plist   /Users/bryan/LaunchAgents/hosts_Blocksites_AM.plist: service already loaded   /code/pre  When I attempted to find the Launchd agent nothing was returned.     precode$ sudo launchctl list | grep hosts_Blocksites_AM.plist /code/pre  EDIT: fixed typo where I had:br     launchctl load ~/LaunchAgents/hosts_unBlocksites_AM.plist      <answer250314> It's possibly because you grep'ed for a different file than you tried to load (hosts_strongun/strongBlocksites_AM.plist vs. hosts_Blocksites_AM.plist), but also note that root has its own list of launch agents and when you run codesudo launchctl list/code you will see root's list, which is different from codelaunchctl list/code which will show yours.  So this should work (depending on what you're trying to do in your launch agent):  precodelaunchctl list | grep Blocksites launchctl load ~/LaunchAgents/hosts_unBlocksites_AM.plist /code/pre  If needed, run both as sudo (not just one of them).  <comment310765> Try simplifying your `grep` statement and using the `-i` option in case you don't have the case correct (no pun intended):  `| grep -i blocksites` <comment310808> That was a typo. I actually have hosts_unBlocksites_AM.plist and    hosts_Blocksites_AM.plist    Loaded with launchctl and neither show up in the:          launchctl list | grep -i blocksites <comment311069> Check what you used for the Label string in your plist file. This is the string that is printed from `launchctl list`. Assuming standard formatting of the plist file, then `grep -A 1 Label ~/LaunchAgents/hosts_Blocksites_AM.plist` will show the Label string you used.
