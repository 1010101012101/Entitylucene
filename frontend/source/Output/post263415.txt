Macbook pro mid 2012 connected with Dell U2515H with miniport cable <body> I've a problem with my new monitor U2515H. Once I connect the MacBook pro (mid 2012) with the stock U2515H mini DisplayPort - DisplayPort cable the result is this:  img src="https://s16.postimg.org/alhkhef79/IMG_20161202_222922428_HDR.jpg" alt="IMG_20161202_222922428_HDR.jpg".  I don't know if is a cable or port or monitor problem, because as I read this mac is compatible with the dell monitor.   By the way I've tried with a DisplayPort/HDMI but the max resolution is 2048x1152 instead the maximum one 2560x1440.  anyone have ever had this issue? or someone did already tried this mac/monitor combination with the maximum resolution?  <comment332966> This can be solved with a clean OS clean install
