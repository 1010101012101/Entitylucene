What's the shortcut for plus (adding) and minus (removing) by default <body> In list elements inside System Preferences, I see a "plus" and a "minus" to add or remove elements (see photo below for example of Networking System Preferences).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RFGPH.png" alt="enter image description here"  In Windows these are usually associated with kbdInsert/kbd / kbdDelete/kbd or kbdAlt/kbdkbdA/kbd / kbdAlt/kbdkbdD/kbd. Is there keyboard shortcuts for these keys? I am trying to add keyboard shortcuts in preference without using a mouse but I have to rely on tab key to achieve this.  <comment360777> I don't think there's any way of doing this built into OS X, but there are apps that will allow it. I use Shortcat (https://shortcatapp.com) which allows you to "click" onscreen elements by typing. I just tried in the Network pane in System Preferences, and typing 'add' in Shortcat focuses on the + button. Typing 'dele' was enough to select the - button. <comment360838> @JayThompson Exactly what I needed. Thanks! This is a great start for me with OS X! <comment360842> You can also go to System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts. There's a setting to enable "All Controls" for full keyboard access on windows and dialogs. Then you can just press tab to highlight the buttons you need to click. Useful thorough the system.
