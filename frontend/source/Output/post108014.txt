"iPad Not Charging" Notification is annoying - Mavericks <body> I get this really damn annoying banner every time I plug in my iPad and sometimes when I build and go in Xcode it loses connection with the iPad for a second and reconnects straight away.  Anyone know how to get rid of this notification? I know my iPad won't charge on this Mac Pro, it predates the iPad so it has less power going through the USB ports.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/za62R.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer112921> To turn off notifications:  precodesudo defaults write com.apple.usbd NoiPadNotifications -bool YES sudo killall usbd /code/pre  To turn them back on:  precodesudo defaults delete com.apple.usbd NoiPadNotifications /code/pre  Via Craig Hockenberry  <comment133505> Have you tried using a powered USB hub that provides enough juice to actually charge the iPad? <comment133506> He's asking how to get rid of the message, not how to charge his iPad. <comment133507> This *should* only appear when connected through a USB hubâ€”perhaps standalone, on a monitor, or in a keyboard. Have you verified that the issue persists when directly plugged in to the Mac Pro? <comment133508> Its an old mac pro, it has a lower amperage than the newer macs created after the original iPad was released. <comment133509> That does not change the fact that the alert *should* (note my original phrasing; it's not ambiguous) only happen when connected to a USB hub of some sort. That's why I asked a clarifying question that you have not bothered to actually answer. <comment133510> I'm plugging it into the computer directly, no hub, this isn't unfamiliar behavior, I already know it's not going to charge, it's a limitation with an old Mac. What I want is to get rid of the annoying notification. Previous iterations of OS X was not notifying on the computer at all, it would just show on the iPad that it wasn't charging,
