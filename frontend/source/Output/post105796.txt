Is there any place to download Apple Configurator 1.3? <body> I would like to use Apple Configurator for our Store iPads, but I can't upgrade my iMac to 10.8 (min. Requirement for AC 1.4) right now.  Where can I get 1.3 or any other version that I could install on 10.7.5?  <answer116938> https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ldzpp9ajy7y82k/Apple%20Configurator%201.2.1.zip  I found it on https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com  Hope it will work.  <comment252067> The usual warnings regarding downloading Apple software from non-apple sources applies. Proceed with care. <comment284468> Link not found... :-(
