How to compile PHP with OpenSSL on OS X 10.9? <body> So I'm while trying to compile codePHP/code 5.6.10 from the source faced the following problem:  precodeUndefined symbols for architecture x86_64:   "_PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC", referenced from:       _zif_openssl_pbkdf2 in openssl.o   "_TLSv1_1_client_method", referenced from:       _php_openssl_setup_crypto in xp_ssl.o   "_TLSv1_1_server_method", referenced from:       _php_openssl_setup_crypto in xp_ssl.o   "_TLSv1_2_client_method", referenced from:       _php_openssl_setup_crypto in xp_ssl.o   "_TLSv1_2_server_method", referenced from:       _php_openssl_setup_crypto in xp_ssl.o ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) make: *** [libs/libphp5.bundle] Error 1 /code/pre  The codeOpenSSL/code is installed via codeBrew/code. In codePHP included like/code--with-openssl=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2c`  P.S. Before tried to use just code/usr/code for codeOpenSSL/code but got the same error.  <comment252448> I have this same issue, did you manage to fix it? <comment253856> on OS X using --with-ssl=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/{version} works on compiling most apps that depend on it. If not, what is the error?
