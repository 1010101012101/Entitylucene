Netbeans or Eclipse on macOS Sierra - Java problems <body> I want to install Eclipse or Netbeans on macOS Sierra. When I try to run Eclipse, I get an warning that Java 6 is needed. I downloaded the latest version of Eclipse to be sure.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zH4Co.png" alt="To open Eclipse you need to install the legacy Java SE 6 runtime"  So I tried Netbeans:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SmwFs.png" alt="Netbeans - No JDK found"  While at the same time the System settings report that Java 8 is installed and up to date.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzd7w.png" alt="macOS System settings for Java"  strongHow can I get either Eclipse or Netbeans working on macOS Sierra?/strong  <answer272027> You need to install the full JDK version of Java 8 (codejdk-8u121-macosx-x64.dmg/code) rather than just the JRE.  The JRE install does not include the support to run Java programs outside of a browser.  <comment341861> Which version of eclipse and you should have the 64bit one and what java did you  install? <comment341901> Java 8 version 121, see the screenshot. Eclipse Neon (eclipse-inst-mac64.tar.gz) so 64 bit - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/neon/R2a/eclipse-inst-mac64.tar.gz&mirror_id=1208
