How to unlock disk after unsuccessful upgrade? <body> I tried to upgrade to OSX Yosemite on my MacBook Pro. I had only 4GB of free disk space. Everything went fine until it said only a minute remaining. This was on for 8 hours. Eventually I restarted the system. It booted to OSX Utilities.  I can mount my disk and browse it using Terminal, but when I try "repairing", it says it could not be repaired and that I have to backup and erase the disk. ("Invalid sibling link", "File system check exit code is 8")  When I try "reinstall", it says "this disk is locked".  All my files are still there and everything looks fine in Terminal. So I was wondering if the "lock" is just a flag that I can unset.  (I am typing this on my phone, I'm sorry for the typos.)  <comment181752> Do you need  to recover any data on the disk? <comment181796> Yes, it is all my important data.
