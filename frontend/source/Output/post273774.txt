My Mac has Python3 and 2.7 installed. How do I uninstall Python3 but keep 2.7? <body> I installed python3 a few days ago, but I need to use version 2.7 for school. When I run in terminal, it shows like below:  precodeRandeMacBook-Pro:~ ranshu$ which python /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python RandeMacBook-Pro:~ ranshu$ which python3 /usr/local/bin/python3 /code/pre  I tried to uninstall python3 in Finder but my Mac still used python3.  How do I cleanly uninstall version 3?  <answer273804> If you used homebrew to install python3 the command to remove it is  precodebrew rmtree python3 /code/pre  You should be able to have both versions installed. Call your scripts via  precode python myScript.py /code/pre  This will use your python2.7. If you want to use python3 the command would be  precodepython3 myScript.py /code/pre
