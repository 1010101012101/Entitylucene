How do I remove songs from the cloud <body> I have removed my son's death metal junk from my library but the devices still pick it up from the cloud.  How do I delete songs from the cloud if they no longer appear in the host ITunes library?  I have deleted the unwanted songs from the host PC which should have removed them from iTunes Match but when I synch my iPad mini to iTunes Match the files still appear and can be played on the iPad when I have access to the cloud thru WiFi.   The songs are gone from the host PC but apparently are still in accessible to my other devices thru iTunes Match.   <answer94499> Right click on the item and select delete.

Would you be willing to edit your question with a few more details such as the device(s) that still have the songs, how they got there in the first place, etc. <comment108360> Use iTunes Match with the original songs on a PC.  I originally set up the iTunes Match with my son's old files still on the PC. I have since, deleted them but when I load to my iPad (thru Wifi connection) the old deleted files appear in the cloud.
