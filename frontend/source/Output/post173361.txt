Change Active Directory Password Expiration Prompt in OS X Yosemite <body> I'm looking for a way to change the default Active Directory password expiration prompt at login from 30 days to our current IT policy of 14 days.   Every time a user logs in on a Mac with Active Directory, they get a 30 day notice, but on a PC they get a 14 day notice, so I know it's something local to the Mac and not something controlled through the servers.  I cannot for the life of me find the .plist that controls this and all other information I can find is extremely out of date.   Any advice?  <answer207495> From Apple AD Integration Guide:  http://training.apple.com/pdf/wp_integrating_active_directory_yosemite.pdf     Login Window Password  Expiration Interval  An administrator can   change the  default expiration notification for  the Login Window from   the  command line:    defaults write / Library/Preferences/   com.apple.loginwindow  PasswordExpirationDays    -int code&lt;number of days&gt;/code   codedefaults write / Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow  PasswordExpirationDays -int 14/code  <comment203936> Mac users are more trustworthy ? :) <comment203940> The Group Policy configuration for Mac users is obviously different than that for Windows users, and this config is on the AD server side. You'll have to ask your Window's sys admins to make the change. <comment204129> Thank you. We'll see what my IT group says. ^^
