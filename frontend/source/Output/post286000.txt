Any way to make a transparent Keynote background? <body> Longtime Keynote user, and I'm starting to turn many of my Keynotes into movies that I can drop into Screenflow (a video editing app). I'm doing a lot of animated text instruction videos, and wondering if there's a way to create a keynote that has a clear transparent background, so that if I add other images into the Screenflow timeline, they can appear in the background of the Keynote movie. I'm pretty sure the answer is no, but I wanted to ask. Adding text into Screenflow is 10x slower than Keynote. Keynote really is the best text animator I've found for videos.  <answer286002> Screenflow supports Chroma Key, to automatically remove the background of your video.  ol liIn your Keynote presentation, open the Format inspector and choose Edit Master Slide./li liFor each master slide in use, set the slide background to green, then choose Done.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sH2nX.png" width="352"/li liWhen you import your Keynote video into Screenflow, select the video and under VideoÂ Properties, add a Video Filter for Chroma Key.  ul liScreenflow - Using Chroma Key/li /ul/li /ol  <comment360936> Perfect! thank you so much. <comment360958> @user Welcome to Ask Different!
