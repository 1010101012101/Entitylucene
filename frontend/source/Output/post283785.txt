If you hide an item you purchased in the Mac App Store, you won't get update notifications for it, and you won't see it on your Purchases page. If you're using Family Sharing, hidden items will also be hidden from your family members.  h2Hide purchases using these steps:/h2  ol liOpen the Mac App Store./li liChoose codeStore &gt; Sign In/code, then enter your Apple ID and password./li liClick Purchases./li liRight-click the item that you want to hide and choose strongHide Purchase/strong.

The file contains all updates installed lately, but is also cleaned by the system regularly.  <comment357848> I don't think you can remove that section.  However, you can hide/unhide your MAS purchases on an individual basis.  Is that something you'd like to do? <comment357852> If the consequence is that they disappear from the section I show, yes, I'd like that. Otherwise no. :/ My unique goal is to remove the updates from the list which is selected in my screenshot, the "Last 30 days" list. <comment357858> Thanks, this will be helpful for other cases, but unfortunately it doesn't remove the hidden app from the list of recently updated apps. Great tip nonetheless. <comment357859> Sorry, this was as close as I could find and I thought it would work.  If it doesn't help your issue, I can delete it. <comment357860> It doesn't solve my issue, I just tried. But this is a good tip, related to the question. I don't know if you should delete it. I'll let you judge of that. ;) <comment357862> Thanks.  I'll leave it in the hopes it helps others who might have a similar issue and get here using the search.  Hopefully, someone will be able to provide an answer that better addresses your problem. <comment357867> It worked. Thanks a lot!
