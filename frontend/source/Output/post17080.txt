Opt / Private Folder visible on HD? <body> for some reason my /opt /private folders are not hidden anymore while the rest of my finder's hidden files are.  What would cause these to be visible again, and how do I change them back?  I know it has something to do with permissions, or fixing it might involve using "chflags"command.  strongupdate:/strong so I fixed it after some searching around by using emchflags/em     sudo chflags hidden /opt /private   though Im still curious what caused these files to change.

As to why - you might need to track that down using fs_usage, but typically it's an installer that brute forces permissions or otherwise removed the metadata flags from those files.  <comment18601> oh nice!  thanks bmike for the info
