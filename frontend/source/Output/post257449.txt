Disk space not reporting correctly <body> Trying to do a manual backup of a 64Gb iPhone to an Mac Book Pro running Mountain Lion, iTunes stated that there wasn't enough disk space.  I deleted enough files so that Finder reports almost 95Gb free.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jlsAA.png" alt="enter image description here"  iTunes still states that there isn't enough space. On closer inspection, Disk Utility reports only about 20Gb free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSjYR.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've repaired disk permissions and verified and fixed the disk, booted in Recovery mode, but the reports are still the same.  I should have enough space, but clearly something is wrong here. Can someone please tell me what I can do to get the reporting correct and consistent?  <answer257469> If you have automatic Time Machine backups on:  Try to disable automatic Time Machine backup  Wait 5 minutes, Then try again  When you're done enable Time Machine again  <comment321491> There is no such thing as an iMac Pro. <comment321546> @IronCraftMan Thanks for the irrelevant comment! <comment321547> You're a genius! That worked; any idea why Time Machine is causing this? <comment321549> Time Machine snapshots: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204015 <comment321662> `Finder and Get Info windows don't include them in their calculations.` - that's poor design. Thanks ;O)
