Browsers performance in OS X <body> This is to collect the UI performance experiences we have with browsers in OS X. I don't care about the benchmarks I care about how fast the UI responds to the user's actions.  I have come to the following conclusions:  ul liChrome tab switching is the fastest./li liSafari sometimes is unresponsive (shows the waiting cursor) even for simple HTML pages with out having a lot of tabs open. This has never happened in Chrome./li liSafari's Javascript Cancvas drawing is the fastest./li liSafari's location bar recommendations is the fastest./li /ul  I expect your own observations.  <answer4583> Lifehacker actually did an article on this with hard data:   <comment4451> this is a question that can't really have an "answer", or even several excellent opionions! browsers are always changing and every user uses them differently! <comment4452> but I think it's a good question and not ranked as subjective. <comment4463> Maybe it could be a Community Wiki where we add information as the time passes. <comment8256> Seriously, it's a matter of RAM. Get more RAM and you will see dramatic improvements concerning responsiveness when many tabs are open simultaneously. You need at least 4GB. I had 2GB and was frustrated like you and upped to 8GB and it's like night and day. Looking at Activity Monitor, I was ALWAYS using all 2GB and now that I have 8GB, I find that I'm usually using 3-5GB. So I recommend 4GB or, if you can afford it, 8GB. Anything more is overkill though. Got 8GB from Amazon for $130, by the way.
