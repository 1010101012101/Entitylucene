Dock shortcut for an interactive bash script <body> I'm new to OSX and all I want it an application shortcut in Dock that opens the terminal and types the first command and waits for me to provide the password. Here is the script I want to run:  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash sudo openconnect --user={username} {host} /code/pre  And here is the AppleScript I created using Automator:  precodedo shell script "/usr/local/bin/openconnect --user={user} {host}" with administrator privileges /code/pre  But when I run it, it exits when it asks for username and password. What am I missing here?  <answer196398> Alright, I think I found the answer:  precodetell application "Terminal"     do script "sudo /usr/local/bin/openconnect --user={user} {host}"     activate end tell /code/pre  <answer196888> Instead of having an Automator/AppleScript applet to run this command, you can use Terminal to automatically run that command upon launch.  ol liIn Terminal, go to Terminal  Preferences./li liIn the General pane, under "Shells open with:", select "Command (complete path):"/li liEnter your command in the text field. /li /ol  Now, when Terminal opens, that command will execute automatically.  If you wish to be able to launch Terminal and open a window that doesn't run the command automatically, disregard the above steps, and follow the following steps:  ol liIn Terminal, go to Terminal  Preferences./li liIn the Profiles pane, on the list on the left, find the default profile, and select it./li liAt the bottom left, click the sprocket &#9881; icon, and click "Duplicate Profile". Label the duplicate with something that indicates that the command won't run on this profile./li liBack on the default profile, under the Startup label, tick the "Run command:" checkbox, and enter your command in the text box. Ensure that "Run inside shell" is ticked also./li liClose Terminal, and relaunch. When a window opens, it should run your command by default. To open a Terminal window without your command running, go to Shell  New Window  Name of the duplicate profile./li /ol  <comment235279> Thanks, but I wanted to have an application icon in my Dock to avoid opening the terminal. Is possible to have a terminal launcher in Dock which opens a specific profile by default? <comment235281> There doesn't seem to be anything in the Terminal dictionary for profile-related objects. Why not put the Terminal in the dock, after following the second set of steps in my answer? The Terminal will open no-matter-what, so why not dock it? <comment235284> With my approach, I have the terminal in dock but I also have another icon in dock just for my vpn connection. What if I want to open a terminal without running the VPN? How many clicks do I need to switch between the profiles?  Also, the VPN is sticky. It's there as long as I'm connected so I can't use the same terminal for other stuff. I'll need another window. Unless I make two windows which will be opened by default when terminal is launched.
