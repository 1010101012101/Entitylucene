Give people who bought a paid version of an app a "free" IAP? <body> I have two different apps on the App Store, one is the paid version of the free one. This was from a time when they were no in-app payments.  Is there a possibility to make the people who bought my paid app get the IAP for free?  I'd like to just go for ONE free app that includes the functionality of the full version after buying the upgrade as an IAP. However, I don't want the users who already bought the paid version to spend money for the app again.  <comment312914> Short answer is yes but it will take updating the apps first to either write a boolean value to indicate who has paid or using a lookup to a value you keep in a cloud database for the same thing.  This question will probably get more detailed answers, the kind you're probably looking for, on StackOverflow.  There's also plenty examples of how to do this from various developer sites, including [this one](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/14638).
