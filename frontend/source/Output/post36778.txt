Adding new contact to iMessage group chat <body> With iMessage there is a group chat feature similar to the feature in Whats App. But I can't find a way to add new people to an ongoing group chat.  Is this possible?   <answer84083> No. Its not possible, though its nice feature to add to in next version.  <answer94306> You can, go create new message then where it says recipients (or to:) add as many people (On imessage) as you like.   <answer192152> This is possible in Yosemite: just click "Add Contactâ€¦" in the Details pane.  <comment41826> There seems to be no ability to add/edit the recipient of an iMessage/SMS text. You can select Edit and then Forward all or parts of an ongoing message to others, but there is no context (who said what). <comment110553> That unfortunately only works for new group messages, not to extend existing ones (which is what the asker is looking for). <comment140399> Does anyone know if this feature (add/remove to/from group text) will be in the next upgrade? <comment165987> i believe you have to wait for iOS 8
