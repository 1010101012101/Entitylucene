Is there a Mail plugin to let me view unread emails first? <body> Similar to Gmail priority inbox, is there a Mail 6.3 (OSX Mountain Lion) plugin that lets me view unread messages first or sort them so they're at top of inbox?  <answer87642> In Mac's mail app you have got the option to create a 'smart mailbox'. This allows you for example to only view unread emails. It can even do that over multiple mailboxes.  Sample rule for unread messages of today (taken from makeusof.com):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YgCks.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you just want to have the unread messages always on top, there's a sort option for that in the menu between Edit and Mailbox (probably called View).  <answer87750> In addition to Vincent's answer, you can be more creative with your Smart Mailboxes, but since you're in Mountain Lion, you can sort any Smart Mailbox by Unread/Read status.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2vmcd.jpg" alt="Sort Mailbox"  <comment102466> Sorting by "unread" is built in already <comment102467> To make this an even better answer: can you add a (link to a) screenshot showing how such a mailbox could be defined? <comment102468> I would, but my OSX is in Dutch (and therefore Mail too), so I think it will not be very helpful. However, here is a website to a tutorial that does pretty much the same: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/five-essential-smart-mailboxes-for-apple-mail-mac/ <comment102622> Used Tiger and Snow Leopard for a long time. Need to learn the new Mail in Mountain Lion better.  Thanks for pointing that out. <comment102623> Can I mark your comment as best answer? <comment102624> I would take out the Date Received is Today, since that may filter messages you received yesterday that are unread. Also You can add "Message is in Mailbox: Inbox" to filter any other folders you may not be interested in. <comment102625> You can't accept comments, but I'm fine if you accept @Vincent's answer below (which I've just edited to include the sorting stuff as well). <comment102764> You are welcome!
