Generic icons in Finder side bar? <body> I am running into an issue whereby the icons for things like 'Music', 'Movies' and 'Pictures' in the windows of the Finder side bar are showing up as generic document icons. I should note, that device icons are displaying correctly.  Also, if I relaunch the Finder then the icons disappear and I need put them back, via the Finder preferences.  Can anyone suggest a solution?  I am using macOS X Sierra (10.12).  Below is screenshot illustrating what I am seeing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/85KL5.png" alt="Screen shot showing issue"  <answer258213> Removing the files in ~/Library/Preferences, containing 'finder' in their name seems to have resolved the issue.
