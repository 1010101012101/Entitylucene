Can I charge the 12" macbook with Nintendo switch charger? <body> Just wondering if I could charge my 12inch macbook with the type-c adopter that came with the Nintendo switch   https://store.nintendo.co.uk/nintendo-switch-accessory/nintendo-switch-power-adapter/11396099.html   <answer275499> I have tested on the 2015 MacBook 12". Works perfectly. Charges at 15.3V @ 1,9A = 28,7W. The MacBook 12" charger also works on the Switch.  USB-C and recent USB Power Delivery standards make this a fairly safe bet in terms of cross platform interoperability. As long as the charger or cable aren't knockoff, you should expect reasonable results mixing vendors.   Reasonable is a 15 inch MacBook Pro clearly won't run and charge from a 30 watt adapter (whether Apple or Nintendo), but if powered off, it will slowly and safely charge itself at the rate the connected adapter provides.   <comment346060> Even if someone here says it's ok, would you really take the chance on a non-warrantied fry-out of your MB motherboard to use a $25 charger? <comment346393> @fsb I agree its risky, but the whole promise of USB-C is inter-compatibility and simplification. I am still deeply confused as to what is appropriate to use with which device. While I have no real need for this it would be good to know
