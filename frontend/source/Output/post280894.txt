An image editor with an API (preferably python-oriented) <body> Is there an image editor for OS X (e.g. Preview) that can be operated programmatically, preferably with python, or that has a built-in programming language, like MS Word has VBA built-in (at least on Windows systems)?  I'd like to be able to do the following with code:  ol liOpen an image in the image editor,/li liUse the editor to save the image to some arbitrary location in the file system./li /ol  It is essential for me to save the file via the editor, since when the editor saves a file it does more than simply save it: it also writes meta info, which I am interested in.  hr  macOS Sierra Version 10.12.4  <answer280898> strongPreview/strong supports AppleScript which allows you to open and save files from CLI. There are commands for open and save.  For example, to open a file with Preview:    pre class="lang-default prettyprint-override"codetell application "Preview"     open "/path/to/file.png" end tell /code/pre  You can run AppleScript as a script file, or from the command line using codeosascript -e "…"/code.  pre class="lang-default prettyprint-override"codeosascript -e "tell application \"Preview\"" -e "open \"/path/to/file.png\"" -e "end tell" /code/pre  You can find the full Preview AppleScript dictionary by opening Script Editor.app (from the Utilities folder), choosing File → Open Dictionary and selecting Preview. This will show you many of the commands that Preview supports with the syntax for how to use them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tREC2.png" width="623"  <answer280899> strongImagemagick/strong is a CLI image editor with support for editing image files.  This doesn't present a GUI, but rather provide commands for working with image files directly. There are a plethora of features to support complex editing.  You can install this using Homebrew:  precodebrew install imagemagick /code/pre  For a full list of functionality, see imagemagick.org.  <comment353340> Does the image editor need a GUI? Would a command line image editor be suitable? <comment353341> @grgarside: I dunno. I can certainly give it a try. <comment353342> Thanks. This looks terrific. Do you have any suggestion where I can learn more about AppleScript? I don't even understand what you mean by `osascript -e "…"`. Like, what am I supposed to substitute `"..."` with? How did you get to the screens whose screenshots you included in your answer? <comment353343> @Evan I've edited my answer, let me know if you need anything else. <comment357720> Or you could try the built-in CLI image editor, `sips` (Scriptable image Processing System).
