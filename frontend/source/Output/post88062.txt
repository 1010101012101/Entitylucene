Help to use HD2 on Mac Pro currently on different OSX to HD1. How to unpartition whole system to one user <body> 2nd MacProHD currently running on 10.5.4 and primary HD is on 10.7.5 - I am running out of space on primary HD &amp; want to use my 2ndHD as well (mainly to store the 300GB of music I have). I need to be able to access it easily for use with logic &amp; iTunes. Do I remove the partition / user altogether or do I upgrade HD2 to 10.7.5 and then just use it as is? Ideally I'd like to upgrade the whole lot to Lion and get rid of the 2 user accounts. Is this inadvisable?  Please can somebody tell me how to do it for the best so that I can use 2nd HD easily. Thank you.   <comment103097> We have several question covering this ground.
