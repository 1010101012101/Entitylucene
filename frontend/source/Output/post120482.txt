Rsync exclude-from not working <body> I have created a rsync script which has been working fine until I made recent modifications adding exclude-from clause to it.  When running the script it returns the following error:     rsync error: error in file IO (code 11) at   /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-42/rsync/exclude.c(1005) [client=2.6.9]   The bash script is as follows:  precodeecho "Starting sync..." rsync -vrtL --delete --exclude-from 'sync-music.exclude.txt' ~/Music/ 'remote:/Music/' /code/pre  The sync-music.exclude.txt file consists of this...  precode*.ipa .DS_store Cache/* /code/pre  strongEDIT:/strongbr I have noticed that it works when I am in the CD'd into the folder where the bash and exclude files reside. It must be something to do with the the paths. I have tried adding the path in front of sync-music.exclude.txt but that has not fixed the issue.  <answer120489> I encountered a similar problem.  If you use full paths it should work (note using code~/code does not appear to work).  I found comment in a Ubuntu book "codescp/code assumes that all paths are relative to the home directory of the user unless a full path is given". The same seems to apply to codersync/code
