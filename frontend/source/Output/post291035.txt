Routing problem between OpenVPN and Parallels virtual interfaces <body> I run OpenVPN and Parallels on OSX 10.10.5, Server edition:  ul liOpenVPN 2.4.2 in mode tun, on subnet 10.211.54.0/24/li liParallels in "shared network" mode, on subnet 10.211.55.0/24/li liipv4 forwarding is enabled/li /ul  I have a guest VM at 10.211.55.3 and a VPN client at 10.211.54.6. Both of them have their firewalls disabled. The routes are correctly set in all machines (client, server and guest).   From the server terminal, I can ping both the VM and the VPN client.  From the VPN client, I can ping the Parallels host interface, but I can NOT ping (or otherwise access) the VM guest.  Running tcpdump on the relevant interfaces, while the client pings the guest, shows:  ul lion OpenVPN's interface (utun0), ICMP echo req packets from VPN client, but no echo replies/li lion the Parallels host interface (vnic0), ICMP echo reqs and replies. /li /ul  So, it seems that my packets are getting through from OpenVPN to Parallels, but the packets from Parallels to OpenVPN are getting silently dropped.   EDIT1: The relevant routes on the server are:  precode10.211.54/24       10.211.54.2        UGSc            1        0   utun0 10.211.54.2        10.211.54.1        UH              2        0   utun0 10.211.55/24       link#12            UC              1        0   vnic0 10.211.55.3        0:1c:42:b7:a4:c2   UHLWIi          2   728978   vnic0     /code/pre  EDIT2: The relevant section of the OpenVPN conf file:  precodedev tun server 10.211.54.0 255.255.255.0 push "route 10.211.55.0 255.255.255.0" proto tcp client-to-client /code/pre  What am I missing?  <comment367446> What routes do you have? <comment367449> [answered in OP] <comment367453> Which how-to did you use to setup openvpn? <comment367456> No how-to in particular, just prior experience. I used an all-inclusive conf file which I wrote manually. See EDIT2 in OP for the relevant section.
