Month old iPad mini 4 has a yellow box outline on the screen! What should I do? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jj1eV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I'm pretty sure this was not there before but now I just noticed it while reading on my iPad. I think it's only on the inside part of the screen as I cannot get the picture to show the yellow when I screenshot it...what should I do? Help! It's just over a month old!   <answer233954> Make an appointment with a Genius in an Apple Store and they will swap it for a new one.  <comment285923> Pure guess - you've enabled something in SettingGeneralAccessibility; perhaps Voiceover ? <comment285934> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed. <comment285980> Regarding what you should do, I think @Mathias is right, as long as it's not been water damaged, Apple should replace it for free. <comment288915> Is it related? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/236125/broken-ipad-screen
