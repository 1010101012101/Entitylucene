NTFS support on El Capitan <body> Just a quick question, is NTFS supported on El Capitan? I just plugged in my external hard drive and I am able to copy stuff from it, but not write to it. I guess only read mode is supported?  <answer210251> Not just in El Capitan. That's been the standard behaviour of OS X in regards to NTFS since at least 10.4 (which is the first version I used): you can read, but you can't write.  In addition to the solutions mentioned above, you can also try  NTFS-3G. Or, if you want to go the other way, there's an app called MacDrive for Windows which allows your PC to read Mac-formatted disks.  <answer210871> To enable NTFS write support on OS X 10.11 El Capitan or macOS 10.12 Sierra.  ol liInstall latest osxfuse (3.x.x) from https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases.

For US$31, [Tuxera NTFS for Mac](http://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/) will do NTFS. I don't use either, but I have a colleague who uses Paragon. <comment253733> NTFS Write Support actually exists in OS X however it's turned off by default, probably because of a licensing issue, and an appropriate entry to `/etc/fstab` and the NTFS volume would be writable.  That said the native write support is slower then the third-party utilities mentioned by IconDaemon.  I personally use Tuxera NTFS for Mac, although I keep write-support disabled and only enable it when needed, as it's easily done through Tuxera NTFS in System Preferences.  One thing to be concerned about is any filesystem corruption on the NTFS volume, there are no OS X native utilities to repair. <comment258044> These steps are just great. They worked like a charm...only thing I notice is that, when copying a bunch of files (more than 10 Gb) to an external NTFS-formatted hard drive, I noticed that it is way slower than Tuxera NTFS for Mac...bad thing is that latest version of that is not free (as it used to be some time ago) @Cœur Did you notice this? If so, any way to fix it? Thanks! <comment258077> @Jonathan You can try to build NTFS-3G from source edge: http://stackoverflow.com/a/31014256/1033581 <comment269024> I use Paragon NTFS and it's good. <comment270344> this answer is worked!, NOTE: you need to type csrutil in recovery mode  terminal, and copy sudo line 1 by 1 <comment317225> Didn't work for me. I did a `brew install homebrew/fuse/ntfs-3g`, and after rebooting into recovery mode, I disabled `csrutil`. Then I booted back into normal mode, made the symlink, and then enabled `csrutil` in recovery mode. Now in normal mode, it won't even detect my external drive [NTFS].  Earlier it used to mount as read-only, but now I don't see anything in the finder.  Also, the `sudo dmesg` output is flooded with lines like `Sandbox: coresymbolicatio(1283) System Policy: deny(1) file-write-unlink /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd/data`.  Any help? @Cœur <comment317376> @reza.safiyat, no, didn't face this issue, so can't help. <comment333965> How does this differ from the solution given by Coeur above? <comment333968> Thanks patrix for point. I added step by step solution so that a novice could understand what actually he/she is doing by using these steps.
