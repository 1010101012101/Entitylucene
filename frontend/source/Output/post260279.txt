iPhone 7 Won't Play Music on Bluetooth Headphones <body> My iPhone 7 was playing music over my bluetooth headphones fine up until a few days ago.  Now all music just plays through the iPhone speakers instead.  I looked in the Settings - Bluetooth and the headphones display as "Connected".   This is not a new headset; it was working correctly up until just a few days ago.  When I power up the headset it gives me the same message it usually does when successfully connected to the iPhone, "Power On - Connected".  Is there a setting somewhere that overrides where the audio outputs to?  <answer260282> I realized that it stopped working after I updated to the latest version of iOS.  After going into the Bluetooth settings and "forgetting" the headphones and then re-pairing it worked fine.
