New MacBook Pro unable to detect external display (Thunderbolt3 >2 > hdmi) <body> I tried to connect a new MacBook Pro to an external display, like I did before.  But the new book only have Thunderbolt3 ports, my previous Thunderbolt2 and HDMI adaptor could no longer work, I bought a new Thunderbolt3 /2 adaptor.  But it seemed that Mac could not recognize the external display,  Any idea what might be wrong?
