Desktop wallpapers disappear when switch from dual displays to single <body> I started bringing my 2011 MacBook Air to work and hook it up to an external monitor for dual display setup. But when I unplug the display, the desktop wallpapers on the built-in LCD disappears and just show a solid light gray desktop. I have to log out and log back in to get the desktop wallpapers to show again. Is there a way to fix this?  Many apps also still behave as they were on the external monitor. Do I have to use "gather windows" every time I disconnect the external monitor?  <answer63768> I also observed the problem after upgrading my MacBook Air (2011) to Mountain Lion.  Not only unplugging the external display triggers the gray background, but also connecting to a display.  For the gray background problem, I use a quick-and-dirty fix: restart the Dock. Invoke the following command in the terminal: code$ killall Dock/code  The Dock will be restarted after it is killed, and the wallpaper will appear again.  <answer64477> After some exprimenting, it seems that disconnecting the external display first while the macbook is still open fixes the issue. The problem only arise if I close the lid before unplugging the external display.  <answer90801> Another workaround is to open Terminal and type "killall Dock" at the prompt.  <comment73767> I noticed that once I upgraded my late-2011 MBP to 10.8.1 I had to reset all my background preferences as well, external 27" at work - both displays set to randomly display from a custom folder every hour.  I forgot exactly what I did but eventually the settings did 'stick'; try setting the preferences the way you want without the external monitor, log out, connect the monitor, log back in, and try setting them again.  Rather, rinse, repeat..
