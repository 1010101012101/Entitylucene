Build in and build out of two images where one replaces the other in the same slide <body> I'm creating a Keynote presentation.   I have a slide with two overlapping images at the center of the slide. What I want to do is make one of the two disappear when the other appears. This should be done emin one slide/em.  I've tried to add "build" effects or playing around with the orders, but I guess this may not be the right way to do it. I've also looked around on the web, but I've not found anything which really addresses my problem.  <answer274757> ol liAdd build out to the first element and build in to the second.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7GOHB.gif" alt=""/li liSet the build out to be with the build in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWIZw.gif" alt=""/li /ol  Preview:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K8c85.gif" alt=""
