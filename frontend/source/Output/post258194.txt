Copying one file multiple times and then renaming them <body> I need to copy a Word doc (it is a different Word document each time) a certain number of times into a new folder and then rename them sequentially starting at a different number.   For instance, I have emThisDoc.docx/em and I need to copy it 105 times into emThatFolder/em with the name emThatDoc005.docx/em starting with value 005 (the numbers need to be always three places).  The result of this should be a folder that contains the 105 copies of emThisDoc.docx/em but renamed emThatDoc005.docx, ThatDoc006.docx, ThatDoc007.docx, ThatDoc008.docx/em, etc.   It can be done in Terminal, though, while I have admin privileges on my personal computer, at work, I need to be able to do it in one line.   The Windows Powershell equivalent is:  precode5 .. 110 | %{cp path/ThisDoc.docx ("path/ThatDoc{0:D3}.docx" -f $_)} /code/pre  In Automator, I have the problem that I can't access it at work so it needs to be able to be saved as an application that will ask for the first file, the destination folder, the number of times it needs to be copied and and starting file number.  Thank you in advance, for any and all help!  <answer258940> Try this:  precodefor i in $(seq -f "ThatDoc%03g.docx" 5 110); do cp ThisDoc.docx /path/ThatFolder/$i; done /code/pre  <comment322723> This is better suited to the Linux site isn't it? Or super user <comment322785> @OzzieSpin no because it's referring specifically to an Apple problem in an Apple program <comment323163> Correct, I guess I should have been more clear, I am using Mac OSX El Capitan 10.11.6 <comment323815> Who downvoted this answer?
