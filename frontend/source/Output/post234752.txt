Is there an App for Browsing on iOS and watching on OS X? <body> I would like to browse video website on my iPhone and start watching videos on my Mac. I don't want to use Airplay as my Wifi connection is not good. I would like to just send an URL to a video player like VLC on my Mac which streams the video itself.  <answer234769> This is the sort of thing that Handoff (part of Continuity) would ideally be used for, but third-parties have been very slow to adopt it. And you presumably want something better than pasting URLs into the built-in Notes app, with iCloud syncing turned on.  If it's always URLs you want to send, your best bet is possibly a third-party tool for sharing and syncing clipboard items between iOS and Mac, such as Cloud Clip.
