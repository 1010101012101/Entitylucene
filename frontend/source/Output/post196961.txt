Cellular data turns on frequently even if i turned it off <body> I have a problem where my cellular data usage setting turns itself on frequently.  When I am in range of WiFi my iPhone uses only WiFi but when I am out of range it turns on my cellular data even if it's off this makes is use up my balance in my sim card.  I have even closed all my apps using cellular data in emsettings  cellular  use cellular data for.../em but that did not help.  When I am out of WiFi signal range, and even with my cellular data setting turned to off, it turns on automatically.  <comment235413> Maybe turn on airplane mode and then turn wifi back on? <comment235457> You mean you have cellular data off and it switches on on its own? or that even when off your data usage keeps increasing? <comment235578> thanks bro but if i turned on airplane mode i cant have any calls  or anything. (dwightk) <comment235579> yes my cellular data turns on automatically  their is no app  forcing it  because i have closed all of them.
