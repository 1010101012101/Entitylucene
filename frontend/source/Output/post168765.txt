Is it possible to extend the time i'm logged as administrator when enter sudo mode from the console? <body> Is it possible to extend the time i'm logged as administrator when enter sudo mode from the console? If yes, how?  <answer168766> In the terminal type this to open a file to edit:  precodesudo visudo /code/pre  Find this:  precodeDefaults        env_reset /code/pre  And replace with this:  precodeDefaults        env_reset,timestamp_timeout=NUMBER /code/pre  Where codeNUMBER/code is the number of minutes to time-out.  Then save the file.  <answer168767> Yes, it is possible.  Edit the sudoers file by typing the following at the command prompt:  precodesudo visudo /code/pre  Find the section commented with code# Defaults specification/code and look for a line like this:  precodeDefaults  env_reset /code/pre  Change that line to:  precodeDefaults  env_reset,timestamp_timeout=10 /code/pre  Where you can replace code10/code with whatever the number of minutes you'd like for the sudo password to live. Save the changes and you're done.  Edit: if you don't like to use codevi/code you can tell codevisudo/code to use another editor. The editor must block until you're done with your edits. Just set the codeEDITOR/code environment variable before envoking codevisudo/code and it will use that editor instead:  precodeEDITOR=/usr/bin/nano sudo visudo /code/pre  would use codenano/code to edit the file instead. I recommend you emdo not/em use a graphical editor like Sublime Text without knowing how to run the editor, from the command line, in blocking mode (for codesubl/code that means calling it with code--wait/code).  <answer168770> codesudo bash/code  You may now remain the root user for as long as you want. No tinkering with system files required.  codeexit/code or code&lt;control-d&gt;/code to return to the normal universe.  <comment198124> I don't think this is a good idea to keep remaining as root user. since this doesn't need sudo at all, it's more dangerous. <comment198541> How would I do it in nano rather than vi / vim? <comment198543> sudo nano /etc/sudoers <comment198564> @codecowboy that's not a good way to do it. `visudo` just doesn't edit the `/etc/sudoers` file directly. It edits a copy of the file and, when you save it, it verifies that copy is syntactically correct before it replaces `/etc/sudoers` with the copy. This is very important. It's super is easy to screw that file up and bork your system. See above for how you use another editor if `vi` isn't your thing. <comment198638> Interestingly enough, `visudo` takes the editor from `$EDITOR` if defined while `sudo -e` (which can be used to edit any file) first looks at `$SUDO_EDITOR`. <comment198646> This is not the answer to the question, but I'd argue, that if you have a lot to do as a root it's much more feasible to actually log in as one. Tho I preffer to do 'sudo su -', or just du sudo passwd, create password for root, and then just use 'su -' to switch to root... Anyway, that's outside of the scope of the question. <comment199516> @nelson explain the difference between getting a root shell and prefixing every command with `sudo` <comment199517> @MarekBettman it exactly answers the question. Q: "How do I extend the time..." A: "sudo bash - infinite time" <comment199600> I may not want to give blanket root shell access to someone. In this case, extending the time to live on cached sudo credentials is markedly different from just getting a shell with elevated privileges. It is also considered exceptionally bad system administration hygiene to elevate a shell like this. Typing an additional word to run a command with elevated privledges keeps you conscious of the seriousness of the act and the damage that can ensue if you're not careful.
