why Chrome pop up from gocomputerhelp247.com/system-alert <body> Why did I suddenly get a message with a Chrome icon to call a phone number immediately because I was under attack? The address was gocomputerhelp247.com/system-alert. It told me under no circumstances to restart my computer.  <answer207186> It is a form of scripted scareware. Someone programmed that pop up message to scare you into wanting to buy a "fix" or perhaps to cause you to stay on a page long enough for them to install malware.   Why not do some research on malware and ask a follow on question if the article you found doesn't do a good job of educating you about Internet security and malware.   <comment243810> It's a scam.  Restart your computer and open chrome again, does it come back up? <comment244233> No, ecnepsnai, it did not. Thanks
