How to uninstall Java 1.8 under OS X 10.10 Yosemite? <body> There are a few answers on old questions about the same issue under Lion / Mountain Lion. Now with Java 1.8 and OS X 10.10 I wonder if anything has changed? Would be great to have exact removal steps.  It really is asked too much, for Oracle to provide a proper uninstaller?  <answer175656> An uninstaller might be nice, but you literally have to drag one file to the trash. Doesn't seem too difficult.  Per Java.com:     To uninstall Java, you must have Administrator privileges.      ol   liClick on the Finder icon located in your dock/li   liClick on Applications tab on the sidebar/li   liIn the Search box enter JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/li   liThis will find the JavaAppletPlugin.plugin file/li   liRight click on JavaAppletPlugin.plugin and select Move to Trash/li   /ol   <answer176593> http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jre.html#A1096890 says     To uninstall the JRE, you must have Administrator privileges and execute the remove commands either as root or by using the sudo(8) tool.      Remove one directory and one file (a symlink), as follows:      ul   liNavigate to code/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/code and remove the codeJavaAppletPlugin.plugin/code directory./li   liNavigate to code/Library/PreferencePanes/code and remove codeJavaControlPanel.prefpane/code./li   /ul      Do not attempt to uninstall Java by removing the Java tools from code/usr/bin/code. This directory is part of the system software and any changes will be reset by Apple the next time you perform an update of the OS   Done that. Looking good. I still think it's bad intentions behind not offering an uninstaller. Glad this is off my system.  Commands for the ‘Terminal’ly-inclined:  precodesudo rm -rf /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/ sudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/JavaControlPanel.prefPane /code/pre  <comment207244> That only uninstalls the web plugin not the JDK or old style JRE <comment219050> Hmm. When I view the JavaAppletPlugin.plugin, I see that it is an alias. The original is located at: /System/Library/Java/Support/CoreDeploy.bundle/Contents/   How does deleting the alias remove Java? Is it safe to delete that whole /System/Library/Java directory? Thanks <comment219076> Just delete the alias - never delete anything from /System/* if you don't know what you'r doing.
