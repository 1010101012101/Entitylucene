Recover lost audio after wrong Terminal commands <body> I was researching how to "permanently" disable a MacBook Pro's (Yosemite) internal microphone. I ran a few Terminal commands. It worked! However, I also must have deleted the sound output. I would like to get sound output back. Is this something I can fix? I ran the following commands:  precodesudo srm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/AppleOnboardAudio.kext sudo srm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBAudio.kext sudo srm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/AppleDeviceTreeUpdater.kext sudo srm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/IOAudioFamily.kext sudo srm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/VirtualAudioDriver.kext sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions /code/pre  or at this point is a reimage necessary? If that's the case, which of the commands should I not have ran in order to keep audio output?  <comment349846> Perhaps similar to that question- but I'm looking for more info about the why vs. just reimage and fix it. <comment349857> Without definite proof of which .kext or .kexts are responsible, I would hazard a guess that one or more of them handle input _and_ output simultaneously. The file names themselves do not indicate a separation of functions in this way. In the future, do a `sudo cp` or `sudo mv` command to backup the .kext files before you zap them.
