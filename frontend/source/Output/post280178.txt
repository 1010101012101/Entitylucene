Can I remove the Dymo Label Webservice and still use the Dymo Application? <body> I don't like an unnecessary permanent open port from the Dymo Label Webservice when I use the Dymo Application every few weeks.  Is it possible to remove the web service and still use the Application to print a label every now and then?  All I found on the web were instructions to remove the Dymo software completely, which is not my intention.  I have installed the newest version 8.6.1 of the Dymo Label software.  <answer280195> Just delete it, or block the port using a firewall and see if it still prints for you. If not you might have to reinstall the application (or stop blocking the port) to get it working again.  I use Little Snitch as an easy way to block particular connections. Someone smarter than me could probably tell you how to configure the built in firewall to block the connection for free, but you could use the free trial of Little Snitch to at least see if the software keeps working when you keep it from phoning home.   <answer280262> The Dymo Label Webservice is started by a launch agents while booting. You should be able to simply unload the related launch agent:  precodesudo launchctl list | grep dymo #check if agent com.dymo.dls.webservice is loaded sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dymo.dls.webservice.plist /code/pre  You may have to  use the force switch: code... unload -w .../code.  If you are not successful you can try to change the RunAtLoad key in /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dymo.dls.webservice.plist with   codesudo nano /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dymo.dls.webservice.plist/code  from  precode&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  to  precode&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt; &lt;false/&gt; /code/pre  hr  Reboot and check if your Dymo label printer also works without the open port of the webservice.  <comment352724> I edited `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.dymo.dls.webservice.plist`. Now the webservice doesn't start any more and printing still works. Thanks :-)
