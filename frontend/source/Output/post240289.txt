Grab - Impossible to take a snapshot of the window <body> When trying to take a snapshot of a Brackets window with Grab, I get this buggy error message: img src="https://imgh.us/Schermata_2016-06-01_alle_15.45.02.png" alt=""br It says 'Impossible to take a snapshot of the window - The content of this window cannot be shared.'br None of the buttons work (not even the Help one) and to close the message I have to quit Grab via code⌘Q/code.br Taking the snapshot via Preview or code⌘/code+code⇧/code and codespace/code works just well, but I need to take it via Grab because it takes snapshots without shadows and spaces: I have to put together different shots to show all the hidden content of the window, and with a Preview shot the gap is clearly visible because of the shadow:br img src="https://imgh.us/Schermata_2016-06-01_alle_16.37.46.png" alt=""  Did anyone ever encounter this error? What causes it?br Grab works just as it should on other programs, it has problems only with Brackets.br Thank you :)  <comment295326> You can take shadowless screenshots by holding opt(alt) as you click the window - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/50860/how-do-i-take-a-screenshot-without-the-shadow-behind-it - however that may not fix your issue with Brackets. It's not an app I've used, so I can't help for that specifically. <comment295340> Thank you @Tetsujin, this helped a lot :D  Although it would be good to know why this ever happens... <comment295342> Sure - & I hope someone with knowledge of Brackets might be able to help. That's why I didn't mark this as a duplicate of the other question, instead just posted the link to possibly help you out - because this might be something very Brackets-specific.
