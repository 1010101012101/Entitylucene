Finnish spell checker for Pages.app '09? <body> Can anyone tell me where I can find a Finnish spell checker for OS X Pages '09 as it is not available through Apple?  <answer92002> You should be able to get one at  http://voikko.sourceforge.net/ports.html  <answer121030> Thanks for the good resource for Finnish spell checker files. I found good installation instructions from:  http://macmaa.com/2012/11/26/suomenkielen-oikoluvun-asennus-mountain-lioniin/
