Use Screen sharing to connect to a generic VNC server <body> Can I use the built-in screen sharing app in Mac OS to connect to any VNC server? If so, how? It asks me for a password when I try to connect, what password is that?  I've been using Chicken up until now and that just connects to the remote host leaving the authentication to me as a user. Is it possible to get Screen Sharing to behave like that?  <comment315783> Today, with chicken, I get a login-window on the linux-host that I connect to. That's what I want with Screen Sharing.app as well. Is it possible? If so, then how?
