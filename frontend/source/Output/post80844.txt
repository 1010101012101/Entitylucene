How to make shell extensions in mac os x <body> Is there an equivalent of context menu extensions for mac os? I would like to port mine from windows.  An example would be the context menu entries for 7-zip or winzip. Specifically I would like to port my utility ShimExt  Update: This emmay/em be what I am looking for: http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/examples/ex03/index.html  I will need to add custom code so I am looking for a more direct way to install a menu into finder but I will research more on automator.  Update 2: I found a real example: Sourcetree actually installs a context menu into Finder. Not sure how yet.  <comment93253> Are [Automator services](http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/index.html) equivalent? With some more details you might also show one extension you like from Windows and ask how to re-implement it on OS X. <comment93255> I added an example, thanks. <comment93256> If your just looking for new contextual menu items. Automator services are THE best solution for you.
