upscaling videos on iMac 5k with VLC (or other player) - just enlarge the window? <body> I have lots of old videos with low resolution. For example:  precodeID                                       : 1 Format                                   : MPEG-4 Visual Format profile                           : Simple@L4a Format settings, BVOP                    : No Format settings, QPel                    : No Format settings, GMC                     : No warppoints Format settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263) Codec ID                                 : 20 Duration                                 : 1 min 46 s Bit rate mode                            : Variable Bit rate                                 : 2 743 kb/s Nominal bit rate                         : 4 000 kb/s Maximum bit rate                         : 3 000 kb/s Width                                    : 640 pixels Height                                   : 480 pixels Display aspect ratio                     : 4:3 Frame rate mode                          : Variable Frame rate                               : 28.508 FPS Minimum frame rate                       : 2.097 FPS Maximum frame rate                       : 40.816 FPS Color space                              : YUV Chroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0 Bit depth                                : 8 bits Scan type                                : Progressive Compression mode                         : Lossy Bits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.313 /code/pre  I play them with VLC. To upscale the video I just make the window bigger. Is there any better way? Is there any macOS Sierra software providing better upscaling experience of legacy videos?  <answer271583> The fundamental problem is that your sources are low quality and going to a larger, higher resolution screen is just going to make them look more crummy than on a lower res, smaller screen unless you actually process the videos. You can try interpolating the sources but it's a long process and probably not worth it. The best option is XMedia Recode. You can thank me later ;)  <comment341379> The unfortunate answer is there is nothing you can really do if I understand you correctly. <comment341383> XMedia Recode is only available for Windows? <comment341391> Yep, but I don't believe there's a freeware for mac that does the same thing. Any old win PC can run it. <comment341445> Yeah, I think the simplest solution is to sit further away & not wear your glasses. [I'm only half joking, there's really not a lot you can do to seamlessly upscale so far, nothing worth the effort anyway] VLC is going to do a 'fair' job of it on the fly.
