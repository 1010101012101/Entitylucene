ATTO manufactures PCIe cards for Mac Pro desktops to connect external storage systems and other devices. I would check in `/Library/Preferences/` and `~/Library/Preferences` for these 5 .plist files and move them to a temporary location on your desktop. If the install is successful, delete them. <comment220129> @IconDaemon These files created by osx installer in `/System/Library/Extensions` directory on ssd drive, how should I delete these files in installing process?
