Is it possible to upgrade a Mac Pro (2007) with Lion (10.7) to Yosemite (10.10)? <body> I have a MacPro (mid-2007) with the configuration listed below:  ul liProcessor: 2x 2.66Ghz Dual Core Intel Xeon/li liMemory: 20Gb 667Mhz - DDR2 FB-DIMM/li liOSx: Lion 10.7.5/li liNVIDIA Chip Model 1024Mb/li liSSD: 512Gb/li liHD2: 1Tb/li liHD3: 1Tb/li liHD4: 500Gb/li /ul  I've been searching how to upgrade to Yosemite directly, but I found he is not compatible anymore (only MacPro 2008 / later). There's a way to hack/workaround this problem? And why I can't upgrade my Lion to Yosemite if the hardware specs are totally compatible?  <answer234116> OK, this might be somewhat opinion-based, however...  Possible, yes.br Worth it, no.  strongPossible/strongbr There are tools &amp; online guides far too long to repro or précis here on how to achieve it. It requires hacking the firmware &amp; needs re-hacking at each update -br These guides from MacRumors are as good as they get, one for Yosemite &amp; another for El Capitan.  strongWorth it?/strongbr The 1,1 &amp; 2,1 are really end-of-life &amp; now very slow compared to a 'modern' machine.br I really guess it depends on your budget, but you can get an absolute top-flight 5,1 [or the smart money goes on a 4,1 with the Apple upgrade kit] with two 6-core hyperthreading Xeons @3.46GHz &amp; 64GB RAM for under £1800 in the UK. Your existing drives will just carry over [though idk about the OS itself, mine did from a 3,1 to 5,1].br The Geekbench scores on those are about 32k, that's slightly under the current top model 'trash-can' at 33k. I just checked the score for the 2.66 Mac Pro, 6k.  I took the latter path, even though I was only moving up from a 3,1 - which is now in the hands of my partner &amp; very happily running El Capitan. I wanted a speed boost &amp; the upgraded 4,1 was right on the money for me.  <comment286172> Surely you have a spare hard drive sitting around, now that they're $50 a TB or so? I'd suck it and see. Or have you, and it says **NO**? You used to be able to find machine spec spoofing software out there, but I haven't looked since the early aughts. <comment286177> Have you tried Google? Have a look at [how to install an unsupported version of os x](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=how+to+install+and+unsupported+version+of+os+x&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#q=how+to+install+an+unsupported+version+of+os+x) <comment286184> Not strictly true @DavidAnderson It's not the Xeon that makes the difference, it's the 32-bit underpinning. From the 3,1 [2008] onwards El Capitan runs perfectly well, but the 1,1 & 2,1 need some unofficial tweaking. The last official OS for those early Mac Pros is 10.7.5. I have a friend who did tweak one up from the online guides, but decided it wasn't actually worth the effort :/ <comment286189> @Tetsujin: You are right. I deleted my comment. <comment286929> So you managed to install osx 10.11 on the 3.1 pro?? <comment286930> The 3,1 needs no 'hack', it's still directly compatible. If you're looking at a newer machine, though, I'd skip the 3,1 & go straight for the 5 or upgraded 4. At current prices they're a better bet.
