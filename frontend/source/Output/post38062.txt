Is there a keyboard shortcut to clear the search box in Lion's Mail? <body> I am running 10.7.2 and would like to be able to clear the search box in Mail with a shortcut. How do I do this?  <answer38071> If the focus is on the search box press "esc" key. If not, the fastest way I've found is by first pressing Option+Command+F to set the focus on the search box and then press esc to clear it.  This is a link to apple standard shorcuts: Mac OS X Shorcuts  <answer210723> I love Keyboard Maestro for this kind of stuff (and in general). I've bound cmd-shift-delete to a macro that clears the search box. Here's the macro. I'd add a screenshot but don't have the required reputation yet.  <comment43128> Perfect, thank you.
