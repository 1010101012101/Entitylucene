Can I boot from any USB DVD drive or only the SuperDrive <body> I went to Curry's today which is a electronics retailer and bought a Mac mini. I wanted to buy a HP DVD Drive to boot from (for system repairs, Linux, Windows, GParted) I asked the store assistant if the drive was bootable and they said only the SuperDrive can be used for booting   Is this true?  The HP drive in question is called "HP F6V97AA External Slimline USB DVD Writer - Black"  <comment237389> no it is not correct. <comment237390> @Buscar웃SD are you sure of this, have you tried this particular drive, or do drives in general tend to work. If in general, which particular drive do you know to work? Thanks <comment237391> and you do have bootable dvd's ? <comment237392> @Buscar웃SD yes, why? <comment237393> Then there is no problem. This days one would use USB sticks (10 Gb each for the OS) to do that, since the DVD is not rewritable with updated operating system and it is cheaper then your DVD drive. <comment237429> A "SuperDrive", btw, is pretty much any Pioneer drive - I replaced my old PATA one with an SATA for about 15 bucks, inc postage [would be slightly more for an external, or buy a hot-swap generic USB dock] - PIONEER DVD-RW  DVR-221L
