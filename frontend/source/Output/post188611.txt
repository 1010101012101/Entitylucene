Windows not updating folders from the OS X drive <body> I have installed Windows 8.1 on my MBP through Bootcamp. Sometimes I encounter a strange issue:  ul liLog into OS X, and move/delete/create some files, e.g. codeDesktop\test_file.txt/code/li liTurn off the machine;/li liTurn on again (even after hours) and boot into Windows;/li liLook into codeD:/Users/user/Desktop/code, and there's no codetest_file.txt/code in it! I can see all other files, but the new entry is not there./li /ul  This happens very often, and to get things working I have to log into OS X, do nothing, and log again into Windows (which is quite annoying).  Does any of you know why? I'm looking for a workaround for, when in Windows, "refreshing" the codeD:/code contents without having to reboot two times.  I have tried with no success:  ol liActually clicking "Refresh" in the file manager;/li liMove to codeD:/Users/user/Desktop/code from the command line. Can see all that was before, but no codetest_file.txt/code./li /ol  <answer188633> My experience with Windows 8.1 and Yosemite is the HFS+ drivers installed in Windows do not work very well. In defense of Apple, I have a 2007 iMac and Windows 8.1 is not approved for my model.  I assume you are not using Core Storage. If so, you could try the free drivers from Paragon. See link HFS+ for WindowsÂ® 8/8.1 Free Edition  Note: You can test for Core Storage by opening a Terminal application window and entering the following command.  precodediskutil  cs  list /code/pre  If you are not using Core Storage, the result will be  precodeNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found /code/pre  <answer188640> I found my answer here. The culprit is Windows Fast Startup, that actually hibernates the file structure when turning off, and restores it when re-booting in.  Thus any changes happened between these two steps can't be really percieved by Windows. From what I read, it could even bring to data loss (if only it had write permissions towards my HFS+).  So, either you disable it, or you stick with the problem (but be sure not to have write permissions!). You should also make sure to unmount any external drive before hibernating / turning off Windows, otherwise there's real risk you'll be losing data.  Personally I'm gonna disable it.  <comment223328> Nope I'm using HFS+. <comment223329> Oh, thought the drivers were for CoreStorage. So I could use them. But.. I don't feel comfortable using free drivers from a company that is offering paid support in the same page, honestly. Looks like you're gonna have some issue in a short time. <comment223331> FYI, Core Storage is a way to partitioning you disk(s). Core Storage volumes usually are formatted HFS+. In your case, I doubt you are using Core Storage because you can already read HFS+ from Windows. What Paragon is also offering the ability to **write** to HFS+ from Windows. The free version only works for Windows 8/8.1. Paid version work with all versions of Windows including Windows 10. <comment223332> I just found and posted my answer. Thank you anyway.
