Use Tor on another laptop as a proxy for Safari <body> here is the thing: I have the Tor browser on my laptop number one, and I would like to use it as a "proxy" (hope I'm using the word correctly) for my laptop number two.  What I have tried: I was already successful to do a somewhat similar thing on a single computer, which was going to Firefox settings and setting up a SOCKS proxy with host IP address 127.0.0.1 and port 9150, so that Firefox was using Tor as a "proxy".  So, inspired by that my most naive idea was to go to network preferences on laptop number two, set up a SOCKS proxy, and set the host IP address 198.162.0.1 (the IP address of laptop number one) and port 9150, and obviously it didn't work.  Laptop number one is running Ubuntu and laptop number is running El Capitan.
