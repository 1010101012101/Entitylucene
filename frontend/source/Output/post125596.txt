Calendar facebook events <body> I am on Mavericks and have my facebook account set up correctly as i get notifications for new comments and messages but for some reason the calendar app wont get my facebook events.  I am presented with "Enter the password for “my@email.com” in System Preferences.  My password is right as the other notifications work and everything seems to work on my iphone.  Any idea how to fix this?  <answer125612> Not sure you did this but  ul liGo to System preferences /li liOpen Internet Accounts/li liPick Facebook/li liIn the new window check the Calender/li liin the same window Click on Details and enter your credentials./li liNew Calender will show up in your Calender app/li liFacebook Events/li /ul  That should be it.  <comment146980> How did you set up your Facebook account?
