Where are TextEdit files that are not moved to iCloud Drive stored? <body> After upgrading to Yosemite I did not migrate to iCloud Drive and iCloud text files were in a local folder which was very difficult to locate.   I can't find these files now. They were in a folder that had a long "com.open" or similar name.  <answer180773> If you haven't migrated to iCloud Documents then they are still stored in the iCloud Documents folder in  precode~/Library/Mobile Documents/com.apple.textedit/ /code/pre  <comment214796> Did you save them in the cloud before, or why were they in such a folder? <comment217738> I did not migrate but they were removed in an upgrade. I found them using Timecapsule backup.
