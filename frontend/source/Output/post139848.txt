Applescript System Events Keystroke broken after 10.9.4 <body> It seems like the recent Mavericks update has broken the keystroke command in applescript -- whenever my script reaches that point, it freezes. (I currently have ~20 zombie osascript processes...)  Furthermore, there isn't anything in the accessibility options to allow applescripts to automate keystrokes.  This is my script currently.  precodetell application "Terminal"     activate end tell delay 0.1 tell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal"     keystroke "t" using command down end tell tell application "Terminal"     do script "cd ~/some_folder_here" in front window end tell /code/pre  If there's a way to tell terminal to directly open a tab (or if iterm 2 can do that) that could also be a solution.  <answer140365> It turns out that the System Events process on my machine was frozen (which I discovered after a node process refused to be killed). Performing a full restart fixed the problem.  <comment164810> Just tried your AppleScript here on 10.9.4 and it successfully brings Terminal to the foreground and opens a new tab.
