Export All Photos from iPhoto into Album Folders <body> Is there anyway to export an iphoto library and use the album name for the subfolder format? Using the event name will not be of much use to me. I tried running this script and it did nothing. https://github.com/BMorearty/exportiphoto  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MR4dy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment341235> Also I should mention the computer is running macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and is a late 2012 MacBook Pro.
