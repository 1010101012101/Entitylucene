Macbook pro retina taking too much time to wake from sleep <body> My MacBook Pro Retina 13" late 2012 sometimes is taking more than 30 minutes to get back from sleep. Normally takes up to 10 minutes but often takes more than 30 minutes. Has anyone faced or have a fix for that?   Notes:    ul liIt begin about two years from purchase date. (12/22/2012)/li liBattery with capacity in 50% with message "Need to replace soon..."/li /ul  Already tried:   ul liReset PRAM and SMC/li liSet PMSET and standbymode to 0/li liFormatting/li liUpdate and downgrades until leopard version(It occurs in all version since leopard)/li /ul  <comment335090> *It begin about two years from purchase date.*  That doesn't help as we don't know when you purchased it.  When did it start using today as a reference point?  When it started, what were you doing at the time?  That said, 10 mins is still too long.  It sounds like your sleep image is getting corrupt.  I would fix the battery first. <comment335092> If you've connected this MBP to many wireless networks, try removing all the saved networks by going to `System Preferences  Network  Advanced ...`, then select all the Preferred Wifi networks in the list one-by-one and delete them with the minus sign button. Alternatively, you can make sure the Wifi network you most commonly use is at the top of the list by dragging. Additionally, Wifi networks are collected in the iCloud keychain from other devices you use which connect to Wifi and are attached to your iCloud account. This can increase the count of Preferred Wifi networks. <comment335095> @Allan added purchase date. If te sleep image is getting corrupted what may cause that and how to fix it? Already set a date to replace the battery. <comment335098> So, you've had this problem for 2 years now?  There's sleep and hibernate.  Sleep keeps things in memory while hibernate writes those contents to drive.  If your battery is failing it is possible that the file doesn't get written completely before the power runs out.  When you turn it back on, it has to rebuild. <comment335188> @Allan Yes, two years. I'll replace and come to tell you. <comment335189> @IconDaemo If I delete the wifi networks from System preferentes it will be erased from icloud keychan too? <comment335258> I don't think they will be deleted from the keychain.
