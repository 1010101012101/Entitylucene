can't add contacts keyboard is missing <body> I have an iphone 4.  I went to add a contact and my keyboard will not pop up.  Thus I cannot add or search contacts by name.  How can I fix this?  <answer134644> First of all, reboot your phone and give a try once.  or   Try to add a contact from both dial pad and contacts. Hope one works among the two.  <comment159276> screenshot please <comment159324> Have you tried rebooting the phone? <comment196256> I had the same problem just now, restarting the phone fixed it, thank you!
