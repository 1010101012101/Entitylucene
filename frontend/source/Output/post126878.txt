Can an Airport Express extend a non-Apple wifi network, wirelessly? <body> Can I use an Airport Express to extend my wifi network if my current wifi network doesn't have any other Apple access points on it. I wish to extend wirelessly, without a wired connection between the Airport Express and the network.  <comment148633> That can not be done. <comment148637> It depends on what your primary base station supports and if it allows such a feature. Some base stations require their own hardware to extend the network so please post what kind of wireless hardware you currently have (make and model). <comment148856> @AndrewU. I hoped to use an Amped Wireless AP20000G as the access point that it connects to. If I must I could use another Airport Express as the access point to extend from, but I'd prefer not to.
