How to type in Mac window? <body> I want to enter a simple adb shell command, so I navigated to code...\sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe/code, and opened it. However, I am unable to type in it!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/48ZQw.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am a new Mac user after recently moving from Windows, and am unsure why I can't type in the adb. What's wrong?  <answer233032> By clicking on a unix executable, you run it with the exit argument.  If you scroll up to the top you will see something like this:  precode.../Development/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20140702/sdk/platform-tools/adb ; exit; /code/pre  The way to run a shell tool is to open terminal (hit command+space and type Terminal then enter) then something like:  precodecd /wherever/you/have installed/your sdk/platform-tools/ ./adb shell /code/pre  tip: start typing the directory name then hit tab for completion  <answer233033> Firstly, Macs run embinaries/em and not code.exe/code files.  This codeadb/code is a binary, and must take options.   Open Terminal, from code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/code and you should see something like this (colors should be different): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l8vno.png" alt="You should see something like this."  Now, type in codeadb/code and press kbdreturn/kbd. You should see the same output as you saw in your screenshot. Now, to run the command (the highlighted text in the background), copy (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd) and paste (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdV/kbd) that text into the terminal window. Everything that follows codeadb/code are called "arguments", like modifiers that affect what the command does. This is quite common in shell commands.  precode   adb shell pm clear com.android.vending   |-V-||---------------V-----------------|  Command            Arguments /code/pre  Alternatively, if you have a binary in a specific location, do: (code.//code executes a binary)  precodecd /path/to/the/binary ./binary-name (arguments) /code/pre  Side note: autocompletion can be very helpful in long directory names: by typing in a fragment of a name, then hitting kbdTab/kbd, autocompletion will fill in the rest of the fragment (assuming there are no similarly named items). Pressing kbdTab/kbd twice will show you what autocompletion can fill in.  precode$ cd /Users/Ha *presses tab* $ cd /Users/Harry/  OR  $ cd /Users/H *presses tab twice* Harry/ Henry/ Hagrid/ $ cd /Users/H /code/pre  <comment284951> Hey, I really loved your descriptive answer. I navigated to my `platform-tools` directory, which contains my `adb.exe`, and tried to type in `adb` and `adb shell`. However, I got: `command not found`. What should I do? Here is a screenshot: <comment284952> http://imgur.com/HkvFg4g <comment284953> To run a binary, it is simply the name of the executable prepended by a `./`. In your case, that would be: `./adb shell`. Also, it is important to note that the executable inside that folder **is not a .exe file**, but rather a *binary*. <comment284954> To attend to your "command not found" problem, that is due to the binary not being inside your `$PATH` directory, the paths that your computer looks in for binaries. Try `echo $PATH` in the Terminal, where you should see multiple paths. These paths are where commands should be placed to be called by just their name.  Try moving your `adb` binary into `/usr/local/bin` and just calling `adb` from the main command line. <comment284958> I am unable to paste into `bin`: http://imgur.com/IRoPBO9 <comment284962> Make sure it's `/usr/local/bin`. Try Cmd+C Cmd+V instead of drag/drop.
