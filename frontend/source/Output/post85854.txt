iPhone 4 with iOS 6.1.2 won't do a restore backup <body> I have had to restore the firmware to 6.1.2 but it won't do a restore of my backup file. I carried out a backup prior to installing the new firmware that was successful. I also have the latest version of iTunes. I'm using iTunes not iCloud for the restore. Help please.  <comment98962> Can you add some details about the "won't" part? What are you trying to do specifically and how, what is the result? Screenshots also help to provide details. <comment98965> What are you trying to achieve?
