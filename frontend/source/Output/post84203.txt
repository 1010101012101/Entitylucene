Delete key does not work in TextEdit <body> When I select a piece of text on TextEdit and try to delete it using the delete key the piece of text does not get deleted. But, if I tap my trackpad strongafter/strong hitting the delete key, it does.  I've tried the same thing on TextMate and everything works fine there. So, why is this happening? And, how can I make it work again?  I am using strongMountain Lion/strong with the latest updates.
