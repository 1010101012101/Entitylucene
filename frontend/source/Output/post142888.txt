Moving terminal version of python to homebrew version <body> codepython -V/code shows that I am on 2.7.7 but codebrew upgrade python/code shows I have 2.7.8 so clearly my terminal isn't looking at the Homebrew version. How do I fix this?  <answer142889> Check if code/usr/local/bin/code is in your PATH and that it's before code/usr/bin/code. In the terminal:  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  I believe codebrew doctor/code will warn you about this if it's not. Basically, if it's not, the system will look in code/usr/bin/code first instead of code/usr/local/bin/code, which is where homebrew links everything.  For bash, you just need to add:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH /code/pre  to your code~/.bash_profile/code file.  <comment168312> $ which python returns /usr/local/bin/python so now I'm really confused. <comment168313> That's odd, it's definitely not using the system python since that's only version 2.7.5 in Mavericks. Does `ls -l /usr/local/bin/python` point to `../Cellar/python/2.7.8/bin/python` ? <comment168316> No its pointing to 2.7.7 How can I make it point to the correct place? <comment168321> I just removed 2.7.7 from the Cellar and dealt with it that way... <comment168325> Yeah, for some reason it must not have linked properly when you upgraded. `brew unlink python && brew link python` may also have worked. <comment168329> @Joe run `brew doctor` to check for any `caveats`. run `brew cleanup` as well.
