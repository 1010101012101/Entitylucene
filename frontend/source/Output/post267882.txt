How to prevent iPhone from vibrating during calls? <body> I can't figure out how to prevent my iPhone SE (iOS 10.2) from vibrating when messages arrive while I'm on a call (that is, it vibrates right into my ear). This happens regularly, and I'm sure it occurs with other models/software versions.  I cannot find any setting regulating this, therefore it looks like a major bug: it doesn't have any function and interferes with the normal phone usage.  Does anybody know if anything has been/is being done with respect to this issue?  <answer267884> I believe you need to look in Settings  Sounds &amp; Haptics.   In there you have various settings for Sound and Vibrate. Under the section "Sounds and Vibration Patterns" there's a "Text Tone" option. If you touch that, you have options for what happens when you receive a Text, both Sound and Haptics. One of the options for Haptics is "None"  <comment336194> Thank you, I believe that changes general settings for when text are received. What I'm looking for is for a way to disable the vibration only during calls, when I the vibrating device (the phone) is right at my ear <comment336195> In that case, i believe this link may help:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/93590/stop-iphone-alerting-me-when-im-in-a-phone-call
