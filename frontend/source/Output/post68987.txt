Which USB keyboards will work with an iPad 3? <body> It is possible to connect a USB keyboard to an iPad (3rd generation) using the camera connection kit.   However, my Apple keyboard does not work so which ones do?   Yes I know I could buy a wireless keyboard.  <answer69463> Yes you can, but it doesn't seem to work under the new iOS6.
