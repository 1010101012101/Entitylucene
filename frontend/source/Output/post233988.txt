Ext HDD won't mount <body> I have several Ext. HDD attached via USB to my iMac. Turning the mac on this morning three of the four drives mount no problem. (all in the same ext power / usb tower) but one drive does not mount.  I went into Disk Utility and the drive shows up there but it's child shows up greyed out. When I select the child it shows that I can mount it but when I actually hit the mount button nothing else happens. The button does not show unmount but stays as mount. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LeyiG.png" alt="enter image description here"  It shows the child as being all yellow (other) but its far from full.  Can anyone help ?  Many thanks all  Is this what you need ? If not let me know, thanks for your help.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bokQI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  precodeDevice Identifier:        disk3s2    Device Node:              /dev/disk3s2    Whole:                    No    Part of Whole:            disk3    Device / Media Name:      E Drive     Volume Name:                   Mounted:                  No     File System Personality:  HFS+    Type (Bundle):            hfs    Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended    Journal:                  Unknown (not mounted)    Owners:                   Disabled     Partition Type:           Apple_HFS    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 USB    SMART Status:             Not Supported    Disk / Partition UUID:    BB43A59F-CA7A-407B-A912-89CA19F5C00C     Total Size:               999.9 GB (999860912128 Bytes) (exactly 1952853344 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        0 B (0 Bytes) (exactly 0 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (not mounted)     Device Location:          External    Removable Media:          No /code/pre  Like that ?  It didn't mount :o(  precodeLast login: Thu Apr  7 08:40:46 on ttys000 Pauls-iMac:~ pual$ diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk3 One or more volume(s) failed to mount Pauls-iMac:~ pual$  /code/pre  <answer234180> In my experience, this is a clear cut hardware issue. If you cannot mount the volume, even after trying to do so forcibly, itâ€™s almost always due to physical failure of the hard drive disk.   You can test with varied USB connections (different cable, then different hub) to eliminate the alternatives and confirm the diagnosis. Best of luck.  <comment286000> Could you please post the information of `diskutil list` and `diskutil info /dev/diskxsz` where `diskxsz` is the disk device identifier (left column lowest field in DU) of said partition `Untitled` to your question? <comment286051> Not sure if this is what you are asking if not let me know. Thanks for your reply. <comment286069> try `diskutil info /dev/disk3s2` instead. Also, you can format the terminal output as code by indenting plain text four spaces *or* selecting all code and clicking the `{}` button. <comment286096> @perhapsmaybeharry is that helpful ? <comment286098> Yep, great. From this information I can conclude that your drive is formatted correctly, and should not have any problems mounting. Ironically, it's having problems mounting. I would suggest you try `diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk3` and see if that gives any errors. <comment286100> @perhapsmaybeharry No Luck <comment286102> did it mount, or did it throw an error? <comment286104> It came back with :  One or more volume(s) failed to mount <comment286109> Okay, try `diskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk3`. <comment286110> All seems ok there :diskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk3 Started partition map verification on disk3 Checking prerequisites Checking the partition list Checking the partition map size Checking for an EFI system partition Checking the EFI system partition's size Checking the EFI system partition's file system Checking the EFI system partition's folder content Checking all HFS data partition loader spaces Checking booter partitions Checking Core Storage Physical Volume partitions The partition map appears to be OK Finished partition map verification on disk3 <comment286111> This makes no sense.. The file system seems to be in order. Have you tried switching the USB ports? Alternatively try `diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk3s2` and see if that brings up anything <comment286112> Yer thats what I thought, I will give your suggestions a go now. <comment286113> I can only specify whole disk it says so using disk3 it then warns that the partition map might erase disk3s1. Is it safe to continue anyway ? <comment286114> In regards to using my other USB ports my other three disks seem to work ok with the current USB port. Maybe I should move the disks position in the ext caddy ? <comment286115> Yes, it's safe. `disk3s1` is the EFI partition. As per the USB ports, have you checked the connectors of the faulty disk itself? I wouldn't suspect it's a connectivity issue though. <comment286120> @njboot I feared so, but if verifyDisk can be maintained I would think it has a bit of life left in it <comment286190> Guys you've been very helpful. I'm going to sort another HDD and see if I can get someone to retrieve the files from the disk3. Thanks again cheers <comment328274> Pretty much the same issue. Were you able to find a solution to this? <comment331925> Pretty much the same issue. Were you able to find a solution to this?
