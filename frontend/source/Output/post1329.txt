With Pages '08, can I add a top border to a title? <body> I'm writing my resume with Pages, and I'd like to know if (and how) I can add a horizontal line across the page before every text segment with a certain style (namely, "Header", though that shouldn't matter).  Will I necessarily have to draw a straight line myself, and move it around each time a section enlarges?  <answer4668> This is possible in Pages '09, so it probably works in Pages '08 as well.  ol liSelect a heading in your document/li liOpen the Inspector (in menu bar click View - Show Inspector)  ol liSelect the Text section/li liSelect the "More" tab/li liUnder "Borders &amp; Rules", click the dropdown that says "none" and select the line you want to use/li liBelow the dropdown select the icon depicting the line above the content img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vbA4E.png" alt="alt text"/li /ol/li liOpen the Styles Drawer (in menu bar click View - Show Styles Drawer)  ol liSince the text is still selected, the heading you're using should already be highlighted/li liClick the arrow beside the style/li liClick "Redefine style from selection" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rEWc.png" alt="alt text"/li /ol/li /ol  Now everywhere that you used that heading will now have a horizontal line over it, and it will automatically appear whenever you insert new headings.   <comment1141> Can you post a small screen shot of your layout? <comment4531> Seems like I missed it. Thanks! <comment4532> @zneak Sure thing, I hope the answer is still useful
