Mac App Store Won't Open on Macbook Pro <body> For the past few weeks my Mac App Store hasn't been loading correctly. Occasionally it does, but i'd say this has only been once or twice in the last month.  Here's a link of what it looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Buqp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, anyone now how I can install Yosemite without going into the App Store?  <answer223083> First, close the app store or itunes, etc.  I fixed this by opening a terminal, then getting a super user terminal: sudo su - enter your password now be careful. You are root.  Next we want to kill all the App Store related processes.  This doesn't hurt anything.  Let's find them using the ps command and then using the grep search utility to get down to what we want.  precodeMacBook-Pro:~ root# ps -ef |grep store |grep -vi google   501  9284     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:08.90 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storeassetd   501  9349     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:00.73 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storeinappd   501  9353     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:01.91 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storedownloadd   501  9459     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:00.17 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storelegacy /code/pre  The second column is the process ID we want.  We want to use the kill command:  precodekill 9284 9349 9353 9459 /code/pre  The numbers will be different on your PC.  Open up app store and it should work! I have also read other ways - removing some verisign keys from the key chain app, and others, but this is what fixed me.  <comment353312> Is this on genuine apple hardware?  I've seen this behavior on VMs where the serial number was set by VMware to longer than 12 characters.
