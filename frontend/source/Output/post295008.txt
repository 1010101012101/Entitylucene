How to give the Guest User permission to run a specific application <body> I have an app that, just for safety, I only want to run under the Guest Account.  That way it won't have access to any of my files.  But when I try to run it from there I get an error:  precodeYou do not have permission to open application... Contact your computer or network administrator for assistance. /code/pre  (I always hate that last line.  emI/em am the sole owner of this machine, so why isn't it telling emme/em what I need to do?!)  How do I give the guest user permission?  I have already disabled parental control and have ensured the application directory is executable for all users.  FileVault is emnot/em enabled.  I have read that it may be necessary to answer a prompt about whether or not to install an application for all users or just the current user, but there was no installation process - it's just a ".app/" directory containing the application that I double-click on.  I tried recursively changing ownership of the directory to root.  I also compared the Finder permissions to that of an app that the guest account emcan/em open (Safari).  There I notice two things I can't figure out how to replicate:  first, it has two "everyone" entries, but when I go to add a second instance of "everyone" it doesn't provide that choice.  Second, the second instance of "everyone" has "custom" privilege which first of all, it won't tell me what that means, and second, it doesn't offer that option for the app I am trying to fix.  I also tried codesudo spctl --master-disable/code on my admin account, but that didn't fix it either.  <comment372684> downvoter care to comment on how i can improve this question?
