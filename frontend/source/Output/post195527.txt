Error message when adding Calendar Event <body> When adding a New Event to Calendar on the iPhone6, I get an error message "Cannot Save Event - That event does not belong to that event store." How are events suppose to be added to the calendar?  <answer195530> You provided very little information, like what account (iCloud, Google Calendar, etc.) you are trying to add an event to. I suggest signing out of that account in codeSettings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars/code and then signing in again.
