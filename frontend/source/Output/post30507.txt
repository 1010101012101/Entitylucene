MD5 checksum on multiple file? <body> I have files like this.  precodemd1.gz md1.gz.md5 md2.gz md2.gz.md5 .... md300.gz md300.gz.md /code/pre  Is there any application (or command line) to check the md5 of all files ?  EDIT: Currently I use cfv from macport. work great without any modification  <answer30514> The codemd5/code command will check multiple files for you. Simply list all the files you want after the command. I.e. codemd5 md1.gz md2.gz md3.gz/code. It will output the md5 hashes like so:  precodeMD5 (md1.gz) = 1c2c02b085a1bc2fed683eca86c0df02 MD5 (md1.gz) = c5515451d8f90a822457a4a8e4bf1791 /code/pre  If you want just the hashes, use the code-q/code flag, it will print only the hash, without the identifying information.  I'm guessing that you want to compare the hash of the files against that in the corresponding .md5 file. You could write a quick shell script to check each generated hash against the one stored in the .md5 file.  Something like this should work:  precode#!/bin/bash  for file in "$@"; do   generatedhash=$(md5 -q "$file")   storedhash=$(&lt; "$file".md5)   if [[ $generatedhash != $storedhash ]]; then     echo "Hash for file '$file 'does not match"   fi done /code/pre  Save that to a text file, call it something like checkmd5.sh and do codechmod +x checkmd5.sh/code in the terminal.  It will print out a warning for all files that don't have a matching hash. It prints nothing if the hashes do match. It's quick and dirty, so apologies if it doesn't work for your particular case. But based on the examples you gave, if you run code./checkmd5.sh md*.gz/code it should check the hashes of the .gz files against the corresponding .md5 files and tell you if any are bad.  <answer31602> If want to use a gui, you can try with ff_md5drop  <answer36828> md5deep is a great cross platform tool to generate and check md5/sha hashes. While it's easy to replicate the recursive hash generation feature in a few lines of shell code, it's not so easy to do that for its hash matching feature.  http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/start-md5deep.html#install  <answer216956> Maybe my own product will help you.br fHash https://github.com/sunjw/fhashbr An open source files' hash calculator for Windows and Mac OS X.  ul liMD5, SHA1, SHA256 and CRC32./li liDrag &amp; drop./li liIntegrated with context menu in Explorer/Finder./li liSupport multiple files./li /ul  <comment34991> I remember using "something" in linux box to do a hash check with multiple file but I can't remember so I wonder if osx have the same thing. <comment34994> Glad it's what you're looking for.

I just came across this question, and I think fHash which is my own product is useful for this situation. And answers above mine are all just a tool's link. So why you don't flag them? <comment262271> Did you read my link? You need to disclose any affiliation to product. <comment262272> In general, answers which show *how* a specific product can be used to solve the specific problem described in the question tend to get better votes than answers which just link to a product together with a generic text. This is especially valid if you promote your own product.
