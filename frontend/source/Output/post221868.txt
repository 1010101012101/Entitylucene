EFI and SMC firmware updates - how to determine if the downloadable version is more recent? <body> I have a 15-inch MacBook Pro late 2011. System Information gives me the following firmware versions:  strongEFI Boot Rom Version/strong: MBP81.0047.B2C  strongSMC Version (system)/strong:   1.69f3  Apple provides the following web site for downloading firmware upgrades: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201518  On this website the following downloads are available for my system:  strongEFI Boot ROM version/strong: MBP81.0047.2AB (2015-001)   strongSMC version/strong: 1.69f3 (SMC 1.5)  The SMC version is the same as the one installed on my system, so no need to update anything.  However, there is a discrepancy with regard to the EFI Boot ROM versions (installed MBP81.0047.B2C vs. MBP81.0047.2AB). How can I tell whether the ...2AB version is a newer version than the ...B2C version on my system? Will the upgrade programme check during the upgrade process?  I   <answer221870> The updater program will check to see if you already have the latest version of the Firmware.  Taken directly from the Apple web page that you linked to:     If you try to use a manual updater that's not designed for your Mac,   or if it's not needed, the installer alerts you and the software isn't   installed   <comment268709> What version of the Mac OS are you running?
