How to make an alias link to a Windows server folder <body> On our server (windows 2012) we have a folder for Scan files called server/scans/(username). I know how to setup link from windows PC so that user can access the scans. How do I setup the same thing on a Mac Pro notebook?   I understand Apple calls shortcuts as alias. Before I'd just start a shortcut and type in IP address to setup path. How do I do this on the Mac?  <answer126547> You can go to the Finder Preferences then tick 'Connected Servers' under "Show these items on the desktop."  This worked for me.  <answer126560> You can drag the Folder to your dock (between the trash and the sepperator to the applications), or to the sidebar in Finder.   You can also create an Alias (this is what you need to do if you want to put it in a folder or to the desktop) by dragging the folder and holding zhe alt-key (a small arrow will appear in the lower left of the icon).
