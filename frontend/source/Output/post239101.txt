Apple Iphone 4s updated will not work <body> I just received an update on Apple iPhone 4S.  I downloaded now it shows the iTunes logo and charger on iPhone.  Please help did everything I can find on the internet and still does not work.  This is the same thing I was trying to say except mine is a 4s https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/171087/184354 I did everything asked but nothing works.  Also, it said to turn off with the slider my slider does not come up.  Any help??  <answer239113> The screen you are describing indicates a phone that is in recovery mode. Recovery mode occurs when an update is unable to install properly or is corrupted. The only way to get your phone to be functional again is to plug it into your computer, open iTunes, and follow the prompts that show up to "restore" your phone. Restoring is the process of installing the newest software on the phone and resetting it to factory settings.
