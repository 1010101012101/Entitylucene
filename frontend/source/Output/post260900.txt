Trying to Connect a PANHAI Branded PS3 Controller, disconnects every 20 seconds or so, fix? <body> so i've been trying to connect this Chinese made Controller via bluetooth, and it seems that it disconnects every half a minute or so, tried searching for solutions and came with this :  Anyone able to connect gioteck VX-1 (PS3 controller) via Bluetooth?  it has similar context to my problem, and this guy confirms that it also works on Chinese made Dualshock Controllers : https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/1041 (Thread number 6)  i already did all of the steps necessary on both thread, but can't seem to connect my controller over and over again, i did connect it to my Mac for 1 hour and i'm pretty sure it's already 1/3 charged  the threads above shows that the problem has been solved in Mavericks, but now i am using a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) Mac OS X Sierra 10.12  can anybody help me?, if you need more details about my Macbook pro then just ask
