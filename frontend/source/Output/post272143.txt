How should I use Two Step and/or Two Factor authentication with many Apple accounts? <body> I have the following accounts  ul liA personal iCloud account that secures my keychain / Facetime/li liA personal iTunes account/li liA work developer account for the App Store (not shared, I exclusively use it)/li /ul  strongQuestion/strong  How can I enable Two Step, or Two Factor for strongmore than one/strong accounts above?  strongBackground/strong  I have a mid-2012 Retina, a 2016 MacBook Pro, Watch 2, and iPhone 7.  I use the same iCloud account on all devices, therefore I can only use strongtwo factor/strong authentication for one account listed above.  When I try to reenabled "two step" authentication for the other accounts, I don't see the option anymore within the idmsa portal.  How do I enable either 2 step, or 2 factor in the above scenarios?  <answer290379> You should be able to enable two-step authentication for the iTunes account by going to appleid.apple.com and logging in on that account. It's an option under the Security section. I just did this (and I have a similar setup to yours) and it works. You won't be able to use the option of allowing notifications to be sent to devices using Find my iPhone, since they are presumably using your iCloud account. The developer account I'm afraid I can't help on.  It would certainly be nice if we could enable two-factor authentication instead, but I can't find any way to do that.  <comment342080> You can hook up 2FA to your phone number and receive codes as texts for multiple accounts on the same iPhone. <comment342081> @owlswipe I no longer see that option under the security tab
