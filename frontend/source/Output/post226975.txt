How to create a FAT16 partition on an SD card with OS X El Capitan? <body> I want to prepare an SD card for use in an old camera using CHDK. The card needs to be FAT16 formatted. This doesnâ€™t work from Terminal anymore, maybe already for years. Disk Utility provides ''FAT'', but this is FAT32. I have no other (Windows) computer. What do I do?  <answer226979> h2You can format any drive to FAT16 with codenewfs_msdos/code Command/h2  strong1) Launch Terminal/strong  strong2) Find The Drive you Want to Format/strong  precode#mount /dev/disk2 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) /dev/disk4s1 on /Volumes/USB_Disk (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners) /code/pre  In this case, my disk is disk4.  strongYour disk will most likely be different!  Be sure to reference the correct disk - you can and will lose your data if you format the wrong drive!!!/strong  strong3) Unmount the disk/strong  precode#diskutil unmountDisk disk4 Unmount of all volumes on disk4 was successful /code/pre  strong4)  Format the drive/strong   precode#sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 /dev/disk4 /code/pre  After a few moments, your drive will format.  strong5)  Remount the drive (optional)/strong  precode#diskutil mount /dev/disk4 /code/pre  It will probably show up as code"NO NAME"/code on your Desktop.  You can rename it here or to do it at the time of formatting use code-v Type in a Volume Name/code when you format the drive.  <answer269472> Why so hard to explain things, it is the main reason why many new users get away from linux.  Just do  mkfs.vfat -F16 /dev/sdb(x) if you want to name the USb, flash, etc... put this in addiction -n (name), then it looks like this:  mkfs.vfat -F16 /dev/sdb(x) -n (name) and hit enter.  <comment275642> This results in a FAT32 formatted drive. <comment275645> You can also try `newfs_msdos -F 16 /dev/xxxxxx` where xxxxxx is your drive that you want to format.  Let me know if that works and I will update the answer. <comment275647> Thanks, this worked (first it gave me 'resource busy', had to unmount first). <comment275649> I'll update the answer for you.... <comment275673> In OS X 10.8.5 I didn't have to use `sudo` to have `newfs_msdos` format my disk.  Are you saying in 10.11 it's required?  Anyway, nice directions. +1 <comment275674> @user3439894 I had to use it in 10.10 as well as 10.11.  I don't know if or what changed in the OS.  Thanks for the compliments. <comment275713> How large is the SD Card? FAT16 has a nominal size limit of 2GB. `diskutil` should still be able to do FAT16 up to 2GB, I use it a lot. <comment338481> OS X/macOS **is not** Linux and OS X/macOS doesn't have `mkfs.vfat` _command_.
