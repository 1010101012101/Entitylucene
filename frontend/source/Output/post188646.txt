How to disable restore/resume/saved-state for a specific application in Yosemite <body> For most applications I like the OSX feature of remembering which documents were open.  But it drives me nuts in Preview.    In past versions of OSX there was a simple preference that could be altered for each application: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/177469/18486  This no longer works in Yosemite.  Is there an alternative?  <answer188648> After some playing around I found a workaround, not sure if there's something better:  ol liOpen Preview, close all documents, close Preview./li licodecd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.apple.Preview.savedState/code/li licodechmod -w ./code/li licodechmod -w */code/li /ol  There will be similar folders for other applications.  <answer270324> As for the "similar folders" mentioned by Dalin, there are a bunch in ~/Library/Containers; but there may be another in ~/Library itself.  precodecd ~/Library rm -rf 'Saved Application State'/*   # eliminate contents chmod 500 'Saved Application State'  # make it read-only /code/pre  This blocks automatic saving for other applications in this location. You can find the other 'Saved Application State' folders as follows:  precodecd ~/Library/Containers find . -name 'Saved *' /code/pre
