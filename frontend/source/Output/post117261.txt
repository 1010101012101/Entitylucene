How do we create a short cut for an application and pass parameters? <body> I am trying to find out, how can I create a short cut of an application and add a parameter to the application short cut so that when it executes, it executes with that parameter. In Windows, I can right click and create a short and then go to properties and in the target area, I can add the additional parameter it has to use to run. Is it possible to do it in Mac?  <answer117263> The apps aren't really designed on OSX like Windows apps.   The easiest way is to create a command file :   codeopen ./AppName.app --args yourArgs/code  <comment137029> Of course it's possible, although it might help to know the application and argument/parameter too. <comment137033> I am trying to launch Stablecoin-qt app with -server parameter.
