iOS Mail app only shows specific message when searching for it <body> I'm currently using iOS 10.02. I have a live.de Mail account.  My problem is that the iOS Mail app sometimes does not show some specific emails. At the moment I have the following situation:  ul liWhen checking mails via web access or PC, my inbox currently contains two messages, one arrived on Oct 17, and the other one yesterday, i.e., Oct 20. /li liThe iOS Mail app only shows the message from Oct 17, but does not show the other one./li liWhat's very strange is that if I search for the message from Oct 20, iOS Mail finds it. I can open it, but buttons for moving, deleting and marking the email are greyed out./li /ul  Does anyone know why the iOS Mail app won't show that specific email?
