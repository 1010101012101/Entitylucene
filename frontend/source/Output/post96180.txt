Macbook pro mid 2009 in a extended acer g276hl monitor <body> I have a G276hl acer monitor which I use as my second screen with my MBP. Previously I used it with no problem at its maximum resolution (1920x1080).  Yesterday I format my computer and when I connected my monitor using VGA (the same way as before) the screen resolution doesn't cover all the screen and at the left a white line is shown, it looks like this:   http://postimg.org/image/45gp5uv69/  I'm using the latest version of OS X (10.8.4).  Any of you know how to solve this problem?  Thanks in advance!
