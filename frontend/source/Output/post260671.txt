Display Device-Compatible Apps in iOS App Store <body> When I first plugged in a peripheral device, the App Store opened up and showed me apps which were compatible with this device. I downloaded one or two. However, I would like to see this same list, again. strongIs there a way to show all of the apps in the App Store compatible with a particular device?/strong It seems this feature is only available the first time you plug in the peripheral.
