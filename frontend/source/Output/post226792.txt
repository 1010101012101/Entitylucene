How do I get Terminal to stop forgetting history in 10.11 <body> The current version of Terminal seems to have restructured history into a session based history management. For example, each tab has its own history on exits of Terminal and starting up Terminal again would put back everything the way it was.   While I find this a nice idea it seems to have issues with constantly forgetting history when you have to exit (e.g. reboot) which seems to defeat the whole purpose of history.  As I recall it used to be that Terminal would remember the last closed history... but, it doesn't even seem to do that anymore.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  Oh, and my .bash_history is owned by me. (another similar post has this as an answer) but, Terminal doesn't seem to be using that anymore.
