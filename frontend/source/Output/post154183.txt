Do not disturb Setting for emails <body> i have an iphone 5s with ios 8.1 and would like to silent my phone at night and only to sound when i receive and email sent to my specific email address. Is this possible?  <answer154186> You can set 'Do Not Disturb' mode for specific times, &amp; allow phone calls from chosen people, or from anyone who calls twice in quick succession, but I know of no way to do that for email.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3PBWV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
