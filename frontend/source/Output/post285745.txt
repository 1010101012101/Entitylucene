Can photos in messages be shared to Apple mail <body> I often receive photos in Messages that I would like to forward to others via eamil. Currently I am using a copy/paste method but frequently I get multiple copies of the photo pasted.   strongAny suggestions on how I can message photos by sharing/exporting directly to Apple Mail from the Messages app?/strong  <answer285746> Yes, there is an easier way to do this. Since it's not clear whether you're on a Mac or iPhone/iPad, I'll provide steps for doing this on both.  strongFrom a Mac:/strong  ol liWithin your message (i.e. in the Messages app) double-click on the photo/li liThe photo will open in a separate window/li liClick on the emShare/em icon at top right of the window/li liSelect the Mail option from the menu/li liThis will now open a brand new email window with the photo already attached/li /ol  strongFrom an iPhone/iPad/strong  ol liWithin your message (i.e. in the Messages app) tap on the photo/li liThe photo will enlarge/li liClick on the emShare/em icon at bottom left of screen/li liSelect the Mail option from the menu/li liThis will now open a brand new email window with the photo already attached/li /ol  <comment360461> Sorry, was unclear that I would like  to share from iPhone Message. I can do as you suggested on the iMac Message, but not from the iOS version. <comment360463> Ah, ok, I've updated my answer and edited your question. Let me know if you still have any questions.
