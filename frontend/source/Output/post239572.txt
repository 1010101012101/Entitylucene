Prevent display from sleeping <body> I'm trying to use an auxiliary LCD as a light-pad/bed/table by loading up a 1080p white .PNG in preview and setting fullscreen ON.  The problem is after several (20?) minutes of inactivity I get the Apple screensaver kicking in, and then have to enter my password.  How to prevent this?  Nothing in System Prefs - Energy Saver works.  http://osxdaily.com/2011/03/21/temporarily-prevent-a-mac-from-sleeping/ suggests codepmset noidle/code but that's also fails.  <answer239573> Try System Prefs  Desktop &amp; Screen Saver  Hot Corners.  I have mine set like this... just shove the cursor to the top left of the main screen &amp; no more nodding off...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ndeC4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer239580> In addition to the "sleep corner" mentioned in Tetsujin's answer, there is also a small app out there called Caffeine which you can use to prevent the machine (and thus display as well) from sleeping. Note that it will even stop a laptop from sleeping when the lid is shut, so be sure to disable it. There are also alternatives like Amphetamine and Owly that seem to do the same thing, but I've only use Caffeine. All of them hit the same underlying OSX setting, apparently.  <answer239590> I'm using an app called Caffeine. It's free and can be downloaded from the Mac App Store.

Simply navigate to this preference pane, then in the bottom left corner, select the Start after: menu and choose Never.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p3Phe.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D7ms2.png" alt="enter image description here"   <comment294034> Does System Preferences - Desktop and Screensaver - Screensaver not work? <comment294045> @JMY1000, thanks, this is the answer! And my bad for being really blind. <comment294129> bib already included Caffeine an hour before you posted and there's no need to post the same information in another answer in the same thread unless you can expound upon the answer already given.
