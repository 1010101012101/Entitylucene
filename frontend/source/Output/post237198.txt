Where is it?br I entered all of the things needed but it won't work.  <answer237204> You Solution can be found in this SuperUser Question  If you want to use smb without a password, you have some options to bypass the "blank password issue", but it basically won't work. The Samba Service in Windows 7 simply does not allow you to do so.  I your specific case, the Username would be your Win7 Account Name and the password would be blank. But since Win7 (smb) does not allow a blank password for authentication you can not log in.
