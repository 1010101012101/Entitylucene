How to connect HP F1903 monitor to MacBook Pro? <body> I connected my HP Pavilion F1903 monitor to my MacBook Pro using the Rocketfish adapter I purchased from the Apple salesman at Best Buy.  The monitor is turned on, but what's showing up on my laptop screen is not appearing on the monitor.  How do I get my laptop to talk to my external monitor?  PS:  My monitor is probably 7 years old, and my MacBookPro is less than 2 years old.  <comment85800> Which os, and which adapter i.e. DVI to HDMI? <comment85949> Do you get _any_ image - background color changes - anything?
