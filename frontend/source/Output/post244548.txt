can't add my present account to folder > Get Info > Sharing & Permissions on Macbook Pro <body> I want to access MacBook Pro OS 10.11.15 files from a Windows 7.  Can read files ok but writing causes permission problem. ERROR AT WINDOWS IS:  "You need permission to perform this action. You require permission from the computer's administrator to make changes to this file."  At MacBook, I cannot enable Read &amp; Write for my MacBook account.  I select my hard disk. Open Get Info  Sharing &amp; Permissions. But + button is grayed out.  So then I tried going to the folder I'm working with; open Get Info  Sharing &amp; Perm..; my present account is not listed; the + is enabled so I click it; the list shows my present account, but disabled (grayed out)  THINGS I'VE TRIED SO FAR, THAT DIDN'T WORK: opening Windows File Explorer with "run as administrator." At Mac  Terminal window:  set permission of root to read &amp; write (chmod a+rw *) Set permission of target folder to read &amp; write: cd to folder chmod -Rf a+rw * Turned off Mac and Windows Filewalls.  <answer244566> Solution: Mac  Sys Prefs  Sharing  File Sharing  Shared Folders: select  Users  Everyone:  changed from 'read' to 'Read &amp; Write' fixes it.  BUT, the best solution is this: Leave 'Everyone' as 'Read only' or remove 'Everyone'.  Press [+] box and add Mac account that is same name as my current Windows account, and set it to read &amp; write. What magic!
