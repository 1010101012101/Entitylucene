Why do I get an invalid certificate error with my Gmail account in iChat/Messages? <body> I've had this problem for a long time now, and it's finally bothered me enough to ask. Can anyone explain why I get an invalid certificate error when I try to sign into my @gmail.com account within iChat (now Messages)? Or how to fix it so this doesn't happen any more? I have another non-Gmail Gtalk account that logs in without any error at all.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lqSFH.png" alt="invalid cert" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E9tbz.png" alt="insecure login"
