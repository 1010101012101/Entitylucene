Is there an app that allows me to use Google Scholar on an iOS device? <body> I'm looking for a native app that allows me to use Google Scholar on my iPhone.  Does such an app exist?  <answer128345> There is no direct(native) application from Google for Google Scholar like Google Authenticator or Google Translator. But, there are some ios apps that supports Google Scholar search.  The best one, I can suggest you is Papers which supports Google Scholar.  You can also go with apps like Easy Search($0.99) and ArticleSearch(Free).
