How to create a 'New Email with Attachment' option in Finder? <body> With OS X Lion, the 'New Email with Attachment' option is missing from Finder. It is supposed to be replaced with the new "Share Button". Unfortunately, the only two ways I can share a file are Airdrop and iMessage. I use Mac Mail and this isn't present.  I checked 'Services' under 'System Preferences' and didn't see any option to add email to the share menu.  How do I customize the share to items?  <answer62159> Is the service present and emenabled/em in the Services section of Keyboard Preferences?  You should see this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x3UCg.png" alt="Services preferences"  If it's not there for some reason, you can recreate it easily in Automator.   Create a new Service in Automator, add the "New Mail Message" action to the workflow, and change the first drop down at the top so it reads "Service receives selected strongfiles and folders/strong in any application". It should look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O6OZE.png" alt="automator workflow"  Then save it, and you should have it available in your services menu.  <answer131122> To create attachments, you can drag files from Finder into an empty email message. But I agree that this is too much work.  To save some keystrokes, you can create attachments by dragging files from strongFinder/strong directly to the strongMail/strong icon in the dock - doesn't matter if strongMail/strong is running or not.  NB. In most cases dragging files to an app icon in the dock will do something meaningful, depending on the file type and the app.  <comment71699> Thats weird... Does your email account appear under "Mail, Contacts & Calendars" in System Preferences?
