Unable to find the backed up photos in iCloud <body> I had an iPad mini which had some valuable photos in the Photos app. I had backed up the device on iCloud using 4.2 GB of my available 5 GB of space. Now that device is dead and is beyond repair. I thought I had the backup in iCloud and didn't take care to backup anywhere else. Now when I open iCloud, I see that it is completely blank. Is there any policy Apple has to delete the backup after a certain amount of time? Is there any hope for recovering these photos?  <answer246279> You can restore your backup to another iOS device to recover your photos, if they were included in your original iCloud backup.  You can find detailed instructions on this Apple Support page: Restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch from a backup  <answer246640> From iCloud: iCloud storage and backup overview:      Here’s what iCloud backs up:        […]        ul   liPhotos and videos on your iOS devices        ul   liHowever, if you turn on iCloud Photo Library on your iOS device (iOS 8.1 or later) or Mac (OS X v10.10.3 or later), your photos and videos are already stored in iCloud, so they aren’t included in your iCloud backup./li   /ul/li   /ul   This means that if you have strongboth/strong iCloud Backups and iCloud Photo Library turned strongon/strong, your photos are "backed up" to iCloud but they are not duplicated in the device backup (to save your iCloud storage).

Photos do not appear on iCloud.com unless iCloud Photo Library was turned on; from your description, it seems that it is not turned on: that is why the Photos section of iCloud is completely blank. You evidently did not have iCloud Photo Library turned on, so photos were tied to emyour device backup/em instead of being tied to your iCloud Drive. Thus, your photos are not visible from your iCloud account. But have no fear, that doesn't mean you can't access your photos.  hr  h2How to get your photos back/h2  You'll need a new/used iPad that runs iOS 7 or later (so iPad 2 or later, iPad Mini 1 or later). You can buy a relatively inexpensive used iPad Mini 1st gen here for ~$150, or upgrade to an iPad Mini 4th gen (the latest and greatest) here for ~$350. Make sure the iPad you purchase has at least as much storage space as your lost iPad before you buy it. (strongNote/strong: Apple may offer to exchange your dead iPad if you contact their support team at getsupport.apple.com)  When first launching the iPad (if it's used, you must do a factory reset first if it still has data on it), follow these steps to set it up from a backup of your lost iPad Mini:  ol liTurn on the new iPad./li liFrom the Apps &amp; Data screen, tap codeRestore from iCloud Backup/code, then sign-in to your iCloud account./li liProceed to “Choose backup,” then choose from a list of available backups in iCloud (probably just choose the latest backup)./li /ol  After following these steps, your new iPad will boot up and have all of the data from your lost iPad Mini, emincluding all of your photos/em.  hr  h2What to do to prevent this next time/h2  I recommend using the Google Photos app to seamlessly back up all of your photos/videos (free of charge, unlimited photos and videos). With Google Photos, you can access the backed-up photos/videos anytime on almost any device (including from the web at photos.google.com). Or, you can turn on Apple's iCloud Photo Library, in Settings - iCloud - Photos, which lets you access the photos anytime from icloud.com. (Note that iCloud Photo Library eats up your iCloud storage space and isn't free or unlimited like Google Photos is.)  hr  Let me know if you need any further assistance, and please let me know whether this helped you or not!
