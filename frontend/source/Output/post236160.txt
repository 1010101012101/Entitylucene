Error message from calendar program <body> When I log into my computer I get this message from my calendar program:  precodeThe server responded with an error. The request for account "iCloud "failed. The server responded with "412" to operation CalDAVCalendarSplitDualTypeCalendarQueueableOPeration. /code/pre  What does this mean and how do I fix it?  <comment288956> Can you give more details such as what model your Mac is (iMac, MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro or Mac Mini), the official "Apple Subfamily" designation (e.g. Retina, 13 inch, Late 2014) or its model identifier (e.g. MacBook Air 6,2), and your software version (e.g. OS X El Capitan v10.11.4). Also, what calendar program are you using? <comment288980> @brick Don't think that the model of the Mac is important here. What would help to dig deeper is OSX version, application used and where the message is coming from (doesn't look like an error popup, is this from a log file). Also, does the error occur regularly? And if there are several calendars configured for the account: Does it also occur if one (or all of them) are disabled?
