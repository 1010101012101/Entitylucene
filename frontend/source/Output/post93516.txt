Copying 85000 files...(takes literally for ever) <body> So I have these 85000 files (totally 2.5gb) that I wish to copy from my Mac to my ReadyNAS NV+ [X-RAID] with RAIDiator 4.1.10 [1.00a043]  It's a bunch of Matlab files.  Anyway, it's like it cannot be done. I went thru the wired network and let it copy all thru the night. From 9pm to 8am and it still said "30 hours to go..." Before that I managed to copy 30gb of data (30 files) in an hour.  Are there any better ways of copying these files that I don't know about? I'm using the finder.  <answer93517> If your NAS supports FTP or SFTP, you could try with a client like Cyberduck. That could be more efficient than through the Finder (with AFP).  <comment109716> Didn't think about that :) Makes sense as I also can resume downloads/uploads if interrupted. I will try! <comment109718> Do you use a Virus scanner ? <comment109720> What weird network? For normal human been wifi network with standard speed of 100-200 kbps you get 1 gig per hour, so it should take 2.5 hours! <comment109724> no virus scanners. <comment109725> Also, it's only slow when copying huge amounts of tiny files. One huge file 10 times as big is a lot quicker to copy <comment111994> FTP did the trick! <comment111995> also, another thing that worked was to SSH to my NAS and tar bzip the folders
