Is there a way to show the calendar on iPhone lock screen? <body> I used to be a Windows Phone user and I loved the way the calendar (a today's agenda) is shown on the lock screen. So I was wondering if there's a way to see a days's events on the iPhone lock screen. It happens that I feel I am out of sync with day's events without having it on my lock screen.  <answer167066> Swipe down the screen from the top, it will show events you have set to show at the lock-screen.  You can decide what to show in Settings  Notificationsbr &amp; whether to allow it at all in Settings  TouchID &amp; Passcode  <answer167091> Not without jailbreaking, the notification centre is currently the only place where widgets can be displayed in iOS.  <answer181557> You can do a screen capture of your calendar and then use the image as your lock screen   <answer181560> Lock Screen Calendar is supposed to do the trick  <answer206532> "Lock Info" on the app store can do this. Works pretty well but not as good as some of the jailbroken alternatives.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lock-info-lock-screen-reminders/id683108563?mt=8  <answer285151> You can simply swipe left from the Home screen to see all Calendar, Reminders, Travel, News, Weather, and much more!  <comment195873> As a wallpaper or background? No - otherwise see tetsujins answer <comment195878> I dont want it to swipe down I just want them to be shown without pulling down.. <comment212250> @uDaY Not possible (without jailbreaking) <comment215924> not very practical, showing a outdated calendar. <comment215925> Well, you could make a new one every day... <comment215932> This actually is really helpful for many people. There's even software to automate this on OS X. <comment263095> I can't find any decent jailbrocken alternative. Would you mind sharing a name?
