zsh: no matches found <body> It seems I have some zsh misconfiguration. I use youtube-dl regular to download videos. But since a few days, I get this error  precodeyoutube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkd6JkfI4yk zsh: no matches found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkd6JkfI4yk /code/pre  I did not change anything with my zsh configuration. Why do I get this error message and how can I make it work again?  FYI I don’t have oh-my-zsh installed.  <answer254020> You need to escape the code?/code and code=/code using backslashes:  precodeyoutube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=mkd6JkfI4yk /code/pre  <comment316219> Thanks, this works, but why is this happening now? In bash it works fine. <comment316330> @Sebastian I don't know — with my oh-my-zsh configuration, when I paste in the link it auto-escapes it for me.
