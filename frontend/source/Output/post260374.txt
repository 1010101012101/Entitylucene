Mount FAT32 partition (external drive) on Mac <body> I have an external disk drive of 2TB with two partitions, one NTFS and another with FAT32 format.  The NTFS partition is automatically mounted when i plug the device using Paragon NTFS but I  don't know how to mount the FAT32 partition.   Can someone help me with this? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GkZH4.png" alt="This is what diskutil list shows on terminal"  More info: Here is what windows shows on Disk Management when i plug the external disk img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uejgn.png" alt="Windows screenshot"  <answer260375> Try "diskutil mount /dev/disk1s2" in terminal (without quotes) and it should mount that drive for you.   <answer260380> precodemkdir /fat_mount # create area to mount FAT partition mount -t msdos /dev/diskXXX /fat_mount /code/pre  ^ Thats how to mount fat drives/partitions in Mac OS, also useful for single user mode recovery. Note I think some versions may ship with "mount_msdos" as opposed to using "mount -t msdos" but I haven't used enough to say for sure.  <comment325973> That is the NTFS disk, not the fat32 one <comment325974> Can you connect the drive without using Paragon, and run diskutil list again and post the results? <comment325980> It shows the same... i have uploaded a screenshot from windows to show that the fat32 partition is there. <comment325981> That `/fat_mount` directory will be created on root directory? <comment325982> Also.. what's `/dev/diskXXX` will be? according to `diskutil list` results i mean <comment325983> What do you get when you issue the command `gpt show -l /dev/disk1` <comment325984> I get: `gpt show: /dev/disk1: Suspicious MBR at sector 0` `gpt show: error: bogus map` `gpt show: unable to open device '/dev/disk1': Undefined error: 0` <comment325985> /fat_mount is an empty directory on root, its just where your disk will be mounted (and accesed) , acording do your output it would be /dev/disks1s3 (I guess if you wanted to mount the FAT parition of XBOXGAMES. (or try /dev/disks1s2) Although your diskutil screendump and GUI screen dump show conflicting information. <comment325986> i got the result `mount_msdos: /dev/disk1s3: No such file or directory` <comment325993> I have a feeling (meaning I can't test my theory at present) that your Paragon software is causing the issue.  Do you have another Mac you can try to mount this drive on?  Or, as a solution, can you copy all the data (in Windows) to two separate folders, reformat as MBR/FAT32 and then copy everything back? <comment325995> When you have the NTFS partition mounted, does it report the same size as what you see in windows, or does it report a 2TB size? <comment325996> It reports 2TB size <comment341340> according to your screenshots your should be using /dev/disk1s4
