Apple TV (1st Gen) doesn't update <body> I've got an ancient AppleTV that was briefly (3 months) used when it was new.br It doesn't have the USB connector so it must be 1st generation I'm guessing.br After those 3 months I moved to another house and the AppleTV got lost.    I found it again last week and I have been trying to get it updated to the latest IOS version for this device (it is still on V5.0.1), without any luck so far.    I can connect it on my Wifi (both 2.4 GHz and 5Ghz) and it does login to iTunes using my AppleID. I can see/play the U2 album that everyone got as a freebie and some other stuff I bought last year for my iPhone.br (I had to disable 2-factor authentication first on my AppleID because the AppleTV couldn't deal with it.)  The AppleTV tells me there is a software update for it, but when I tell it to go ahead it just remains stuck in the phase "estimating size of download".br If I wait long enough (seems to be about 1 hour) the update attempt just aborts without any error-message and I'm returned to the settings menu.br I have attempted this several times. Rebooted the AppleTV also and tried again after a fresh boot. Same effect.br I also attempted to do the factory-restore as this will also force-update the software. In that case it goes to "Downloading latest update" but again, that seems to be all it is doing. Progress bar remains stuck at 0.  I can obviously make the attempt using a wired connection in stead of Wifi. I haven't tried that yet because I need a longer UTP cable which I need to buy first and the shops over here are closed on Sunday.br EDIT: Tried it with wired connection... No joy either. Same effect.  Does anyone have any suggestions what I can try next ?br Or it this a futile endeavor because of the things age and should I consider it a write-off ?
