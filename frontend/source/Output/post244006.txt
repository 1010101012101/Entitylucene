Endless spinner when trying to update Xcode in App Store <body> I'm trying to update Xcode on my Mac mini.  When I click the strongUpdate/strong button in the App Store, a spinner appears, but nothing else happens.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AjKPr.png" alt="Eternal spinner screenshot"  I have seen this before, and I think that possibly upgrading of the App Store fixed it.  There's no App Store update this time.    I am trying an OS upgrade to EL Capitan.  Is there anything else I should check?  <answer244106> Here's what I had to do  ul listrongUpgrade OS X/strong to the latest  ul liThis stopped the eternal spinner - instead the spinner showed for a second, then nothing happened/li liIn the past, updating the App Store itself helped/li /ul/li liGo to the strongUpdates tab/strong and click strongUPDATE ALL/strong  ul liApp Store asked me for my credentials then ran all upgrades, including Xcode/li /ul/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RXZ3T.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment300591> You can't upgrade to the latest version of XCode without El Capitan. <comment369730> I had to throw away it eventually, and reinstall
