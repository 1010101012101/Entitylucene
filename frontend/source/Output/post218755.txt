How do I change the selection in BBEdit's Currently Open Document pane with the keyboard? <body> When I open more than one document in BBEdit, a Currently Open Documents pane is shown. I can change the selection in the pane (and change the document shown in the editor pane) with the mouse pointer. Can I change the selection in the pane with a keyboard shortcut?  <answer218768> Check in the menubar - View - Previous Document/Next Document. The shortcut for emPrevious Document/em seems to be kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbd[/kbd and for emNext Document/em kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbd]/kbd on an US-keyboard.  On my (german) keyboard I use kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbd5/kbd and kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbd6/kbd though.  <comment264510> You're right. It is alt-cmd-[ and alt-cmd-] on my US keyboard. (I changed them to shift-cmd-[ and shift-cmd-] for consistency with apps that use tabs.)
