iPhone 4 and strange mobile data issue <body> I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 7, I have an active data bundle and the provider says everything is set up correctly (APN etc.).  However, mobile data only works if I activate tethering and then use a different device, and bizarrely it works in WhatsApp. No other apps (Facebook, Maps, SpeedTest) seem to be able to access mobile data.  Any ideas?  <comment189777> Have you tried to restore your network setting under Settings  general  restore setting (at the bottom)? <comment189826> in addition to @Jules excellent suggestion, I find that many people haven't simply tried powering off and on <comment189855> @Tyson Simple powering on and off the device normally won't solve the problem. A hard reset could solve it. A hard reset is executed by holding the power button and home button together until the screen goes black. After that simply turn on the iPhone by pressing the power button for some seconds. <comment190035> I'll try these, thanks
