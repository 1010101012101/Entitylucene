Do I need Parallels Pro to run Visual Studio? <body> I'm considering installing Parallels to use Visual Studio for my personal use. Can I use the standard $80 version of Parallels? Or do I really need to commit to $100 a year for the Pro version?  <answer272701> In general, the pro version offers support for larger memory and more cpu cores. The said VS plugin offers cross-platform debugging and testing, as well as many other automation and command-line support for it.  This doesn't, however restrict that you're able to install VS on the virtual machine.  Therefore it would be possible for your use case.
