Im trying to run a webserver in iMac but it doesn't work in port 800 <body> Im trying to run a local web server Mongoose on mac, its default settings is listening on port 8080,I want to change it to 800 but it doesn't run mongoose once I changed it to 800. What seems to be the problem?  <answer112105> The difference is that 800 &lt; 1024, but 8080 â‰¥ 1024.  Ports with numbers less than 1024 are emprivileged ports/em (google that) on Unix like systems, which means that only processes which run as root are allowed to listen to them.  <answer112106> You have to run as coderoot/code to bind to the privileged ports (&lt;1024). You can run Mongoose via codesudo/code, but then you will have a web server running as coderoot/code. Not a good idea!  Changing user with coderun_as_user/code parameter also seems to be unsupported on Mac:  precodeMongoose[22361:507] The application with bundle ID (null) is running setugid(),     which is not allowed. /code/pre  Why don't you pick a port above 1024 e.g. 8081? Then you can run as unprivileged user.  For troubleshooting you can run Mongoose in Terminal.app like this:  precodesudo /Applications/Mongoose.app/Contents/MacOS/Mongoose /code/pre  <comment131680> @Carsten sorry, you reply came in while I was typing my reply in... <comment131682> Im trying to force it in 800 because I'm doing a mac version of an existing windows app. It also acts as a local web server running on port 800. It also uses Mongoose. Well I think I'll have to look for a workaround for this. <comment131704> Happens to me all the time, also you give additional information on the specific web server, of which I have never heard.
