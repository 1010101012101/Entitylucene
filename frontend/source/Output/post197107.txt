How to attach video from Photos app to Gmail message <body> I'm using the new Photos app on OS X Yosemite. I've imported multiple photos and videos from my iPhone 5 and they are now in my Photos library.  I would like to attach one of the videos in my Photos app to a Gmail message. I've tried dragging the video from Photos to my Desktop, but I get the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBHt2.png" alt="Export Error"  I've also tried searching for the filename in Finder (IMG_2671.MOV), but that yields no results. Does anyone know how to get this working?  <answer222013> The Apple Photos app keeps all photos, thumbnails, application settings and other image/video meta-data in it's own package file located at strong~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/strong. As such, you won't find the original images or videos in a normal Spotlight search.  Native OSX applications can present themselves to Photos as a compatible extension. You can see these when right-clicking on a photo or video and selecting emshare/em.  h2Exporting the video from Photos/h2  As gmail is not a native application with this capability (and a quick google search suggested no alternatives), you'll need to export the video and attach it manually.  Select the video in Photos and choose File - Export  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uruAm.png" alt="Export Menu"  You can choose to export the video unmodified. However, as you'll be attaching the video to an email, you may want to choose strongExport 1 Video/strong and select a smaller strongMovie Quality/strong so the video will fit within gmail's attachment size limit of 25mb.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NKskX.png" alt="Export Options"  <answer256615> The (ludicrously roundabout and infuriating) solution that worked for me came from a macrumors thread:     drag the picture(s) from Photos to your desktop and then upload with Gmail from there.   Trying to attach directly from Photos using my browser crashed Chrome multiple times. What a massive series of failures (or willful withholding of functionality?) by Apple: no file dialog, no Share to copy to clipboard, no Gmail option. The Photos team should be ashamed no matter how this came to be.  <comment235616> The original file is inside the Photo Library, which is a package, you'll have to perform the search inside of it. I don't know why exporting the video gives an error. <comment235617> You could also try selecting the video and exporting with cmd+e or via the file menu, which gives you more options. <comment268937> [Reference](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6584?hl=en) for gmails attachment size limits.
