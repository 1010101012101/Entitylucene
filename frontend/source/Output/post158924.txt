How can I write an Apple Script in order to check if bluetooth and ethernet are on or off? <body> I'm trying to write a little script in order to check whether or not bluetooth is on and whether or not an ethernet cable is plugged in. I searched the System Preference dictionary built in the app but it seems there isn't any help about checking if the bluetooth is on or off.  Can anyone help me? Best Regards Simone Piersigilli   <answer158939> This can by done by involving some command-line foo:  precodeset btStatus to do shell script "/usr/local/bin/blueutil power" set enStatus to do shell script "ifconfig en0 | grep 'status' | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d ' '"  if btStatus = "1" then     set bluetoothEnabled to true     log "Bluetooth is enabled" else if btStatus = "0" then     set bluetoothEnabled to false     log "Bluetooth is disabled" else     log "Could not determine Bluetooth status" end if  if enStatus = "active" then     set ethernetEnabled to true     log "Ethernet is enabled" else if enStatus = "inactive" then     set ethernetEnabled to false     log "Ethernet is disabled" else     log "Could not determine Ethernet status" end if /code/pre  The interesting parts are the first two lines.  Please note:  ul liThis requires blueutil to be installed (you can install it easily using Homebrew)/li liYou might need to change codeen0/code to the interface you want to check (you can get a list of all interfaces by entering codeifconfig/code into a terminal)/li liYou might need to change the path to codeblueutil/code (depending how you installed it)/li /ul  <comment186808> What do you have so far? <comment187368> To be honest, anything
