Changing the default iTunes download directory <body> Is it possible to change the download directory of iTunes on mac?  ul liI use mac OSX (10.8.5) and iTunes 11.0.5./li liI want to relocate the directory on a external hard disk storage?/li /ul  <answer102382> The default folder would be  precode~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Downloads /code/pre  You can change the location of your codeiTunes Media/code folder in codeiTunes &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced/code. But this would mean that you also relocate your Music, Podcasts, Movies and Mobile Apps to the external drive.  <answer147404> You can move the Downloads folder in your code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Downloads/code directory to your external drive, and then create a symlink (symbolic link) to the new Downloads location, and place that symlink in the  code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Downloads/code directory.  Here it is in step form:  ol liQuit iTunes./li liGo to code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/code, and move Downloads to your external drive. Ensure you move the folder, and you don't just make a copy./li liOpen Terminal (located in code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/code)/li liEnter codeln -s "/Volumes/NAME_OF_YOUR_EXTERNAL_DRIVE/Downloads" ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/Downloads/code/li /ol  Substitute the codeNAME_OF_YOUR_EXTERNAL_DRIVE/code part with the name of your external drive that you placed Downloads on. Downloads needs to be in the root directory for that command to complete successfully.  <comment168004> [iTunes for Mac: Moving your iTunes Media folder](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1449).
