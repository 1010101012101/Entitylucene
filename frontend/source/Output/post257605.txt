iphone 5S connected to computer not showing any of the pictures from my phone <body> I have tried two different computers now.  I "trust" the computers and I can see my device but it only shows 26 of the 300 pictures.  I have plenty of free space on my phone for more photos.  I have not downloaded them all to my computer.  Trying to do that now.  Latest software update (10) was completed recently.  Help!
