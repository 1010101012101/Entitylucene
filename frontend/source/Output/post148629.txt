Recognize audio vs video podcasts in iOS <body> When searching for podcasts in the official iOS app, is there a way to see which ones are audio vs video? Or filter the search?  <comment175041> File size will tell, Audio is usually not more than 5 Meg. <comment175042> That may be true for an episode, but what about an entire podcast? To quickly see from the search result which ones are audio... <comment175044> MP3, WAV, ALAC, <comment175045> what? Where do you see that??
