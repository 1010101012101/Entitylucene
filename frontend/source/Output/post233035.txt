mac search for file type <body> I am trying to find mp3 and mp4 on my external hd.  I tried to follow these methods here.   How Can I Search A Specific Type of File in Mac?  This did not work  precodekind: mp3 kind: mp4 /code/pre  This was the only method that would seem to work.   precodefind / -iname '*mp4' 2&gt;/dev/null  find / -iname '*mp3' 2&gt;/dev/null  /code/pre  I am using el capitan. After I click the other button the File Extension option does not seem to exist anymore.   precodeStart a search with Command+F. Click on the '+' icon on the far side of the taskbar Select the type from the 'kind' pull-down menu. Select 'other' and then find 'File extension' /code/pre  I don't see show all or file extension anywhere.   precodeOpen a Find Window (cmd-f) or do a spotlight search and select "show all" Hit the little "+" icon (to the right of the 'save' button) Select File Type as a search criteria and select the correct one. Rerun the search. /code/pre  This didn't seem to do anything.   precode.mp3 .mp4 /code/pre  <comment284858> So, uh... There's a method that works in your question: what exactly are you looking for? <comment284946> @perhapsmaybeharry I would prefer a gui method because I can never remember that command.
