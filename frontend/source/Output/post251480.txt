Cannot Turn on Location Services <body> When I open System Preferences, go to Privacy, unlock the pane with my password. When I click on the 'Turn on Location Services' checkbox, the computer freezes, and the box turn blue and immediately turns white. How do I fix this?  <answer251487> What you are describing sounds similar, but not identical, to the problems discussed in this Reddit thread. No solution to the problem was presented there besides one suggestion of a possible script to enable it.  To give you a better answer, though, it would be helpful to know more about your setup. What type of Mac do you have (how much RAM too), does the WiFi work like normal, which version of OS X are you running, how long have you experienced the issue, did anything lead up to it, and are there any other details that might be unusual and relevant.  You might be able to get more professional assistance by sending a direct message to Apple Support's Twitter account. There may be specific diagnostics to try.  Some other ideas to try would be to repair disk permissions (depending on which version of OS X you're on) or verify disk in Disk Utility. Or log in to a guest or other new user account to see if it is specific to your account or not. Or you can try resetting the P-RAM. Or in the end of the day you may just need to make a backup, reinstall OS X, and restore.  <answer254139> strongTry clearing temporary/cache files/strong  These files are automatically generated and don't contain any of your data.
