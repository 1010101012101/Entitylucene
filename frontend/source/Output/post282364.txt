Symantec endpoint protection cannot delete infected file <body> My Symantec Endpoint Protection says everything is up to date (I ran LiveUpdate). I did a full scan and it identified three trojans. The help pages say that I can click 'Repair' or 'Delete'. I tried clicking 'Repair', but under 'status' it says 'not repaired'. I tried clicking 'Delete' and it says 'Delete Files Error: some files could not be deleted'. What now?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cupuD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment355649> Before "repairing" or "deleting" the soft link (the file highlighted is only a soft link to the real file ./Versions/A/RimInstall) upload it to virustotal and check if it's really a trojan. Please add the sha256 checksum of the file /Lib/App Support/Black../Blac..app/C.../Fr/R/V/A/RimInstall.
