Black bar at the bottom of my screen on new MacBook 2016 <body> I have a black bar at the bottom of my screen which changes as I use the Touch Bar, but cannot remove it. It is eating up my screen space and I cannot see the Dock.  Does anyone know how to remove it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/08zsA.jpg" alt="Black Bar at bottom of screen"  <answer269598> Finaly after seeing this questionI understand what it is you are seeing.br It appears to be the touchbar zoom functionality.br You can find this and deactivate it by strongrightclicking the system preferences item/strong.br Then select strongaccessibility/strongstrongzoom/strong and strongdeselect touchbar zoom/strong.brbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwG5k.png" alt="touchbar zoom"brbr strongBe sure to use the rightclick method to go to accessibility, otherwise the touchbar zoom option wont show up./strong
