Open application in specific space through AppleScript <body> I have a script that I run when I get to work to open all of the applications that I work with. But when I run it they all open in one space. I'm running OSX Yosemite 10.10.3.   So I need an AppleScript that will make new spaces if needed and then open the applications in specified spaces.  <answer191966> If you lock an app to a space it will always open in that space, no script required. the limitation is that all windows of each app will be in the same space; no way round that except manually, afaik.  First open the app in the required Space, then right click the Dock icon &amp; select 'This Desktop'br After that, if you check from any other Space you will see the Space number listed.  em[&amp; I do wish they'd stop calling them Desktops]/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eAgGQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you really need it to be scripted, then this MacScripter page has all the calls - http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=23453
