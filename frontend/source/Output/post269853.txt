Turn off the macbook main display while working with monitor <body> MBP 2015 13, 10.12.2  I want to use an external display via HDMI and turn off my Macbook Pro's display. How can I do it?  strongemUpdate/em/strong  There is another question: How do I turn off laptop display when I have an external display?, but I don't think this one should be marked as duplicate.   Its 2017 now and the old question has answers from 2011-2014.  The other thing is - that the old question has also links to other answers and solutions. With this question we have answer with 2 variations of how to do it in one place.  <answer269865> h2Using an external keyboard and mouse/trackpad/h2  You can use codeClosed Clamshell Mode/code. This is a feature built in to Macbooks that allows you to use them like desktop computers, with the lid closed and using a monitor as your only screen.  You'll need:  ul liAn AC power adapter (like this one)/li liAn external keyboard and mouse or trackpad, either USB or wireless (like this keyboard and this trackpad)/li liAn external display or projector (like this one)/li li(Optional) A dock for your MBP (like this one)/li /ul  To put your MBP into Closed Clamshell Mode:   ul liConnect your keyboard and mouse/trackpad to the computer /li liPlug the computer into power/li liConnect it via HDMI or Thunderbolt to the external monitor/li liClose the lid /li /ul  Once in Closed Clamshell Mode, the Macbook's screen will turn off and it will still be outputting picture to the monitor.

Your screen will be off but the keyboard and trackpad built into the Macbook will still be on and available. Optionally, you can download the free app Amphetamine to keep your Mac from sleeping.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L6OK2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment339052> Are you using the internal keyboard and mouse at the same time with the external display or an external keyboard and mouse with the external display? If the latter, just close the lid on the MacBook as an external display, keyboard and mouse will work with the MacBook in clamshell mode. <comment339065> @user3439894 I would use the internal keyboard and mouse if it possible <comment339070> @MikroDel Can't you just turn down the brightness all the way then? <comment339074> @owlswipe please update your answer with this information. It will have than both variation - I will accept it. thanks :) <comment339075> @MikroDel Done. <comment339148> The update needs to be edited - remove the "this isn't a dupe - that's for [meta] discussion" just make exactly clear how the current situation is materially different from the linked question (keep the link though). If the only difference is old - we strongly prefer to close as dupe and get the correct answer in the old thread.
