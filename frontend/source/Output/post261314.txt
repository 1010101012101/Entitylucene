network to OSX from ubuntu 16.04 <body> When I try to connect to my OSX Sierra machine from ubuntu using: smb://xxx.xxx.xx.xx/  I get a prompt for username and password that I fill out and confirmed the credentials are correct from my OSX machine.  But I cannot connect, I dont get any warnings just a quick refresh of that prompt and nothing.  From OSX i have tried this codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server SigningRequired false/code  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7589427?start=0&amp;tstart=0  I have confirmed file sharing is on and users have read &amp; write privilege.  What am I overlooking?  here are log outputs from syslog  precodeNov 16 18:24:14 myUser org.gtk.vfs.Daemon[1806]: Kinit for macUser to access (null) failed: Cannot determine realm for host Nov 16 18:24:14 myUser org.gtk.vfs.Daemon[1806]: NTLMSSP packet check failed due to short signature (0 bytes)!

You really shouldn't be using it if this is a home  setup - not because it's insecure, it's just overkill.  What caught my attention was that your log showed Kerberos errors.  Did you install it unintentionally?  Also, do you have file sharing enabled on your Mac? <comment327820> @Allan I never installed it myself.  yes I have file sharing on in osx.
