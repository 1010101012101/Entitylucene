Alternative to Finder? <body> Is there some alternative to Finder.br Something like Q Dir  I am basically looking for something that could have more than one tab opened at the same time in one window. So that when I am doing frog-and-drip that I need to have only one app (window) open.  <comment260331> Possible duplicate of [Are there any free alternatives to finder?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4944/are-there-any-free-alternatives-to-finder) <comment260332> Alternatively, if you can stand the command line, use Terminal: `open`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, and `ls pretty much` are all you need. <comment260342> Finder has tabs. Just saying.
