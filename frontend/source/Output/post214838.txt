Apps for screen rotation hotkey? <body> So I'm using the latest El Capitan, and I find myself using my strong'external'/strong monitor both portrait and landscape mode simultaneously. It's been quite bugging to go into system prefs. and changing the screen orientation every time I rotate my screen.  Is there a way to simply rotate the orientation without having the hassle to go through all those steps?  <answer214848> http://www.magesw.com/displayrotation/  This program is added on to menubar, and basically allows user to change to rotation accordingly.  This also allows you to press cmd + ctrl + opt + 0 to return to landscape
