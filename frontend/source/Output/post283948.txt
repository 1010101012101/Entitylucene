Enhanced Siri voice for VoiceOver has to re-download <body> I use VoiceOver sometimes, and the voice I have is the Siri enhanced female voice i. From time to time though I notice the voice reverts to a more robotic regular voice, and the enhanced voice has to be re-downloaded. This is despite the fact that Siri itself still has the more human-sounding voice working.  What might cause this?
