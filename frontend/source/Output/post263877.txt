Activating an unlocked iPhone 7 Plus, Verizon model <body> I have bought an international iPhone 7 Plus from a Texas Apple Store. On a receipt it says:     Verizon Account Information No Wireless Service Activation during   iPhone Sale   Will I be able to activate the phone in another country (that is supported by the iPhone's GSM bands), without a US simcard? Do I even need to put in a simcard to unlock it these times, or just WiFi?   I read Apple's FAQ but it was not clear.
