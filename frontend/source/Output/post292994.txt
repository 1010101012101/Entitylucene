Deleted Photos Library continues to appear in Time Machine backup <body> I have an external USB drive I have been using as my Time Machine volume for several years. I back up both my main internal SSD and another separate external HDD (which I'll call "ExternalVol") to this Time Machine volume (which I'll call "TMVol"). I trigger backups manually when I have both ExternalVol and TMVol attached. TMVol contains only about 30 backups. I ran the two most recent backups last night and a few moments ago.  If I look at a complete directory listing of the most recent backup of ExternalVol on TMVol, it exactly matches a directory listing of the original ExternalVol, with one exception: the backup on TMVol contains a Photos.app database directory (called codePhotos Library.photoslibrary//code) which is not present on the original ExternalVol.  I had moved my Photos library to ExternalVol at one time in the past, but that was over a year ago and the Photos library has long since been moved back to my main SSD. It is in its standard location in the Pictures folder under my home directory, and also shows up in that location on the backup of my main SSD on TMVol.  Why does a directory that was deleted from ExternalVol continue to appear in every new Time Machine backup version? Does this have any other implications for the accuracy of my backups, and should I be concerned?
