Create intelligently parsed reminders from applescript or automator <body> I have found that I can programmaticly create reminders in Reminders.app from applescript or using automator on the command line, but I'd like to be able to do so while taking advantage of the intelligent due date parsing of the Reminder App.  So currently when I run my command line automator workflow or apple script, I could create an event and name it "Do some work at 9pm" and I'll be left with a Reminder called "Do some work at 9pm" in my app, however, I'd like it to work like it does in the app where I'd be left with a Reminder called "Do some work" with a due date of tonight at 9pm.  Is there a way I can take advantage of the intelligent task parsing in the app, but from applescript or automator?
