MacBook Pro LED Display wont turn off <body> I replaced the LCD Display Driver Board because of shadows at the bottom of my screen. Unfortunately, this did not improve anything. When I put the machine back together and booted up, the display now will not turn off - at all! I have to take the battery out for it to go off.   It boots up and runs just fine. It goes to sleep, the screen goes black and in about 2 seconds the screen becomes solid white. if I tap the space bar, it blinks back to black, and the password prompt comes up (as it should). The computer shuts down properly, and I went to terminal to verify this and all said success.   WHen it shuts down, the screen blinks up to white again and stays that way unless I take out the battery. Of course it is also unplugged. I have posted elsewhere and not received a response. I called the supplier where I bought the replacement Display Board and a tek said he had never heard of this problem before, and that it sounded like anyway I needed a new LCD Panel since the board did not solve the shadows on my screen.  oh, and both the SMC and PRAM reset procedures have been done - to no avail, alas.   Help please!!
