Ipod 4th gen - Spoofed messages appearing from a contact <body> My kids each have an ipod 4th gen.  Both have recently received what looks like a message from me that I didn't send, asking them to follow links or install apps.  I need a way to resolve this and prevent it from happening again - any ideas?
