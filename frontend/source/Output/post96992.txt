Copy and Paste files into the same directory using Terminal <body> I am currently trying to figure out how to Copy and Paste files (more than one file) into the same directory using Terminal.  I am trying to create a script to create the same file. If there is a better way to do this, please let me know.  What I need to do with this script is to be able to create certain file types with specific sizes. Example: a image file (let's say a PNG file) that is 10MB in size and I need 4 of them. When running a command to create this file in Terminal it looks like:  emmkfile 10m image.png/em  I created a script to repeat the command but it fails as it creates the same file and overwrites it.  Thank you,  K  <answer96997> So, does it matter if the file is the same file?  ie: Let say there is a picture google.png  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gunqy.png" alt="Google logo"  and you want it to copied into the same dir 4 times.  as an in that directory you would have google.png google 2.png google 3.png google 4.png?  If thats what you want:  precodefor i in {1..4}   do      cp google.png "google$i.png"   done /code/pre  But if you want the "images" files to be different, and they are going to be gibrish files, but 10m in size exactly  you wanna do something like   precodefor i in {1..5}    do       dd if=/dev/random of="yourfilename$i.test" bs=12428800 count=1    done /code/pre  This will make four files that are 10m in size filled with bunch of random characters.  Comment and let me know what you really want and I can go back and redo this.  It would help if you posted your script that fails so I can see what youre trying to do.  strongEDIT:/strong  Changed the in device from /dev/zero to /dev/random to generate random file content.  <comment113821> Please add your script to the question. Also: if you want to create four files, how should they be named?
