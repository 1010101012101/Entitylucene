iPhone 6s stuck in recovery mode loop <body> I've seen many posts about this issue, but none have fixed my issue yet and wondered if anyone else has fixed it?  After trying to restore my phone from a backup, the phone has entered a loop round the Recovery Mode and now I cannot even restore my iPhone as a new phone.  I am trying this with:  ul liiPhone 6s/li liWindows 10 Laptops/li liLatest iTunes/li /ul  I have tried:  ol liClicking 'Restore' iPhone/li liClicking 'Update' iPhone/li liDifferent USB cables/li liDifferent USB Ports/li liDifferent laptop (both Win10)/li liShift-Click restore and providing my own IPSW file/li liDFU Mode with multiple laptops/li /ol  Each time, just getting this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rJJPs.png" alt="Screenshot".  I'm going to try using my Mac when I'm home and I have a reservation at Apple but it's for Friday...Anyone have any suggestions?  <comment363594> Did you have beta iOS11 on it before? <comment363602> @Tetsujin Sorry, forgot to mention. Yes, it did, not sure why this would stop it from restoring a new restore? <comment363603> It's apparently become 'expected' if not 'intended' behaviour. afaik, there's no fix at present. There is another recent QA but I'm on my phone so hard to search right now. <comment363606> Previously having iOS 11 beta is crucial and is the cause of the problem, see the linked duplicate and also [iPhone 6s stuck in DFU mode after downgrading](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/287886/37797) <comment363609> Reinstalling iOS 11 is a good shout. I'll try find an IPSW of it and report back. <comment363619> Perfect, downloaded the IPSW from the developer portal of the Apple website and managed to at least set up my iPhone as new...now to try to restore the data. Thanks for the help. @grgarside <comment363627> That sounds like useful info to add as an answer to the dupe
