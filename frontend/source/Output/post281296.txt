How do I recover my keychain passwords? <body> I just changed my password from the Users and Groups menu in System Preferences from a different account and forgot to change the keychain as well. Now I reset the keychain and everything works again but I lost all of my saved safari passwords and probably more! How can I fix this? Do I need to rename the renamed keychain file back to codelogin.keychain/code? Any help is appreciated.
