Time Machine is decrypting my old backup? <body> Last week I reinstalled my Macbook because of problems with Filevault. I did a fresh install, new library and all. Now I see that I missed one document folder, and I want to restore it from backup. I attached my Time Machine disk, created by the old installation, and was asked if I wanted to use this as backup disk, which I want, so I agreed.   First I got the message that I wanted to make an encrypted backup on a disk that was not encrypted, now I see that TM is decrypting the backup.   What is going on here?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gjcZI.png" alt="Time Machine settings"
