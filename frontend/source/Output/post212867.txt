Connecting Wiimote to Dolphin Emulator <body> I having tremendous amount of trouble connecting my Wiimote with the dolphin emulator on Mac. I am using the latest version of dolphin. I have both the Wiimote and the Wiimote plus. The Mac bluetooth easily detects both Wiimotes and connects with no issues. While Dolphin detects the Wiimote to some extent (it shows up in the controllers dropdown in settings), it does not connect. The lights on the Wiimote stay flashing, it never actually connects completely. Any ideas why this is? Is anyone else having such issues?  I appreciate any suggestions.  <answer212887> Does this help? http://youtu.be/YgZP6vtU5PY  I admit I have not tried it, but who knows, it might work.
