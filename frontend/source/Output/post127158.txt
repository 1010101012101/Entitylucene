iOS 7 settings usage shows no data for Videos app even though there are 1 GB <body> I've noticed that when going into iPhone Settings → General → Usage, Videos app has no data written instead of showing the 1 GB of videos I've uploaded through iTunes. Why is that? The remaining space is shown correctly though.  <comment149026> I'm guessing that since Music, Videos, and Photos & Camera all show No Data on my iPhone, that data is tracked somewhere else. <comment149035> Yes and no. Photos & Camera shows 756mb used on my iPhone and it's correct. Music has no files at all so that'd be correct too. Can't say the same for Videos.
