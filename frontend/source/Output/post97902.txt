Restoring apple iPad <body> I got an iPad from a friend. It wasn't new, but they reset it so I could start again. The only thing is, I need to get into  the restrictions stuff to change the restriction settings. Problem; I don't have the restrictions pass code. There is no way I can contact the friend since they moved and blah blah blah, I don't have or want a backup, and I can't use iTunes. I am wanting to restore like factory settings, so I can make my own passcode. Any help?   <answer97906> Try entering DFU mode and restore it from there.  To enter DFU mode:  Step 1. Connect iDevice with your computer.  Step 2. Start iTunes.  Step 3. Press power- and home-button of your iPhone and hold it down  Step 4. Maybe the “Turn-off” slider will appear – continue holding down both buttons!  Step 5. The iPad will turn off.  Step 6. When the display turns black for four seconds, release the power-button. Don’t release the home-button!  Step 7. iTunes will show you after 5 to 10 seconds that your iPad has entered the DFU mode.  Step 8. Restore Your phone  Hope this helps  <answer98206> A complete restore of the iPad should turn Restrictions off, so I don't see why they are on, unless the "reset" that your friend did wasn't a restore.  If you can use Settings  General  Reset  Erase All Content and Settings, this should completely restore the iPad back to factory settings and remove the Restrictions.  <comment114958> I can't use iTunes. <comment115004> I think you should try using redsn0w's restore function.
