How can I type the "@" symbol via remote desktop with a Swedish keyboard? <body> I am running Remote Desktop to connect from my iMac with Snow Leopard to a Windows box at work that runs Windows 7 Professional. The connection is done over ssh.  When logged in to the window box I can use Alt + Tab to switch between programs, I can also see that when using emacs pressing Alt registers as Meta (which is what I have set it up as). However if I want to type a @ which on my Swedish keyboard is Alt + 2 nothing happens. The same is true for { and [ and so on.  <answer32666> Does  kbd⌘/kbd + kbdalt/kbd + kbd2/kbd work? This is a combination for @ in bootcamp.  For the other keys:   ul likbd⌘/kbd + kbdalt/kbd + kbd7/kbd  to get {/li likbd⌘/kbd + kbdalt/kbd + kbd0/kbd  to get }/li likbd⌘/kbd + kbdalt/kbd + kbd8/kbd  to get [/li likbd⌘/kbd + kbdalt/kbd + kbd9/kbd  to get ]/li /ul  <answer32669> You could use the character palette.  System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard tab Check "Show Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar" (If necessary, press Input Sources... and enable Keyboard &amp; Character Viewer)  Then open the Character Viewer from the menu bar, locate the character you need, and double-click it to insert it.  <answer32695> Perhaps you could set up another keystroke to produce @ via system preferences/language &amp; text/text/symbol and text substitution.  <answer59267> kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbd2/kbd did the trick for me (on Swiss German keyboard).  <answer81375> I use Cord and Danish keyboard and I get the ampersand (&amp;) using  Right-kbdalt/kbd + right-kbdcmd/kbd + kbd2/kbd.  <answer168934> On my keyboard alt-G also did not work, however, alt-E works for the EURO sign. After some trying I found the strongalt-Q/strong is the solution for the at (@) sign on the remote desktop (which is a Windows system).  <answer175801> Shift + ± worked for me when I typed all the characters on the keyboard using Shift key  <answer175807> Perhaps not an answer, but on a UK keyboard @ and " swap places from Mac to Windows  kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd  kbd 2  /kbd is @ on Mac, " on Winbr kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd ' /kbd is " on Mac, @ on Win  <answer196784> kbdalt/kbd + 0 worked for me. (under mac its produce ø, under vm win7 its produce @)  <answer224501> alt gr (the alt symbol on the right hand side) plus semicolon worked for me  <comment37352> No unfortunately it does not work. I can do ctrl + alt + 2 to get "@" but since ctrl + alt collides with other keyboard mappings I would much rather have it work with just alt + 2. <comment37357> Did you try AltGr+2? <comment37360> I think alt + ctrl maps to AltGr since there is no AltGr on the Mac keyboard. However, pressing ctrl + alt interferes with other commands in some programs, like using alt as meta in emacs. <comment37361> That is one solution it's just that it is very very slow. <comment209716> This also works on a Norwegian keyboard <comment235144> Please don't add "thank you" as an answer.

It's just because none of previous answer worked for me so i add the way i solve my use case.  Maybe that will help someone.  Don't understand your comment. <comment272271> And what keyboard does your answer apply to, Swedish? <comment272300> Mac keyboards don't have an alt/gr key
