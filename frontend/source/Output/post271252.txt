Disconnect/connect USB device from command line <body> Assume I have a Galaxy phone connected via USB to my mac  Listing USB devices is easy, and I can see my phone connected:  precodeioreg -p IOUSB -l -w 0 /code/pre  Is it possible, given I have the ioreg output, to disconnect a specific device (without PHYSICALLY disconnecting it)?  <answer271282> If you want to unmount it and have it's UDI (Unix Disk Identifier, i.e. codedisk1s3/code for the 3rd partition on your second drive) you can run codediskutil unmount diskXsX/code from the terminal, and remount it by using the same command, replacing unmount with mount.  If you are using codeAndroid Debug Bridge/code to connect it you can open a terminal, go to whatever folder its installed to, and run code./adb stop/code to shut down the local Android USB server, then code./adb start/code to reconnect when you need to.  You could also use Disk Utility to unmount the device.  Finally, if you want to eject it to simulate unplugging it completely without physically unplugging it run codediskutil eject diskXsX/code from the command line, or right-click the phone in Disk Utility and click the "Eject" button.  EDIT: If you are not using ADB or a similar program like Android File Transfer (AFT) then you will not be able to disconnect the device, because it never connected in the first place. In order for an android device to connect to a Unix system (and by extension macOS) you need to fulfill two conditions: 1.) The device must have developer mode enabled, and USB debugging turned on, or your device will auto-deny any requests from another computer to connect through USB. 2.) You must have a program like ADB or AFT installed, these programs run a local Android MTP server and are required to send the connection request to and read the filesystem of the Android device.  Developer mode can be enabled by going to codeSettings&gt;About Device&gt;/code and tapping on codeBuild Number/code 7 times, USB Debugging is in the developer options menu that it now at the bottom of your settings page.  The official AFT app for macOS can be found here: [link] (https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) and the command line version of ADB can be found here: [link] (https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html#download)  Once both prerequisites have been met you should be able to disconnect the device without unplugging it by stopping the ADB server or by unmounting/ejecting it as one would with any other external filesystem.   <comment340999> To clarify, by "disconnect", do you mean you want to unmount it from the file system, or make it invisible to your computer? Also, if the former, would you like to be able to reconnect it without needing to unplug it and plug it back in? <comment341087> I can't see the phone in diskutil nor can I use adb (for that matter)... <comment341544> I have updated the answer with info that takes your situation in to account, if ADB will not work in general AFT can be used instead. Why, may I ask, is it that you cannot use ADB? <comment341576> +1, Thanks for the effort you made in answering my question :) I can't use ADB as I need a solution not only for Android devices, but also for blackberry, iOS, etc etc :) <comment342038> Well, as far as Blackberry OS goes I believe it has been based on the Android Open Source Project for quite some time, so the solution should be the same for those two. With an iDevice it should natively mount like a USB drive and be ejectable via Disk Utility/diskutil if it runs an iOS compatible with your iTunes version. You might have to programmatically check whether the device is Android/BB or iOS/generic USB and use one of the two methods accordingly, as I don't know of a way to universally unmount like that. You might be able to use the unmount command as root if it's a loop device. <comment370598> This is not a correct answer. The OP asked for method to `Disconnect/connect USB device from command line`, your answer is to `Umount/mount in diskutil`. They are not the same. I can for example, right click a disk to eject it, and then it will be removed from diskutil and cannot be remount again. Nor do we know what command has the same effect to the right click eject. <comment370599> @timothymh regardless what he is asking, I like to know how to remove a device from diskutil and add it back. Unmount command doesn't remove a device. Right click the device icon and select eject is different, it CAN remove a device from the diskutil, and the only way to add it back is to physically replug it. <comment372239> @aeroxy `diskutil` *is* a command line program. It is the command line back-end for Apple's *Disk Utility.app*. The equivalent command is `diskutil eject diskXsX`, where X is the disk and partition. After that command is run you will have to unplug/reconnect the USB device to remount it again. There is no way to eject and then reconnect the device without physically reconnecting it, as the computer treats an ejection as though you have physically unplugged the device. <comment372279> That's not true. We had macs set up in our office and we can use a custom GUI tool to do it remotely. <comment372874> @aeroxy You say it is a custom GUI program, and you provide no explanation as to how it functions internally. Using the `diskutil` command does permanently eject the device, so we can assume it does not use the `eject` verb with `diskutil`. So, can you please confirm how it manages to treat the device as physically disconnected, and then manages to reconnect it? I see you telling me my answer is wrong, yet I don't see an alternative answer or explanation from you. So if its true that I am wrong, please post the correct answer, rather than simply claiming mine is wrong. <comment372875> @AlisonE.E. I don't know how it works, someone else made it and I couldn't figure it out myself, that's why I am here looking for an answer. Such custom GUI program's existence has proven the possibility of to ejecting and then reconnecting a USB device without physically reconnecting it, which subsequently, proves you wrong.
