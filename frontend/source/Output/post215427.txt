Wireless with 802.11r, 802.11k and 802.1x <body> I was recommended to seek for assistance here from the Networking/Stack Exchange site towards OS X queries, do hope someone has the answers.  Have El Capitan on a testing iMac and deploying 802.11r/k with FT-dot1x from a Cisco WLC showed no issues with wireless connectivity. Though one client showed up with a MacBook with wireless issues. Turns out the OS X version on the Mac is 10.7 "Lion"...that is apparently old and obviously doesn't support 802.11r/k. Found a good page within Mac support for iOS (Wi-Fi network roaming with 802.11k, 802.11r, and 802.11v on iOS) but not a support matrix for OS X.  Is there any available support matrix/table/information for listing which versions of OS X hardware and operating system versions towards 802.11r/k support?  <answer216749> I found the answer for anyone who is interested.  According to this thread, no support for 802.11r/k for Os X up to 10.9:  https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/12314591/8021r-and-fast-roaming  <comment260976> This thread is looking a bit sad... can anyone mention what is the oldest version of OS X they've had working with 802.11r? <comment261495> I'm fairly certain there's not going to be a way to support those standards without upgrading the Mac OS X version. <comment261754> That could be the case though it would be good to find out which version of Os X starts supporting these 2008 standards. We found out Lion didn't and El Capitan did. <comment362352> According to that, OS X 10.9 doesn't support 802.11r mixed-mode, but 10.9.2 does. But I don't see anything about it in the update notes for either [10.9.1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202891) or [10.9.2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204448). I'd like to see specific confirmation...
