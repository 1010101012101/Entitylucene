Trackpad malfunction after last macOS update (Sierra 10.12.3) <body> I am looking for information / help from someone who might experienced similar issue in the past or has knowledge about the problem described below.  During last week I have been experiencing issues with strongtrackpad on MacBook Pro Retina 13' Mid 2014/strong.  It all have started the strongnext day after latest macOS Sierra 10.12.3 update/strong.  strongSymptoms/strong:   ul linot registering multitouch commands, like thumb + 3 or 4 fingers, swipes/li lifreezes on the movement just to pick up a second later /li listops to respond at all/li limoves and send click signals by itself without touching/li /ul  Some/all of this happen when I try to use trackpad. When left alone, with external usb mouse plugged in, I can use the software mouse without any issue (using external mouse).  I have tried to fix it with:  ol liRestart/li liNVRAM reset/li liSMC reset/li limacOS reinstallation/li /ol  strongsadly, none of above helped./strong  strongValuable Info/strong: Apple Diagnostics tool shows that I have problem with memory (PPM002 error code and potential PPM003 and PPM004). Apple code reference page says nothing more about them but to contact nearest Apple Authorized Service Provider.  I will appreciate any form of help.  emAnd yes... My warranty expired just two weeks ago./em  <comment342448> Turning off trackpad input in Accessibility preferences helped with cursor self-moving and now I can use Mac with external mouse though the problem is still present. <comment361200> Yes, me too!  Still having it as of Sierra 10.12.5.  I also had it on two different machines, a Macbook Pro and a Macbook Air, so I seriously doubt it's anything hardware related. <comment361353> Thanks for sharing. I still haven't resolved the problem. I think I will visit Apple's Service next week and see what they have to say about it. <comment361392> [See my answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/271558/choppy-mouse-on-macos-sierra-10-12-3-both-trackpad-and-wired/286445#286445) â€” a permanent "cure" via repeating Recovery Reinstall.
