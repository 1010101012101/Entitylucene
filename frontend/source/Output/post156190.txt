Is there a way to force the system to immediately reflect a replaced icns resource of an app? <body> I have programmatically replaced an app's icon with the icon from another app (see code below). Now I want the change to propagate (visually) right away™ … But the former app still keeps showing the old icon in Finder, Dock and Application Switcher.  strongQ/strong: Is there a way to force the system to emimmediately/em reflect this icon change? Preferably by means of entering some code in my shell.  Here's an example script showing what I did:  precode# copy-terminal-app-icon-to-iterm.sh # ---------------------------------- # First backup original iTerm icon mv /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/Resources/iTerm.icns /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/Resources/iTerm-original.icns     # Then make iTerm use the same icon as Terminal.app cp /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/Terminal.icns /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/Resources/iTerm.icns /code/pre  Can I add something in this script to make it "kick in" right away?  I tried codekillall Finder/code but that didn't affect anything. And this answer didn't work for me either. (Besides, that question is targeted towards updating Dock whereas mine is Finder-/system-wide).  <answer156208> Choose Get Info on both apps.    Click on the little iTerm icon in the upper left, select CMD-C.  Click on the little Terminal icon in the upper left, select CMD-V.  It should immediately replace the application icon.  This feature has been available since at least 10.5.  <comment183718> Patrick: thanks for replying. However I feel that I didn't ask the question the right way. It's more of a programmatic question. I've updated it to hopefully make more sense now.
