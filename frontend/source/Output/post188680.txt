finding large videos in the OSX Photos app <body> Is there a way to find all videos above a certain size using the new Photos app so that they can be selected for Export or put in an album?  I'd like to move large videos off to an external drive, but I can't find a way to select them (or indeed, to find them at all).  <comment223409> what is wrong with Finder all files sorted by type <comment223410> @Buscarì›ƒSD I only have 41 movies in Finder and 320 in Photos.app, apparently Finder does not show files from Photos.app <comment223413> use "All my Files" and it should show them. <comment223989> Looking at All My Files, I am baffled about how to make it show videos or, indeed, any large files at all.  It bears no resemblance to what I know is on the disk.
