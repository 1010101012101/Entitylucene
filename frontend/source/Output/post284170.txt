Problem with the ring/silent switch on my IPhone 6? <body> I have a problem with my IPhone6 especially the ring/silent switch .It doesn't work. I can't keep my Iphone6 without sounds. I sent it to repair and they told me that now it should work. I tried but it doesn't work yet.  What should I do to control the sound?  For example when I chat with someone I can't switch off the sound of the messagges. I don't want to buy another Iphone6.
