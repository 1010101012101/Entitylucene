Keyboard Shortcut to Right Size All Columns Individually in Finder in OSX Lion? <body> Is it possible to set a keyboard shortcut for resizing all columns individually in Finder in OSX Lion?  The way to do it without a shortcut is right clicking a column divider and choosing the second option (Right Size All Columns Individually). The problem is the option gets reset when I open a new window.  <comment340129> Have you found a way around this eventually?
