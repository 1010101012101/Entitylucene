Sharing internet connection from ethernet to wifi NOT using apple sharing <body> I want to share my internet connection on 2 pcs (imac+mac mini), however, the default internet connection sharing stuff, is really unstable. Is there any 3rd part alternative, working stable?  Thanks.  <answer35066> i've personally never seen any 3rd party apps.  If you really want a stable connection i'd recommend buying a cheap router. I don't think the wifi module in mac's are good enough to share a connection reliably.  <comment39954> i already have a (great) wifi router, but for reasons i find it hard to explain (nothing that could be fixed hardware/software) i can't use it. So in your opinion the point is the cheap hardware in the mac itself. Well, that's interesting, thanks. <comment39955> Just an opinion, but i've had the same issues as you before with sharing over wireless. <comment48025> I think you are asking for how to achieve your chosen solution, rather than describing your problem and seeing what people come up with - that may be fixing your unstable connection, or supplying an alternative.  I'm just pointing this out as you are a new user so you may not be familiar with the best way to ask questions on here for maximum answer-potential.  With this in mind, I would suggest editing your question a little to incorporate other possible solutions.  Welcome, by the way :) <comment57944> You should include this key point about your problem with a wireless router within your original question. I guess you are most probably working in  a polluted wireless environment.
