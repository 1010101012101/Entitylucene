Problems After iOS 8 upgrade on iPhone 5s <body> i have iphone5s just bought it a week back and upgraded to iOS 8 and it started restarting at regular intervals and also gets heated up like crazy please suggest   <answer147593> Which version of iOS 8 are you currently running? The lasted update, iOS 8.0.2, fixes some bugs that were introduced in iOS 8.0.1 for some folks. Go to Settings  General  Software Update and make sure you are running the latest iOS version.  <answer147594> Try a hard reset by holding down the kbdHome/kbd and the kbdsleep/kbd together for 15 seconds. The iPhone should then reboot.
