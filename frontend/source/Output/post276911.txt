Is Late 2016 MacBook Pro 13" Capable of 3440 x 1440 @ 100 Hz? <body> I have a Late 2016 MacBook Pro 13" laptop and I am considering buying the Samsung CF791 34" monitor, capable of 3440 x 1440 @ 100 Hz resolution. I realize I may need to buy an adapter, such as the USB-C to DisplayPort Adapter Cable from StarTech, but I'm concerned I won't be able to get 100 Hz from this cable and/or the built-in video card won't support that resolution and refresh rate.  If I buy this monitor and cable, will I be able to use the Mac at 3440 x 1440 @ 100 Hz resolution?  <answer276912> From http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/     Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and:      ul   liOne display with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors/li   liUp to two displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors/li   /ul   <answer282196> The Startech adapter didn't work for me with the Samsung CF791 (the monitor was not getting any signal and I had to return the cable). I did however get 3440x1440 @ 100 Hz using the Anker USB-C to HDMI adapter.

I was hoping one could get more refreshes (Hz) in at a lower resolution, i.e. 3440 x 1440 @ 100 Hz vs. 5120 x 2880 @ 60 Hz. <comment355741> Thanks for the answer. While I ended up returning the CF791 (5 out of 5 CF791 monitors had several dead pixels and text clarity was awful compared to Dell U3415W, which I ended up going with instead), it's good to know Macbook Pro is capable of 100 Hertz refresh rate with the Anker USB-C to HDMI adapter.
