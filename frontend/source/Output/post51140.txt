gptsync showing blank GPT and MBR partition table <body> h3background/h3  I have Lion 10.7 and Windows 7 64 bit (Boot Camp) installed on my Mac Mini.  They both boot fine. But when I tried to run Windows 7 from Parallel using existing Boot Camp, I encountered problem stating codePRL_ERR_DISK_FILE_OPEN_ERROR (0x80021014)/code.  After some googling, I found it is caused by codeGPT/code and codeMBR/code misaligned and can be corrected by using codegptsync/code tool of rEFIt.  I installed rEFIt in my Lion partition and Partition Inspector shows a report with codeGPT/code and codeMBR/code misaligned.  precode    Current GPT partition table:      #      Start LBA      End LBA  Type      1             40       409639  EFI System (FAT)      2         409640    740644007  Mac OS X HFS+      3      740644008    741913543  Mac OS X Boot      4      741914624    976773119  Basic Data      Current MBR partition table:      # A    Start LBA      End LBA  Type      1              1       409639  ee  EFI Protective      2         409640    740644007  af  Mac OS X HFS+      3      740644008    741913543  ab  Mac OS X Boot      4 *    741914624    976771071  07  NTFS/HPFS /code/pre  h3problem/h3  The problem is when I boot Mac mini in rEFIt and run codegptsync/code in shell it only shows        precode    Shell&gt; gptsync     Error: Not Found returned from gptsync.efi     Current GPT partition table:     Current GPT partition table: /code/pre  So...  What was I doing wrong? And how could I sync GPT and MBR table with or without gptsync.  Update  I manage to run gptsync on Mac using enhanced gptsync from here. Now the problem changed to   precodeWriting new MBR... gptsync: Data write failed at position 0: Bad file descriptor /code/pre  <answer51160> I boot Fedora 13 Live CD and use terminal to do the following  precodesu gptsync /dev/sda /code/pre  and my HDD has GPT and MBR synced!!  Now I can use parallel with existing (boot camp installed) Windows in my Mac mini.
