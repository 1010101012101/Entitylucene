How to access Pages document when I forgot the password for it? <body> Sometimes I set up a password for my Pages document, and I forget it. Is there a way to access the document without a password or recover password back anyway?  <answer237592> No. What would be the purpose of a password if you didn't need it to open the document.  Next time, write down the password if you forget easily.  <answer294721> I'm having the same problem. As far as I know there is absolutely no way to open a locked document without the password. I have searched many different websites and the all came up with this same answer.  And I hope for your sake that those documents aren't to important. But don't give up and delete your documents just yet, because maybe if you look in the right places you'll find a way. I recommend that next time you lock a document you add a hint you know will help you.(I didn't do that and that's where my problem started.) I'll come back and let you know if I find a better answer. I hope this helped!  <comment372003> I had a word doc with a password - opened in pages which totally ingored the password !!! So, try making a copy and try every other program to open it - not apple ones but any text type editors : you never know...
