Disk Utility won't erase my USB flash drive ("Couldn't open device") <body> I am willing to dual-boot my MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) macOS Sierra to install Ubuntu.  I am having some trouble with my USB flash drive when I try to erase it using Disk Utility. It says "Couldn't open device". (as shown below)  Please help me ASAP!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4dxH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer274078> The first thing I would try is restarting your MacBook Pro in Safe Mode and trying to erase the USB flash drive then.  To start in Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liAfter booting up, insert your USB Flash Drive/li liLaunch Disk Utility and try erasing the USB Flash Drive/li liTo exit Safe Mode just restart your Mac as normal/li /ol  If this does't work, take a note of any error messages and report back.
