can't create user account after reinstall <body> After erasing my hd and reinstalling Mac OS X Mavericks I am not able to create a user account. It just seems to loop. I also tried to create a second account, for that worked last time, but now it even loops with the second one.  So my question: Any ideas what I could try next? I need my Macbook usable until Wednesday, because I have to write and print my CV and don't own any other computer...  <answer125382> By not logging in with my Apple-ID I have been able to create a new user account.  <comment146722> Lets work on this since you gave us a deadline :), how did you install mavericks? <comment146723> Not sure if you are able to log in or not, Try repairing your permission is the Disk utility app. <comment146724> Start in safe mode by--- Immediately after you hear the startup tone, hold down the Shift key. <comment146725> Did you get the create account screen with the apple id connection stuff?  -- You might want to stay active yourself to solve your issue ASAP as you need it and noted by @Buscarì›ƒ
