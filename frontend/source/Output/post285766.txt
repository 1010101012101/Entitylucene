What can I do to stop Touch Bar overflowing to bottom of screen? <body> My system:  ul liMacBook Pro (15inch 2016) /li liSierra 10.12.5./li /ul  has suddenly started exhibiting some unusual behaviour. The only thing that I've done lately in the settings was in relation to Accessibility and Zoom. I can't see how that has made the Touch Bar overflow into the bottom of the screen as well. Like so: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/159BP.png" alt="touch bar bleeding into bottom of screen real estate"  Does anyone know what I need to do to undo this?  Thanks.  <answer287128> Found the answer here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207258 I think there must be a Mac bug. I had never used Switch Control. It was off. But by switching it on then toggling the Switch Bar on and off via the Switch Control Home Panel  System I managed to finally disable the annoying thing.
