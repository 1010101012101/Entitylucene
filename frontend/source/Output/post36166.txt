Weird characters appear when pressing command-A,C,V <body> I'm not using Mac keyboard however it did work properly before. I changed the kbdCommand/kbd key to kbdCtrl/kbd. Until today, using this kbdCtrl/kbd key yield extremely odd characters. When pressing   ul likbdCtrl/kbd-kbdA/kbd yields å/li likbdCtrl/kbd-kbdV/kbd yields √/li likbdCtrl/kbd-kbdC/kbd yields ç/li /ul  And I have no idea where these characters come from? So how could I fix this issue? Can anyone please help? Thanks.  strongEDIT/strongbr Here is my screenshot  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XnZZ0.jpg" alt="screenshot of keyboard preferences"  <answer36167> It looks like you have accidentally configured your kbdcontrol/kbd key to be your kbdalt/kbd key. Case in point: when I press kbdalt/kbd+kbda/kbd, I get å. kbdalt/kbd+kbdv/kbd returns √, and kbdalt/kbd+kbdc/kbd gives us ç. Go into your settings and check again. They are located in System Preferences - Keyboard - Modifier Keys. Note: kbdalt/kbd is also kbdoption/kbd.  Edit: I cannot duplicate this phenomena (see comments on this answer), so I will guess that the non-Apple keyboard is messing up the process somehow.  <answer167832> If the option key is the one with the Windows logo on it, make sure you have the game switch (the switch with the little joystick on it) set to off.  I think off is left.  With the game switch on, the Windows key is disabled (to prevent accidental Windows key presses from minimizing your game and sending you back to the Windows desktop).  <comment41256> Thanks a lot. However no matter what I change, it will never become the `command key` again since I turn on the Keyboard Viewer and I saw that every time I assign a different key to `command`, it becomes option :(. Really don't know what to do now? Any suggestion? <comment41257> @Chan That is odd. Let me play around with mine and see if I can duplicate what's going on. <comment41258> Many thanks for your help ;). I really appreciate that. <comment41259> @Chan No problem! Couldn't reproduce, so I updated my answer. <comment41261> Thanks anyway. I guess I have to buy a Mac keyboard then. But it's totally weird since I set `command` to `no action` before. The only thing I did before that was reboot the computer from the command line since it was freeze. Other that, I couldn't think of any reason that would cause this problem.
