Apple script switch to nth dock application on key bind <body> Is it possible to press a modifier key with a number and then get that offset number to open and focus the nth application on the dock? If so can you point me towards a resource for doing so?   <comment335735> You can easily switch to any given Space by key-command. If your chosen app is always in that Space, problem solved. if that's an acceptable solution, I can provide details. <comment335739> The problem is there's no visual cue for what offset matches what space unless you've already opened mission control <comment335740> It doesn't take long at all to learn what lives where. I've been using it since Spaces was added, some 10 years ago. I set apps by 'family', general & finder on 1, an online helpdesk I help run on 2, music apps on 3, mail & downloaders on 4, photo editor on 5 with photoshop itself on 6... etc etc Switching to any Space brings forward the last app you used on that Space. I taught the system to my partner, a long-time Win user, a year ago & she swears it's the best move she ever made. <comment335742> I've blurred everything to be illegible & also massively shrunk the image, but this is my Space 1. From left to right, Safari, Finder, Calendar & TextEdit, Messages & Activity Monitor. Nothing overlaps, everything is visible. I have similar for another 6 Spaces. https://i.stack.imgur.com/WVqZu.jpg <comment335752> Desktops and spaces are different things in macos, you are referring to desktops, the problem I'm trying to overcome still applies with desktop switching, which is I want to focus apps by keyboard numerically, seems like ubar gets pretty close but it only switches between apps but not the windows of those apps <comment335753> Apple made the confusion, not me. They were originally called Spaces... now they're called both, sometimes within the same sentence. Look at System Prefs  Mission Control, they're still referred to as Spaces there. imnsho, 'Desktops' was & is a dozy name. Anyway - the only way to call a specific app would be to set an Applescript as a Service in Automator & then key-command that Service. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/265920/85275
