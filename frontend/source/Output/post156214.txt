Mail Envelope Index files in use by other program <body> I routinely copy my Mail data between my two computers I use in different cities, copying any changes in Users ▸ [me] ▸ Library ▸ Mail from one to the other via a portable hard drive.  This method worked great up through Mt Lion but has hit a snag in Yosemite (possibly would have in Mavericks but I skipped that OS.)  Now when I try to copy files I'm informed that all three Envelope Index files are in use. I don't have Mail running and don't run mail until the files are transferred.   I'm guessing something like notification center or other such program is accessing the files but turning off Mail in notification center didn't release the files.   Any ideas of how to "release" these files would be of help.
