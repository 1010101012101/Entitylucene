How does finder figure this directory is 6MB? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNNNm.png" alt=""  The directory says it's 6 MB, but there's about 10 160-byte files.  <answer100086> Because your directory may contain hidden files. OS X uses hidden files (prefixed with a code./code dot when using codels -la/code) to store meta information on the folder (position and sorting of the icons for example). To have a precise breakup of your directory size use  precodedu -h /Users/azz0r/Sites/Personal/php-rest-api /code/pre  in Terminal. You can limit the depth of displayed files with the code-d DEPTH/code option.  To see the hidden files recursively from a directory use the codels -laR/code command.  To show hidden file directly in the finder, you could also follow this post Show hidden files Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and 10.8 Mountain Lion.
