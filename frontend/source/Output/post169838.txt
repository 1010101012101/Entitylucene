How to enter a non-breaking space on iOS? <body> On a Mac, entering a non-breaking space is very easy. On my iPad with iOS 7 installed, I want to enter a non-breaking space. But I find no way.   I have tried the mic on the keyboard. It gives me this :   codeEspace insécable/code :-)  I would prefer a solution coming from the keyboard. I would also like a palette offering characters or snippets.  <answer235163> Find one in a web page (even a page you create yourself, inserting &nbsp;) and then copy it to the clipboard. Paste it in when needed.    <answer235510> In my jailbroken iPhone4 with iOS 7.1.2 I have installed codePersian Keyboard iOS5+/code from the codeBigBoss/code repository in Cydia. For my native language codeFarsi/code, this keyboard has non-breaking space near the Space button.  In the image below I have typed the translation of the codenon-breaking space/code in Farsi codeنیم‌فاصله/code which the correct form is the last line with non-breaking space between ‍codeنیم/code and codeفاصله/code. The middle line has normal space and the first line has no space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dTUIY.png" alt="enter image description here"  If your device is jailbroken maybe there are alternatives for the keyboard in the Cydia repository for your preferred language.  <comment199536> In which application do you want to enter a non-breaking space character? <comment199558> @patrix — Usually, Safari. <comment199560> You should be able to copy paste any character from apps like Unicode Map, and also create a keyboard shortcut to create this character by typing something else. <comment199565> @Tom — I like the idea of a keyboard shortcut. How could I create one? <comment199712> See if this helps:  http://ipad.about.com/od/ipad_basics/ss/Ipad-Keyboard-Settings-Help_3.htm <comment199794> @Tom — Very good idea, thank you ! Well, it's a bit tricky. First, a non-breaking space alone is not accepted as the content of a shortcut. So I chose " ?" Then the shortcut is not proposed in all cases. But I chose the shortcut ",s" and it is proposed in most cases. <comment287625> This is what I do. <comment288642> While I can't jailbreak the device in question, I don't think the answer deserves a downvote! +1.
