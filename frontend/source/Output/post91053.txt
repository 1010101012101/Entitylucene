Upgrading from sudo 1.7.4p6 to 1.8.6p7 on OS X 10.7.5 <body> I downloaded sudo for os x 10.7 from the following link, I followed the readme instructions, but when I call sudo -V I still get the old version number.  I can see the folders related claim to have been changed at the time I ran the suggested command.  Any ideas?  http://archive.hmug.org/BSD/Administration/System/sudo/1.8.6p7/  <answer91066> The command codesudo tar -C / -zxf sudo-1.8.6p7-1-osx7.tar.gz/code should be working, assuming you are in the same working dir as the downloaded file.  You emcould/em add code--overwrite/code to the command, but this may have unintended effects...  I don't quite understand your desire to replace the stock codesudo/code with this seeming random, and unsupported 'update'. If this goes wrong, you may be left without sudo; or you could break more than sudo.  You could uncompress without the code-C //code, and manually move the files into position.  <answer91105> Is code/usr/local/bin/code before code/usr/bin/code on the path?  If not, add codeexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH/code to code~/.bash_profile/code or change the path some other way.  <comment106934> Where does it install - there seems to be no documentation <comment106997> For security purposes at work they want this version of sudo installed on all OS X platforms <comment107199> current PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/X11/bin  I'll try moving /usr/local/bin forward <comment107200> That does make the new version come up, but I need to update sudo for all users <comment107205> You can also change the path in /etc/launchd.conf. If there are other programs in /usr/local/bin/, overriding the default versions might have unexpected side-effects though.
