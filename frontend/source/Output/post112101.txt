What might cause noisy gesture demonstration video clips? <body> I'm getting multicolor noisy gesture demonstration video clips after each reboot. However, they gradually improve after a while and eventually become fully watchable (about 15-20seconds). Does anyone know what's causing this and how to fix it? I'm on Mavericks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/npsQE.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gaj5C.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment131664> How do you mean instruction video clips@? <comment131665> The pane on the right that demonstrates what each gesture means physically. <comment131666> Ahh Ok i'm with you. Does this happen when you play clips in quicktime? <comment131667> Well, no. However, I'm getting similar multicoloured noisy file icons and covers in Cover Flow for many files in Finder. I can preview the videos in Cover Flow though. It's just the icons there in Finder. <comment131668> Well I don't have this issue in Mavericks, so it sounds like it could be either, A) A hardware problem with your graphics card or B) A corrupt install. Are you in a position to do a clean reinstall? <comment131669> I'd prefer not to. :( It's just very strange that the gesture clips gradually improve and eventually become fully watchable. <comment131672> @Kate which Mac are you using? <comment131674> I'm not sure if it has something to do with loading time. In Cover Flow, for some files, if I wait for a few seconds, the icons within range in Cover Flow load up. However, the file icons themselves remain as multicoloured noise. <comment131676> @JohnWoods It's a 2009 21.5" iMac. <comment131677> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11723/discussion-between-john-woods-and-kate) <comment131678> can you check you console for this message : NVDA(OpenGL): Channel exception! <comment131681> @JohnWoods Right. Whereabouts in the console should I look?
