Forcing application to go to selected window on startup <body> I run a multi-monitor set-up on a single "Desktop". All of my applications when opened run on the primary monitor, which is the smaller monitor. I would like to have some (e.g. browser, mail client) open on my secondary, with others (e.g. IRC, terminal, etc) on my primary.  I'm unsure if there's a method to do this natively or if this requires coding, however I'm happy with either solution.  <comment210196> Launch, drag to 2nd screen, relaunch. Not working? <comment210763> Unfortunately not. The machine is a macbook pro, so sometimes I have it plugged into a screen (at work), other times it's just open on its own (at home). Outlook for Mac 2016 always opens in the macbook, whilst other processes seem to flick between them. <comment210804> Ah, as soon as you reduce the machine to one screen, it will pull all windows back inside that screen, so you don't lose them. Intended behaviour. SavedState might send a window to the second screen if it was there last time the app was launched, but not all apps save state - that may be why you're seeing the discrepancy. [MS does its own thing always, even with 2 permanent screens, RDC will open on the 2nd screen, but every connection I ever open opens on screen 1]
