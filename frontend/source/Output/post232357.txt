iMac partition grid screwed. Please help? <body> So yeah i guess i screwed up my iMac 5k retina's (late 2014) partition grid big time and i need your help.  It all started yesterday when i tried to format my computer. I'm selling it tomorrow, that's the reason why i'm stressed out.  At first, i tried formating my bootcamp partition from the disk utility app in recovery mode and afterwards the BOOTCAMP partition was still there so i re-partitioned my disk again with the disk utility app and then the loading got stuck while doing the operation.  My only option was to restart the computer so i did. Going back in recovery mode and in disk utility, i tought the operation was successful because the disk seemed to have got back to it's original state. That's what i tought. I think the next thing i did was to format my microsoft HD and it started going bad from there. Anyway all i want is to get my whole fusion drive to it's original state for the sale !  Here is a picture of the diskutil list and cs list.  Thanks guys for the much needed help and sorry for the bad english and if i don't sound so clear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zH8OV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
