iPhone text messages never get delivered <body> Text messages are disappearing when sent embetween two iPhones/em.  The issue of iMessage losing messages sent to users who have switched to non-apple devices is well documented, but in this case we're seeing one iPhone user message another, and the message never gets through. There's no indication on the sender's side that the message failed- we just happened to notice it on our own. It's happened at least twice within the past few months (though probably a lot more)  Here's the latest example. My friend asks a question, and I respond a couple of minutes later, but she never gets it on her end- though everything looks fine on my side:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHXDg.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOFXV.png" alt="enter image description here"  One possible clue: Her question was sent as an SMS, not an iMessage (which apparently happens when a phone can't access normal data coverage - hence the green bubble.) Did that somehow cause my subsequent reply to get lost?  Whatever the case, there's no technical excuse for a queued messaging system to be silently vanishing messages- Apple's got some explaining to do.  strongUPDATE:/strong  My friend just received the missing message on Feb 7, eleven days after it was sent...  <comment199105> +1 for the screenshots and details. Just curious, do you remember if it said "Delivered" after you sent the lost message? <comment199117> @bassplayer7 - Can't remember if it said "Delivered"- Wish I had noticed, but by the time we realized the message had failed it was several hours later.
