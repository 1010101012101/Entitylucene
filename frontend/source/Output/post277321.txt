AirPlay Audio enabled router/modem? <body> Are there any AirPlay enabled router/modems with 3.5mm jack input (like Airport Express)?  <comment349073> Why not Airport Express? <comment349074> When I stream from Apple Music and watch video (or something similar with high usage of wireless) at the same time, streaming keeps breaking. I assumed, Airport Express is 'not good enough' anymore. Disagree?
