Recover SSH private key passphrase from keychain <body> After performing a macOS upgrade ssh asked for my ssh passphrase. I have completely forgotten the passphrase since keychain has been managing it.  This answer shows how to configure keychain to emreconnect/em and remove my need to enter the passphrase when connecting to a host. After following those steps I can ssh successfully without knowing the private key passphrase, which suggests that the passphrase is stored in keychain.  However, I can't find the ssh passphrase in keychain. Is there a way to recover the ssh key passphrase from keychain?  This question/answer says that keychain keeps passphrases as regular keychain items, but I can only find one item after searching for ssh and that is an older item for my original id_rsa key which is no longer is use.  <answer268175> h3Short answer: There doesn't currently seem to be a way to recover the passphrase./h3  In Mac OS X 10.11 and earlier, SSH key passphrases were stored by codessh/code and codessh-add/code in the user's login keychain, using the following properties (pseudocode adapted from Apple OpenSSH-195.40.1):  precode{     kSecClass: kSecClassGenericPassword,     kSecAttrAccount: pathToPrivateKey,     kSecAttrLabel: "SSH: " + pathToPrivateKey,     kSecAttrService: "SSH" } /code/pre  As of macOS 10.12, the passphrase is queried and stored with properties that force it to be stored in the "syncable" keychain (the database-backed "Local Items", also called "iCloud Keychain" if that is enabled), with access controlled by an "Access Group"; codessh/code will ignore the old items in your login keychain. From Apple OpenSSH 209:  precode{     kSecClass: kSecClassGenericPassword,     kSecAttrAccount: pathToPrivateKey,     kSecAttrLabel: "SSH: " + pathToPrivateKey,     kSecAttrService: "OpenSSH",     kSecAttrNoLegacy: TRUE,     kSecAttrAccessGroup: "com.apple.ssh.passphrases" } /code/pre  Apple has not enabled the codesecurity/code command-line tool to access the contents of the syncable keychain, and for some reason Keychain Access doesn't show the complete contents of it either, even though the ssh keychain item is not explicitly marked as invisible. I also don't think it's likely to be straightforward or maybe even possible to write a program that fetches the passphrase from the keychain, since access is controlled by Apple's code signing.  You can see some limited details about the passphrases stored in your syncable keychain using the codesqlite3/code command, but most of the interesting fields like the item labels are encrypted.  precode$ sqlite3 Library/Keychains/*/keychain-2.db "select rowid, datetime(mdat+978307200, 'unixepoch', 'localtime'), agrp from genp where agrp = 'com.apple.ssh.passphrases' order by mdat asc"   45|2017-01-07 13:53:13|com.apple.ssh.passphrases 46|2017-01-08 23:59:25|com.apple.ssh.passphrases /code/pre  <comment332434> If the passphrase is not in the keychain, there is no way to recover it. <comment332974> @Jakuje, I clarified the question to make it clear that keychain has the password because I can log in without knowing the passphrase. <comment336574> Replaced my comments with a full answer with more details, though unfortunately it doesn't solve your problem. :( <comment336712> Wow great answer. It is curious that I am now in a situation where I relied on my password manager (keychain) to manage my passwords and now have no way to get my password out. Which understandably makes me nervous as a future change to macOS could lock me out of these systems. Going forward I will keep the passphrase in a keychain comment.
