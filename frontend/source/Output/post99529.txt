How to get rid of erroneously drag-n-dropped folder shortcut in Finder toolbar? <body> I erroneously drag-n-dropped a folder shortcut in my codeFinder/code toolbar.  I tried dragging it off and right clicking, to no avail.  How do I remove it?  <answer99530> Hold codeCMD/code (âŒ˜) key down and drag the icon out of the finder window.  It should blow itself away in clouds.  <comment117097> Modding you up since I couldn't read worth a dang. :-)
