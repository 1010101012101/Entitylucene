Assistive Touch on iPad mini is getting turned off automatically <body> Assistive Touch on my iPad mini is getting turned off automatically and when I go to Settings to check the status it will be in the off state.No-one is changing the status from on to off.I don't know why this happening.  <answer179659> At the very bottom of the assistive preferences there's an option to put something on "shortcut" - meaning pressing the home button 3 times.  Any chance you have that on assistive touch and do it by accident?  <comment213065> General advice for any iOS generic weirdness would be -  Restart, then if no joy - [to iTunes] Sync; Backup; Restore. <comment213074> Welcome to Ask Different!
