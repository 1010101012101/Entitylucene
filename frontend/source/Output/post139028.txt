Does Time Machine need the Spotlight index? <body> On OS X, does Time Machine need the index maintained by Spotlight? Will disabling Spotlight completely (via codemdutil/code) affect Time Machine?  <answer139029> Nope.  emMeta note: why 30 the char minimum?/em  <comment164001> You could consider adding information why instead of putting a meta note which makes no sense. <comment164002> I have none, it's a simple experiment, the result can be checked by anybody. <comment164008> Are you talking about disabling Spotlight on your main drive(the one getting backed up) OR on the Time Machine drive (the one with the backup)? <comment164014> @patrix I re-enabled (after completely deleting the index) Spotlight on my main drive and now Time Machine needs a very long time to create a backup. <comment164016> This may also be caused by Spotlight running in parallel to Time Machine. Has the index already been completely been rebuilt before TM started? <comment164019> @patrix Yes, I let the indexer finish its work and only afterwards connected the TM drive. I did not change a lot of files after the last backup - nothing which would justify TM "preparing" the backup for two hours. (I have stopped it then and not finished the current backup yet.)
