Copying hidden files and folders to an external hard disk <body> I use an external hard disk as a backup for my programming projects. Now a lot of files in these projects are hidden files. Like .git or .svn etc. I have been able to view the hidden files but I cannot do a copy paste for the hidden files. Is there something that needs to be activated to allow copying hidden files and folders.  <comment72554> Can you not copy the enclosing folder, or do you need to cherry-pick the (hidden) files to copy? <comment72564> If I copy paste a folder which contains hidden folders, there is a message saying cannot copy this folder because its hidden, I don't remember the exact message but it was something like this. I had to manually copy the hidden files.
