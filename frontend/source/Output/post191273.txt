ApplescriptObjC [Output Box] <body> I would like to add a box to my applescriptobjc application. I would like to add a box that displays the output of   precode    do shell script "" /code/pre  so I think I would do something like  precode    set a too (do shell script "") /code/pre  But how would I show "a" in a box on the User Interface?  <answer191343> I believe this is what you want. Run the code in a Cocoa/AppleScript applet template in Script Editor and try it out.  precodeset a to do shell script "echo monkey" set window_rect to current application's NSMakeRect(40, 40, 500, 500) set window_1 to current application's NSWindow's alloc's initWithContentRect:window_rect styleMask:15 backing:2 defer:false set text_field to current application's NSTextField's new text_field's setEditable:false text_field's setDrawsBackground:false text_field's setStringValue:a window_1's setCollectionBehavior:(current application's NSWindowCollectionBehaviorFullScreenPrimary) window_1's setContentView:text_field window_1's setBackgroundColor:(current application's NSColor's blackColor) window_1's makeKeyAndOrderFront:(current application's NSApp) /code/pre  <comment227190> From this and other question you need to look at dome ObjC tutorials or books
