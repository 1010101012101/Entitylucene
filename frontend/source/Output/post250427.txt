Can't reinstall Mac OS X El Capitan because the only partition is a locked OS X Base Image taking up the full HDD <body> I'm trying to reinstall Mac OS X El Capitan on a new Macbook Air. Disk Utility lists a single SSD with a capacity of 251GB and a single partition (OS X Base system) that is taking up 250.4GB. When I try to create another partition it says that I need to enable journaling, but the option is greyed out. I also can't reinstall from the internet because the OS X Base System partition is locked.  Any ideas?

The content of emBase OS X/em probably got copied to your main volume somehow. Booted to this volume, any attempt to erase the disk or volume will fail.  hr  To solve your problem boot to Internet Recovery Mode (hold kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while booting) and open emDisk Utility/em.  Choose the superior SSD disk (and not the inferior volume) and hit the erase button. Choose a name, OS X Extended (journaled) and the GUID partition scheme.  If this fails for whatever reason open emTerminal/em in the menubar Utilities  Terminal. Enter codediskutil list/code to get the disk identifier of the internal disk (probably disk0 - below I assume it's disk0)  Then enter codediskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ "Macintosh HD" disk0/code. If this fails also, hammer the stubborn SSD with either:  precodediskutil umountDisk disk0 gpt detroy disk0 gpt create -f disk0 /code/pre  or   precodediskutil umountDisk disk0 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=4096 count=6 /code/pre  Be sure that it's disk0 though!  Now enter codeexit/code and quit emTerminal/em. Open emDisk Utility/em again and partition the disk like described previously.  Quit emDisk Utility/em and in the Utilities window open emRestore OS X/em and follow the instructions..   <comment310955> Please boot to (Internet) Recovery Mode, open Terminal.app in the menubar Utilities  Terminal.app. Enter `gpt -r show disk0` and `df`, take a pic (with a phone/camera) and add it to your question <comment310967> Alright, added to question. <comment310978> If you didn't do it already, with `Internet Recovery  Utilities  Disk Utility`, select your physical SSD and run a `First Aid`. Eventually turn down the `â–º Show Details`.  I suspect your SSD (`disk0`) to have problems. <comment310989> @Keysmack Your Recovery HD somehow vanished (it should be a third partition in the 158692 blocks gap following disk0s2). Boot to Internet Recovery Mode (alt-cmd-R) and try to erase the main disk (not the volume1) with Disk Utility. Then reinstall OS X
