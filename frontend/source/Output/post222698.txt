Why code lines in Xcode 7.2 are cutting some times? <body> Sometimes, while using Xcode 7.2, when I scrolls up-down or when I select a code block or shrink the if/else block, my screen is seen as following image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zkl12.png" alt="enter image description here"  Due to this problem, sometimes, I cannot edit code in-between the already written code. I had to restart Xcode every-time. In code line column, you can see in the image that line numbers are overlapped.  Please help me, I am facing this issue after I have upgraded my Xcode to 7.2  Thanks in Advance !!
