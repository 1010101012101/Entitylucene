no key repeat in Xquartz (x11) <body> I don't think I've used x11 since switching to Mountain Lion (and thus Xquartz).  I recently tried to use it and my key repeat isn't working.  When I press a key, it inserts the corresponding character once, then a second time after (very roughly) a quarter second, then never repeats again.  I've tried codexset r/code and codexset r on/code from both my x11 terminal, and normal Terminal.app --- neither has any effect.  Any suggestions?  <answer105916> From @jaykru on SuperUser.SO (https://superuser.com/a/414513/152522):      Did some more searching and discovered in recent updates the key   repeat rate for x in OS X is set at some odd value. Anyway, to whoever   else may have this issue, run this in your shell:  precode    xset r rate &lt;milliseconds_before_repeat&gt; &lt;repeats_per_second&gt; /code/pre      Or just codexset r rate/code to reset the keyboard repeat rate to default X   settings (i.e: something sane.)   <comment217396> i can't get xinitrc to not choke on xset's. <comment262839> Where should I put this setting? <comment262866> @mcb you run it in the terminal <comment262900> @DilithiumMatrix: Every time? Is there no way to have this set automatically? <comment262905> @mcb That sets the default value. <comment262907> @DilithiumMatrix: Really? It does not stay the same for me when I close XQuartz.app.
