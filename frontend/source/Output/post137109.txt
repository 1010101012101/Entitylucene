How to record human voice and display as text on command line? <body> I am looking tool or a script that records human voice and displays as text empurely/em on command line.  I am not looking for text to speech, but rather speech to text.  I do not want to work at all with a UI; all command line.  strongEDIT :/strong   I am actually saying to record voice (speech) and displays on terminal.  Say my command is 'speak'  then when i do   precode$ speak /code/pre  now whatever i speak is supposed to be printed like this.  say i speak. "I am application to record your voice and displays on the terminal"  should be visible as this :  precode$speak I am application to record your voice and displays on the terminal /code/pre  It should again wait for new words and print on the go.  Very similar as google does (BUT i want the same on command line) : https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html  You can consider the same as VICE-VERCA of codesay/code command. codesay/code is codetext-to-speech/code but here i want codespeech-to-text/code  <answer207374> Apple's terminal does this.  Press the function key twice to start dictation. If that doesn't work, open Speech and Dictation system preferences and enable it/select the sound input you prefer to dictate to.  <comment162839> that is interesting. so how do you intend to speak the special symbols  in the command line ? <comment162850> hi, please see my edit <comment162931> So you want it to only display the spoken text, or you want it to execute commands based on spoken words. <comment187289> Can You use builtin Dictation? I am able to dictate text into Terminal with this. Press twice `Fn` key to start dictation. <comment250103> Absolutely, I use this feature all the time
