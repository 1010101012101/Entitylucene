Editing $PATH variable for apache on mountain lion <body> I've just installed ImageMagick using macports and am trying to use it from a php site running on Apache, but nothing I do works to add /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin to my path.  So far I've tried  ul liadding an export to .bash_profile (macports already did this for me)/li liadding an environment variable declaration to or.apache.httpd.plist, which totally overwrites the path (using $PATH to refer to the previous path doesn't get recognised)/li liredefining the PATH in /usr/sbin/envvars/li liusing export in /usr/sbin/envvars/li liusing setenv in launchd.conf/li liusing export in launchd.conf/li liadding to the list in /etc/paths/li /ul  Any ideas  <comment104972> Is this the standard apache/php included in OS X or did you install a MAMP distribution (and if yes, which one)? Does IM work if you specify the full path from within your PHP code or if you symlink the binaries to `/usr/bin` for testing? <comment105092> It is the standard OSX apache and PHP. Symlinks was a fantastic idea and works perfectly (why doesn't macports do this for me?! I thought the whole point was that it avoids your having to muck around with stuff like this)
