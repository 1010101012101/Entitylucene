Can this RAM work with iMac 2010? <body> http://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Information-Ddr3-So-dimm-jm1333ksn-2g/dp/B007I5CMGK  It said it is a code2gb Ddr3 1333 So-dimm/code, is iMac support all codeDdr3 1333 So-dimm/code?  <answer139728> From iMac (Mid 2010: Memory specifications):     The iMac (Late 2010) computers have four SDRAM slots in the bottom of   the computer and come with at least 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM installed as two   2GB DIMMs into two slots.       The maximum amount of RAM you can install in your computer is 16 GB (a   4 GB SO-DIMM in each slot).      You can use any Small-Outline dual inline memory modules (SO-DIMMS)   that meet all of these criteria:      ul   liPC3-10600/li   liUnbuffered/li   liNonparity/li   li204-pin/li   li1333 MHz/li   liDDR3 SDRAM/li   /ul      You can use RAM module sizes of 2 GB or 4 GB in each slot.
