Password change from command line gone wrong <body> I changed my password by command line in Mac doing:  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist dscl . passwd /Users/cchilders /code/pre  Now I get codeLogin incorrect/code where the terminal won't open.   Notepad won't open:  precodeApplication Specific Information: libcoreservices: _dirhelper_userdir: 348: access: /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00001ym0000gn/: No such file or directory Could not obtain valid temporary directory for sandboxed app: Input/output error (5); returned size: 0 /code/pre  I can't change any settings about my user from system preferences (unapproved caller). What can I do to fix this Mac?  <comment318635> Use the passwd command instead of dscl. Also, changing your password from Recovery is safer.
