Can I connect my MacBook Pro DisplayPort to a Thunderbolt iMac to use as a display? <body> I have a MacBook Pro with Mini DisplayPort and I want to use target display mode to use a Thunderbolt iMac as an external display. If this works, would I need a Mini DisplayPort cable or a Thunderbolt cable?  <answer40951> According to this source, you won't be able to do that. You have to have a Thunderbolt Mac and use a Thunderbolt cable to use a Thunderbolt iMac as an external display. This other source has a table that confirms it. Sorry!  <comment46355> Yep. Just to confirm, I've tried it and it doesn't work. Although the connectors are physically the same, the protocols are incompatible.
