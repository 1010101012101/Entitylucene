Mac OS Desktop coordinate problem <body> I'm having a hard time working with Mac OS screen coordinates.  I can use strong⌘+⇧+4/strong to get them, but each of my monitors does not have a unique coordinate system??!?  I have a desktop of 4 screens arranged in a 2x2 pattern. Each screen has a size of (2048 pixels x 1152 pixels).  (And the Apple Menu Bar is on the top-left screen).  strong⌘+⇧+4/strong gives the upper-left of each screen as (0,0) and the lower right as (2048,1152).  But each screen does that!  Technically, the coordinate system "should" run from (0,0) to (4096,2304). How do I differentiate the coordinates of the individual monitors?  Furthermore, when I create a window at (500,500) it creates it in the top-left monitor at (500,652)  So I just don't understand what's going on. How can I get an accurate coordinate map for the Mac OS desktop with multiple monitors?  <answer5131> If you have Developer Tools installed, you could try running codePixie.app/code and configuring that to give you coordinates. It might calculate them differently.  <comment5212> So it does! Thanks! <comment5213> *when I create a window at (500,500) it creates it in the top-left monitor at (500,652)* how are you “creating” a window? maybe if you give us some more insight about what the problem is? :) <comment5215> @Martin, well, I'm using a `MAAttachedWindow` but it sets the origin of the window's frame to (500,500). <comment5217> oh I see, the famous Matt’s window :) I believe that the best place to go for this kind of advice might be stackoverflow.com as more programmers roam that place. I do program in Cocoa/Obj-C but I have never used MAAttachedWindow (tho it looks cool!) <comment5239> Huh, there's an app I'd never heard of before. Awesome. +1 for unintentional discovery. <comment370423> On a Retina Screen, it looks like Pixie gives much higher coordinates than CMD + SHIFT + 4 (~1330 on width instead of around ~670). It still might be useful but just pointing it out.
