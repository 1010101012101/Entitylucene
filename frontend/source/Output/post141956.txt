Apt-get install tomcat7 <body> I am currently running Mavericks. I have a Drupal7 Virtual Machine running (on VirtualBox). I am trying to install a tomcat7 server onto the VM. I have used the Terminal to SSH and login to my Drupal7 VM but cannot seem to install tomcat7. I am aware that on Windows you use the command: apt-get install tomcat7, however this doesn't work on Mac.  I have tried to use Homebrew, but it doesn't seem to install on the VM through the terminal command.  Does anyone have any advice?  Thanks!  <answer141991> To install Apache Tomcat on Debian, follow the instructions provided by Digital Ocean: How To Install and Configure Apache Tomcat on a Debian Server.  The two steps are:  precodesudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install tomcat7 /code/pre  Installing Tomcat on your virtual machine does not require Mac OS X specific commands. Your installation is taking place within the virtual machine and all the commands should be Debian specific.  <comment167284> What operating system is the virtual machine running? <comment167312> It running Debian 64bit - can i be using host-only adapter? <comment167314> thanks, i will try that late. Can i be using host-only adapter as when i try to use bridged network i get:'error optaining ip address, lease failed, failed to bring up eth0' when assigned an ip address to the vm <comment167318> @jake12321 please can you ask this as a separate VirtualBox on Mac question. That way you will attract better, more specific, and hopefully more informed answers.
