G4 files moving to 10.6.8 <body> Coming out of the dark ages....moving my stuff from my old G4 PowerPC 10.5.8 to my recently-inherited MBP with 10.6.8 (intel).    How can I move files from the old G4 to the newer MBP?  I can't use TimeMachine &amp; my new Seagate backup plus because it requires 10.6 or higher.  Can't use MobileMe because it requires 10.6 or higher.  Thumb drive file transfer is slow and painful.  <answer79656> I believe there's Migrate Assistant or stuff like that.  Can you use that? It's slow, but you just gonna have to live with that.  You can of course transfer through network, but I doubt if that will be faster than USB/WiFi.  Another option is to take the drive off. Which is what I won't do since I don't think it's designed so.  <answer79724> I'd recommend that you use Firewire target disk mode.  From article "How to use and troubleshoot FireWire target disk mode" (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1661):     FireWire target disk mode allows a Macintosh computer with a FireWire   port (the target computer) to be used as an external hard disk   connected to another computer (the host). Once a target computer is   started up as a FireWire hard disk and is available to the host   computer, you can copy files to or from that volume.   You basically need to:  ul liConnect both computers with a Firewire cable./li liStart your G4 Mac while pressing the T key until a FireWire icon appears./li liWait until a firewire drive icon appears on your MBP's desktop. Open the drive and copy what you need (probably in code/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/code)./li liWhen you're done, eject the drive as usual (kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdE/kbd or drag it to the recycle bin) and power your G4 Mac off./li /ul  <comment92005> Won't the Seagate drive  work on 10.5 just as a drive? OK the extra software won't but you should just be able to copy data/
