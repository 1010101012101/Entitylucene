I just want to use the flag code-P/code for Perl regex that is found in GNU grep, but not in BSD grep.   My PATH is code/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/texbin:/Users/masi/.cabal/bin/code so I have coreutils first in the PATH.
