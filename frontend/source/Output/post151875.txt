How to downgrade to Maverics with Time Machine <body> I've just "upgraded" to Yosemite, but I really hate the design and I want to go back to Maverics. I have a copy of my MBA in Time Machine (made before upgrade). My question is - how to downgrade and bring back everything to the state before upgrade?  <comment178663> Do you also have a Mavericks Installer package? <comment178783> @Buscarì›ƒ No, I don't. <comment178906> Well unless you backed Mavericks up as well, you will need one.
