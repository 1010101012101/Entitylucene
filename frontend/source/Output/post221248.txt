Can't see FAT32 and NTFS external partitions on OS X El Capitan when SIP is enabled <body> I've installed Homebrew, FUSE for OS X and NTFS-3G. It helped to see external partitions (FAT32 and NTFS) when SIP is disabled (OS X El Capitan).  But when SIP is enabled, I can't see NTFS and FAT32 external partitions in Finder and Disk Utility. When I run command codediskutil list/code in a Terminal, it shows all partitions, including NTFS and FAT32.  What should I do now to read/write with SIP enabled?  Output from diskutil list:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            499.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +499.0 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  DD75E058-1FC0-4B05-B0F2-FB02A06EC189                                  Unencrypted /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                80.9 GB    disk2s2    3:                  Apple_HFS osxboot                 53.2 GB    disk2s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data NF                      365.6 GB   disk2s4 /code/pre  After command 'diskutil info /Volumes/NF' Result was 'Could not find disk: /Volumes/NF'  <answer221286> The reason that FUSE will not run with SIP enabled, is that (amongst other things) SIP blocks changes to the code/sbin/code filesystem location by default and this is where the "mount_XXXX" executable lives.  Instead of turning SIP off completely you can disable just the part that protects the filesystem support by running the following command in a recovery console.     csrutil enable --without fs   This is the recommended way to get the NTFS module working in FUSE by the people who maintain OSXFUSE.  Note that the command will give you the following warning but it will work for now.     csrutil: requesting an unsupported configuration. This is likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.   <comment267903> Since you're using NTFS I'll assume you have a Windows system that you can attach the external drives to and run `chkdsk /f drive letter:` on from an Administrator Command Prompt, e.g., `chkdsk /f e:`  and then try mounting again under OS X.  This will ensure there are no issue with the filesystem, which under some circumstances may cause them not to mount properly. <comment267955> thanks, for advice - I did what you've suggested, but nothing has changed.  Both partitions has normally functioning file systems. Anyway, now I'll know how to fix file system on Win :) <comment268050> I did as you recommended, and I've got this: System Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration).  Configuration:  Apple Internal: disabled  Kext Signing: enabled  Filesystem Protections: disabled  Debugging Restrictions: enabled  DTrace Restrictions: enabled  NVRAM Protections: enabled  This is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.' But still I can't see neither ntfs nor fat32 partition. <comment268055> So they still appear okay under `diskutil list` but don't appear in Disk Utility? Could you add the output of the `diskutil list` command to your question? <comment268076> I've added diskutil list to my question. <comment268095> @ade What happens if you just type `open /Volumes/NF` or `open /Volumes/BOOTCAMP` in a Terminal window? <comment268166> When I write those commands, I'm getting the answers: 'the file  /Volumes/NF does not exist' and 'the file  /Volumes/BOOTCAMP does not exist' respectively. <comment268169> Could you run `distutil info /Volumes/NF` and paste the output into your question? <comment268510> I've added distutil info /Volumes/NF output to my question
