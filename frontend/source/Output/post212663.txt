Keyboard shortcut (App Shortcut) taken? Cannot use "^Z" <body> When I try to add a Shortcut like this  System Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts-App Shortcuts-+-Some title-  I cannot use code^Z/code as Keyboard Shortcut. It is automatically replaced by   ol liShift (illustrated as arrow-up)br followed by/li liCommand (illustrated by the Command key symbol) followed by a/li licodeY/code/li /ol  I guess this is because the shortcut is taken. But I couldn't find where. I checked all the other item above "App Shortcuts", i.e. "Accessibility", "Spotlight", ...  How can I check which app is using it and how can I force the system to use my shortcut?  <answer212666> just a guessâ€¦ but sounds like something might have a custom map to "Undo" because Cmd/z &amp; Cmd/shift/Y are alternates for Undo.   For it to be auto-replacing inside system prefs would make me think it is not a system key command, but a third party, Karabiner, TypeIt4Me etc  <comment256873> Yes, you were right. For others having the same problem: check karabiner, and BetterSnapTool
