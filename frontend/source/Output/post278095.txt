Time Machine unable to get files <body> I just reinstalled macOs on my Macbook pro, fresh install on a fresh new partition.   The thing is : I usually go on a folder with Finder, and launch Time Machine to get files and folders back. When I want to do this now, Time Machine can't go on the previous states of a folder.   I mean : I see the previous states, dates on the timeline, but when I click on it, nothing happens. Same with up/down keys.  Any ideas?  <comment349968> Have you tried drilling down to the selected folder starting from Macintosh HD? (e.g. Macintosh HD/Users/enguerranws/Documents/Folder_of_Stuff <comment349970> Yes, nothing happens wherever I try to use Time Machine. <comment349971> I also tried unmount / mount Time Machine's disk. <comment350069> Can you clarify what you're trying to achieve overall? Is it that you want to migrate data across from a TM backup because you've just done a fresh install of macOS? Or are you trying to restore something specific from TM? Something else? <comment350075> I'm trying to get my files (from a previous install) back (using Finder and choose the files / folders I need) from my TM on a fresh install of macOs.
