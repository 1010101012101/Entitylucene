Configure BetterTouchTool to change spaces with a mouse button modifier? <body> I just picked up a Logitech MX Revolution mouse and am trying to map some actions for moving  between spaces.  There's a button on the mouse just above the thumb. I want to press that thumb button + tilt scrollwheel right to move to the right space, and the reverse to move to the left space.  I cant see a way to assign key combos/custom modifiers in BetterTouchTool. I can set the thumb button to change spaces, or the scroll wheel, or a common keyboard modifier (shift etc), but not the combo of the two.  I'm not married to the app so whatever can accomplish this task I'll give a go. :)  Thanks for the help!
