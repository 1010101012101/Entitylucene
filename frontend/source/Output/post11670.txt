Changing your path variable <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Adding gedit to my PATH       I'm very new to OSX.  I installed Ruby with HomeBrew, and the rubygems installer said that I should add a certain path (code/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.2-p180/bin/code) to my PATH variable.  Great, I obviously don't know how to do that, so I used the advice on this site.  However, I assume I messed it up completely, because I think that is the only thing contained in my PATH variable.  For example, codels/code doesn't work in terminal anymore - I'm guessing that's because it's contained in a folder that used to be included in PATH and now is not.  If I type codeecho $PATH/code I only get the one directory back (code/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.2-p180/bin/code).    Have I completely stuffed it now?  Can I get it back?  And how the hell do you edit your path variable?
