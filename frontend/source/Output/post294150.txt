Is there a tmp directory that gets cleaned when user logs out or logs in? <body> Looking at building a custom parser in AppleScript that would run throughout the day with codelaunchd/code.  The issue I'm looking at is trying to find what codetmp/code directory to store the parse at that would be cleaned after log in or log out.  After searching it would appear codetmp/code directories are only wiped on the reboot.  If I can run a clean on log in or log out that would save on performance trying to condition when to run under a wipe.  When I research the topic I've found Temporary Items that details:  precodepath to temporary items path to temporary items from user domain /private/var/folders  /tmp /private/tmp /var/private/tmp /code/pre  but that doesn't mention wether or not a log out/in wipes the directories.  Diving deeper I found AppleScript has a tmp option from Where to write temporary with:  precodepath to temporary items from user domain /code/pre  Searching the site I've found:  ul liHow long does the ios clean tmp directory?/li liSaving /private/tmp/li /ul  Is there a directory on a Mac that is cleans on a system running Maverick, Yosemite and Sierra that will be cleaned after a log in/out that doesn't require system admin approval?  <answer294235> codepath to temporary items/code or codepath to temporary items from user,local or system domain/code: there is no difference because this folder is not in the home folder.  I tested this by creating a folder named "strongxyz/strong" in the temporary items, log out and log in, the "strongxyz/strong" folder was moved to the Trash.
