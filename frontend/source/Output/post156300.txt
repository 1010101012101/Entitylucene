Is there any software for checking hardware in iOS? <body> Is there anything like this in iOS for iDevices ? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o51ep.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer156328> There is an free app called SensorMonitor, available from the AppStore, that can be used to check the functionality of various sensors in an iPhone/iPad, for example the compass, accelerometer, etc.  Description taken from the AppStore:     Description IMPORTANT : Currently, Sensor Monitor doesn't support   iOS8.      Sensor Monitor displays several sensor raw value of your device. and   log, use for development!      Also, 'Send over UDP' is available!      available sensor : magnetometer,gps, gyroscope,accelerometer,   battery,proximity, mic level, touch   A couple of screen shots:  emThe Accelerometer and Gyroscope Screen/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kg86l.jpg" alt="Accelerometer and Gyroscope"  emThe GPS Screen/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CjQL2.jpg" alt="GPS"  Admittedly, it unfortunately does not provide checks for most of the hardware that you mentioned (namely the backlight, ringtone, vibrator or camera).  h3Update August 2017/h3  As per the comment, the app seems to be no longer available.  This was the icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uJhwT.png" alt="Sensor Monitor icon"  This is the about box:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wh5dr.png" alt="Sensor Monitor about"  Maybe you can contact the developer at fuzz@fuzz-tech.com.  Here is a web site about the app, Sensor Monitor. It does not support iOS 8, unfortunately.  <answer166427> strongPhone Doctor Plus/strong has many diagnostics for the hardware.   iTunes link:  https://appsto.re/us/GXURH.i  <answer166477> Contact Apple. They can send/text you a free diagnostics file to make sure everything is working fine.  <answer166500> This question &amp; top answer are very relevant.  Basically "yes", but not so much from a customer / end user standpoint.  iOS has a diagnostics tool built in that is accessible from Apple once you give consent.  You can check your iOS device's health using Apple's main support site.  From that page you can select iPhone (or iPad), find an issue that would warrant running the diagnostic (I chose power, unexpected shutdown/restart), verify that a restore didn't resolve the issue and then enter your phone number / email address to start the diagnostic process.  Apple will text / email you a link to open.  The link opens the iOS diagnostic tool, which requires you to click through a legal agreement before starting the test.  The test results are sent back to Apple once they finish and you tap "done".  Back on the support site the page will refresh and show any issues that were found with the device as well as support options for resolving them.  <answer262717> For IOS function check, you can download free app Phone diagnostics from app store: https://itunes.apple.com/vn/app/phone-diagnostics/id1171677218?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4  It's easy to use: just launch the app and click on each function test buttons to perform the test.  <comment183834> thnx for your reply 1+ , but it's not very well or complete I'm looking for something strong <comment195048> Apologies. I have updated my answer with more information, but admittedly, the app does not fulfill all of your requirements. I have used this app myself to check/verify second hand iPhones. However, I must admit that an iPhone version of the Android app that you specify would be a handy addition to my checking tools. <comment352767> This answer is perfectly fine.  It contains all the information it needs.  If someone doesn't believe it, they can call Apple themselves to confirm or refute.  I understand that "explanation and context" is often valuable.  But this isn't politics.  We don't need hot air just for its own sake. <comment370998> Is this application `SensorMonitor` still exist? I can't found it. <comment371070> @vlk - I have updated my answer with more information. Yes, I can not find it in the app store any more :-(
