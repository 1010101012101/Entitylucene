Screenshot reader for Mac <body> Is there a screenshot reader similar to ABBYY Screenshot Reader (you are just selecting area on the screen and getting text into the buffer, something like that)?  <answer219801> how about using FreeOCR? It works for PDF files, TIFF images and can turn image to word file.  <comment34342> Could you clarify the question ? Yo are looking for utility that will combine taking screenshots and then doing some sort of OCR so you can get editable text ? <comment34346> Related: [Simple, free OCR software (for OS X)?](http://superuser.com/q/9916) <comment34368> @Kassym Dorsel exactly! <comment34377> Get yourself some OCR software and set up folder actions to run screenshots thru the OCR after you take them. <comment265861> Might help if it wasn't Windows only - or do you have a Mac link? <comment266006> oh, sorry, you may search Prizmo, it works on Mac, but it's not for free.
