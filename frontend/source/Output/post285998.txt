iPad power button not working? <body> My iPad is unable to be turned off due to the power button not functioning, online forums said the solution was to add assistive touch to my home screen and use the lock screen button under the devices option. Even that wouldn't turn off my iPad, I have tried resetting it but that doesn't work. I don't understand why assistive touch wouldn't work. Should I do a factory reset in case it is a software problem?
