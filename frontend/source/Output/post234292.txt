Command-line tool to ask remote server for current date-time <body> On Mac OS X (such as 10.8 thru 10.11) is there a bundled command-line tool to ask a specific remote NTP time server for the current date-time?  I found codentpdc/code but this queries the codentpd/code utility which I assume means going through my already-defined NTP servers. I want to make a call outside of my pre-defined NTP servers.  Like this imaginary line where code-s/code means server-address:  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"codentpclient -s time.euro.apple.com current /code/pre  <answer234294> You can use codesntp/code as standard query tool for either NTP or SNTP servers. You may get, set or adjust the time on your host with it.  E.g.  precodesntp time.euro.apple.com /code/pre  shows the time  precodesntp -d time.euro.apple.com /code/pre  shows a more verbose response including the current time.  Check codeman sntp/code for more options.
