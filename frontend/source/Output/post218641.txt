How do I replace matched regular expression without including the final character in XCode? <body> I've got a number of places in files for a project with the following format: codefunc whatever() -&gt;Bool {/code.  However, it looks like the standard Swift guide is to use codefunc nevermind() -&gt; String/code (note the space between the code-&gt;/code and the start of the return type).  I am able to find all these instances by using codeRegular Expression/code option in the Replace sidebar with code-&gt;[^ ]/code.  However, this includes the first character of the return type.  What should I type in the replace field to insert a space without bothering the next non-space character?  <comment264319> Something like this is better suited for Stack Overflow, even though it's about app development for Apple products. You'll get better answers there. <comment264330> Any good way to copy this over to there without having to markup the formatting again? (I realised I could brute-force my way by matching all instances of `-` and replacing them with `- `, then matching any `-  ` to catch the ones that over-corrected).
