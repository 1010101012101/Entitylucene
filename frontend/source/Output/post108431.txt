My 2,5 year old Macbook Pro wakes from sleep every other hour after installing Mavericks <body> Okay so, I own a 2,5 year old (Early 2011) Macbook Pro which works just fine. After the release of Mavericks I decided to reinstall it from scratch since I had been upgrading it step-by-step since Snow Leopard and it would feel good to reinstall it from scratch.  Well, I did that a while back ago, and only yesterday did I remember that I had forgotten to install an IRC client. So, I installed Limechat which is what I normally use. Well, today at work, I realized that my computer at home was logging in to IRC every other hour just to get a ping timeout 3 minutes later. Hm, that's weird.  So, when I come home I find this every other hour in code/var/log/system.log/code (example has been cut for brevity):  precodeNov  5 14:30:50 pioneer kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake Nov  5 14:30:50 pioneer kernel[0]: Previous Sleep Cause: 5 Nov  5 14:30:50 pioneer WindowServer[126]: _CGXHWCaptureWindowList: No capable active display found.

So I figure it must either be something on my LAN that is waking it up through the wake-on-LAN mechanism, or something that runs locally on my Mac.  What do you guys think it could be?  <answer108457> Possibly you have a "Wake for network access" on in Power Saver preferences. This is a feature that works if you use "Find My Mac" feature with iCloud. Check that.  <comment127149> My 1.5 year old does that too! Wait, you mean your computer? <comment127181> Yeah, that box was checked. Do you know if it's checked by default in Mavericks? I tried unchecking it now anyways to see if changes anything. Will report back tomorrow! <comment127254> Sorry, I do not know if it is checked by default. I upgraded from ML.
