Console Mode from Desktop <body> With most linux distros you can hit control + alt + F1 or the like, and get a Console. This is really useful when your X11 / display manager freezes, because you can restart that process / service in a couple of seconds and be back in.  Is there a way to do the same thing with mac (10.8.2)? It's pretty annoying to see your display freeze and know that your kernel is likely chugging along just fine..  I looked around for answers, but all I could find is the login window hack.  Thanks!  <answer228062> No - not only can't you toggle this from your session once logged in, but you actually have to log out of all other graphical based user-sessions before the strongconsole/strong shortcut will work.  ul li&gt;console does not work/li /ul  <comment102843> Do you want quick access to a terminal, or a way to kill unresponsive programs? <comment102861> Restart the window server when it's unresponsive/ recovery terminal. I suppose I could run an ssh server and get into it from my phone or something, but that's a security risk and quite roundabout. <comment102880> Restarting the windowserver kills all GUI apps. How often do you find yourself in a situation where restarting the windowserver is required? Maybe there is another problem to be solved? In those cases a reboot probably would be better. <comment102885> @Gerry - _'Restarting the windowserver kills all GUI apps'_ right, but shouldn't kill things like GNU Screen or what have you. Probably right, just curious if there is a simple way. <comment278002> @pnovotnak it will kill screen as that would be launched from terminal which is killed. OS X != Linux <comment278019> Very good point, application would be parent process. For this to be useful you'd have to be careful to disown any processes you wanted to keep. Might as well get a VM for yourself at that point, since what you're looking for is redundant power. Furthermore, when I asked the question I had a spinning disk and boot took a few minutes. Can you even buy a Mac anymore without at least a hybrid drive?
