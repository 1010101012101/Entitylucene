"DefaultKeyBinding" Hex code for ML's "⌘ ⌘" Start Dictation command? <body> I have a set customized keyboard bindings located in a codeplist/code file at code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.Dict/code which works with Hex keys like..  code"\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:"; /* Home *//code  or for "Non-Printable Key Codes", like so..  Backtab ( kbd⇧/kbdkbdtab/kbd)   code\U0019/code  I'd like to add a new keyboard shortcut for the start dictation commands in Mountain lion, aka, kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌘/kbd.  Is there such a code?  Or is NSresponder making them up on the fly, other private magic, etc.?  <answer62971> Changing the actions of double-presses of modifier keys is probably impossible. There isn't even a code point for the fn key in CORPCHAR.TXT.  But if you're looking to add a different shortcut for toggling speech, you should be looking for method names instead of shortcut strings.  I tried using strings to find method names for starting dictation. codestartDictation:/code and codestartSpeechCaptureForDictation:/code seemed promising, but neither worked in codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code.  Even if you were able to change the shortcut in codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code, it wouldn't work in applications that don't support the customizable keybindings.  What's wrong with just changing it in System Preferences?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y24pJ.png" alt=""  If you want to use a shortcut that isn't allowed, you might be able to change codeCustomizedDictationHotKey/code in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs.plist/code.
