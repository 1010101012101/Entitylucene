How can I delete files in recovery mode using Terminal on my OS X main partition? <body> I need to delete a folder otherwise my mac won't boot. How can I do this in recovery mode or whatever it's called using Terminal commands?  <answer197534> Boot to recovery mode by immediately pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd after starting your Mac.  In the menu-bar open Utilities - Terminal  Enter codecd /Volumes/code then codels/code to list all mounted volumes.  Then enter codecd Volume_name/path/to/superior_directory/code with superior_directory: the directory containing the folder you want do delete.  Example: If you want to delete a folder "xyz" in "Macintosh HD" (the example name of your main volume) enter codecd "Macintosh HD"/code.  Then enter codels/code again to list all files and directories to be sure that you are in the correct working directory.  Then enter coderm -r folder_to_delete/code or coderm -rf folder_to_delete/codebr code-r/code: removes a folder and its content recursivelybr code-rf/code: force removes a folder and its content recursively  Example: If you want to delete a folder "xyz" and all containing files and folders enter: coderm -r xyz/code.  <comment268856> You'd think this would work but it does not.
