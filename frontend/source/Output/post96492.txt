Updating apps across multiple users <body> I have a MBP with the latest OSX (Lion).  I have three user accounts -- mine (admin), my wife and son (both Standard).    I install apps using my Admin account, but sometimes I have it where the Flash player (most recent example) needs to be updates and i can't just update it in the admin account and have it "roll out" to the other accounts.  I have to go to each and every account and repeat the update process.   Is there any way to change this?  Or, what am I doing wrong?  <comment113317> just fyi, Lion hasn't been the latest OSX for nearly a year...
