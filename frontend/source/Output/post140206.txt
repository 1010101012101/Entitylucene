Mailto: tag won't dissappear <body> I've had this problem a few times in the past. How do you get rid of a mailto: or alt tag that won't disappear delfrom the Google screen./del  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BqHF4.jpg" alt="mail to tag"  EDIT  @Buscar - it wasn't just Google, it was appearing over every window Chrome or otherwise.  <answer140208> I found a solution. kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd and left-clicking on the application (Chrome in my case) got rid of it for me.  <comment165323> @Patience it won't let me for 2 days.
