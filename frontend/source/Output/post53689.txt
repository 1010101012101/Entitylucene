Java3d applet won't render on Lion <body> I have no idea what's the problem, but Java3D isn't rendering in applets.  For example if I go to this page: http://www.java3d.org/howto.html and I see the first applet but not the second one.  Also the java console gives the the next code:   precodesecurity: property package.access value sun.,com.sun.xml.internal.ws.,com.sun.xml.internal.bind.,com.sun.imageio.,apple.,com.apple.mrj.,com.apple.jdirect.,com.apple.audio.jdirect.,quicktime.internal.,com.sun.medialib.mlib. security: property package.access new value sun.,com.sun.xml.internal.ws.,com.sun.xml.internal.bind.,com.sun.imageio.,apple.,com.apple.mrj.,com.apple.jdirect.,com.apple.audio.jdirect.,quicktime.internal.,com.sun.medialib.mlib.,com.sun.javaws security: property package.access value sun.,com.sun.xml.internal.ws.,com.sun.xml.internal.bind.,com.sun.imageio.,apple.,com.apple.mrj.,com.apple.jdirect.,com.apple.audio.jdirect.,quicktime.internal.,com.sun.medialib.mlib.,com.sun.javaws security: property package.access new value sun.,com.sun.xml.internal.ws.,com.sun.xml.internal.bind.,com.sun.imageio.,apple.,com.apple.mrj.,com.apple.jdirect.,com.apple.audio.jdirect.,quicktime.internal.,com.sun.medialib.mlib.,com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy security: property package.access value sun.,com.sun.xml.internal.ws.,com.sun.xml.internal.bind.,com.sun.imageio.,apple.,com.apple.mrj.,com.apple.jdirect.,com.apple.audio.jdirect.,quicktime.internal.,com.sun.medialib.mlib.,com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy security: property package.access new value sun.,com.sun.xml.internal.ws.,com.sun.xml.internal.bind.,com.sun.imageio.,apple.,com.apple.mrj.,com.apple.jdirect.,com.apple.audio.jdirect.,quicktime.internal.,com.sun.medialib.mlib.,com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy,com.sun.jnlp security: property package.definition value null security: property package.definition new value com.sun.javaws security: property package.definition value com.sun.javaws security: property package.definition new value com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy security: property package.definition value com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy security: property package.definition new value com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy,com.sun.jnlp security: property package.access value sun.,com.sun.xml.internal.ws.,com.sun.xml.internal.bind.,com.sun.imageio.,apple.,com.apple.mrj.,com.apple.jdirect.,com.apple.audio.jdirect.,quicktime.internal.,com.sun.medialib.mlib.,com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy,com.sun.jnlp security: property package.access new value sun.,com.sun.xml.internal.ws.,com.sun.xml.internal.bind.,com.sun.imageio.,apple.,com.apple.mrj.,com.apple.jdirect.,com.apple.audio.jdirect.,quicktime.internal.,com.sun.medialib.mlib.,com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy,com.sun.jnlp,org.mozilla.jss security: property package.definition value com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy,com.sun.jnlp security: property package.definition new value com.sun.javaws,com.sun.deploy,com.sun.jnlp,org.mozilla.jss basic: Added progress listener: sun.plugin.util.GrayBoxPainter$GrayBoxProgressListener@609903f4 basic: Added progress listener: sun.plugin.util.GrayBoxPainter$GrayBoxProgressListener@6536d9d8 network: Cache entry not found [url: http://www.java3d.org/, version: null] network: Cache entry found [url: http://www.java3d.org/AJava3dApplet.class, version: null] prevalidated=false/0 network: Connecting http://www.java3d.org/AJava3dApplet.class with proxy=DIRECT network: Connecting http://www.java3d.org:80/ with proxy=DIRECT network: ResponseCode for http://www.java3d.org/AJava3dApplet.class : 304 network: Encoding for http://www.java3d.org/AJava3dApplet.class : null network: Disconnect connection to http://www.java3d.org/AJava3dApplet.class network: Cache entry not found [url: http://www.java3d.org/, version: null] network: Cache entry found [url: http://www.java3d.org/AnApplet.class, version: null] prevalidated=false/0 network: Connecting http://www.java3d.org/AnApplet.class with proxy=DIRECT network: Connecting http://www.java3d.org:80/ with proxy=DIRECT network: ResponseCode for http://www.java3d.org/AnApplet.class : 304 network: Encoding for http://www.java3d.org/AnApplet.class : null network: Disconnect connection to http://www.java3d.org/AnApplet.class basic: Applet loaded. basic: Applet loaded. basic: Applet resized and added to parent container basic: PERF: AppletExecutionRunnable - applet.init() BEGIN ;

Safari, Firefox, and Google Chrome behave the same.  I've successfully launched Java App with Graphics3D but applet won't show up. I'll be very thankful for a solution.  <answer60665> Ok, so the problem is that new Java plugin2 does not support Java3D and JOGL: source.  <comment61437> "If you can't see a red ball in a black square, you need to install Java 3D". Did you install it? I guess you did, because apps work. But maybe you installed it in a way that the applet plugin cannot see it? <comment61438> Maybe also try Stackoverflow <comment61443> @Thilo applet can see it. Because I had exceptions first and then when I moved the **j3d** files into the correct locations app started to launch. But I can't see the 3D content.
