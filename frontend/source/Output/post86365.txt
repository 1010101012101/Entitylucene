Enable OS X Mail editing toolbar <body> Some time ago somebody helped me to know how to display the OS X Mail strongmessage editing/strong toolbar. Please note, this is not the main Mail toolbar, but appears on the message window. I did not record the steps, but I recall it is very simple. I would like to know how to enable that on a new computer.  Please look at the screen shot to see the toolbar that I am talking about. It is easy to find a ton of information about customizing the main toolbar. But I cannot find anything about enabling this one.  The toolbar in question is the bottom-most of the three toolbars shown, and has "Helvetica" visible in the first drop down.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLTpJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer86367> Just clic on the strongA/strong on the top right of your message window.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SYcm1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment100142> How could I miss that! And twice! Doh! <comment100155> Don't forget to mark the question as answered ;)
