Moving email from Gmail to Mail.app locally <body> I have a large amount of email in Gmail, the account is at 99% capacity. I'd like to remove this from Gmail and only store it locally. Using mail.app When I drag the message from a Gmail mailbox into a local folder the message still appears on Gmail.  How can I move the messages locally so they don't appear in Gmail anymore?  Thanks,  <answer30926> I'm guessing you might need to manually delete the messages in Gmail as well. I'm not familiar with copying mail to a local folder, but I do know that Gmail is VERY protective of keeping its mail within its service as much as possible.  That would be the best advice I can offer.  <comment35503> How did you set up the local folder, does it appear under "Local"? <comment35505> Yes, I created a mailbox on my Mac and dragged the message from a folder in gmail to the local mailbox. <comment35520> Strange, when I drag stuff from Gmail-Local in Mail.app 5.1, it disappears from Gmail... I have to hold down Cmd if I want to copy it.
