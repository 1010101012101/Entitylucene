Rules for Spotlight search (on osx 10.8) <body> I absolutely do not understand the rules that Spotlight (osx 10.8) uses to search my files. If I enter the query codesbml/code and select codefilename/code from the dropdown menu, these are the results that come up:  precodeBIOMD0000000051_SBML-L2V4.xml runImmdeath_noSBML.py runp53_noSBML.py SBMLParser.py /code/pre  but if I chose the query codelibsbml/code instead, this is the only result I get:  precodelibsbml-5.6.0-libxml2-macosx-lion.dmg /code/pre  Now, I wouldn't expect the first four answers to come up on the second search, but why does a search for codesbml/code not turn up codelibsbml-5.6.0-libxml2-macosx-lion.dmg/code? Clearly, codesbml/code doesn't have to be the first 4 letters in the filename, nor the last 4 before the extension. So what is the deal?  <answer80800> I rans a few tests in 10.8.2. My empirical results show that spotlight returns results for partial matches when the start of the name matches, but not any part of the name. I have not found a way to change this.  I have another challenge with multiple word searches. My empirical experience is that a filename search containing multiple words (separated by spaces) yields results only if the search words are contiguous in the filename. For example:  Given some files with these names:br xxx rules and roles yyy.zzzbr aaa roles and rules bbb.ccc    ul lia search for {roles} or {rules} will find both filesbr (note: the braces are included here for clarity; they are not part of the search string)/li lia search for {rules and roles} will find the first file only;/li lia search for {roles and rules} will find the second file only;/li lia search for {roles rules} or {rules roles} will find nothing;/li /ul  I find this last behaviour frustrating, as I don't want to have to remember the word order in my filenames. And one-word searches get too many hits.  Anyone with answers for this?  <comment105764> interesting (and frustrating)! but this isn't an answer, more like a comment or extra info... <comment125195> This is really annoying.
