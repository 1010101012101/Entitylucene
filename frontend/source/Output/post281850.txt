Can editline offer colorized output similar to GNU readline's `colorized-stats`? <body> I'm looking to colorize autocomplete output in bash in macOS. If I installed GNU coreutils, I suppose I could use codecolorized-stats/code with GNU's readline and newer bash. Looking at codeeditline/code and codeeditrc/code man pages, it seems that custom coloring is possible with libedit and editline, but not directly supported.  Similar to: [Unix &amp; Linux] is there a way to set coloring for cd tab complete?  I also saw this one, didn't try the linked patch: [Stack Overflow] How to colorize the prompt of an editline application
