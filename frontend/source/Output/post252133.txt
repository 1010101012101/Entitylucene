Can iTunes auto play a song related to the one I've just listened to (not in a playlist)? <body> Is there a way to let iTunes automatically play a song after listening to a song I searched (not a part of a playlist), supposedly a "related" song?  I'm aiming for something like Youtube's "Up next" feature, also available on Soundcloud.  <answer252279> So, apparently that's the radio / station feature. Just need to click the three dots button of a song and select codeStart Station/code.  Thing is, that button (codeStart Station/code) was grayed out for me. According to a random suggestion I found here, I was able to solve it by deleting the preferences file from my library (code%USERPROFILE%\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\.iTunes Preferences.plist/code on Windows 10).
