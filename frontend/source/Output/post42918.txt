unable to run ddd on mac <body> I am trying to install ddd debugger on my MAC. It installed fine, however when I try to run it I get the following error:  precodebash-3.2$ ddd test Error: No `Ddd' application defaults file To resolve this problem, you can:  set the XAPPLRESDIR environment variable to the location of the file `Ddd', or set the DDD_HOME environment variable to the location of `ddd/Ddd', or install the `Ddd' file in the X application defaults directory, or recompile DDD with builtin app-defaults file; see the `--enable-builtin-app-defaults' option for details. /code/pre  I have X11 installed in my utilities folder. It works coz i use xterm on it quite often.  any ideas how to fix this?? anything I need to add to ./configure or make commands while installing ddd ???  <answer68787> I was able to fix this from some hints from this site.   After installing, you run the configure command again. This will create the Ddd file in the ddd folder. Now you can follow any of the steps that are printed out, I personally used the DDD_HOME variable with the patch to the sourcecode directory of ddd, since Ddd is now in $DDD_HOME/ddd/Ddd.   <comment48806> WHat are the values of the variables in the error? and where is Ddd installed? <comment48807> Hi mark   i downloaded ddd in my Downloads folder and ran the `./configure && make` command there.  as for the variable i am not sure how to find out the values. I am a noob at programming. If you could tell me how to find out i will report back to you <comment48813> If new why not use Xcode as much easier to setup and use?
