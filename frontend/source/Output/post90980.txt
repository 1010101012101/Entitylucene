Can Applescript ask for the names of the people you want to send to and fill this in send to <body> Iâ€™d like to be able to send to people from my address book where a dialogue would say who would you like to send the email to and I would write in like peter, john, George etc and that would populate my send to field and then I would write the email and send it to these people.  Kerry  <answer91524> This should do what you asked for. It will ask you to choose from a list if the user name you enter matches more than one contact and also if the selected contact has more than one email address to choose from.  precodeset recipientList to {}  tell application "Mail"     activate     repeat         set userResponse to display dialog "who would you like to send the email to?" default answer "type address here" buttons {"Cancel", "Add another", "Done"}         if button returned of userResponse is "Done" then exit repeat         set the end of recipientList to my findContact(text returned of userResponse)     end repeat     set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:"", content:"" &amp; return &amp; return}     tell newMessage         set visible to true         repeat with i from 1 to length of recipientList             make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:name of item i of recipientList, address:contactAddress of item i of recipientList}         end repeat     end tell end tell  on findContact(userResponse)     set contactChoiceNames to {}     set pIDs to {}      tell application "Contacts"         set possibleContacts to every person whose name contains userResponse         repeat with l from 1 to length of possibleContacts             set the end of contactChoiceNames to name of item l of possibleContacts             set the end of pIDs to id of item l of possibleContacts         end repeat     end tell      activate --clarify which user you mean     set contactChoice to item 1 of (choose from list (contactChoiceNames))      tell application "Contacts"         repeat with nameIndex from 1 to length of contactChoiceNames             if contactChoice is item nameIndex of contactChoiceNames then                 set contactData to item nameIndex of possibleContacts                 exit repeat             end if         end repeat         set thisContactData to {name:name of contactData, contactAddress:(value of email of contactData)}     end tell      if length of contactAddress of thisContactData &gt; 1 then --clarify which address you want to use         set addressChoice to item 1 of (choose from list (contactAddress of thisContactData))     else         set addressChoice to item 1 of contactAddress of thisContactData     end if     set contactAddress of thisContactData to addressChoice     return thisContactData end findContact /code/pre  <comment106841> Isn't this close to what creating a mail in Mail.app and typing the names into the To line does already?
