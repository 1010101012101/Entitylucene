How do I get my Google contacts in Gmail on my Gmail app on the iPad? <body> I don't have a Mac or Exchange (which seem to be two ways of doing this.)  When I open the iPad Gmail app (from Google) there are no Contacts and the email "to" field doesn't autocomplete. I effectively can't email unless I've memorized the email address.  I don't want to sync 1000 contacts. I just want to see a contacts link like I do when I use gmail on a computer. It couldn't get much simpler than that.   <answer41654> Here is how to export your Gmail contacts to your iPad Contacts list, so they will autofill when using the Mail app.  ol liNavigate to your contacts page and choose "Exportâ€¦" under the More menu./li liChoose All Contacts, and use the vCard format./li liOpen the downloaded file./li liWhen Address Book asks if you're sure you want to import them, choose yes, and quit Address Book when it's done./li liSelect your iPad in iTunes and navigate to the Info tab./li liTurn on Sync Address Book Contacts if it isn't already, and customize the settings how you like./li liSync your iPad with iTunes./li /ol  Done! I did notice from your question, though, that you're using the Gmail app. This fix will only work if you use Mail.app; for more information regarding setting that up, see this Apple help article.  Also: if you're running Windows, replace steps 3 and 4 with the instructions on this page.  <answer53624> You don't need to have Exchange.      You have to add an Exchange Account in the Mail-Settings with your GoogleAddress and password.   ol liAdd an Exchange Account/li liUsername is   strongusernamen@googlemail.com/strong, password is strongpassword/strong, Server is: strongm.google.com/strong and Domain is empty/li liNow you can sync your Contacts and Addresses to the iPad, too./li /ol     Your GMail App takes the contacts from the address book, and the   address book gets its contacts now from Google.   <answer60818> I don't know why everyone seems to over complicate this, you don't need to export contacts and import them somewhere else nor do you need exchange. Steps to sync contacts with your iDevice are as follows:  ol liPlug your device into your computer and open iTunes/li liSelect your device in iTunes and click the "info" tab/li liCheck "Sync Contacts" and then "Sync Google contacts"/li liEnter your google login info/li /ol  Done! Contacts will sync with gmail.  <answer76761> I had the same problem and didn't want to sync the contacts since its a shared ipad.  If you just need an occasional contact, you can access your contacts directly via this link: https://www.google.com/contacts/#contacts  <comment47211> What about the Mail app on the iPad. Why not use it to access your gmail account. I'm doing it that way and I've had no issue with autocomplete not knowing addresses. <comment47367> What is Address Book? is that something in Itunes on the PC or something on the iPad? <comment47483> It's an application for OS X. Like Contacts on iPad, but for Macs. <comment47494> So this solution wouldn't work if I don't hvae a Mac, right? <comment47498> It will; I've added a link to the end for Windows users: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Import-export-or-change-the-format-for-contacts <comment47704> So you import the addresses into Windows contacts and then sync THAT with the iPad? <comment47716> @ClayNichols Yep! <comment89354> It simplify my life I'd like the iPad to keep up to date with changes to my contacts. Also, I don't use iTunes, so this is a bit more complicated a solution that I'd like.
