How to import my data from Android into my new iPhone? <body> I recently changed my phone (it was an Android smartphone) to a new iPhone 7. I want to export and import a lot of files from my Android device to my iPhone but I do not know how to proceed. I have already tried it manually but it is a long and tiring job. What is a faster method?   <answer284591> You can use Apple's official strongMove to iOS/strong app, available on Google Play. This automatically moves the content you select from your Android phone to your iPhone. Install the app on your Android device and follow the instructions.

Is it  a faster method ?  Can you explain me how it works ? Thank you. <comment358877> See [this post](http://www.imore.com/how-move-your-photos-contacts-and-more-android-iphone) and see if it helps.
