How can I stop my MacBook Pro from automatically sleeping when I lock the screen? <body> Whenever I lock my screen (via either the lock icon - Lock screen or by using the Control+shift+eject key combination), my screen immediately turns off (not showing the screen saver), and the system seems to sleep.  This is inconvenient because it disconnects me from the network, causing Jabber to go offline / ssh connections to die.  I am constantly connected to AC, and am using the following Energy Saver-Power Adapter options:  ul liTurn display off after: Never/li liPrevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off/li liWake for Wi-Fi access/li /ul  I have a 'late 2013' MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9.1.  Is there any way to stop this from happening?  <answer120647> You can use InsomniaX for that.  With that, you can prevent your mac from sleeping, wether it's idle sleep or even when you close the lid.  <answer120648> Use either caffeinate or something like wimoweh  <answer120878> I found a solution that works for my needs: As it turns out, I should not lock the screen, but instead start the screensaver, and require the screensaver to immediately require a password.  I created a 'Start Screensaver' service with Automator, and then selected a keyboard shortcut for that service under Settings-Keyboard-Shortcuts-Services.  <answer129159> The answer is in your post. strongJust uncheck "Wake for Wifi Access" in the System Preferences under Energy Saver, Power Adapter./strong   When it's checked, it means that your computer disconnects from the network when you're computer's not awake.   <answer144799> Had the same problem in my Macbook(15") pro running strong10.9.4/strong.  I wanted my Mac to be locked while I was away (so configured hot corners) but at the same time did not want it to sleep (irrespective of whether it is connected to power or not) so that my wifi will be "ON" always for my jabber &amp; mails. So here's what I did to prevent Mac from sleeping:  ol liOpen strongTerminal/strong/li liRun codesudo pmset -a sleep 0/code/li /ol  Explanation of the command:  ul licodepmset/code command is to manipulate power management settings. /li licode-a/code specifies that the setting applies for all conditions (power &amp; battery)/li licodesleep/code configure system sleep timer/li licode0/code to disable/li /ul  Check out codeman pmset/code for more information.  <answer161446> I have a Mac Book Pro running 10.9.5.  To keep it from sleeping when I locked the screen, I changed the Energy Saver settings for Power Adapter, I checked "Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off" and I unchecked "Wake for network access".  <answer161468> Install SmartSleep(from Apple Store) with Insomnia plugin and your problem should be solved. You can even play music with your lid closed with no problems.  <answer270636> I went to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongEnergy Saver/strong and unchecked strongEnabled Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter/strong.  <comment140665> Please summarize as the link might die in the future. <comment140668> So I need a third party app that prevents the mac from sleeping? I can't just disable 'sleep on lock' somehow? <comment140681> caffeinate is part of the system but it's a command line tool. I don't think there's a preference that will disable sleep completely. I will personally leave my macbook go to sleep and use [mosh](http://mosh.mit.edu/) to circumvent the ssh disconnection problem. <comment281142> +1 the only one with decent settings for everything and it works on El Capitan.
