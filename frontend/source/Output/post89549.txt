Is there any way to speed up kdiff3 startup time? <body> I recently switched over to OS X from Kubuntu and am trying to get my favourite development tools working.  In Kubuntu I always used kdiff3 as my git difftool. I can get it to work on OS X, either by installing it via Mac Ports or downloading the binary from Sourceforge, but the startup time is horrible.  When I type git difftool and then press enter at the prompt, it takes 5 seconds until kdiff3 actually shows the file. Is there any way to speed this up? In Linux it was pretty much instantaneous.  (I assume it might be because OS X has to load all the KDE libs or similar, in which case it would be interesting to keep them preloaded somehow.)
