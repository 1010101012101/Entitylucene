Have one table be a filtered view of another in iWork Numbers <body> In Numbers (iWork), I have a table, and I want to construct multiple simultaneous filtered views of the table which update when I update the main table. For example, let's imagine I have a list of products - I want to have another table which is the list of e.g. just the products below a certain price, and yet another table which is the list of just the products with a certain word in their name. I know I can use filters to get these table subsets, but I don't want the filter to apply to the original table - instead I want to have other tables in the same file which are the filtered view of the data.  One naive solution is to create the tables and then set each cell to be equal to a cell in the original table (via an code=/code formula), then apply filters on these new tables. However, this is not ideal because if I add new rows to the original table, I need to add new rows to the other tables and once again set those cells to be equal to the ones in the original table.  Is there a better way to do this?
