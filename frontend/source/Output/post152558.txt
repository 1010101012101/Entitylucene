Can I use an iPad Air (iPad 5) screen protector on my iPad Air 2 (iPad 6) <body> I received an iPad Air 2 recently and am trying to order a screen protector for it. Can I use an iPad Air 1st Generation screen protecter? Are the width and height the same on both generations?  <answer152576> Yes, they are the same width and height. You can check the measurements on Apple's website. They're the same aside from the depth which has nothing to do with the screen protector.  precode          iPad Air 2              iPad Air Height    9.4 inches (240 mm)     9.4 inches (240 mm) Width     6.6 inches (169.5 mm)   6.6 inches (169.5 mm) Depth     0.24 inch (6.1 mm)      0.29 inch (7.5 mm) /code/pre  <comment179564> Welcome to Ask Different.
