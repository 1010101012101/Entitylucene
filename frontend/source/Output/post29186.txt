How to resolve error: "Couldn't modify partition map because file system verification failed"? <body> I upgraded to Lion and decided I no longer want 100 GB of my drive devoted to Boot Camp, I never boot into Windows, I just use it as a VM anyways. So I deleted the boot camp partition using disk utility and then attempted to expand the main partition to fill this now unallocated space. I also deleted the boot camp from inside VMWare Fusion. When I go to expand it, I get the error in the title of this question.  After searching this forum and Google, I found a lot of people with similar problems but none receiving this exact error with any resolution. I do not want to do a clean install if at all possible. I have enabled debug mode in Disk Utility and tried other stuff, but to no avail.   I've tried editing it in normal and in debug mode while running Lion, and I've tried in recovery mode.  Here are screenshots of the error and whatnot. Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ygfb.png" alt="Error message received"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LIkEm.png" alt="diskutil list output"  UPDATE: I verified my disk and got these errors. Attempting to repair but worried that my Snow Leopard disk will overwrite the Lion recovery partition....  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nUdsC.png" alt="Drive errors"  <answer29239> OK, this isn't too bad. Reboot while holding kbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdS/kbd to enter single user mode. When it gives you a prompt, type  precodefsck -fy /code/pre  then press return. it will repair your disk. When it's done, type   precodereboot /code/pre  and try partitioning again.  <answer29325> The solution ended up being to create a Lion install disk, boot from the disk, run disk utility repair on the drive and volume, then resize the partition. Easier than I thought it would be.  <answer62671> This solution worked for me after receiving the same error:  ul liShut down./li liStart up holding down kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdS/kbd. (This will boot you into Single User Mode.)/li liAt the prompt, type in the command codefsck -fy/code./li liWhen that finishes, type codereboot/code./li liTry resizing again in Disk Utility./li /ul  <answer233418> I had this issue and couldn't resolve it this way because I had a 4gb swap drive (ubuntu linux) that needed to be turned off before disk utility could remove it.  Steps:  ul liboot to to Ubuntu Live CD (I used an EFI boot via usb)/li liopen gparted via terminal code$ sudo gparted/code/li lilook for a partition with a key symbol on it's same line/li liright click the key symbol and select "swap off"/li lireboot back to mac then follow steps above/li /ul  Cheers  <comment50397> Does this cause any files to be deleted or any data to be lost? <comment50445> No, it's the equivalent of clicking the Repair Disk button in Disk Utility. <comment76054> I know this is a bit old, but this worked for me as well. I had to make the partition smaller, then resize it larger again for it to work. And yes it was easier than I thought it would be, too. After I found this post. <comment105818> This worked like a charm, thanks! <comment112958> Wohoo! This worked :) Thanks <comment127223> This worked on Mavericks for me! <comment133728> Great, this worked. Thanks! <comment142083> Just out of curiosity... What makes this work while repair disk (even from the recovery partition) couldn't. <comment175148> This worked for me for an external drive, so it's not that files were in use by the OS, as it could be for the main drive. <comment208643> thanks for the help. After I fix it, i'm told it's fixed, but then the same error occurred :(
