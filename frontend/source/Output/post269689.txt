Mac bash doesn't remember alias <body> I'm trying to create a simpler alias to launch MIT-scheme from the Terminal so I did:  precodealias mit-scheme="/Applications/MIT-Scheme.app/Contents/Resources/mit-scheme" /code/pre  Then I can launch MIT-scheme by simply typing codemit-scheme/code.  However if I close this Terminal window and open a new one, when I type codemit-scheme/code I get code-bash: mit-scheme: command not found/code.  What am I doing wrong?  <answer269692> Running the command will define it for the current shell, but that's it. There's nothing specific about macOS here â€” this is a bash thing. You have to run the command on every shell. To do this automatically, add the line to a sourced file such as code~/.bash_profile/code.
