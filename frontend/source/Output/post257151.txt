How to remove duplicates of a song on Apple music Samsung Galaxy S7 <body> One of the biggest reasons i switched from Spotify to Apple Music was so I could consolidate all of my music into one place. I download a lot of stuff from cites like Datpiff, and also occasionally buy CDs of music that apple music doesn't offer and just simply rip it on to iTunes.  Now, I have encountered a problem I don't know how to fix. I have uploaded an album I downloaded on datpiff to iTunes, and tried to edit the album info so that the compilation check and year were correct.   Wouldn't you know I ended up selecting all, so instead of manually going through and editing each song, I just deleted all of them after the iCloud music synced. 3 of the albums were available on iTunes, so I just re-added them to my apple music list, but when I uploaded the one from datpiff again, it shows the album has 2 copies of each song, only one of which is listenable and deletable. It only shows 1 copy of each on my laptop, and now every time I delete and re-add an extra copy keeps getting added, I'm up to 3 copies of each song of an album that was originally 22 songs tpo start with.  How do I delete the duplicates?  <comment320988> Note that the dups only show up on the android version of the apple music app, not the itunes on my computer
