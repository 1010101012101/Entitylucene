Why am I sending empty download photo requests? <body> A contact is receiving download photo notifications I'm not actually sending that are empty after they are clicked. Whats causing this? Is my phone spamming some body?  <comment205403> What kind of phone is your friend using? Are they receiving these notifications from a particular app? <comment205404> The messages are coming from an Iphone 6 to an android in the normal message income. They look the same as a normal photo download but, are empty.
