Running two separate instances of Safari in the same user session <body> I would like to run two strongseparate/strong Safaris at the same time. Each Safari having his own session, history, cookies, and so on.  I can do that with two users on my Mac.  But doing that in the same user session would be handier.  How can I do that ?  <answer133023> Safari does not support multiple profiles, so you will have to keep using multiple user account.   If all you want is a separate browsing environment with different accounts (cookies) used, you can try using strongPrivate Browsing/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZ8vu.png" alt="Private Browsing"  <answer133028> It seems like you'll be able to do this in Safari on Yosemite. Chrome is able to do this by just opening a new "In Cognito" window.  <answer133036> You can also type in the Terminal.app  precodeopen -n -a Safari /code/pre  This will open an new instance of Safari even if one is already running. Not every application supports this, like Finder or FireFox. Those applications prefers to have one instance running at a time.   <answer155607> Chrome has this built in and is well implemented. Firefox has a 3rd party plugin that manages this but it isn't as natively supported as it is in Chrome. Safari, no.  <answer198532> There is an app called SwitchUp that does this, however I think it doesn't play well with Safari extensions. Try and see for yourself.  <answer264163> The Fluid app, like mentioned in the comments, kind of allows this. It is more of a "single page app" tool, but it does use Safari under the hood and I use it to stay signed into different accounts at the same time without having to resort to Chrome[1].  In macOS Sierra the free version of Fluid allows separate cookies storage, while previously it was a (cheap) paid for feature.  [1] Chrome is great but uses too much battery for all day use.  <comment157539> Have an old version of Safari and a new version at the same time? It worked (not sure about the cookies) with Firefox for me <comment157543> @Mathias — No, I want to run two instances of the same version of Safari. I can do that for Firefox. <comment157579> how do cookies work when you do this? Are they separate? <comment157580> this would be better than user switching (assuming you weren't looking for remembered login cookies), but it still isn't side-by-side <comment157588> This won't answer with your exact question, but I use the $5 Fluid.app http://fluidapp.com to deal with situations (e.g. gmail) where I want to keep multiple separate logins to sites without any user switching acrobatics. <comment157599> If you're in private mode every instance of Safari will use their own cookies. "Public" mode, obviously, will share the cookies through all instances of Safari. <comment157660> @dwightk — This Fluid is interesting. Kind of reinventing the cutting of Dashboard widgets. <comment157663> Indeed, not every application is happy with this. For Safari, havoc would come. The navigation sessions (windows and tabs…) would enter in mid-air collision. I need the two Safaris to use different folders. <comment157674> Mid air collision about windows and tabs is not possible. Since Snow Leopard processes don't write their preferences directly to the file but is managed by the defaults system. So all this data is written and read through an API which avoids that two processes trying to write data at the same time to the same file. However if you want to have two separate folders which you can manage I would suggest to use fast user switching. Then you have two running processes of safari in also two different user environments. <comment157683> The free version doesn't keep separate cookies, but I gladly paid $5 to be able to keep google(et al) out of my browsing habits. <comment157723> OK. Now Safari A writes a session A to the file. And 30 seconds later Safari B writes a session B to the file, squashing session A. That’s what I call mid-air collision. <comment157727> I think you meant cookies when you say sessions? When both running in private mode the ~/Libary/Cookies/Cookies.plist file is not being used. No read or write actions are made to the file, there isn't an alternative file either. <comment168301> No, Chrome supports proper profiles, with separate password stores, history, etc.  Incognito is for sessions where you don't want anything saved. <comment237606> It will switch profiles etc but all at once you can't have 2 of the same running at the same time <comment331014> The free version of Fluid for macOS Sierra uses separate cookies.
