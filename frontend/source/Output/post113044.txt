To stop a process in Matlab with Dvorak keyboard <body> The keybing strongCMD-C/strong and strongCMD-point/strong work in Qwerty keybinding in OSX's Matlab, but not with Dvorak keybinding in OSX's Matlab. There must be a bug in Matlab, which is causing this.  The problem is that when I push press play button for an algorithm in while loop.  Many times, I want to stop it before the while-loop end.   The code below is not a low-level code since it can be stopped with Qwerty keyboard layout.     strongHow can you stop process in OSX Matlab with Dvorak keyboard layout?/strong   strongExample of the function that I am trying to stop/strong  precodewhile 1;      3 end /code/pre  <answer113045> strongMatlab's hardcoded CTRL-C combo/strong  It is not CMD-C, it is CTRL-C VISUALLY. So press CTRL-C as written on your keyboard, not the C on Dvorak layout or any other layout. Matlab has hardcoded the interruption command to a key, not a letter.  strongDebugging/strong  The way I do it is to create breakpoint with the looping vars  precodefor ii=1...10000      if isequal(ii,2000)            %Add here a breakpoint      end      ... end /code/pre  where the breakpoints make it possible to stop the execution. Also force-quiting Matlab is the other way. I know no other way to them.  <answer113051> It is codeCTRL-C/code, but codeCommand-period/code works as well. If you have tried this  and it's not working you are probably trying to interrupt a function  that isn't interruptible. You can't interrupt a low-level function  call, such as a big matrix multiply or backslash or something like that.  <comment132691> These commands work if you are using Qwery keyboard layout, but not with Dvorak keyboard layout that I am using. I tried also to press the Qwerty position of the keys unsuccessfully. So Matlab is messing something with different keyboard layouts. <comment133679> See my updated answer, CTRL-C visually and C is hardcoded to a specific key not changed when layout changed. <comment133680> +1 for pointing out that CTRL-C, not CMD-C. <comment133681> This works! CTRL-C visually.
