How can I open port 8080 of Mac OS X Lion? <body> How can I open access to port 8080 from the outside world (private lan) on my Mac OS X Lion? I'd like to access a webpage that's running on my lamp stack on my mac (zend server ce) from within the lan. I can access port 80 just fine.  Port 8080 is blocked on the other hand.  I've also disabled the firewall.  <answer31377> If the firewall is off and you're sure Apache is listening on :8080, then you must have a firewall upstream somewhere that's blocking 8080. Unblock it there.   <answer32049> When you say that you disabled the firewall, do you mean the one in: codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security &gt; Firewall/code, or the codeipfw/codeIP Firewall that you can access from the command line? Or perhaps both?  To check to see if you have codeipfw/code rules, you can always go to the terminal and type in:  codesudo ipfw list/code  You might also use codenmap/code to check if the port is open from different places on your internal network. Of course, OS X doesn't comes with nmap by default, so you would have to try that from a Linux machine or use something like Fink or Macports to install it.  codenmap -p 8080 host.domain.com/code  I hope this helps.  <answer74155> You can disable firewall or you can allow a certain application to accept incoming connections. Plus to allow access to the outside world (e.g www), you'll need to forward traffic to your internal gateway:port via your router settings.  Here's how to do this:  ol liMac-Sys Preferences-Sharing-Enable “Web Sharing” checkbox/li liMac-Sys Preferences-Security- Turn off firewall, or allow your application to accept incoming connection/li liOpen a port on the router (via 192.168.1.1) to forward traffic from your_web_ip:port to a local_gateway:port  ol liRouter Settings - Port Forwarding - create rule: forward to local gateway (e.g. 192.168.1.4), custom port, protocol tcp, source=any, destination=3280, all connection types, forward to port = 8080./li /ol/li /ol  Done. Now from the remote computer, open your browser to your web ip address (find via http://www.whatismyip.com/) + destination port# above, e.g. 72.189.194.65:3280, this will connect to your local 192.168.1.4:8080  <comment35957> Where are you wanting to accomplish this?  At work or home? <comment35958> In any arbitrary lan. <comment35959> Is Apache configured to listen on Port 8080 yet? <comment98886> I'm missing the third point: How to access to router settings? I don't find any option on preferences. <comment99124> You can get access to your router usually by http://192.168.1.1 with admin name and password. <comment103354> This doesn't answer the question - how to open a port. It only suggests ways to check if the port is open. <comment183366> Basically when you say 'open a port' its a several step process.  1) Configure & Start your application (ie Apache).  2)  Verify the application is listening on the port:  from commandline netstat -a | grep 8080  3) Turn off firewall(s).  Bottom line is an application needs to be listening on that port for the whole process to work.
