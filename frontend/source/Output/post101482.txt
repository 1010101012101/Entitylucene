OS X Terminal: "backward delete word" works only with C-M-h <body> Followup on Mac OS X Terminal: Map option+delete to “backward delete word”.  The codeUse option key as meta key/code option is checked, but the deleting word backwards works emonly/em with kbd^/kbd-kbd⌥/kbd-kbdH/kbd (i.e. one has to emalso/em hold the kbd^/kbd or codeControl/code key)! strongHow can you backward delete a word with kbd⌥/kbd-kbdH/kbd only?/strong This annoyance happens emonly/em in codeTerminal.app/code ... and interestingly also in codeiTerm.app/code!  I also have this in code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code, so that I can enjoy Emacs throughout:  precode{"~h" = "deleteWordBackward:";} /code/pre  hr  Environment: OS X 10.8.2 (12C54), Terminal 2.3 (309), iTerm  <answer101609> Settings in DefaultKeyBinding.dict don't apply to the shell views in Terminal or iTerm 2.  You can make codeM-h/code delete a word backward by adding this to code~/.inputrc/code  precode"\eh": backward-kill-word /code/pre  codeM-h/code is bound to codemark-paragraph/code by default in Emacs though.  If others search for how to make ⌥⌫ delete a word backward, just enable using option as a meta key:  ul liIn Terminal, check Settings  (your profile)  Keyboard  Use option as meta key/li liIn iTerm 2, set the option keys to act as "+ Esc" in Profiles  (your profile)  Keys/li /ul  If others search for how to make ⌥⌦ delete a word forward, you can make it insert code\ed/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jT500.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wd5rY.png" alt=""  ⌥⌦ inserts code\e(/code by default in Terminal and code\e[3~/code in iTerm 2, so you could also add code"\e(": kill-word/code or code"\e[3~": kill-word/code to code~/.inputrc/code.  <answer292746> Almost all terminal use emacs hotkeys to manipulate text (see readline keyboard shortcuts), and in emacs, you use codebackward-kill-word/code (meta-delete) to delete the previous word.  And, in emacs, codemeta-&lt;KEY&gt;/code (key composition) equals to codeescape &lt;KEY&gt;/code (key chord), so in this case, you can use kbdESCAPE/kbd kbdDEL/kbd to delete the previous word.  <comment119556> On OS X 10.8.4, when I type Option-H with “Option is Meta” enabled, it sends “ESC h”. What program are you interacting with? Are you sure it maps “ESC h” to “backward delete word”? In many programs, you can verify what’s being sent to the tty by prefixing with either Control-V or Control-Q to quote the “ESC h” input. <comment119565> For questions like this, it helps to include the OS version you’re working with. <comment119566> @Chris Nice tip on using Control-V for inspection. Pressing "Option-H" sends "^[h" (either Option_L or Option_R). <comment119568> Do you want to use Option + H or would Option + Delete be fine for the same purpose? <comment119570> @MK Option + H, of course. Must stay on the home row. :)
