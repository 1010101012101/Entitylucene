Hidden character Shift-Arrow Up-Backspace <body> Sometimes when I want to delete a line of text very quickly I do this:  I hold the shift key and press the arrow up key to select the line above and then I press backspace. But occasionally I press all three keys at the same time which deletes the line too but creates a hidden control character with the value 08: the value for the backspace control character.  This can be pretty annoying e.g. if you are writing code and you can't figure out what causes the parse error.  Am I the only one who struggles with this from time to time? Is it possible to change this behavior?  <answer61560> I can't reproduce this either. However, I suggest that you hold down kbdCommand/kbd and then press kbdDelete/kbd, as an alternative to your method. This will delete everything on the line that's left of the cursor, and will hopefully solve your problem. (You can hold down kbdOption/kbd to delete single words. Experiment with holding down the kbdOption/kbd or kbdCommand/kbd key, and pressing either kbdDelete/kbd or the arrow keys. If you hold down kbdShift/kbd with either kbdOption/kbd or kbdCommand/kbd and then press the arrow keys, you will be able to select text word by word, or line by line.)  <comment25350> I can't seem to reproduce this. I'm using a MacBook Pro (built-in keyboard) on Lion. Obviously I'm testing it in Chrome, and I tried in MacVim too.  (1) What is your hardware setup? (2) Which app(s?) can you do this in? <comment25351> Can't reproduce either <comment25352> It doesn't seem to work in Chrome. I guess they disabled control characters. Try it in the search field in Safari. The X icon will appear, which proofs that there is invisible text. <comment25363> Is "backspace" what my keyboard calls "delete"? <comment25396> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backspace <comment25425> What editor(s) can you get this to happen in? Perhaps its a feature that could be disabled. <comment25427> Just try it in Safari as I wrote above. Its a bug or feature in Mac OS I guess since 10.0.
