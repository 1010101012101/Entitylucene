iPhone 5 stuck while synchronising <body> I was just setting up a new-to-me second-hand iPhone 5. I'd added my email account, checked it was sending texts, and connected it to my computer to synchronise to iTunes.  The phone has become frozen on ascreen that shows plugin-arrow-iTunes logo.  Part-way through the process my computer told me to update iTunes. It wouldn't update. I tried it twice and then tried "Restore" - that also failed, with this message:  "An unknown error occurred (14)."  Switching the phone off and on has no effect. Ditto holding down both top and bottom buttons.  I've tried different USB ports - no change. At least one of them works, as my wireless mouse is plaugged in. Interestingly however, I noticed that while the iPhone was plugged in, my mouse would conk out (with a "device unplugged" sound DOOMP-doomp, then a few minutes later it would start working again, with a "device plugged in" sound ddomp-DOOMP.  If anyone can advise me please, I'd be extremely grateful! Thanks in anticipation.
