Contacts, iCloud and way too many images <body> I use iCloud and contacts since ages and noticed that  precodeLibrary/Application Support/AddressBook/Sources/E6B38FB0-A804-431A-9BEE-DB2F0297CA55/Images /code/pre  contains more than 600'000 items (for example many copies of the same image used for the contacts).  I see this behaviour only on one of my machines.  How can I get rid of these many duplicated without losing my data?  Can I simply disable iCloud and contacts, delete the folder and re-enable it?  <comment315368> I've just deleted the folder, and restarted. <comment315474> @IronCraftMan Thanks seems to work
