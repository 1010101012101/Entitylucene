My 2011 Macbook Pro won't start - folder with blinking '?' <body> My Mac will not start up. I went to recovery mode and made a backup of everything on an external drive. Now the Mac only starts up from the external drive.  I have OS X 10.10, Yosemite. I tried to backup and restore but it failed.  Most of the time my internal hard disk is not mounted. I ran Disk Utility today and got the following message for my HD strongError: Partition Map check failed because no slices were found/strong  How can I fix my Mac and make it start without the external drive?   <answer193436> Looks like a disk problem, dying. In the Recovery Partition (start while holding CMD+R), start DiskUtility do Repair Disk. Even when the issue is gone after that, prepare to have the disk replaced.  <comment230067> so the holding "cmd+r" during boot  is not working ? <comment230069> it does work. Thats how I transferred all my data to my external hard disk. <comment230070> Did you try formatting the internal disk? <comment230071> Is that by erasing it? I tried that but it hangs halfway. <comment230072> and when I go into recovery mode, it does not connect to my wifi. However it connects to it when I boot up from my external drive. <comment230073> When I try to erase my interal drive. I get a error message of: Volume Erase Failed not enough space on drive <comment230074> Partitioned my main internal hard drive that was names "Apple HDD 500.11 GB" However that is stuck on the phase "Waiting for disks to reappear" <comment230133> That would say your disk can not be repaired.
