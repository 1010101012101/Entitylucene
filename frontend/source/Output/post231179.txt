Two formulas in the same cell in Apple's Numbers <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fd2dt.png" alt="enter image description here"  In Apple's Numbers, I have a table which calculates GAP between two values in two rows (red), I would like even to calculate gap between calculated values in the same cell (blue), is it possible?  <comment282283> âˆ‚(98-60 )=-38! Or what's the meaning of -28? <comment282284> oops... I made a mistake!
