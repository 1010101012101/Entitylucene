What is the software to move screen/laptop to apple TV screen <body> I have seen users that drag their screen to AppleTV on WiFi for presentations and such. I want to be able to do this but can't find the software. I ask and they say it is built in.  I have MacBook Pro with OS X 10.7.5 I have the most recent updates. Is this software available?  <answer94881> This is called AirPlay Mirroring. How to use it on a second generation Apple TV or higher can be found on Apple's site here and here  <comment111305> And the OP will need OS X 10.8 or later on his Mac. The older 10.7.x he has won't support AirPlay Mirroring. <comment111306> You'll need to upgrade your OS X. See below. <comment111346> OK, I had to upgrade to 10.8 and I now have access to AppleTV/Play mirroring.
