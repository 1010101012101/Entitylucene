Syncing folders on different machines using Google Drive <body> I symlink the Documents folder on two different folders to my Dropbox folder, which keeps them nice and synced between the two machines. I'd like to switch to Google Drive for various reasons. I found an article (Symlink Google Drive) that gives good instructions on how to sync folders to Google Drive using hard links, and this is working well. My Documents folder has been uploaded to my GDrive, and syncing is working between changes I make in Google and on my machine. Now my question is: how do I sync the Documents folder on my other machine? I add Google Drive, and just repeat the instructions to sync the Documents folder? My worry is that because the Documents folder will already exist inside the Google Drive directory this time, it won't produce the desired effect. (Haven't tried, for fear of messing something up.) Thanks!
