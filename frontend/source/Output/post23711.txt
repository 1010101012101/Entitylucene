How do I make a certain keyboard command system wide? <body> I'm using WireTap to record some documentary while I need to frequently make cue mark command (Command-Shift-T).   And the way I do is first use Command-Tab to switch to Wire Tap and hit Command-Shift-T, and then switch back to the player which is very annoying.  Is there a way to make the command system wide?  <answer23749> I think you are looking for Spark. It's a great (free!!) hot key manager for OS X. I have found it to be very useful. I don't exactly understand what you want to make system wide, but if you'll edit your question to clarify what you mean, I can give you more help with setting up the hot keys.  <answer23755> strongKeyboard Maestro/strong is a very powerful and easy to use keyboard macro app. If you want a multi-step process available everywhere on your Mac you can't do much better.  By "multi-step process" I mean, to use your example, no matter what app I'm using right now, pressing a certain key combination performs these steps.  ol liQuickly switch to the Wire Tap app./li liPress kbdCmd/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdT/kbd in the Wire Tap app./li liQuickly switch back to whatever app you were previously in./li /ol  This all happens so quickly that you can barely tell any app switching occurred.  I use it to start and stop my time tracking app at the press of a keystroke, for instance, as well as ensuring that kbdCmd/kbdkbd+/kbd zooms in no matter what graphics app I'm using and kbdCmd/kbdkbd-/kbd zooms out.
