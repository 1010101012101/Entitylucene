Handoff with different iPhones <body> Which iPhone will work with handoff in between macs and itself. I'm looking into buying one and I want to make sure I could use handoff.  <answer188315> The 'Handoff' functionality depends on your iOS version and device hardware, as well as your Mac hardware. As it states in in the Apple support page for 'Handoff':     Handoff works with several apps that come with OS X Yosemite and iOS 8: Calendar, Contacts, Mail, Maps, Messages, Notes, Phone (iOS only), Reminders, and Safari. It also works with Keynote v6.5, Numbers v3.5, and Pages v5.5 for Mac, and Keynote, Numbers, and Pages v2.5 for iOS. Third-party apps may also work with Handoff.   iOS hardware that is compatible with Handoff:  ul liiPhone 4S (sharing iPhone calls only)/li liiPhone 5 or later/li liiPod Touch (5th generation)/li liiPad 4th gen and iPad Air/Air 2/li liiPad mini, mini with Retina display and mini 3/li /ul  Further requirements for specific features are found on Apple's support page.  Mac hardware that is compatible with Handoff:  ul liMacBook Air (Mid 2012 and later)/li liMacBook Pro (Mid 2012 and later)/li liiMac (Late 2012 and later)/li liMac mini (Late 2012 and later)/li liMac Pro (Late 2013)/li /ul  <comment222984> Just because a device can run iOS 8 doesn't mean that all features of it are available. Handoff requires specific hardware in the phone, too. I edited your post with a corrected list of compatible devices. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204689 <comment222986> That is good to know.
