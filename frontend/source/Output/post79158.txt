How to tell if the iphone 5 is connected to the 2.4 or 5 ghz network? <body> I just got a new 5th generation apple airport extreme and I set it up in the dual band mode and I am wondering if it is possible to see which frequency the iphone 5 is connecting to. I know that on the computer you can hold down option when clicking on the wifi menu, but I would really like to know which one my iphone is connecting to.  <answer81408> See the answers to this similar question.  Since you are using an AirPort Extreme, you can set up a separate SSID for the 5GhZ-network and connect to that one manually on your phone, and from there be able to see which network you're on. To do this, follow the below step:     Airport Utility 6.0: Airport Extreme  Edit  Wireless  Wireless Options  Tick the box next to "5GHz network name".br   Airport Utility 5.6 and earlier: Manual Setup  Wireless  Wireless Network Options  Tick the box.   supSource/sup   P.S. Having a different SSID does not make it a separate network, it just makes the two bands differentiable.  <comment91682> Is there no possible way to do this?
