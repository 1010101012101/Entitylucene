terminal starts with `no such file or directory` message <body> I removed Enthought Canopy from my Mac and now when I start terminal there's this warning message says   precode-bash: /Users/myname/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/activate: No such file or directory -bash: /Users/myname/Library/Enthought/Canopy_32bit/User/bin/activate: No such file or directory /code/pre  of course they don't exist because I deleted the program. How do I remove the message?  <answer106101> You need to edit your profile (.profile, .bashrc, .zshrc, .tcshrc, etcâ€¦ that is appropriate for your chosen shell) and remove any lines that contain "Enthought". It might be a bit more complicated than just deleting a couple of lines depending on what it did to your login file.  <comment124695> Thank you!
