How to open Microsoft XPS document on OS X? <body> I got this XPS file from my teacher and I couldn't open it using my Mac. It should be a lecture presentation. Does anybody know how to open it?  thanks you  <answer222449> Upload the file to your Google Drive, then view the file in your browser.  You can also save it as a PDF from there.  Or download third-party software as suggested in the comments.  <comment269543> Wouldn't it be easier to just ask your teacher? <comment269547> @patrix thank you for your comment, he told me that this an xps  file, but i don't know how to open such file. <comment269550> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/213300/convert-xps-to-pdf <comment269555> Or https://duckduckgo.com/?q=open+XPS+on+mac&t=osx <comment269560> @patrix thank you again for your reply. but i can't even know which file is xps, as you could see this a zip and i didn't found any xps extension. i am not sure How this file is compound. <comment269562> I've never worked with XPS files but I would assume that the whole ZIP file is the XPS file. Let's see whether somebody has a answer. <comment269564> @patrix ok thanks .
