Terminal: Application Not Responding <body> A few days ago, Terminal.app suddenly stopped working. Whenever I open it, the little light below the icon in the dock turns on (and stays on), but no window appears. When I right-click the icon, I'm told that the application isn't responding.  strongWhat I've tried so far:/strong  ul liRestarting./li liTrying to open Terminal from another account (same result)./li liDeleting code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist/code./li liDeleting code~/.bash_*/code and code~/.zsh*/code./li liDeleting code/var/log/asl/*/code./li liBanging my head against the wall./li liUse iTerm. A black window opens, but after that I get "Application Not Responding" as well./li liRepairing permissions from Disk Utility./li /ul  The Console works fine, but all I get when I try to open a Terminal (or iTerm) instance is something like     codelogin: USER_PROCESS: 5991 ttys008/code   I'm running OS X 10.8.3.  hr  h2Update/h2  ul liIt would seem that Activity Monitor isn't working either. When I open it, the windows appears, but the list is empty and the program freezes: "Application Not Responding" here as well./li liI can log into the machine using SSH from another machine, but when I do codeps/code it freezes./li /ul  <answer88244> Firstly, I would check to see if the issue is systemic, or related to the user account. Create a new blank user account, and then see if you can remotely log into the computer using that ID.  Then, if that works, try to su to your existing ID.  Also, try a start in single user mode. See what works there. After that, try safe mode.  Interestingly, using Terminal I get the same message in the console as you, but I don't using iTerm. Perhaps you can try iTerm and see if that works. It would narrow the issue down to the specific applications.  <comment103272> As mentioned, I have already tried with blank user account. There I get the same result - "Application Not Responding". I will try single user mode now. I already tried iTerm, but that doesn't work either. <comment103273> OK, so after rebooting into single user mode (which worked), I booted back into OS X and suddenly everything is working again. Now I come to think about it, I hadn't rebooted since I tried some of the stuff listed above, so that might be what triggered it, or the fact that I just briefly went into single user mode. Either way, your suggestion lead me to a solution, so I'll take it. Thank you. :-) <comment103364> You're install of OSX sounds borked... very, very borked. Has your hard drive failed? <comment103366> The operating system it self is in fact on a SSD, but my user folder is on a HDD, but neither have failed. I think it might have had something to do with a half-finished OS X update, but that has all been sorted out now. <comment103415> Single-user mode runs some checks that are reported to fix mysterious issues. I've seen several posts about it, but not much official from Apple.
