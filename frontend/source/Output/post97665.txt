Logic Pro X: why does iPad (Logic Remote) stay stuck on "analyze"? <body> I'm running Logic Pro X, and I use Logic Remote as control surface (I just want to type in a bit of music nothing too fancy).   I've opened a project (movie setting) which seems rather light to me (no Logic Pro heavy user...) but Logic Remote stays stuck on "analyze". Any idea why/what it means(what is there to analyze by a control surface anyway?)/how to fix this?  <comment114730> What is the exact version of Logic Pro X that you are using, and what is the exact version of Logic Remote? Apple is releasing bug-fix updates; the current version is 10.0.1. Run Software Update and see if Apple has released any that you don't know about. <comment115460> Seems to have disappeared after an update @WheatWilliams I have another issue though that cropped up, the iPad connects once in a while only... I hope it's Logic's fault, and not the Airport Express or iPad...
