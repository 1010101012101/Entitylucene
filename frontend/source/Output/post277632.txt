I messed up my menu bar with Obsidians dark menu bar <body> I have an older mac running Mavericks and I installed the Obsidian black menu bar. I didn't like it and wanted to restore so I launched the Obsidian menu bar restore app.  After restoring, the problem is it restored the color of the bar to original but NOT the text of the battery life, the clock/date and my username is white. So its white text on a grey menu bar, you can barely read it. Can someone help with restoring my menu bar back to is original state? All I want is for all text in the menu bar to be black again.
