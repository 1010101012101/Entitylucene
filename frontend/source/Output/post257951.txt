How to set up ethernet connection with static IP through USB adapter on MacAir? <body> At work I used to connect to Ethernet with my MacAir using a static IP address and the standard emApple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter/em. I now got an extra monitor, and to connect it to my computer it turned out that I need to use the single Thunderbolt port on my MacAir. For that reason, I bought the emAnker's USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter/em, which works fine at home, where no static IP address is needed. However, at work it won't help, for I would need then to fix the static IP address for the Ethernet coming through the USB connection (and it does not seem obvious how to do it)...  Any solutions, anybody?!  PS: We don't have wifi at work, but I just thought that maybe I can (should?) set up a personal router using my Ethernet cable with my static IP address and solve the problem in some other way?
