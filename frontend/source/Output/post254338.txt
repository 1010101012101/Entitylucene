Why does the output of “last” in macOS 10.12 (Sierra) show seemingly nothing but “crash” entries? <body> I just upgraded my Mac mini (Late 2012) to macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and noticed something strange: When running the codelast/code command in the Terminal—which shows you a history of user logins, reboots and shutdowns—seemingly all of the entries are now indicating “crash” when I can assure you this system has never crashed since the upgrade.  Here is the output of codelast/code on my system:  precodemy_mac:~ jake$ last  jake      ttys001                   Sat Sep 24 09:05   still logged in jake      ttys000                   Sat Sep 24 09:05   still logged in jake      console                   Sat Sep 24 09:01   still logged in reboot    ~                         Sat Sep 24 09:00  jake      ttys000                   Sat Sep 24 09:00 - crash  (00:00) jake      ttys000                   Sat Sep 24 01:19 - crash  (07:41) jake      ttys000                   Sat Sep 24 00:13 - crash  (08:47) jake      ttys000                   Fri Sep 23 23:45 - crash  (09:15) jake      console                   Fri Sep 23 22:45 - crash  (10:15) reboot    ~                         Fri Sep 23 22:44  jake      ttys000                   Fri Sep 23 07:35 - crash  (15:08) jake      ttys000                   Fri Sep 23 07:31 - crash  (15:12) jake      console                   Fri Sep 23 07:00 - crash  (15:43) reboot    ~                         Fri Sep 23 06:59  jake      ttys000                   Thu Sep 22 22:56 - crash  (08:03) jake      ttys000                   Thu Sep 22 22:03 - crash  (08:56) jake      ttys000                   Thu Sep 22 21:21 - crash  (09:38) jake      ttys001                   Thu Sep 22 21:18 - crash  (09:41) jake      ttys000                   Thu Sep 22 21:16 - crash  (09:42) jake      ttys000                   Thu Sep 22 19:59 - crash  (10:59) jake      ttys000                   Thu Sep 22 19:23 - crash  (11:36) _mbsetupuser  console                   Thu Sep 22 08:35 - crash  (22:24) jake      console                   Thu Sep 22 08:26 - crash  (22:33) reboot    ~                         Thu Sep 22 08:21  /code/pre  Typically that output should reflect codereboot/code for a cold boot or even a warm reboot. That data can be gleaned now by running codelast reboot/code as shown here:  precodemy_mac:~ jack$ last reboot reboot    ~                         Sat Sep 24 09:00  reboot    ~                         Fri Sep 23 22:44  reboot    ~                         Fri Sep 23 06:59  reboot    ~                         Thu Sep 22 08:21  /code/pre  But it still seems odd/broken to me since I’m quote confident this behavior was not the case in Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or previous versions of Mac OS X since the main reason I use codelast/code like this is to casually keep track of the last times I shut down or restarted the system.  strongemNOTE:/strong Yes, that codelast/code man page I link to on the Apple website states that the entry is for Mac OS X 10.9 and is a “retired” document, the output of codeman last/code on my macOS 10.12 system is 100% the same./em  <comment317186> Having the user session terminated by `crash` might just be a bug <comment317314> @patrix Possibly. But the issue is not the supposed “crash” stuff as much as why reboots and shutdowns don’t seem to show up anywhere. The tool is old and solid, but works. Wonder if there is something fundamental in macOS Sierra that has mucked things up? <comment317392> The reboots show up, even in your `last` output above. It's "just" that the user sessions are terminated by "crash" instead of "shutdown" (or whatever was the reason before). If `last` hasn't changed it's probably macOS which writes the utmp records differently.
