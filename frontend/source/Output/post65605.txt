What is PPPMonitord.app? <body> I was looking to disable some startup daemons and apps on my Mountain Lion iMac, and I noticed that inside code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code there is a file called codecn.com.zte.PPPMonitor.plist/code which point to an application at code/Library/Application Support/ZTE/PPPMonitord.app/code.  Does anybody know what this is, or at least if it's something internal, or installed by third-party applications?  <answer65607> ZTE (Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation) is a manufacturer of USB mobile internet access devices.  PPPMonitord.app is a companion application that belongs to such "surf stick".  Often these devices are sold by mobile carriers such as Vodafone, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, etcetera.  <comment77150> Basing on the filename, I would say it is not an application developed by Apple, or the filename would start with com.apple. <comment77169> Ahhhh, ok... I had some long time ago something like this... Makes perfect sense. Removed it. Thank you!
