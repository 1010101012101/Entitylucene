How can I make my Terminal login as my mac account and now bootcamp partition? <body> I recently installed windows 7 on a partition using bootcamp and all went well. Now i am trying to use terminal on my original mac partition on OSX but the command line comes up as:  myusername-Win7:~ username$  i am having trouble connecting to an ssh tunnel for lowering for WoW, could this be my problem as it looks like its using windows 7?  <answer103588> Look's like somehow your computer has had it's name changed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/boxBX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Changing your Mac’s computer name:    ol liLaunch codeSystem Preferences/code  /li liClick the codeSharing/code icon  /li liType in what you want your Mac’s new computer name to be  /li liClose codeSystem Preferences/code/li /ol  <comment34603> If you run `id -un` you will get the username of the current logged in user for terminal. You can change who you are logged in with `login` command. <comment34622> It might also be that your hostname got changed. Can you run `hostname` at the shell prompt (and also have a look at the system name in Preferences)?
