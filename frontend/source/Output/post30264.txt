Upgraded iPad 2 to iOS 5 : no device summary pane <body> I upgraded my iPad 2 to iOS 5.  I don't want to sync it through the cloud : I just want to sync it as usual, with iTunes through my USB connector.  But I have a problem : as soon as I upgradedto iOS 5, when my iPad is connected to my Mac, iTunes is not displaying the emdevice summary pane/em.  I have SnowLeopard 10.6.8, iTunes 10.5.  Here is a screenshot of what I get :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lluXN.png" alt="My iPad, connected to my Mac"  As you can see, the iPad is seen by iTunes, but no device summary pane is displayed.  Any idea how I can solve this problem ?  <answer30771> Well I found a solution to my problem : I connected my iPad to another Mac, to check if I would face the same problem. It worked fine on the other machine.  Then, I tried to connect it again to my own Mac and to my great surprise, it was working perfectly !  So basically, connecting my iPad to another Mac solved the problem !  <comment34737> Did you reboot both your Mac and your iPad already? <comment34738> Yes, I did...but I still get the same problem. I also tried to restore my iPad. But that didn't change anything. <comment34739> Is your iTunes updated to the newest version? <comment34763> As mentioned in my question, I have iTunes 10.5, which, at the time of writing this question, the latest version.
