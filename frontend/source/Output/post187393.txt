Downgrade, can not reinstall <body> I completely erased my internal HD in order to downgrade OS.  Now, I boot from CD (to reinstall Snow Leopard) and I get the message "Mac OS X can not be installed in his computer". Any suggestions?  <comment221478> What version od Mac do you have - did the OS X CD come with the mac? <comment221480> It was running with 10,6,8. I upgraded to 10,8 and I need to go down. <comment221482> You need to answer the exact question - what version of OS X came with the Mac - and what version are you trying to install <comment221483> Initially with Leopard. <comment221484> Are you trying to reinstall with the **original CD/DVD** delivered with exactly the Mac you are downgrading? <comment221488> No, i tried with Snow Leopard directly. However, from your question in your previous post, I suspected the problem and I already started to install Leopard. It 's working ok so far. Did I do right?
