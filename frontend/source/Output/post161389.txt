How to merge 2 one page PDF files <body> On codeLion/code (from memory, and I can't check anymore) this method:  ul liopen a one page PDF codedoc2/code (with codePreview/code),/li liopen a one page PDF codedoc1/code (with codePreview/code),/li lidrag thumbnail from codedoc1/code onto codedoc2/code,/li lisave as (kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbd⇧/kbdkbdS/kbd) onto codedoc3/code/li /ul  was an easy way to make:  precodedoc3 = doc1 + doc2 /code/pre  or in Unix talk:  precodecat doc1 doc2 &gt;doc3 /code/pre  Apparently (fixes appreciated) since codeMountain Lion/code this simple receipe doesn't work anymore.  hr  What is the easy way to achieve such a basic operation for PDF files:  ul ligiven 2 PDF documents codedoc1/code and codedoc2/code,/li liI want to get codedoc3 = doc1 + doc2/code,/li liwith as simple an application as codePreview/code,/li liwithin a few seconds of click, click, click…./li /ul  I need this basic function for users running codeMountain Lion/code, codeMavericks/code, codeYosemite/code.  <answer161392> Open the two PDFs with Preview  Drag the thumbnails of the second PDF to the end of the first PDF but strongabove the grey line/strong (marked with the red arrow):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kw6pp.jpg" alt="pdf1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m2sVo.jpg" alt="pdf2"  and finally export the resulting PDF to a third PDF.  If your first PDF contains just one page this doesn't work.  Workaround 1: Open your second PDF, then open the first PDF, drag the single page to the beginning of the second PDF and export the resulting PDF to a third PDF.  Workaround 2: Insert an empty second page at the end of the first page.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmzOg.jpg" alt="blank"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qQQ2j.jpg" alt="blank2"  and drag the second PDF to the regular end of your first PDF  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBaUJ.jpg" alt="blank3"  delete the empty page at the end and export the remaining pages to a new third PDF.  <comment188569> This still works on Yosemite... <comment188574> and in Mavericks... <comment188680> I've also found that doing a Print to PDF then Save does work with single page PDF merging after you've dragged them into the new PDF
