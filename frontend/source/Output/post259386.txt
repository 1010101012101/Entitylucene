Upgrading Mavericks --> Sierra <body> I just tried to upgrade my OS from Mavericks to Sierra. The app store shows that I have installed Sierra (see pic), but "about this mac" and the command line both say I still have 10.9.5 (Mavericks).  Am I missing a step?  Or is this a bug and how do I solve it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S7K7z.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment324517> You Downloaded it.  You didn't install it.  To install it, you need to to you Applications folder and launch it. <comment324523> Can you be more specific?  What is the name of the thing I need to launch? It does *say* installed (look at the pic).  What does that mean? <comment324525> It says that a security update was installed. That Sierra banner is just an ad. The name of the app is "Install macOS Sierra.app" or something along those lines
