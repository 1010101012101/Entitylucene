Remove app names in OS X Yosemite Dock <body> How can I disable/hide the App Name in the OS X Yosemite Dock?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hExWD.png" alt=""  <answer164810> You have to edit the file code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist/code.  You need to replace every label like code"file-label" =&gt; "AppName"/code with code"file-label" =&gt; ""/code.  Restart the Dock or logout and back again to activate the changes.  <comment193257> This only works for applications you actually drag into the Dock, not for applications which only show up in the Dock while running. <comment193262> In that file i only see:  ?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"? !DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd" plist version="1.0" dict  keyDesktopAdminImageGenerationNumber/key  dict   keyGenerationNumber/key   string2/string  /dict /dict /plist <comment193264> How did you open the file? <comment193267> I used textWrangler app <comment193276> Could you test if `plutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist` shows you other result that TextWrangler?
