Apple Configurator 2 App Downloads <body> When applying a blueprint to a device we want to build Configurator 2 downloads the apps, is there a way of stopping it downloading the latest version of the apps and installing the version already downloaded?  As we only build 2/3 devices at a time it's just time consuming as we have a poor connection and would be quicker for us to update the apps on the device once installed.
