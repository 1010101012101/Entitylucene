Mac & iPhone auto reinstall software <body> The day before yesterday, my iPhone just restart, erased and reinstalled iOS by itself. Just one day later, my Mac did the same! Is that a settings problem or maybe a virus?  <comment273414> Or someone knows your AppleID & is remote-wiping your devices... Change your password. <comment273469> But no one has logged in! As Apple will send you a notice if someone logged in!
