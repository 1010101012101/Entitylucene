How can I `brew prune` multiple entries? <body> After many calls with the Apple support, they told me I should reinstall the OS and restore my stuff with the migration assistant. I did it and almost everything works fine so far.  Only codebrew doctor/code shows me a few errors. I could fix the most of them by myself. I just don't know the most elegant way to solve the following error:  precodelocalhost:~ Newton1$ brew doctor Warning: Broken symlinks were found. Remove them with "brew prune":   /usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.07/Resource/Font/xylubt12.pfb   /usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.07/Resource/Font/xylubt11.pfb   /usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.07/Resource/Font/xylubt10.pfb   /usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.07/Resource/Font/xyluat12.pfb   /usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.07/Resource/Font/xyluat11.pfb   /usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.07/Resource/Font/xyluat10.pfb   .   .   .   /usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.07/Resource/Font/blex.pfb   /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/subdirs.el   /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/autotest-mode.elc   /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/autotest-mode.el   /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/autoconf-mode.elc   /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/autoconf-mode.el   /usr/local/share/emacs/24.3   /usr/local/share/applications/emacs.desktop   /usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current   /usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7   /usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Resources   /usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Python   /usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers /code/pre  I think now you know what I mean. And there are much more entries.  So, how I can fix it as easily as possible?  <answer125914> Just run codebrew prune/code â€” this fixes them all in one go.  Run codebrew prune -v/code for verbose to see what it's doing.
