How to stop iPad/Safari from treating certain numbers as 'phone numbers'? <body> I've got some pages on an intranet that show numerical rates to 4 decimal places, eg 147.1453. When these pages are viewed on an iPad, some of these rates appear underlined and clicking on them causes the iPad to offer to create a new contact, or add to an existing contact. Clearly it thinks that the text represents a phone number (which it doesn't really, as we're in the UK and phone numbers are not formatted with periods).  Is there a way to stop this happening - either with meta-data we can put in the web pages, or by changing some setting in our iPads?  <answer1207> In the code&lt;head&gt;/code of your web pages, add:  precode&lt;meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no" /&gt; /code/pre  There's lots more where this came from at Apple URL Scheme Reference: Phone Links.  <comment1040> Just tried this, works a treat. Many thanks! I had a feeling there would be some meta-way to turn this off. :-) <comment5934> Here @Dori, take this badge! :P <comment5954> @calavera - Thank you very much! :-D <comment65534> that worked for me too, but not on iPod 1st Generation's Safari. Is there any specific tag for that old browser?
