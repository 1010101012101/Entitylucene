How does changing appstore category affect my app ranking? <body> My game has ranked alright in Games/Education, Games/Puzzle but I want to see how it will rank in RPG. I am afraid of losing the position the game is at right now. So my question is will it lose its position if I change categories, if so what is the best path to follow when changing categories?
