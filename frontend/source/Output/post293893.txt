Stop the taskbar from coming up when scrolling from the bottom in ios <body> I'm using ios 11 beta with ipad pro 9.7. When I scroll up from the bottom in any app including safari or tumblr the taskbar shows up and interrupts my viewing. This has never happened before. This is crazy and makes the whole device basically unusable for me. How can I turn it off? Or do I have to downgrade to an older ios to get rid of this?  My version is 11.0 (15A5327g).  My ipad model is MLMN2LL/A  <comment370906> Please see [this question and answers](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1714/88313) regarding asking questions about Apple's beta software.  You'll need to [edit] your question to include the relevant info regarding version/build and hardware type. <comment370980> @fsb thanks I edited the question.
