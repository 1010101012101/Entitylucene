Apple ID or password entered incorrectly <body> I just tried to update some apps but it's telling me apple Id or my password I entered is wrong (it isn't). My Apple ID is same as before.   I Then tried to reset my password. Even after that it is still saying my Apple ID or my password is entered wrong. I chose the option to answer a security question and put the correct answer in but it tells me my information is incorrect.  I have been on the phone with Apple support this afternoon for more than 30 minutes and they still couldnâ€™t fix it. I know the information I'm giving is correct but Apple is still unable to help me.   What should I do?   <answer53783> do you accidentally let anyone know your ID and password? You might lose your ID if they change your info. It's likely to happen.  <answer53800> Sometimes the servers go down. If you try again in a couple of hours you may find that everything is back to normal.  I have had this happen on a few occasions.   <comment61495> This space is intended for "questions" ... <comment61557> I would say "What should I do? " is a question
