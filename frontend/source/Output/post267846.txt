Install Homebrew package with all available options <body> Is there a way to install a package and include all code--with*/code options instead of typing all of them individually at the CLI?  To avoid:  precodebrew install ffmpeg --with-chromaprint --with-fdk-aac ... /code/pre  <answer267853> There is no wildcard-expansion mechanism for arguments in Homebrew, so the possibility to select all options, would depend on the implementation of each formula.  Looking at the codeffmpeg/code formula code, each option is handled individually, so it is not possible using the current version.  You would have to modify the formula removing the conditionals in lines like:  precodeargs &lt;&lt; "--enable-chromaprint" if build.with? "chromaprint" /code/pre  Or add a global switch for all arguments; or change the logic to install all by default and make the switches for disabling options.  <answer267855> Disclaimer: I'm not so familiar with grep. Smarter solutions are welcome.br br br You can list all options with this command.  precodebrew options target_formula /code/pre  And you can get all code--with-*/code options with this.  precodebrew options target_formula | grep 'with-' /code/pre  So you can install a formula with all code--with-*/code options by this.  precodebrew install target_formula `brew options target_formula | grep 'with-'` /code/pre  Note that some formula, especially in unofficial tap, can have old options not prefixed with code--with-/code or code--without/code. brbr brbr EDIT: If you want to exclude specific option, for example code--with-zimg/code, you can do that with this.br (codegrep -v 'with-zimg'/code is fine, but codegrep -v 'zimg'/code is shorter)  precodebrew install target_formula `brew options target_formula | grep 'with-' | grep -v 'zimg'` /code/pre  <comment336579> I initially tried `brew install ffmpeg "$(brew options ffmpeg | grep 'with-')"`, which threw a warning: `Warning: ffmpeg: this formula has no --with-chromaprint`, followed by all of the remaining **with-** options, each on a new line. The last line read: `--with-zimg option so it will be ignored`. **ffmpeg** was then installed without any of the **with-** options. <comment336580> I then tried to reinstall using backticks instead of "$()", and the installation process did not proceed past throwing the following warning: `zimg: macOS El Capitan or newer is required. Error: An unsatisfied requirement failed this build.`  I then tried once more using "$()" and the same result as the first installation attempt occurred. <comment336598> Regarding the first comment, you shouldn't use `" "`. This will squash all option into one option `--with-chromaprint --with-fdk-aac ...`, which brew can't recognize properly. <comment336600> Regarding the second comment, you have no way but installing `ffmpeg` without `--with-zimg`.
