How to change me in contacts <body> In my contacts, there is a contact wrongly labeled as 'me'. What should I do so that I can label the right person as 'me'? How do I change 'me'?  I'm using iOS8.  <answer166715> Within the Settings application, go to codeMail Contacts and Calendars/code. Contacts is a separate setting in later iOS versions.   Scroll down to the Contacts section, and change the selection within codeMy Info/code to the correct Contact.  <answer278036> I did the changes as described - it moved the "me" but it didn't take effect at the top of the contact list until I powered the iphone off and then back on.
