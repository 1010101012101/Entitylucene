How to switch tabs in Safari with mouse gesture? <body> In Safari, how to switch tabs using mouse gesture? I try to use the BetterTouchTool, since there's no shortcut to switch tabs, I have no idea how to config in BetterTouchTool too.  <answer22953> Since you have BetterTouchTool, this is pretty easy. Simply choose whatever gestures you want to use for tab-switching and assign them the following keyboard shortcuts:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mq0si.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgEQM.png" alt="enter image description here"  These shortcuts are kbdCtrl/kbdkbdTab/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdTab/kbd respectively. The first shortcut will switch to the next tab, and the latter will switch to the previous tab.  <comment25621> It works, thanks. <comment115670> I don't think that BetterTouchTool has an option for switching between tabs, but they have a lot of other options. I've yet to find a way to switch between tabs using only the trackpad.
