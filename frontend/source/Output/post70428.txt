Using bitmapped Monaco in Textmate <body> When I use TextWrangler, I can use the beautiful, crisp bitmapped 10 point Monaco font:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GbI9D.png" alt="bitmap"  In TextMate, when I select Monaco 10 as my font, I get a much fuzzier rendered vector graphic from the TrueType version of Monaco:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZ6sy.png" alt="enter image description here"  I do like the lack of chrome in a TextMate window, but find the lack of bitmapped Monaco 10 to be off-putting. Is there a way to get TextMate to use the bitmapped version of the Monaco font, or do I need to stick with TextWrangler for that?  <answer70482> I don't know about TextMate 2, but there's an option to disable anti-aliasing in TextMate 1.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vkBIa.png" alt=""  <answer71806> For TextMate 2 you can do the following.  In a Terminal window run:  precodedefaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview disableAntiAlias -bool YES /code/pre  To disable it, run:  precodedefaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview disableAntiAlias -bool NO /code/pre  <comment81946> Awesome! Is that in the font dialog box? If so, it's a feature not (yet?) found in the alpha release of 2. <comment83397> Alas it applies to all fonts, and not just desired fonts, but this is good to know about!
