How do I restore Garageband after accidentally deleting it? <body> I accidentally deleted it thinking it was one of my Garageband files and after Googling how to restore it, I found an article saying it should be free on the App Store to re-download as should the other iLife applications. iMovie and iPhoto have the install option but Garageband only gives me the option to buy for $4.99.  <comment322969> You have a back-up right?  If not, let this be a lesson to you: start backing up.  Perhaps $4.99 is a small charge to pay for learning this lesson...
