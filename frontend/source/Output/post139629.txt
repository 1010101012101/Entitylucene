Mavericks frequently doesn't resolve any hosts after router switch; pings fine <body> After a switch to a new router, I frequently experience that all sites fail to resolve under Mavericks 10.9.4 on MBA mid-2011, both with Safari, Chrome and pinging google.com. It lasts for variable time, from few seconds to several minutes. Same for wifi and Ethernet.  However, during such outages:  ul lirepeated pings to 8.8.8.8 works fine from OS X Terminal/li lisites open fine in Windows under Parallels if network is set as "Bridged", doesn't work when network is set to "Shared"/li lianother Mac (MBP 2010) with OS X Mountain Lion strikeresolves and opens sites just without a problem (checked by a script repeatedly pinging google.com)/strike has the same problem as MBA/li liiPhone connected to the same wifi resolves and opens sites just fine/li /ul  Switching back to my original router seems to solve the problem.  How to debug and resolve the problem?  <answer140501> Turned out the root cause was problematic new router (Sercomm RV6688BCM in my case). After Internet provider replaced it with another instance of the same product, the problem resolved itself.
