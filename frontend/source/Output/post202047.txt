Yosemite fail - how do I revert back to snow leopard? <body> How can I revert back to snow leopard? My machine won't start up. Macbook pro 17"  <answer202077> ul liPower off the Mac and then power it on holding option/li liInsert the Snow Leopard DVD once the grey screen is presented and choose to boot from Snow Leopard media/li liWipe the Mac with Disk Utility (erase/repartition the internal drive)/li liInstall Snow Leopard/li /ul  Your Mac should have come with CD/DVD discs that allow you to reinstall the OS. Boot the system from that media (insert disc hold C while booting) and reinstall the OS. You can order a replacement from Apple or get one on the used market if you don't have yours.  <comment243664> This sounds like an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info). More detail needed - what Macbook model precisely, what went wrong; why you think you need to revert to an older OS... <comment243736> Nice, nice answer. Since the question is simply "how to X" - I've removed the extra backup part. The OP can ask how to back up in a separate question since that's far too broad to answer all the OP needs in one post.
