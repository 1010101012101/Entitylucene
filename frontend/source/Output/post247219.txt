Trouble Mounting Time Capsule SMB share: realpath No such file or directory <body> I'm trying to mount the share from my Time Capsule via CLI (it works fine via the Finder's connect window, but I need to do this remotely). Should be a simple operation:  precode$ mkdir /Volumes/test $ mount -v -o automounted,soft -t smbfs smb://user:password@10.0.1.1/Folder /Volumes/test mount_smbfs: mount error: /Volumes/test: No such file or directory $ ls -ldh /Volumes/test  drwxr-xr-x+ 2 nick 68 Jul 25 10:59 /Volumes/test /code/pre  FWIW: I get the same error if I codesudo/code the commands too. This is on macOS 10.11.6 (El Capitan).  I've tried a bunch of different variations and keep hitting this issue. There's obviously a directory at my mount point and if I make up a directory it gives a different error?!  <comment305023> I don't know but I note that the man page for mount_smfs fives a different URL i.e. no smb: <comment305029> Thanks @Mark but same error even without the `smb:` prefix.  Also same error without the `-o automounted,soft` args too. <comment305030> perhaps the permissions on /Volumes/test are wring make it 777 <comment305032> @Mark unfortunately `777` permissions didn't make a difference either. <comment320268> I have the same problem also on 10.11.6.
