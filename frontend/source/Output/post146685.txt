How to repair time machine after it loses its history <body> I'm running Mavericks 10.9.4 on a MacBook Pro. I do time machine backups regularly to a Synology NAS (behind a Fritz Box router). This worked well all the time. The last backup has been made last Thursday before I went into weekend.  Today I suddenly got the message that my backup is 230 days old, so I started to investigate, since this can't be. TM says, first and last backup are from February 3rd 2014. When I mount TM I also only get this choice to restore data from, so I aborted.  Looking at the logs from today I get the following codekernel/code and codebackupd/code related lines: https://gist.github.com/kassi/f5c3e379d8af21f71415  h3Interesting parts in the log (in the gist)/h3  ul liSep 21 22:08:39: it starts a typical backup (somehow 360 MB require 2.97 GB)/li liSep 21 22:19:13: post-backup thinning reports several lines /li /ul  of the following  precodeSep 21 22:19:13 hamal.fritz.box com.apple.backupd[2349]: Error: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-50 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.

Does someone have an ides what might go wrong when following the hints in https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5087920?start=0&amp;tstart=0?  strongAny clue what went wrong here and how to get my backup history back into TM?/strong  Thx  <answer146868> I finally found a way around the problem although still not knowing what was causing it.  I guess that the last backup (2014-09-22) corrupted the data (for whatever reasons) and with the entries from the logs in mind I was not sure if this backup was really complete. So I wanted to get rid of it.  In code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code the key codeDestinations &gt; Item 0 &gt; SnapshotDates/code had only one entry left, the one from Feb 3rd, although mounting the TimeMachine image showed that all backups are available on the disk.  ul liI picked the above mentioned plist file from the backup drive from the last working backup (2014-09-18) and copied it in place./li liThen I opened TimeMachine which now showed all backups including the one from 22nd (!!) which I then deleted via the gears menu. This took awhile./li /ul  After this process the codeLatest/code link still pointed to the non existent last directory (bug in TimeMachine?), but now I was able to manually create a new backup which succeeded and all subsequent backups up to now succeeded as well.
