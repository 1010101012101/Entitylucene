Unable to drag icons in Dock <body> Running Yosemite 10.10.2 (14C109). The icons in the Dock cannot be dragged. When I click on an icon, it darkens, but then moving the mouse simply removes the focus on the icon. I cannot move the icons around, or off of the icon bar.  Things I have tried:  - killing Dock process  - deleting/moving preference files  - restarting  <answer174275> Do you have Parental Controls enabled? "Allow user to modify Dock" is a setting that you might possibly have unchecked if you have them enabled.  <comment205226> No, this is the main (admin account). And I can remove icons using the context menu, or add them by dragging icons onto the dock. I just can't drag icons around or off the dock.
