Why does my terminal open with "Basic" settings <body> I have a laptop running OS X 10.9.2 and 10.7.5.  On both I use Terminal extensively.  I have Terminal set up open with Homebrew settings on startup on both 10.7 and 10.9.  The issue occurs when I close all open tabs and Terminal windows with kbd⌘/kbd + kbdw/kbd, so that the app is still running but there are no windows visible.  The behaviour of Terminal on 10.7.5 is as I would expect. When I open a new window with kbd⌘/kbd+kbdn/kbd the new terminal window opens with "Homebrew" settings.  The behaviour with 10.9.2 is not what I would expect (maybe I need to have it explained).  Again if all windows are closed but Terminal is left active and I start a new window using kbd⌘/kbd+kbdn/kbd the new window has "Basic" settings instead of "Homebrew". I have checked this behaviour and it is consistent on both a MBP and Mini I have running with Maverics.  Is this behaviour normal?  If so, is there a way to modify it, so that Maverics behaves like 10.7?  <answer128917> You probably just missed a setting. The "Default" button makes whatever you have selected in the Preferences menu the default.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9kuT.png" alt="Terminal prefs" (Selected in red)  strikeI do find it kind of annoying that you can't set Terminal to just open with the default settings, so you have to change it in two places./strike strongedit/strong - turns out I'm completely wrong, it does change the Startup automatically if you change the default. I guess I had the same problem as OP :P  <comment150949> OMH I'm an idiot - thanks. <comment151018> Not sure what you mean by the last sentence — what's the second place it has to be changed? <comment151043> @grgarside The [startup settings](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lk6eN.png). <comment151050> @0942v8653 These settings appear to be linked on my system — changing one changes the other. <comment151052> @grgarside Huh, never noticed that. I think that's new (at least it doesn't exist in Snow Leopard) <comment151053> For the sake of completeness, I'm running OS X 10.9.3. Maybe someone between these OSs could say whether this is true for their version?
