MacVim: difference in syntax highlighting in terminal and GUI <body> I installed MacVim with homebrew, and specified the option to override system vim. It can be confirmed by looking at the version of vim in terminal.  However, I don't understand why the terminal (mac)vim and the gui has different color in syntax highlighting. And I prefer the GUI's coloring. Why the difference and can I set the terminal's syntax highlight the same as the GUI's?
