Why can't I open Dropbox via Launchpad? <body> The Dropbox app is shown in Launchpad. When I click on it's icon to launch it nothing happens and I return to my browser.  Is this normal?  <answer25614> There is no dropbox app - it runs in the background - There is an icon on the menu bar.  <answer25641> Dropbox has no "Window" to speak of. Everything it does takes place either:  ol liOn Dropbox.com/li liVia the Finder in the configured Dropbox folder (NB: right click a file in the Dropbox folder), simply named 'Dropbox' in your home directory by default. Or;/li liIn the MenuBar/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fneji.png" alt="Dropbox Menubar Icon"  Per Dropbox's Documentation, the primary states will be a blue icon with circular arrows indicating a file is synchronizing, or the green checkmark icon like above, indicating everything is up to date.  <comment29073> There is a Dropbox app (/Applications/Dropbox.app), but it has no visible window (just the menu bar icon).
