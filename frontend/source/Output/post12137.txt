Swap SSD between two MBP 2011 machines <body> I installed OSX on an 128gb SSD in a 2.3Ghz Core i7 MBP 2011 and i want to move the SSD instead to a 2.2Ghz Core i7 MBP 2011, all of the hardware is pretty much the same other than the different CPU.  Will this work WITHOUT re-installing OSX on the destination machine ?   <answer12147> Yes, it will definitely work. OSX comes with all the stuff you need to run on almost any Mac hardware (because they control it). In this case, the situation is better, because both machines are very similar.  You can safely switch them.
