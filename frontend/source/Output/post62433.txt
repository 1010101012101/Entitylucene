How to show all annotations at once in Preview? <body> I just got an heavily commented pdf, when I open it in Preview, all annotations (highlights, notes) are "hidden", i.e. do not show up in the left margin. I can display them by clicking on them but I would like to see them all at once without having to click on each of them individually. I couldn't find a menu item but maybe I missed it? Or is there a keyboard shortcut?  <answer71409> This is a workaround, as I couldn't find a hotkey or menu option to do this. Still, clicking  precodeView &gt; Hide Notes /code/pre  and then  precodeView &gt; Show Notes /code/pre  Will show all anotations. I can now see all the annotations without manually clicking them. This worked on Preview 5.5.1.  <answer190076> Click emView/em or emView Menu/em icon in the upper left, then emHighlight/em and emNotes/em.  <answer239969> For Preview 8.1, I was also concerned that all my Notes were minimized (their term, not "hidden"). Solution is to change the default (new since 10.7 I think):     View  Highlights and Notes   Once this is toggled, the Notes again show in margins.   <answer244662> There is a direct shortcut for it now. strongemCmd + alt + 4/em/strong  strongOther shortcuts:/strong   ul liSee table of contents: Cmd + alt + 3/li liSee thumbnails: Cmd + alt + 2/li /ul  <comment72118> What version of OS X do you have? 10.8 only seems to display highlights and anchored notes in the sidebar. <comment72124> I have 10.7.4 and so Preview 5.5.2 <comment103225> Has anyone found a way to do this in 10.8+ yet? <comment150848> In newer versions of Preview, you can review *all annotations* by opening the inspector (`cmd-I`) and selecting the annotations tab.
