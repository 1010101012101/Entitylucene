Don't charge iphone when plugged into macbook? <body> Is it possible to temporarily keep your iPhone from draining the macbook battery? When I'm out and about I sometimes want to connect my [nearly empty] macbook to my [not so empty] iphone so I can tether without using WiFi (saving battery), but then my poor macbook starts charging my iPhone and is drained even faster.  <answer196837> Not possible, you would have to physically alter the USB cord and remove the pins related to power and leave the data ones intact.  <answer196871> That's not possible. Also, modifying a USB cable (as suggested in another answer) is a) probably not a good idea and b) probably won't even work (see this question &amp; answer). Energy-wise, you are most likely better of by just using wifi for tethering.  <comment297629> Would it work to connect the iPhone via a basic unpowered USB hub? That should limit the current available to the iPhone to 100 mA maximum.
