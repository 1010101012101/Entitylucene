Ipad Mini 2 Warranty for Damage <body> I bought my daughter her ipad for Christmas (7 months ago) and she dropped it the other day cracking the screen; you can actually see inside of it at the top.   Does this come with a manufacture warranty and will it cover accidental damage?  <answer244374> AppleCare does not cover damage.  However, AppleCare+ covers up to two incidents of damage:     AppleCare+ for iPhone Every iPhone comes with one year of hardware   repair coverage through its limited warranty and up to 90 days of   complimentary support. AppleCare+ for iPhone extends your coverage to   two years from the original purchase date of your iPhone(1) and adds   up to two incidents of accidental damage coverage, each subject to a   service fee plus applicable tax ($79 for iPhone SE or iPhone 6 or   earlier models, $99 for iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus).   So, if you don't have an AppleCare+ agreement, you will have to cover the damages out of pocket.  <comment301168> Is that the same with the Ipads I have no idea about anything with the pads and phone no a days.
