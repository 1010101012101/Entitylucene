Bootcamp Failing with Error: “The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition.” <body> I can't get past the error screen after the introduction. Originally, the disk was divided in 3 partitions, the primary one with the data,the second one with the OS X reserved and the third one with bootcamp. So I removed the bootcamp partition, and the error remains, so it's my understanding that the disk has to be in one partition. If I delete the OS partition, will I lose any data?  My screen is something like the attatched.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/45mul.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment347154> Boot Camp won't install to an external drive, nor will Windows boot from one -  you need some trickery. https://twocanoes.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205025389-Considerations-for-Booting-Windows-from-an-External-Drive:// <comment347158> @Tetsujin I have an internal hard drive with 2 partitions, one is Macintosh HD the other is OS reserved. The above screen is just a sample, not my actual partitions . <comment347159> 'sample' images are only of any use when they demonstrate the actual issue :/ <comment347160> If I click the minus button and remove the OS partition, will the data in that partition deleted? Or joined in the bigger one? That's my basic question. <comment347162> If you remove any partition everything on it will be deleted, yes.
