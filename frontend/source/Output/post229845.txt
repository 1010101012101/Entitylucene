(Resizing Partitions) br Please help me, Thanks. :(  <comment280552> [Seems to be it couldn't find the system folder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204156), which doesn't mean that the disk/partition is bad (thus the "good" on Disk Utility). You're right on the "no free space" thing, and unfortunately, I don't think we can help further unless you provide more info. What exactly isn't working when you try to add free space? <comment280713> um.....i tried for one day by using recovery mode (cmd+r), but it not working. Then i go to mac internet recovery mode (alt + cmd + r), and open the "old style" Disk Utility, Disk Utility said my disk is damaged, need to repair, and pressed one button to fix it... but all of my data are erased...  i had no idea why the new one (osx el Capitan) Disk Utility cannot repair the fusion disk... <comment280724> Seems like you used a version of Disk Utility that was old enough that it didn't properly support your Logical Volume setup. Do you plan on attempting to recovery your data? <comment280925> no... my backup is out of date....Is the new one Disk Utility that cannot support Logical Volume setup
