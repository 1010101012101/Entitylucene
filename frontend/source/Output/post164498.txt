Where is the bash profile on iOS? <body> Where is the bash profile on iOS, I am jailbroken and can't find the bash profile, I would like to create some aliases and edit it.  <answer164731> The profile used for shells on iOS is /private/etc/profile, however it is recommended to add your own profile file to /etc/profile.d/ which is sourced by the shell when /private/etc/profile is run, using the following script:  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"codefor i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh ; do     if [ -r "$i" ]; then         . $i     fi done /code/pre  I don't know if adding ~/.bash_profile yourself will cause it to be automatically sourced.
