How can I transfer music from my old itunes account into my new one? <body> My family all shares one itunes account, under my dad's name. My family all buy music from itunes but I have definitely accumulated the most, and have spent hundreds of dollars on music. I just got a new iPhone and I will be moving out soon, so I think it is time for my own personal account (I don't want to share iMessage or Facetime anymore). On top of all of the purchased music from itunes, I have tons of music from cds also on my library on my laptop. If I make a new itunes account and connect it to my computer, will all of my music (cd and itunes- purchased) be gone? I only have one laptop, so I need to know how to transfer all of my music from my current library to the new one I will be making shortly.   <comment210376> Non-purchased music can be copied to your new phone regardless of your iTunes account (Apple ID). Purchased music requires the computer to be authorized to play it, and then it can be copied to your new phone. It will never be attached to your new Apple ID, though.
