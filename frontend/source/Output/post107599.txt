Creating InDesign "Paragraph / Character Style" shortcuts on a Mac wireless keyboard w/o number pad <body> Creating InDesign "Paragraph / Character Style" shortcuts on a Mac wireless keyboard w/o number pad.  Does someone have a fix for this problem? â€¦or still is not possible?  <answer150796> Yes. Use the app strongKarabiner/strong (https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). It can remap strongfn + number/strong to strongfn + numpad number/strong.  With strongShift+fn+1/strong you have strongShift+Num 1/strong. It works.
