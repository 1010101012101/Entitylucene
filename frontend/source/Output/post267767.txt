Does anybody have first-hand experience?   If i upgrade the specs, would this the new os work, or is the 1.83 GHz core and integrated graphics card too slow?  <answer267768> I'm afraid that machine is long out of support. the last OS it's capable of running is Lion, 10.7.5  Ref: EveryMac  <comment336042> Have a look at "Mac Hardware Requirements" in [MacOS Sierra - Technical Specifications](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP742). <comment336046> Whats with the downvotes?
