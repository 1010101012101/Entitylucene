MacBook Air Yosemite, strange drivers taking up cpu <body> Last night my laptop became extremely slow, and looking at the activity monitor I discovered two Installer.dmg file inside two Installer drivers taking up 90% of my cpu. When I eject them everything is fine, but when I restart here they are again. I'm not sure what they are or where they came from. Help! Thanks  <comment314155> Specific names or a picture would help, but first thing to do is get [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/antimalware/mac/). Run it, do anything it tells you. Report back. <comment314261> Hi, the drivers are in the /Volumes folder and are just called "Installer". They have names like this /fBxx7o. <comment314267> I ran Malwarebytes and it solved the problem, thanks!
