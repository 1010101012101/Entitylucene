How do I enter a degree symbol – ° – on an iPhone or iPad? <body> Let's say I'm working on my pork belly recipe [I'm not – there's only one you'll ever need] and I want to record a temperature. I don't want to write out "500 degrees" I want to write "500°". How do I do this?  <answer249388> I've looked around for this several times but today I just found its hiding spot – the kbd0/kbd key! Just hold kbd0/kbd until the alternate characters are shown. In the case of kbd0/kbd, the only alternate character is '°'.  <answer249471> ol liHead over to this Wikipedia page and copy the ° symbol to your clipboard from the first sentence of the page./li liGo to the strongText Replacement/strong page in Settings./li liIn the phrase field, paste your real degree symbol that you copied from Wikipedia./li liIn the shortcut field, type any shortcut phrase, like maybe the word codedegree/code)/li liNow when you type your shortcut, the real degree symbol (°) will appear automagically./li /ol  <answer284827> Or, if you're using an external Bluetooth keyboard with your hardware keyboard set to US, type Option - Shift - 8.  <comment309366> Although you found out the answer yourself, I would like to add that googling the character (by name) you want in the browser and then copy pasting the search result also comes in handy :) <comment309370> That's not a degree, Degree: °, Not Degree: º. Side by side: °º. That's to the power of 0. <comment309398> @SBoss Aaargh! You're right! But I guess it's close enough – just a matter of degrees (of eccentricity of the rendered ellipse)! <comment309448> @user3098466 And I've got [a more efficient take](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/249471/180636) on your method.... <comment309449> Let me know if my solution works :). I think you'll enjoy it. <comment309464> Nice! Thanks! 1 more character to go <comment309523> @KennyEvitt So now the challenge of deciding which one you're going to accept (no hard feelings if it's not mine) ! <comment309559> On my iPhone, currently running iOS 9.3.2, the relevant settings seem to be named "Text Replacement"; I couldn't find any 'shortcuts' under the keyboard settings. <comment309561> @SBoss I think my answer *does* result in a degree symbol; here it is – °. I think I just assumed that kbdAlt/kbd+kbd0/kbd on my Mac would be the same as the sole extended character for *0* on my iPhone. <comment309563> Seems like you're right! I didn't bother to check the created symbol on the phone, since the one in the answer was incorrect :) <comment309797> Your answer covers a great feature to know about, and it certainly works, but it turned out that my answer is just a little bit easier.
