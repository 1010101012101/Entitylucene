How should a user of OS X verify whether backed up data comprises everything required for lossless restoration? <body> I'm emmost interested/em in approaches that compare strongboth/strong:  ul lithe original file/li lithe backup/li /ul  – strongafter the time of backup/strong.   I'm aware of two approaches. Others will be appreciated.   hr  emLess interested/em in approaches that verify integrity of:   ul lionly the backed up file/li lionly the file system used for backed up files/li lionly the media used for that file system. /li /ul  <answer55580> h1n8gray.org: Backup Bouncer/h1  Improvements to Backup Bouncer were noted in March 2012 by Mike Bombich, developer of Carbon Copy Cloner.   <answer55792> h1rsync dry run with checksumming to include extended attributes, resource forks and ACLs/h1  h2Basics/h2  From the rsync(1) Mac OS X Manual Page:   precode  -c, --checksum /code/pre  This forces the sender to checksum every regular file using a 128-bit MD4 checksum. It does this during the initial file-system scan as it builds the list of all available files. The receiver then checksums its version of each file (if it exists and it has the same size as its sender-side counterpart) in order to decide which files need to be updated: files with either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer. Since this whole-file checksumming of all files on both sides of the connection occurs in addition to the automatic checksum verifications that occur during a file's transfer, this option can be quite slow.  Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking its whole-file checksum, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option's before-the-transfer "Does this file need to be updated?" check.  precode   -E, --extended-attributes /code/pre  Apple specific option to copy extended attributes, resource forks, and ACLs. Requires at least Mac OS X 10.4 or suitably patched rsync.  precode   -n, --dry-run /code/pre  This tells rsync to not do any file transfers, instead it will just report  the actions it would have taken.  hr  h2Considerations/h2  I emassume/em that when options code--checksum/code and code--extended-attributes/code are combined, the checksum strongincludes/strong the attributes.
