Can I add an external hard drive to Time Capsule and use it for backups? <body> My Time Capsule internal hard drive has failed and doing either a restart, hard reset or a full erase of the drive didn't resolve the issue. The message that Airport Utility gives me is below.  Since my Time Capsule is doubling as the main Wi-Fi router, and it's out of warranty, I would like to consider the alternative of attaching a 2TB/3TB external USB hard drive to the Time Capsule and use that for backups instead. The internal hard drive failure doesn't seem to affect any Time Capsule features other than the backup capabilities of Time Machine.  Has anyone done this before?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/146Yr.png" alt="Screenshot of Airport Utility"
