Remove Re: AW: and other from subject in Mail <body> Is there any possible way to avoid these long "Re: AW:"(and so on) in the subject field of Mail? I know that Thunderbird can replace e.g. emAW:/em (that is the German version coming from Outlook) or emSV:/em (Danish) with the proper emRe:/em. Up to now, I could not find anything similar for Apple Mail.  <answer52482> I wrote a plugin for mail.app which does exactly that. You can find it at:github feel free to use it.  <comment59937> Those German abbreviations _are_ annoying... <comment59938> Its not just German. There is Danish and probably many others. <comment60054> @AndrewJ.Brehm you may see my own answer. Hope it helps you.
