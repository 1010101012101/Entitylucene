How to disable the power management of the CPU on a MacBook Pro? <body> Since few days the battery of my MacBook Pro (Retina 15 inch, running macOS Sierra 10.12.4) is not working anymore.   Since then, my computer performance is really bad: everything is slow and freezing, a bit like when the battery is under 5%.  I tried to disable this power consumption feature. After some research on the internet I found the command codepmset -b reduce 0/code which is suppose to disable the reduction of the CPU consumption.  precodesh-3.2# pmset -b reduce 0 Usage: pmset &lt;options&gt; See pmset(1) for details: 'man pmset' /code/pre  But as you can see it's not working. Any idea how could I disable the CPU reduction?  <answer283063> Searching the man page for pmset (codeman pmset/code)  on macOS 10.11 - El Capitan for anything related to reducing CPU speed yielded no results; though I was able to find an Apple discussion thread dating back to 2008.  I suspect that the user ability to regulate CPU speed was removed at some point.    That said, the issue is that you have a failing/failed battery and it needs to be replaced.  Your CPU is throttling itself down becuase it has detected low reserves in your battery and is close to shutting down; this is by design.  You didn't mention which specific model you had, but generically speaking, you will have to get the top case replaced.  However, iFixit has some instructions on how to replace the battery without replacing the entire top case.  strongemWarning:/em/strong  It's difficult and involves at lot of work to release the adhesive holding the battery in place.  <comment356822> Maybe the reduce option was removed in 10.12? What does it show in the man page `man pmset`?
