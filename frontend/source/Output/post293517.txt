iMac says Storage is full but I only used 10GB out of 1TB of storage...? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/toT83.jpg" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5LSLt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"This is very weird. New iMac. 4 months old, brand new. 1 Terabyte of storage. The Mac keeps saying I am out of storage, but when you add up all of my word docs, downloads, applications, etc., it only totals about 10Gb. Then when I click on "manage storage" it gives me a breakdown of what my computer is using and at the bottom line it says "system: 990 GB" - Shouldn't the system be operating at about 8-9GB tops?!!? I have deleted all surplus items and literally the total of all downloads, documents, files, applications, etc. is only about 10GB but it says my storage is almost full!! Please help!  I put up a photo of the storage management screen before I deleted some more stuff.... This is nuts.  <answer293518> This happened to me once. I used Daisy Disk to figure out where the disk usage was coming from.  In my case, there was a problem with the strongcoresymbolicationd/strong cache, which was growing indefinitely (eating up hundreds of gigabytes).  After deleting code/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd/code, everything returned to normal.  <comment370374> That screenshot says your *System* is using nearly a TB.  Did you buy this iMac brand new from Apple or other reputable retailer, or from another source? <comment370375> This was purchased brand new from Apple. As I mentioned  in the post, the system says its using 990GB, but that's crazy. What could this be? <comment370387> Could you please scan your computer with Disk Inventory X (http://www.derlien.com/) and attach a screenshot? It would be very helpful to know what files take up the most space. <comment370497> Ok, I added a screenshot of the Disk Inventory X scan. See above. It shows that my "log file" is taking up 895GB...
