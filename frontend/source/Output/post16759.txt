How can I make Safari show the URL when I hover over a link? <body> Safari 5.0.1 on OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) doesn't seem to have any status bar in which the URL of a link shows when the user moves the cursor over a link (without clicking)   All other browsers I've ever used do this.     Is there a user preference checkbox somewhere for this?  <answer16761> The URL of links your hover over is shown on the gray status bar at the bottom of the page. The status bar is not always present in a new window, but you can turn it on from codeView &gt; Show Status Bar/code or with the code⌘//code shortcut.  Some pages can hide the status bar and it does not restore if you go to a new window. However File-New Window should always show this.  <answer16767> I believe this strongSafari Extension/strong does precisely what you are looking to do:br Ultimate Status Bar.  <answer16775> There are two options. One is a setting, and the other is a workaround.  Here are instructions on how to toggle the setting using the Menu Bar:  ol liGo into the View menu./li liSelect "Show status bar"./li liNow, there will be a URL that pops up when you hover over a link, and also tells you if it's going to be in a new tab:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CYMwT.png" alt=""  You can also press kbd⌘/kbd + kbd//kbd to toggle this setting at ease.  The second option is a workaround for when you drag links. Here's how to get this feature to appear:  ol liClick and drag the link out of where it will originally appear./li liAt your mouse will be a small box telling you the title of the new window and its URL, although it may be shortened./li liYou can also drag the link to the plus sign in your tab list, out of the window, or in a folder/the desktop to open that URL in a new tab, new window or save it to your computer, respectively./li /ol  <comment18317> BTW, I'm using Safari 5.0.1 on Snow Leopard, in case that matters. <comment18326> It is not always present in a new window. However, it is user-toggleable (**View**  **Show Status Bar**; or the ⌘/ shortcut). <comment18355> Hey, that extension does precisely what I'm looking for!  +1 <comment18357> Good, useful tips, but after seeing the slickness of Ultimate Status Bar, I'm sold on that, especially un-tinying tiny urls. <comment103794> I prefer this answer if only need to show link destination. Use native feature if possible, extention may adding memory usage. <comment105894> Aw yeah. Great info. :) <comment183703> I can confirm it works with Yosemite and Safari 8. <comment314868> This information is still valid as of Safari 9.1.2 <comment321394> Works on MacOS Sierra too ;) <comment334775> Link is dead now :(
