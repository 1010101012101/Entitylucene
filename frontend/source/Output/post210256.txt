Apple Calendar (both iOS and on Mac) not syncing with Exchange server <body> Until very recently my iPhone 6 would show me all my work meetings from my Exchange account and work like normal. After I updated to El Capitan and iOS9, my calendar wiped out all my Exchange events. I've tried to add my Exchange calendar back by either turning the calendar sync off and then back on in the strongSettings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars/strong sections, as well as removing the Exchange account altogether, but it still does not show my Exchange events.  What I see is still this, my calendar with all my events wiped clean.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lvkPg.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am currently running the following version of iOS  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0SjQJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can confirm that the Exchange account is set up on my phone and I have enabled Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and Notes for this account.   I'm not sure what else I should do.   <comment253745> Why did you blur out the model number? <comment253934> Is that needed?
