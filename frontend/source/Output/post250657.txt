Hide Dropbox icons from the Finder menu <body> is it possible to remove Dropbox's icons from the Finder context menu ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o9zm6.png" alt="Finder contextual menu"  I just want to be able to see the text and not the icons. I can't find anywhere in the settings to do this. Any other possible ways?  <answer250810> If you go into the dropbox settings there is an option to enable finder integration(the third checkbox from the top). Just uncheck it, no restart needed. I haven't checked it by myself, but you could give it a try.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZU1Ua.png" alt="Dropbox Settings"   <comment311354> Don't think that's possible. It's an implementation Dropbox itself wrote and it's all or none <comment311567> Disabling the Finder integration did not require a restart of either the Dropbox app, the Finder or the Mac - the changes were immediate when tested on Dropbox 8.4.21 and OS X 10.11.6. <comment311570> As mentioned above i haven't tried it myself, but thanks for the correction on this point. <comment312485> Not to pile on, but this doesn't address the OP's question as they specifically state they still want the integration, but without the icons.
