Why can I not make a hard link to PkgInfo? <body> With bash as my shell, a simple way to demonstrate my question is this:  precodemkdir -p foo.app/Contents cd foo.app/Contents echo -n 'AEgxFXTC' &gt; PkgInfo ln PkgInfo f /code/pre  The ln will fail with codeln: f: Operation not permitted/code  I am on 10.10.5 with a Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) file system.  There seems to be some magic squirreled away in the file system for files named PkgInfo inside a directory named Contents.  The contents of the file does not seem to matter.  What is the magic specifically?  Are there other magic names besides PkgInfo?  Why is it special?  etc.  <comment244608> Hmm... add the absolute path to your hard link. ` ln /path/to/foo.app/Contents/PkgInfo f``. f is in the current working directory. <comment244610> I originally discovered this with absolute paths but I tried it again and same result.  Both paths can be relative or absolute with the same results.  Contents must be within a directory with .app suffix it appears and PkgInfo must be within Contents to get this behavior. <comment364525> Apparently `Resources/*.lproj` files affected too. https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/07/22/xcode-8-illegal-hard-links-prevent-cloning/
