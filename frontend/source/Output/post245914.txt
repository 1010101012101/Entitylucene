Terminal. SSH with Proxy Socks 4 <body> Gday all,  So i'm trying to use the terminal to SSH into a server using a SOCKS4 proxy.  In putty on windows you can tell it the IP and Port of the server. and then set the proxy in the proxy tab (IP and port)  is there anyway i can do this with the terminal on OSX?  Or is there another program i can use?  Pretty much so i don't have to VM windows and use putty  Cheers  <answer245926> You can use codeProxyCommand/code option to codessh/code, which does exactly what you want in codessh_config/code:  precodeHost target # or all   ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -x IP:port %h %p /code/pre  Or directly on command line:  precodessh -o ProxyCommand='nc -x IP:port %h %p' user@host /code/pre  The OSX codenetcat/code might have a bit different switches, but conceptually it works this way.  supCredits: SuperUser question/sup
