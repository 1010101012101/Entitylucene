iCloud Drive - why are some things hidden and others not? <body> I noticed some apps that sync data using iCloud have visible folders in the iCloud Drive on my Mac, yet others are hidden. Why is this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/llFHM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment209781> Just a guess, but I would suspect it would be based off of the app's file handling. If the only files it stores in Drive are special app-only documents, then it would make sense to hide them. However, if the app handles something like MP3 files, it would make sense to allow you to easily add them from your computer.
