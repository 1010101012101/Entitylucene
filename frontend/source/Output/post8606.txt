How do I create a symbolic link to a directory with a space in it? <body> I was trying to create a symbolic link using the following command:  precodeln -s "~/Foo Bar/" Foo /code/pre  ... but it didn't work (i.e. when I go into finder and try double clicking it, it says that it's pointing to an invalid path and prompts me to delete the alias or fix it). I had to rename the folder to codeFooBar/code and then run the following command:  precodeln -s ~/FooBar/ Foo /code/pre  How can I create the link without having to remove the space from the folder's name?  I'm looking for a way to do this in Terminal and not in Finder's UI.  <answer8609> The quote marks are preventing code~/code from being expanded to your home folder, so you need to either quote just the part with the space in it:  precodeln -s ~/"Foo Bar/" Foo /code/pre  Note: exactly how much is quoted doesn't matter, as long as the space is in the quoted portion and the ~ isn't. code~/Foo" "Bar//code, code~"/Foo Bar/"/code, code~/Fo"o B"ar//code etc are all equivalent.  You could also use an escape to prevent the space from being treated as a separator:  precodeln -s ~/Foo\ Bar/ Foo /code/pre  <answer8610> I tested it myself. I don't have a problem with a space in it:  precode    $ ln -s "/Users/joe/test/foo bar"/ linkToFoo_Bar /code/pre  ls shows:  code$ linkToFoo_Bar -&gt; /Users/joe/test/foo bar//code and it works in terminal and finder without any problems.   <comment9194> While Gordon Davisson is right, you should be aware that aliases and symbolic links (symlinks) are different. `ln -s` makes symlinks. The Finder makes aliases. They are almost identical in practical, common use, but it's important to recognize that *they are different*. Symlinks point to a directory path, while aliases point to a file. If you have both pointing to the same file and you move the file to a different folder, then make a new file in the old folder, the alias will point to the moved original and the symlink will point to the new file. <comment9197> @Cajun: thanks for the clarification. It's confusing that finder shows a symbolic link's "Kind" property as "Alias". <comment9205> You can serious quote JUST the space? That's awesome! <comment9206> You used a full path, not the `~` helper. <comment9207> Tab completion is a wonderful thing too, if you were to do this: `ln -s ~/Footab` (where tab denotes the actual â‡¥ (tab) key on your keyboard), if there is only one folder that starts with "Foo" in `~` then it will automatically expand the path to `~/Foo\ Bar/`.
