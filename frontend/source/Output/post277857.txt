How to close all windows of MacOS Finder EXCEPT the foreground window <body> The number of times I want to drop something from the Finder to another application but I'm stopped by endless open windows below. I have never found a simple shortcut to close them all except for the active one.   Could this be scripted?  <answer277860> As far as I can see there isn't a keyboard short-cut to hide all windows except the foreground window. macOS hides emapplications/em not individual windows of an application (and the Finder is just an app).  What you can do is kbdOption/kbd-kbdTAB/kbd to your target application after grabbing the item in the Finder. Basically once you "grab" a file, don't let go of it, but rather, use the application switcher (invoked by kbdOption/kbd-kbdTAB/kbd) to swap to the application you want to drop the file into.  Once the app is highlighted in the app switcher, release the kbdOption/kbd and kbdTAB/kbd keys, which will bring your app and it's windows forward, then you can drop the file on your target window.  I made a quick GIF to show this in action:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gYVXR.gif" alt="Grab Option/Alt-tab to drop in your App"
