How to disable finder folder metadata persistence? <body> Is there a way to tell finder not to save any metadata about folders?  I would love to get Finder to forget how it displayed any folder the last time I viewed it. So when expanding a folder it does not expand the whole subtree I opened last time.  <answer285284> Have a look at Death to DS_Store.  The source code is available on GitHub and the binary is available as well.  <comment359734> Does it stop the finder from remembering the expand/collapse status of folders? <comment359735> Yes, as this state is saved in the .DS_Store file as well. <comment359742> Unfortunately this does not do the trick. The expanded/collapsed state is not persisted throughout system reboots, but during a session the folders stay expanded/collapsed. So this state is probably saved somewhere else too, not just the .DS_Store files. <comment359743> Please let us know what version of OS X/macOS you are using. <comment359745> Using OSX 10.11. I have diabled SIP. DeathToDSStore is installed succesful and has a launch agent, so yes, even after rebooting no .DS_Store files reappeared, and i dont have any .DS_Store files left on my device which i removed with: `sudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;`
