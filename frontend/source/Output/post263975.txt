Where in Mac OS are Shockwave plugins stored? <body> I don't think I even have a Shockwave plugin, unless it came with the browser.  But if I do, I want to remove it and/or check the version number.  IDS detected a CVE-2010-3655 attack aimed at me.  <answer263976> https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-view-and-remove-safari-plug-ins-2260895  Safari--Help--Installed Plugins  <answer263984> Browser plug-ins are generally installed in either:  ul li/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/li li~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/li /ul  and can just be deleted from there. OS X itself will also sometimes move incompatible plug-ins to a 'Disabled Plug-Ins' sub-folder, and you can do that too if you're not ready to completely discard them. (Though in that case, you might as well use Safari's Security Preferences to temporarily disable them.)
