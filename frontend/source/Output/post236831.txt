Jumping via keyboard from album to songs in iTunes' Albums view <body> In iTunes's "Albums" view it's easy to move from album to album using only the keyboard. However, when an album is highlighted (so that the album tracks are all visible) is there an easy way to begin navigating around the tracks themselves?  The closest I've come to a solution is to press Tab 6 times in a row before proceeding to use the keyboard's direction keys--is there an easier way to get the same result?
