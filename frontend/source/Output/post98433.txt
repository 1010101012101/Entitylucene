Recomendations for simultaneous use interactive drawing application for iPADs <body> I need to tutor my nephew in algebra.  He's 3000 miles away.  We both have iPads.  Skype or the phone can handle the voice channel.  I would like an application with the following:  ol liEach of us can draw on our ipad at the same time, Whatever we draw appears on the other screen.  /li liOption for different colors.  E.g. He draws in black, I draw in red./li liAbility for either person to erase/modify their work, with a toggle to switch between 'erase mine' vs 'erase evertything under the eraser'/li liAbility to hit a one button save/mail screen./li liAbility to scroll/magnify screen.  Each iPad has a several viewport on the canvas.  /li liAbility to snap and crop a picture and paste into screen./li liInexpensive./li /ol  In essence, I want to set him a problem, or allow him to snap a picture of a problem.  Then while he works it, I can 'red-line' places where he has made an error, taken an invalid shortcut, etc.  He can correct his error, leaving my redline, I can then check and remove my redline.  Nice to have:  ul liMultiple sessions so I can work with several students at once./li liHandwriting recognition that turns scrawled math into typeset equations./li /ul  So far the programs I've found have one or more of the following limitations:  ul liA:  Only one person can draw at a time./li liB:  Only one color can be in use at a time./li liC:  You can't erase./li liD:  Your canvas is limited to one screen/li liE:  Interaction is limited to WiFi./li liF:  Interaction is one way:  It's essentially a presentation tool./li /ul  <answer99114> I think FlockDraw would be the best app for you. Although it is a web app, you could use it on an iPad by downloading a free Flash browser such as Puffin Web Browser.  h2List of Features:/h2  ul lidraw online/li liunlimited people in a room/li liupdates in real time/li lidifferent colors/li lidifferent shapes/li lieraser/li liability to draw lines/li lione click saving/li lifull screen mode/li ligallery to save and upload images/li liability to type and draw/li lichat/li /ul  h2In response to your limitations and requirements:/h2  strongA/strong: Only one person can draw at a time. - emTwo or more people can draw/em  strongB/strong: Only one color can be in use at a time. - emThe large variety of colors allow for more than people to draw with different colors/em  strongC/strong: You can't erase. - emEraser is provided./em  strongD/strong: Your canvas is limited to one screen - emWell, each person can see the same screen so yes they are limited to it.
