How do I save a specific AC3 audio channel from an iTunes FairPlay protected movie? <body> I am wondering how can I save a specific AC3 audio channel from an iTunes DRM protected movie ? Right now the AC3 audio source is greyed out ! emI am on Mavericks !/em  <comment153136> There is a reason for protection?  Are you asking the Boonie & Clyde question? <comment153158> ok Bonnie :) what is the link to the movie? <comment153159> No, there is no reason ! I was just telling that FYI. <comment153161> sometimes a search for soundtrack or subtitles can be helpful. <comment153173> Isn't there an other way than finding alternate soundtrack ? I thought to Soundflower to emulate a Dolby Digital output and then saving this sound using GarageBand but the last time I tried it it didn't work because the AC3 soundtrack was greyed out !
