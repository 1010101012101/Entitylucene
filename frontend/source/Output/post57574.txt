Is there a newer version of Office for the MacOS anytime soon? <body> I was wondering if Microsoft is planning to release Office 2012 anytime soon ? Shall I wait for it or purchase Office 2011 ?  <answer57579> Unlikely,  "traditionally" new Microsoft Office for Mac follow new releases of Microsoft Office for Windows:  ul liMS Office 2007 (Win) &#x2192; MS Office 2008 (Mac) (released January 15, 2008)/li liMS Office 2010 (Win) &#x2192; MS Office 2011 (Mac) (released October 26, 2010)/li /ul  The currently developed version of Microsoft Office for Windows is MS Office 2013. So you can expect the next version for Mac to be MS Office 2014 which should start shipping anywhere between late 2013 and 2014.  <comment66160> Thanks for the amazing response, along with sources !
