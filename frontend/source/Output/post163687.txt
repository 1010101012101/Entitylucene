Lost iPhoto when switching from Yosemite to Maverickes <body> I have downgraded from Yosemite to Mavericks because Yosemite made my desktop Mac very sluggish. In doing so it completely eliminated iPhoto in iTunes (which I need). I have researched, read forums and blogs and tried downloading several versions of iPhoto - nothing has worked. I am thinking out loud, can you download the latest version of iTunes ONLY (12.0.1 I have found the download site) and keep Mavericks to (maybe) recapture the use of iPhoto? If you have ANY alternatives or ways around I would certainly appreciate the info.  <comment191686> What do you mean by iPhoto in iTunes? <comment191704> are you asking how to download iPhoto!
