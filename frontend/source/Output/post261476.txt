Teamviewer is lowering my Macbook Pro's audio <body> Last week I found out when I am in a Team Viewer meeting, Team Viewer is lowering my Macbook Pro's audio. It sets the audio around 10%. When I put it back at 100% it's not the full 100% (for example, it's hardly to hear my friends on Team Speak). When I quit Team Viewer my audio is back at normal.   Does anyone know what the problem is?   strongEdit/strong  I created a video which will explain the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaiYha6XNno  <answer263326> This sounds like the strongaudio ducking/strong feature, commonly used by video chatting applications to temporarily lower the volume of other sounds.  To turn it off, go to Applications/Utilities/strongVoiceOver Utility.app/strong  Sound  Uncheck "Enable audio ducking".  <answer282613> TeamViewer only ducks the audio device you selected. So if you don't want this feature you should be able to simply select one that you do not need (in the Teamviewer settings, not in macOS).  E.g. I use a codeRÃ˜DE NT-USB/code external microphone as my sound card. I selected codeBuilt-In Line Out/In/code as my audio device. Now TeamViewer has no idea what to do. :)  It's an ugly hack but victor's solution didn't work for me.  <comment356912> I'll try this out the next time I'm using TeamViewer and TeamSpeak at the same time. <comment357880> Tried this out today, this solution works aswell. Thanks! <comment363415> Thanks this worked! (I first got confused and changed the Mac Output Device, but then realised you meant the option under `Team Viewer  Preferences  Audio`). Interestingly upon connecting with Team Viewer  I still get some lowering of the volume, but it comes back up to normal a second later. <comment363666> Sorry I think I might be blind but I can't see the option to change the external microphone? http://imgur.com/a/3Y8X0 <comment363703> @jackdh, if you want to use a headset for TeamViewer and another application that makes sound you need to put both options on build-in device.
