How do you remove Safari 7.0.4 on Mac OS X 10.7.5 <body> How do you remove Safari 7.0.4 on Mac OS X 10.7.5?  <answer173995> If you just wanted to get the old version back, browse this official list of available Safari and pick the version you need. The currently installed version can be deleted by dragging it into Trash (requires admin rights).  <comment204718> Why do you want to do this? Is it causing some sort of problem? What happens when you pull Safari.app to the trash? <comment204722> Do you want to have no Safari at all, or a different version? If the latter, which version do you want?
