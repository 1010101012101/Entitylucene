Removing spotlight icon from menu bar persistently <body> I tried to remove spotlight form the menu bar with the following trick:  precodesudo chmod 600 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  Unfortunately if I repair disk permissions and reboot at some point (or just simply reboot some people tell me), the annoying spotlight thing is back in the menu bar.   I don't want to disable spotlight, just to take off the damn magnifying glass from the menu bar persistently.  Is there a way the works better than the one I presented above?  <answer58865> There are a few apps that can remove the icon for you, I used Bartender to check it works in Mountain Lion:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rg3dM.png" alt="enter image description here"  It will even get rid of Notification Center if you so desire ;)  <answer58866> This works at least up to 10.9.2.  To disable:  precodesudo mv /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle.bak killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  To re-enable:  precodesudo mv /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle.bak /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <comment67791> Won't work correctly if iStatMenu is active. <comment67794> Maybe not, it's in Beta at present, and the OP doesn't say they have iStatMenu running, I don't. <comment67797> Related: [Remove Spotlight icon from the menu bar - Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/32593/remove-spotlight-icon-from-the-menu-bar) <comment67800> will this just kill the icon or actually disable spotlight?  I like spotlight indexing my mail... <comment67801> I'm running iStatMenus and Bartender right now and it's working okay for me.  Thanks OP, didn't even notice Bartender was able to hide Spotlight/Notification Centre! <comment67805> Just the icon...
