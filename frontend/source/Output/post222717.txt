Delete picture from photos view, keep in albums <body> I don't have any Apple products, so sorry if this is an stupid question - I'm an assistant and have been tasked with solving this for my boss. When you open the photos app, you have two options at the bottom: "Photos" and "Albums." Is it possible to delete pictures from the "Photos" tab, but keep them in the "Albums" tab? Or even a way to hide the "Photos" view from being an option? Thanks for the help!  <answer222918> It's not possible.  Think of one as the Library &amp; the other as the Playlist, similar to iTunes.  You can have something in the Library that is not in any Album [Playlist] but you cannot have anything in an Album [Playlist] that is not already in the main Library.  <answer222919> This emis/em (sort of) possible in iOS 9.  ul liGo to albums/li liFind your picture(s)/li liTap the share button in the bottom left/li liTap "hide"/li liIt will ask if you want to hide the picture, stating "it will be hidden from moments but still visible in albums"/li liTap "Hide Photo"/li /ul  The picture will not be visible in the Photos tab but it will be visible in your albums.  To unhide the picture, go to Albums  Hidden, select your pictures, tap the Share icon and tap "Unhide"  <comment269901> It's not possible,  and I don't think there is a jailbreak tweak to do this.
