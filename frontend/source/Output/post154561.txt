How do I collect all of my notes and highlights from iBooks? <body> I've got a lot of highlighting and notes in iBooks that I've read, and would like to be able to collect them in one easy to use and manipulate format (e.g for writing papers and citing quotes).   For example, I'd like a highlight like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zHo5.png" width="550"  to produce something (e.g., in CSV) like      Quod me nutrit me destruit – that which sustains me also destroys me,14,Tamburlane Parts One and Two,Christopher Marlowe,Anthony B. Dawson ed.,Bloomsbury,https://itun.es/us/qSrZ0.l   I can see how to do this (sort of) laboriously, one note at a time, using iBook's "sharing" feature (or copy and paste, of course) but I don't see any way to do it in bulk, for all of my notes from a book, or even all my books.  Is there a way to accomplish this, with an Apple Script or using Automator for example? Or perhaps there is a text or XML file containing my notes and highlighting that I could write a script (in Python, preferably) to parse.  <answer159410> iBooks doesn't have AppleScript support.  The annotations are stored in a SQLite file: code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX/Data/Documents/AEAnnotation//code.  You could try to parse that. This answer gives a link to Digested, which reads that database and then allows you to export your annotations to Evernote, but I don't know what formatting they'll have or if you want to mess with Evernote.  One (possibly) simple solution would be to open the book in iBooks for iOS. You could then email the annotations in bulk to yourself.   ol liOpen the book/li liPress the "list button" to bring up the Table of Contents/li liSwitch to the Notes tab/li liPress the Share button/li listrongSelect Edit Notes/strong/li liSelect All/li liShare via email./li /ol  hr  Edit:  Actually, after reading a comment on reddit, there seems to be a way to export them all from iBooks on OS X as well:     You can export your notes in an email from Notes - Select All - Share (you need to hold ctrl while you right click to retain your selection). Your highlighted portions will be copied into the email with your notes and formatted nicely.   Strangely, on the Mac the application doesn't care about whether the book is copy protected—it will always copy the highlighted portion. The iOS application indeed discriminates though. If your book is copy protected, then only the chapter name will be shared.   That seems to be the only way to do it unfortunately. :/   Using my laptop's trackpad, I had to hold down codectrl + shift/code while tapping on the trackpad in order to bring up the contextual menu while retaining the selection.  <answer182121> I've written a script for this purpose that extracts the notes from your Mac and outputs Evernote export files, ready for double clicking. Perhaps you could modify my script if it doesn't suit your purposes precisely.  In short, it reads the SQLite databases in: ./Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX/Data/Documents/BKLibrary ./Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX/Data/Documents/AEAnnotations  ... and in this case, exports them to Evernote's .enex format.  https://github.com/jorisw/ibooks2evernote/  precode    &lt;?php     /*      *  iBooks notes to Evernote converter      *  by Joris Witteman &lt;joris@jor.is&gt;      *        *  Reads the iBooks Annotations library on your Mac and exports      *  them, tagged with their respective book title and imported in      *  separate notebooks.      *      *  Usage:      *        *  Move this script to the top of your personal home directory on your Mac.      *  This is the folder that has your name, which the Finder opens if you      *  click on the Finder icon in the Dock.      *      *  To export your notes to Evernote:      *        *  1.

I'm still a ways away though from getting the annotations into a CSV or other convenient form. I can't make anything out of the SQL database, and the mail, while nice looking, isn't programmatically accessible. <comment231572> Is it just me, or is this no longer possible in the new version of iBooks? I don't see an Edit Notes button anymore. In which case, how do I export all my notes? <comment234157> @incandescentman It's there for me in iOS 8.4. <comment234168> @fred I mean on OSX Yosemite <comment234395> @incandescentman The numbered steps in my answer above were for iOS. The last part of the answer—the section after "Edit"—is for OS X. That still works for me on Yosemite. <comment246295> @fred (1) I can only Select notes one chapter at a time, have to do it separately for each chapter; (2) I don't have a Share option, just Copy plus Facebook, Twitter, and Messages. [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/fZABGUj.png) <comment252542> So, I'm on el capitan now, but the directions from that reddit comment still work for me. I guess the process does differ slightly depending on whether you're using a mouse or a trackpad. Using the laptop without an external keyboard/mouse, after I have the comments selected using select all, I then press control + shift + tap on trackpad. That brings up this:[screenshot](http://imgur.com/zQONq8s). Comments across chapters are selected. <comment261362> Oh I see. You have to manually click to expand the ▶ for each chapter title first to first display the notes before you Select All. Then it works. Thanks! <comment302886> Apple's famed ease of use! <comment302891> @raxacoricofallapatorius: Seriously. That's some rigmarole just to get a list of the vocabulary words I highlighted. <comment345121> For some reason the "Mail" option is not available in my context menu. Maybe it's because "Mail" is not the default email application on my Mac.  I guess I'll have to resort to iBooks on iOS to do the export then.
