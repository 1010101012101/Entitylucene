How can I select all files within a directory with subfolders? <body> I'm in the process of cleaning up my wickedly bad "Digital Photos" folder. I've got a workflow I like, but I need a better way of selecting the files. What I'd like to be able to do is select a top-level folder and somehow automagically select all the *.jpg files within both that folder AND any subfolders. I need to move all the *.jpg files to a single directory for easier processing, and having to do it one folder at a time after 10+ years of mis-matched filing systems is just taking way too long.  <answer90919> You could also restrict Spotlight to specific folders or file types and then move all the result files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRuV5.png" alt=""  <answer90923> I really like an application called Hazel for this sort of thing. It saves me a ton of time and continues to sort files for me as they come!  <answer90965> I wrote a shell script for you:  https://github.com/tjluoma/move-all-by-ext  It involves using the Terminal, but there are explicit instructions on the Github page.  It won't overwrite files if there are filename duplications, you'll have to find a way to rename those files.  <answer90973> A Saved Search includes subfolders.  Set up something like the Photostream in the Sidebar and/or the Dock trick.   The Search Criteria for that is set by navigating to ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub and choosing kind: image: all (or whatever your specs are.) I think that would at least be a help.  <answer90976> I created an Automator application that does what you're looking for. You can download it here.  It's pretty simple, just drag-and-drop any folder onto the application, it will then find all images in the folder and any subfolders, and prompt you for a destination to copy them to.  If you'd prefer to activate it by a hotkey or the right-click menu, you can make it into a service by following these steps:  ol liOpen the application in strongAutomator/strong./li liChoose strongFile → Convert To…/strong and select strongService/strong./li liChange the first drop-down at the top to strongfolders/strong./li listrongSave/strong it and give it a name./li liemOptional/em: open the strongServices/strong menu within strongKeyboard Preferences/strong. You can assign a keyboard shortcut there./li /ol  Once you've done that, you should be able to activate the service by right clicking on any folder, or hitting your shortcut key with a folder selected.  <comment106820> Feel free to ask questions here or on Github. <comment106883> I ended up doing it the hard way overnight, but I think this (Automator solution) would be the way to go. I've never been able to grok Automator.
