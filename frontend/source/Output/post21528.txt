Does the MacBook Air have a Fast User Switching (Login Window) shortcut key? <body> I have recently purchased a new MacBook Air, with my optical drive equipped MacBooks, there is a codeShift+Control+Eject/code key combination that allows you to lock your system by showing the Login Window for Fast User Switching.  With the new MacBook Air, the codeEject/code key has been replaced with a codePower/code key, so the codeShift+Control+Eject/code combination is no longer possible.  Is there a new key combination available?  <answer21537> There isn't one that I'm aware of, but one could use this workaround:  ol liOpen Automator, create a new Service./li liSet the dropdowns at the top to "Service receives 'no input' in 'any application'"/li liAdd the action "Run Shell Script"/li liPaste this command (all one line) into the action: code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend/code/li liSave the service. You can call it whatever you like./li liYou can confirm that it's there by going to any application menu, going to services, and verifying that it shows up./li liHead over to System Preferences, and into the Keyboard pane./li liIn the "Keyboard Shortcuts" tabs, select "Application Shortcuts" from the list on the left./li liA list of shortcuts should load on the right, with "All Applications" at the top. Highlight this, and click the plus (code+/code) under the list./li liIn the window that appears, make sure that "All Applications" is selected in the top dropdown./li liFor "Menu Title", enter the name of the service you created emexactly/em as it appears - including any punctuation, capitalization, etc./li liAssign any shortcut you like, then click "Add"./li /ol  This will work even if the Fast User Switching menu extra isn't enabled.  <comment23664> Alternatively, if using Alfred.app, you can just launch it and type "lock" and hit enter.  I could not find a built-in shortcut on the new Air, so this is one option. <comment116171> I've switched to just using hot corners. Put display to sleep set to upper right.
