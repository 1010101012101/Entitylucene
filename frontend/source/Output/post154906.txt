Messages app showing unread number after deleted message. Can remove/reset? <body> Just what the title says, I deleted a group message in Messages, but it's still showing the unread number from that thread (see screenshot) and emI can't bring up the group message because I deleted it/em.  Short of having someone text in that group again to make it reappear, anyone know how I can fully delete the thread, or clear the unread number?  <answer214936> Two options:  1) Close Messages.app, then in the Terminal codekillall Dock/code. This worked for me. 2) Identify the message that Messages believes is unread (hover over icon in Dock) and delete it on your iDevice(s).

Sign out, quit, launch, sign in. <comment182347> I had tried that, and many other resets, but nothing has worked. Just started up my computer this morning and the unread number is gone, though. No idea why. Thanks for looking into it. <comment194988> I found [this answer][1] resolved the issue for me.     [1]: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125886/why-does-messages-on-osx-always-show-unread-messages/155201#155201?newreg=141f13b8ff544a099e1cabb466fda6bc <comment288256> The key is quitting Messages before "killAll Dock", otherwise, this might not work.
