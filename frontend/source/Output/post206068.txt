how to move the 'New MacVim Buffer Here' menu into the main context menu? <body> If I right click on a file, I can open the file by clicking emServices/em and then emNew MacVim Buffer Here/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yYNNW.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, this is a bit cumbersome.  How can I move the emNew MacVim Buffer Here/em menu action to be at the same level as the emService/em menu action?  <answer206161> I don't think there is a "clean" way to specifically move a single service item in the context menu.   What you can do is increase the amount of items allowed in the context menu before a submenu is created.  strongIn Terminal.app/strong:  precodedefaults write -g NSServicesMinimumItemCountForContextSubmenu -int 7 killall Finder /code/pre  This will allow up to six elements in the top level menu. Substitute code7/code with the desired number.  Unfortunately, all elements from your submenu will be moved up, not just the MacVim one.
