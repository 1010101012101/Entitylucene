Editing com.apple.atrun.plist on El Capitan <body> I am running El Capitan on several computers and would like to be able to use at to run scheduled jobs in the background.  Enabling at requires editing /System/Library/LaunchDaemon/com.apple.atrun.plist.  Any way I have tried to do this, I have run into a permissions problem: using sudo, logging in as root or trying to change the permissions from the file information panel all result on a permissions error of some sort.    I have tried:  ol licodesudo vi /System/Library/LaunchDaemon/com.apple.atrun.plist/code and not been able to save the edited file./li liCopying to file, editing it and copying back - I am not allowed to copy back using sudo./li liUsing Xcode to edited the fiel through a GUI, cannot save. /li liusing Property List Editor, cannot save, even logged in as root./li liChanging owner, group is not allowed, even using sudo or logged in a root./li liChanging permissions of all the subdirectories in the tree above (System, System/Library, etc.) used sudo, also tried changed disk permissions./li liRun disk utility./li /ol  There must be some way of doing this, please advise.  <answer232869> The file emcom.apple.atrun.plist/em is protected by System Integrity Protection.  So boot to the Recovery HD partition (hold down kbdCommand/kbd + kbdR/kbd while restarting), disable SIP and modify the item:  ol liIn the menubar open Utilities-Terminal/li liEnter codecsrutil disable/code/li liReboot to your main volume and edit the file/li liReboot into the Recovery Partition again/li liEnable SIP again codecsrutil enable/code/li liReboot to your main volume/li /ol
