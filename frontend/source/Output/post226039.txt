How to enable routing in OS X El Capitan <body> I've got a Linux VMware virtual machine (guest) configured with a NAT adapter on a 192.168.56.0 subnet. Its IP address is 192.168.56.128 and my Mac (host) got 192.168.56.1. Guest's default gateway is automatically set to 192.168.56.2 and is able to ping google from the guest. Host's Wi-Fi IP is 192.168.0.2,  I've configured my Wi-Fi router with following routing table to forward packets of 192.168.56.0 to 192.168.0.2 (my Mac)  precodepi@raspberrypi ~ $ route  Kernel IP routing table Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface default         172.16.4.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0 172.16.4.0      *               255.255.252.0   U     0      0        0 eth0 192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 wlan0 192.168.56.0    192.168.0.2     255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 wlan0 192.168.57.0    192.168.0.2     255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 wlan0 /code/pre  But I'm unable to ping guest from any other device on the Wi-Fi network (192.168.0.0). So it's obvious that my Mac running OS X El Capitan is not forwarding the packets from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.56.0  <answer226044> Your router is not responsible to route packets from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.56.0, but the VM host is. You have to keep the static route 192.168.56.0    - 192.168.0.2 on the router though. I don't know what's the purpose of the second route 192.168.57.0 - 192.168.0.2 - probably a second NAT adapter on the  host.  To reach your VM from strongother/strong OS X devices in your 192.168.0.0 network you have to set up a static route on each of the 192.168.0.x machines to the VM host:  precodesudo route add -net 192.168.56.0  192.168.0.2 /code/pre  To make this route persistent add a launch daemon on each of the machines:  precodesudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.staticroute.vm.plist /code/pre  with the content  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;local.staticroute.vm&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;       &lt;string&gt;route&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;string&gt;add&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;string&gt;-net&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;string&gt;192.168.56.0&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;string&gt;192.168.0.2&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  save the file (ctrl-O) and quit nano (ctrl-X).  Load the launch daemon with:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.staticroute.vm.plist /code/pre  hr  If the other devices in the 192.168.0.0 network are Linux/Windows/Android hosts use the respective commands to add a route:  Windows (persistent):   precoderoute add -p 192.168.56.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.2  /code/pre  Linux:  precoderoute add -net 192.168.56.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.2 /code/pre  To add a persistent route in Linux check your Linux distro documentation.  <answer293333> This didn't survive reboot for me in 10.11. I followed these instructions:  precodesudo networksetup -setadditionalroutes Wi-Fi 192.168.56.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.2 /code/pre  where codeWi-Fi/code is found using codenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices/code.  <comment274544> what is this xml? This is the sickest use of XML i've ever come across! <comment274608> This is to reach from other Macs on the network 192.168.0.0 <comment274609> I'm unable to reach my VM even from my router! <comment274825> Yes my VM host is responsible for routing packets from `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.56.0`. So how to make the host(Mac) to do that? <comment274846> @neckTwi Please implement my solution. Report back if you still have trouble. I tested it in a similar environment as yours and it works. **Please change the default gateway on the Linux VM to 192.168.56.1 (because this is the host's=gateway internal address).** <comment274947> Yes I've implemented your solution. I've set default gw of vm to 192.168.56.1(MacHost). added static route to 192.168.56.0 via 192.168.0.2  on the router. and did `sudo route add -net 192.168.56.0  192.168.0.2` on the MacHost. I'm unable to ping the router from the VM. <comment274950> @neckTwi You have to add the route (and/or the launch daemon) on every host in your 192.168.0.0 network except the VM host. And remove the route from the VM host with `sudo route delete -net 192.168.56.0 192.168.0.2` and any routing plist. The VM host **is** the router. It doesn't need an extra route! The VM host is your Mac! The VM is a host but it's not the **VM host**. The VM is a client on the VM host. You don't read my answer properly! And please don't mix/redefine common naming conventions! <comment274980> I don't have any other device connected to the wifi except my Mac. All I want to do is ping the VM from the router. And VM can't even ping 192.168.0.2(Host WiFi IP)! Thank you for your effort to help.
