Can I capture a zoomed-in screen with the "Screen Capture" feature of OS X? <body> Sometimes I use the Accessibility -- Zoom gesture to zoom in on one part of my screen by holding down the CTRL key. But if I do a Screen Capture (using Command (⌘) + Shift + 3), the point-of-view of the image produced is the standard full screen, not the zoomed-in area that I was actually looking at when I pressed the keys.  Command (⌘) + Shift + 4 does not work either.  Is there a way to way to capture my zoomed-in screen?   (2013 rMBP) -- (OS X 10.11.3)  <answer227866> No, because the capture is capturing the pixels that comprise the selected area, not the 'screen' as it is displayed to you.  It's something I've wished for in the past, too.  <comment277799> Why not taking normal screenshot (CMD+SHIFT+4) and then resize the image in **Preview.app** in `Tools` - `Adjust Size...` ? <comment278669> Good tip; manually changing the resolution achieves the same effect. But 1) It takes longer/is less convenient and 2) The resulting resampled image is lower quality than the equivalent zoomed-in screen view.
