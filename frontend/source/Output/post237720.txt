Mac freezes on OSX install and redirects to recovery mode <body> I have a 13" mid-2014, Intel i5 CPU, 8GB RAM and 128GB flash storage MacBook Pro.   I'm trying to reinstall OS X El Capitan. I have downloaded the code.iso/code file from the App Store, and I have created a install disk using Diskmaker X. When my mac reboots and chimes, I boot onto the USB disk and it runs the progress bar as if it was booting off the flash disk.   After a while, it gets to about 80% loading bar and then it automatically boots into Recovery Mode. I tried a different USB and still the problem persists of not being able to reinstall my OS. Other than an internet recovery reinstall. Is there anything else to try?   <comment291324> A couple of questions...how are you downloading an iso from the App store?  It downloads an installer.  Are you booting from CD or USB?  Finally, why are you using a 3rd party utility to create boot media for El Capitan when it's built in? <comment291344> @Allan I also don't understand why he has a .iso, but Diskmaker X is simply an AppleScript which runs the native Installer command.
