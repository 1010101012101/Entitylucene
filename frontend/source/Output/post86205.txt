Specify the resource a virtual machine has <body> I am using a Mac having this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p4osO.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have installed codeVMware Fusion/code, in one virtual machine codeUbuntu/code has been installed with this ressource: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ncNI1.png" alt="enter image description here"   And here is what is displayed in codeSystem Monitor/code of Ubuntu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GuiHL.png" alt="enter image description here"   I need to do some experiments under Ubuntu... I am not sure how to specify well the resource used. May I say "The experiments are run emunder a virtual machine configured to use 2 processor cores among 8 processor cores and 3GB RAM on a PC of 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM/em? Is there a correct and compact way to express this?  <answer86208> I recommend checking the system's specifications from within the virtual machine. Instructions on how to access the specifications can be found here  <answer86230> Just mention the specifications that Ubuntu is reporting, and mention that it was ran in a virtual machine. VMs are designed to allocate the resources they need, so it shouldn't matter what the host machine is.  <comment99456> I hardly doubt you need that many resources for Linux, but whatever. How many processors did you choose? You cannot see that on this VMWare detail page. And a Mac is no PC... <comment99457> So, how could I check how many processors Linux uses? <comment99460> Take a look at /proc/cpuinfo in linux. <comment99462> Thanks, I have checked `System Monitor` and added the screenshot in OP... How could I express `2.50GHz x 2`? <comment99476> Your description seems OK there isn't any shorter way to say this <comment99608> `2.50GHz x 2` is good enough in my oppinion
