Download all music in Apple Music library (iOS 10) <body> I just got a new phone on iOS 10 and I have an Apple Music subscription. I have the setting turned on to automatically download music when it is added, but all the existing music in my library hasn't downloaded. Is there a way to make it download everything, or do I have to do it manually album by album?  <answer253188> This isn't a perfect solution but it kinda works. On the Mac make a smart playlist that matches everything in your library.   img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2eot63c9tc4wieg/Screenshot%202016-09-17%2017.18.34.png?dl=1" alt=""  Then on the iPhone, download that playlist for offline use.
