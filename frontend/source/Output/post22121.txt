find video codec from terminal <body> I'm writing some shell scripts that automatically convert some video files. Except I don't want to run the conversion on files that are already h264 encoded. Is there a way I can tell via a terminal command whether a video has a certain codec?  <answer22135> With ffmpeg : ffmpeg -i video_file  see : http://videotranscoding.wikispaces.com/GetVideoMetadata  <answer22163> This won't work for code.avi/code files (at least it didn't for one I tried), but for code.mp4/code or code.mov/code files, it should.  To list a file's codecs:  precode$ mdls -name kMDItemCodecs "/path/to/some/file.mp4" kMDItemCodecs = (     "H.264",     AAC ) /code/pre  To find files that are movies, but don't have the H.264 codec:  precodemdfind "kMDItemContentTypeTree == 'public.movie' &amp;&amp; kMDItemCodecs != '*H.264*'" /code/pre  <comment24519> Isn't that because Quicktime components don't ship any of the various AVI codecs? I imagine `mdls` is almost exclusively functional to the MPEG series of codecs and not much more. <comment24546> FWIW, QuickTime Player's Movie Inspector *does* list the AVI file's codecs. <comment24547> Good point :). That also goes in line with your public.movie != H.264 in your answer as well. <comment363173> The provided link is broken.
