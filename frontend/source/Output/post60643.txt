How do I access the files in a deleted user account? <body> code/Users/Abby/code is the home folder of a user account that has been deleted. Check out the screenshot:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hmdY.png" alt="enter image description here"  While logged in as codework/code (which is no longer an account I use for work, but I can't be bothered to change the name of the home folder), the files in code/Users/Abby/code are do-not-enter.  I want to get into them to see if I've left any stuff behind, but I can't log in as Abby (since the user has been deleted).  While we're here, I'm not completely sure how I managed to delete this user account without deleting its home folder (or putting its home folder in a codeDeleted Users/code folder). This all seems... quite odd.  I did all this user deletin' and messin' around in Lion and have since upgraded to Mountain Lion.   <answer60646> emHere's a few different ways you can access the old user's files:/em  hr  ul liRecreate the deleted account, and log in with it:  ol liIn strongSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/strong, click the padlock icon and then the plus button to strongcreate a new user/strong/li listrongname the User "Abby"/strong - the OS should ask you emif you want to use the existing home folder/em - choose to do so/li lifrom the Apple menu, choose "strongLog out/strong"/li listronglog in as "Abby"/strong and you will have access to the old account again/li /ol/li /ul  hr  ul liUse the "System Administrator" account to access the files:  ol linavigate to the folder "strong/System/Library/CoreServices//strong" and open "strongDirectory Utility.app/strong"/li liClick the padlock/li liin the "strongEdit/strong" menu, choose "strongEnable root user/strong"/li lifrom the Apple menu, choose "strongLog out/strong"/li listronglog in as "System Administrator"/strong (or "root") and you will have access to the files in "/Users/Abby"/li /ol/li /ul  hr  ul liChange the permissions of the old home folder:  ol listrongRight-click/strong the "strong/Users/Abby/strong" folder and choose "strongGet Properties/strong"/li liClick the padlock at the very bottom of the "Get Info" window/li listrongClick the "+" button/strong at the very bottom of the "Get Info" window/li listrongSelect your current account/strong from the users list/li listrongGive your current user/strong (at the very bottom of the "Get Info" window) to have "strongRead &amp; Write/strong" privs/li liFrom the gear menu choose "strongmake (me) the owner/strong"/li liFrom the gear menu choose "strongApply to enclosed items.../strong"/li /ol/li /ul  hr  emIf you want information on how this occurred, I just answered a similar question yesterday/em  <comment69813> Another way to create the System Administrator (root) user is via Terminal: `dsenableroot` will ask you for the current user's password (if admin), and then for a new root password twice. <comment69825> The answers below are spot on, but I just wanted to answer your last question. When you delete a user you're asked what you would like to do with the Home folder, one option (the default I believe) being keep it in its current location. <comment69860> An excellent set of solutions. I got in via method #1 and am making it permanently mine via method #3. Thank you for your help! <comment69968> victoly! no problem
