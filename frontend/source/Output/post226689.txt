VLC keeps freezing on Mac OS X El Capitan <body> I have the latest versions for both El Capitan and VLC, however, ever since I've upgraded to El Capitan, VLC keeps freezing during playback. Generally to solve this: I have to pause, exit fullscreen, play and wait for it to start playing again. Every time it plays again, there is a grey overlap that comes over the video (which eventually goes away).   I was thinking that it may be a temporary thing but this has been happening to me quite often now. Is anyone else facing this? Are there any solutions out there?  It shouldn't be anything hardware related. I have a pretty decent configuration for a MacBook Pro NR.

The fix for me was to download VLC 2.0.10 - www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html  <comment275283> You do not have the latest version of VLC for OS X, the latest version of VLC for OS X is 2.2.2, so you might want to try it and see if the issue persists. <comment275290> @user3439894 that's a common bug in VLC for OS X. When running v2.2.1 and checking for updates, it does not detect anything new. <comment278319> Thanks for this. It seems to have fixed the problem for while, but for some random reason, this has started happening again. I am on 2.2.2 this time and there are no updates available (I check on VLC's website too). Any ideas? <comment313367> This is happening to me with VLC 2.2.4 and OS X 10.11.6 (Mid 2010 Mac Mini). <comment313611> @Munkymorgy I finally found out that the real reason this was happening to me was because my hard drive was dying. Other symptoms of this would including frequent system freezes and such. I suggest looking into that.
