script to disable exchange account for after hours <body> I'd like to disable the exchange account for the time after work. I can also use my work-macbook at home so I don't want to be distracted by work-related stuff in the after hours.  Is there any way to enable/disable the account automatically?  With mail.app this is possible using  precodetell application "Mail"    set enabled of account "Exchange" to false    // any other account can be listed here end tell /code/pre  But I haven't found a way to also disable the calendar and reminders.  <comment370507> First of all, I'd never use a work-owned computer at home for personal use, whether or not it's permissible, and only use a work-owned computer for work-related activity! I'd also not access anything personal from the work network while at work. If you are going to use a work-owned computer at home for personal use, log out of the Work account and use the Guest account, assuming it not locked out by the Admin. Otherwise, purchase a personal computer for your own personal use.
