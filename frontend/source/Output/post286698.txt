Cannot rearrange full-screen apps in mission control <body> I am having an issue where suddenly I cannot rearrange full-screen applications from mission control.  This has occurred three times in the last week and can be fixed with a restart, but is still very frustrating to encounter.  When I attempt to rearrange the windows by clicking and dragging, they drop off of the screen.    I do have a video of this entire situation occurring, if needed.  For now,  here is an image from that video.    Thank you for any help regarding this bug.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z6I7G.jpg" alt="This image shows that I cannot put my full-screen applications in between each other."
