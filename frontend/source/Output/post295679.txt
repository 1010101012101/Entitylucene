Creating a directory in /home on MacOS Sierra <body> I have this PHP old legacy code that I have inherited. There is hardcode references to /home/project everywhere I can not change them.  I am on MacOS/Sierra and it will not let me create a folder in /home     sudo mkdir /home/myproj       mkdir: /home/myproj: Operation not supported   I am not new to Linux but new to MacOS  I tried sudo as well and still will not let me.  I also thought maybe a symlink but still not allowed.  I tried disabling SIP  precode$ csrutil status System Integrity Protection status: disabled. /code/pre  I still get the same error  precodemkdir: /home/foo: Operation not supported /code/pre  <answer295681> IIRC /home and /net can be used by directory services like AD or OD. They are mount points created by the auto_master file. Usually they are not used for anything - especially on non-corporate Macs.  hr  Comment out the line em/home         auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder/em in the file em/etc/auto_master/em and enter codesudo automount -vc/code or reboot.   Then you should be able to create /home and any further subdir with codesudo mkdir -p /home/subdir/code.  If you are done with your PHP legacy code remove the folder /home and its content and restore the old auto_master file by uncommenting the /home line.  <comment373436> Since you can’t change the scripts - I’ll link this to an article on how to disable SIP. Even root can’t bypass folders protected thusly. <comment373438> i followed the steps to disable SIP. Still same issue. i also updated the description to reflect the changes <comment373440> Let’s get this reopened. Perhaps it’s as simple as `sudo mkdir -p /home/foo` one time after you’ve loosened the SIP shackles. <comment373455> Well done. I am a bit humbled that I confused NIS Automounter setup for SIP. Great write up. <comment373578> The scripts I would guess assume some forms of Linux is /home how do you know that the /home is the only place they have assumed that. You need to look and change all the code to check it safely runs on Unix eg macros
