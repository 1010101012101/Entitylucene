Text boxes in numbers exported to pdf as 'outlines' <body> I'm using numbers to create artwork for printing and the printers say   "If we don’t have a typeface that’s been used in some artwork then our system will substitute an alternative which may not match the typeface the customer wants.  So by saving it as outlines, the text becomes an object ensuring it looks like the customer would like it to look."  They say that some of the text is converted as outlines, in the pdf, and some not but I can see no pattern to what is and what isn't. Some of the text boxes change line by line.  All the text is in boxes, how do I make them objects?
