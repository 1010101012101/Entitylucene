Is there any significance to the dimmed text in Safari 6? <body> Text in the address bar of Safari 6.0 is displayed differently than in previous versions. Prior to 6.0, all text was black  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/woUSw.png" alt="enter image description here"  but in 6.0, all text after the domain is grey:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1yOVs.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any significance to this? Does it correspond to some new feature of Safari?  <answer59168> The point of this is to make strongthe domain/strong of the site you're visiting blatantly obvious. Many phishing scams will use URLs that look very similar, but not emexactly/em identical to the site they're trying to mimic (using things like, for example, codepaypal.com.mysupersketchydomain.ru/code), and this technique (now used in most modern browsers) helps to mitigate that risk even for non-tech-savvy users.  <comment68203> Sure enough, Wikipedia says this is what's going on (without citing a source though). But it strikes me as [implausible that this has any effect](http://www.pcworld.com/article/125739/privacy_watch_protect_yourself_with_an_antiphishing_toolbar.html) at all, and can't be worth the [cost to usability](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57810/safari-6-omni-bar-url-fading). <comment68210> I might add that Firefox and Chrome have both had this feature for a long time, and it's about time Safari caught up. :-) That and the omnibar...
