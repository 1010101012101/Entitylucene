iPhone is dead, will not charge <body> I have an iPhone 4s running on iOS 8.1.3. I've owned it for about 2-3 years now and have taken good care of it physically and hardware wise. But recently my phone had died. I plugged it in to the charger no problem right? I come back about 20 minutes later to see nothing had changed... I tried adjusting the cord, trying to power down the device, rebooting, safe mode, and just letting it sit without the cord and retrying to charge it. Nothing worked; the phone just kept blinking the red battery logo even of 1 entire day of charging. What is there to do?  <answer200644> There are a few possible things that could have happened. I've ordered them (and their solutions) below from most to least likely.  h3Explanations:/h3  ol liYou have a faulty cord.  ul liIt has become frayed on the inside./li liOne of the metallic connectors is dirty./li /ul/li liDust or dirt has collected in your charging port./li liYour wall outlet is not functioning correctly./li liYou have a hardware problem.  ul liYour charging port has become disconnected internally./li liYour battery is defective./li /ul/li /ol  Many of these cause your device not to charge. Thus, powering on your device does nothing.  h3Solutions:/h3  ol liGet a new cord.  ul liManually repair the wire by soldering the frayed ends together and using a heat-shrink to put everything back together. (You probably just want to buy a new cord.)/li liClean the dirty connectors./li /ul/li liClean out your charging port with a folded index card, toothpick, plastic card, etc./li liCall an electrician./li liTake your device in to get fixed. (Hopefully, you have a warranty.)/li /ol  <comment241770> Is it dead, battery wise? Could it be the cord or plug, or even the outlet/strip? <comment241803> You likely need to replace the battery.
