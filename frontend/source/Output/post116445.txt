Title 1, Title 2 number with sub-numbers in pages <body> I'm using Pages to write a document.  I would like titles like :  precode1 Summary 1.1 Start 1.2 End /code/pre  But I only get  precode1 Summary 2 Start 3 End /code/pre  How can I number my titles with 1.1 and so on?  <answer116446> On Pages 13, under Bullet &amp; Lists, just tick strongTiered Numbers/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pL8U6.png" alt="enter image description here"  on Pages 09 it's in the inspector. Select also strongTiered Numbers/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqtAW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer164329> The important piece is to set the style of the subheadings to be Heading 2 when the main header is Heading 1  The number of numbers in the title will then be the heading number  For the set of styles see Matthieu Riegler's answer  <answer184586> From my testing, the following applies:  ol liNaturally numbering emonly/em works when you select strongNumbered/strong or strongHarvard/strong from [Bullets and Lists]  /li liNot so intuitively, if you want the the tiered number 1, 1.1, 1.1.1 etc. to work, you need to do emtwo/em things: check the checkbox [Tiered numbers], emand/em use one or more indents to change from 1. to 1.1 or 1.1.1 etc. /li liStyles have nothing to do with this. I have experimented with using and not using styles. It makes no difference. In fact, if you apply tiered numbers to the style [Body] you can number your paragraphs rather neatly. /li liHowever, I don't seem to be able to include this numbering within a style definition./li /ol  BTW, wouldn't it be great if, in the next version of pages, you could see the structure of your document using hierarchical styles ?  <comment136204> Nice answer, but my Pages does not take the heading 2 as 1.1 .. any idea? <comment136217> The style doesn't matter in your case. Just indent the text you want to see as a second level numbering. <comment310986> How can you define this to be global in the document? I can't seem to update the heading definition.
