Can you use iCloud locked iPhone like an iPod touch <body> i already have an android smartphone and an old iPod touch. I want to upgrade my iPod touch. I was wondering if I can purchase an iCloud locked iphone cheaply and use it as an iPod touch - ie all the features except the phone, as I don't want it for the phone. Or are the features disabled when it is iCloud locked?  <answer229000> If you purchase a phone which is activation-locked via iCloud, you will not be able to use any features on it at all. This is different than a "locked" phone by carrier, which means that it can only be used on a certain carrier (such as AT&amp;T). If that's the case, then the phone will work as a more robust iPod touch.  <comment279216> I don't believe you can buy a locked iPhone. Not from a proper store anyway (are there seriously stores that sell this kind of stuff?). In any case, IIRC, the entire phone is locked to protect the original user's data. <comment279248> I think the OP is asking about. Carrier Locked phone.
