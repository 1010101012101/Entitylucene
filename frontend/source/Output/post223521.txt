Sync Google Keep to Apple Notes <body> I have an Android phone with a lot of notes in Google Keep. Is there an easy way to sync all my notes to my Mac so I can add, delete, and modify notes on both devices? (I've seen some paid apps, but I'd prefer to try something free if there's a way.) Thanks in advance.  <answer252023> Google provides a simple way to get Google Keep on desktopâ€”keep.google.com. It has all of the functionality of the Android and iOS mobile versions of Google Keep, just on Mac.  Here's a simple guide to Google Keep on all of your devices:  strongiPhone/iPad:/strong Download the iOS app.  strongAndroid phones and tablets:/strong Download the Android app.  strongMac/Windows:/strong Use keep.google.com or the Google Keep Chrome Web Store app for easy offline access.
