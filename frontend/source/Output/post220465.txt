Xcode doesn't start <body> I recently downloaded Xcode directly from apple.com (I didn't use the App Store). Now I try to open it, but it just says "Checking Xcode", it loads until the progress bar reaches 100% and then it does nothing.  What can I do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EXRxj.png" alt="Window"  <answer220467> I see that you said that you downloaded Xcode from Apple.com, so you must have downloaded a beta version. The same issue also happened to me when the Xcode 7 beta came out. For whatever reason this sometimes happens when trying to run the betas.  Unless there is a big reason why you can't (some feature you need for app development), just download Xcode from the Mac App Store and you shouldn't run into this issue again.  <comment266835> The reason why I downloaded it from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ was that I couldn't download it from the App Store. <comment266836> @Alex How come? <comment266837> Because it took extremely long and I wasn't sure if it was downloading at all. So I canceled the download. <comment266856> developer.apple.com doesn't only host beta versions. The Xcode Code Signature verification (the screenshot) takes a very long time, since it must verify around 7GB worth of data. Just download it from the App Store, and remember it should take a while. You can check on the progress by going into the Launchpad. <comment267881> I downloaded it now from App Store, it works. Thank you guys.
