Cursor keys not working with vim when using iterm2 Build 1.0.0.20140629 <body> I have just hit this problem, and I have tried all suggested fixes with zero improvement. The version I have running is Build 1.0.0.20140629  It is the large Apple keyboard with the cursor keys next to the number pad - but the cursor keys on the Macbook pro also don't work, as they have been tested.  ol liI have removed the plist preferences file and restarted iterm - no improvement/li liI have selected the Terminal.app compatibility in the keys section of the profile - again it did not help, as per Why don't my arrow keys work in vim under iTerm?/li liInstalled the latest stable and tested then the latest beta - no improvement/li liWorks perfectly with the inbuilt Terminal application - no changes required/li /ol  Any pointers and help gratefully recieved as this is proving to be a real pain.  Waiting to see if there are any work arounds before I file a bug.  <comment163293> I have noticed that you get the error message as follows when you do hit the keys. **E388: Couldn't find definition**.
