.Trashes folder on USB won't delete <body> I am trying to delete files off my 8GB USB Cruzer device, as I often put movies on it to watch on my PS3. When I plug it into my PC, I can delete files off it fine, but when I plus it into my Macbook Pro, it creates a .Trashes folder. When I put the files I want to delete into the trash bin, it goes into this .Trashes folder, but when I try to empty the .Trashes folder, a window comes up saying "Moving "Trash" to "Trash" and it just stays on that window, it does not delete. I waited for an hour and still nothing. I have tried restarting but it still does not work. I do not want to go upstairs to my PC everytime I need to delete files.  <answer87393> The '.Trashes' folder is for OS X to remember that you moved files to the Trash but haven't deleted it. To remove the files from the '.Trashes' folder you need to empty the trash.  You can empty the trash by right clicking on the trash can in your dock and selecting 'Empty Trash'.  <answer87397> To avoid having to go via Trash you can do the following  ul liOpen Terminal (in code/Applications/Utilities/code or via Spotlight)/li liType coderm/code followed by a kbdSpace/kbd (or, if you want to delete whole folders that way, type coderm -r/code followed by kbdSpace/kbd)/li liDrag all the files you want to delete from Finder into the Terminal window (release the mouse after the green + appears)/li liPress kbdReturn/kbd/li /ul  <answer232819> I don't know what is this but I found a solution: - edit the 1 file and corrupt it (it's a code delete the middle line) - save - then delete the .Trash folder and the 1 file they will not come again  <answer269758> I resolved this issue by simply emptying the trash on my computer.  The .Trashes folder also emptied on my pen drive, in doing so.  Hope this works for others.

Their USB drive is empty but useless! <comment335135> This can pose problems if users try dragging in folders <comment335137> @TheEnvironmentalist Good point, thanks.
