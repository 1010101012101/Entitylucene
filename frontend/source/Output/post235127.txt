How can I back my widgets? <body> I love my word clock widget, but today I don't see it. How can I back it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L0xnm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer235335> Go to codeSystem Preferences --&gt; Extensions/code and click on codeToday/code to see the codeWorld Clock/code widget.  Make sure it has a check next to it.  When you go back to codeNotification Center/code, you should see the clock.  I've had problems where some of my widgets would disappear for no obvious reason.  I don't know why this happens but I always end up going back to codeExtensions/code to add them back.  <comment287556> Did you reboot already? <comment287760> @patrix yes, i did, not helped <comment287854> Marked unclear: There is no Word clock widget, i can only find a *Words Only Clock Widget* and Apple's *World Clock Widget*
