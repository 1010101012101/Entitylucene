Error 'The application “Messages” can’t be opened.' after clicking on notification. <body> Messages is open and working, but not the active application. I get a text, the top right hand notification comes in. I want to go to the Messages app so I click the notification and get this error.   The application “Messages” can’t be opened.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FlsW5.png" alt="enter image description here"  But then I just click on Messages in the dock and it works fine?
