Is there a way to turn Wi-Fi on/off using Spotlight? <body> Is there a way to turn Wi-Fi on/off using Spotlight, or do I always have to use the mouse and click on the Wi-Fi icon in the taskbar?  Spotlight is pretty powerful, and I would love to have an easy way of enabling/disabling the Wi-Fi connection. Is there a built-in way of doing this, or do I need to create a script for this, and then call the script from Spotlight?  <answer218099> Not sure if this is the best method, but there's at least one way to set a keyword to trigger stuff in spotlight, and that is by making an application with Automator.   Personally I use Alfred for this type of stuff, but it's not overly difficult to do this with Automator.  ol liOpen codeAutomator.app/code   ul liIt should by default ask you what type of file to make, but if it doesn't kbd⌘ + N /kbd/li /ul/li listrongChoose a type for your document:/strong Application/li listrongStart writing:/strong shell/li liPress kbd↵ Enter/kbd twice/li liIt should now look something like this img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2yZ3x.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liReplace the codecat/code text with: codenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off/code/li listrongSave/strong ( kbd⌘ + S /kbd )/li listrongName it:/strong codeWifi OFF.app/code/li listrongDuplicate/strong ( kbd⌘ + ⇧  +  S /kbd )/li listrongRename to:/strong codeWifi ON/code/li liIn the codenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off/code text, replace the codeoff/code with:  codeon/code/li listrongSave/strong ( kbd⌘ + S /kbd )/li /ol  Now if you open spotlight and write codewifi/code, you should see something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybZjH.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  hr  hr  If you want to change the icons, here's an article explaining how in detail: http://osxdaily.com/2013/06/04/change-icon-mac/  Short version:  ol liOpen the desired image in codePreview.app/code (png works the best) /li liSelect all ( kbd⌘ + A /kbd )/li liCopy ( kbd⌘ + C /kbd )/li liSelect the codeWifi On.app/code in finder/li liGo to file info: ( kbd⌘ + i /kbd )/li liClick the current icon on the top left/li liPaste ( kbd⌘ + V /kbd )  After changing the icons, you might not see them change immediately. You can force spotlight to see the new icons faster by trashing the apps and then undoing it (taking files off the trast)./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oKRDJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongLinks to the icons I used:/strong  ul liWifi OFF/li liWifi ON/li /ul  <comment263629> You could create a script and use the `networksetup` command to toggle its state.  See `-getairportpower` and `-setairportpower` in the manpage for    `networksetup`. <comment263632> This is great - exactly what I was looking for! <comment263633> @nwinkler Great :) <comment263640> Something I forgot to mention. It may be a bit obvious. If you put these app files to dropbox (for example), you can easily use the same keywords on multiple macs. <comment263653> Good answer! Maybe you can make it into a single 'WiFi toggle' app by first checking if the WiFi is on/off with getairportpower and switching accordingly. <comment263671> Automator has automatically stored the files in iCloud, so they can be accessed on all of my machines - incredibly useful!
