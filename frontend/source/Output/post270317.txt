How can I make my MacBook Pro(Early 2011) Faster? <body> I am running the latest version of macOS Sierra.  Some said that my Link speed is to slow to support Sata III.   I don't know what the Ideal ram would be.  Would I see noticeable Speed improvement if I increased Either Hard disk or Ram.  Do I need to update Both? Or not bother with either tough it through.  Any advice would be appreciated :)  Here are my specs: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fluOa.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/byYjM.png" alt="enter image description here"
