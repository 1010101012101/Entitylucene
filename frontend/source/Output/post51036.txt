What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc? <body> To make an alias for the Terminal in OS X, you can either put the aliases in code.bash_profile/code or code.bashrc/code. What is the difference between the two and why would I choose to put aliases in one and not the other?  <answer51038> code.bash_profile/code is executed for login shells, while code.bashrc/code is executed for interactive non-login shells.  When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: code.bash_profile/code is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.  But, if youâ€™ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) then code.bashrc/code is executed before the window command prompt. code.bashrc/code is also run when you start a new bash instance by typing code/bin/bash/code in a terminal.  On OS X, Terminal by default runs a login shell every time, so this is a little different to most other systems, but you can configure that in the preferences.  <answer51043> X11 will look at your code.bashrc/code while a "regular" Terminal will look at code.bash_profile/code  However, if you add the following to your code.bash_profile/code, you can then move everything into your code.bashrc/code file so as to consolidate everything into one place instead of two:  precodeif [ -f $HOME/.bashrc ]; then         source $HOME/.bashrc fi /code/pre  <answer271472> For macOS, the code to put into code.bash_profile/code to consolidate everything into code.bashrc/code is the following:  precodeif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then     source ~/.bashrc fi /code/pre  This is more specific for Mac terminal user.  <comment58374> Not to discourage the unix knowledge here, but bash is a pure UNIX beast so you might get better knowledge or have this question answered several times over on a partner site. There are well over 200 bashrc question/answer pairs over on [unix](http://unix.stackexchange.com/search?page=5&tab=relevance&q=%5bbash%5d%20profile%20bashrc) <comment58597> Or you could just do `cd ~ ; ln -s .bashrc .bash_profile`. <comment121150> These 2 configuration files have a clearly separate function. In some cases, it is necessary to have things to initialize at the beginning of session and only there (`~/.bash_profile`). It is also often necessary to have things to define incrementaly at every shell level (`~/.bashrc`). It isn't the best idea to suggest to suppress this freedom. <comment138717> @danielAzuelos: Lurch left this part out, but the OS X Terminal sources `~/.bash_profile` for every new window/tab, so there's not really a way to separate the two as far as Terminal is concerned. <comment341282> There is .profile as well...
