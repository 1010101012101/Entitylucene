How can I reactivate the fn + arrow buttons that changed in Safari 5.1? <body> Safari 5.1 (Snow Leopard) seems to have disabled the combination of kbdfn/kbd + kbdarrow/kbd buttons for navigation (page up, page down, top, bottom). I know the same can be achieved with kbdoption/kbd + kbdtop/kbd, kbddown/kbd and kbdcommand/kbd + kbdtop/kbd, kbddown/kbd, respectively but I find it rather impractical to use.  Are there any tips already how to reactivate this or do I even have to fear that kbdfn/kbd + kbdarrow/kbd behaviour has been completely dropped in Lion?  strongEdit/strong: Added Lion explicitly to the tags since they seemed to have dropped the emHome/em and emEnd/em behaviour of kbdfn/kbd + kbdarrow/kbd there as well in many applications.  <answer20042> I've noticed that home/end/pgup/pgdown aren't working on my main user account but if I create a new user and log in as them, they all work as expected.  So I figure it's a snipe hunt for some preference/library/plugin manager that is doing horrible things to Safari.  I already purged SIMBL but it doesn't look like it helped.  (edited to add) I poked around some more and I guess I made some changes to my default key bindings at some point - I removed ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict and now PgUp/PgDown/Home/End all work as I expect in a browser, although now I'm stuck with emacs navigation inside of editboxes.  I can manage.  <comment20308> I had never used this before, so I went to test it - it's working for me on 10.7 with Safari 5.1. Maybe a bug/some sort of conflict with something else that happened during the upgrade? <comment20462> Hmm, no idea. I have made some special keybindings before for something similar – but this has never been a problem for any application ever. Going to check this soon. On the other hand, it is amazing how quickly I got used to using option and command for this already… <comment20479> Let me know how it works out. I have some custom keybinds set up for Safari, but this is working.  Possibly relevant - what kind of keyboard are you using? Wired, wireless, laptop's built in? I'm on the full-sized aluminum, no issue. <comment37554> I had the same problem. I had remapped ⇞ and ⇟ to `pageUp:` and `pageDown:` (which move the caret in addition to scrolling the page, unlike the default `scrollPageUp:` and `scrollPageDown:`). But those methods stopped working in Safari 5.1 and some version of Chrome released around the same time. You wouldn't have needed to remove DefaultKeyBinding.dict completely.
