How to remove Yosemite final and go back to Mavericks? <body> I've tried Yosemite on my MacBook Air and I want to downgrade to OS X Mavericks. How do I revert back to 10.9.5?   <comment177700> Repeat.   http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/135677/can-i-downgrade-to-mavericks-after-installing-yosemite?rq=1 <comment177701> That's for the developer preview. This is for the final release. <comment177704> Same process. Same. <comment177706> Have you tried this?  The suggestions made using the developer beta release on that page ... in particular Command-Option-R are ambiguous as to whether that still works even under the developer release ... never mind the final release. <comment177709> Fran√ßois' answer. I cover a Mavericks with Yosemite. He's doing the reverse. It's sound.
