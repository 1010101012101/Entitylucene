How to set up multiple PATHs in the user bash_profile in OSX 10.8? <body> I am looking to set up my laptop for both Python development and Phonegap Android development in OSX 10.8 using Eclipse. I installed the lastest version of Python (3.3) which added the code:  precode# Setting PATH for Python 3.3 # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin:${PATH}" export PATH /code/pre  to my code.bash_profile/code. In process of setting up Phonegap you need to set up the PATH for the Android Development tools with the following line:  precodeexport PATH=${PATH}:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/tools /code/pre  Is it possible to set up both codePATH/codes in the code.bash_profile/code so that Python and Android development can take place simultaneously? Or would I need to switch between the PATHs depending on what type of development I would like to do?  <answer83711> Yes, it is perfectly possible to have both statements coexist happily in code.bash_profile/code. This file is evaluated sequentially from top to bottom, and the same environment variable (code$PATH/code in this case) can be modified multiple times. If you wish, you can edit both into a single command:  codeexport PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin:${PATH}:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/tools"/code  to do both modifications at the same time, but this is no different from your current setup. Happy Pythoning!  <comment96377> Thanks! I've got both the Python and Android commands working.
