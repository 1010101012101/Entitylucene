Where can I see the iBooks available to each country? <body> I would like to see where the English version of a given book is available since in my country only the local translation is available.  Is there anywhere online where I can see the full catalog for a given country?  <comment109188> I'd imagine it'd be the US or UK <comment109189> @Undo Yes, but I wonder if I can do something to be sure of that and to switch my country so I can download items from other catalogs <comment109190> I don't think there's any central place - just guess. <comment109217> You can't normally download items from other catalogs.  If you can't find something in your local store, try the other ebook vendors who provide free ereader apps for your device, such as Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Googlebooks, and Sony.
