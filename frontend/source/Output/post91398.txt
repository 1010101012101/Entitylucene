View local HTML files using web browser on iPad <body> Using a web browser (e.g., Safari, Chrome, etc.) can I view html pages that are stored locally on the iPad? The pages should render properly and execute Javascript/CSS properly.  <answer91401> Since the files are always local to the app in iOS. You can't open a html with apps like Safari and Chrome to load associated assets (js/images/css).   However, You could use apps like Documents to upload the folder and open in app browser (uiwebview).   Should work if the URL to assets in the html are relative.  <answer125944> Atomic browser will work it out!  <answer135324> Not sure if this has been fully answered or if this will do the trick, but i've been using an app called xStand to run zip'd files of index folders locally on the iPad. I need it mostly to run sites on my ipad in kisok mode and this does it all.   you can upload the index (and subsequent folders) as a single ZIP. the app will read this and un-package it. Works like a charm in my limited experience.  http://www.xstandapp.com/english/index.php  <answer158208> You can create Web Apps for offline viewing by adding them to the home screen. To do this the web page must be written using HTML5 Offline Application Cache. See the below link for further details.  https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SafariJSDatabaseGuide/OfflineApplicationCache/OfflineApplicationCache.html  <answer260652> If you want to run HTML, JavaScript and CSS on iOS then I suggest getting an app like Coffe Script at Once  <comment107364> Where are these files stored? <comment123471> As I read your answer, it's basically a no. You can't store documents and have the full browsers open them. Chrome, Safari, etcâ€¦ due to sandboxing. Yes, most apps embed a less optimized web viewer based on the same framework / WebKit as Safari but without some javascript optimizations. <comment147429> Thanks for your answer!
