6th Gen iPod Nano won't play entire song <body> I have a 6th Generation iPod Nano. There are a handful of songs in my library that it will not play in their entirety. The iPod will play a few minutes of the song and then skip to the next track. The songs play fine in iTunes.   These are tracks that I purchased from the iTunes store. They are in the Protected AAC format.   I have done a full restore of my iPod and it didn't fix the issue.  <comment93469> I believe I have noticed the same behavior with my iOS 6 iPhone 4S. Very strange indeed.
