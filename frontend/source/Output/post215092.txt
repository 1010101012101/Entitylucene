Which Bluetooth Headphones Switch Easily between 3 Devices? <body> I am planning on buying bluetooth headphones that I would use alternatively with my iPad, iPhone and MacBook Pro. I saw the bose headphones allow to have 2 devices connected at the same time and that it is easy to switch from one to the other but it's only with two.  Which Bluetooth Headphones are able to switch easily between 3 different devices?  <answer233194> Unfortunately Bluetooth Multipoint only allows two devices to be connected at the same time.  There are some business headsets that can connect to three devices at once, but they cheat - they use Bluetooth multipoint to the phone and ipad and use DECT to connect to a base station on your desk. The base station can connect to the macbook with a USB cable.   <answer294123> AirPods!  ol liYou can switch devices easily  ul liAirplay in apps that support it/li liiPhone Control Center: Swipe Up, Swipe Right to Left, select AirPods in Airplay on bottom/li liiPhone Bluetooth: Force Touch "Settings", select Bluetooth, connect/li liMac Bluetooth in Menu Bar (if not there, go to System Preferences → Bluetooth → "Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar"/li liMac Sound in Menu Bar (System Preferences → Sound → "Show Volume in Menu Bar")/li /ul/li liAirPods auto-pair to devices signed into the same Apple ID (no need to pair via Bluetooth).
