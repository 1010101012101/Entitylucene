Cleanup apache config for Lion Server <body> I have installed Lion Server on my box.  (broke my existing VPN setup, and I wanted to play around with it).  I had a bunch of stuff already setup in apache (some webdav for omnifocus, ical, etc).  Due to my customizations (I'm assuming) the server manager can't really do anything with apache (no ical, webdav, wiki, etc).  What do I need to do to reset to a place where the Lion server software is happy with the way I've got my box setup?    <answer20355> You can restore the web server to factory settings.  ol liTurn off the Web Server service/li liOpen Terminal and run codesudo serveradmin command web:command=restoreFactorySettings/code/li liEnter your administrator password/li liRestart Web Server service./li /ol  <answer30189> If that didn't do the trick,   ol liturn off everything which uses Apache (Wiki, iCal-Server ...)/li lirun the following command  precodesudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ServerFoundation.framework/Resources/xswebconfig restorefactorysettings /code/pre/li /ol  The answer using codeserveradmin/code to reset factory defaults calls the xswebconfig and sometimes you need to force the lower level reset and consider other web based services that may lock and prevent a shutdown of the service.  <comment25739> thanks, that seemed to do it.  Sorry it took me so long to get back. <comment35149> Can you explain what this does?
