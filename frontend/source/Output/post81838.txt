How to find out which process eats up memory? <body> My MacBook Pro has 8G RAM. Recently memory leak offen happened. Page outs and swap used kept increasing. The last time it used ~8G swap space.  But in Activity Monitor, I can't find any process has a large value in 'Real Mem', 'Private Mem' nor 'Shared Mem' column.   I checked the %MEM column in output of 'ps -ev', all processes occupied less than 1% of memory. The full output is put in this gist: https://gist.github.com/aleung/4760556  What the way to diagnose OSX memory leak issue?  <answer246775> Check with this command (will show more processes):  precodesudo ps -awxm -o %mem,rss,comm | sort -nr | head /code/pre  if won't help, check with codefs_usage/code to display system calls and page faults related to filesystem:  precodesudo fs_usage -f filesys,diskio /code/pre  especially page in and out by appending the following to above command:  precode| egrep -i "page_|pgin|pgout" /code/pre  supAdd extra code| grep -v kernel/code to ignore kernel process or code| grep -v 0.00/code to show these with higher time spent./sup  If your swap is big, you can force disk cache to be flushed and emptied by: codesudo purge/code.  Based on my experience, OS X have some issues with managing the memory after higher uptime (when it used all of free memory), so sometimes only full restart may help.  Check also codesudo iotop/code or codesudo vm_stat 1/code commands which may help.

Try `ps -axv` instead, and take a look at the RSS (resident memory in KB) and VSZ (virtual memory, also KB) columns. <comment95191> Memory leak might be caused by Isolator.app. Since I removed this app, free memory  3G for a few days. But this question is still valid, because seeing the output from both Activity Monitor and `ps -axv`, Isolator.app used not too much memory. <comment116720> I am in a similar situation, and would also like to know the answer. Perhaps we should look in the console and system logs.
