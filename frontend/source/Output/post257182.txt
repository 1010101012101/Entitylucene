Messages gives message not delivered warning, but recipient says they received it <body> I have an iPhone 7 running iOS 10. When I send a text message in Messages, I get a message from the application saying it has not been delivered.   Yet the recipients tell me it has been.  strongWhy is this?/strong   <answer285334> I have noticed this only when there are multiple addressees.  I have assumed that the message was not delivered to one of the addresses.
