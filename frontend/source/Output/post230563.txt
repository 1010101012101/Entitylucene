Can I mirror my second and third monitors but not the first for a presentation? <body> Assuming I have an external monitor plugged into my laptop and a projector - I now have three monitors.   I want to be able to see what is on the projector from the second monitor and leave the primary monitor for controlling the presentation.   My question is: strongCan I mirror my second and third monitors but not the first for a presentation?/strong  <answer230564> I don't know how to do it emexclusively/em in Keynote, but it is indeed possible to mirror two of three displays.  Open Display preferences, click the ? at the lower-right of the "Arrangement" tab of "Displays" system preference. To set up a combination of displays showing mirrored and extended desktop images, set up the three displays as an extended desktop, and then Option-drag a display icon onto another display icon to mirror the two displays.
