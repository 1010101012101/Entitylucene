Calendar, reminders... All Gone <body> I was doing research on my iPad mini which involved taking screenshots and then cropping them, my iPad got to 5% so I decided to call it a night. I was about to set an alarm so I checked my calendar to see what I had going tomorrow. To my alarm there was nothing, the "+" to add an event was gray and unclickable. I could not even see US Holidays. I then checked my notes and there were only 3 left (I had at least 15), one of which said I had written it just then when I had really written it in the first month I got my ipad. All reminders had disappeared.   I thought maybe it was that I was running out of memory but I still had maybe 500mb left (I think it's mb, sorry I'm not too good with that stuff)   I deleted enough apps to free 2.2gb and I checked my notes and they had all returned, although my reminders are still missing. And luckily my calendar will now show me US holidays, but all of my events are still gone and I can't make new ones. I'm an avid user of notes, reminders and especially the calendar. So for all of this to disappear is extremely detrimental.   What can I do?  <comment169802> Are they iCloud calendar events? Can you check in icloud.com - do they exist? <comment169813> That's what it was, earlier that day I must have swiped off iCloud from my calendar and reminders along with other things unknowingly of what it was. I noticed this when I checked my notes this morning, the 3 that we're still there were with the account "on my ipad" while everything else must have been iCloud. It has all returned. Thanks!
