Sending SMS from iPhone <body> I have an iPhone but my friend does not. When I send a message, my phone sends it as an iMessage and he doesn't receive it. How do I sort this out?  <answer237567> Go to strongSettings/strong  strongMessages/strong. Check that the type of message that you're trying to send is turned on (iMessage, SMS, MMS, or Group messaging).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lG6TG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment291023> Did your friend have an iPhone prior?
