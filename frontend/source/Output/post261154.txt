How do I re-fuse an unfused Fusion Drive, ideally without formatting? <body> I have a 5k iMac with a Fusion Drive. I had trouble with macOS, so I reinstalled it, and restored from a Time Machine backup using Migration Assistant.  After that, the system has been very slow, and beachballs all the time. Looking in Disk Utility, I find that the Fusion Drive was destroyed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8A56y.png" alt="enter image description here"  Notice that Macintosh HD is within the HDD, and the SSD is unformatted.  Here's the output of codediskutil cs list/code. It seems that there's already a Core Storage logical volume group, but it's too small (121GB rather than 2.1TB):  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 7090C28E-A2D2-49C3-BDA4-0B4C96F499B4     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Offline     Size:         120988852224 B (121.0 GB)     Free Space:   -none-     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume E8FF728C-B2AD-44F5-B9B9-EE0BE22D1782     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Checking     |   Size:     120988852224 B (121.0 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume FCB9BDAF-B3E1-403D-B078-CD967BEDECB3         ----------------------------------------------------         (No properties) /code/pre  And here's the partition map.

But it flags an error on the SSD (disk1):  precode$ sudo diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk1 [...] Logical Volume Group 7090C28E-A2D2-49C3-BDA4-0B4C96F499B4 spans 2 devices Incomplete or inconsistent CoreStorage Physical Volume set Storage system check exit code is 1 Problems were encountered during repair of the partition map Error: -69716: Storage system verify or repair failed Underlying error: 1: Operation not permitted /code/pre  When I run codefsck_cs /dev/disk0/code, it says that it's not a CoreStorage volume, and likewise for disk1.  Has the Fusion Drive become unfused? How do I re-fuse it?   Ideally without formatting or reinstalling macOS? I'll backup just in case, but I hope not to use it.  I looked at codediskutil mergePartitions .../code, but it seems to work only for partitions on the same physical disk. Is there another way?  Ideally using free software, but I'm willing to pay if needed.  This is on Sierra, 10.12.1.  <answer261280> If your disks or volumes don't have a second problem the following steps should work:  ul liBackup your main system volume/li liBoot to Recovery Mode/li liOpen in the menubar Utilities  Terminal/li liGet an overview with codediskutil list/code and codediskutil cs list/codebr Below I assume the SSD is disk0 and the HDD disk1 (compare the sizes)/li liCheck all important volumes and drives with codediskutil verifyDisk diskX/code and codediskutil verifyVolume diskXsY/code. If necessary repair the disks and volumes./li liRevert the CoreStorage LVG (SSD) to a normal partition setup:  precodediskutil cs revert lvUUID /code/pre  This may fail because an lvUUID doesn't exit - then you have to try to delete the Logical Volume Group.  precodediskutil cs delete lvgUUID /code/pre  This may fail also - then you have to "hard-reset" the SSD's partition table by repartitioning it. Finally check with codediskutil cs list/code that strongno/strong Logical Volume Group exists./li liConvert your main system volume (disk1s2) to a CS Logical Volume Group:  precodediskutil cs convert disk1s2 /code/pre  Your data will be preserved. This will assign new UUIDs to the (new) LVG, PV, LVF and the LV./li liAdd disk0s2 as a Physical Volume to the LVG:  precodediskutil cs addDisk lvgUUID disk0s2 /code/pre/li liResize the Logical Volume with:  precodediskutil cs resizeVolume lvUUID 0g /code/pre/li liReboot/li /ul  with lvUUID = UUID of a Logical Volume; lvgUUID = UUID of a Logical Volume Group. The command codediskutil cs addDisk .../code is undocumented but works in Sierra.  hr  The approach may fail because other (unknown) obstacles exist. In my VM it worked.   <comment327042> Yeah- Disk Utility might just look wonky... What does `diskutil cs list` show? <comment327152> Please see the updated question. <comment327193> Please add your system version (just to be sure...). `mergePartitions won't work. Essentially your FD is hosed and you have to rebuild it. It should work by reverting disk0 to a old style disk. Then convert disk1s2 to CoreStorage, add disk0s2 as a second Physical Volume to the new CS Logical Volume Group and expand the 2 TB CS Logical Volume (disk disk1s2=disk2 then) to the full size of your FD. Before writing an answer I have to test this in a VM. <comment327200> I agree with @klanomath; my concern is that you installed Sierra to a 128GB SSD and you are getting the "beachballs"  When you say, you "reinstalled" did you do a clean install and migrate your data and apps or did you just restore everything from TM?  If you are installing Sierra, I would do a clean install and *migrate*. <comment327202> @Allan Sierra wasn't installed to the SSD. disk0s2 doesn't provide a valid hfs+ volume (or no Logical Volume disk2 providing the same). Sierra (or ElCap) was installed to disk1s2 <comment327203> @klanomath - I stand corrected.  Yet, even if restored to an HDD, it shouldn't be performing so badly. <comment327205> @Allan Yep, probably a 2nd problem exists - unknown to us. <comment327292> It's Sierra, 10.12.1. I added this information to the question. @Allan I did a clean install and then used Migration Assistant to restore from the Time Machine backup, excluding OS settings. I suspect that the unresponsiveness (perennial beachballs) is caused by some settings in my home directory, or Applications folder, or "other files and settings", so this time I won't restore from backup. I'll manually copy folders, download apps, and so on, to start with a clean slate. I'm assuming that will help, or at least not hurt, responsiveness. <comment327319> I added more information to the question. Thanks. <comment327320> I added more information to the question. Thanks. <comment327321> @KartickVaddadi Updated answer! <comment327426> To be sure, I repartitioned the SSD, so that no old information lingers to cause trouble later. Your answer worked, and saved me half a day's time. Thanks very much. <comment327566> I have found that a clean install of both OS and the Apps are the only way to go.  I use Time Machine for data back ups only at this point.
