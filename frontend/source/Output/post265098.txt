Apple Remote Desktop screen sharing fails for full screen apps <body> So I teach in a small design school, and I routinely share my screen with as many as 35 students at once in various mac labs on campus. To do this I use Apple Remote Desktop on a macbook pro (osx 10.11.6). There is loose parity between my computer and the labs in terms of generation of hardware and OS version. The labs themselves is wired with CAT6, and gigabit hubs, so presumably we have a very fast connection.  My issue is that whenever I use an app full screen, say a presentation of KeyNote or even Photoshop in full screen, the broadcast connection fails within a minute or two.   Other then full screen mode, the connection is fine. I can even show high bitrate things like video without issue. So, I'm thinking it's not a bandwidth issue, but something about full screen mode and screen sharing itself.   Its as if, when an app goes full screen, it goes into a different 'space' and suddenly ARD loses track of its activity, and suddenly ARD thinks that nothing is happening and times out the connection. Or perhaps its a port range issue, and ARD suddenly starts sending traffic down ports that our IT has as disabled?  I've done a fair bit of searching for anyone else with the problem, but I've not had much luck, so any thoughts are very welcome.
