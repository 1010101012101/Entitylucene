Adding drives to Areca 1882-IX-24 RAID 6 on Mac Pro 2010 <body> I'm adding 4 drives to an existing 18-drive RAID 6. In ArcHTTP I modified the RAID Set, then expanded the Volume Set. This part went fine and ArcHTTP reports back a 60 TB volume as expected  However, I cannot get OS X Yosemite to resize the partition from 48 to 60 TB. In Disk Utility, when I resize the partition, it just snaps back to 48. I had this problem before, but several restarts solved it. Not this time. Tried doing it in Safe Mode and also from a FireWire boot drive (normally I'm booting off an SSD RAID 0 attached to the Areca).  ul liMac Pro 5,1 2010/li liOSX 10.10.5/li li12x 3.33 Ghz/li li64 GB RAM/li liAreca 1882-IX-24 in Slot 2/li liAttached via miniSAS to 24x Ultrastar 4k7000 3 TB/li liFirmware Version V1.53 2016-05-13/li liBOOT ROM Version V1.53 2016-06-14/li liPL Firmware Version 19.0.0.0/li liArcHTTP 2.4.5/li liBlock size is 64k/li /ul  Some console from when I try to resize.
