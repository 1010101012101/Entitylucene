How do I dictate @ to siri? <body> I'm looking to learn how to dictate @ to siri. If there is a general resource to look up how to find odd characters, so much the better, but in US English I'm not figuring this out by myself.  <answer191302> The @ is the strongat sign/strong for siri according to this unofficial guide:  http://www.siriuserguide.com/siri-dictation-guide/  I don't see any official Apple resource but this wikipedia article documenting the Basic Latin Unicode block (which also maps directly to ASCII text) has english pronunciation that works well with Siri.  The things I can't get to work from that table are:  ul li^ - circumflex/li li_ - low line - (but underline works)/li /ul  Also, dictating quotes needs to be with the quote on/quote off command and not by dictating when the quotes should be typed.  <comment227191> Have you seen this?: [Siri User Guide Tips, tricks and tutorials on using Siri on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.](http://www.siriuserguide.com/siri-dictation-guide/)
