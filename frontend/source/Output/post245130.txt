See other's Android location on an iPhone <body> I have an Android phone (Nexus 6P) and my wife has an iPhone 6.  We would like to have the same functionality as codeFind My Friends/code offers, without both having iPhones. Thus, we share each other's location through Google.  I have no problem seeing her location on my Android.  Previously, my wife could see my location using the iPhone codeGoogle+/code app. There used to be a codeLocations/code tab in the app, showing my location. Now, the codeLocation/code tab is gone. The Google support article "See friends' locations on a map" is obsolete.  Is there any other way on an iPhone to see someone else's location information?  We both have location history, reporting and sharing in Google turned on. My wife has both the codeGoogle+/code and the codeGoogle/code app installed and running on the iPhone (and is logged in, of course).  <answer245172> My family—one Nexus 6P user and two iPhone 6 users—is really happy with Life360. It provides just the same service as Find My Friends (letting family members view each other's current location), just cross-platform. It isn't battery intensive, works great, and even has some additional features as compared to Find My Friends.   Life360 is free on Google Play and the App Store.  <answer261819> For Android, try https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.bjuremo.hereiam.lite  It can share with email, text messages or through other apps  <comment302193> Let me know if my answer solves your problem, and if there is anything else I can do to help! <comment302214> Interesting idea. Not a completely free app, though. <comment302257> @KlasMellbourn Everything you can do with Find Friends is free with Life360; the paid tier just gets you added perks! We've been using the free tier for months and have loved it, it has not once let us down. <comment302354> Google+ probably isn't the best solution here, especially since it's being slowly phased out http://www.inc.com/john-brandon/the-long-painful-road-to-finally-end-the-google-misery.html
