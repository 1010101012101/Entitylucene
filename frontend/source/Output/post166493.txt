Is there a way to use TouchID for iTunes and App store only? <body> I previously asked this question for iOS 7.  I am on iOS 8 now and in the Settings for Touch ID, there is a specific toggle for codeUse Touch ID for iTunes &amp; App Store/code.   I turn it on - it tells me that I need to create a passcode (in case Touch ID isn't available).  After that, it makes me enter the passcode to unlock the phone.  Is there a way to use Touch ID exclusively for the iTunes and App Store and also not having a passcode on the device?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pYDp0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer166501> Sorry for my image being Dutch, but you can disable the unlock functionality easily after setting it up correctly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJT4K.png" alt="enter image description here"  No, you strongneed/strong to have a password in case Touch ID doesn't work. There's no way (at least without jailbreak) to get this 'fixed'.  <answer166514> After each time you reboot the phone, it will demand the unlock code. Only once that has been successfully entered will it then allow TouchID.  Same applies to initial login &amp; also iTunes.  Having TouchID enabled makes it always lock when switched off, there is no grace period for switching it back on within the 'lock afterâ€¦' period, like devices without TouchID.  <comment195125> What happens if you set everything up with a passcode and both Unlock and Store are selected and then toggle off the unlock functionality? If that works, you might be able to remove the passcode, no? <comment195134> I'd say the dutch is a bonus :-) <comment195158> I tried this very thing...  Did you actually get it to work?  Because for me it still asks to enter a passcode everytime i lock the phone or it goes to sleep. <comment195163> @bmike Nope...removing the passcode toggles iTunes & App Store off.  Unless I am missing some simple step.
