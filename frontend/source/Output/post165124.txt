How to make Mail use standard signature separator? <body> I am using many signatures under codeMail/code. I noticed that unlike many professionnal E-mail programs codeMail/code doesn't automatically include the standard E-mail signature separator.  The command:  precodedefaults read com.apple.mail | egrep '(--|sep|sig)' /code/pre  didn't let me a lot of hope.  Is there any way to configure codeMail/code so that it will automatically include the standard separator code-- \n/code with any signature ?  <answer165126> You need to manually add the sig-dashes, code--\n/code, to the top of your signatures within Mail.app:  ul liMail (menu)  Preferences  Signatures/li /ul  It may be possible to automate the changing of signatures, see How to change/customize mail signature in Mountain Lion? for details of Mail's signature file format.  <comment193694> This is what I'm doing :). But since I'm using different E-mail clients, and I regularly change my signature__s on them, I would appreciate to avoid repetitive and boring manual work for Mail. <comment193720> You may be able to automate your signature updates or apply bulk changes. The answer has been updated for this possibility.
