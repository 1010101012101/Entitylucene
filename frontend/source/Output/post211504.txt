Apple keyboard produce wrong result [MacbookPro 2012] <body> Few days ago, I had a problem. Suddenly, codeQWERTYUIO/code stopped working. All other keys are working fine. Then I started using a cheap usb keyboard. Today, I Pressed codeQ+W-&gt;/code code'Q+E'-&gt;ยง/code codeQ+R-&gt;]/code codeQ+T-&gt;[/code codeQ+Y -&gt; =/code codeQ+U-&gt; nothing/code codeQ+I-&gt;Left arrow/code codeQ+O-&gt;UP ARROW/code.  Is there anyway to resolve this? I can reset PRAM or SMC because some of the keys aren't working. How can I solve it?  <comment255317> So you are pressing two letter keys together and get strange results? What happens if you press one key at a time only? <comment255322> nothing happened. @patrix
