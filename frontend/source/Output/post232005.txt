How do I make the folders and files wrap on Finder in Mac OSX? <body> The two screenshot below show what I mean. This is a window maximized:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xO0z4.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is the same window but at half the screen width:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yuiju.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, you can clearly see that the folders and files are not all showing when Finder is half the width of the screen. The remaining folders and files are still to the right of the screen and if you expand Finder to your right, you can see them.  I don't really like this behaviour. In Windows Explorer, if you have files and folders displayed along the full width of the screen, when you shrink Windows Explorer to half the width of the screen, the folders and file rearrange themselves so everything is still visible on screen.  How can I get the same effect on Mac?  <answer232009> Right click in the window [not over an icon]    ul liTo one-time reorganise -br Clean Up By  [any choice]  /li liTo permanently reorganise [live updating] -br Arrange By [anything except None]/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J8E9k.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment283419> Thanks - it works. I made it the default way the folders and file are displayed by going to Show View Options and selecting arrange by name going forward then clicking "Set Default" <comment283420> Glad it helped - there's an intriguing interplay between global defaults & individual window settings, compared to MS Windows. You can set a default, but any individual window settings are remembered, so you can if you like set up a variety of looks, per window. It may take some getting used to if your are fresh from MS, but it's very useful as a 'power-user tool' once you grasp it.
