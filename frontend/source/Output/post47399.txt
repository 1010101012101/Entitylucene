What external IR receivers are there for Mac? <body> I have a 13" white unibody MacBook from 2010 which I'd like to use with the Apple remote, to control keynote presentations. According to this question, I need an external IR reciever for the remote to work with my MacBook. Would an IR receiver actually work, and if so, what are my options?  <answer47401> If you're looking to control Keynote presentations and your Mac doesn't have a built-in IR port, you emcould/em buy an external receiver, but I suggest you use either:  ul liThe Keynote Remote app for iPhone. This works over wi-fi and requires only a $0.99 purchase and no additional hardware to buy or set up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NRxIi.jpg" width="200"/li /ul  or  ul liA specialized slide advancer, like this Logitech one. This is designed to be comfortable to hold (the Apple Remote wasn't) and doesn't require line-of-sight to the receiver (which is a small USB dongle) to work. Some of the better ones have a slide counter and laser pointers built in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5rVlf.png" width="200"/li /ul  <comment54296> I love the Apple remote but I have no excuse to buy one now. I have the Keynote remote app and I happen to not like it very much. <comment54297> @Moshe Then I recommend the slide advancer. Some of the better ones even have built-in slide counters and laser pointers.
