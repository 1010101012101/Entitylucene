Exchange Delegate Mailbox in Mail.app <body> Currently I am running Yosemite, I am trying to ascertain if it's possible to add a delegate mailbox to the mail.app. As of yet I have been unable to do so. Unfortunately I cannot have this particular mailbox as another account as it doesn't have the ability to be logged into.  Thanks,  Brendan  <answer178140> I do believe that Mail.app does not have the ability to log into a shared (group) mailbox as I do not believe it understands the things that Microsoft did (very strange and awful things...) to IMAP to get the functionality that they wanted in Outlook.  For that you will need a copy of Outlook for the Mac, it may be available in the App store. not sure if it is free or not...  <answer211187> It is possible and described by Apple in "Mail (Yosemite): Subscribe to public and shared mailboxes"     If you have an IMAP account that provides access to public or shared   mailboxes, you can subscribe to them.      ol   liView account information for the   IMAP account that provides shared and public mailboxes./li   liIn the Account Info window, click Subscription List./li   liIn the list of available mailboxes, select the ones you want to   subscribe to, then click Subscribe./li   /ol      To unsubscribe from one or more mailboxes, select the mailboxes in the   Mail sidebar, then click Unsubscribe.   <answer223100> Actually, the Accounts tab of Mail preferences has no hint of "Subscriptions" or delegation, and the gear icon at the bottom of the left pane in the GUI is now missing under Yosemite and El Capitan. The referral to the Account Info window under Yosemite in the link above is erroneous under 10.10.5.  <comment210791> Delegate as what? been able to read the emails, respond to them, get it forwarded ? <comment210792> as in my user account has been delegated full access to the shared mailbox, and i wish to attach it to mail.app so that i can view emails from the aforementioned shared mailbox <comment210793> ok, got that, so why is it than not possible to log in to it? <comment210794> because this is a shared mailbox it has no associated user account, as such nothing to login with <comment299597> This only seems to apply for IMAP mailboxes, not Exchange ones. <comment333770> Take it from a Jr Exchange admin, Exchange has the option to turn on IMAP (and POP) access. The trick comes in getting the admin to turn it on for you.
