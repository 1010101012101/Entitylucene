mkfs.jffs2 or equivalence on Mac Os X <body> I need to use codemkfs.jffs2/code command on Mac OS X. On Linux, the command is installed with codemtd-tools/code package, but I can't find it from codehomebrew/code.   I tried to build from the source, but I have numerous compilation errors including some linux headers, so I didn't try further.   I also found http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X#mkfs.jffs2, but the link is gone.   I installed e2fsprogs with codebrew install e2fsprogs/code from How to erase and reformat SD card to ext3 on my macbook to prepare it for my raspberry pi, but it installs only codemkfs.extX/code commands.   Why there seems to be no codemkfs.jffs2/code on Mac OS X? Is there any equivalence on Mac OS X?  <comment226310> You have asked the same question (now deleted) on StackOverflow a few months ago without getting any answer, so it might just be that no implementation of jffs2 for recent OS X exists. <comment226326> @patrix: That's my understanding. I just wanted to know if there are possible alternatives.
