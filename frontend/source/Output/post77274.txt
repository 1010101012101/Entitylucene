OSX 10.8 Contacts can't access Active Directory 2003 via LDAP <body> I've recently upgraded to OSX 10.8 and have discovered that the Contacts Application can no longer access our Active Directory 2003 domain via LDAP. I have confirmed that the exact same settings work for OSX 10.7 and Mac OSX 10.6 which are [generalised to]:  precodeServer: dc01.subdomain.domain.com.au   Port: 389   Searchbase: DC=subdomain,DC=domain,DC=com,DC=au   Scope: Subtree   Authentication: Simple   Username: domain\username   Password: password  /code/pre  If I do a search on the LDAP with these setting I just get a spinning progress indicator. Console doesn't seem to display any errors with contacts.  Does anybody know if there are any workaround to getting 10.8 contacts to read AD 2003 LDAP?  <answer81266> Try switching the port from 389 (Apple's default) to 3268.  I had the exact same problem until I switched the port number.    Credit the OS X Hints folks for solving this one.
