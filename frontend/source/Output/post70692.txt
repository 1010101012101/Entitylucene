Need an AC powered iPhone dock with audio out <body> I'm looking for an iPhone dock that has the standard 30 pin connector at the dock but is powered from a typical wall outlet. But also has audio out. This also needs to work with a wireless Bluetooth receiver like the ones they sell on Amazon.   Can someone help me out?
