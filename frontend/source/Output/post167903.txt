Extracting WhereFroms Data to a File <body> I see a number of posts on how to delete the WhereFrom extended attributes data, but I would like to do the opposite and extract the information into a file.  I download Creative Commons photos from Flickr and provide photo credits on my blog.   I would like to set up a Folder Action that extracts the WhereFrom URL from the photo into a file, that way I can easily copy-paste the URL into my blog photo credit. It would also give me an archive of all my downloads.  I tried to reverse-engineer some of the delete scripts on StackExchange but didn't have any luck.  <answer167919> Try this in a Run Applescript Action:  precode    on run {input, parameters}     set filePath to "/Users/UserName/Documents/WhereFroms.txt"       repeat with i from 1 to number of items in input         set this_item to item i of input         tell application "Finder" to set displayedname to displayed name of this_item         set this_item to this_item as string         set this_item to POSIX path of this_item as string         set theFroms to (do shell script "mdls -name kMDItemWhereFroms " &amp; quoted form of this_item)         set allFroms to (do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of theFroms &amp; "| cut -d'(' -f2- |cut -d')' -f1 ")--strip crap          set WhereFroms to "File: " &amp; displayedname &amp; return &amp; "From:  " &amp; (allFroms &amp; return &amp; return)         do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of WhereFroms &amp; "  &gt;&gt; " &amp; quoted form of filePath     end repeat  end run /code/pre  <comment197456> That worked, thanks so much!
