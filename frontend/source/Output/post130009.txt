iTunes Home Sharing and Front Row <body> I know that Front Row is kind of out of date but I'd like to get this working.  Two devices, a Mac Mini with 10.6.8 (freshly installed) and a Win7 64 PC. I enabled Home Share from PC iTunes; when I go to iTunes on the Mini the remote library will show/play fine. However, if I open Front Row, and attempt to change the library Source to the win7 pc, it just sits there forever at Loading Library.     To eliminate the PC as the issue I tried the same from my laptop and the Front Row hangs again at loading laptop library (this library is empty so its not an issue of size).  Have tried all updates etc, cleared plists, no errors in console.  Thank you  <comment152770> Which iTunes version are you using? It might be a compatibility problem: iTunes was updated regularly, but Front Row not.
