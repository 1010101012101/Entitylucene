I want a twitter feed to alert my iPhone <body> On my iPhone, I'd like to get a push alert when there's a new tweet from a twitter account.  How can I achieve this?  <answer15628> boxcar, which is a beautiful little app, offers this functionality. It's a free download from the app store.   <answer266414> You can now turn on notifications for users you follow on iOS 10 by clicking on the bell icon near the top right.  <comment16992> Looks good but is broken in 5.0 <comment17012> Push alert for every new tweet? <comment17071> Can you give some more detail about the problem you're having?
