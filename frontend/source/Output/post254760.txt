How to create an installer *.pkg with an *.app and sqlite3 database <body> As a new Mac user I'm looking for help on how to create an installer (*.pkg) for Mac which should copy the *.app file into code~/Applications/MyApp/code and a sqlite3 database into code~/Library/Application Support/MyApp/MyAppDB.sqlite3/code setting the right file permissions?   I've tried Packages but it was unable to copy the db file into code~/Library/Application Support//code...   How to do that?   Thanks!  <comment317200> That should be part of your startup code in the Application - check if there is a file in ~/Library/Application Support/MyApp/MyAppDB.sqlite3 if not create it or copy from your app byundle (or does Core Data do this for you)
