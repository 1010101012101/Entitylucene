MacBook Pro stuck on grey screen with Apple logo and spinning wheel <body> The only thing it will let me do is booting to Safe Mode. After running code/sbin/fsck_hfs -drfy /dev/disk0s2/code it returned with an incorrect number of extended attributes (it should be 486802 instead of 486801) and disk0s2: i/o error. code**the volume macintosh could not be verified completely.**/code  Running the command once more it returns:     precode**the volume macintosh could not be verified completely.** volume check failed with error 5 volume type is pure HFS+ primary MDB is at block 0 0x00 alternate MDB is at block 0 0x00 primary VHB is at block 2 0x02 alternate VHB is at block 623463230 0x25294b3e sector size = 512 0x200 volumeObject flags = 0x07 total sectors for volume = 623463232 0x25294b40 total sectors for embedded volume - 0 0x00 checkHFS returned 5, fsmodified = 1 *****the volume was modified ***** doing update / reload mount for / now :/root#  sw_vers: Mac OS X 10.9.5 /code/pre  I don't know what to do now. I really am trying to do this myself without spending any money or as little as possible. And I cannot do anything that will wipe out all of the info that is on it.  <answer251170> I/O errors are usually bad news- often a sign of failing hardware. :(  If you don't have a backup already be sure to make one ASAP. For example, try booting in target disk mode (hold the codeT/code key while starting up) and connecting to another Mac. From there make a copy and try running Disk Utility to repair the volume.  <comment312150> The key there is the error "volume check failed with error 5"  This is more often than not a physical hard drive failure - meaning you will have to get a new drive.  I wrote an [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/231920/119271) that is applicable to your question.  Also, you might want to take a look at [Repair disk from single user mode (fsck fails)](http://bit.ly/2bWiX3s) as it is vert similar and relevant to your situation. <comment312152> Also you should  check your drive's SMART status to verify if it has any errors.  Issue this command in Terminal:  `diskutil info disk0 | grep -i smart` and post the results.
