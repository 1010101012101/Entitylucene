Force style of push notification? <body> I was wondering - is there a way to strongforce how a push notification will appear/strong to the iPhone user? There are em3 options/em in settings for the user to choose - strongnone/strong, some kind of top strongbanner/strong that dissappears after a short time and an strongalert/strong with buttons.  The problem is, while developing an application for iPhone, I found out that using the strongemdidReceiveRemoteNotification/em/strong function did not return any results if I didn't click on that top banner. This doesn't seem to be firing up even when the application is taken to the foreground.  I need those data provided by this function to act upon in my application.  Thanks for your time!  <answer51617> Yep, there is no way for you to do this. Check this answer and the comments below. Probably you should implement another method to poll for events while app is running.  ps.
