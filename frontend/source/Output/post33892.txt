Transmission aborts automated shut down. <body> My ISP offers unlimited downloads at a certain time period at night, but I don't want to wake up to shutdown my MBP 13.3 at that time. I tried to specify a certain shutdown time using the Energy Saver option.  However, I found out to my utter dismay that strongTransmisison needs to be explicitly/strong closed before it for the computer to shut down.  <answer34519> ol liIn Transmission go to the preferences/li liuncheck strongSystem sleep/strong under Network img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gK36W.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liuncheck strongQuit with active transfers/strong under General img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pri8L.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <comment38686> I assume you are using **Transmission**? Check this option in the Transmission preferences: **``Network-System Sleep``** <comment38688> Well, I'm using Transmission! But the option says "Prevent computer from sleeping with active transfers" - I fear if i uncheck it, my MBP would goto sleep within moments of my leaving it, stalling my transfers long before the desired time. Are you sure this is a good idea ? <comment38691> I'm sure this is necessary for the computer to shut down. Uncheck this option, then simply disable **``Computer sleep``** in the system settings for ``Energy Saver``. You do not have to disable **``Display Sleep``**. <comment39428> @Matt - I found out I also need to uncheck "Prompt user for - Quit with active transfer" in Transmission for this to work. With that, it works like a charm! <comment39433> Great to hear that. I'll add an answer then. I think we should also edit your question in order to clarify that this problem was linked to Transmission.
