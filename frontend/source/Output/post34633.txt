Why does the iPhone 4S weigh more than the iPhone 4? <body> It's been commonly noted that the iPhone 4S looks the same, but that its internals have been upgraded. Despite that, the iPhone 4S weighs more.  What causes the added weight?  <answer34684> Just because eminternal/em hardware has been upgraded, this does not mean that the phone will not weigh more.  After all, emupgraded/em hardware is emdifferent/em hardware.  Still, if that is not sufficient to you take a look at the teardown of the two phones. You will see that the internal design differs, which can cause weight difference.  ul liteardown iPhone 4/li liteardown iPhone 4s/li /ul  <comment47473> 2 things to bear in mind.  Each gen of chips is manufactured smaller than the last.  Also, any spare space created by shrinking the chippery etc will be gobbled up by a bigger battery.  The single biggest and heaviest part of the iPhone 4 ($ derivatives, CDMA, 4S, etc) is that big 'ol battery.  Same goes for iPad.
