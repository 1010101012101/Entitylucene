How much RAM do you have available after you restart your Mac and do not have any running applications? <body> I am trying to figure out the issues of my Mac's performance. I currently have 2.75 GB / 4 GB RAM available after I restart my laptop and do not have any running apps at all.  I'm currently running the latest version of Mavericks.  <comment126229> possible duplicate of [Why is my RAM nearly fully used?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25489/why-is-my-ram-nearly-fully-used) <comment126235> There are several questions around performance analysis in general with some good answers already on this site: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46324/do-computers-slow-down-as-they-age, http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47437/mac-book-pro-is-very-slow, http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28574/mac-mini-suddently-terribly-slow. Instead of assuming it's a memory issue, can you try the answers there and (if your problem isn't solved) come back, update the question with your findings and have it reopened?
