MBP 2013 keyboard & trackpad freeze after USB disconnect while sleeping <body> MacBook Pro 2013 retina. Sometimes I plug my phone into one of the USB ports to charge it. Sometimes I close the MBP and let the phone keep charging. Sometimes I then unplug the phone without waking up the MBP. Sometimes (not always -- just intermittently) when I do open the MBP again after this sequence, the keyboard and trackpad no longer work. An external mouse still works fine. But no combination of switching plugs, re-attaching the phone, sleep/wake, will get me the use of the keyboard again. I'm stuck at the screen saver login page with nothing but an external mouse (can't type password, no option to shut down cleanly). I have to force shutdown by holding down the power button, which is not ideal.  Does anybody know a way to un-wedge at this point or re-enable the trackpad + keyboard? I'd love to be able to just get back to work again, or at the very least do a clean logout and shutdown without a force reset.  <answer280590> strongWorkaround/strong  When you find yourself in this situation, you emshould/em be able to just strongbriefly/strong press the kbdpower button/kbd. Just a quick half-second press. In doing so you'll be prompted to restart, shutdown, etc.  strongPotential fix/strong  It may be worth you resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) to see whether this resolves the issue in the longer term.  To do this on your model of MBP, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your MBP/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the strongleft/strong side of the strongbuilt-in/strong keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  strongSome tests/strong  Have you tested to see whether this behaviour is replicated on all USB ports?  Another test would be to boot into Safe Mode and see if it is replicated, either during Safe Mode or again afterwards. I understand it's an intermittent issue, so these sorts of tests will require determination/patience.  To boot into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTry testing for the same behaviour/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li /ol
