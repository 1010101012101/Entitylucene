Cannot Create a User Account on Mac OS X 10.5.8 Leopard <body> I am having trouble with iMac running OS X 10.5.8. I used to be all the time in the administrator account (mine) but I forgot my password so I did the reboot thing. Now it sends me to the Create Account (Apple video intro, select a language, and everything) and when I'm done creating the account it sends me again to the start. What can I do?  <answer233040> You will need an original OS X install disc for a computer that old if you can't get it to start up and get to the desktop.  Reinstall the original OS by following a guide such as this. Re-initialize the disc and create a new administrator account.   Then you could use "Software Update" that is built-in to the OS, to update to a newer version of the OS if you like.  Good Luck!   <comment284679> Are you trying to recover data from the original account? <comment284768> @ArchonOSX no, I don't have any important information, I'd reset the Mac but I don't know how to do it..
