Is it possible to keep using iPhoto in parallel with Photos? <body> Is it possible to keep using iPhoto after starting to use Photos?  <answer180969> You can keep using it, but not in parallel.  Any changes made in one app will not be reflected in the other.br Over time, things will diverge more &amp; more.  I would use one &amp; stick to it for now.br When you finally decide to go over to Photos full-time, then do a resync from your current iPhoto state, by deleting the Photos Library &amp; importing again.br Doing that will then erase any work done in Photos &amp; replace it with the latest iPhoto state  <comment215101> I've edited your question to focus on one aspect of the things you were asking.
