Hide Xcode's toolbar in fullscreen mode <body> How can I hide Xcode's toolbar in fullscreen mode (codecmd/code + codectrl/code + codef/code)?  br I tried to hide it and then go into fullscreen but it appeared immediately. Also I tried to hide it using coderight-click/code - codehide toolbar/code but that did not work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsodD.png" alt="disabled option to hide toolbar"  I just would like to have a clear screen with just code on it, w/o any useless toolbars.  Can anyone help me? br Thanks in advance :)  <answer181726> This is not possible. On full screen the toolbar is always visible.  You can hide it only if you are out of full screen mode. If you want to do it with a key combination, you have to assign a shortcut on Preferences â†’ Key Bindings (see the image below).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/geMOq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer204478> Try https://github.com/wczekalski/Distraction-Free-Xcode-plugin, it's a plugin in the making to provide a kind of Zen mode.  <comment216139> Thanks, are you 100% positive? Or is there any hope left for me? :D <comment216140> Sorry, but I'm 100% sure, no way. <comment216141> Ok, thanks then :) <comment248449> Thank you! It's a bit buggy and inconvenient but works somehow :)
