Anki + Latex not working : I have installed BasicTex + dvipng <body> I'm trying to get Anki to work with Latex. Currently, when I open a flashcard with latex on it I get: codeGenerated file: /var/folders/41/v5plvhx12wg0qlrj9h_l0g680000gn/T/anki_temp/tmp.tex Have you installed latex and dvipng?/code  However, I have already installed BasicTex + dvipng. In fact, when I run codewhich latex/code and codewhich dvipng/code on terminal I get: code/Library/TeX/texbin/latex/code and code/Library/TeX/texbin/dvipng/code.  So I need some help. Would anyone know how to make Anki work with Latex? Thanks for your help!  <answer209501> I found the answer here Anki+Latex.   Basically you have to download this Anki add-on, which allows you to edit the path Anki uses to find latex and dvipng. Then you use codewhich latex/code and codewhich dvipng/code (on Mac terminal) to get the full path to each of them, and then you use the add-on to modify Anki's path.  <comment252745> Welcome to Ask Different. Thanks for asking and answering! If you want to help others, consider editing in your OS X version and the versions to the tools you have installed. That really helps people that just need to update things and pins down old posts so that we know when things change or break (again) should they do just that. <comment252861> Thank you for this - this did the trick. <comment272618> Hello, I am in the exact same boat for this question. I have downloaded the add-on but am stuck at that point. When I use \which\ in the terminal, it cannot find TeX or dvipng, even though I see them in the finder. Once I have the path, how do I edit the extension to modify Anki's path? Thank you so much in advance! <comment273069> @cdarwin If you can see it through finder then you have the path (maybe you're typing which in a weird way and it's not working). Now to modify the path in Anki you need to download an Anki plugin called "Edit LaTeX build process"; (just google it and you will find it), it allows you to modify the path to latex, so you just add the path you found there. Hope this helps!
