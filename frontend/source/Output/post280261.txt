iPhone 6 microphone for phone conversations <body> I have Bluetooth enabled hearing aids (Oticon OPN). They pick up the voice of the person I am speaking with. However, I need to keep the phone within a foot or so in order for the person on the phone to hear my voice. Does anyone know of a lavalier type microphone that would pick up my voice for a phone conversation? I have found only mics that can be used for recording - not phone conversations.
