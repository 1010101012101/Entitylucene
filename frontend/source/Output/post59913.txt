Is there a .eml email file viewer that can also save attachments? <body> I'm looking for a free .eml file viewer to emjust/em read email files and for extracting attachments.  I don't want to use Mail.app as it requires account setup - when I click on a .eml file Mail.app opens with a window for setting up an account - which I don't want to do - I never use Mail.app - I use gmail.  Is there a .eml email file viewer (including extracting attachments)?  <answer59955> Look at the FileInfo for EML file: http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/eml.  Sparrow also can open EML file, but not sure if need you to setup an account.  If you just want to view the file, just use Quick Look but cannot save attachment.  <answer62163> There's a free online .eml viewer you can use to extract messages and attachments from .eml, .msg and winmail.dat files: http://www.encryptomatic.com/viewer  <answer75402> To extract attachments from the Terminal, you can use a couple of different methods. Probably the easiest is       perl -MMIME::Base64 -ne 'print decode_base64($_)' &lt; file.eml  out   where codefile.eml/code is the email file in question and codeout/code is the name of the attachment.  The same thing can be accomplished by using the codebase64/code command, but you have to do some cleanup work on the original email file first -- namely strip everything out of the eml file before the base64 encoded attachment. The command would be something along these lines     base64 -D -i file.eml -o out   If you take the 2nd approach, recommend that you operate on a copy of the original file.  Of course for reading the eml files, you can probably use codecat/code or your favorite editor. Works in a pinch, but certainly not the easiest way to deal with email.  <answer225466> MailRaider Pro for Mac OS X does just what I need in terms of being able to open .eml files WITHOUT the need to setup a dummy account or whatever. It just works - I can just open it. I have bought it, it works on El Capitan.  ul liofficial site: http://www.45rpmsoftware.com/mailraider.php/li lion iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mailraider-pro/id765096886?mt=12/li /ul  It also says it handles attachments, but I haven't tried that yet.  <comment69030> +1 thanks @kukoo I will check it out. <comment69035> Can you not set up a dummy email account in Mountain Lion's Mail.app and then untick "enable this account" like you could in Lion and earlier? <comment69038> +1 Good point, I'll see how that goes. <comment88092> This looks like one of the best email clients on any platform. <comment244155> I've found this to be very helpful. It's the simplest and quickest way for me to view the occasional one-off EML email without installing any software. Thank you. <comment273542> Moved accepted answer to MailRaider Pro - this tool covers both requirements in an easier to use App. But thanks for your time and input - your solution is useful as well.
