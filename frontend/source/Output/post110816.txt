How to send an email through an outlook.com alias email address on iOS? <body> strongOutlook.com/strong (past Live Mail / Hotmail) allows creation of email aliases associated to one main account, which is very convenient.  Using strongExchange ActiveSync/strong with an iOS device works really well on all tasks, but one can't send/reply emails using one of those aliases.  Is there any productive way of using these outlook.com aliases on an iOS device?  <answer111663> I haven't found any actual answer for my question, but instead found a very good alternative.  Basically strong@icloud.com/strong accounts also allow the creation of aliases that can be used in all iOS Mail apps, with one particular advantage: the alias allows changing the name of the recipient as well, something strong@outlook.com/strong account aliases does not allow.  You can create strong@icloud.com/strong aliases using the web interface options.
