Rsync not working properly as expected on OS X <body> I'm using rsync on my iMac to backup folders to a remote NAS box. On my NAS box, I have a folder called Backup, and my rsync script should backup to this folder, an example is below:  precodesudo rsync -av --progress -- update --delete  --log-file=/Volumes/Logs/nasbackup_$BACKUP_DATE.log  -e ssh /Volumes/Data /Volumes/NASBackup/Backup /code/pre  So on my NAS I have my root folder Backup. When I run my script, including the above command line, Rsync creates a new folder called Backup on my NAS drive, and starts copying into this folder. It's not recognising that there is already a folder called Backup, and it should be updating and copying files already in my previous Backup folder. Why would Rsync ignore my existing folder, create a brand new folder called Backup and start copying everything, instead of updating/deleting what already in my existing backup folder? Any Suggestions.  <comment94726> If you want the contents of /Volumes/Data/Backup to be copied to /Volumes/NASBackup/Backup, shouldn't you use `sudo rsync ... /Volumes/Data/ /Volumes/NASBackup`? <comment94728> I have done that as well /Volumes/Data/ /Volumes/NASBackup/Backup still creates a brand new folder called Backup rather than using the one that already exists. <comment94736> Where is the new Backup folder being created, precisely? You can't have two folders with the same name. <comment94767> /Volumes/NASBackup/Backup is the existing folder. I'm trying to backup to /Volumes/NASBackup/Backup. /Volumes/NASBackup is my volume, and Backup is a folder on this volume. When I run my script it creates another Backup folder in my /Volumes/NASBackup volume. I really don't understand how it can do this.  When I look at my volume through Finder, it displays another Backup folder.  So rather than my Rsync script simply updating what's in my existing Backup folder, it's going to copy over 750GBs again.  Not good.  When in fact only 20GBs has changed.
