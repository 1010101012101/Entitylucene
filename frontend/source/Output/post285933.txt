Launchd grinding my SSD - 70+ GB/day writes <body> I'm running DiskSensei, which gives me a bunch of metrics on my SSD. My previous SSD had insanely high write amounts after a couple of years, so I just swapped it out.  We're talking about a 250GB SSD which I replaced about a week ago. Fresh, clean, 0 GB written when I started. I've filled about 130 GB of actual data to it, and I just saw DiskSensei reporting upwards of 750 GB "total lifetime writes" today.  Did a completely clean boot, pulled up Activity Monitor, did a reverse sort by the volume of disk writes. The highest process had written 50 megabytes shortly after boot.  Fast-forward to maybe 6 hours later, launchd has written over 25 gigabytes to the disk. I've been doing web browsing and watching some YouTube videos, but nothing that should be resulting in that volume of data.  So....  Anybody have any idea why launchd is writing such a huge volume of data to disk? Is this normal? What, if anything, should I be looking into to get answers?
