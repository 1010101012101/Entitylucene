Can a wired (ethernet) Mac act as a WiFi access point? <body> A MacPro '10 running 10.6.8, connected to the network via Ethernet.   If I'd like to add a webcam is a router required or can I set up direct access? i.e. can AirPort act as an access point?    <answer172265> Yes, you can do that. When Ethernet is connected, go to Sharing System  Preference Pane. You can share the Internet there by selecting Ethernet as a source.
