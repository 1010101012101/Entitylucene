Hackintosh / VMWare AMD 7950 Chipset <body> I currently have a Mac OS X Mavericks VM running on a Windows 7 machine in VMware Workstation.  I am trying to install Logic Studio 9 and  am unable to install due to the following reason.  precodeLogic Studio Installer requires that your system have a Quartz Extreme capable video card. Logic Studio Installer recommends that your system have 64 MB of VRAM; this system has only 0 MB of VRAM. /code/pre  The chipset installed by VMware is:  precodeChipset Model: VMware SVGA II Type: GPU BUS: PCI VRAM: 32MB Device ID: 0x0405 Revision ID: 0x0000 /code/pre  I have a Sapphire 7950 installed on this machine.    What is the best way to approach this problem?  Possible hackintosh solution?  <answer118029> Technically the issue here has nothing to do with the Hackintosh. It's a limit on the VMWare graphics card and failing the Logic install checker.  You can try the following:  ul liInstall Logic9 package, right-click and choose Show Original/li liChoose LogicStudio.mpkg. Right-click and choose Show Package Contents/li liGo to Contents/Resources/Requirements Checker.app/li liRight-click, and choose Show Package Contents/li liFind Checker.app, navigate to Contents/Resources - file minsys.plist/li liEdit it, replacing every "block" with "warn"/li liSave the file./li /ul  Now run the install and it should pass the check.  This same issue impacts genuine Mac's which don't have the required RAM or graphics cards, etc.  <comment137759> This question appears to be off-topic because goes again EULA. <comment137767> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about running OSX on non-Apple hardware <comment137769> Okay I wasn't sure whether it would be or not. Is this a valid superuser question? <comment137770> This is great I will try this.  Would somehow updating the vmware chipset with the correct 7950 actually benefit performance? <comment137771> Btw there seem to be several hackintosh questions on ask different that aren't flagged.
