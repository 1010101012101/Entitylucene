Ping all IPs in LAN <body> How would I find out all the devices on my LAN by pinging them all in terminal? What would the code be?  <answer19851> Probably the easiest way to do this is to use a command line utility called nmap. You can download the binaries from the main site. Alternatively, if you have Homebrew installed, you can use that to install nmap from a terminal by typing codebrew install nmap/code  Once you have downloaded and installed nmap, you need one other piece of information about your LAN - what block of IP address are used for machines on it. The easiest way to find that out is to run codeifconfig -a inet/code from a terminal. When you type that in, either your strongen0/strong or strongen1/strong network interface should have an stronginet/strong entry (ignore the inet address for stronglo0/strong). It's the IP address next to that you're interested in. Here is an  example output from my machine:  precode$ ifconfig -a inet lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384     options=3&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM&gt;     inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000 gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=27&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,TSO4&gt; en1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     inet 192.168.0.6 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255 p2p0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2304 fw0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 4078 /code/pre  On my network, my machine has the address 192.168.0.6 on interface strongen1/strong.  strongNOTE/strong: depending on how many machines you have on your network, pinging them all could take a very very long time. In the following examples, I'll assume you have less than 256 devices on your network and that they are all in the same subnet - likely to be the case if this is a home network.  If your stronginet/strong looks like 192.168.emN.N/em (where each emN/em is a number between 0-255) then the following command will try to ping addresses 192.168.emN/em.0 to 192.168.emN/em.255 on your network, and report any machines which respond (you need to use sudo so that nmap can use ICMP pings). Fill in the emN/em sections with the matching number in your stronginet/strong address:  precodesudo nmap -sn -PE 192.168.N.0/24 /code/pre  For example, if your stronginet/strong address was reported as 192.168.1.100, you should type: codesudo nmap -sn -PE 192.168.1.0/24/code  If your stronginet/strong address looks like 10.emN.N.N/em, use this, again filling in the emN/em sections with your own reported numbers:  precodesudo nmap -sn -PE 10.N.N.0/24 /code/pre  And finally, if it looks like 172.emN.N.N/em, use this:  precodesudo nmap -sn -PE 172.N.N.0/24 /code/pre  h1Searching Larger Networks/h1  If you want to expand your search to include more machines, you have to adjust the number after the slash in the address section for the command. In the three commands above, I've specified code/24/code. That means nmap will use the first 24 bits of the IP address you've specified and automatically generate the other numbers (in the first example nmap uses 192.168.emN/em as the exact part, as each group is 8 bits). So to search more addresses emdecrease/em the number after the slash. code/24/code will search 256 address, code/23/code will search 512 address, code/22/code will search 1024.  Every time you decrease the number by 1, twice as many addresses are searched - this is why decreasing it too much can make the search take a very very long time. For example, to search all 192.168.emN.N/em addresses, you would specify code192.168.0.0/16/code - but that will have to ping strong65536/strong machines. Assuming 0.25 pings per second, that would take 4 hours to complete...  I don't actually know how many pings per second nmap can send, but if you try a full scan, you may have to leave it overnight, or at least have a long coffee.  h1Those nmap Options/h1  Just so you know, here's what the other nmap options I specified mean:  precode-sn (No port scan)  -PE (ICMP ping echo) /code/pre  As the "no port scan" option may hint at, you can do all sorts of very funky things with nmap, such as checking to see what ports are open on a machine (to tell what services they are probably running) and it can even guess which OS the target machine is running with a pretty decent degree of accuracy. If you need more advanced things like that, check the nmap docs. I'd link to them, but I'm not renowned enough to post more than 2 links yet.  <answer29779> Or ping the broadcast address    precodeping -c 3 192.168.1.255 | grep 'bytes from' | awk '{ print $4 }' | sort | uniq /code/pre  <answer29783> If everything is turned on, responsive and in one subnet then something like 'ping 192.168.1' for a few seconds followed by 'arp -a' should give you a list of all the devices with ip address and MAC address.  <comment21797> See my answer to this question, specifically #3 and #4: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19783/how-do-i-know-the-ip-addresses-of-other-computers-in-my-network/19784#19784
