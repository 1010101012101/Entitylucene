Restart OS X GUI <body> I need to restart the WindowServer (OS X's GUI); I know this can be achieved using the command codesudo killall -HUP WindowServer/code  but this closes all your open applications. Is there a way to restart the WindowsServer without it quitting all your open applications?  <answer24804> The WindowServer is responsible for drawing all Windows and Windows Content for all Programs (incl. Finder), so it would not be possible to kill the Process without killing all Applications.  You can read about the Window Server in the Apple Technical Note TN2083 for OSX 10.5.  Even though it is announced in that Document that Apple plans to change the Behaviour in future Systemversions, it's in your list of required OS's.  <answer24989> There is no way to restart window server without closing all apps; logging out &amp; then back in is the best option  <answer208172> You can also try:  precodekillall -KILL Dock /code/pre  <answer236780> precodekillall Finder         # what should work killall SystemUIServer # what to run in addition if it does not /code/pre  If any of the three do not restart (finder sometimes does not automatically reboot in my experience), then run these commands after the initial set:  precodeopen -a Finder open -a SystemUIServer /code/pre  This set of commands (specifically codekillall Finder/code) is almost exactly like codetaskkill /IM explorer.exe/code within the MS-DOS command line.  <comment27884> What OS version are you running? <comment27885> I need it to work on 10.5, 10.6 & 10.7 <comment27911> Why do you want to kill the Window Server that couldn't be sufficed with a logout/login (or for that matter restart)? <comment27916> I'm writing a program and you can't rely on the user to logout/in <comment27937> I think the note about removing it is referring to the fact that the window server is available from the global bootstrap namespace, not removing the entire window server. <comment27939> Then force the logout - that you can do - or look at kiosk mode <comment27966> logging out still quits all your running applications <comment123517> It is ludicrous that that Apple doesent provide a way to do this.  Many times my UI on multiple monitors gets a little confused and a restart would fix it.  even MICROSOFT provides this via 'net stop uxsms & net start uxsms'    why can't APPLE manage to do this? <comment159597> Much related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103610/what-does-hup-do-when-used-with-killall - also, [I've been using `killall`](http://superuser.com/a/269711/28411) since before this question with no problems. It kills `WindowServer` only, and nothing else. But I use it with default `TERM` sign, which means simply write it without `-HUD`. <comment251094> Does killing the Dock restart the WindowServer? <comment251097> @patrix It restarts some parts of the UI interface (not sure which). In my case, the top bar was not displaying (time, clock, sound and wifi were invisible...). Restarting the dock fixed the problem. <comment251098> Fair point, but how does this relate to the problem described in the question? <comment251099> @patrix It's a way to restart parts of the UI **without quitting all your open applications**. That might help the OP. <comment289849> Do applications remain open if one does this? <comment289851> Yes, they absolutely do. <comment364293> This works quite well when needing to restart the crashed Video portion of the Mac OS X GUI, which was preventing a login via VNC / Mac Remote Desktop.  I could still login via SSH, issue the `killall -KILL Dock` command and have the majority of the apps remain functional and the user still logged in.  At the same time, VNC remote access was restored.  Thank you sir!
