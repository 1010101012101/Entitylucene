lost pictures while transferring them to pc <body> I was transferring pictures with copy-paste straight from my iphone to my pc when the pc gave me a BSOD and restarted. The folder I had created on the desktop disappeared and the photos were no longer on the iphone either. How can I retrieve them? Are they hanging somewhere on my pc or iphone? Thanks in advance!  <comment324544> Which program did you use to transfer the pictures with? (i.e. which program provided the copy-paste feature)
