How can I get the Parallels Desktop Application Icons in Launchpad? <body> I have the opposite problem of this one; I have Parallels Desktop 6 installed and while I do have the Applications folder in the dock, I don't have links to any of these applications in Launchpad.  How can I get these application icons in Launchpad? I'm aware that Parallels has the following knowledge base article which says that there is going to be a folder in Launchpad, but that's not what I want. I'm looking for a way to get all the applications icon to be visible in Launchpad, similar to this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hk8qI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note: I had Parallels installed on Snow Leopard (before I had Launchpad), and now I am using Lion.  <answer45147> To add an application to Launchpad, you can simply drag it to Launchpad in the Dock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pMag1.png" alt=""  But be careful â€” currently there's no way to emremove/em something from Launchpad that you've added.  (And if you have items in a folder in Launchpad, you can easily drag them out and organize them as you wish.)
