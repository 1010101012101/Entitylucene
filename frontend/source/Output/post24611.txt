Cannot compile C code after installing xcode <body> When I installed Xcode on Snow Leopard, codegcc/code was not in my path. I manually added code/Developer/bin/code to get gcc. However, I wrote a simple C program to include codestdlib.h/code and codestdio.h/code and print a string, but I get linker errors.   I think this is because I don't have my include path configured. Can anyone tell me why this was not done automatically and how I can get my C compiler set up?  <answer24612> I think there was a bug in Xcode 4.1 where the command line tools were emnot/em installed. I just ran the 4.1.1 delta installer from the App Store and things work just fine.  precodeLast login: Tue Sep 20 14:47:44 on ttys001 mac:~ mike$ which gcc /usr/bin/gcc mac:~ mike$ ls -l /usr/bin/gcc lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  12 Sep 19 16:04 /usr/bin/gcc -&gt; llvm-gcc-4.2 mac:~ mike$ echo $PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin mac:~ mike$ mkdir /tmp/test mac:~ mike$ cat &gt; /tmp/test/hello.c &lt;&lt; EOF /* Hello World program */  #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;  main() {     printf("Hello World");  } EOF mac:~ mike$ cd /tmp/test mac:test mike$ gcc hello.c -o hello mac:test mike$ ./hello  Hello Worldmac:test mike$  /code/pre  This should work out of the box with the latest Xcode. Have you made sure you are using the latest gcc / Xcode and not having previous path or binaries installed?  <answer25571> Without knowing the build errors, you either are missing a tool or have header issues. In the case of the latter, here is how llvm-gcc issues in geos were overcome: http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/463.  <comment28981> I too had macs with Xcode 4.1 where the path didn't include gcc. Cleaning the old path changes and old binaries let the latest installer fix things to run "out of the box" <comment29031> For what it's worth I ended up just reformatting hahahah!  It would appear the company computer I've inherited was not a clean install (I was told it was), so my solution is to just whipe it out... oh well! <comment29032> I too have taken to clean wiping more and more of my "Lion" upgrades.
