Menu option "Select startup disk on desktop" greyed out when Finder window is active <body> Previous OS X versions allowed one to select the startup disk using Cmd-Shift-Up when on the Desktop, or "from" any Finder window. In 10.9.4 this works only from the Desktop. When a Finder window is active, the menu item does appear when holding down Shift, but is greyed out.br The startup disk emis/em visible on the Desktop, per Finder preferences.br Any ideas? I can make a workaround using Keyboard Maestro or the likes, but..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PUpgL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer166609> I created a workaround using KeyboardMaestro: only in Finder, on hotkey (⌘⇧↑), execute AppleScript:  precodetell application "Finder"     select window of desktop     set selection to item 1 of desktop end tell /code/pre  Weirdly enough it doesn't emshow/em that it is selected, but Cmd-down opens its window.  <comment194866> Is your startup disk icon visible on the desktop already?  If not, that might explain why the option is grayed out. <comment194867> The startup disk is visible (per Finder preferences), I'll update the description. <comment194873> Ok. I figured it was worth a shot... Sorry that I don't have any other ideas. <comment194878> No problem :-) Thanks for the feedback. <comment195264> @BartArondson Done!
