Recent Calls Do Not Show Up <body> When I answered a recent call the name and number populated.  After the call I wanted to add them as a contact and cannot find the call.  I've looked at "Recent" and it is not there.  The only options I have are "all" and "missed" but both are empty for this caller.  Where can I find this information?  It was only minutes ago!  My phone is still using ios 7.1.2
