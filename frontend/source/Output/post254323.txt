macOS focus rings <body> Lately on macOS (10.11 and 10.12) I have been noticing controls showing the focus ring which I can't recall seeing before. I am used to seeing the focus ring show on text fields, but not all buttons. For example, even the segmented control in Notification Center shows focus rings.   This has only started happening recently. Is this normal now?  <comment316585> That's keyboard access in assistive technologies in system preferences. <comment316589> Thank you! I must have accidentally turned this on by pressing Control+F7!
