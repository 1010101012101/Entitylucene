Purge contacts information on Mac <body> Last month, for a temporary event, I've added a Polish number (+48 prefix) to 800 of my regular contacts using a vCard file.   Now, this event is finished and now I'd like to remove all those temporary polish numbers from my contacts and keep all other information intact.  Is there a way to easily do that, for example, using an Automator action?  <answer247934> I've deleted my original answer because I initially misunderstood how the code+48/code numbers were added, sorry about that.  Instead of using AppleScript, I'm going to offer you a different solution because while I could and did modify the original AppleScript emcode/em to delete the entire number that had a code+48/code prefix, nonetheless there were errors that stopped the emscript/em from executing completely during the testing phase. So I'm opting for a different solution over debugging the AppleScript emcode/em.  This solution requires exporting the entire contents of the Contacts.app to a vCard file (.vcf), modifying it using a RegEx in codesed/code, and then importing the modified vCard file (.vcf) back into Contacts. Note that this method will replace all existing contacts with the updated new emallcontacts.vcf/em file and should not be an issue as it's really only removing the information you stated you wanted removed, just in a roundabout way.  NOTE: These directions were tested under OS X 10.11.5 with the Contacts.app using its emdefault/em preferences.  ul liOpen Contacts./li liBackup Contacts, click: File  Export  Contacts Archive…/li /ul  Now that Contacts have been backed up, do the following...  ul liSelect the first contact and then press kbdcommand/kbdkbdA/kbd to select all contacts./li liClick: File  Export  Export vCard…/li liIn the Save As dialog box it will show as, emthe name of the first contact and n others/em, br change it to: emallcontacts/em/li liCopy and paste the following emcommand/em into Terminal, then press the Space bar to add a emspace/em afterwards.  codesed -i.bak -E '/^TEL.*\+48.*$/d'/code/li liFrom Finder, drag and drop the emallcontacts.vcf/em file onto the Terminal window. Note that in Finder, the em.vcf/em extension may be hidden and it will show in Terminal./li /ul  Example: codesed -i.bak -E '/^TEL.*\+48.*$/d' /Users/me/Documents/allcontacts.vcf/code  ul liNow press kbdenter/kbd to modify the emallcontacts.vcf/em file. A backup of the original is created as: emallcontacts.vcf.bak/em/li /ul  Now import the updated emallcontacts.vcf/em file into Contacts.  ul liFile  Import and select the emallcontacts.vcf/em file, then click Open./li liOn the "Are you sure you want to import n cards?" emsheet/em click: Review Duplicates…/li liOn the ensuing emsheet/em select Keep New and check the Apply to All checkbox then click Import./li /ul  The Contacts telephone entries containing numbers with a code+48/code prefix have been removed.  hr  The target lines in the emallcontacts.vcf/em file will have the following pattern and note the example below is not the only way it can present and thus the need to use a RegEx aside from the phone numbers themselves being different as the emvalue/em for codetype=/code can vary too.  Example line in the vCard file: codeTEL;type=CELL;type=VOICE:+48 697 107 394/code  The RegEx is: code^TEL.*\+48.*$/code  Explanation:  ul li^ assert position at start of the string./li liTEL matches the characters TEL literally (case sensitive)./li li.* matches any character (except newline). Quantifier: * Between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed [greedy]./li li\+ matches the character + literally./li li48 matches the characters 48 literally./li li.* matches any character (except newline). Quantifier: * Between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed [greedy]./li li$ assert position at end of the string./li /ul  So, the codesed/code emcommand/em, codesed -i.bak -E '/^TEL.*\+48.*$/d' file/code backups the emfile/em (code-i.bak/code) and deletes any line starting with codeTEL/code that contains code+48/code. Which based on how lines are stored in the vCard will just remove the lines needed to accomplish the task as lines starting with codeTEL/code that have code+48/code in them can only be the lines you want removed.  strongNOTE:/strong The also assumes you did not previously have any numbers with the code+48/code prefix before you updated your Contacts with the original vCard file that contained the numbers with the code+48/code prefix.  <comment305486> You say you used a vCard to add the "+48 prefix" to the numbers. Can you show an example of a number from the vCard that had been modified?  Does it look like `+481234567890` or _what_ in the vCard? <comment305944> Numbers are like +48 697 107 394 <comment307731> I think we're almost there. In fact, I don't want just to remove the `+48` prefix but the entire number. I just want to purge the +48 numbers from my contacts. <comment308124> @LuCouto, Finally had some time to look back and have updated my answer with a method that while not AppleScript nonetheless it will work. <comment308238> Those instructions are very clear and they've worked great! Thanks a lot!
