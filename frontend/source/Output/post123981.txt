Add MP3 Files To Native Music Player? <body> I use Linux on the desktop and have zero access to iTunes. I'm in a position where I have to use an iPhone for a while.   I can plug my phone to my computer and mount the storage drive. Where would I dip my MP3 collection in order to pay them in the native application?   It's an iPhone 4S updated to the latest version of iOS.   <answer123982> afaik since iOS 5 there is no longer a Linux Application that supports syncing Music to an iPhone (there used to be GTKpod)  The easiest would be to install WINE and then iTunes I suppose.  <comment144851> There's no place I can just drop my MP3 files on the phone, then let the music app scan? ...like every other phone? <comment144854> No, the music app can't scan for files. It's made to be used in conjunction with iTunes
