curl installed but ec2 api could not find <body> I am trying to get the ec2 command-line api work on my OS X 10.7.4 without much success. The commands are complaining about curl but it looks like curl is installed and is available. See below:  precode[$:local] ec2din sanity-check:  Problems accessing AWS.  Is curl installed? [$:local] curl curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information [$:local] which curl curl is /opt/local/bin/curl curl is /usr/bin/curl curl is /opt/local/bin/curl [$:local] ec2din --debug --debug: mispelled meta parameter? [$:local] ec2din -debug -e: mispelled meta parameter? [$:local] ec2dim --debug --debug: mispelled meta parameter? /code/pre  Any help is appreciated.  PS: I am using iTerm2.  <comment78037> Do you have the environment variables EC2_CERT, EC2_PRIVATE_KEY and EC2_HOME defined? <comment78057> yes, they are all defined. I have a similar setup working on a ubuntu machine. Just not working on my mac laptop. <comment78116> Can you add the output of `ec2din --debug` to your question? <comment78135> Ok, added some debug commands to the question. Not sure if they'll help. <comment78136> Yea, not helpful. :) Where'd you get the ec2 commands from? Homebrew? Are you running the latest version? `brew info ec2-api-tools` will show you what you have and what the latest is if you installed with Homebrew. <comment78154> I checked my system and it looks like I have ec2 tools coming from two sources: ~/.ec2/bin and /usr/bin. Also in /usr/bin ec2* are symlinks to aws tools. Any clue how do I remove them? Additionally, I noticed some environment variables being set without me setting them explicitly in .bashrc or .bash_profile, such as EC2_URL. How do I unset them? Thanks.
