Does a black screen save battery on a macbook? <body> I've seen some similar questions about iPhone on this site, but none of them focus on macbook, so here comes this one.  The picture below is a screenshot of my current desktop, with menu bar and dock hidden, as well as grey scale turned on.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uJPMi.png" alt="enter image description here"  My question is:   ol liCan doing so save some energy on a macbook?/li liApproximately how much energy can be saved?/li liConversely, what if I have a plain white(#FFFFFF) desktop picture?/li /ol  <answer247170> No. No battery will be saved regardless of what color your screen is. This only applies when the screen is OLED, like in the Apple Watch.   You can save battery by lowering the screen brightness, though.  <answer272296> No battery will be saved regardless of what color your screen is - agreed. however, personally, although, I prefer white text on black background, I feel more comfortable at lower brightness with black text on white background
