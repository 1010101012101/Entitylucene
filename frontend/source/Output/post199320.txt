Problems with VPN: OS X devices can connect, iOS-devices can not <body> I got a little problem: I configured OS X server to provide VPN to OD-users. The VPN-settings are being pushed through profile manager. Now comes the strange thing:  It doesn't matter if I'm in my own network or in a foreign network: My OS X-devices (Macbook, iMac) are able to connect to VPN - my iOS-devices are not. iOS-devices get an message like "VPN server does not respond".  When my OS X device is connected to VPN I can reach all servers in the local network, but not servers outside this network like google.com.  A trace route looks like this:  traceroute to google.com (173.194.44.64), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets  1  buero.mydomain.com (192.168.10.10)  51.080 ms  50.838 ms  51.211 ms  2  * * *  3  * * *  OS X server is behind an AVM fritzbox with the following settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9PDL.png" alt="Fritzbox-Settings"  What can I do here?  <comment239912> It seems like your DNS servers might be configured incorrectly. 192.168.10.10 Are you sure that's correct, doesn't seem like to me. Try 8.8.8.8, or 8.8.4.4 that's google's public servers. Though you might be giving up some privacy, but you'll know what the culprit is. <comment239915> 192.168.10.10 is the OS X server which provides primary-zone for bureau.example.com .  But the really fancy stuff is: Using L2TP only it works now, but ONLY if passphrase of OD-user and shared secret are the same.
