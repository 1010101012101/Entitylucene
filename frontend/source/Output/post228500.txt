enable dictionaries in dictionary app under el capitan <body> os x el capitan, new mac book air with fresh os x installation.  In dictionary app preferences, no foreign language dictionaries appear in the the list of available dictionaries.   However, in /Library/Dictionaries there are many available dictionaries.   How can I access these dictionaries?  <answer228525> Go to codeDictionary &gt; Preferences/code. That will bring up a window like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PwuDV.png" alt="Dictionary preferences pane"  Then, check them off and they will appear on the Dictionary front-page.  <answer228554> This was silly.  I just had to resize the preferences window to reveal the other dictionaries!  <comment278634> Try setting up a new user account and see if you have the same problem when logged into that.  If not, sounds like a broken .plist in Home/Library/Preferences or something similar <comment278668> I see only the first 4 entries in Dictionary- preferences.   I cannot find any com.apple.Dictionary.plist file on my system at all. <comment300841> This. I can't believe I just lost 45 minutes to this.
