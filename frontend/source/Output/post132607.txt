How to save only the "configuration" of an iPod for later restore? <body> My iPod Classic 160GB is formatted "Windows" (presumably FAT32).  I want to "Macintosh" format it (hfs+).  Is there a way to save only the "configuration" of said iPod so I can more-easily restore it such that I don't have to perform a full backupof it's ~150GB of data?  And if not, will the full backup even work with this format change?
