Check which programs are using your camera through terminal <body> I'm using the following command to check which processes/programs are connecting (sending data online) and the open ports. Is it possible for me to check which of these applications are sending/using the camera or audio input?      sudo lsof -i -P | grep -i "Established"   For example, is there a difference in the values returned for Skype before it uses the camera and during the time it uses the camera? Is there a way I can distinguish?  Otherwise, is it possible to tell if the camera is in use through other commands or even in xCode (is there a function or something I can use)?
