How to make non-editable non-savable PDF into editable and savable? <body> My university provides forms such as here in non-editable and non-savable form (it also has some odd sign such as 'Print form' that I need to remove). I am able to print the document with Illustrator and edit it this way even without the em'Print form'/em but if I print it through browser, it has this odd sign em'Print form'/em. I don't want to rewrite things again-and-again. Is it possible to make the PDF so that people without Illustrator were able to edit and save it?  ol liIs there a way to make the PDF editable and savable in OS X?/li liIs the only way do it with Adobe Illustrator?/li /ol  <answer92042> Preview in Mountain Lion allows you to inform all the fields available in that form. If you need to actually remove fields, you can use Infix to convert it to a standard PDF.  I just tried on the link you gave and it worked perfectly.  <comment108046> What is Infix? I tested the preview in Mountain Lion and I am able to save and edit -- but I am not able to remove the *'Print form'* thing and the title gets under the form. <comment108116> Infix is PDF editor created by Inceni.
