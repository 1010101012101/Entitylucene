How can I extract contacts from an iTunes backup of an iPhone? <body> I have an iTunes backup of an iPhone, and I want to extract the contacts from there as a file, e.g., vcf or csv.  There are many advertised paid software packages. strongIs there any free option?/strong  <answer275458> I use an app called iExplorer for this. I hear an app called PhoneView(?) does it as well, but I have never used it. You still need the encryption password though, there's no simple way to crack that nut.   <answer275529> Decipher Backup Browser exports the contacts to VCF from an iTunes backup file. It is of course paid, like the other options people are suggesting in the responses, though.  <answer277567> Well, you can use this simple script I made half a year ago, but decided to publish when saw your question.  It renames all files to their normal names. After that you can find AddressBook in codeHomeDomain/Library/AddressBook/AddressBook.sqlitedb/code  It's not CSV, but quick look through it show that you should take a "person" from codeABPerson/code table (codeROWID/code, codeFirst/code and codeLast/code are the most interesting).br After that you look up persons in codeABMultiValue/code table: codeROWID/code acquired in previous step links to coderecord_id/code, codevalue/code has the actual value, and codelabel/code seems to be really weird for me. I'd recommend you to take all values looking as numbers.  Hope you have some programming skills or know someone who can help you.br If not, I could look into making some kind of helper script for it, but can't promise anything.br Those shitty paid apps always made me angry, and I can't understand why is there no FOSS apps for recovering data from iTunes backups. Meh.  <answer286563> There is no difficulty,from iTunes Backup to recover iPhone contacts ,  ol liOpen iTunes.
