Apple Numbers: how to change a date format to a number format <body> In Apple Numbers the app can work out the number of days between dates, but then if I times this by a number (ie, a %interest rate and an amount of money) Numbers insists that the answer is a number of days!  Even if I go to CellDate Format and change it.  The system ignores this and returns to displaying the answer as a number of days.  How do I force the system to show this cell as a number and not in the date / days format?  <answer151743> You can use a function to convert the duration to a plain number.  For example, if difference between the dates in in E4, and it's 10 days, then...  precode=DUR2HOURS(E4) Ã— 0.1 /code/pre  Shows a number, 24.0. There are other functions that you might use: codeDUR2DAYS/code, etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/02eOl.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/StrEU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer215357> precode=STRIPDURATION(your_current_forumula_resulting_in_days)*your_calculation_based_on_those_days /code/pre  codeSTRIPDURATION(duration-calculation)/code will give a number (of days), which you can then for a calculation.
