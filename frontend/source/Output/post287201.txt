Shortcut to move one screen to the right/left in Excel <body> The official docs say to use codeOption-Up/Down/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5S2ol.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried that - as well as codeOption-Left/Right/code and codeCommand-(any arrow keys)/code and they all do different things than the page right/left.  So is there any way to get this functionality short of point and click?  strongUpdate/strong By playing around a bit more an answer was discovered:  the codeCommand-Left|Right Arrow/code will page left/right strongemto the next non-empty cell/em/strong. I had been seeing it page to the beginning/end since the particular rows had few entries.  strongemHold on ../em/strong  So the behavior is that the `Command-Left|Right Arrow will move to the next non-empty cell emif there were other intervening empty cells/em.  So in the case of a row with all entries filled - e.g. the Header Row - a single invocation puts you at beginning/end of the ementire/em row: so in emthat/em case it behaves like Row Home/Row End.    This is not acceptable behavior: is there any workaround?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qm1pc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer287234> Although it seems counter intuitive not to use the left/right arrows, (that is a subject for giving Microsoft some feedback) using the following key combinations work for strongExcel 15.xx for Mac:/strong  hr  h3Using Built-in MacBook Keyboard:/h3  Page Right: kbdfn/kbd+kbd⌥ option/kbd+kbd↓ down arrow/kbdbr Page Left: kbdfn/kbd+kbd⌥ option/kbd+kbd↑ up arrow/kbd  h3Using External Apple Wired Keyboard:/h3  Page Right: kbd⌥ option/kbd+kbdpage down/kbdbr Page Left: kbd⌥ option/kbd+kbdpage up/kbd  hr  As noted in the OP's screenshot.  <comment362570> Just to be sure, are you pressing the fn key along with the combo as per your screen shot? <comment362571> @bjbk I tried with `fn` as well .. no difference. in any case that would be a problem given I use an external keyboard often as not. <comment362572> Ok, one more question: which version of Excel? <comment362573> @bjbk updated OP <comment362575> Thanks.  I can't seem to duplicate your issue, sorry.  FN + OPTION + UP ARROW / DOWN ARROW work as expected on both external and internal keyboard.  Your screenshot does not say to use right of left arrow unless I'm missing something.  Hope you find a solution. Cheers! <comment362576> @bjbk  Oh wait.. this last time around i was trying `left|right arrow` not `up|down` - which are major non intuitive for doing left-right.  With `fn` those do work for me. Pls make this an answer.
