Can only one partition of old hard drive been transferred to new MacBook? <body> I just took the hard drive out of my MacBook pro that broke down a few days ago and put it into an enclosure. My questions; If I buy a new MacBook pro, is it possible to ONLY transfer the  codeMacintosh HD partition/code  from the enclosure onto the new MacBook pro, WITHOUT transferring the codeBootcamp partition/code  as well?  Thanks for your help!  <answer150514> I have not look at this related to Bootcamp in a few years, but I my searches indicate this has not changed.   Apple's Migration Assistant will only look for attached Mac OS X system volumes to migrate. It will not migrate Bootcamp partitions or other data on non-boot volumes.
