Shutdown warning every time I log on <body> Whenever I log on, I get the "Your computer crashed previously, do you want to restart the running programs?" error; regardless of whether my machine crashed or not. Whether I press OK or Cancel, it comes back the next day.  While my machine crashes quite regularly, it usually shuts down cleanly. Presumably, therefore, this error is flagged via some stuck setting.  How do I "unstick" it?  hr  strongEDIT/strong The actual error message:     strongYou shut down your computer because of a problem./strong      If you want to open the applications that were open when you shut   down, click Open.      If you do nothing, the computer will continue the login in [countdown]   seconds.   I don't know what to look for in the logs, but I can isolate the time down to the nearest minute and this is what I get (hopefully this doesn't expose any compromising data!):  precode06/07/2015 10:00:54.477 am com.apple.launchd.peruser.15022[322]: Background: Aqua: Registering new GUI session. 06/07/2015 10:00:54.503 am com.apple.launchd.peruser.15022[322]: (com.apple.EscrowSecurityAlert) Unknown key: seatbelt-profiles 06/07/2015 10:00:54.504 am com.apple.launchd.peruser.15022[322]: (com.apple.ReportCrash) Falling back to default Mach exception handler.

If the opton is grayed out, use Recovery HD or Internet Recovery. And perhaps reset PRAM ( **Command** + **Option** + **P** + **R** ) on boot and wait for the chime to play the 2nd time <comment231644> Clearing PRAM is no cure for everything. <comment231655> Repair Disk on Macintosh HD was disabled, but not on its parent device; it didn't achieve anything. Neither did resetting the PRAM. It's a managed machine -- I was just hoping for an easy fix -- so I'll see what my service people say. <comment231662> What does the log say when you start the computer? <comment232259> @TheBro21 I misread your comment. I have now updated the question with the log output during the time in which the error occurs. <comment232291> Are you using any third party kernel extensions? Also try repairing permissions <comment232316> I don't know about kernel extensions. Repairing permissions didn't make a difference.
