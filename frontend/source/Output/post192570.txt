Mac OS is reporting bad free space <body> I have a MacBook Pro since 2014 and I haven't had any problem in these months. But today I realized that the free space info that gives Mac is wrong. I add two captures, one from the hard disk info, and the second from the 'About this Mac' window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ORoOk.png" alt="first capture"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MMLoT.png" alt="second capture"  As you can see, I have set my Mac to Spanish language; hope you have no problem to understand it ;) Also, in the second capture, it says there are about 312 GB of apps, when there is no such amount of apps in my laptop. Even more, if you add 312 + the free space Mac says there is (about 350 GB), it results more than 500GB!  Why is happening this? Is there a bad update from Mac that is causing this?  Thank you for your replies!  <answer192612> The Storage tab of About This Mac is based on Spotlight, so try reindexing the HD:  HT201716 - Spotlight: How to re-index folders or volumes  <comment229188> That is indeed strange. What version of OS X are you running? Have you tried booting from the recovery partition and checking the hard drive? <comment229191> There is a app that is wrongly reporting. Look at them one by one to find out who is it <comment229240> Short answer is, the meter in the About This Mac window is wrong. See [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/189083). <comment229241> And [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/150561)...I feel like there's more but I can't find them at the moment. <comment229257> Try rebuilding the Spotlight index and then restart the computer to see if that solves anything (https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201716). <comment229312> Try Onyx ... It is a good one for maintenance repairs. You could also shut it down, fire it back up and hold command + R which will take you to recovery. Then click on disk utility/macintosh HD, repair, then in the bottom right click on verify disk and see if anything comes about in red. If something does then click repair disk <comment229346> Thank you all for your replies! Just reindexing my HD via the posts you gave me (Spotlight was the key) made my storage tab looks fine ;)
