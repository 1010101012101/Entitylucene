Install Lion partition on the latest iMac <body> I tried to create 3 partitions, one for the current OSX Mavericks, one for Lion and one for the installation dmg, but it seems that the Fusion drive doesn't allow me to create more than 2 partitions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YB6ss.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can't burn a DVD, I don't have disc drive, I would like to know how can I install Lion on a partition on my mac, and keep using the main partition with Mavericks.  thanks  <comment141871> To cut short your tries. You won't be able to install Lion on a new iMac. Other suggestion, why create a partition instead of using USB pendrive ? <comment141872> Ok, now I'm using a USB pen drive, I've restored the Lion InstallESD.dmg on the USB pen, and run it at startup. <comment141873> @MatthieuRiegler However, when I select I get a blank screen with a ban icon. Is because it can't run on the new iMac? <comment141878> Indeed. When new Macs are released they will only run with the currently shipping version of Mac O/S and NOT previous ones. There may be hacks out there to let you run previous versions but I am unsure how well they work. If you really NEED an older version of Mac O/S you may need to pick up a used Mini or some such and install it there.
