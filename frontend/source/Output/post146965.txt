How to enable cut action (and shortcut)? <body> I am using currently Mac OSX v. 10.9.5 and not being able to cut files or folders is the most stupid thing I have seen in an Operating System, with all respect for this nice OS.   Is there a possibility to enable this shortcut or action?  <answer146966> Things are "Different" on Mac. There's only strongCopy/strong action. Hovewer if You want strongCut/strong feature, instead of strongPaste/strong You'll need to strongMove/strong the item with shortcut kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⌥ ALT/kbd+kbdv/kbd.  <comment173224> Ok, it does what I wanted so thank you ;)
