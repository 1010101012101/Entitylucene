Two iPhone 4S Configured with same email ID <body> I had a iPhone 4S which was setup with a Gmail ID and later I returned it to my employer, since it was given by them. I have a new personal iPhone configured with same email id.  When my employer tries to configure old phone for somebody else, they face an issue that device is mapped to my Gmail ID. They are unable to configure it for new person.  What can be done to resolve issue?  <answer194875> In your former iPhone:  ol liTap Settings  iCloud. Scroll down and tap Sign Out.
