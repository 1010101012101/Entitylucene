GRUB 2 - "fb: swiutching to radeondrmfb from EFI VGA" <body> Whenever I try to boot Arch, Mint or Debian from a USB stick using GRUB 2 on my mac with compatibility mode, it freezes on this error (given in the question title).  I've tried every available, up to date, method on the web.  Any help is appreciated.  I have managed to get into the GRUB 2 commandline. Is there an option to set or something?  <answer222003> There seems to be a problem with the radeon driver when booting. You can test a fix by doing this:  ol liWhen you see the grub menu, press 'e', which will allow you to edit the entry./li liGo to the line with "linux...." and look for where it says 'ro'./li liAfter the 'ro', add 'nomodeset' (without quotes), and then boot (press F10)./li /ol  If that works, you can make it permanent by editing your /etc/default/grub file, and changing the line to look like this:  precodeGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="nomodeset" /code/pre  Then run:  precodesudo update-grub /code/pre  This isn't the best solution, since it seems to put your machine into software rendering. I'm hunting for a proper fix.  <answer257014> Once in GRUB press the e key. We’re now going to disable the AMD graphics card while we boot into the Ubuntu Live CD. Look for the line set gfxpayload=keep. Once you’ve found it, type the following lines underneath to disable the AMD graphics card:  precodeoutb 0x728 1 outb 0x710 2 outb 0x740 2 outb 0x750 0 /code/pre  Next find the kernel line and after “quiet splash” , add the following  precodei915.lvds_channel_mode=2 i915.modeset=1 i915.lvds_use_ssc=0 /code/pre  Source: https://orville.thebennettproject.com/articles/installing-ubuntu-14-04-lts-on-a-2011-macbook-pro/  <comment255017> Why do you need grub on mac ? You can easily choose a startup disk by hitting alt + option when the mac is starting. Check : https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/ this tool is easy to use and makes good usb linux for mac. <comment255018> Well, I just downloaded the Linux Mint ISO file and burned it to the flash drive - GRUB 2 is what comes up with the boot options after I boot from the EFI menu. Thanks for the link - I have seen it before but cannot use it as my OSX bluescreens on boot, even before the "ALT+R" gets a chance. <comment309743> life saver!! thanks mate. Let me know if you find a proper fix <comment333067> Had the same problem with OpenSUSE on non-mac hardware, this also worked for me except that instead of `update-grub` I had to run `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`
