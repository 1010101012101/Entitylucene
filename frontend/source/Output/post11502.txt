building wine on mac <body> I'm not really a big fan of macports or any package manager that exists for Mac; Im more of a compile from source guy. Has anyone here tried compiling wine for OSX so that I can execute exe files on my OSX(10.6)?  Are there any alternatives for wine that you would suggest?  <answer11503> This sounds like what you're looking for: http://code.google.com/p/osxwinebuilder/  <answer11505> It always Build fine on my machines right from the Source. Just live it a try  <comment12027> Package managers also build from source ;) The advantage is that they leave your system in a clean state... have a look at Homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
