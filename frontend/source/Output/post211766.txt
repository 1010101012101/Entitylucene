Cannot change case of an application name <body> I have an application called LICEcap. It's a pretty handy app that allows you to take a GIF video of your screen.  But for some reason, I cannot change the case of the app name. It comes as "licecap.app" by default and I would really like to change its name to "LICEcap.app", but it just won't let me. I can change it to any other name, but whenever I try to name it "LICEcap", it just reverts right back to its all-lowercase "licecap".  How can I fix this?  EDIT: I've discovered something else which may or may not be helpful: If I go into the package contents of the app and change the instances of "licecap" in the info.plist file into "LICEcap", it lets me rename the app to whatever uppercase/lowercase I want, but corrupts the app (Finder says I should move it to the trash).  <answer211774> You cannot change the name because the filesystem is case independent. It is possible to change the filesystem to case dependent, but I would not recommend this. codeLICEcap/code and codelicecap/code are the same!  As others have pointed out in the comments the easiest way is to change to another name first.  Another way is to issue the following command in codeTerminal/code  precodemv licecap.app LICEcap.app /code/pre  <comment255653> Can you change it to another name first, then change back with the case adjusted as you want it? <comment255654> How are you trying to change the file name?  In Finder, or in the Terminal? <comment255676> @Tyson I've tried that, but it just reverts it back to the lowercase version of the name. <comment255677> Changing it to another name then changing it to "LICEcap" preserves the letters, but it somehow reverts it to lowercase a short second after. The `mv` command didn't work either. (Although strangely, after renaming, `ls` shows "LICEcap.app" while Finder shows "licecap.app")
