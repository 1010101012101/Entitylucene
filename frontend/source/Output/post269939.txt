Is there a way in Terminal to highlight the row under the cursor? <body> I need to read a long row of output in Terminal and was wondering if there is a way to have the whole row where the mouse cursor is positioned highlighted. Alternatively, would there be a way to highlight a row and control the highlight with the keyboard?  Thanks.  <comment365161> To clarify (if necessary) I'm looking for an equivalent to row highlighting in Excel (less the column highlight) as provided in this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22349424/ddg#22350417
