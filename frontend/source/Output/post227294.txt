Change Mac Keyboard Identifier after keyboard replacement <body> I replaced my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) keyboard. The U.S keyboard layout is mapped incorrectly now. It seems to be a problem with the keyboard identifier ID (maybe its Bundle ID). It looks like to be Japanese now but I need to change it back to english (I can't achieve this by changing input source and keyboard layout).  <answer227327> I can't find way how do without side app. But i solved with "Karabiner"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTzUh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment276066> This sounds like a "keyboard type" problem, but you should tell us why you think it is mapped like JIS instead of ANSI.  See if this note helps:  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2009/12/fixing-keyboard-type-problems.html <comment276069> Yes it's keyboard type problem but i can't figure out how solve this. My keyboard looks like this https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0810/3669/files/mac-us-english-keyboard_1024x1024.png?1871373995114389746 but mac thinks it's looks like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/oz2xyy2vd0v3qe0/Screenshot%202016-02-13%2015.17.19.png?dl=0 <comment276072> I tried this link http://m10lmac.blogspot.lt/2009/12/fixing-keyboard-type-problems.html but it's not helped <comment276081> So you tried all the suggestions including PMU reset, running keyboard setup assistant from terminal, trashing the keyboardtype.plist? <comment276082> Yes i tried and nothing helped <comment276084> Maybe there is some file which i can edit for change type? <comment276097> I think it would logically be the keyboardtype.plist.  Your machine thinks you have a JIS keyboard and it should be ANSI instead. <comment276104> Yes and i thought that way. But in this file i can't identify where can be keyboard type. <comment276152> Great info, thanks!  This is a rare problem but hard to solve when it occurs.
