May use the San Francisco font for my web apps? <body> I've found that new SF UI font for download (http://nomail.com.ua/font/SF%20UI%20Display). I wonder if it's legal to use it in the web app I am building now, i.e. for commercial use? I haven't found any licence info on the official page (https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).   <answer247061> This question generally answers the question of legality.  Including these font files in your app and using them with code@font-face/code or code@import/code is unquestionably not permitted.  However, for a web app you can non-explicitly use it by specifying special keywords in your CSS:  precodebody {   font-family: system, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont,       "Helvetica Neue", "Lucida Grande"; } /code/pre  This will of course result in slightly different appearances per platform and version (namely non-Apple platforms and Apple systems before iOS 9/OS X 10.11).
