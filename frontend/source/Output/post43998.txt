How do I assign a keyboard shortcut to a service in OS X? <body> I created a service using Automator and I'd like to assign a keyboard shortcut to it. How do I do this?  <answer44001> In strongSystem Preferences/strong, go to strongKeyboard/strong » strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong » Services  Find the service on the list.  To the right of the service name, double-click.  Enter the desired shortcut.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WTC3b.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment185155> This didn't work for me, not sure why. Tried very unique shortcuts using only modifiers and alphas (nothing odd like arrows). Tried relaunching Finder and event rebooting machine. Service works from contextual menu. ??? Mavericks.
