globstar: invalid shell option name on macOS even with bash 4.X <body> The new codeglobstar/code option requires codebash 4/code. So.. Which codebash/code are we on?  precode $bash --version GNU bash, version 4.4.12(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin16.3.0) Copyright (C) 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc. License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt; /code/pre  Let us try out codeglobstar/code :  precode13:39:28/forecast-fresh $shopt -s globstar -bash: shopt: globstar: invalid shell option name 13:39:32/forecast-fresh $ /code/pre  Is there any way to get support for this on macOS?  <answer291290> Entering codeshopt/code will get you a list with all bash options which doesn't include globstar for Apple's bash. Probably bash is compiled without support for this option.  To get a bash executable with globstar install brew and brew's bash:  precode$ brew install bash $ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash $ sudo bash -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/bash &gt;&gt; /etc/shells' $ ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash-terminal-app /code/pre  Then change the default shell opened in Terminal to /usr/local/bin/bash-terminal-app and to suppress the 'Do you want to close this tab?' prompt when closing windows and tabs, add 'bash' to the list of exclusions.  The new option list is then:  precode$ shopt autocd          off cdable_vars     off cdspell         off checkhash       off checkjobs       off checkwinsize    on cmdhist         on compat31        off compat32        off compat40        off compat41        off compat42        off compat43        off complete_fullquote  on direxpand       off dirspell        off dotglob         off execfail        off expand_aliases  on extdebug        off extglob         off extquote        on failglob        off force_fignore   on globasciiranges off globstar        off gnu_errfmt      off histappend      off histreedit      off histverify      off hostcomplete    on huponexit       off inherit_errexit off interactive_comments    on lastpipe        off lithist         off login_shell     on mailwarn        off no_empty_cmd_completion off nocaseglob      off nocasematch     off nullglob        off progcomp        on promptvars      on restricted_shell    off shift_verbose   off sourcepath      on xpg_echo        off /code/pre  <comment367761> that last `ln -s` was the missing step for me.
