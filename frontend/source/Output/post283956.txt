Archive mails in Apple Mail plus Office 365 setup <body> I am using my company mailbox since 2011. It has 18gb and 120.000 emails. I feel it very slow since several weeks and would like to archive a bunch of mails. Whats the right approach for archiving in an Apple Mail + Exchange (Office365) environment?  ul liI would prefer to keep the mails online, not on any of my machines/li liI would like to automate it/li liI expect to significantly increase search speed on normal searches.../li li... but to be able to search through archived emails as well/li /ul  Looking forward to your input. Thanks!
