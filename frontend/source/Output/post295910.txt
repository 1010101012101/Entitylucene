High Sierra: Can't merge BOOTCAMP partition with APSF container <body> I feel like this is a known problem on High Sierra, but I can't delete my BOOTCAMP partition to gain "Free Space" and I also can't expand my APFS container that contains my MACINTOSH HD. It's like they've turned into seperate hard disks, and I can't move over the space from the old file system to the new one. This is what I find when I type diskutil list into terminal:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vlz9o.png" alt="diskutil"  I tried manually deleting the BOOTCAMP partition using terminal, and then expanding the container: I tried using the diskutil apfs resizeContainer. But I got an error saying that the target disk has no space (i.e. it doesn't detect the free space). Any solutions? Thanks in advance.  <answer295967> First convert the former Boot Camp partition to free space:  precodesudo diskutil eraseVolume "Free Space" %noformat% /dev/disk0s3 /code/pre  Then expand your APFS container to the max (0 is a magic size here):  precodediskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0 /code/pre  <comment373707> What did you do to make your BootCamp partition Apple_HFS style (it should be Microsoft Basic Data)? <comment373739> I pressed erase in disk utility and made it into Apple_HFS style. <comment373950> I actually tried this method, but before Dev Beta 7, the APFS container couldn't detect the empty space. In Beta 7 you can just use disk utility to fill the empty space. Not sure if above method will work.
