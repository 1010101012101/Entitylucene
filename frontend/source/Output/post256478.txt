How to force stop all the processing in the background (and map that command to a keyboard shortcut) <body> My Mac has been having a lot of issues lately. Most of them have to do with lagginess and the spinning beach ball appearing quite often, and staying there for a long time. If my Mac is so slow, there must be some processing going on in the background that's using up all of the resources. strongIs there a way to "kill" all that processing going on in the background?/strong If so, stronghow do I map the command to a key combination?/strong em(Because/em when my Mac is hanging up, I can't open up the Activity Monitor. Yes, the lag is that bad! Even when I manage to open it up, it says I don't have permission to use it.)  <comment319953> Um, I don't think it's wise nor advisable to *kill **all** the background processes* on your computer. Some of them are essential for ordinary computer function, like `launchd` or `kernel_task`. It's hard to differentiate between non-essential processes and essential ones, so if you have a problematic process I recommend just killing it specifically. <comment319957> Unfortunately you're basing your question on an assumption that may have nothing to do with why you're suffering the lag you are. That is, the root cause of this may have nothing to do with a background process. Can you edit your question to provide full details of your setup (Mac model, HDD v SSD, RAM, free space on your drive, macOS version). Also, how long has this been happening and does it coincide with any other event such as new software or hardware or macOS update?
