Watching any video in Chrome has red boxes <body> FIXED: Version 53.0.2785.89 (64-bit) fixed it  OLD: I've been noticing this for the last couple months, but whenever I watch a video in chrome (Version 52.0.2743.116 (64-bit)) I see small red boxes over the video. The boxes jump around and flicker. It doesn't matter which site it is for (screenshot is youtube and steam)  Things I've tried:  ol liIt does not happen in safari /li lichrome://flags/#disable-accelerated-video-decode (disabled)/li lichrome://flags/#disable-cast-streaming-hw-encoding (disabled) /li lichrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-h264-with-openh264-ffmpeg (disabled)/li /ol  ï¿¼img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ezmc3.jpg" alt="Red boxes in youtube" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RI8zD.png" alt="red boxes in steam" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rX9xi.png" alt="System description"  <answer251817> Version 53.0.2785.89 (64-bit) fixed it  <comment312965> What Chrome version ar you using? <comment313084> @root Version 52.0.2743.116 (64-bit) <comment313086> actually it just updated to Version 53.0.2785.89 (64-bit) and now its fine.
