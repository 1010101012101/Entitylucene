Turn on Back To My Mac via a Script or Command Line <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Turn on Back To My Mac via a Script or Command Line       The VPN software I use for work (IPSecuritas) requires me to turn off Back To My Mac to start it's connection, so I frequently turn off Back To My Mac in order to use my VPN connection (the program does this for me). I forget to turn it back on however and I'd love to know if there was something I could run (script, command) to turn it back on.  <comment7198> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2/turn-on-back-to-my-mac-via-a-script-or-command-line
