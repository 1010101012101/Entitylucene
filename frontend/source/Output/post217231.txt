How do I set a textfields string to a variable in AppleScript? <body> I want to set the text in a text field to a variable, in this case called variable1. Here's the part of my script.  precodeon button836_(sender)     set variable1 to quoted form of POSIX path of (choose folder with prompt "Choose") /code/pre  That's the first part. But I also wanted to set the text in codetextField/code to the value of codevariable1/code.  I tried doing this:  precode    textField's setString:variable1 /code/pre  But it didn't work. Usually, I have a script that returns the value, and doing codetextField86's setString:script837/code etc. usually works, but it's different here. I even tried this stupid solution:  precode    set variable1script to do shell script "echo " &amp; variable1     textField's setString:variable1script     end button836_ /code/pre  Which should work but it just tells me:  precode2015-11-26 15:12:27.077 [etc.] AppDelegate button836:]: -[NSTextField setString:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x6100001e0200 (error -10000) /code/pre  <answer217280> You must use a method from the strongNSControl/strong class -- Getting and Setting the Controlâ€™s Value   precodetextField's setStringValue:variable1 -- variable1 must contains a string /code/pre  <comment262831> Hm. When do you use `setStringValue` and when do you use `setString`. Do you use value when it is a direct value, and do you use `setString` when the value is returned of something? <comment262845> **setString** is a method for these classes ( `NSTextView`, `NSMutableString` and `SFAuthorizationView`), not for the `NSTextField` class. <comment262846> You can use a direct value or a returned value.
