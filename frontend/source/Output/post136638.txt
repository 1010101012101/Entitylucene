How to share my ethernet connection via WiFi reliably? <body> I have setup my macbook running latest Mavericks to be a WiFi hotspot but it is very very flaky. just I need to turn it off/on multiple times to get it working. and now it's not working at all. Probably needs a restart.  I've tried this about 2 years ago on my mid-2010 running 10.8.x and it was not really stable as well.  I've tried changing the channels and I believe I tried 5GHz as well (channels 36 and above?) and same results.  Any tips/suggestions to get it to work stably?  thanks :)  <comment162155> did you look why is it loosing connection. is it the input source, or output, the signal strength, or crowded channels, the os x?, exterior noise sources, distance ? your question is to vague and to generic to answer. <comment162299> Are you using the built-in Internet Sharing feature of OS X or a third-party tool? In what way are you testing the connection and finding that it's unreliable?
