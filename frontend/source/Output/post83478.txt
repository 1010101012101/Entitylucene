Figure out which app is using Java <body> If I check my activity monitor there is an instance of java that is constantly taking 5% CPU or more. I know that there is some app that are using java on my system and therefore my question is:  Is there any way to figure out what app that is using java without closing all running apps?   Note: All "main" applications is closed (No apps i dock) so I know that that it is one of my background/menubar applications.  <comment96087> Does the output of `ps aux | grep java` in Terminal give a hint? <comment96246> Yeah, it tells me that -Dapp and -DappBaseName is related to CrashPlan but I quit that app and there is no traces left in activity monitor about it so I don't understand how it could be running. <comment96282> The Java process is the trace then :-) <comment96889> CrashPlan runs a background task as well that is controlled by a Launch Daemon in '/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist'. So to stop Crashplan running at all you need to delete this file or change it so it is not enabled.
