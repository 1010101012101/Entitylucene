Is it possible to redefine the keyboard shortcut for deleting files to [delete] loosing the [command]? <body> Is it possible to redefine the keyboard shortcut for deleting files to kbddelete/kbd loosing the kbdcommand/kbd ?br How?  <answer13304> Normally it is possible to customize your own keyboard shortcuts in the Keyboard pref pane, but you cannot re-map the kbdDelete/kbd key.  So in short, no, it is not possible to re-map kbdCmd ⌘/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd to simply the kbdDelete/kbd key.  EDIT:  This would be a "hack", but it just occurred to me that if you have a programmable mouse with an extra button, you may be able to assign the kbdCmd ⌘/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd key combo to that button.  It won't work using the built-in Mouse pref pane, but there may be a third-party app that can do it -- e.g. USB Overdrive or Logitech Control Center (for Logitech mice, obviously).  <comment13995> I assume you want to replace the functionality of 'delete' with the functionality of 'cmd+delete'. Is this correct? <comment14020> also note that in the lingo cmd+backspace = delete and fn+backspace = (forward) delete; just backspace = just backspace. <comment14073> It's about deleting files, not chars. <comment14074> @boehj: correct <comment14075> Believe me I surfed all the options on that pane, that's why I asked. Sad to hear I can't <comment14096> + 1: Very clever re: mapping it to the mouse. <comment14111> @Petruza but your keyboard sends the same keycodes should you work on files or chars. <comment14201> I know, @koiyu, but that's not what I asked. Thanks anyway <comment14202> the mouse hack is ok, but my question was just out of lazyness. I prefer the hassle of pressing `command` than installing a software that will be running there for no really useful purpose. Thanks anyway!
