Acer H277HU monitor is not charging 2016 MacBook when plugged in via USB-C <body> My computer is plugged in to the monitor using USB-C to USB-C. Charging indicator on my battery icon is showing, but the computer continues to drain power.   My co-worker is successfully charging his 2016 macbook pro using the exact same monitor.   <comment362752> Have you tried resetting the SMC or NVRAM? <comment362815> According to [Acer official website](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/EE/content/model/UM.HH7EE.008) your monitor does not have a USB-C port, what means you are using an adaptor. Is your colleague using the same adaptor as you do? Have you tried using his adaptor?
