GarageBand drums and verse <body> What is the best way to add drums after I played my guitar and also what is the best effect for a verse in GarageBand  Thank you  <answer138938> A guitarist needs to learn to follow a drummer so you'd be better off choosing your drum pattern and then playing along to that. Select a very simple beat at first. Not sure what you mean by "what is the best effect for a verse in GarageBand"
