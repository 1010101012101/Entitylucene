HD scan in Mountain Lion <body> I suspect a faulty drive. Anything that could perform a hardware scan (bad sectors?) built into Mountain Lion or available for free off the 'net?  <answer66357> You can try Disk Utility. Click Verify Disk to see if the disk is faulty.  My last HD failed after a year of use. The past month has made the computer really slow. Most HD manufacturer gives out a replacement if it fails within 3 years though.  <answer66373> http://www.titanium.free.fr has a free utility called Onyx which runs cron jobs, toggles hidden prefs and has many other uses but most importantly in this case runs a SMART test on the HD automatically at startup. I have used it for several years and recommend it. It also has a section for UNIX man info as well. Great little free doodad.  <answer66382> Smart Utility is truly excellent and is far better than Disk Utility at spotting hardware issues. You can try it for free. http://www.volitans-software.com/smart_utility.php  <comment78060> Maybe try doing the verify (or repair) off an external drive or the recovery partition. <comment78069> Yep - forgot to mention, did it from the recovery partition.
