Some Buttons becomes unresponsive after updating to iOS10 on iPhone 6s <body> I updated to iOS 10 just after it official release to public.  Now I am facing wiered problem. During using my some of apps I am unable to Tap on some buttons on Screen. But when I relaunch the app I can open.  I tried this with number of apps. Some Games Like COC i am unable to open the Chat Window by Dragging it RightSide.  Some other Apps Like Facebook,Google,Inbox become unresponsive not the whole app but a particluar section. I am unable to figure it out what is going on.
