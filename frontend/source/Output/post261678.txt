Compress/reduce movies without losing metadata <body> My MacBook's drive is quite full and I'm trying to reduce usage.  Most of the storage is being used in Photos for family pictures &amp; videos, e.g. kids' school programs.  I don't need the full fidelity for those, some of which are a couple gigabytes in size.  I noticed that I can right-click on a movie file in the Finder and choose "Encode Selected Video Files", which lets me choose a resolution like 480p, which compresses e.g. a 1.6GB original down to 250MB, with acceptable quality.  Unfortunately all the metadata like date &amp; place of capture are lost when I do this.  I can use something like codeexiftool/code to restore the info:  precodeexiftool -tagsFromFile IMG_2373.mov IMG_2373.m4v /code/pre  but even this gets lost again when I import it again into Photos via drag-and-drop.  Can anyone suggest a workflow for this?  Conceptually I'm looking for something akin to "right-click to compress" inside Photos, if it existed.
