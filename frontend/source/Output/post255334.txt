External HD changed partition map <body> Apparently my external HD went crazy (I've been using it without problem for a long time) and decided to change partition scheme from GUID to FDisk (look at disk1) but my data remains as HFS+ (disk1s2)...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sjv1Z.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKUgw.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have important data in that HD, so my question is     Is there a way to repair this change in partition scheme without losing my data??      Which blocks do I need to delete to create the new GPT scheme?   I have found a program called strongtextdisk/strong that seems to be able to do it but I am afraid of erasing the data by accident.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  strongEDIT:/strong Tried Klanomath suggestion in: Need help deciphering TestDisk results to fix HDD and changed to GPT scheme but got error during verification.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oauPo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment317998> It's possible to repair the disk without *textdisk* (TestDisk?). There are already some questions & answers here. I'll try to find the proper one and add a link here. <comment318001> Here is the proper answer: [Accidently deleted some small sized partitions when installing Windows. OSX Partition wont boot](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/251868/93229). You have to replace disk0 by disk1 in David's answer: `...unmountdisk  /dev/disk1 fdisk  -e  /dev/disk1  ...` <comment318002> @klanomath Thanks! Edited question, but gonna take a look at that. Already changed to GPT scheme but still won't mount. <comment318003> Which answer of mine ("Klanomath's suggestion") are you referring to in your question? <comment318005> @klanomath  sorry, didn't include link but was this one: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/250297/need-help-deciphering-testdisk-results-to-fix-hdd <comment318006> Hmm, what happened with the external disk? Did you attach it to a PC? <comment318007> @klanomath nope, only thing I did was update OS X to "El Capitan" <comment318008> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/46141/discussion-between-klanomath-and-luis-vera).
