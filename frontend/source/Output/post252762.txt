Help with a workflow <body> I sure would appreciate any of you taking a look at where I'm messing up the syntax!   This workflow is to automate the setting of a reminder to carry out an action later in the day depending on which item in a list is chosen, no interval for the reminder is less than 30 minutes, and some are 3 hours later (I bet you can see where this is going!) --  Well, I never would leave WF running I the foreground for so long.  I'd forgotten that iOS only allows the back ground processes 10 minutes before freezing them. So my carefully crafted notification WF wuz DOA.   Now plan is to create a future event at varying times. What I've done (which doesn't work yet) is to set a variable "reminder time." Later I've written Date-- Adjust date (add on a chunk of time) -- Get Variable (reminder time) -- Add New Event, with Start Date = Reminder Time. But no event is created in Calendar app. I can't see where I've screwed up the syntax.   WF to set future reminder events fro pick list choices   Please ignore the rest of the workflow after the first otherwise statement as the WF only has been worked on down to there. The rest are series of if routine using notifications   Thanks for any advice!  <comment314532> Why not just use the  Remainders app? <comment314842> Oh man, duh! I totally overlooked, under scripting, the 'add reminder' routine, seeing only the 'add event.'   Sure appreciate your jogging my brain!
