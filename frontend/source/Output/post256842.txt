User's laptop that does not validate a password upon waking from sleep <body> It is OSX El Capitan, a new 13" MBP recently formatted and reinstalled. She is one of a few users experiencing this behavior: when the computer wakes from sleep, no password with just the return key allows a successful login. I've updated the security settings to enforce an immediate password prompt upon sleep or screen saver; the problem persists.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aKtxI.png" alt="Security and Privacy/General Settings"
