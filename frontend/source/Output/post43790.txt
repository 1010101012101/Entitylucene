How can .wav files be created on an iPhone or iPad? <body> How can code.wav/code files be created on an iPhone or iPad? I want to customize the sounds that Outlook for Windows plays when certain events occur and it would be nice if I could make code.wav/code files on a mobile device and transfer them back afterwards.  <answer43793> h1Twisted Wave/h1  This looks like a solid piece of audio editing software. It uses the internal microphone on your iPad to record audio and can export to code.wav/code or many other formats.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ddux7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer43795> h1WavePad/h1  This also looks like a good app for doing what you want to accomplish. It will export as code.wav/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUM6S.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment49767> Thanks Matt! Nice pictures, too.
