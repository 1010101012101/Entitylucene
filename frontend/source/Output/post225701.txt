Can not resize disk image file .dmg <body> I've found that OS X supports .img files which might be resized after it was created. Interesting thing is I can not resize more than 1 time :) is it real limitation or I'm doing something wrong ?  I've made an image file via Disk Utility, selected image format: sparse. And was able write on it up to the selected size, then I was able to increase it's size once (with Disk Utility), put files up to capacity and THEN I can't resize it anymore img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9ua1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment273948> This is not a limitation and I've resized an image many times. What does Console (/Applications/Utilities/Console.app) say when trying to resize an image? <comment274034> @grgarsiden I checked it, but Console.app keeps silent :(
