How to change a PDF's title? (not file name) <body> I am talking about the title shown in Acrobat Reader's tab strongand/strong title bar that reads "Modern business letter."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5MTjC.png" alt="enter image description here"  I generated the PDF from a .docx document, and the document is generate based on a LibreOffice template (.odt) named "Modern business letter, which is where the title name come from.  I know how to change the template name in LibreOffice, but that can cause unwanted error if I forget to change it the next time I use the same template. How do I change the individual PDF title, either in Acrobat Reader or in Finder?  <answer274705> PDF Info is a mac application that will let you change the title and other pdf meta-data. http://www.sybrex.com/products/macgui/infomanager/  <answer274742> To answer the question you asked, "emHow do I change the individual PDF title, either in Acrobat Reader or in Finder?/em", you can't. Neither Acrobat Reader or Finder, by default and natively, have the capability to edit that information. It needs to be done before being exported/printed to PDF or use an app capable of editing PDF Documents.  The industry standard is Adobe Acrobat however it's an expensive app and overkill if looking to just edit that information.  I have, in the past, used the PDFInfo app mentioned in the answer by בנימן הגלילי , it works and is free. (I have no affiliation with Sybrex Systems, the maker of PDFInfo., other then having used their product.)  hr  If you have codeexiftool/code installed and want to do it from the command line in Terminal, use the following syntax:  precodeexiftool -Title="New Title" /path/to/filename.pdf /code/pre  ul liTo clear the Title, just use: code-Title=""/code/li liOther emmeta-data/em can be changed in a similar fashion./li /ul  <answer274767> You can do this through Automator.  Automator includes a number of functions to codeget/code and codeset/code codePDF Metadata/code including things like "Title."  h3Super Simple:  Create a Workflow Application.../h3  ol liCreate a new Workflow Application/li liChoose Set PDF Metadata (under the emPDFs/em library)/li liSave; when you drop your PDF on the file, it will change the title for you./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dK5YM.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3More Steps, More Flexibility/h3  The downside to that method is that while really simple, you can't programmatically change the Title (for whatever reason, you can't use variables in codeSet PDF Metadata/code).  It's great for batches if you wanted to change the Author or Keywords for a bunch of files.  So, to do this "sorta" programmatically, you have to do it emwithin/em Automator  ol liCreate a new Blank Workflow/li liChoose emGet Specified Finder Items/em (Under Files &amp; Folders Library)/li liChoose emSet PDF Metadata/em (Under PDFs library)/li liDrag and drop your PDF into the top box/li liRun/li liRinse and repeat as necessary/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGCpq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer288126> I found on a iMac, you must open the Word document first and go into File  Properties  Summary and you can edit the name of the Title and Author of the document there. Re-save the Word document. Re-Save as a PDF as normal.   When you open it in PDF, the tab will have the correct title.    <comment345451> Just to clarify, was the PDF itself generated by MS Word, or by LibreOffice? Also, what version of macOS are you running and what version of Acrobat Reader, MS Word and/or Libre Office? <comment345506> @Monomeeth, Personally, I wish every question included the hardware and software information surrounding the question, however... There is no clarification necessary since neither Adobe Reader or Finder, by default and natively, have the capability to edit that information and that's the focus of the question being asked, "_How do I change the individual PDF title, either in Acrobat Reader or in Finder?_". the information you're requesting is not really relevant in this situation. It either needs to be done before being exported/printed to PDF or use an app capable of editing PDF Documents. <comment345543> Nice, I didn't think about Automator and I usual do! Do you know what actual app the Automator Set PDF Metadata action is using to make the changes? +1 even if you don't. :) <comment345544> You cannot either in Reader or Finder... <comment345553> @user3439894 - I don't know the actual app/library - I think it's just built into Automator <comment345570> The reason I asked is `exiftool` doesn't contain any binaries and relies on `perl` (and the various perl libraries) to do it's thing. So in that respect I was wondering if Automator was using anything other then the primary _binary_ within the `/System/Library/Automator/Set PDF Metadata.action` file, which is the Set PDF Metadata _action_ you see in Automator itself, to do the actual work. As an example the Scale Images _action_ uses `/usr/bin/sips` to do that actual manipulation. So it's just idle curiosity if the Set PDF Metadata _action_ is calling an outside _binary_ to do the actual work. <comment363790> What do you do if there is no Word document to start with? <comment363794> OP has already mentioned they are aware of being able to edit the document properties before exporting to PDF (using LibreOffice instead of Word, but the same effect) — this question is specifically about editing a PDF after export.
