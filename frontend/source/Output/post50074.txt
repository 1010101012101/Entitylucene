Is there a way to make the iPad stay in the App Store when you buy an app? <body> This has infuriated me since I got my iPad. If I am buying multiple Apps the iPad takes me to my Desktop after I buy each app, meaning I have to go back to the app store.  Is there a way to tell it to stay in the appstore when I buy an app?  <answer50075> There is no official way to do so, but if you've jailbroken your iPad, you can use StayOpened. It's a Cydia Tweak and I can highly recommend it. It does exactly what you want.
