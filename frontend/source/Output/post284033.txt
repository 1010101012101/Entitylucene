Apache issue: cannot run php files in eclipse, but can do it in browser <body> It seems as though eclipse is ignoring my Apache server located at codehttp://localhost/mysqlitest/mysqlitest.php/code  If I run a PHP file in a browser, it is served as expected. When I run it in eclipse, the following error occurs.  precodePage load failed with error: A server with the specified hostname could not be found. /code/pre  I am using XAMPP and have to resort to using codesudo apachectl start/code, because the start button doesn't work with the GUI.  I just recently realized that apache is already installed on macOS. It's config files are in code/etc/apache2//code. Eclipse is also saying that there is no server with specified hostname. I am wondering if eclipse is listening to the wrong apache install? Apache is running (I can run PHP files in browser). Is there a way to specify which install it listens to?  Thanks in advance  <comment358188> It sounds like you have both servers running on the same port at the same time, resulting in the confusion. You may want to take a look into that.  `sudo apachectl start` also controls the system installation, not that of XAMP so you may want to use `SUDO /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/xampp start` instead.
