How do I make use of the remote disc icon in the sidebar of Finder? <body> I bought the new Mac Mini, which doesn't have a SuperDrive, and I noticed an icon in the sidebar of the Finder: Remote Disc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WAjpE.jpg" alt="screenshot"  To which device is referring?br When I clicked over the sidebar icon with the right button, to get information about the device, I got just genetic information that didn't help me to understand if it is referring to a specific device, and how I can "connect" such device to the Mac Mini.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jf6yl.png" alt="screenshot"  Can I associate the "Remote Disc" with a MacBook's SuperDrive?  <answer23276> Remote Disc is a way for Macs without optical drives (Air, mini) to access another computers optical drive over a network. So you can put a disc in another Mac or Windows PC and read it on your mini.  Full details and instructions are reported here.  On the computer with the CD/DVD drive:   ul liGo to the Preference panel, and click on "Sharing."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmGzJ.png" alt="screenshot"/li liIn Sharing, enable the "CD and DVD Sharing" service.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aia7f.png" alt="screenshot"/li liWhen a CD/DVD is inserted in the computer used to share the CD/DVD, its content will be show under "Remote Disc" on the Mac Mini./li /ul  <comment25980> Documenting at least a few key steps would make this answer a lot higher quality. <comment26020> Also, I would add that the steps above are for the machine with the CD/DVD player. On the machine without a drive, you just find the shared CDs/DVDs under that icon.
