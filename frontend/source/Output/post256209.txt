command line: unmount a smb network drive <body> We use Windows Server for my company network.  I do use Mac has client.  When I mount a network drive, I use the following command line:  precodeosascript -e ‘mount volume “smb://myusername:mypassword@fileserver/department/its”' /code/pre  everything works fine. I am a user administrator for my network, this is the reason why I guess I am able to mount the network drive in this way and everything works fine.  But my question is: stronghow do I unmount this network drive? What is the command line?/strong  thank you so much  <answer256212> codeumount/code is the opposite of codemount/code. You'll need to know the name of the mount point - that is, the name in /Volumes that corresponds to that network drive.  precodeumount /Volumes/VolumeName /code/pre  Per codeman umount/code, codeumount/code may fail for any number of reasons, and the recommend command is instead codediskutil/code:  precodediskutil unmount /Volumes/VolumeName /code/pre  <comment319437> And this is where the confusion comes for me :-) By using the command line that I posted in my original post, does the command line creates a mount point too? or it just mount the smb drive without creating the mount point? The reason why, I receive error message when I execute the following command: diskutil unmount /fileserver/department/its  I receive the following error: Unmount failed for /fileserver/department/its   or if I execute: unmount /fileserver/department/its   I receive: -bash: unmount: command not found <comment319438> `/fileserver/department/its` is not a mount point. Unless otherwise specified with a specific mount point, everything is mounted under /Volumes. You will need to list the contents of that directory and find out what the corresponding name is to your network share. It's probably `its` since that's the last bit of the path from the server. <comment319439> Done. Thank  you. The answer was: diskutil unmount its <comment319440> The other thing is from your previous comment - note that the first command is `umount` _not_ `unmount` (notice that the proper command has no "n" in it). That's why you got "command not found" trying to run `unmount`. `diskutil` by contrast uses  the actual word (with the "n"): `diskutil unmount`.
