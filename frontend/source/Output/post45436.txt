Lost keyboard shortcut for beginning-of-line/end-of-line <body> After purchasing a new computer (Mac Mini w/Lion) and migrating my settings from old one (Macbook Pro w/Snow Leopard), the system shortcuts for beginning-of-line and end-of-line text navigation commands (Cmd-left/right arrow) just don't work anymore, anywhere.   Curiously, this happens only in a single user account, and in other accounts on the same computer it's OK. Other shortcuts with the Command key (like Cmd-up) also work just fine.  I have browsed through the keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences  Keyboard. I also have KeyRemap4Macbook installed and browsed through its settings, to no avail. There is no Keybindings folder in my ~/Library, either.  Anybody have any idea how to even start debugging this problem?  <answer45440> I remember having the same problem in emsome/em apps after upgrading to Lion. A reboot fixed it for me.  Workaround: use kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdA/kbd (instead of kbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd) to move the cursor to the beginning of the line and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdE/kbd to move the cursor to the end of the line (instead of kbd⌘/kbd+kbd→/kbd). This works in all Cocoa-based applications.  <answer45740> Thanks to the commenter Lri for pointing to this question: Command+right/left stopped working! It made me browse through the system shortcuts again, and lo and behold - Cmd+Left &amp; Cmd+Right were indeed in plain sight as shortcuts for "Move Left a Space" and "Move Right a Space" - I didn't even look there before because I did not use Spaces at all in Snow Leo, and so I assumed these shortcuts were inactive. Now the upgrade to Lion and Mission Control activated them, but I still had only one space so they did nothing.  So it was enough to actually redefine them to something else to regain the beginning/end-of-line functionality.  Sorry everyone for misleading with the wrong information (turns out I did not actually browse through emall/em possible shortcuts...)  <comment51764> Thanks for your answer, I know of the workaround but of course it would be nice to be able to go back to the shortcuts that are in my muscle memory after so many years... <comment51768> Did you try a reboot? Did you use Software Update until you’re on the latest version (10.7.3)? <comment51817> Yes, absolutely, I have restarted a couple of times already since first noticing this symptom. I'm also upgraded to the latest Lion available, 10.7.3. <comment51827> Usually the **⌘** key is represented as **@** in dictionary files. It might help running `grep -I "@" ~/Library/Preferences/*` and you might find some settings that are not listed in the Keyboard Preferences. The -I option in the command tells it to ignore binary files, in case you are not familiar with this. <comment52005> See also [Command+right/left stopped working](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23775/commandright-left-stopped-working). (It's not an exact duplicate since the problem was that the shortcuts stopped working only occasionally.) <comment52110> Thanks for the link to that question! It made me browse through the system shortcuts again, and lo and behold - Cmd+Left & Cmd+Right were indeed in plain sight as shortcuts for "Move Left a Space" and "Move Right a Space" - I didn't even look there before because I did not use Spaces at all in Snow Leo, and so I assume these shortcuts were inactive. Now the upgrade to Lion and Mission Control activated them, but I still had only one space so they did nothing. <comment52148> Note: ⌃A and ⌃E are not equivalent to ⌘← and ⌘→. The former go to the beginning/end of the whole line (paragraph), while the latter take word-wrapping into account in Cocoa text fields.
