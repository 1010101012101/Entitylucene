Put owner information on iPhone lock screen (via provisioning profile) without wiping device? <body> Is there a way to setup a device as managed or whatever in order to put owner information on the lock screen without wiping the whole phone? Or, can you at least restore from a prior/unrelated backup afterward?  <answer258535> Why wouldn't you just add the owner information to whatever wallpaper image you're using?  There's no need for an overly technical solution.  <comment323189> Not a direct answer to your question, but this is how I make sure my Emergency info is legible even to people who don't know how to access the 'proper' emergency info on an iPhone - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/246252/how-to-identify-owner-of-lost-iphone/246256#246256 <comment323203> I've done that before, but it doesn't work well with Parallax. There's a built-in way using iOS 10, but it requires provisioning/managed device configuration. <comment323204> A bit of trial & error was all it took to make mine 'parallax-safe'. A dark vignette helped too. <comment323301> Because there is a clean, built-in way to do it that's better designed. However it requires setting up in advance.
