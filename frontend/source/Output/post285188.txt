Can iOS on demand VPN be configured to connect when using unencrypted ("open") wifi networks? <body> In order to prevent my iOS device from sending possibly sensitive data over unencrypted wifi connections, I would like to configure my on demand VPN in such a way that it is automatically established whenever the device is on an uncrypted wifi network. I've found and followed this documentation, but there doesn't seem to be an option to trigger the VPN connection on such networks through codeInterfaceTypeMatch/code or codeActionParameters/code.  Have I overlooked something? Is there any way to trigger on demand VPN for unencrypted wifi networks?
