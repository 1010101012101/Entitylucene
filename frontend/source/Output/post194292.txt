Can't open VCD Video on iMac (OX 10.10.4) <body> Soooo, we have a couple educational VCDs from Taiwan.  Upon insertion, they mount as 2 volumes, Audio CD and VIDEODISC.  A quick Google said to browse to VIDEODISC/MPEGAV and play the DAT files there, which were essentially MPG files with extra (unspecified) data.  But, on both discs emevery/em .DAT file has an i/o error.  It's disc/OS interaction level - Finder won't copy the files, and a Disk Image creation failed (Error message: Invalid Argument), and Disk Utility kind of hangs at exit.  I don't know well the discs were taken care of, so I could see maybe one or two files that would have corruption, but not issues with every .DAT file (70+ files across 2 discs). They're Windows formatted volumes (the VIDEODISC volume has a Windows VCD player executable) but that never was an issue before.  The fact that Disk Utility not only decides not to copy, but seems very confused in general.  Any tips?     <comment231702> Did you try to open them with VLC player, by Starting the VLC then open file? <comment231718> @Buscarì›ƒSD yes, but there's a core I/o error I mentioned. It can't even read the file much less decode and play <comment231737> Sorry, are you saying you can not open that file in the VLC player? if so what error does it gives?
