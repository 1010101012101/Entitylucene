What is webfilterdnsd process? <body> What is webfilterdnsd process running on my machine? Its started by user "nobody". Not able to find any other information on it online. How can I get more information on processes running on my mac?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rmqMz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer37924> Although it doesn't answer your question directly, the excellent  http://triviaware.com/macprocess/all  is a web resource that describes many Mac processes.   It describes webfilterDNSd as:  "Process is part of clean OS X install however there is no description available from credible sources at this moment. Use supplied link for related google search."  There's a comment section by which others that know might be able to answer your question.  <comment42980> Are you running Parental Controls on your Mac? <comment42981> No Parental controls is not running. <comment42982> Well, I haven't been able to find exactly what it does, but some research states that "nobody" is a system user that OS X creates (so it's fine) and webfilterDNSd is a system process.  If Parental Controls are off, I'm not really sure why this is running, but it is most likely benign. <comment42999> Sampling the process gives Process:         webfilterDNSd [112] Path:            /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebContentAnalysis.framework/Versions/A/Resources/webfilterDNSd It looks like its associated with WebContentAnalysis.framework which is likely used by Parental Controls.
