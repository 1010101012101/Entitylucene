Disable hardware trackpad clicking <body> My trackpad is broken, which causes the left-click button to get stuck. This results in a lot of unwanted clicking. Tap-to-click works fine and causes no issues.  Is there a way to disable the trackpad hardware, but not disable tap-to-click?  Thanks!  <answer227708> I do not know of any way to disable the physical clicking of a  Trackpad. The OS X trackpad preferences can be found here, or by going to System Preferences - Trackpad. If the Trackpad is constantly telling the OS to click, then there is little you can do to get around this. Trackpad replacements are $69, I believe, at the Genius Bar.
