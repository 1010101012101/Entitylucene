iPad 2 passcode attempt <body> So, I'm working on my macbook.  My iPad 2 is next to me.  All of a sudden, my ipad lights up as if someone is trying to guess my passcode.  after several attempts (while I watch, dumbfounded), my ipad locks.  Was someone trying to get in my ipad?  Is there something I can do to stop it?  What the hell happened?  <comment174804> Could it be somebody accessing your iPad through iCloud/Find My iDevice? Change your iCloud password and check if somebody has been fiddling in that area
