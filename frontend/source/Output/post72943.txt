Image Capture OS X 10.6 won't read from iPhone <body> Image Capture on Snow Leopard says the "iPhone is locked with code", and asks to unlock it before importing images. The most weird thing is that it can import just fine using iPhoto and it syncs through iTunes. Seems it is a problem with Image Capture, any ideas?  If anyone could try to send the Image Capture.app to me to test with, that would be great. Thanks!  <answer73017> With ImageCapture closed, look in code~/Library/Preferences/code for codecom.apple.Image_Capture.plist/code and codecom.apple.ImageCaptureExtension2.plist/code and move them to the Trash. Preferences files often become corrupt, and this is the first, easiest step.
