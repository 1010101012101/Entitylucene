Strange network activity virus when Aiport is off / No Wifi <body> So I have this strange issue on my aging MPB (pre-retina generation, running 10.8.5 (need this for Maya 2013 to run...), where basically the network is always showing activity even when I am not connected...  I am starting to suspect that there is some kind of virus in play, maybe?  Could someone provide me with some advice. I have captured the activity in a short video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZp5u1nPfw  Note that there are spikes in packets sent/received at about 0.17 seconds into it and again at 0.30 seconds...  How do I begin to diagnose this issue?  Thanks - J   <answer148743> First make sure to disable any Sharing, Airplay ect. and turn off your Bluetooth.  Here is a test you could run in Terminal:  precodeNetstat -i /code/pre  and look who is connected to what, by looking at the en0 (your wifi)  <answer148751> The network traffic is common.  Watching your published video i noticed that you have Little Snitch running.  ol liLaunch codeLittle Snitch Configuration.app/code/li liEnable the codeNetwork Monitor/code and codeShow network activity in menu bar/code/li liQuit codeLittle Snitch Configuration.app/code/li liEnable/Show the codeNetwork Monitor/code by clicking in the new symbol in your menu bar/li liHit the leftmost button and enable codeSort by last activity/code and codeShow local network/code/li liHit the 2nd leftmost button to show a visualization of the network traffic (red indicates outgoing traffic, green incoming traffic)/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HEdDT.jpg" alt="snapshot"  By clicking on one of the processes (in my case the highlighted codecheck_afp/code) all others are shielded in the visualizing part at the bottom and you are free to investigate any special activity. Expanding the little grey triangle at the end of the row of a given process even shows the sources and destinations of the related traffic.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5E2D.jpg" alt="snapshot2"  Now almost any culprit should be seizable.  ul liSorry for any translation issues, i'm using the german interface and i translated it quick'n'dirty.
