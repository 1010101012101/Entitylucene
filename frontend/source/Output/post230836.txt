How not to receive iMessage alerts on iPhone when I am actively using iMessage on Mac <body> When I am engaged in an active iMessage conversation on mac, the incoming messages alerts show on iPhone which is sitting besides me and it is annoying. How can I avoid that?  <comment281827> If handoff is working properly & Messages is foreground on the Mac, the phone should wait up to 30s before assuming you're no longer at the Mac & alerting you to the continuing conversation. Any lock screen notifications will disappear as soon as you switch to Messages [& that current conversation], if it was not foremost. Are you not seeing this behaviour? <comment281828> sounds like my hand off is not working properly, how do i check/fix it? <comment281829> I'd start at the overview on https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18754 <comment281830> Thanks. Am I supposed to manually handsoff to mac for this to work? <comment281833> No. It's supposed to 'just work'. I'm not really sure where to start troubleshooting it, tbh.
