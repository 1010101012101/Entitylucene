"Un-bless" GRUB on Macbook Pro 13 inch? (2015) <body> I have a 13" Macbook Pro (2015 model) with macOS Sierra, that I triple booted with Windows and Deepin. I use rEFInd as a boot loader already. However, after I installed Deepin, it installed and blessed GRUB and it seemed to un-bless everything else. I re-blessed rEFInd but GRUB is still there if I "skip" rEFInd. (I have a timeout of -1, which only shows the rEFInd menu if I press an unused key). It's kind of annoying to always see GRUB when I skip rEFInd to the default OS, and GRUB doesn't give macOS as an option as well. So how can I un-bless GRUB, or make it only run when I choose it in rEFInd?
