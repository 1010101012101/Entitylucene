I want to hear sound of push notification when sound is turned off (like iOS alarm clock) <body> When I receive a push notification no sound is played when the sound is switched of on the device (with switch on side of iPhone).   When I add an alarm event in the iOS clock I do hear the sound although sound is switched off.  Can I force to play sound with Push notifications when sound is switched off?  hr  everybody thanks for the response (this was a programming question)  with regards, Frank  PS I don't know what is meant by fixing up my accept rate but I'll have a look into that...  <answer31886> You can't, the push notification is handled by the iOS. If the user muted his device there is no way force it to play sound on receiving a push notification.  The reason the alarm can play a sound is because it is not bound by the apple rules for app s from the app store.  <comment36571> I actually don't believe apps are *forced* to obey the Silent Mode setting - they are just encouraged to do so. Still, this answer is correct: the Alarm Clock ignores Silent Mode, push notifications evidently do not.
