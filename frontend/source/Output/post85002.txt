Sound check only works when playing songs under playlist or songs section <body> I noticed sound check only works on my iPhone and iPod if you select the music in the "songs" or " playlists" tabs in the music app. I have some albums with different volumes and can only listen to them if I make a playlist with the album ( or else some tracks are just too loud). If you select music under the "artists" or "albums" tabs then sound check doesn't work. I was wondering if anyone knew of a app or tweak that could fix this.
