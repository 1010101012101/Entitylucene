Favorites in sidebar and custom keyboard layout are constantly disappearing after reboots <body> My sidebar is acting weird lately. All my favorites go away after rebooting. I already tried deleting Finder's .plist - didn't help much. Anyone else experiencing similar issues? Apart from that, after every reboot, I have to manually add keyboard layouts that I had before (second language) - it keeps disappearing after every reboot.
