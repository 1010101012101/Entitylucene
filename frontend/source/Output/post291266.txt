iMac kernel panics during sleep <body> Two weeks, my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) started having kernel panics during sleep, effectively turning itself off (With all unsaved data lost, etc) and on while sleeping. I attached one of the crash reports, although I can't seem to find anything relevant in there. Can anybody tell what is the source of the problem and how can I fix it? Thanks.  <comment367733> unfortunately the Crash report is not helpful. Is 'Enable Power Nap' active? (see here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202824) <comment367737> It is, but disabling it will probably only work around the problem; I'd rather have the problem itself fixed. <comment367738> I didn't suggested that and that's not the point - it just answered a question if there is (scheduled) activity during sleep mode. A fact you have not mentioned in your description of the problem and imho a very important one. <comment367740> Just wanted to make that clear, I didn't assume you'd actually suggest so. In any case, other than power nap being enabled, there's no other scheduled activity during sleep.
