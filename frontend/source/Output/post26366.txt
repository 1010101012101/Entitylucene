How can I maximise the life of my iPad battery? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What is the best way to recharge an iPod Touch battery?       Since the iPad battery cannot be replaced, how can I make sure that it lasts as long as possible, preferably years? E.g. should I always keep it charged, or always let the battery run to 0% before recharging?  Note: not the same as How can I make my iPad's battery last longer? which is about battery life emduring use/em.  Update: this question looks very much like: What is the best way to recharge an iPod Touch battery? em(sorry, only found after posting this)/em. This is slightly more general but perhaps is a duplicate?  <answer26369> According to Apple's website:     h2Use Your iPad Regularly/h2      For proper reporting of the battery’s state of charge, be sure to go through at least one charge cycle per month (charging the battery to 100% and then completely running it down).   <comment30117> The thing is, it will probably be the same answer. And the best one will be the one [from Apple's website](http://www.apple.com/batteries/ipad.html) <comment30118> Are you sure that "iPad battery cannot be replaced". Maybe we can not do it ourself, but the Apple Repair Center will, isn'it ? <comment30120> @LoïcWolff The link you provided is the best answer to this question. Can you possibly move it from a comment to an actual answer? (I didn't want to slide in and write one up as you clearly got to this first.) I think the following is more than enough to answer the question (from Apple's article) *"For proper reporting of the battery’s state of charge, be sure to go through at least one charge cycle per month (charging the battery to 100% and then completely running it down)."* There's really nothing else to add on top of that (everything else being snakeoil). <comment30122> Yes, you're all correct. The battery can be replaced ([by Apple](http://www.apple.com/batteries/ipad.html)). And this is probably a duplicate. If so, please close and accept my apologies... :) <comment30126> @cksum done. Even though it's kind of a duplicate, people searching for "iPad" will more likely find it on Google. <comment30128> @Philip - if you must close this, please re-read the question because you've chosen the wrong "duplicate". <comment30129> Changed the duplicate link. Sorry I missed that. If it still isn't correct, just @me with the proper link. Cheers <comment30130> @PhilipRegan, no problem, thanks. I suggest you *don't* close it based on the other comments here. But it's up to you - you're the expert! ;)
