Why does text appear blurry when zooming in Safari until you release your fingers from the trackpad? <body> This has been bothering me for a while. When you zoom in Safari (Mac) using the pinch gesture, the text is only anti-aliased after finishing the gesture, not in realtime. Why not?  <answer81679> Probably to give a smoother and better user experience while browsing the web. If it did it in real time all systems wouldn't be able to handle it that well.  <comment94177> So AA is really that demanding? What a shame. I often zoom in for only half a second to read something and zoom out immediately afterwards without lifting my fingers, so it's a bit annoying.
