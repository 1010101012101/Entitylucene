Can't send using Mail. I get "The SMTP connection to server "smtp.gmail.com" failed." <body> I've tried answers given on this site. MailPreferencesAccountEdit Server List etc. Tried re-entering the information (which is unchanged and correct.) Default ports are 25, 465, and 587. Changing to 465 made no difference.  This is happening more and more frequently, and then suddenly it'll correct itself. Extremely frustrating. Right now the list shows both servers are Offline. Why that should be, I don't know.  Any help greatly appreciated.

There is a test you can do in Terminal with "Telnet"  Basic connectivity test is done with depending on what port you're using to send, type 'codetelnet smtp.gmail.com 25/code' or 'codetelnet smtp.gmail.com 587/code' in the Terminal prompt window and press Enter  subsource: http://www.socketlabs.com/blog/diagnosing-smtp-service-connection-issues//sub  <answer199889> I find a page talking about how to correct this error when sending mails.

SMTP is OUTBOUND. <comment240821> "emma24xia," That is a **really** good link on troubleshooting mail.app issues. One thing I found was just unchecking the checkbox for "automatically detect and maintain account settings" can fix a multitude of troubles. <comment240917> It would be great if you could summarize some of the recommendations <comment323583> yes this just started happening to me and I figured out it was the wireless network at the office that I'm connected to that was preventing e-mail from going out.
