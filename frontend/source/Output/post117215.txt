eclipse wrong VM related to java 1.7 <body> So I have been searching for hours on this.   So I installed java 1.7 on my mac before I realized I wanted/needed to use 1.6. I have managed to change everything so that the command line sees version 1.6. My issue is that whenever I try to compile something in eclipse it is saying "Specified VM install not found: type MacOS X VM, name Java SE 7 [1.7.0_45]"  I tried to reinstall 1.7 to see if that would fix things. It hasn't.  I am in OSX 10.8  EDIT:  The solution for now was to blow away my workspace and check everything out again  <answer117737> Look in codePreferences &gt; Java &gt; Installed JREs/code to see what JREs Eclipse knows about. You can add and remove JREs here.  <answer124306> I had the same problem when I used ant build. The problem was in the "External Tools Configuration...". The JRE was set to 1.7.45, which no longer existed.  <answer157435> Eclipse is not good at updating its configuration :). go ahead and check for the right JRE in the following spots:  ul liEclipse global preferences (Eclipse preferences  Java  Installed JREs)/li liProject properties  Libraries /li /ul  I had the same problem using ant build. The way to fix it there is by going to Run  External Tools  External tools configurations... and adjusting the JRE on the JRE tab  <comment137697> This is set to JRE 1.6 but when I run my ant build file it is still giving me the error concerning running the 1.7 VM
