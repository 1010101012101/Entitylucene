Comfortable way to archive and log terminal input <body> I often want to reuse a terminal command that I already used in the past. I know two ways how to do this:  ul liUse the "up" arrow to browse through old commands./li liCopy a bunch of commands into a script./li /ul  Now I'm looking for something like an archiving tool, where I could comfortably collect useful terminal inputs. Is there something more comfortable than the "up" key or copying into scripts?  <answer191902> Maybe not quite what you're asking for, but an elegant solution: Press CTRL-R and it will invoke a search through your entire history. Pressing CTRL-R again will display the next search result.  Another solution would be to use something like TextExpander etc. You define your commands there and call them by shortcuts. Unfortunately it doesn't work with the built in OS X shortcuts from the System Preferences - I did not get it working.  <answer191906> It's not totally clear to me what you want, but if I understand correctly you want:   ol lito comfortably look through the history of used terminal commands/li liselectively save them to a script for re-use/li /ol  To achieve strong1/strong this answer already has an explanation. Objective strong2/strong can be achieved by simply copy pasting the desired commands from the code~/.bash_history/code file. Or, if you have some commands that you use often you could create an alias. That is a sort of short cut to a certain command. A permanent alias can be created in the code~/.profile/code file. The code~/.profile/code must then be loaded at every startup of Terminal.app. To achieve that go to the Terminal preferences and fill in codesource ~/.profile/code in run command at startup field:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zY4DA.png" alt="enter image description here"  An example of aliases I have in my code~/.profile/code file are shown below  precodealias showinvisibles="defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES" alias hideinvisibles="defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO" /code/pre  Now, whenever I type codeshowinvisibles/code actually the command codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code is executed.  <answer191946> precode cp ~/.bash_history ~/Documents/bash_history_`date \"+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S\"`.txt /code/pre  <comment228077> BTW: A very useful replacement for the Terminal app...  http://iterm2.com  It has a powerful shortcut section in the preferences!
