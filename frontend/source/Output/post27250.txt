Not able to open DVD tray in brand new MacBook Pro <body> I just bought a brand new 13" MacBook Pro, i5 2.3 GHz, running Mac OS X 10.6.7.  I'm not able to open the DVD tray of my Mac. I have tried pressing down the kbd⏏/kbd key in the top right corner several times, as well as kbdfn/kbd+kbd⏏/kbd, but no success.  Is there some defect with this MacBook Pro or is there some other way to open the DVD tray?  <answer27252> The SuperDrive is slot-loading. You don't open it, but rather slide the CD/DVD into the slog. When you press the eject key, the drive will eject the disc.  <answer27253> Is there a DVD in the drive in the drive you want to eject?  MacBooks use slot drives meaning there is no tray at all, you just push the CD/DVD (gently) into the slot til the drive 'grabs' it and pulls it in (HT1360).  In case you need to eject a disc which doesn't react to the usual means, the following may help (taking more or less verbatim from Apple):  strongEjecting a CD or DVD when all else fails/strong  ul liFirst, quit all applications that are using files on the disc. Then try one of the following alternate methods/li liOpen Disk Utility (in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder), select the disc, and choose File  Eject./li liChoose Apple menu  Restart and hold down the mouse or trackpad button until the disc ejects./li liReboot the computer and keep the mouse/trackpad pressed/li /ul  <answer27260> As a side note, since you're coming from the world of CD trays to the slot loading drives:  strongDo Not/strong put oddly shaped CDs in the drive. These are much less common now than they used to be, but the business-card shaped CDs, or half-sized CDs etc.? They don't belong in your drive. It's entirely possible that the mechanism that ejects CDs from your drive won't be able to reach them. Which means a tech having to open up your machine and getting the CD out that way.  <comment31265> Thanks man. I am new to mac and I thought mac might has a tray which will eject upon pressing eject key. Thanks again you just made my day wonderful. <comment31267> Thanks for your reply. I thought there will be a tray that will eject upon press of key like in window based computer. Thank you very much.
