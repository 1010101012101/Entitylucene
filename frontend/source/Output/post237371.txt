How to Install pdfimages in El Capitan? <body> I am reviewing the answer here about emExtracting embedded images from a PDF/em. It is not in Homebrew.   hr  How can you install codepdfimages/code in OS X El Capitan?  <answer237375> You can install via Homebrew with the following command:  precodebrew install poppler /code/pre  <answer237394> Another command-line program that can extract bitmap images from PDF files is the command-line version of the Unarchiver app called 'unar'. (Doesn't need Homebrew or anything to install.) The command is simply codeunar filename.pdf/code  http://unarchiver.c3.cx/commandline  (The original GUI-based Unarchiver.app does this as well.)  <comment290692> Can `pdf2image` be the same command as `pdfimages`? <comment290697> @Masi sorry my mistake. I update my answer. <comment290734> Can `poppler` be the same as `pdfimages`? <comment290735> Yes. The package contains pdfimages. <comment290736> Do you have any idea how well Unar does with vector images? <comment290758> Unar doesn't convert vector to bitmap images, nor does it save individual document pages.
