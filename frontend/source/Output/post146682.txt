screensaver two monitors two images <body> I'd like to display a different image on each of my two monitors as the screensaver. The "Classic" screensaver almost does this, but it always mirrors the same image to both monitors.  A way to display a single, larger image spanned across the two screens would also work just as well for me.  <answer146699> Setting your screensaver to use your iPhoto library will have it display different images on each display.  If codeMy Photo Stream/code and codePhoto Library…/code are not choices listed in the Source list box, you may need to rebuild your thumbnails and/or cache in iPhoto first (start iPhoto while pressing kbdoption/kbd+kbdcmd/kbd).  <comment172856> as long you use the monitor mirroring how would that work <comment173271> Are you sure about that? <comment173278> It certainly does so on my Lion 10.7.5 system. <comment173466> @Buscar웃: I don't. The Classic screensaver mirrors the images to both of the un-mirrored monitors. <comment173473> You'll need to explain what you mean. I can't find any mention of the word "iPhoto" in the screensaver config dialogs. <comment173552> In 10.9 I only get the same image. @bukzor  When you select one of the Photo Themes, under the preview on the right you will see a drop down to select source. That where you go to finder your iPhoto.. <comment173613> @bukzor, you may need to address issues with iPhoto. See my edited answer.
