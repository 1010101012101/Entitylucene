How can I prevent accidentally quitting an application? <body> I use Adium, but if I set a "Quit Confirmation" in the advanced preferences, it cancels log out. If I don't, it is way too easy to quit it, since it gets focused between apps sometimes.  Is there any way I can have a "Quit Confirmation" show up when I try to quit Adium, except when I am logging out or shutting down the OS?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bhi5F.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer24727> You can do the following to make it a little bit harder to quit Adium by accident. I think this should solve your problem.  Start by opening System Preferences  Keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MDANO.png" alt="System Preferences Keyboard"  ol liClick Keyboard Shortcuts in the pillbox above./li liMake sure you have codeApplication Shortcuts/code selected in the left bar./li liClick the kbd+/kbd button to add a new shortcut./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1LfTE.png" alt="Add Keyboard Shortcut"  ol start="4" liSelect Adium from the Application dropdown./li liType "Quit" in the menu title field./li liPut your cursor in the Keyboard Shortcut field and type kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdQ/kbd/li liClick Add/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hKoqV.png" alt="Add Adium shortcut"  And you're done. You can close your System Preferences because the Quit command in Adium has been remapped to a less-likely-to-be-accidentally-typed shortcut.  <comment27738> Would it be enough to remove the command-Q shortcut for Quit? <comment27749> @GEdgar If it is only for the App in question, sure. <comment248113> To disable quit for all apps see [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/205742/109005).
