How to get iLife '13 for free (update from iLife '11)? <body> I currently have iLife '11 installed on my iMac from a retail disk purchased new from eBay. Under the updates section of the App Store, there is nothing that says iLife Update.   I thought updates for iLife '11 to iLife '13 would be free?  <answer111019> strongYou thought right/strong, the update to new iLife is free.  However, Apple had dropped the "iLife" name a while ago, now the apps are just being called emiPhoto/em, emiMovie/em and emGarageBand/em.  To get the new versions of the apps, follow these steps:  ol liUpgrade to emMavericks/em via App Store. This requires strongat least OS X 10.6.8/strong to be installed./li liChange system preferred language to English and strongreboot/strong your Mac./li liOpen App Store and search for emGarageBand/em. It is free now, no matter if you had iLife before./li liGo to strongUpdates/strong tab and wait for a minute. Newest versions of emiPhoto/em (9.5) and emiMovie/em (10.0) should appear./li /ol  Note, that even pirated and demo versions of emPages/em, emNumbers/em, emKeynote/em, emiMovie/em, emiPhoto/em and emAperture/em can be upgraded via App Store. They will appear in strongPurchases/strong tab a strongfew minutes after/strong the upgrade.  strongTroubleshooting/strong  ul liIf you do not see a response to strongUpdate/strong button click, check your emLaunchpad/em. Upgrades are downloading in background./li liIf you are getting an error about wrong Apple ID when trying to upgrade, try installing strongOS X Mavericks/strong in a virtual machine (emVMWare Workstation/em or emVirtualBox/em) and repeating the fourth step./li /ul  <comment130543> Have you already checked all the stuff written about this last month, like http://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/22/some-users-with-older-copies-of-ilife-and-iwork-having-difficulties-upgrading-to-new-versions/ <comment130545> Have you upgraded to Mavericks? They didn't show for me until after I had upgraded. <comment132296> I have iLife 08. Is it possible to get the latest updates without first updated to iLife 11? Checking for updates manually brings me to a [broken link](http://www.apple.com/ilife/upgrade/). <comment132447> If newer versions of iPhoto and iLife are not appearing in Updates tab in Mavericks App Store, remove 08 and download 11 from TPB and retry. <comment140460> @styfle: the free upgrades are only available if you have the previous version of iLife ('11). For example, my wife's MacBook came with iLife '08 and the Mac App Store lists the new version of iPhoto as $15.
