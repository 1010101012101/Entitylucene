As of Mountain Lion, Google Chrome has asked for permission to view my contacts. Does this mean that it has likely had unrestricted access before? <body> I'm not sure why Chrome wants this access, but since prior to Mountain Lion there wasn't a prompt for this, it makes me think that it must have been looking at them this whole time. Right?  <answer57638> Yes, right.  Round about Tiger (10.4) Apple introduced a nice neat way for apps to integrate with your address book and calendar data stores etc.  At the time it was a novel thing that allowed for any number of clever calendar widgets etc, and stuff that could happily replace the in-built tools (or enhance them) without you having to change anything at an account or data level.  These days, because of a number of high profile mobile apps getting in trouble for doing what the desktop OS have been doing for years, they are cranking up the security and privacy options.  <answer77316> To turn this off and eliminate the error messages, you can do the following:  ol liClick the Chrome menu  on the browser toolbar. Select Settings./li liClick Show advanced settings and find the "Passwords and forms" section./li liClick "Manage Autofill Settings" /li liDeselect the "Include addresses from my Address Book card" checkbox./li /ol  <comment66234> Interesting, when does it ask? Mine didn't ask for anything... <comment66236> It was only the first time I launched it. <comment66239> My version of Chrome doesn't ask either.  Whether or not it was the first time you launched it is irrelevant; apps need to ask for Contacts permission on ML regardless of if you've launched them before. <comment66264> FYI, the reason why Chrome prompts to access your Address Book is for autofilling forms. There is a setting to include info from your address card. It probably will not prompt if you have not enabled this feature. <comment199358> +1 for pinpointing the precise feature that is the source of the behaviour!
