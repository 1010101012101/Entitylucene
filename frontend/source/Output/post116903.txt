Some photos in iPhoto showing as grey triangle with exclamation mark <body> I am unable to view/access some photos - I get a grey triangle with an exclamation mark in it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Byjf.png" width="150"  <answer116905> Try repairing the library. Hold ⌘⌥ and open iPhoto, then choose Repair Database.  If that doesn't fix it, hold ⌘⌥ and open iPhoto again, and select Rebuild Database.  <answer180495> If you open the image and see the exclamation mark, select Photos from the menu bar and click on the dropdown that says "Revert to original". I did that because repairing and rebuilding the database didn't work for me, and magically the image re-appeared.  In most cases the photos had to be edited meaning I must have repositioned or edited them at some point. So, you might have to use the arrow to turn your photo upright.  <answer272813> Revert to original was grayed out for me too, so I tried "Rotate Clockwise" and that Worked!  I then selected "Rotate Counterclockwise" and the image was visible again in the proper orientation.  <answer278666> After my update to Sierra, some of my photos appeared as grey triangles with an exclamation point too. I fixed it by selecting them and rotating the clockwise and counter clockwise. They didn't all change back immediately, but they all eventually reappeared.  <answer286796> Turning them horizontally makes them appear for some odd reason.  <answer294901> I had this same issue although neither the database rebuild or rotating worked for me. I notice when I right click and play slideshow though the image is still there but it's really low resolution and it can't be viewed any other way.  <comment298821> I've moved from iPhoto to Photos one year ago. I'm facing the same problem now, repairing Photos library didn't work and my last photo in iPhotos is from 2015. I'm a bit wary of repairing iPhotos without my latest pictures in it, concerned of what might happen to the Photos library. <comment298822> What if "Revert to original" is grayed out in the menu? <comment361981> Welcome to Ask Different.
