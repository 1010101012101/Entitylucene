iPhone 6s screen turns black after successful replacement <body> I just replaced my sister's iPhone 6s screen. When I first assembled it back together the display didn't work. I opened it back up again and disconnected and reconnected all 3 connectors that come from the display. Then everything (screen, touch id, front camera, proximity sensor and speaker) worked. Then after around 30 minutes the screen suddenly without much phone movement displayed black again. No matter how many times i reconnected the connectors of the screen etc. it wouldn't turn back on again (the phone itself still works). Is there something i might have overlooked or anything i can do?
