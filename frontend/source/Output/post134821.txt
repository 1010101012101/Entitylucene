Remove devices associated with iCloud account <body> I'm trying to remove my MacBook Pro from being associated with my iCloud account however, when I try to remove the account a dialogue prompts me to make sure that I would like to remove it. For some reason, it lists my device several times and doesn't actually delete the account. I would like to remove any association of my Internet Accounts from my iCloud account and remove the numerous of 'Daniel's MacBook Pro' from my iCloud account.  I have attached screenshot of what I'm prompted with showing the number of 'Daniel MacBook Pro' on the dialogue. Is there a way I can manually remove my MacBook Pro from being associated with my account and, in a sense, start afresh.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mIMSi.jpg" alt="System Preferences showing a list of &#39;Daniel&#39;s MacBook Pro&#39; for some reason..."  <answer154417> h3Removing an associated device or computer from an Apple ID/h3  To remove a device or computer from your Apple ID:  ol liOpen iTunes./li liSign in to your Apple ID by choosing Store  Sign In from the iTunes menu./li liChoose Store  View My Account from the iTunes menu. /li liFrom the Account Information screen, click Manage Devices./li liClick the Remove button next to the device name you would like to unassociate./li /ol  http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4627  <comment159706> So if you click "Remove From All" it will keep it activated? <comment159708> Yes, it stays on the devices and then when I press it again it adds another 'Daniel's MacBook Pro' to the list. <comment167116> I've gotten into a mess like this not that long ago after playing around with the Yosemite beta. It took a call to Apple customer support to de-authorize all devices and clear that out. I don't think there's another way around it either, since the data appears to be corrupt on the server side.
