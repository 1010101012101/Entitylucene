Formatting USB Disk As EXT3 On Mac <body> How can I format a USB disk as ext3 using OS X Yosemite?    I want to use it on another system that is linux based but I wish to format it first before connecting to the linux system.  <answer171507> One totally free way of doing things would be to install VirtualBox and create a virtual machine which will run your favourite Linux distro. You should be able to do this with minimal impact on disk space.  I'd personally just use a common file format such as the universal FAT file system but obviously this isn't the answer you're looking for.  <answer171766> There is the commercial product Paragon ExtFS for Mac with which you can format even ext4 - I use it from time to time to access ext3 external hdd and it works quite well.  From their website:  precodeFull read/write access to Ext2 / Ext3 / Ext4 partitions under Mac® OS X Transfer rate is similar to the native Mac® OS Extended file system performance Auto-mounting of Ext2 / Ext3 / Ext4 volumes Full support of OS X 10.10 Yosemite! /code/pre  No affiliation or whatsoever.  There is also OSXFuse as described in this artticle, but I do not think you can format a hdd with it.  Otherwise I agree with ScunnerDarkly - install linux in a virtual machine - or run a live disk (e.g. ubuntu) in a Virtual Machine, which might be the easiest.  <answer234316> I needed to format a partition to codeext3/code on my USB flash drive. The drive was already formatted, and had 3 partitions, and I wanted to convert partition 1 from FAT32 to ext3.  ol liinstall codebrew/code, visit codehttp://brew.sh//code/li liinstall e2fsprogs using codebrew install e2fsprogs/code/li lifigure out the name of your partition or drive using codediskutil list/code -- in my case, my partition had was on disk2 and had the identifier of codedisk2s1/code/li licodesudo $(brew --prefix e2fsprogs)/sbin/mkfs.ext3 /dev/disk2s1/code but you may need to change the drive from codedisk2s1/code to the partition or drive that you want to format. This command will ask you to verify the name of the partition, just to be sure :)/li /ol  Note, if you're able to ssh/telnet into your router running dd-wrt or tomato, you can already directly run codemkfs.ext3/code directly in the router, and don't need to do anything on your mac at all  <answer239164> If you acquire Paragon ExtFS, you get a series of osxfuse file systems.  It will add the following filesystems to your system can be seen by Disk Utility to code/System/Library/Filesystems/code:  precodeUFSD_EXTFS                      Extended Filesystem 2 UFSD_EXTFS3                     Extended Filesystem 3 UFSD_EXTFS4                     Extended Filesystem 4 /code/pre  Run codediskutil Listfilesystems/code to view all supported systems installed on your machine.  Find your drive device:  codediskutil list/code  Assuming it is code/dev/disk2/code You can just type: codediskutil eraseDisk/code for the expected input:  precodeUsage:  diskutil eraseDisk format name [APM[Format]|MBR[Format]|GPT[Format]]         MountPoint|DiskIdentifier|DeviceNode /code/pre  I would run:   precodediskutil eraseDisk UFSD_EXTFS4 BananaPi /dev/disk2 /code/pre  When you are done you should see something like this codediskutil list/code  precode/dev/disk2 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 GB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:           Linux Filesystem                         3.6 GB     disk2s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3 /code/pre  You can then (supposedly--according to the Paragon manual) mount it (unfortunately only with paragon tools):  precode/usr/local/sbin/mount_ufsd_ExtFS /dev/disk2s2 /Volumes/mountPoint  /code/pre  hr  h1Addendum/h1  Read-Only Solution   https://github.com/gerard/ext4fuse  <comment225882> This falls short if you're trying to format an SD Card, as it runs on the PCI-E bus and can't be passed through to virtual machines. <comment286449> Also, when you try to boot a Linux distribution from an SD Card, it says that a Live OS cannot be found, since it does not support PCiE <comment294522> THANK YOU!  This info was super useful, and I haven't seen it anywhere else in all my googling.  BTW, my OpenWRT on WRT1900acs does not find `e2fsprogs` so I was struggling to get my USB formatted. <comment295276> I got stuck on this getting this error: '/dev/disk2: Resource busy while setting up superblock', until I tried 'diskutil unmountDisk disk2' then the following command worked 'sudo $(brew --prefix e2fsprogs)/sbin/mkfs.ext3 /dev/disk2' <comment356860> Especially appreciated the DD-WRT note as it saved me the step of fetching the drive from the router to partition and format on my OpenWRT.
