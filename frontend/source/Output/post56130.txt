How to Retrieve the Wi-Fi Password of a Connected Network on a Mac <body> I need to find the password for a Wi-Fi network that I am already connected to. I'm using a MacBook Pro that's running OS X Lion. Any guidance is appreciated.  <answer56131> strongSpotlight &#x2192; Keychain Access &#x2192; type Wi-Fi name &#x2192; brselect key &#x2192; enter password to see Wi-Fi password/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jO1IN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer56132> If the password is stored, you can find it using the program Keychain Access.  If you open code/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access/code, it will show you a list of stored entries. If you click the strongKind/strong column header, it will sort by kind, go to the section where emAirPort network passwords/em are stored. On Yosemite, you may have to select "Local Items" rather than "login" under Keychains in the upper left.  Double-click the name of the network you are using (if you don't know the name of the network, you can find it in the WiFi menulet (the concentric quarter circles toward the right side of your menu bar).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E4oNi.png" alt="picture of Keychain Access"  Check the strongShow password/strong box, enter emyour/em system password, and click the strongAllow/strong button.  That should show you the password for the wireless network you are on, if it is stored on your computer. If no such entry appears, it means the password is not stored on your computer.  Note that you can also use this technique to find saved passwords for websites or other passwords that you computer has stored but you have forgotten.  <comment185413> On Yosemite click in the "Local Items" Keychains section :) <comment229310> @montogeek: Your comment is important... without that, Airport network passwords didn't show up for me at all. I edited the answer to include your tip: 'On Yosemite, you may have to select "Local Items" rather than "login" under Keychains in the upper left.' The edit is in an approval queue now. <comment264486> On my computer, some wifi passwords are under the System tab and others are under the login tab. <comment275370> Clicking on 'Show Password', checks and then unchecks the box without any popup asking for System Password. Hence, password can't be seen. <comment292414> Note that if your stored password come from a different device (for example an iPhone), it is stored under the iCloud section on the left panel. <comment323574> on Mac OSX Sierra, I had to click on the Local Items. Then Click on the Wifi network SSID and then enable the checkbox "Show password". Worked perfectly.
