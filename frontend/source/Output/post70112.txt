Remove one of two nicknames under one Apple ID <body> I have 2 nicknames in Game Center. One is mine and one is my sonâ€™s for his iPod. It no longer lets me get to mine, it just pulls up his. Any idea how I can delete a nickname for my Apple ID? It does not let me do this while editing my Apple ID.
