Does screen sharing work when not on the same local network? <body> Does screen sharing (System Preferences  Sharing  Screen Sharing) work when the computers are on different networks?  For example, if computer A is using Wifi in Texas and computer B is using Wifi in New York, will this still work?  <answer93799> Yes. And you can make it work through most firewalls if you're both using Messages. Messages will broker the handshake to start the session and then turn it over to the screen sharing app.  Start up Messages and make sure Screen Sharing is enabled:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dlIAB.png" alt="Enable screen sharing in Messages"  Find your buddy in your contact list in Messages and click on them. Then select codeBuddies -&gt; Share My Screen with Buddy.../code or codeBuddies -&gt; Ask to Share Buddy's Screen.../code from the menu bar to initiate a screen share session. You can share control with these sessions.  <answer93802> Yes, as long as you strongport forward/strong (codevnc://router.address:5900/code).  VNC default port is 5900, so make sure that your router is correctly port forwarding this. You can change the port in your router settings.  This Apple KB article gives more details about OS X screen sharing.  <answer229255> If you are trying to access one of your own computers that uses strongyour/strong same Apple ID, the best method is to use Back to My Mac.  You have to make sure you enable "Back to My Mac" in the iCloud Preference Pane on strongboth/strong computers:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jAE7t.png" alt="enter image description here"  Under the Sharing Preferences pane disable Remote Management if it is enabled, and then enable Screen Sharing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iIRLX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Wait a moment and your computer should show up in Finder under the Shared section.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kgj11.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you don't see a "Shared" section or the computer doesn't appear there, click on Finder and then open Finder's preferences (âŒ˜+,) and make sure that everything in the Shared section is selected:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbhVl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment110003> @grgarside Messages uses `Screen Sharing.app` to share the screen once the handshake is made. <comment110008> This really depends on the nature of the network connection since as long as the packets arrive and the Mac can route packets back and forth, a network connects two machines no matter how many hops and devices are in between. <comment110010> Very similar to this question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88117/control-mac-remotely-from-multiple-different-networks-using-only-apple-software <comment110034> And port forwarding requires you have access to your router's firewall, which isn't always the case. In any case, two different approaches -- the OP is free to choose the one they feel is more correct for their situation. And you can down vote my answer if you don't think it applies.
