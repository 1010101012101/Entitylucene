I restored my iPhone but it always says Activation Error, what should I do? <body> I forgot my passcode so I go on iTunes to restore it, but after the restoration, it says emActivation Error/em after I put in the Wi-Fi Settings. I have tried it many times but it still hasn't worked.   I didn't jailbreak my phone, just forgot the passcode so I restored it. I do not have any SIM card in the phone.  Is there something I can do to get the phone in working order again?  Is there any way that can avoid using SIM card?  precode**I fixed it ;)** /code/pre  <answer82849> Activation through iTunes or Over the Air (OTA) is when the device checks to determine if it is factory or carrier unlocked or if it needs a SIM to be activated.  It's almost certain that your failure to activate is due to not having a SIM card from the proper carrier. You do not need to have an active contract or phone number associated with the SIM (I have a 3GS which has an old SIM without a plan), it just has to be for the correct carrier.  <answer84888> all you have to do is put in a sim and turn it on it will work perfectly fine.. good luck  <answer90657> well, the only way you can solve this problem is a sim card. if you dont have one, i suggest you ask your mom or dad or friend or someone with a sim card. you can borrow it from them and then take it out and then ur in. i had the same problem. best of luck :)
