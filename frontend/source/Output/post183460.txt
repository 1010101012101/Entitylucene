I cannot sign in to App Store with my Apple ID <body> I created a new Apple ID and verified it. In the App Store, when I want to update or upgrade my OS X, it is asking me to sign in to download. I try to sign in but I cannot — there is no error or warning. I click sign in button and the sign in button appears again.   I tried to reinstall OS X but during the reinstall I am asked for my Apple ID and clicking the sign in button has no action and I am asked to sign in again.  What is the problem?  <answer184493> If you've created a new Apple ID, you need to have a valid OS X purchase  under this new Apple ID? Otherwise you might have to use—at least for the install—the Apple ID you used to buy OS X.  <comment218737> Reset your Apple ID. <comment218757> I've tried to make this non-answer into an answer, but feel free to edit if you feel I've lost clarity. <comment218974> @FLIR31207 thanks, i didn't know that. I am already using my mac with valid os x, why i have to buy again? Anyway, i understood.
