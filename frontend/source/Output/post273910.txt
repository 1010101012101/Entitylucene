Desktop folders missing after updating to El Capitan <body> I updated to El Capitan and all the folders that started with numbers disappeared and I cannot find them anywhere. One was 2016-2017 and has all my files for the year at school in there. Does anyone have any idea where they went?  <comment344386> Can you clarify _how_ you updated to El Capitan? Also, can you confirm the folders were located on the desktop?
