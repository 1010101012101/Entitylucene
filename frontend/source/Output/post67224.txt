Configure QuickLook to open particular files <body> I'm wondering if there's a way to get QuickLook open up files it doesn't recognize.  For example, I'd like to be able to have QuickLook view .mailsignature files in the basic text viewer. Any suggestions?  <answer67228> You might be able to open them with QLStephen which opens all kinds of files that are plain text.   I am hesitant to recommend it since it will try to open every file for which you don't have another plugin as plain text which is not helpful. It has a blacklist but I found myself constantly adding things to said list which makes it kind of bothersome to use.   <comment79241> Thanks for the answer. This is close but it looks like that will only open files that don't have an extension, which is a bit limiting. Something like this that allows you to indicate which extensions to open would be perfect. <comment79260> Have you tried it? The description is a bit misleading. I've had this version installed for about a week before tossing it due to said flaws. It did what I said. <comment79587> This worked, thanks! Does have the drawbacks you mention but more often than not I'm working with text files anyways.
