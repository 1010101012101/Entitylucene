What are the default chrome://flags/ enabled on OSX? <body> For security reasons, I started disabling chrome://flags/ on my OSX laptop, but realize that certain videos look choppy when I disabled the flags, I'd like to re enable the default ones.  What flags are enabled/disabled by default in chrome?  <answer90871> Here is a PDF of my chrome://flags/ page. This is from Chrome version 26.0.1410.65, with barely any usage on my part (I primarily use Safari).  <comment227976> Link is dead. :(
