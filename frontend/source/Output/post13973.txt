Safari is not showing style sheets <body> For some reason, starting yesterday, Safari will not show ANY style sheets for any webpage I visit.  I updated today to Safari 5.0.5 thinking that might help, but it didn't.  I restarted, and that didn't help either.  Here's an example of what it looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzxTJ.jpg" alt="image1"  I am not running extensions or any custom style sheets.  I did notice something odd with the extensions section of the safari preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QpM6k.jpg" alt="image2"  Any ideas / suggestions?  <answer13974> You could try recreating your Safari Preferences plist:  ol liQuit Safari./li liOpen Finder - Library - Preferences/li liMove com.apple.Safari.plist to your Desktop./li liOpen Safari./li /ol  <comment15544> Thank you Tricon, it seems to have worked! <comment15588> Glad I could help!
