Stop Safari from restoring default preferences after quitting <body> Every time that I quit Safari, it restores all default preferences. It also resets the homepage to the default apple.com site! (I cannot stand this.) This problem began after installing McAfee, and persists even after I uninstalled it by using their un-installer.   This problem is happening on both my iMac and MacBook Pro. It started while Mountain Lion was installed and still after installing Mavericks. Any insight would be helpful to prevent this.
