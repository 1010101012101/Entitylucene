Menu Bar Maintenance <body> I grow weary of all of the icons running in my menu bar. At this point, most of the menus on the left side are overlapped by icons from the right. Is there a good app for fixing this? I know I can drag the system ones off to the desktop and delete them, but installed apps are another story.   <answer99655> You need Bartender, which allows you to control what displays where in the menu bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I4gRn.jpg" alt="Bartender Menu Bar"     h3Organize your menu bar apps/h3      ul   liLets you tidy your menu bar apps how you want./li   liSee your menu bar apps when you want./li   liHide the apps you need to run, but do not need to see./li   liHave the clean looking menu bar you want./li   liRearrange your menu bar items as you wish./li   /ul
