OSX Mail - deleting imap email without deleting on gmail server <body> I am using Mail.app to access my gmail account (business / google apps email).   I want to delete a big pile of emails in Mail to clean up my inbox, but I want to keep those emails in gmail (IMAP server) so I look them up in the future by logging directly into gmail.   I'm new to Mail. Is there a setting where I can delete my emails in this account freely in Mail without deleting them at all from the gmail?  <answer243252> You can check codeMailbox Behaviors/code in your Gmail account setting (under codeAccounts/code) and check codeStore deleted messages on the server/code. This will make your messages still available in other clients even if you delete them in the Mac where you have this setting.  Reference: Mail (El Capitan): Mailbox Behaviors preferences
