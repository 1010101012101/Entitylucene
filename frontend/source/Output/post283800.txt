LG 5k display as docking station for multiple MacBooks <body> Is it possible to connect an Apple mouse and keyboard to the LG UltraFine 5k display via Bluetooth, and then interchangeably connect separate MacBook Pro's to the display without have to reconnect the keyboard and mouse to them?  I have separate MacBook Pro's for personal and work, and I'm hoping the display itself can serve as a docking station. As soon as I connect the computer to the display via Thunderbolt, I'm hoping that the keyboard and mouse are automatically able to control the computer.  <answer283811> h2LG Display has no bluetooth/h2  The LG UltraFine 5K Display has no bluetooth connectivity. Thus you cannot connect bluetooth peripherals to it.  h2Pairing the mouse/keyboard/h2  You can connect an Apple Magic Mouse 2 and Apple Magic Keyboard to a MacBook via Bluetooth and/or using a Lightning cable.  You may need to buy a USB-A to USB-C adapter to connect them.  h2A possible solution/h2  Both devices need to paired every time you want to use them with different computers/MacBooks. You can, however, leave the Lightning cables attached. If they are connected to a MacBook running macOS 10.12 or later they will pair instantly it. After that you may disconnect the cable or leave it attached (keyboard/trackpad only).  ul liConnect the keyboard and mouse using the Lightning cable to a display with a USB-C Dock/li liConnect the display and your MacBook using a USB-C cable/li /ul  If you choose to replace the Magic Mouse 2 with a Magic Trackpad you may leave the cables attached all the time.  <comment357885> Don't know why I thought the LG monitor had Bluetooth connectivity...
