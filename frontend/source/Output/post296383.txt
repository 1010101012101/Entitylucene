Lost 80GB of space by deleting the bootcamp partition on macOS Sierra <body> I have deleted the bootcamp partition and there was a logical volume created, which I have erased using codediskutil eraseVolume free %noformat% disk0s2/code and codediskutil cs revert UUID/code commands, Now I have lost the partition and it doesn't show up in codediskutil list/code or codediskutil cs list/code neither in recovery nor in macOS. How can I retrieve this space?  precodediskutil list  /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            418.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Apple_KernelCoreDump                         789.6 MB   disk0s4  diskutil cs list No CoreStorage logical volume groups found /code/pre  <comment374341> Do you have a backup of the Macintosh HD data just in case you need to wipe and start over (or if you enter a command someone thinks is safe and it erases your data or is mis-typed)? <comment374349> I don't have a backup of Macintosh HD
