Letters in Xcode Project Navigator <body> I want to know the meaning of the letters in the project navigator in Xcode; (Ms &amp; A) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Wwss.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer19203> These are for source control. M stands for Modified. A stands for Added. This is so you know what files have changed since the last commit of your project.  It's all explained on this support page http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode4UserGuide/SCM/SCM.html  <comment21029> Thx, I never thought it had to do with repositories lol we use a third party one XD
