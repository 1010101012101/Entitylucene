What port is this? <body> Questions:  ol liIs the display plug in the following picture indeed a Mini-DVI?/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vv3Ou.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liWould this cable work? (I would use a regular DVI Male to Male with it)?/li /ol  Why? My friend wants to connect her Mac (iMac I think) to her TV. I'm thinking I need a Mini-DVI (male) to HDMI (or DVI) and a separate 3.5mm Male to Male for sound.  <answer93362> Actually it is called a MINI-DVI (not Midi as in the first part of your question), but yes it is.     I believe this is a white iMac, these had Mini-DVI (the first Alu iMacs also had Mini-DVI).  This changed just around 2011 with the 2nd Generation of alu iMacs (display port) and the latest generation (Thunderbolt).  See here for details and comparision and see this schematic:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Ayhp.png" alt="enter image description here"  .  Not sure about that cable from your link though, because to me it looks like a HDMI socket.  However, below is typical monitor (or TV) female DVI input socket:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ITBZX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  .  I would rather expect you to buy this adaptor, which would make the socket similar to any PC video card and then use a normal DVI-DVI cable that would be used to go from a regular DVI video card to the Monitor/TV (I think this is what you mean by "DVI Male to Male").  If your friend's TV has VGA in, there is a VGA version too (link).  Regarding sound, a TV most likely has cinch input for sound (as in the picture above). There are many solutions for 3.5mm-stereo - cinch (e.g. this).  <comment109604> Thanks @Nicholaz! I had my friend buy the Mini-DVI to DVI Female, a DVI (male to male) and a 3.5mm to RCA (she'll plug directly in her sound system rather than TV). <comment139992> **Important update!** The Mini-DVI to DVI female (see my last comment) did not work. Not sure why. Maybe it has to do with DVI-I vs DVI-D. I'm not sure. What ended up working was the Mini-DVI to VGA (if you don't mind analog vs digital)
