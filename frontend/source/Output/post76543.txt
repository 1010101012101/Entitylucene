How do I change the hotkey combo to lock the screen <body> On my Macbook pro (OS X 10.8.2) the hotkey combo to lock he screen is Ctrl+Shift+Eject.    I don't like that combination at all.  I'd like to make it Ctrl+Command+l is there some way to do this?  <answer76553> I would suggest :   ol liCreate a new service with automator with a "Run Shell Script" /li liHere the script code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend/code/li liBind this new service to a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences » Keyboard » pane Keyboard Shortcuts/li /ol  Edit : This post on SuperUser explains it better than me.   <answer76563> Using KeyRemap4MacBook, you could add this to private.xml:  code&lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::L, VK_CONTROL | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;/code  <comment89451> I installed KeyRemap4MacBook.  I added this to private.xml.  I rebooted.  However it doesn't seem to do anything.  No new options appear and Ctrl+Command+l does nothing. <comment89453> Ok so I found the problem. Your code is incomplete.  You need a buch of other xml stuff  ?xml version="1.0"? root  itemnameLock Screen with Ctrl+Command+l/name identifierprivate.locksreen/identifier --KeyToKey-- KeyCode::L, VK_CONTROL | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT/autogen /item /root
