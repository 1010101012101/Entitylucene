You should be able to finish the update process after you've done that.  <comment67914> Is it possible that you haven't installed the Xcode command line tools on ML yet? I think MacPorts depends on those. <comment67920> Adding to Nathan Greenstein's answer: Check this: https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration: Migrating a MacPorts install to a new major OS version or CPU architecture <comment122777> Nathan Greenstein answered you 14 months ago... please click Accept.
