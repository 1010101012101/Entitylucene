Mirror desktop items on two monitors <body> I don't want to mirror my monitors but I would like the files in ~/Desktop to display on both. Right now they only display on my primary monitor. Is it possible?  <answer239091> You can't make items appear twice on what is essentially the same desktop, but you can view the contents of your desktop as a folder.  The simplest method using default settings is to open a new folder in Finder, kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd N /kbd , then Desktop should be one of the Favourites on the Sidebar.
