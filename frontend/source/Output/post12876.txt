Searching in every contact field in iPhone <body> I am looking for an app that is able to search a string in every fields of my contacts on the iPhone (same as in outlook).  <answer12922> Try Contact Find by Piet Jonas in the App Store or Fast Contacts by SpiceLoop also on the App Store.  <answer16400> Try FindNDialEG.  It says it can search any string.  <comment13510> In Address Book contacts ??? <comment13511> Do you just want to search a contact on your iPhone ? You are aware that if you scroll to the left in Springboard (the "app overview") you'll end up in a search window which among other things, also searches your contacts ? <comment13512> iphone search find only the name and nothing else. <comment13603> yet for another app that should be just a built in feature... <comment84041> That app hasn't gotten a single review and no stars. Has anyone actually used it?
