How do I view the page source in Safari just like I can in Windows Internet Explorer? <body> I'm experienced with Windows, not so much with Mac. In Windows Internet Explorer I can go to the View menu and select Source as in to “view source”. This opens a window showing me the html code of the page I am visiting, just like in the screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fBkyH.png" alt="enter image description here"  On my Mac I looked in Safari's View menu and all the other menus and do not see anything resembling this option.  strongHow can I do the same thing on Safari in macOS?/strong  <answer285673> The option is available in Safari, but it’s not on by default. To activate this, follow the steps below:  ol liLaunch Safari/li liGo to Safari  Preferences (or just use the kbdcommand/kbdkbd,/kbd shortcut)/li liClick on the Advance tab in the Toolbar (it emshould/em be the last one)/li liAt the very bottom tick the checkbox for emShow Develop menu in menu bar/em /li liExit the Preferences window/li /ol  Now you’ll see a new Develop menu in the menu bar. This will give you access to a whole heap of options, including strongShow Page Source/strong. It may be worth you exploring the various options to see what else you can make use of.  strong[EDIT]/strong  I forgot to mention, once you've enabled the Develop menu, you will be able to also right-click on any page and choose emShow Page Source/em from the menu that appears.
