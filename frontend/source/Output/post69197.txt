My Wife's Calendar icon is transparent both in the dock and in Launchpad <body> She's running OSX Mountain Lion, latest updates, on a 2012 MacBook Air 11"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ENY2m.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've searched quite a bit and had no luck. We've rebooted (obviously) and removed the calendar from the dock but it didn't help (as the calendar icon itself seems to me borked).  Weird!  <comment80369> Command + click on the Calendar icon. Right click on the app and select view package contents. Go to Contents  Resources. Check if there is a “App-empty.icns” file. Report back. <comment80762> The file was there. We ran "repair disk permissions" and rebooted and that seems to have cleared it up. <comment80786> Good! Permission repairs usually solve problems where files exist but are not being used.
