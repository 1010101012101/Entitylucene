How Jaicolder works? <body> I'v used the Jailcoder:  http://oneiros.altervista.org/jailcoder/  To put app on Jailbroken iPad, but I wonder how it works?   How Apple verify that someone bought their 99$/year program. How those certificates works? How JailCoder make it work with Jailbroken devices ?   <comment116517> Basically, Apple uses RSA keys, and non jailbroken iOS devices spend a lot of time contacting Apple's servers and verifying that things are signed with a valid, purchased key. <comment119507> It's self-signing. If you have AppSync, you can do this out-of-the-box without any third-party software (one of the very few legal uses for AppSync, actually).
