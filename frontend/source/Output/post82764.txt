Is there a web browser I can use safely on Mac OS 10.5.8? <body> Sometime in 2012, Adobe Flash asked me to update it. I tried, but it didn't work because my browsers (firefox and chrome) didn't support the newest flash. I tried to update my browsers, but neither firefox nor chrome supports mac os 10.5.8 anymore. Safari keeps telling me to update flash too. I know that using an older version of flash can be a security hazard, so I really want to update.  My question: Are there any browsers (perhaps a firefox variant) I can use more safely now than the browsers that shipped with 10.5.8?  <answer82790> emFor the impatient:/em   You have two possibilities:  ul liPowerPC-based Mac: TenFourFox and no Flash./li liIntel-based Mac: Opera (thanks to Cybermatatu for this one!) with  older Flash 10.3 (beware, Flash 10.3 is an archived version and is no longer supported nor updated with security fixes by Adobe)./li /ul  emLong version:/em  ul liIf you use an Intel processor you can use Opera:     Opera 12       OS X Leopard (10.5), or greater: 32-bit and 64-bit Intel   systems supported   Opera supports Flash Player plug-in./li liIf you use a PowerPC processor you may want to try TenFourFox. TenFourFox seems to be actively developed (version 17.0.3 was released Feb 16 2013). TenFourFox supports add-ons, but not plugins, that is, strongyou can't use Flash at all/strong./li /ul  Please notice that Flash Player 11 only supports 10.6 and newer. You can still download version 10.3 for 10.5 Intel (beware, Flash 10.3 is an archived version and is no longer supported nor updated with security fixes by Adobe).  As for other browsers:  ul listrongFirefox/strong no longer supports PowerPC processors (PowerBook, PowerMac):     Firefox 3.6.28 is the last version of Firefox that works with Mac OS X   10.4 (Tiger) or with Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) on a computer with a PowerPC processor.   Firefox 16 is the latest version that supports Leopard on Intel-based Macs as Firefox 17 requires 10.6 or newer./li liApple no longer releases strongSafari/strong updates for Mac OS X 10.5 (as stated here)./li listrongChrome/strong doesn't support Leopard, either:     Google Chrome on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) will stop receiving any   updates following Chrome 21. /li /ul  <answer82791> You should try opera Opera 12 download it fast and works well.  Caveat:  Opera only works on Macs with Intel-based processors.  If you have a PowerPC chip (G5), good luck.  Opera 12 won't work.  <answer90273> I really like the following 2 browsers.  They work even on 10.4.11  ul liOmniWeb/li liCamino/li /ul  <answer101423> I have had some success in a Flash-less world by using Safari, and enabling the strongDevelop/strong menu. Then when I get to a page that requires Flash, I can set the User Agent to report as an iPad and I will get videos streamed in a QuickTime player rather than Flash-based.  <answer104606> SeaMonkey. Still works with my old Salad bowl PPC iMac (1 GHz, 768 MB RAM), and supports flash.  <answer104626> The build requirements for firefox indicate that it should build on your setup. Might be worth a try.  Anyway going without flash is definetly the future.   <answer128707> Google Chrome v15 still works on Intel Leopard 10.5.8, IF, you can find a copy.. PS.. I'm using it now.  <comment95464> +1: Didn't know Opera 12 supported 10.5. <comment105960> Can you add some details about thinks you especially like and which make these browsers stand out? <comment119380> PowerPC or Intel? <comment119381> [Adobe Technical Support doesn't provide support for installation or use](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/archived-flash-player-versions.html) of archived versions of Flash Player. As I read Adobe's page: whilst Flash Player 10.3.183.90 (the *software*) supports Mac OS X 10.5, Adobe (the *developer*) does not. Without that support from Adobe, I should not treat use of outdated Flash Player as safe. <comment119394> I seem to remember that back in February (when I first answered the question) the article linked (http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/find-version-flash-player.html) listed a Flash Player for Mac OS X 10.5.x. So I inferred that Adobe supported that Flash version too. However, since it wasn't stated explicitely, I chose the wording "which seems to be supported by Adobe". That's clearly no longer the case (extended support for Flash Player 10.3 expired on July 9th, as explained in the link your provided), thanks for pointing it out, I've edited my answer accordingly. <comment119537> Thanks, and sorry! I had overlooked the extended support aspect; didn't realise that the 10.3.x series was updated as recently as 2013-07-09! <comment119632> Camino is no longer being developed, unfortunately. I, too, recommend OmniWeb.
