Messages: Setting to Always Display Time Stamp? <body> Is it possible to display the Time Stamp of messages by default in both the Desktop Messages app, and the mobile app?   This is the default view:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MnR8n.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Obviously, the time stamps are viewable by hovering the mouse over a message for the desktop version, or swiping left in the mobile app.    But having them always displayed without the mouseover popup like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ju7c8.png" alt="enter image description here"  http://www.macissues.com/2014/04/28/view-timestamps-in-messages-on-your-mac-and-iphone/  Would make far more sense. There doesn't seem to be a setting to always show the time stamp in either Messages.App or Messages for iOS, and I'm aware this doesn't seem to be an Apple-supported option, but perhaps it would be achievable through Terminal or an add-in.  <answer192416> They are displayed by default, as well in the left navigation panel as in the messages list on the right side....  <comment229603> That shows when the most recent message was delivered. To view when each message was delivered, you must: "hover the mouse over a message for the desktop version, or swipe left in the mobile app."
