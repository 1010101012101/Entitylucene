How can I permanently remove "Person 1" as User and properly continue as left off in MacOS Sierra? <body> Chrome keeps recreating Person 1 even after I delete it. It also opens up Chrome on a new google tab in Person 1's name. I have to switch to my account to get the tabs I left off at. I do have Settings - On Startup - Continue Where I left off turned on. I'm closing Chrome with Command + Q as is the proper way but reopening still occurs in the new window with the suddenly revived Person 1. How can I properly kill Person 1?   I attempted to find User Data in Users - Computer - Library - Application Support - Google - Chrome but I can't seem to determine what's the root of the revival.  Google Chrome Help Forum  how-to-enable-chromes-continue-where-you-left-off-for-os-x-el-capitan  These links seemed helpful but I've gotten stuck.
