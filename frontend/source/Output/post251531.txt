How can I configure OS X to mimick the double press spacebar function from iOS? <body> I have grown to love the double press space for a full stop, especially when using a keyboard with my iPad.  Is there any way I can enable this in OS X?  <answer251638>    It can be done, though this workaround doesn't function exactly the same as on an iOS device.       ul   liIn "System Preferences" find "Language &amp; Text" and select "Text"/li   liAdd a new rule where " " (double space) is replaced with ". " (period space)./li   /ul      -Enable "Symbol and Text Substitution"       -Check this new rule      *it works most places, but not everywhere, you need to start typing again for the period to show up in some cases.
