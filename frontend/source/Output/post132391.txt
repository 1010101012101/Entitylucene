Problem Syncing Between iPhone and iPad <body> I just got an iPhone recently — previously I owned iPad and iPod. I tried to sync the the contacts that was on the iPad to the iPhone, but the contacts were not synced properly (I see no contacts on my iPhone).  I run iTunes on PC, but I realize that is no contacts available despite that I’ve synced my iPad to the computer. The iPad still has the contacts.  I guess that syncing iPhone to iTunes might have wiped out the contacts. I want to make sure that the contacts on iPad is properly saved to iCloud, and the contacts can be synced to the new iPhone.  <comment155684> Go to https://www.icloud.com . Sign in. Under contacts, are your contacts there?
