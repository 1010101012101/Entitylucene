User account creation date time? <body> I am using a shared mac in which a new user account was created by another user.  I want to know the dateTime of the account creation.  Is there a way to find it out without asking the peer?  <answer141620> A quick way to do it would be to go to the directory   precode/Users /code/pre  And add the Date Created option via the View Options  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ABUWY.png" alt="view options"  This assumes that the home directory was created at the same time of account itself  <comment166880> Great!!
