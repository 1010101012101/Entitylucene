VGA No Signal with P2JR Pico Projector <body> I have a late 2008 unibody Macbook running OSX Mavericks and I'm trying to hook it up to a P2JR Pico Projector.  I'm using the cable supplied with the projector and the official MiniDP to VGA adapter. When I plug the cable in both sides, the Macbook registers that a VGA screen has been plugged in, and switches resolution etc. But the projector will only display No Signal when switched to the VGA channel.  Any ideas?  <comment145792> It shouldn't matter what app - It's just a second screen. <comment145793> OK, I missed that it shows as second display in system preferences. Try using ColorSync app on your Mac (if you have one) and work your way true its features.
