Flashing Folder on Mac Pro 1,1 after trying to Bootcamp <body> So I bought a Mac 1,1 and it runs great, until I tried to bootcamp it the other day with an old windows HDD i had. I downloaded windows, and tried to bootcamp it and now it will not boot the Mac HDD, but if I hold option on boot the HDD shows up and then i can boot into it. I am on OSX Lion.   <answer146522> You probably killed the boot sector for the OS X.  Use the CMD-R to restore the OSX.  <comment172638> okay. will that affect the programs i currently have installed or will those be unaffected. <comment172640> NOPE, it will only repair the OS X it self, no apps will be impacted. <comment172643> awesome. thanks. <comment172644> also, bootcamp refuses to work with windows 7 32bit on a USB stick. any thoughts? <comment172645> sorry, that would be a new question :) <comment172653> =P fine. lol ill ask another
