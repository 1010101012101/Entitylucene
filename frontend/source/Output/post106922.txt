Safari going nuts in Mavericks - iMac totally unresponsive <body> Is anybody else experiencing Safari going crazy on Mavericks? I have just unlocked my iMac (Model 2012, 12GB RAM, 2TB HDD, Core i7 3.4GHz) and everything was slow motion. The hard disk was spinning constantly. After five minutes, Activity Monitor finally showed up (see 1st picture). Nothing too special there, only the 46GB virtual memory makes me wonder a bit and of course there's immense memory pressure. Then I started shutting down apps one after the other. Finally, it was Safari's turn and immediately, memory pressure started dropping. See 2nd picture. I can see Safari hogging 1.13GB of RAM but that's not too much, is it? I had three tabs open, all of them just plain HTML. No Flash, no videos. This has never happened before with all the various Lions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/27uto.png" alt="Before closing Safari" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/My4vm.png" alt="After closing Safari"
