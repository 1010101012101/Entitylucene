Which countries can an individual iOS developer reside in in order to receive payments from Apple? <body> I want to sign up as an individual or as a company and sell apps on the App Store. SInce I have not purchased access to Developer Program I cannot check which countries are eligible..Any other way I can check this?  <answer164012> Apple sells the developer program from the online stores in these countries:  http://store.apple.com/us/browse/open/country_selector  You could strongassume that if the developer program is for sale on your country's specific Apple online store, then you are good to go/strong as far as selling apps from that country to anywhere Apple sells apps. I've not heard of anyone having issues, but maybe there are some bizarre edge cases where you can't sell apps everywhere if you are registered in a specific country.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z0XaZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also, each country has local pre-sales support, so you can contact them before ordering if you have reservations about proceeding with payment. They will get you a specific answer if you ask. Lastly, You can even pay for the developer program and then you get to review the terms and conditions. If they are not to your liking, the developer support phone number and contact information is available to you to request a refund which you could figure out within a week or two of reviewing the T&amp;C.   <answer164013> If you can get hold of a developer license for that country, then as long as your bank account details are valid and Apple support the currency then you should be able to sell your Apps and be paid. However you should contact the local apple online store for your country and ask them if you are concerned about payment systems.  Much of the sales details are available without needing a log in or to receive the actual license agreement. For instance, take a look at the Apple Store Territories list - the list of countries that apple will support.  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/AppStoreTerritories.html  Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4804369/official-list-of-countries-for-iphone-appstore-and-in-app-purchase?lq=1  Below is the (somewhat lengthy) list of countries:     ul   liCountry code Country/li   liAE United Arab Emirates/li   liAG Antigua and Barbuda/li   liAI Anguilla/li   liAL Albania/li   liAM Armenia/li   liAO Angola/li   liAR Argentina/li   liAT Austria/li   liAU Australia/li   liAZ Azerbaijan/li   liBB Barbados/li   liBE Belgium/li   liBF Burkina Faso/li   liBG Bulgaria/li   liBH Bahrain/li   liBJ Benin/li   liBM Bermuda/li   liBN Brunei/li   liBO Bolivia/li   liBR Brazil/li   liBS Bahamas/li   liBT Bhutan/li   liBW Botswana/li   liBY Belarus/li   liBZ Belize/li   liCA Canada/li   liCG Republic Of Congo/li   liCH Switzerland/li   liCL Chile/li   liCN China/li   liCO Colombia/li   liCR Costa Rica/li   liCV Cape Verde/li   liCY Cyprus/li   liCZ Czech Republic/li   liDE Germany/li   liDK Denmark/li   liDM Dominica/li   liDO Dominican Republic/li   liDZ Algeria/li   liEC Ecuador/li   liEE Estonia/li   liEG Egypt/li   liES Spain/li   liFI Finland/li   liFJ Fiji/li   liFM Federated States Of Micronesia/li   liFR France/li   liGB United Kingdom/li   liGD Grenada/li   liGH Ghana/li   liGM Gambia/li   liGR Greece/li   liGT Guatemala/li   liGW Guinea-Bissau/li   liGY Guyana/li   liHK Hong Kong/li   liHN Honduras/li   liHR Croatia/li   liHU Hungary/li   liID Indonesia/li   liIE Ireland/li   liIL Israel/li   liIN India/li   liIS Iceland/li   liIT Italy/li   liJM Jamaica/li   liJO Jordan/li   liJP Japan/li   liKE Kenya/li   liKG Kyrgyzstan/li   liKH Cambodia/li   liKN St. Kitts and Nevis/li   liKR Republic Of Korea/li   liKW Kuwait/li   liKY Cayman Islands/li   liKZ Kazakstan/li   liLA Lao People’s Democratic Republic/li   liLB Lebanon/li   liLC St. Lucia/li   liLK Sri Lanka/li   liLR Liberia/li   liLT Lithuania/li   liLU Luxembourg/li   liLV Latvia/li   liMD Republic Of Moldova/li   liMG Madagascar/li   liMK Macedonia/li   liML Mali/li   liMN Mongolia/li   liMO Macau/li   liMR Mauritania/li   liMS Montserrat/li   liMT Malta/li   liMU Mauritius/li   liMW Malawi/li   liMX Mexico/li   liMY Malaysia/li   liMZ Mozambique/li   liNA Namibia/li   liNE Niger/li   liNG Nigeria/li   liNI Nicaragua/li   liNL Netherlands/li   liNO Norway/li   liNP Nepal/li   liNZ New Zealand/li   liOM Oman/li   liPA Panama/li   liPE Peru/li   liPG Papua New Guinea/li   liPH Philippines/li   liPK Pakistan/li   liPL Poland/li   liPT Portugal/li   liPW Palau/li   liPY Paraguay/li   liQA Qatar/li   liRO Romania/li   liRU Russia/li   liSA Saudi Arabia/li   liSB Solomon Islands/li   liSC Seychelles/li   liSE Sweden/li   liSG Singapore/li   liSI Slovenia/li   liSK Slovakia/li   liSL Sierra Leone/li   liSN Senegal/li   liSR Suriname/li   liST Sao Tome and Principe/li   liSV El Salvador/li   liSZ Swaziland/li   liTC Turks and Caicos/li   liTD Chad/li   liTH Thailand/li   liTJ Tajikistan/li   liTM Turkmenistan/li   liTN Tunisia/li   liTR Turkey/li   liTT Trinidad and Tobago/li   liTW Taiwan/li   liTZ Tanzania/li   liUA Ukraine/li   liUG Uganda/li   liUS United States/li   liUY Uruguay/li   liUZ Uzbekistan/li   liVC St. Vincent and The Grenadines/li   liVE Venezuela/li   liVG British Virgin Islands/li   liVN Vietnam/li   liYE Yemen/li   liZA South Africa/li   liZW Zimbabwe/li   /ul   <answer164016> You can't sign in as an individual or company from at least 5 countries (as of today: Dec 29, 2014):   as consequence of complete embargos:  ul liNorth Korea/li liSyria/li liCuba/li liSudan/li /ul     PROHIBITED DESTINATIONS   The U.S. holds complete embargoes against Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.      The exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a U.S. person wherever located, of any Apple goods, software, technology (including technical data), or services to any of these countries is strictly prohibited without prior authorization by the U.S. Government.    ul liIran /li /ul     OFAC IRANIAN GENERAL LICENSE NO.

General License No. D-1 enumerates certain categories authorized for export to non-prohibited end-users and end-uses in Iran. Some Apple goods and Apple software fall into these categories.

Source 1br Source 2: I checked my apple dev account and the listed countries  <comment192176> Just want to add, _anyone_ can receive payments for an app as long as their bank account information gets verified. _Selling_ those apps are restricted to the territories Apple support <comment192177> @soulshined I would qualify your "anyone can receive payments" to "anyone that Apple sells a developer program to and then has their legal paperwork accepted" :-) <comment192178> Great links - these all seem more appropriate once the OP has a) been sold a developer license and b) had their legal paperwork cleared. The list of countries where you can **buy** yourself a developer license is clearly less than the list of countries where iOS apps are for sale from your list above. <comment192179> True. The question isn't very clear. It implies that they can get hold of a developer license but not sure about the payment system from apple. <comment192180> touché. What does $99 ___really___ buy anyways. <comment192181> I actually love the clarity of the question. It's short, sweet and to-the-point. It's hard to answer well, but that doesn't make it unclear to me. I'm also not the only one to decide :-) If it's unclear you many, it might need an edit. I upvoted it as it stands with the minor tag edit I made. <comment192182> It's somewhat unclear to me because the title is referring to Apple paying the person in that country but the text is referring to the developer license. <comment192334> Thank you so much! Also a huge thanks to @bmike and everyone else who answered! Now I have to research what it takes to disburse funds that have been received to the bank account. <comment192394> Also [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151037/) has a similar answer to mine here.
