Permission denied error when opening Terminal <body> I'm using a clean install of 10.8. I wanted to add a couple of directories to my path. I tried adding them to /etc/paths using   precodesudo vim /etc/paths /code/pre  Now when I open a terminal window I see this:  precodeLast login: Wed Jan 23 15:42:57 on ttys001 /etc/paths: Permission denied pcp067952pcs:~ myLoginName$ /code/pre  This doesn't affect usability, however it is something I would prefer to fix.  Any ideas? -Austin  <answer79812> solved by repairing permissions, thanks to jakebird451 and Mark in the comments above  i'm not sure is sudo is necessary, however this worked to fix it  precodesudo chmod 0644 /etc/paths /code/pre  thanks!  <comment92085> I believe you changed the permissions by editing the path with root privileges. My privileges for that file are `-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  105 Jun 26  2012 /etc/paths` I hope this helps. Good luck. <comment92086> Check by seeing what `ls -l /etc/paths` gives <comment92095> oh! yeah i totally messed that up. i think i chmodded it to 0400. mine says -r--------  1 root  wheel  45 Jan 23 15:43 /etc/paths.
