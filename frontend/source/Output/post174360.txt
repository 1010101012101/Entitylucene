how do you backup iphone when some of the apps have the old style appleid? <body> i have an iphone 4s.  some of my apps where installed with my original apple id from years ago. at some point apple required/changed everyone to use email as their apple id.  Now when i try and back up my phone it asks for password, but it never succeeds because of the mismatched appleids. i cannot complete a backup in itunes.  anyone elese run into this issue?  <answer174362> I ran into this issue before and the way I got it fixed was by resetting the password to the apple id.  <answer194794> Have you tried HT201272 app store download ID incorrect (does not match settings ID)? (In short: Logout on your iPhone then re-sync via cable with iTunes)  <comment205300> but there are 2 appleids at play. the older not an email type and the new email <comment205331> what things  did you use the old if for? <comment231760> You don't have the password of the old Apple ID?
