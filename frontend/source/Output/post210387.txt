running python script of global keyboard shortcut in OSx <body> Hi I wrote a python script to get the size of the file of which I have URL I copied from browser or anywhere; I wanted to create a global keyboard shortcut so I tried to create using Automator  Service  Run a shell Script and selected code\usr\bin\python/code  and pasted the below script to execute:  precodefrom pySan import utils import Tkinter as tk import urllib import os import sys  def main():          root = tk.Tk()         root.withdraw()           # get text from clipboard         data =  root.clipboard_get()          if not data:                 print "nothing in clipboard to get file size."                 return          site = urllib.urlopen(data)         meta = site.info()          if meta.keys():                 contentLength = meta.get("Content-Length", None)                 if not contentLength:                         print "Failed to retrieve or no data available for size"                         return                 length = int(contentLength)                 print "Size of %s: %s " % (os.path.basename(data), ''.join(utils.sizeof(length)) )                 sys.exit(1)   if __name__ == '__main__':         main() /code/pre  but it seems to give error, workflow failed. what am I doing wrong .  <comment253921> Did your really select \usr\bin\python or was it /usr/bin/python <comment254033> I probably misstyped in SE, as I didnt copied pasted exactly from Automator's window.
