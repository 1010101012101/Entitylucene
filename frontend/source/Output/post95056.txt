Unfortunately Sparrow development stopped last year with aquisition from Google.  Alternative is Airmail new client, that takes a lot from Sparrow, but is actively developed.  <answer95125> I recommend Airmail, it's what I currently use :D  <answer115150> I like thunderbird. That's all :)br Very nice that mozilla place os x version.br Why thunderbird?br Because it have many features of good mail browser and good rss reader. Also it can be used as calender browser.  Here take a look on the mozilla thunderbird  <comment111462> Which email clients have you tried so far? <comment111550> Can you share some more details about this app, especially comparing it's features with the list of requirements stated in the question? I just had a quick look at the webpage and it seems that neither PGP nor Exchange are supported. <comment111551> http://feedback.airmailapp.info/forums/191953-airmail-beta/suggestions/3612318-support-email-encryption-s-mime-and-pgp- <comment134784> jaume, he already stated what he tested. @OP what do you mean by "You cannot do anything else when writing an email. Seriously?!"? <comment135455> @napcae - in OS X mail, if you have a compose window open, you cannot browse your inbox or read other e-mails until you close it. <comment135707> That's certainly not true. It works perfectly fine for me. I can browse and read mails, while writing another.
