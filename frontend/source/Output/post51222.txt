Why does running afconvert result in error -43 <body> I am trying to use afconvert to convert a .mp3 to .m4r. I am entering the following:  precodeafconvert -f m4af -d aac -o input.mp3 tone.m4r /code/pre  However, this gives me an error:  precodeError: Couldn't open input file (-43) /code/pre  I am in the directory of the input file. Could someone please shed some light on what I am doing wrong?  <answer51223> Drop the code-o/code flag, I think. You are specifying codeinput.mp3/code as an output file, and then codetone.m4r/code becomes the input file. See the output of codeafconvert -h/code.  <answer51224> I tried to run codeafconvert -f m4af -d aac -o output.aac input.mp3/code and it worked perfectly. And according to the man page, it probably isn't beneficial or necessary to use the code-o/code flag, just codeafconvert -f m4af -d aac input.mp3 output.aac/code would be fine also.  Have you checked the permissions? I tried to codechmod 000 input.mp3/code the file and subsequently rerun your command and it returned the same error. Try to run codefile input.mp3/code and see if other Unix utilities can read that file. If so, I guess the problem is just that the error description from afconvert is not clear enough. And its man page seems to be badly written.
