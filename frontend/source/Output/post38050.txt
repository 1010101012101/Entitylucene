OS X Lion Fullscreen App's Menu Bar - Increase wait time? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Add a delay to menubar dropdown in fullscreen apps       When you make an application full screen in Lion, you can move your cursor to the very top of the screen, wait about half a second, and the app's menu bar will pop down.   Is there any way to increase the wait time between when I move my cursor to the top of the screen and when the menu bar pops down? I find myself trying to switch tabs in Chrome and getting the menu bar to pop down by accident (so far, my only real Lion annoyance =p)
