Can't see all my photo's on Photostream iCloud iPad and iPhone <body> I'm having a problem finding my pictures taken with my iPhone 4.  When I want to see my Photostream it will only show me the pictures of my iPad and not the pictures taken with my iPhone (Photo's and screenshots).  I'm using the iCloud control panel for Windows.  Why can't I see the pictures taken with my iPhone, since my Photostream is on?  I double-checked that Photostream is enabled in my Settings on the phone. Both devices (iPhone and iPad are connected to iCloud).  <comment148437> I have the same problem. Could you solve the problem? Thanks
