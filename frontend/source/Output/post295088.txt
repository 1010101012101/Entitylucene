How to bring up the virtual keyboard on iOS when a Bluetooth keyboard is connected? <body> I often pick up my iPad and move away from its Bluetooth keyboard without turning the keyboard off. Whenever I need to type some text, I'm reminded that I can't see the virtual iOS keyboard until I either:  ul liwalk to the Bluetooth keyboard and turn it off,/li liturn off Bluetooth on my iPad, which disconnects the keyboard but also other devices like Bluetooth speakers or Apple Pencil./li /ul  Is there another, more convenient option?  (Sent from my Bluetooth-disabled iPad since I was too lazy to walk to my Bluetooth keyboard)  <answer295091> Open Bluetooth settings, disconnect from the keyboard is quicker than unpairing the keyboard entirely. If that works for your specific keyboard, you can use it - if not, youâ€™ve already got the fastest method of disabling Bluetooth entirely.  <answer295106> Long press the arrow in the keyboard menu bar (or whatever this thing is called) to bring up the keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmtIx.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <comment372538> Commenting just to note this is apparently an iPad-only feature. There seems to be no menu bar on iPhone (not even on Plus).
