App promo codes - do they renew? <body> A client of mine has generated all 100 promo codes for their app without considering that they are valid for only 28 days.  Do they ever regenerate? If I made version 2.0 of the App would that enable new promo codes?  It's just naivety on the part of the client.  Thanks,  Paul  <answer255210> They will regenerate and make the old codes invalid.  "They become invalid if a new version of the app becomes available" ... "You can request up to 100 promo codes for every version of each platform of your app"  - Apple Developer - Providing Promo Codes
