Calling an app from the terminal via script <body> I try to call an application from the console and pass it an argument. This is the script I am using:  precode#!/bin/sh  open -a "/Applications/MyApp.app/" $1 /code/pre  Somehow the OS is unhappy with this and complains:  precodeFSPathMakeRef(/Applications/MyApp.app) failed with error -43. /code/pre  What can I do?  <answer145184> That looks like /Applications/MyApp.app doesn't actually exist.   You can test for that in your script, perhaps like this:  precode#!/bin/sh APP=/Applications/MyApp.app if [ ! -d "$APP" ]; then   echo &gt;&amp;2 "$0: $APP not found."   exit 1 fi exec open -a "$APP" "$@" /code/pre  <answer145189> You can make sure the application exists before calling codeopen/code on it! Here's a quick bit of Bash to do this:  precodeif [ -d "/Applications/MyApp.app" ]; then     open -a "/Applications/MyApp.app" else     echo "Application /Applications/MyApp.app does not exist!" fi /code/pre  <comment170981> That looks like /Applications/MyApp.app doesn't actually exist.  You sure it's there? <comment171035> Thanks! That was silly. Sorry for asking, but at least I now know what error 43 means ... <comment171087> `Mac OS error -43 (fnfErr): File not found`
