IOS10 - Sharing photos - Mail option disappears when 6 photos is selected <body> I have 1 phone where the mail option disappears when 5-6 photos are selected for sharing  What I do 1. Open the photos app 2. Press Select in top right corner and select one photo 3. Press Share in the bottom left corner Here I among other options have the the option for sharing via mail 4. Add photos by selecting them in the top  When I have selected 5 or 6 photos, the mail option disappears.  Is it possible to set a restriction somewhere, that I can remove, or is it size of the photos.  I have another phone with the same setup, but different mail address, on the same domain though, and on this it doesn't happen.  <comment338501> Are both phones iPhones running iOS 10? <comment338503> Yep both using ios10 and both iphone 6 <comment338506> Using the default mail client or 3rd party app? <comment339983> the default mail app under sharing options
