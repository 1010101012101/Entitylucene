Reset your PATH variable <body> I stuffed up (basically wiped) my PATH variable.  Is there any way to reset it to the default?  I look at How do I reset the $PATH variable on Mac OS X?, but I find it very confusing.  As far as I know I stuffed up my code~/.profile/code file.  <answer11747> The file can have the name code.bash_profile/code or code.profile/code - one solution could be to rename the file e.g. codemv ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_prolile.old/code and then restart your machine and see if it helped.  You can also try to edit the file, and then maybe you'll see the wrong PATH, which you then can edit.  <answer11748> I have the following in my code~/.profile/code:  precodePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin PATH=$PATH:~/bin /code/pre  The first codePATH/code declaration overrides any existing codePATH/code setting (it doesn't include code$PATH/code). The path used is the OS X default.  The second line appends code~/bin/code to the codePATH/code and it is a personal preference, not a default.  After edit, restart your session â€” or use command codesource ~/.profile/code to activate the changes immediately.  <answer181416> In the case of logging in as a normal user and invoking codesu - root/code, I found that Mac OS X 10.8.5's bash was ignoring code.profile/code and code.bash_profile/code; I was unable to change root's code$PATH/code by editing those files.  What emdid/em work was editing code/etc/paths/code. After exiting the root shell and entering again with codesu - root/code, the new path was present.  <comment12327> Thanks a million man - everything so far has been insanely confusing - your advice is incredibly straightforward and easy to follow <comment223508> Great answer, this worked like a champ for me. <comment259369> Messing with system paths could generate instability. <comment300987> Better to use ~/.bash_profile for this simple case and in more general ~/.bashrc and source that in your ~/.bash_profile
