Schedule Mac to shut down at a certain time on certain days <body> I have a bunch of macs I use for young kids in a classroom. They're quite old so they can only run OSX 10.11 which isn't ideal but nevermind!  Anyway, I would like them to start up when the first class begins and shut down at the end of the day, but only on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.  Using the energy saving, I have been able to make it shut down with a timer, but only if other users are not logged in. If other users are logged in, it will ask for the administrator's account.  I would like it to have the 60 second count down, but not to prompt for a username and password if other users are logged in.  Is there a way to do this, along with the specific days? Thanks!
