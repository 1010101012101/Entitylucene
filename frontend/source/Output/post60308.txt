How can I fix keystroke delay while typing in Mail on Mountain Lion? <body> I have Mail Version 6.0 (1485), Mountain Lion 10.8, build 12A269.  When composing messages in Mail the keystrokes are delayed. This makes typing awkward. I have not had this happen under Lion and it does not appear to be happening under any other application.  How can I fix keystroke delay while typing in Mail on Mountain Lion?  <comment69455> Is there anything interesting in the logs / Console.app? <comment69461> Do you have any old Mail plugins installed?
