How to get rid of a second CrashPlan icon in the menu bar? <body> Everytime I restart, I get two crashplan icons in the menu bar.   If I close one of them, the other still remains.   How can I get rid of one of them?  <answer71401> This happened to me when I installed CrashPlan Mac menubar app over a year ago, and when a recent version of CrashPlan included its own menubar.
