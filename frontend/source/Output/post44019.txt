How do I import files into GarageBand on iPod touch? <body> I'm trying to import the m4a files that iTunes synchronized from the Voice Memo app, but the files are not showing up in the GarageBand app in iOS when I open it.  Any idea how to import these sound files?  <answer44076> To import audio files into Garageband for iOS, connect your iOS device to your computer. Then do the following:  h3On your computer:/h3  ol liOpen iTunes/li liClick your device in the left-hand column/li liClick "Apps" in the bar at the top of the right-hand pane/li liUnder "File Sharing" select "Garageband" in the "Apps" column/li liClick "Add..." in the bottom-right of the "GarageBand Documents" area/li liIn the dialog that opens up, select the file(s) you want to transfer over/li liOnce you've selected the file(s), it transfers over to your iOS device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DVS3j.png" width="580"/li /ol  h3On your iOS device:/h3  ol liOpen GarageBand/li liIf you're not already, switch to the multi-track view by tapping the img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/69ctr.png" alt="enter image description here" button/li liIn the upper right-hand area, you should see a loop icon with the number of newly transferred files on top of it, like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B3YAo.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liTap this icon. It brings up a screen like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ecnSU.png" width="400"/li liJust like the screen says, you can tap and hold and drag the desired audio files into your track listings. They each appear as Audio Recorder tracks:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RiQZ9.png" width="400"/li /ol  That's it!  There is one caveat: GarageBand for iOS is limited to a maximum of 320 "bars" for the length of a project, and it does not appear that it's possible to bypass this. If you need to edit audio that's longer than that, you will need to use another app.  <comment50671> Great! I wasn't finding it on the app itself, thanks! <comment50672> @Tom Glad I could help! <comment50676> Sad it will import only till the 24th second.. :/ I have an 1 hour recording I would like to edit on it. <comment50678> @TomBrito Make sure your Garageband song section length is set to "automatic" - tap that small "+" under the gear to change it. Once it's set to automatic, your entire file should be editable, assuming you have enough space on your device. <comment51611> I got more space now, but looks like the maximum of what they call "bars" is 320, and it fits just a few minutes (about 5). Maybe the only solution is to split the audio before importing... :/ <comment51632> @TomBrito Hm, you're right. Sorry, I didn't realize this limitation. <comment112060> change the tempo before adding the track, you'll get a lot more time per track.. so you won't have to split as much.
