Keep general phone installation size (incl. IOS) to a minimum <body> I just bought an iPhone 5s and will receive it soon  It only has 16gb of RAM  I will clean install IOS 8 upgrade (this is best, no?)  Will the installation files self-delete after install?  And do you know some good tricks / guides / apps to keep IOS and other install sizes to a minimum? I mean clean up and delete unnecessary files etc.  Thanks  <answer146821> Obviously, the files will auto-delete after installation. iOS has a really good file management system. There are not "tricks/guides/apps" to keep the install sizes to a minimum. This is not Android to clean up and delete unnecessary files, It's done automatically.  <comment172972> Ok, I guess I just delete apps I don't need <comment172975> A simple guide, anything downloaded from the Web that you did not use for 3 or more moths delete it, if you need it you can always get it from the web again. <comment172976> btw, if it was obvious to me that install files would auto-delete, I would not ask ;) And yes, ofc there are ways to increase space on the phone, I just don't know how.
