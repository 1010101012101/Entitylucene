Songs appear once in iTunes; listed twice on iPhone 5s (iOS 7) <body> What do I need to do to prevent the iOS 7 Music app from listing songs twice when the song should only exist once?  I sync a selection of playlists to my iPhone 5s from iTunes 11.1.5 on my iMac running OS X 10.7.5. For at least one artist, album tracks are listed twice on my iPhone despite appearing only once in my iTunes library. I count 16 duplicates out of 53 songs for this artist on my phone. (The artist is Front 242, which I mention mostly for my own reference.)  I checked my iTunes library on the iMac, and I only have one copy of the affected songs there.  I am not using iTunes Match.  Curiously, during playback, songs are not repeated if I move forwards or backwards through a list that includes duplicated songs.  strongWhat I tried/strong  In an attempt to solve this, I unchecked "Sync Music" and applied the change with my iPhone connected to my iMac, so all songs were removed. Then I checked "Sync Music" again (and thankfully my previous selection of playlists was preserved), and the music went back on my phone. Same problem.  strongWhat I didn't try/strong  I haven't tried marking either individual albums or the artist for inclusion on my phone, just one or more playlists that include these songs.  I haven't tried swiping to delete individual songs, because I'd first want to determine all of the playlists containing that song, and do a time-consuming before-and-after check on my phone to ensure that removing the apparently duplicated song doesn't change my playlists.  <answer131476> Try this to view if you really have duplicate items on your iTunes library: Click View, and than "Show Duplicate Items"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBumx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer131480> strongWhat I would try:/strong  ol liMake a current backup your iPhone via either iTunes or iCloud. /li liEject the iPhone from iTunes./li liiPhone Settings  General  Usage  Storage  Music  Edit  strongDelete/strong/li liReboot your iPhone/li liConnect your iPhone to iTunes and attempt to manually sync the playlists in question./li /ol  <answer131481> Assuming the duplicated songs were purchased from iTunes, you can go to Settings  iTunes &amp; App Store, then turn off "Show All - Music". This toggle shows all the songs you have purchased regardless of if it is on your device or not.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L4APw.png" width="320"  <answer148091> This is a known issue actually.  I have experienced similar issues many times.  When I have an issue where my iPhone playlist contents don't match my iTunes playlist contents, I do this:  ol liFor this excercise, let's say one of my Playlists is "Steely Dan", however iTunes and the Music app don't match, or the songs on my phone won't sort the same as they do on iTunes.  /li liCreate another playlist called "Steely Dan 2"./li liIn the original "Steely Dan" playlist, select all songs, click and drag to the "Steely Dan 2" playlist./li liDelete the "Steely Dan" playlist./li liRename the "Steely Dan 2" playlist to "Steely Dan"./li liPlug in your phone and sync again./li /ol  <answer150798> strongWhat I did:/strong  ol liSync your iPhone with iTunes./li liIn iTunes, click codeSummary/code and uncheck codeManually manage music and videos/code OR go to codeMusic/code and uncheck codeSync Music/code./li liWhen prompted whether you wish to proceed -- because unchecking means the current music files in your phone will be erased, which is what you want to do to resolve this problem -- click codeRemove and Sync/code./li liNext, eject the phone.

For me, the problematic tracks were no longer duplicated.  If you still find duplicates on your phone, then go to iTunes, select 'Music', then select "Show Duplicate Items" from the View pull-down menu. Here you can delete any duplicate items. If you are using iTunes 12.01, click the 'Done' button when finished viewing file duplicates. /li liRestart your iPhone and connect to computer./li liIn iTunes, click codeSummary/code.

Try disabling that and just backup on your computer. Then do it again.  <comment154473> @bneely said he/she only has one copy of the songs that are being duplicated in iTunes. <comment154478> Were these songs purchased from the iTunes Store? <comment159606> No, these songs were imported from CDs. <comment171569> What's bizarre is that I did this exact thing and it worked -- until today. Now the new version of iTunes overrode this fix and songs appear twice again. Any tips? <comment197971> I can't post an answer but I had this same issue and it seems to be caused by converting higher bitrate songs to, e.g. 128 kBs AAC. Turning this off and resyncing fixed it for me. <comment206682> Another thing to note, it is possible to view and delete songs on the device directly from iTunes.  However, to do a complete wipe and restart on the device, this method worked for me.  I also did the manual/automatic switch described in the answer below.
