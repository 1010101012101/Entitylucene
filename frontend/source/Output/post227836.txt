iPad profile from Cisco Meraki invalid <body> I just setup a bunch of iPads to get a profile from our Cisco Meraki MDM server and I am getting an error as follows in the Event log:  codename: Profile name, error: The profile "Profile Name" is invalid, status: Error/code  Have any one seen this error before?  <answer227974> Ok here was the fix.  I had to create a new Profile from scratch and then Tag it to the iPads and the profile pushed out fine.  strongBeware/strong  I originally tried to make a copy of my first profile and got the same error message above - it wasn't until I created a brand new profile from scratch it fixed the issue.  Just a bad profile I guess
