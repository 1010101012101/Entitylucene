How to use Apple TV without a working remote? <body> My Apple remote's battery died. I can get to the start screen of Apple TV by unplugging the device, but I can't seem to get further than that without the remote. That means I can't activate the Apple TV Remote app for my iPhone - I can't navigate to the activation screen.  This previous answer suggests I may be able to control Apple TV with the 1Keyboard app, but that app costs $10 and I have no reason to believe it can do what I need it to do.  Any help?  <answer212432> You can use the Remote app on an iPhone as a remote.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/remote/id284417350?mt=8  <answer212450> The OP doesn't mention if strongHome Sharing/strong was turned on in the Apple TV.

Which model Apple TV do you have? <comment255885> @bjbk model A1469 <comment255886> Is replacing the battery an option for you? If so, I'll post an answer on how to do it.  Then it will be easy enough to pair the Remote App with the ï£¿ TV.  Batteries can be purchased pretty much anywhere. <comment255887> @bjbk If I had a battery all my problems would be solved right now. <comment255888> I understand that.  But with due respect, I don't understand is why you can't go get one.  I'll try to work on a solution that does not require the Apple remote all the same.  Cheers <comment255892> Thanks @bjbk. I can get a battery tomorrow, but that's not really the problem I'm trying to solve right now. I appreciate your help. <comment256528> Thanks Richard. I'm aware of that.
