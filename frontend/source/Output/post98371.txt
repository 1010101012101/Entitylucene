MySQL (Percona) and homebrew: <body> I'm trying to run MySQL server (Percona) by codelaunchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.percona-server.plist/code and I see the following message in code/var/log/system.log/code:  precodeAug  9 01:36:14 xxx com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[253] (homebrew.mxcl.percona-server[37257]): Exited with code: 1 Aug  9 01:36:14 xxx com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[253] (homebrew.mxcl.percona-server): Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds /code/pre  If I run it manually it gives me  precode$ /usr/local/opt/percona-server/bin/mysqld_safe 130809 01:49:36 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/var/mysql/xxx.local.err'. 130809 01:49:36 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/var/mysql /usr/local/opt/percona-server/bin/mysqld_safe: line 135: /usr/local/var/mysql/xxx.local.err: Permission denied /usr/local/opt/percona-server/bin/mysqld_safe: line 172: /usr/local/var/mysql/xxx.local.err: Permission denied 130809 01:49:36 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /usr/local/var/mysql/xxx.local.pid ended /usr/local/opt/percona-server/bin/mysqld_safe: line 135: /usr/local/var/mysql/xxx.local.err: Permission denied /code/pre  Any ideas?  <answer98412> The log says it all: The script cannot write to the file code/usr/local/var/mysql/xxx.local.err/code due to insufficient permissions.  I assume the log file belongs to a dedicated mysql user while you are starting the process using your user account.  <comment115857> Well, it was stupid. I just didn't understand how to run it properly. Now it fails, but with another error. Thanks.
