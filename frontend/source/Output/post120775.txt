Make TextMate run php from a different binary, not the original php <body> I work with php and postgre, and since the stock php doesn't come with postgre I had to install a different php version.  So I installed php5 from this website: http://php-osx.liip.ch  It's a quick install, just downloaded php5 and its modules and put them in a different directory, now everything works, except the TextMate's "php run".  I couldn't find where TextMate makes the call to the php and I wanna change it, any ideas?  Thanks.  <answer128333> Under preferences, go into variables and update (or create) codeTM_PHP/code to point to your desired executable. E.g. I have code/opt/local/bin/php/code because I'm using MacPorts.  <answer262598> In my case it was /usr/local/php5/bin/php whereas 'php5' is an alias that points to the liip installation dir /usr/local/php5-5.3.29-20141019-211753. And by the way it solved my textmate line output on syntax checking on osx 10.12. Thanks a lot.   <comment140898> Have you tried setting PATH in TextMate  Preferences  Variables to `path to php5:$PATH` or similar (important is that the path to php5 is listed first), for example `/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH`?
