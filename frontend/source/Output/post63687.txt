How to automatically make Mac shutdown after Time Machine Backup <body> How can I make my Macbook automatically shutdown after a Time Machine backup?  I have a 40GB worth backup to do but I keep having to cancel it to go to bed. Would be great if I could leave it on to do it overnight.  Any suggestions of how to do this in ML?  <answer63688> Assuming you have already set a destination for your TM, you could open a shell in Terminal (or ssh in), codesudo su/code into super-user mode, then run codetmutil startbackup --block;shutdown -h now;exit/code which tells TM to begin a backup immediately, turn off the Mac, and exit the shell.  codeman tmutil/code for more info.  You could also then add this as a launchctl item or even cron it to schedule.  <answer63705> You could setup a crontab to use tmutil through the command line to do a backup and then shutdown. since shutdown requires sudo privs, you have to set your crontab up as sudo.  precodesudo crontab -e /code/pre  Enter your password and then that brings you to edit the contab file  precodeshutdown -h now /code/pre  Shutdown does exactly that but with the -h flag, it halts the system (shutdown). For the shutdown to work, this would have to be setup as an crontab under sudo  precodetmutil startbackup /code/pre  Starts the timemachine backup.    Putting it all together:  precode00 20 ** ** ** tmutil startbackup --block &amp;&amp; shutdown -h +5 /code/pre  Would do the backup at 10:00pm every day and then shutdown  <answer215562> I wanted to be able to leave an emexisting/em backup to complete, so my approach is a little different.  The codebackupd/code process seems only to be running whilst a backup is underway (and for a minute or two afterwards, from what I've observed) so I logged in as root (so that I can (a) see all users' process and (b) trigger a shutdown) and then polled for the process to finish before shutting down.  So:  precodesudo -s /code/pre  and enter your password to become root, then:  precodewhile ( ps -ef | grep 'backupd$' ); do echo "Still backing up..."; sleep 60; done; shutdown -h +1 /code/pre  to wait for codebackupd/code to finish and then shut down.  (I used codeshutdown -h +1/code instead of codeshutdown -h now/code just to be over-cautious and give it an extra minute to tidy up or whatever before shutting down.)  <comment73670> Why do you have to cancel it to go to bed? <comment73672> Because I wouldn't want my Macbook on all night incase of overheating <comment73673> Once it idles, it will go to sleep. You are overthinking this one. <comment73674> Set it to sleep even with power on after X minutes and let it run until done? <comment73676> Doesn't sleeping still use a considerable amount of power resources? <comment73679> It probably uses more power cold booting your laptop every morning than leaving it to sleep at night. <comment73691> Looking at the post by @da4 you could replace rsync with tmutil. I was unaware of their command line tool <comment197062> Be careful with this. I plugged my time machine drive in and ran this command. The time machine backup was already being prepared, so the tmutil errored out (saying a backup was in progress) and then the shutdown command was issued (which froze my laptop for some reason, I had to do a hard reset).  Trying again now with no backup being prepared, fingers crossed! <comment333230> This still works great on Mac OS Sierra, thanks!
