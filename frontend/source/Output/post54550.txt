SSD and Superdrive on Nvidia MCP79 SATA controller <body> Right now I have a codeHitachi 320GB 5400rpm/code and a codeMATSHITADVD-R UJ-868/code superdrive connected to the Nvidia MCP79 SATA controller in my MacBook Pro 5,3. The link speed of the hard disk drive is negotiated to 1.5 Gbps as, according to this answer the device is a SATA I (1.5Gbps) device.br This is what my system profiler says about the SATA controller:   precodeVendor:                 NVidia Product:                MCP79 AHCI Link Speed:             3 Gigabit Negotiated Link Speed:  1.5 Gigabit Description:            AHCI Version 1.20 Supported /code/pre  Now I'm wondering the following:  If I would replace the Hitachi HDD with an SSD of any brand will the negotiated link speed be 3Gbps? The SSD being a SATA II or III device. Or will this be capped because it has to divide the 3Gbps over the HDD/SSD and the Superdrive?  <answer54566> There are two independent SATA channels available. Each channel will negotiate highest possible speed based on client capabilities. It will not divide 3Gbps between two clients.  And as a side answer to your question: in case you don't use Superdrive look for SATA to SATA 9.5mm optical bay caddy. This way you'll be able to put SSD in place of Superdrive and have plenty of storage on platters.  Your Macbook even accept 12.5mm thick HDDs in HDD chamber.  <answer72577> I've replaced the codeHitachi 320GB 5400rpm/code with a codeSeagate Momentus XT/code hybrid drive (4GB SSD + 500 GB HDD) and this is what it now says in my system profiler.  precodeVendor:                 NVidia Product:                MCP79 AHCI    Link Speed:             3 Gigabit    Negotiated Link Speed:  3 Gigabit    Description:            AHCI Version 1.20 Supported  /code/pre  So this confirms what iskra is saying  <comment62496> So this guy (http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showpost.php?p=580152&postcount=9) is wrong? <comment62498> Well he is as wrong as any other guy on the internet could be) You should read the whole discussion BTW -- http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=104301
