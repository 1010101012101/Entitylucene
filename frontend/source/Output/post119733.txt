Preview.app: How can I quickly find all highlights with specific colour in PDF? <body> I have a couple of PDFs (some of which are 500+ pages long). In these PDFs I made a lot of highlights, when I read through them. I came up with a colouring system, such that each colour is associated with a particular theme. Now I would like to focus on one theme/colour. I.e. quickly jump through, say the Pink highlights. However Preview.app, in its 'Highlights &amp; Notes' panel, only shows colour for notes. I am not able to see which colour I used on the highlights.   Can I somehow get an overview of the highlights and their highlight colour? Perhaps in a different program (Skim)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXKbQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer119785> I just found this link where someone used Skim and additional AppleScripts to do exactly what you are looking for, I think.  <comment139670> To add a quick note; you cannot do this in preview.app. So you don't have to spend hours searching for it. The app is very minimal in functionality. <comment139675> Not even if you wrote an AppleScript or use Automator, or something along those lines to export highlights? <comment139708> @bonna You might be able to do some AppleScript magic to export highlights somehow, but I doubt you could do it by color.
