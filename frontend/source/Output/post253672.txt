Is it possible to assign double pressing on Command button as shortcut? <body> Context of my question:     OS X El Capitan 10.11.6   MacBook Pro 13   I have some intersections between Intellij Idea and default OS X keyboard shortcuts and wonder if it possible to change Spotlight shortcut to double pressing of Command button.  Is it possible on OS X to define such a shortcut?  <comment315706> Not in the default OS. You'd need something like [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) which allows you to map shortcuts of this nature.
