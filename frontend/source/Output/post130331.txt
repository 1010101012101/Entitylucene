Is there an app other than Witch that allows windows switching (not app switching) with cmd+tab? <body> I found the Witch app (http://manytricks.com/witch/). Are there any other solutions?  <answer130428> Contexts looks nice, but I've never used it personally.  It seems to be similar in functionality with Witch, but it has a more modern (iOS 7-style) design.  It does have the ability to map itself to kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd.  It costs $9.  <comment152907> Thanks. This one's nice. App switching is completely gone though, which would still be nice to have too. <comment152987> not really what you need but in this thread:http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/123924/71490 similar programs are mentioned <comment198073> I tried Witch but the behaviour was totally unexpected. This one is works exactly how you would expect. If you used Vista Switcher on Windows, this app is a clear replacement. It's also much snappier it has a 30 days trial.
