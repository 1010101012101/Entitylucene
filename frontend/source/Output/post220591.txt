MBA & VGA monitor, using strange reduction Thunderbolt-HDMI-DVI-VGA <body> I have latest Macbook Air and I want try to use VGA monitor. I don't have MiniDisplayPort to VGA reduction, but this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cWNxC.jpg" alt="Thunderbolt-HDMI-DVI-VGA"  I know that DVI-VGA worked fine on with my old PC, so I don't understand, why doesn't work the HDMI-DVI?  strongEDIT:/strong  I tried the white adapter with HDMI cable and monitor and I doesn't work the same way. The MBA knows about monitor, but the monitor is without signal..  <answer220725> The Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter does not pass analog signal, only digital.  VGA is analog.
