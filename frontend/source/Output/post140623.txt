Accessibility (“control your computer”) rights not sticking between logins <body> I'm still using the abandonware Slate window manager (I've tried Phoenix, but it's just not the same). In order for it to manage windows properly it needs Accessibility rights. The guidelines changed in Mavericks and are no longer a global setting, and this is where I suspect the problem comes from.  Going into System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  Privacy, authenticating, and checking the box works, but only for the current login—when I log out and in again, it reverts back to unchecked and comes up with this dialog: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5woFp.png" alt="Slate&#39;s dialog box"  That dialog is generated by Slate, the original, compiled version for download. Clicking Enable does absolutely nothing.  I tried updating some of the code to work better with the Mavericks API (similar to what's in Phoenix), but I get a new dialog, this time from OS X itself:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XtNA.png" alt="OS X&#39;s dialog box"  I've tried to see if there are any file write issues using codeopensnoop/code, but that doesn't help.
