Is it possible to set up shortcuts in Xcode to jump to specific files? <body> Say I want to jump to my Storyboard file, or my Images.xcassets file. Is there a way to set up a keyboard shortcut to be able to jump to it?  <answer155542> It's not shortcut, is more like a quick way to open files. Typing kbdâ‡§/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdo/kbd lets you type the name of the file you want to open.  <comment182967> Still some more typing involved than I would like, as I have to search for the file. <comment182970> Sorry then, does not exist other way to do it.
