Converting RAW into JPEG in Photos <body> Is there a way, in Apple Photos, to convert a lot of RAW pictures into JPEGs and delete the RAW version, to save space? I'm looking for an automatic way of converting all RAW pictures into JPEG as I have several thousands.  <answer232368> Yes, you can select the RAW photos, then select "Export..." from the File menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/esM1H.png" alt="enter image description here"  There you can select JPEG as the file format, then also select any options for size and quality you desire.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TI2be.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer246729> Clean you mac 3 will do it, it finds all your raw and converts them, but be careful what you ask it to do and i believe theres a cost   <comment283928> I'm aware how to export them. I need to convert several thousands raw photos. My question is how to do it not one by one. <comment333844> As the answer showed, you can export many photos at once.
