Shortcut for making a new window in Safari <body> Whenever I use the new window shortcut in Safari, it creates a new tab instead of a new window. This most likely happens due to my having chosen the setting codeSystem Preferences &gt; Dock &gt; Prefer tabs when opening documents: &gt; Always/code checked.  However, strangely enough, clicking on the menu bar item codeFile &gt; New Window/code seems to create a new window normally – not a new tab.  Is it possible to create a new tab with the shortcut?  <answer271453> In macOS Sierra 10.12.3, by default the keyboard shortcut to open a new window in most apps is strong⌘N/strong, however when one changes the default setting in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongDock/strong  strongPrefer tabs when opening documents:/strong from strongIn Full Screen Only/strong to strongAlways/strong the strongNew Window/strong keyboard shortcut is changed to strong⌥⌘N/strong.  <comment341182> What version of Safari and OS X/macOS are you using? <comment341184> Whoops, macOS Sierra 10.12.3 running Safari 10.0.3 <comment341185> Presumably Sierra, considering that pref <comment341199> In macOS Sierra 10.12.3, by default the keyboard shortcut to open a new window in most apps is **⌘N**, however when one changes the default setting in **System Preferences**  **Dock**  **Prefer tabs when opening documents:** from **In Full Screen Only** to **Always**, the **New Window** keyboard shortcut is changed to **⌥⌘N**. Under those circumstances, are you saying that in Safari when you press the System assigned keyboard shortcut for **New Window** it opens a new Tab instead on a new Window? <comment341209> Wow! So I changed the **Prefer tabs when opening documents:** setting to **Always**. Then I realized in Safari the shortcut was **⌥⌘N**. I was confused, but decided to change the shortcut to **⌘N** in **System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts**. That's what led me to the problem above. Looks like I can't make the shortcut **⌘N** and retain the **New Window** functionality. If you write your comment as an answer to the question, I'll accept it.
