Can I open files in TextEdit from the Terminal in Mac OS X? <body> I frequently find that a Terminal command to open a file in TextEdit would be very handy. Does such a command exist on Mac OS X?  <answer25845> This is not a programming question. But I did a quick google and found this site:  http://ss64.com/osx/   http://ss64.com/osx/pico.html pico: Simple text editor  http://ss64.com/vi.html vi: Text Editor  And this site explains how to use TextEdit from terminal.  http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2754/os_x_edit_file_using_textedit_as_root_superuser/  <answer25846> For those finding this post:  The solution was to use the command code sudo open -t /path/file.txt /code  And the man pages for the open command also show how to do some other things like show the file in the finder.  http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/open.1.html  <answer25851> codeopen -a TextEdit filename/code should do the trick.   The code-a/code flag specifies any application you want, so it's applicable to any number of situations, including ones where TextEdit isn't the default editor.  h3Other relevant options/h3  ul licode-t/code opens in the default editor (i.e. if you use BBEdit, TextMate, etc.)/li licode-e/code will open the file specifically in TextEdit/li /ul  <answer25855> The open command can be used to open files (in their default apps, unless using the -a flag), URLs (in your default web browser), and directories (in Finder).  An example would be  precodeopen /Users/Example/Desktop/example.rtf /code/pre  <answer102063> Direct, easy answer - add an alias to your ~/.bash_profile like:   precodealias textedit='open -a TextEdit' /code/pre  Invoke it like:   precodetextedit theFiletoEdit.txt /code/pre  The difference between this and the other answer, is you can easily remember it when you want it. Typing codetext/code and kbdTab/kbd to autocomplete it will make it instantly available   hr  For those with a bit more bash background, who want the reasoning without having to fuss with figuring it out:    ul liThe problem is that a trivial symlink (or its ilk, like a shell script redirect) to  code/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit/code causes a new instance of codeTextEdit/code to open the file you pass to it. This works, but does not give your expected Mac OS X default behavior.  (if you try it, you'll see) /li liTo get the default UI behavior, using the Mac built-in codeopen/code command, with that '-a TextEdit' flag (that others mentioned) induces the Mac UI to have (any) currently running instance of TextEdit handle the call (with no inapropos 'sudo' needed for general case usage)./li /ul  <comment29363> None of those links demonstrate how to open the file in textEdit. <comment29364> The last link does. <comment29365> It absolutely does, thanks for adding that, you are a much faster googler than I. <comment29366> Does that work? Cause I have no experience with Mac OSX (Windows fan boy ^^) <comment29367> yup, does exactly what I wanted, thanks! <comment29381> Probably the best solution. <comment29652> Using `sudo` is unnecessary and undesirable. <comment48096> Unless the file isn't accessible to the user otherwise.  But in general, agreed. <comment94652> I'm trying to open Sublime Text from command line. I did "open -a /Applications/Sublime Text 2.app my_file.txt". It works but it creates a new window every time I want to open a file. Any fix? <comment105975> Actually, I just tried using this command with sudo to edit `/etc/hosts` on Lion and it just doesn't work (as expected). It doesn't allow me to **edit** the file. Only clone it. Might as well go without the `sudo`, in this case. The file will be marked as *locked* anyway. To really be able to do so, have to first open the TextEdit in root mode, or just use a different editor: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20199/how-do-i-open-a-file-as-root-in-textedit-on-lion <comment105976> If you want it with `sudo`, [gota open TextEdit in root mode first](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20199/how-do-i-open-a-file-as-root-in-textedit-on-lion) <comment182819> This is probably the easiest way to open text files for edit in a graphical editor from the terminal. <comment225333> If you want a program whose name has spaces, you'll need to escape them, e.g., open -a Adobe\ Photoshop\ CS6 image.png <comment270939> How to open it with SublimeText3 that stays in /path/SublimeText3? <comment285007> In `open` command's manual, you will see `-e  Causes the file to be opened with /Applications/TextEdit`. So `open -e filename` do the same thing, and is simpler. <comment327676> @MohammadMoghimi Try simply using the `sublime` command.
