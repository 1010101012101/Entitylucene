MTS / AVCHD importation for Photos.app? <body> I have a Sony HD video camera that I switch to USB mode and then can drill down into the codeAVCHD/code file structure to find the MTS files.  I can then import these to Photos.app, but I'd like to know if there's a better or more direct way.  Any ideas or workflows that allow direct importation whilst perhaps converting to a "better" format (e.g. at least wrapping it)?  codeFree AVCHD to Mov.app/code from the App Store just doesn't cut it a lot of the time, throwing some odd errors and not seeming to have very good support.
