To Install Latin Modern Math font in OS X <body> I want to have the codes of the project GUST in my OS X.  Franck indicates here that the definite way is to download those fonts from there and install.  However, I would like to find some packaged version because this is so standard tool.  The fonts were removed from MacTeX 2015, while they were in MacTeX 2013.  I could not find the fonts in homebrew.   h2Test code/h2  precode\documentclass{article} \usepackage{fontspec} \usepackage{polyglossia} % also loads package fontspec \usepackage{unicode-math} % if you also need maths \setmathfont{Latin Modern Math} \begin{document} $\not\to$ \end{document} /code/pre  giving emfont-not-found/em error.  Disabling the line code\setmathfont{Latin Modern Math}/code gives the bad arrow which I do not want to have:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ynife.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Installing fonts manually/h2  I downloaded the fonts here from the GUST project.  I added the fonts to my system by opening emfontbook/em and adding there the fonts directly.  However, there is no emLatin Modern Math/em in the package:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UV72O.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zS5D.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can you install Modern Latin Math font in OS X?  <answer225824> I've also noticed The Latin Modern fonts are not installed to OS X with the MacTeX2015 distibution.   The LM fonts (also the math font) are installed in the tex distribution under:  code/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm/code and code/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm-math/code  To use these font's throughout OS X there is no need to reinstall them, you can link these fonts to your codeFonts/code in OS X as follows:  precodeln -s /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm/ '/Library/Fonts/Latin Modern' ln -s /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm-math/ '/Library/Fonts/Latin Modern Math' /code/pre  emNote: This was inspired by the comments on this question./em  <comment248038> The mactex-additions.pkg in the second link is now a broken link, not just from there but to original source too, although the [2012 package](ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/mactex/2012/mactex-additions.pkg) still exists however not worth the 268.2 MB download when the fonts linked from the first link are 3.9 MB (OTF only).  I had no problem downloading and installing the fonts from [The Latin Modern collection v. 2.004â€”OTF files](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern/download/lm2.004otf.zip) using the OS X native Font Book to do it in one felled swoop. <comment248039> Continued from first comment... I unzipped the archive and used Add Fonts... to select all 72 files and that was that. <comment248079> I added the ways to illustrate that the package does not contain *Latin Modern Math* font. Most others however. Can you replicate? <comment248092> Can't you get it at  http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/lm-math/download/index_html <comment248098> @TomGewecke I did it but it did not solve the misaligned line of the arrow. I do not understand what causes it, since the font should solve the problem. <comment248121> What is the Unicode number of that arrow character? <comment274119> Just realised it might be even better to link them to your user fonts in `~/Library/Fonts` <comment274120> Thank you for your answer! It is logical and better than new installation. <comment291653> Or, import the font from the texlive location into Font Book: Click on the '+' symbol (or menu File  Add Fonts... or shortcut &#8984;-O) and then click SHIFT-CMD-G (Go to Folder) in the file selection dialog to get a text field where you can enter `/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/` and then select both, `lm` and `lm-math` folders.
