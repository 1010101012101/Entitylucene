Will FaceTime reveal my caller ID on an incoming call? <body> Obviously if I initiate a FaceTime call then the recipient will see the caller ID that I've selected in my FaceTime settings.  However, if someone calls me at one of my emalternative/em addresses, is my chosen caller ID revealed to them in any way? Or will they still only know about the address/number they used?  <answer70711> For all the experience I have, calling my family in multiple IDs, the person only knows the ID that they already have, and FaceTime has no options to automatically reveal the other IDs that person uses.  I wanted to enable some automatic thing like this for myself, because I have 4 different cell numbers and 3 e-mails with FaceTime. Still have not found how to do it.  So for you, the answer is "no, they still only know about the ID they used".
