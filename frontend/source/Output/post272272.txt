How brew declare new applications or modules to be found by a new installation <body> I was trying to install php downloaded from http://php.net/distributions/php-7.1.0.tar.gz  I used this procedure: code./configure ... --with-gd/code. But with the code--with-gd/code option the installation doesn't finish properly.  Then tested Over new recently installed macOS Sierra Virtual Machine (if before procedure of install php), and the before procedure worked perfectly!  Some happens with my Library links, or path or includes on my MacBook...  Then, over my real machine (MacBook Air), I installed php using homebrew (brew install php71) internally uses code--with-gd/code option, I noted that worked perfectly. I did not need to install previously gd libraries externally or separately (Homebrew also did not install the gd library).  First Question:strongHow does homebrew discover the path of the gd library?/strong  I want to know how homebrew declares the path to be found by another applications or another new installation like ./configure...  Example:  I was installing gd with codebrew install gd/code.  Then I found that installation was in code/usr/local/Cellar/gd/code  Then when I tried to install another application without homebrew, else binary Source code.tar.gz/code (ie: php), my ./configure, it detects the new location of module/application made by brew...  Then I want to know how does homebrew to do enable /usr/local/Cellar/gd like new location for gd.  Second Question: strongHow does homebrew achieve this?/strong  <comment342240> It's really difficult to edit your question: e.g. what do you wanna tell us writing: "...(if before procedure of install php)..." <comment342262> @klanomath thank you for clarify my question. I'm testing multiple installations using Source Code (.tar.gz), I used php for this question Only... I want only understand how to improve them.
