Why is my iPhone not enabled for iTunes <body> Attempting to purchase iTunes for iPhone 6 from Apple Store. Download response indicates iPhone not enabled for iTunes. What does this mean?  <answer224106> Pre-existing Apple ID need to accept the store conditions before downloading. Only if you are creating a new Apple ID can you roll account creation/validation/download into one transaction.  Post an image of your specific error message if this general guidance isn't helpful.
