Change startup bong on macbook pro <body> Is there any way I can change the startup bong on my Early 2011 MBP 8,2 to something custom?  Like, The Final Countdown?  <answer224261> h1You technically can't.../h1  But there are a few things you can do instead.  Using a few techniques I picked up on the interwebs, I've figured out a way to both  ol liDisable the boot chime (seriously, I don't recommend this.

If someone else can get it to work, lemme know, I'll add it)/li /ol  h3Disabling the boot chime/h3  supI seriously recommend not doing this.

Hooray!  <comment271948> It wouldn't really make sense to be able to - the startup chime is held in firmware, I believe, so you'd have to flash a custom chime in, which only the great and mighty Apple can do. I'll look around more, though. <comment271954> I mean, this is on a MBP with the documented GPU issue (screen distorts and all) so I'm basically installing various OSs and seeing what's stable, then I'm just going to have fun with it.  I mean, a startup sound of Thunderstruck would be awesome.  Or Dixie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLjMRHiY0UU <comment271963> As far as I know, _there is no way to modify the startup chime_. However, you can totally silence the original startup chime (not recommended, but you don't seem bothered by that) and simply use a cron job on startup as root to run a sound file through Afplay. <comment271968> Good point.  Not exact timing, but it's interesting enough.  Make it an answer and I'll accept. <comment271969> BTW, OS X is long gone on this thing.  I put Windows 10 on it (yes, I did - don't panic, it's not here to stay) to see if it was stablish, and it seems to go unstable once it switches to the dedicated GPU. <comment271971> Why not use a virtual machine? I have (had) Win10 on a virtual machine, works perfectly. <comment271974> Hmm. I can't seem to make the `Afplay` script run at boot (tried root `crontab` and a LaunchDaemon). I can drop an answer relating to a _login_ chime, but I know that's not what you asked... would that still suffice? <comment271977> I was looking for a firmware change, so it would work without OSX, so at this point it's really up to you.  If you want to waste 30 seconds writing an answer go for it and get +25 for an accepted answer.
