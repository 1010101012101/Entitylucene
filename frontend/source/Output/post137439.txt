Mac 10.5.8 system does not detect snow leopard cd disc to upgrade <body> I have a mac running on 10.5.8 and I want top upgrade it to snow leopard. When I insert the disc it does not show up. I tried booting it by pressing the option key, the C key and the command S key but the system starts normally every time. Is there something wrong with the system or the disc? I had the same problem for another mac running on the same system.  <comment163320> Are you using a Bluetooth keyboard? Some people have trouble with boot keys on wireless keyboardsâ€”try a USB keyboard? <comment163322> @GeorgeGarside I am using a usb keyboard itself and it still doesnt work..! <comment163323> Is the Mac new enough to run 10.6? <comment163325> Yes. I did check the system requirements before trying to update. <comment163332> Sounds like either a bad disc or a bad super drive.  Perform some tests to single out one or the other, try the SL disc in another computer, try some other discs in this computer. <comment163342> Maybe you need to disable the Autoplay in syst pref
