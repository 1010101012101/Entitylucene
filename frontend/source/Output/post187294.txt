Group search results by album in Flickr <body> My photos file names have the date in them e.g. 2015-05-15-123.jpg so when I do a Search in the iOS app for say 2015 I get all photos taken in 2015 but they are shown in a flat list. Is there a way to group them by Album instead?  <answer187305> I have checked with version 4.0.1 of the iOS flickr app. I am sorry to say, but it is strongnot possible/strong to group yearly search results by album with this version. Here is a screenshot of my search results:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/10DVG.jpg" alt="ios flickr app screenshot"  By the way, the file names of the uploaded are irrelevant for flickr, as they take the date info from metadata within the photo, via EXIF data.  <comment221307> Is this question specifically about using the iOS app? <comment221308> Yes, it is about using the iOS app <comment221330> Thanks. That's a bummer. My folders are organized using Year/Event/bunch of files in folder(s). The Windows Uploadr auto creates a album for each leaf node/folder. Basically, I was hoping to get the best of both worlds i.e  navigate Flickr like a traditional folder hierarchy or using the metadata. Looks like my only option is to browse the timeline view, identify the date I need and then pick any photo, click the Info icon, see what Album it is filed under and go to that Album. Kinda cumbersome.
