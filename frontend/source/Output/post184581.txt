No AirDrop option on iPhone 4s <body> I have an iPhone 4s running iOS 8.3. I am trying to send a file from a Mac to the iPhone through AirDrop. Mac notifies that      if I want to share a file with someone using iOS, he/she must open Control Center and enable AirDrop.   However, I tried to follow these steps, but there is no AirDrop option on my iPhone.  <answer184583> iPhone 4s doesn't support AirDrop. You need an iPhone 5 or newer.  <answer216065> iPhone 4s iOS 8.3  Jailbreak Install Cydia Install Repo Search &amp; Instal Airdrop Thank me later!   <comment218850> ah - that'll do it every time - well spotted @grgarside :)
