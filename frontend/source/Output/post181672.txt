Problem with TC's 5GHz channel <body> I have MBP Retina late 2013 with OS X 10.10.3 on board, so the last few days I have troubles with connection via 5GHz channel - no internet connection at all after some time I use it, the 2,4GHz is all ok. I'm trying to change some settings in Time Capsule, but it didn't help. So, what's the problem here?  <comment216091> 5GHz while fast it is also very sensitive to disturbances. Check your RSSI values in the WiFi signal from time to time, it should be better than 60 (lower than) <comment216194> I have 59  - 63  on the average.
