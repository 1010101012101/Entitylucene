Dollar sign in mdfind shell command <body> I'm a newbie in shell scripting. What's the difference between these two commands? What's the use of the dollar sign?  precodemdfind $'kMDItemFSName="*iValet\'s*"c' /code/pre    precodemdfind 'kMDItemFSName="*iValet\'s*"c' /code/pre  <answer135331> A dollar sign before a single-quoted string is just another type of string, but it allows C-like escape characters, like code\n/code and code\'/code.   It was used in the command you mentioned because it contains an escape for the single quote—normal single quoted strings do not allow emany/em escapes at all, including escapes of the code'/code. Backslashes are interpreted literally. So by using code$'…'/code it avoided escaping the double quotes, and allowed the string to have a code'/code in it.   There is some more information on this type of string quoting here on the Bash Hackers Wiki.  <comment160404> I've never heard of C-strings in bash. Neat. <comment160427> @0942v8653 thank you, now it's all clear.
