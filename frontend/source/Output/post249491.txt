How do I resolve 501: Method Not Implemented in MRD for OSX El Captain? <body> I've gotten a MBP with El Captain installed &amp; latest MRD (Microsoft Remote Desktop) 8.0.33 - However when I try connecting to a Windows host with it's PC name given along with credentials .. MRD gives me the following:     HTTPEndpointException: 4, The non-proxy http connection failed to   connect with the message: 501 Not Implemented stack exchange   The same credentials &amp; settings worked before, it somehow doesn't work now. I have done intensive research on it including this, this, this, this &amp; this to no avail at all. I've also attempted to install emRoyal TSX/em, and it gives me the below:     The connection failed. (Error Code: CONNECTERROR)   I'm fed up &amp; would require to handle office docs &amp; mailboxes from my Windows Host. I can't ssh into for obvious office reasons. Can the community resolve this one?  <answer249784> After a lot of trial &amp; error, I figured out the most logical assumptions &amp; got it to work. It goes like this (in-case anyone else finds the same problem &amp; is looking forward to an answer):  ol liDetermine the host gate way/li liPhysically access the computer/li liOpen up Windows Services (if host is Windows)/li liIn Services, look for Remote Desktop Services/li liIn Remote Desktop Services, click codeProperties/code &amp; drop down to codeAutomatic/code if not already/li liRestart the Machine (Optional)/li /ol  Try again with your MBP, and with Wireless connection, you need not set any additional GW info on RDP Client. Food for thought is - this could be one possible way out of many other circumstances you run into. Make sure RDP services aren't disabled on the GW which's suppose to distribute the connection packets &amp; route it the way it should.   Let me know in case I could additionally help with something entirely different if the circumstances are different &amp; RDP services are already not disabled.  <comment309576> tbh, trying to follow Windows around a truly dynamic DHCP setup using host name I gave up long ago as a hopeless task, even with a forced always-on Master Browser. In the end I just fixed all the relevant IP addresses in my DHCP server to static mappings & use those instead. <comment309651> @Tetsujin the GW needs to be assigned. Once if you are in a wireless network, the same config worked just as fine for me & now it just doesn't. I have a static IP with IP's assigned by DHCP to 2 different Win hosts. <comment309735> I think this might be up for a bounty since it's of a hack to be accomplished. Tried several times today without results.
