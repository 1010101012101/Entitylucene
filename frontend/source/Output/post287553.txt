Pictures are gone! <body> I kept getting an error when I tried to email pictures so I looked online for help. It said to sign out of iCloud then sign back in, I did that now all of my pictures are gone!!! Is there any way to get them back? Thank you for any help you might offer.  <comment363085> If you log in on icloud.com, are the pictures still there? <comment363207> What was the initial error that you got that lead you to where you are now? What resource did you view that suggested you sign out of iCloud?
