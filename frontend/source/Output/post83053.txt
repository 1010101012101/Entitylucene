macos x terminal cursor is 1 posisiton righter then it should be <body> When I start terminal the cursor position is 1 position righter then it should be and there is a gap between last symbol and the cursor.  How can I fix it?  <answer83067> "1 position righter then it should be" is a matter of opinion :-) I believe the cursor is right where it should be. But either way, this is determined by the codePS1/code environment variable (assuming you're using the default bash shell)  You'll want to set codePS1/code to not have a training space on the end of it. The exact command will depend on what your codePS1/code is currently. The following should get you there:  precodeecho $PS1 /code/pre  Will show you what codePS1/code currently is. Copy that value, then execute:  precodeexport PS1="&lt;paste value&gt;" /code/pre  Pasting the value you copied in place of code&lt;paste value&gt;/code. Be sure to not have a training space. So in my case, I did:  precodeexport PS1="\h:\W \u\$" /code/pre  To make this stick, add the codeexport PS1/code line to your code.bashrc/code file with a text editor.  <comment95738> A screenshot could be helpful.
