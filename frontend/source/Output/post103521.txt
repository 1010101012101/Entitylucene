How do I turn the ringer on for incoming calls? <body> How do I turn the ringer on for incoming calls for the Sprint iPhone version 7.0 model MD146LL/A? I've already tried going under settings to sounds.  <answer103522> One possible way I think, Is the Mute button on the left turned down, turn it up Other thing can you play music from the speakers? If no then there is a problem with the Speaker.
