Apple terminal no home and end key - Use cmd left or cmd right <body> How do I make  kbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbd⌘/kbd+kbd→/kbd move the text cursor very left and right of the terminal entry line. This keyboard shortcut works on most things on my mac book but not the Terminal.  Usually I use the home and end keys on other non apple computers. Strangely enough kbd⌃/kbd+kbdA/kbd and kbd⌃/kbd+kbdE/kbd achieve this in the mac terminal but it is the wrong key combination in my opinion. I want to do it using kbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbd⌘/kbd+kbd→/kbd.  It is similar to this question, however I want to specifically map it to kbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbd⌘/kbd+kbd→/kbd.  Can home and end keys be mapped when using Terminal?  <answer170769> You can use Better Touch Tool for this (it's free), just assign keyboard shortcuts  to work in strongTerminal/strong app only. Remap kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd←/kbd to kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdA/kbd and kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd→/kbd to kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdE/kbd. Here's the sample:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fO7cC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer170770> You can adjust the keybindings in Terminals preferences under Profiles - Keyboard. This is on a Profile by profile basis. Map kbdcontrol/kbd+kbda/kbd (code\001/code) to the goto beginning of line and kbdcontrol/kbd+kbde/kbd (code\005/code) to go to the end of the line to any keyboard shortcut you want (just don't overwrite anything important already in use) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2674c.png" alt="Terminal Preference"  <comment200864> this method doesnt work with the cmd key <comment200897> Ahhh... I see. It seems that Command modifiers are used by the App itself (including, sort of, cmd+arrows). <comment316578> At the risk of sounding like a purist: ⌃+E and ⌃+A are the right ones, and ⌘+← and ⌘+→ are wrong. The E and A also work everywhere else in standard Mac text editing places, and on every Linux, Unix and BSD.
