Is there a way to color parts of the man pages on the terminal? <body> I would like to color some parts of the output of the command codeman/code, specifically I would like to be able to change the color of the most important things, for example the options or the first introduction to each command.  Is it possible?  I know I can change the color of the prompt and of the output of the command codegrep/code and codels/code, so I thought we could actually customise more things (if yes, in general, could you please show me a complete guide?).  <answer182344> Assuming you're fairly default and using bash:  ul lihttp://www.tuxarena.com/2012/04/tutorial-colored-man-pages-how-it-works//li /ul  Short version:br Add the following to your .bashrc file:  precodeexport LESS_TERMCAP_mb=$(printf '\e[01;31m') # enter blinking mode – red export LESS_TERMCAP_md=$(printf '\e[01;35m') # enter double-bright mode – bold, magenta export LESS_TERMCAP_me=$(printf '\e[0m') # turn off all appearance modes (mb, md, so, us) export LESS_TERMCAP_se=$(printf '\e[0m') # leave standout mode export LESS_TERMCAP_so=$(printf '\e[01;33m') # enter standout mode – yellow export LESS_TERMCAP_ue=$(printf '\e[0m') # leave underline mode export LESS_TERMCAP_us=$(printf '\e[04;36m') # enter underline mode – cyan /code/pre  If you use ZSH as part of oh-my-zsh there's a plugin for man-page coloring: colored-man  <comment217053> @Rinzler Please use helpful edit summaries when making suggested edits to help reviewers understand *why* you've made the changes that you have.
