App Store can't verify purchased applications <body> This morning, when launching an application I purchased from the App store some time ago, I was greeted with a sign-in box telling me that Apple needed to verify the application.  I signed in using my iTunes password (which I've since double checked, and I know I entered accurately), and was greeted with the following message in reply:  codeYour device or computer could not be verified. Contact support for assistance./code  Some poking about online shows one thread from a couple years ago where someone says he called Apple and they told him to delete "the plist", but that's all the information given.  Deleting code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppStore.plist/code did nothing to change the issue, however.  A couple of these applications are required for work.  Any ideas on what the issue is or how to fix it?  <answer229714> Short of calling Apple Support (or web chat or twitter @AppleSupport) you could check a few things:  ul lidate and time are correct and set automatically/li lisign out and in to the App store with your Apple ID/li lidelete the app in Launchpad and download it again (make a backup in case the app has been pulled from the store)/li limake a new user account - delete the app and re-install it from the new user/li lirestart the OS/li /ul  <comment279403> ...& did you try contacting Apple support for assistance?
