Garageband - Remove Dead Space at End of Track <body> I was sidetracked while recording something off of the internet into Garageband. How do I cut off all of the dead space at the end of my recording?   <answer247577> By saying emcut off all of the dead space/em, I assume you wanna crop the track to remove silence at the end of the track? If I'm right, here is 1 solution:  ol liAdd the track to your iTunes/li liRight click on track and Get Info (or just kbdcmd/kbd+kbdi/kbd)/li liSelect Options tab/li liTick stop, and select time you want track to end and press ok/li liGo to iTunes Preferences: kbdcmd/kbd+kbd,/kbd (comma)/li liIn General tab, click on Import Settings and select your output format, eg. MP3, then ok/li liClick on your song, go File  Convert  Create MP3/AAC version/li liWhen this is complete you can find this track by right clicking on it and say Show in Finder/li /ol  Hope this is what you wanted? If not, it might help someone else as this option has been silently removed from the right-click context menu. :) Let us know.  <comment305491> Did you try selecting the recorded content, copying it, and then pasting into a new track? <comment369671> You can't just click at the end of the track and drag backwards until you get to actual recording? Are you asking about deleting that space in GarageBand or iTunes?
