How could I solve reminders not closing on a Mac, Sierra OSX? <body> From about 1 week before seeing a video that "freezes iOS" on Web.WhatsApp My Mac started to behave strangely, slowly and the most annoying:  When past and new remainders show up in the screen and I press Complete, Ignore, etc. They just show up 30 seconds later.  This isn't happening always and with every remainder. Is this problem will be solved with a clean install on Sierra?
