locationd on iOS iPhone crashing every 3 secs (Location jumps) <body> I am having a weird issue that my location on the map keeps jumping around. Navigation and tracking my location became impossible since most apps are very confused when this happens.  Model: iPhone 7 Plus 32 GB  What I've tried so far ...  ul liTurning iPhone off/on (also leave it off for several minutes)/li liTurning off/on location services (also leave it off for several minutes)/li liTurning off/on flight mode (also leave it off for several minutes)/li liTurning off/on wifi (also leave it off for several minutes)/li liResetting location service/li liUpdating to latest iOS 10.3 Beta (was running 10.2.1)/li liMake a full reset of my iPhone and set it up as a new iPhone/li liRestoring it from backup/li liDowngrade to 10.2.1 and clean iPhone install/li /ul  So I guess pretty much everything one could try ...  There is a video showing the problem:  http://imgur.com/DWTyIsU  Also here some of the crash reports if you are interested.  http://pastebin.com/Na3Hq3ap  http://pastebin.com/c340Eat0  Contacted apple now, will send my iPhone for repair.
