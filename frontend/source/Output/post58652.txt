How to enable read receipts for messages in iMessage on Mountain Lion? <body> I can't find any way to enable read receipts for messages on Mountain Lion.  Read receipts are the iOS term for acknowledgements that show wether or not a message has been read yet or not.  Does Messages for Mountain Lion support read receipts at all?  <answer58657> From the Messages app section of the Apple Mountain Lion "what's new" page:     Turn on read receipts, and they’ll see when you’ve read a message.   According to this OS X Daily post, you can send read receipts in the Message app by following these steps:     ol   liOpen Preferences in iMessage, and select the “Accounts” tab /li   liSelect   the Message account from the left /li   liCheck the box next to “Send Read       Receipts” to enable/li   liClose out of iMessage Preferences/li   /ol   Screenshot from this post: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5revc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I can confirm the presence of the checkbox on my own Mac.  <comment67617> Thanks! What an awkward place =/ too bad googling this gave me 10 pages of Mountain Lion reviews talking about the same generic set of new apps lol -.-'
