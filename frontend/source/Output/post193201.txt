Can't see hidden files with Standard user <body> I am using my Mac as a Standard user. Running latest OSX 10.10.3  I have used the following command from terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowALLFiles YES /code/pre  But I still can't see my hidden files.  I've checked my ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist file and the correct entry is already there:  precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;AppleShowALLFiles&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;YES&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  If I login as Administrator, this command works fine. If I login as a different Standard user, this command works fine. It is something about this specific Standard user account that is preventing the command from working, but there is no way I am creating a new account just to fix this small issue. Anyone have any idea why this isn't working as it should?  <answer193204> Use kbdcmd/kbd+kbdr/kbd then open Terminal and type: coderesetpassword/code  On the next window, click on the name of your volume (usually “Macintosh HD”), then select the troubled user account name from the drop-down.  Skip the actual password fields (you are not changing the password).  Click the button on the bottom section labeled strong“Reset Home Folder Permissions and ACLs.”/strong  Restart  <comment230136> while in the problematic user account try to repair disk permissions or even that users ACL's. <comment230140> Ah, ok I googled `osx repair user permissions` and `osx repair user ACL` and found this link:  http://osxdaily.com/2011/11/15/repair-user-permissions-in-mac-os-x-lion/  Apparently, a Disk Utility `Repair Disk Permissions` **does not** repair user directory permissions, or the ACL.  You have to follow a separate (and nonsensical) path to get to the utility that allows user permission repair.  I will try this and report back. <comment230142> correct findings, and sorry for not been clearer, I newer know what the OP skills are. <comment230159> It looks like this only works from Terminal if you boot into Recovery mode.  It does not work from the Terminal in OSX <comment230254> I have not been able to reboot my computer yet. <comment230256> A new problem ? Could you describe it? <comment230258> No, I mean I have been too busy to shut down all my work and reboot my computer.  I will reply here as soon as I try the user permissions/ACL repair. <comment230423> OK, I tried **Reset Home Folder Permissions and ACLs**.  For other people trying this, note that, you must boot into recovery mode *first*.  Also, if you are using File Vault (or if your disk is otherwise encrypted), after booting to recovery mode, you must *first* open Disk Utility and *unlock* the disk.  Only then can you quit Disk Utility and open Terminal (Utilities - Terminal) and continue with the instructions. <comment230424> Anyway, this didn't work.  I still can't view hidden files.  There is some other strangeness with my Standard user that I am just noticing now (I don't reboot my machine a lot).  *Every time* I reboot, my Mac *will not* let me into my Standard user.  it rejects my password (even though I am sure it is correct).  I must *first* login as the Administrator user (which takes longer than normal, displaying a progress bar for about 5 - 10 seconds), then log out, and only then can I login to my Standard user (the same password it rejected earlier works fine).  I can replicate this with every boot.
