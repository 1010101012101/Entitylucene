OS X Mavericks scrollbars appear even without external mouse <body> For about 2 weeks now are the scroll bars appearing permanently at my mac. I know that they appear when you have an external mouse connected. It was normal that they appeared only when I scrolled, but now they don't disappear anymore.    MacBook Air Late 2010, OS X Mavericks 10.9.2  <answer128070> For what ever reason you have this enabled in your general preferences  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rEI0S.png" alt="pref"
