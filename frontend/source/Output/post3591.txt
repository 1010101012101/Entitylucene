How to recover a deleted file on Mac OS X? <body> We have tried Boomerang but it does not find the deleted file. The file was deleted 3 days ago. I would think it is recoverable, but Boomerang does not show it.  Any help would be appreciated.  <answer3595> PhotoRec is the best tool I've found for recovering files.  It does have some baffling limitations however, like the fact that it can't recover .dmg files.  It's a command line program but still very easy to use.  And it's free :)  This step-by-step guide on their wiki makes it even easier.  <answer207188> I use Data Rescue software for when there isn't a backup. It's not scammy, it does the job (very well IMO), and doesn't damage drives like some other tools will do.   <comment3312> Recoverability depends entirely on where the file was located on the hard drive and where data has been written since the file was deleted. Three days is a long time. <comment3322> What file type is it? <comment3361> The file is a Adobe InDesign file: .indd. <comment3367> PhotoRec supports .indd.  I suggest you try out my suggestion ASAP or the file will likely become unrecoverable. <comment33228> Not to lecture and I do feel your pain but this type of thing is exactly what Time Machine was built for. One situation like this is sometimes enough to get folks using it. Once you're through recovering the file with the help of the excellent advice here consider giving TM a try on an external drive. <comment92502> “The file was deleted 3 days ago.” I would say it’s gone if this was on an active drive of any kind. And has the system been in use for 3 days? Basically, once a file is erased & then the system grinds back to work the risk of the data being overwritten is high. If you said 3 seconds I would have advise to power off the machine immediately, boot in target disk mode from another machine & then attempt to use undeletion tools.  But as @Richard states, backups are key. I don’t like using Time Machine, but have backups. The cost of drives is less than the cost of time & money lost on lost data.
