iPod Classic won't recognize its files anymore <body> This is an odd one. The last few times I've plugged in my 7th Gen iPod classic (PC running Windows 8.1), there was a pop-up saying "There's a problem with this drive. Scan the drive now and fix it." I always eject the thing properly from iTunes before disconnecting. I've been using the same PC and same iTunes program for years. Nothing's changed, so I don't know why this message started appearing, but I clicked on 'scan' just to shut it up. I've done this before with a couple flash drives without much of anything happening.  What's weird is that my iPod is still full of everything it had before, but it's not recognized as music. iTunes now displays the contents as 144GB of "other" files that it won't read. Clicking the "on this iPod" button just brings up a blank sheet. I've reset the iPod itself a couple times, and it's still in the same state. It says there's only 3.8GB of free space, so it's still mostly full, but the menu says "no music," "no artists," "no albums" etc. When it's plugged into the PC, Windows Explorer still shows iPod_control/Music with all the folders and files in place where they've always been. The Apple software just won't see it anymore.  Is there a handy way to switch the settings back to whatever they were before? I know I could copy everything to a blank folder on my hard disk, then wipe the iPod and re-import it. I'd just rather avoid that time-consuming nuisance if I can help it.
