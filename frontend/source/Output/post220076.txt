What does the 's' character mean in iPhone 5s and 6s series <body> I found a similar question for iPhone 3Gs and iPhone 4s here. So what about the 's' character meaning in 5s and 6s series of iPhone?  <answer220087> The iPhone 5s "strongs/strong" apparently stands for strongs/strongecurity (they added touch ID), but the "strongs/strong" in iPhone 6s is still largely debated, though some have speculated that it might be for strongs/strongensitivity (as per the new 3D Touch features)  However, apple has never really released any official information regarding what the s stands for in any model other than the 3GS, where it stood for strongs/strongpeed, so really, every s since then could have multiple meanings, or all stand for speed.  But really, I don't think apple plans what the s stands for, it is just a symbol to show that this model has improvements upon its predecessor, but is not altogether different.   <answer220095> s stands for "We don't really have enough features to release a new iPhone, but we're gonna do it anyway."  <answer220138> It's debatable.   Some say the "s" always stands for "successor". Like how the 6s makes great improvements on the 6, but since it doesn't have a new design, Apple shouldn't really call it the iPhone 7.  However, Phil Schiller, at the iPhone 3GS release event, said specifically that the S in 3GS stood for "speed", based on how much faster it was than the 3G.  Fans also sometimes make up their own meanings for what the s stands for:  iPhone 4s: Siri  iPhone 5s: Security (for TouchID)  However, at this point, Apple's naming scheme is set after almost a decade and they'll just give every other iPhone name an s, so it likely does just mean strongsuccessor/strong.  <answer231831> the "S" stands for 'Same' IPhone 5Same  <comment266320> I take it as something like `second thought`, or maybe `superior`. <comment266335> The 4s did have an official *s* in the form of [an interview question answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/27009). <comment266400> I agree with other answers, but I'd like to note something. Whenever Apple appends an S to an iPhone, they change the interior rather than the looks of it. It is true for all generations, for instance the 3G & 3GS look the same, and so do the 4 & 4S, and so on. <comment266406> IMO s models are much better: Video Recording, Siri, 64-bit processing, TouchID, 3D Touch were all introduced on s models. Non-s models are great and add new features too, but s models really improve on the older model. <comment266495> @grgarside Does that really count though? To me at least, the way Tim Cook phrased his answer makes it seem as if he doesn't really mind, and that it is just open to interpretation. <comment283175> Really? I don't think that the iPhone 5 had TouchID, a 64-bit A7 SoC, came in gold, recorded in slo-mo, or had burst mode. <comment348785> I like this joke~
