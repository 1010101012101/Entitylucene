NTFS Drivers on Mac <body> I recently purchased a MacBook Air. I have an external 3TB Hard Drive that I would like to use, however, I have used this drive to backup files from my desktop (Windows) computer and the drive is setup with NTFS format, thus I can read files from the hard drive but I cannot write files to the hard drive.  I read that I could install NTFS drivers in Mac OSX allowing me to write to the hard drive.   ol liIs this true?/li liAre there reasons I should not do this?/li liIf there is no drawbacks to not doing this what are the best drivers to install and where do I find them?/li /ol  I ask this because being new to Mac and OSX I want to ensure I do not want to risk messing up my hard drive.   <answer130415> Yes, you can install software that lets you read/write to NTFS partitions. There is both free and paid software, and I recommend installing ntfs-3g with Homebrew.  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)" brew install fuse4x &amp;&amp; brew install ntfs-3g sudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.orig sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs /code/pre  Run codebrew info fuse4x-kext/code and you should be given two lines based on your version that you need to run. Run these lines in Terminal, then eject and remount the disk.  <answer130416> h2Enable ntfs write support in Mavericks/h2  You can enable write support for ntfs in Mavericks.   I have linked to instructions on how to do this, but the gist of it is to edit the /etc/fstab file and add a line for each ntfs drive you want to write to:  precode LABEL=device-name  none    ntfs    rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  changing "device-name" to the name of your ntfs drive.  This is a per device hack.  hr  h2Third party software/h2  Alternatively, there is a lot of third party software to give you full ntfs support, such as Paragon NTFS, or the open source NTFS-3G for FUSE which is utilized in the closed source Tuxera NTFS, or an old standard from Thursby Software, DAVE   hr  h2MacPorts/h2  NTFS-3G and OSXFUSE are available for a free, package managed source or binary installation using emthe/em missing package manager for OS X, MacPorts, which is strongmature/strong, strongstable/strong and strongfully supported/strong, unlike alternative package management solutions for OS X. It is based off of FreeBSD's ports system, which is based off the finest package management system known to exist, of course I mean, NetBSD's pkgsrc. It won't let you down!  Installing MacPorts, NTFS-3G and OSXFUSE is simple enough once xcode (for Mavericks 10.9 xcode_5.1.1.dmg) is installed. Install xcode, and then enter these commands in Terminal.app :  precode curl -Ok https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2  tar xf MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2  cd MacPorts-2.2.1  ./configure  make  sudo make install #not war!  cd ..  rm -rf Macports-*  sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate  export PATH=$HOME/macports/bin:$HOME/macports/sbin:$PATH  export MANPATH=$HOME/macports/share/man:$MANPATH  sudo port -vsc install ntfs-3g     # osxfuse is a dependency, macports will install it for you when you instsall ntfs-3g  diskutil quiet repairPermissions / /code/pre  MacPorts is worth getting to know as it is a mature package manager for OS X that maintains thousands of open source software commands, utilities, and applications. It will not interfere with any other package system you happen to use, and it is very easy to completely remove, if necessary.   If for whatever reason you need to remove MacPorts...  h3to completely uninstall MacPorts/h3  precode sudo port -dfp uninstall --follow-dependencies installed   sudo port -dfp uninstall all   sudo rm -rf /opt/local     sudo rm -rf /Library/Tcl/macports* /code/pre  Really, its good stuff.  <comment152874> Homebrew... I have seen that mentioned quite a bit here on Ask Different... hmm... thanks for the tip ;-) <comment152879> "using *the* missing package manager" Are you *trying* to start a Homebrew vs MacPorts? ;) <comment152880> I hear the bell... I come out swingin'... its instinct. ;-) <comment152881> that is not the complete removal of macports see the [Macports guide](https://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.macports.uninstalling.html) for the complete rm command needed
