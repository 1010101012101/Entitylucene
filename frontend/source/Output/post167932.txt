Keyboard shortcut for replace and find next in textmate <body> The kbd⌘/kbd + kbdG/kbd finds the next occurrence. kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⇧/kbd + kbdF/kbd does NOT do the right thing: it brings up the Find/Replace dialog - and if you just hit kbd↩/kbd it does not properly default to Replace and Find. I am NOT going to mouse over to manually click on it since this is a highly frequent activity.  So then what is the way to do the find/replace just with the keyboard?  <comment232172> I have dumped TextMate - and this was a leading cause.  Instead am enjoying MacVim.
