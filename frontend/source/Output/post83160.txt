Moutain Lion - New line character in notification <body> Do we have any newline character that we can insert in Mountain Lion's Notification Center. I try to append code\n/code but it doesn't work.  What I am trying to do here is to write a plugin for alfred. And I use codeecho 'test\nnewline'/code but it doesn't work. I intend to write this before but it may confuses people with alfred so I didn't write it down :)  <answer83287> It's not clear how you are trying to display the notifications, but this works for me:  precodeterminal-notifier -message $'a\nb' /code/pre  code-title $'a\nb'/code is not displayed on multiple lines though (even if you replace code\n/code with NEXT LINE (NEL)).  <comment95887> Could you be a little more specific? Development questions are actually off-topic here and are better suited for StackOverflow. <comment95945> Are you looking to influence the spacing of distinct notifications or embed a character within one notification? A picture of what you want or more detailed use case might help us find you an answer or decide if this is on-topic here. On a user level, notification center isn't something we generally have an API to influence.
