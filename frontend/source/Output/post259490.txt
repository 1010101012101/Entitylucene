Use iPhone as a terminal <body> I don't want any sign-in, no Apple Store, no iCloud, no Apple nothing. Just want to use my iPhone as an internet terminal. The phone is setup to wireless connect to a Telstra 4g Air and it shows router @ dhcp address and then wants domain or ID. what does it need to be an internet terminal.  <comment324658> Hi David, could you please clarify what you mean by terminal? Should it be a hotspot for other devices? Do you simply want to browse the web using your iPhone via the Telstra? <comment324672> I use *Serverauditor* to ssh into my servers. I don't think you can accomplish exactly what you want without jailbreak.
