Change display resolution on a standard account? <body> I have an old Mac Pro Mid 2010 running macOS Sierra. There are two accounts on it: an admin account that I only use for things like installing software, and a standard account that I use for everything else.    My problem is that the display resolution that macOS defaults to is incorrect. What I have been doing is going into the admin account, setting the correct resolution, and then switching back to the standard account.  However, I'd like to be able to cut the admin account out of this process entirely, and change the display resolution on the standard account.    Is there any way I can set macOS so the standard account is allowed to change the resolution?    Thanks!
