What's the range of proper operating temperatures for a 6-Core Intel Xeon 2 x 2.93 GHz MacPro5,1? <body> What's the range of proper operating temperatures for a 6-Core Intel Xeon   2 x 2.93 GHz MacPro5,1?  I'm getting idling temperatures of 77ºC at the CPUs, so I believe I'm having issues with thermal paste and/or fans.  <comment320671> I can't provide a 'stock' answer, as I have a 4,1 upgraded to 5,1 with dual 6-core Westmeres, but mine idles at approx 60° CPU-A, 45° CPU-B. I had a question regarding the discrepancy between the two, which doesn't have a canonical answer but might be 'by design' - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/243643/mac-pro-cpu-temperature-discrepancy
