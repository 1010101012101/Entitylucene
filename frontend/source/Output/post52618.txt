How can I show typing keyboard in record screen <body> When I record the screen on a Mac, how can I show keyboard typing in the same image (as shown below)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LzRMn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there particular screen recording software or settings that will do this?  <answer52635> I believe this is a part of Screenflow, which costs $99, but does have a trial available.  OS X does have a limited ability to do this, but it only shows modifier keys, like Shift, Ctrl, Command, etc. If you're interested in that, it's in System Preferences  Universal Access, under the Keyboard tab. Turn sticky keys on, and then push "Display pressed keys on screen". I don't think that's what you want, but you can check that out as well.  <answer52636> I also use Screenflow, but there are also a few standalone apps for that like Keycastr and Mousepos√©.  <answer52637> You could try showing the on screen keyboard; this can be accessed from the language menu item  <comment226467> This is a great quick solution for some use cases! <comment254577> keycastr is awesome, free and open source! Pro tip: you can drag the display where ever you like. You're not limited to just the lower left corner. <comment261300> keycastr looks great <comment301792> Just wanted to let you know that Keycastr has issues with keymaps different than QWERTY (AZERTY and DVORAK for example)
