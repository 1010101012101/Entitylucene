Web Sharing (Apache) won't turn on in Lion <body> I'm unable to enable web sharing via codeSystem Preferences &gt; Sharing/code.  When I click it to turn it on the light turns yellow but then goes back to gray.  I did some Googling and found that many people solved this problem by removing changes in their codehttpd.conf/code.  This is my codels /etc/apache2/*.conf*/code:  precode/etc/apache2/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/httpd_ACSServer.conf /etc/apache2/httpd_devicemanagement.conf /etc/apache2/httpd_podcastlibrary.conf /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.default /code/pre  I tried replacing codehttpd.conf/code with codehttpd.conf.default/code but it didn't fix the problem.  <answer65116> Check the Apache logs with Applications  Utilities  Console. Inside Console, expand code/var/log/code to see the Apache2 log files. You might see a message in error_log.  Without any messages, it is a wild goose chase. Here, last time Apache did not log any messages it was the port 80 being occupied by another process.  <comment76486> /var/log/apache2/error_log should contain more details on problems Apache encounters when failing to start. <comment131629> Try `sudo apachectl start` on the command line. See if that works. If that doesn't work `sudo apachectl configtest` will display the errors in your config filesâ€¦ <comment132745> This worked for me, helped me to track down a failing passenger install after moving from rvm to rbenv. Totally forgot I had set that up local for apache.
