"This item is temporarily unavailable" When Installing Yosemite <body> I have erased my HD and tried to install OS Yosemite on MacBook Pro mid 2009. But keep getting this message "This item is temporarily unavailable." I've tried many proposed solutions but none seem to work. Any one experienced a similar problem?  <answer228942> Let me preface this: it's possible that this solution doesn't work entirely, and that you'll need a version of the installer that has a full copy of OS X (instead of downloading it from the internet on the fly.)  With that said, here's the issue. Your Apple ID (and therefore purchases) are not associated with the computer you're trying to install to since it's a clean install. Therefore, it doesn't know you've "purchased" Yosemite previously, and since it's no longer on the app store, isn't giving you access. What you need to do is reassociate your Apple ID with that computer. The recommended solution is to log into icloud.com.  Alternatively (or if that doesn't work), you can download it from another computer with a working version of OS X and then execute the installer from there (or create a bootable installer from there.)  Small side question: why not install El Cap?  <answer229045> Finally the problem solved... I have noticed there is no Yosemite update purchased in my App Store account! So looked in the accounts of my family members and found one in my son's account. I used his account in the installation screen and it worked. Thanks all who tried to help :)  <comment279202> Install the original OS from DVD, then you'll be able to access the store to download Yosemite, assuming it's in your purchase list.  Unless it is in your purchase history, it will always be unavailable. <comment279223> I don't have DVD of the original OS and my DVD driver didn't work .. <comment279227> I've tried the iCloud login first, didn't work...I've created a bootable disk on external drive which is available for OS lion only .. Didn't wok. Why not El Cap? Because when trying to install from the recovery screen, it goes to installing Yosemite by default and cannot change that <comment279228> Then it's a trip to the Apple Store, I think. I doubt you'll get an 09 Mac to boot from USB <comment279229> Well.. We don't have Apple Store here in Kuwait :), I hope I will find some solution <comment279276> @Yousef You can create bootable volumes/installers for any version of OSX. Are you using Internet Recovery? That would explain why it's defaulting to Yosemite, as Internet Recovery uses the version of OS X that came with your Mac. <comment310242> Perhaps there is a apple premium reseller instead of an apple store? <comment315939> use command+option+r <comment329490> @Timmerz It's working. <comment337506> how were you able to login to your app store?
