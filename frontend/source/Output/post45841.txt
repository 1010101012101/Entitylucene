Xcode 4.2 Snow Leopard Doesn't Install <body> My mac crashed and I am trying to install Xcode 4.2 again, but it doesn't work.  The GUI shows an 'The Installation Failed' error.  In the console a few messages stick out to me. They are:  The domain/default pair of (com.apple.iPhoneSDKInstaller, showAdvancedInstaller) does not exist  The Package "OtherDevDocumentation,pkg" is untrusted. CSSMERR_TP_CERT_EXPIRED  Sometimes it says it can't find the developer tools as well.  When I press Get Info on the Xcode.mpkg inside the DMG file, It says it is only 520KB. Is that supposed to happen?  Can anyone help me fix this issue?  Thanks, Ashley  <answer45845> There's a couple things you could try. I had this error when Xcode 4 was first released.  First of all, have you tried rebooting? That solved the problem for me.  Also, in case rebooting doesn't work, just redownload the SDK. It might have gotten corrupted during download.  <answer46400> got similar problem here with 10.6 + combo update installed.  after runing software update and installing something called "apple installer update" (com.apple.pkg.update.softwareinstallerupdate.1.0), xcode installer works just fine.  <answer46425> Just change date to January 2012 or something, it will install just fine. The certificate expired in March.  Updated, steps:  ol liturn off automatic synchronization of date &amp; time  /li lichange actual date of the system to 01.01.2012 (for example, prior to 26.03.2012) /li liinstall the Xcode /li liturn the automatic synchronization back on./li /ol  <comment52298> I've tried both those things and no luck. <comment52299> @AshleyStaggs: Then I'd just contact Apple.  Sounds like something with your system. <comment53016> Did you try installing Xcode under a different user account? <comment53165> Welcome to Ask Different.  Can you expand on your answer perhaps with corroborating information?  I would also consider turning off Date Time updates over NTP <comment53253> Wooooo. Thank you SOOOOO much. Why would Apple still be distributing something that won't work anymore? <comment54143> Ashley: You're welcome. <comment59361> It worked! Thank you very much.
