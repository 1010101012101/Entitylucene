Memory test that fails with a different address each time <body> I had problems (strange patterns on the display and reboots) with my Late 2011 Macbook Pro, so I ran Apple Hardware Test on my computer, and it found memory errors. The thing is that every time  I run the AHT, the error is slightly different. The first time, I got:     4MEM/62/40000000: 0x83a65498   The second time:     4MEM/62/40000000: 0x836dc298   I then swapped my two memory sticks and got this error:     4MEM/62/40000000: 0x842e1198   I am assuming that the hex number is the address where the test failsâ€¦  It always takes about 13.5 minutes of tests for the error to appear. Rambler also found an error during one pass of tests out of two:     FAILURE! Data mismatch at local BUFA address 0x000000012479b930, BUFB   address 0x00000001c96da130 BUFA Data: 0xffffffff80000000, BUFB Data:   0xffffdfff80000000   Memtest86 did not find any problem after 4 passes.  Because the error is different each time, I was wondering if I should suspect something else than a memory stick being bad, something like the memory controller.  strongUPDATE/strong:  However, I am not getting any error message, if I run the AHT while there is only one memory stick in my MBP.  <answer120595> I haven't been able to find documentation of what these fields mean.  However, given that memory failures that I've seen and those posted by others all appear to be around "address" 0x842XXXXX, I suspect that this is not in fact the address. It may be the pattern being written to some address when the failure occurred.  The field where you have a value of 62 seems to be the only one that varies significantly. It may be that this value represents the address to some very course degree (eg. maybe 1-64 could represent one DIMM and 65-128 the other; or maybe odd numbers vs even numbers).  It would be nice if Apple would document these very basic and useful error code formats.
