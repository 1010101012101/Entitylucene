MBP first generation Service Battery <body> My MacBook Pro is throwing me a message "Service Battery" and coconutBattery tells me I have 4007 mAh instead of 5450 mAh.  Is there a way to pump it back up or is that impossible?  I was looking around on the Internet but the Apple Store does not display a built-in MacBook Pro 13 inch battery.  Should I replace mine? And if so, where is the best place to look for since Apple does not have them theirselves?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/znMNJ.png" alt="Coconut Battery"  <answer84809> Battery degradation is normal, and seeing that your battery is almost 4 years old has went through 820 cycles, you battery retention is still quite good. Degradation of battery is irreversible.  If you really want to get a fresh battery, you can take it to an Apple store. It'll cost somewhere around $150.  Apple replace defective notebook battery only within 3 years of purchase with AppleCare, so you wouldn't get that benefit.  <comment97681> Can you tell me @Enrico why my MBP 13" is not in Apple's list on the site you've provided me? <comment97797> @Robuust it falls under the general "Notebook Owners" heading. The link below that are for notebook that has replaceable batteries. They can just buy new batteries from those links.
