Finder search in El Capitan wields weird results if file/dir name contains numbers <body> We organise our work by so called job numbers. However, Finder search on macOS El Capitan does not always find file/dir names. I managed to establish the following pattern:  ul li1: works/li li12: works/li li123: works/li li1234: fails/li li1234_: fails/li li1234_t: works/li li1234_te: works/li li1234_tes: works/li li1234_test: works/li /ul  I don't have this problem on Sierra and when searching via Spotlight. I can work around this by always prepending codename:/code but I would like to understand why it doesn't work. So codename:1234/code actually works.
