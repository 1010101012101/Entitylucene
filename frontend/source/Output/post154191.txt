Holding down backspace on iPhone <body> Holding down backspace on iPhone deletes about six characters per second.   However, after about three consecutive seconds of holding down backspace, entire words start disappearing by the pair at a rate of about three pairs per second!  How can I disable the "feature" that starts chomping two words at a time a few times per second when holding down backspace on my iPhone?   iOS 7.1.2, iPhone 5s  <answer154201> There is no way to disable the fast delete. There is an undo command, however, for when you've deleted too much. When the keyboard is up, shake the phone. A popup asks if you want to undo.
