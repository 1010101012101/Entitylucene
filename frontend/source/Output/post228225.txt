MacBook Air won't boot up <body> So my 2011 has been working fine forever and since yesterday it won't boot past the screen you see attached.   I tried starting in safe mode (command + shift) and it does nothing  I was able to get in to the disk utility and checked the disks and it said everything was ok.  I also tried single user mode but it gets stuck loading drivers.  What else can I do short of an Apple Store trip?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BoAPZ.jpg" alt="stuck screen "  <comment278361> Can you boot it in "Verbose Mode"?  Hit Command+V while booting.  Post a screen shot (use your phone or other camera) so we can see what the message is. <comment278372> Have you tried reinstalling OS X? <comment278448> So I ended up going in to the Genius Bar and they tried a variety of ways to wake it up. None worked. Something along the lines that my OS X boot file wasn't found. In the end they had to reinstall the newest OS which wiped out everything I had on the computer. Most was backed up in the cloud not everything.
