Macbook Air mid 2013 not charging <body> I have a macbook air mid 2013 model. It worked with no problem till now. Today when I opened the macbook it shows no charge symbol(I mean when you press power button it shows a battery icon in a black screen like iPhone does when its battery is drained).   I connected the charger but there is no led light(green or amber). It is not detecting the charger . I checked the same charger in another macbook.The charger works perfectly.   I tried doing SMC and PRAM reset. Since there is no power in the machine nothing happens. Please help.  The OS is Mavericks.  I got the macbook in London and I am in India now. Will the Apple warranty work internationally?.  <answer129201> Finally, I gave it to the Apple authorised repair centre. They told me IO chip and wire had to be replaced. Since it was in warranty it got it repaired for free.  <comment151246> Glad to hear it worked out!  For anyone checking, yes, AppleCare does work internationally.  I think the biggest challenge is usually finding a service location but AppleCare should be able to direct you to one.
