I haven't found any shortcut or application on my Mac which provide such functionality.  I would like to know the keyboard shortcut.  <answer56171> ul likbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdShift ⇧/kbd-kbd3/kbd will save a screenshot of the whole screen to your desktop. kbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdControl ⌃/kbd-kbdShift ⇧/kbd-kbd3/kbd copies it to your clipboard./li likbd⌘/kbd-kbd⇧/kbd-kbd4/kbd lets you drag to take a shot of a portion of the screen, or press kbdSpace/kbd to select a specific window. Add kbdControl ⌃/kbd to the mix to copy to to the clipboard./li /ul  You can view and change these in the Keyboard pane of System Preferences, under the emKeyboard Shortcuts/em tab: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XGyUf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment64496> sweet!  I also found the app, it has the somewhat obscure name of 'grab' <comment64497> The app is borderline useless, it does exactly what the short cuts do but in a gui rather than short cuts <comment64498> @XAleXOwnZX Which makes it useful to people like my mom who don't like to use or memorize keyboard shortcuts. <comment64499> And to people like me, who have been using Macs since the 1980's, but can't keep up with which keyboard shortcuts have changed this year.  :P <comment64503> opening grab every time isn't much easier lol
