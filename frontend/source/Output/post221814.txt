Time Machine Backup Failing with Error 11 <body> I've been trying to run a Time Machine backup for the last couple of days (OSX 10.7.5 and Porsche LaCie 2TB); however, it has been constantly failing. Console is producing the following crash messages  precode16-01-01 3:56:47.345 PM ReportCrash: DebugSymbols was unable to start a spotlight query: spotlight is not responding or disabled. 16-01-01 3:56:49.601 PM com.apple.backupd: Indexing a file failed.

This solved the issue with the volume bitmap. After this, I started another backup attempt, anticipating success. What was different about this was that the previous failures would tell me that it was backing up 40 GB, but then it would 40 GB and continue getting larger, unto about 130 GB, and then crash. This backup started by saying that it was backing up the entirety of my drive (roughly 400 GB). Much to my dismay, it got to about 40 GB, and then crashed with the error messages that I referenced. What can I do to correct these errors, and successfully backup my system?   <answer249073> It took a while, but I found that I had some corrupted file that kept crashing the backup. Once that file was gone, the backup went smoothly.  <comment268655> Why are you still on 10.7.5? Is there a reason you haven't updated? <comment268657> @IronCraftMan It's mostly a result of it keeps slipping my mind. One of these days, I'll get around to upgrading to El Capitan. I also finally got all of my programming things to play nicely, and there's a small part of me that fears an upgrade will break things.
