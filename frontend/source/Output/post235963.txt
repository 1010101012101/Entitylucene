Stop-motion screenshots <body> I need to screen capture, either full screen or a selected area, for a long time; something in the order of 12 hours or more.  I then need to compress that time down so anyone watching it can see the entire time-period over just a few minutes.  Quality is really unimportant, we are simply watching for huge changes that should occur gradually over time, but for some reason are 'sticking' for hours, then jumping.  I once tried this before using QuickTime, but I couldn't really figure out how to make it record at maybe 1 frame per minute but playback at a frame per second.  Does anyone know if QuickTime can do this, or if not, of any software that can?  I really need to be able to get my final file down to something that YouTube would be happy with, so I can share it with interested parties.br I have Final Cut Pro &amp; Compressor, if they would help, though I'm most certainly no expert when it comes to video editing &amp; formats.
