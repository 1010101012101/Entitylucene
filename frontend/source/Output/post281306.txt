Mail client on iOS not putting emails into Sent folder <body> I have both iPhone (recent iOS version) and iPad (never updated iOS). In last month I connected both to my PlusNet account (I am in the U.K.).  The Mail client sends emails OK and the recipient seems to get them. But they don't go in to my Sent folder.  I have set both up to map folders to the server Sent, Deleted and Drafts folders. But this is no use till they retain sent emails to start with!  I also have Outlook on a new Windows laptop, connected to the same PlusNet account. This retained the Sent mails up to 11 April, then they stopped going in to Sent mail. 11 April could be about the date I set up the two iOS devices. Accessing the email account with Webmail shows no "Sent" items from the ones sent recently (via new laptop or iOS devices).  The configuration all looks right and can send and receive mails OK on each device. Has anyone seen the same thing?
