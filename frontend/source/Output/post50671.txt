How to speed up an iPad 2? <body> My iPad 2 (32gb) is about one year old and he is getting very slow. I've tried restarting the iPad and quitting all apps but with no real success.br There is about 5 GB of free storage space.   Any other ideas on how to speed things up?  <answer50673> Have your tried backing it up to your computer, then restoring it? That might help. Make sure it's backed up.  <comment58115> What do you mean by "slow"? Do you notice a big difference between now and a few weeks earlier? <comment58116> I'll give one example of "slow"/"sluggish": when I open safari it sometimes takes ~10sec to "load". I.e., until you see the open pages and the search bar is active.  To answer your second question: yes, I think this sluggishness started in the last few weeks. <comment58117> What did you do the last few weeks? Installed something? Perform a jailbreak? Is it only Safari? Or other apps too? <comment58121> no jailbreak. I installed a few apps here and there. I think it's mostly safari but also other apps (you can really see it on the Twitter and Facebook apps).
