sysctl net.inet.udp.randomize_ports <body> Does anyone know the purpose of the OS X specific codesysctl/code of codenet.inet.udp.randomize_ports/code? From looking at my firewall logs I can see that it ends up causing macOS 10.12.5 to use UDP ephemeral ports outside of the codenet.inet.ip.portrange.first/code/codehifirst/code and codenet.inet.ip.portrange.last/code/codehilast/code range (which is the same as IANA range). And the source code (/bsd/netinet/in_pcb.c and /bsd/netinet/udp_usrreq.c) for the kernel doesnt have any relevant comments.  edit: Also it seems like changing this sysctl from the default of 1 to 0 doesn't really do anything. It will still continue to use random UDP ports and after a reboot it changes itself back to 1.
