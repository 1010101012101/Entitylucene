Switching between RDP sessions on OS X El Capital <body> OS X El Capitan 10.11.3  I use Microsoft Remote Desktop 8.0.26  and many times open multiple sessions  The only way to switch these sessions i see is by clicking using mouse and i can't find any keyboard shortcuts to switch between multiple session  Is there any way to switch between sessions?  Regards  <answer230060> Same key command as any Mac app…  kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd ` /kbd  which cycles through all open windows [in RDP's case, that also includes the 'picker'.]br kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd ` /kbd will reverse the direction.  kbd ` /kbd seems to move around depending on which nationality keyboard you have, on a UK keyboard it's left of kbd z /kbd.  sup Perhaps others could add in the location for other keyboard layouts… /sup
