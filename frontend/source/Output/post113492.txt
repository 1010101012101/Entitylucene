Why do Facetime and Messages ask me for a password at random moments? <body> Facetime and Messages have started asking me for my username and password at seemingly random moments.  I don't use either application and have not added them to my login's autostart programs.  This is happening on 10.8.5.  <comment133173> Did you change your iCloud password? <comment133180> Not very recently, no. <comment133181> Understand that I find it odd because I have never used those applications and never planned to. I don't know why they even ask for my username and password. <comment216239> The message boxes still appear every now and then and ask for my username and password. I still don't use either application.
