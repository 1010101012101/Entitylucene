How do I delete network interfaces <body> I am still a little new to the macOS world, so my question might be easily solved.br I have been doing some networking with my MacBook Air and noticed some things I did not understand/thought that they should be different.    When I run codeifconfig/code I see many network adapters, and with many I mean way more than I anticipated.  precodelo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384     options=1203&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TXSTATUS,SW_TIMESTAMP&gt;     inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000      inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128      inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1      nd6 options=201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt; gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether c8:69:cd:af:4f:bc      inet6 fe80::1832:448c:e682:a8a8%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x5      inet 152.67.132.28 netmask 0xfffffc00 broadcast 152.67.132.255     nd6 options=201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt;     media: autoselect     status: active en1: flags=922&lt;BROADCAST,SMART,PROMISC,SIMPLEX&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 9a:00:05:1b:4b:3f      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive p2p0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2304     ether 0a:69:cd:af:4f:bc     media: autoselect     status: inactive awdl0: flags=8943&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1484     ether fa:1f:bf:37:c7:35      inet6 fe80::f81f:bfff:fe37:c735%awdl0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x8      nd6 options=201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt;     media: autoselect     status: active bridge0: flags=8822&lt;BROADCAST,SMART,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=63&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 9a:00:05:1b:4b:3f      Configuration:         id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0         maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200         root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0         ipfilter disabled flags 0x2     member: en1 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 6 priority 0 path cost 0     nd6 options=201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt;     media: &lt;unknown type&gt;     status: inactive utun0: flags=8050&lt;POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2000     inet6 fe80::4974:b78a:7731:c82a%utun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xa      nd6 options=201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt; utun1: flags=8050&lt;POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1380     inet6 fe80::9ffc:672f:768f:f232%utun1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xb      nd6 options=201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt; utun2: flags=8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1380     inet6 fe80::733c:91be:79df:7b4b%utun2 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xc      nd6 options=201&lt;PERFORMNUD,DAD&gt; /code/pre  lo0 and en0 are clear to me but the others are not.  However, What are the different internet connection types used by ifconfig and ipconfig? and Unexpected interfaces in ifconfig have cleared a lot of this up for me.   However, when I started writing this I only had utun0 and utun1 and now utun2 has appeared!  strongWhat I'd like to know is:/strong Can I disable/remove them since I seem to not use them? If so, how?   codeifconfig delete/code doesn't seem to work and codeifconfig up/down/codehas no effect.  <answer281479> These are for the most part physical network adapters which exist within your computer. Even if you remove them all from System Preferences -- Network, codeifconfig/code will still report them all.

The results were exactly the same.  This is the default configuration with six listed interfaces  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wsCau.png" alt="This is the default configuration with six listed interfaces"  This is the default configuration with six listed interfaces  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ti1Ir.png" alt="This is the default configuration with six listed interfaces"  As I mentioned the codeifconfig/code output was strongexactly identical/strong whether the interfaces had been deleted or not.  If you'd like to go deeper codenetworksetup/code gives you more human readable output. For instance codenetworksetup -listallhardwareports/code yields:  precodeHardware Port: Ethernet Device: en0 Ethernet Address: c8:2a:14:33:ca:46  Hardware Port: Apple USB Ethernet Adapter Device: en4 Ethernet Address: 08:6d:41:e6:e7:48  Hardware Port: FireWire Device: fw0 Ethernet Address: c8:2a:14:ff:fe:cb:96:16  Hardware Port: Wi-Fi Device: en1 Ethernet Address: e4:ce:8f:2f:b7:aa  Hardware Port: Bluetooth PAN Device: en3 Ethernet Address: e4:ce:8f:2f:b7:ab  Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 1 Device: en2 Ethernet Address: d2:00:1c:b9:61:60  Hardware Port: Thunderbolt Bridge Device: bridge0 Ethernet Address: ca:2a:14:33:ea:00  VLAN Configurations /code/pre  While you can't add or remove hardware ports with codenetworksetup/code, you can enable and disable devices with codenetworksetup -removepreferredwirelessnetwork &lt;device name&gt; &lt;network&gt;/code  You can get a full list of the available codenetworksetup/code commands with codeman networksetup/code and some nice examples.  If you really want to disable the hardware completely so it doesn't show up, get out your Torx screwdrives and a solder gun. Why would someone want to do so? For the same reasons, one might disconnect iSight Camera or the microphone. If you aren't going to use an interface (particularly a wireless one), it's a constant security hasard.  For VMware and other virtual machines, you'll want to remove their code.kext/code extensions which install virtual interfaces. While I'm on board for disconnecting microphones and video cameras, I don't think removing network interfaces would help much as your computer is vulnerable as soon as it's online. If I did want a truly secure computer, I'd make sure it simply had no networking hardware inside or on the motherboard. This probably means stepping back a few generations.  This kind of secure box should then be kept in a physically secure location. I know a lawyer with a safe room in his office where just such a computer stands. It never touches the internet or any other networking device. If he wants copy out of it, he doesn't use a removable device such as a USB card or a floppy drive. He prints. If he wants a digital version, someone scans and OCR's the printed output.  <comment353938> Please open About this Mac...System Report...Network to get the BSD device names and the respective physical or tun/tap devices. To get rid of some of the devices some surgical drilling with a Black & Decker (or a Bosch/Makita) is required. To get your second question answered (netstat) divert it from the question here to a second question. <comment353958> Thanks I will look there. And I guess this is normal for a mac. The only problem is I don't own a black and decker but I think I should be able to perform the surgery with some bosch tools. <comment353960> yet you're on the Black & Decker site - Bosch is off-topic :/ <comment354066> hm... maybe I will have to invest in Black&Decker....    But jokes aside - I looked into the System Report: There are only two interfaces, the Wifi `en0` and a VPN that I configured nothing more <comment354758> First of all thanks for the good answer! I wanted to remove/disable some of these network devices since I dont use them and I often do stuff like manual IPv6 configurations and since normal IPv6 configurations are a bit unwieldy when using only one interface I wanted to remove unused clutter. I guesss I will have to live with that. The only thing I am still a bit confused about is that `utun2 interface that just "appeared out of nowhere" <comment355161> Just wanted to confirm that these references to physically removing these interfaces from the laptop being the only way to make these interfaces disappear are not just jokes. I find this issue incredibly frustrating. I have absolutely no interest in seeing network devices that I am certain I will never use, and MacOS is the only distribution that I know of that does not provide a means to ignoring unneeded interfaces.
