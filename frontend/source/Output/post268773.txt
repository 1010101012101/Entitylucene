Problems while connected to external monitor <body> I connect my (13,1) MacBook Pro (late 2016) 13" to a Lenovo Thinkvision X1 (60E2-GAR1EU) 27" monitor using the supplied USB-C cable. I have experienced three issues. 1. When I leave them connected, my MBP gets really hot (overheated?). 2. When my MBP is left in sleep mode for hours (typically overnight), it doesn't wake up and needs to be turned off and on. It gives an error report of "sleep wake failure". 3. If none of the above happens, I have to unplug and plug again, and open the lid, then close the lid to get them work together. Could anyone advise me on this connection issue? Can it be the lack of specific driver or an macSierra problem? I checked out Lenovo's website they just offer support for Windows. Thanks.
