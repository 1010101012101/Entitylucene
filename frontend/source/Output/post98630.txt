iPad and iPhone calendar: same settings, different google calendars <body> Standard calendar app in iPad and iPhone show different calendars, while settings on "preferences/email, contacts and calendars" and in the standard calendar on both devices are equal, as far as i can see.br • On my iPad (mini iOs 6.1.3), my google(exchange) account shows just 1 calendar (with my google-address as name)br • On my iPhone (4s iOs 6.1.3), my google(exchange) account shows strong6/strong calendars (with specified names, as online)br iCloud and others on both devices show same calendars. How to let both devices show the same calendars?brbr em(and yes, on both devices i've already went to www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect and selected all ;)/em  <comment115830> Do you have a question ? <comment115860> haha... ask a question, what a great idea! ;) <comment116169> What version of iOS are you using on each device? And you have them set up exactly the same way in the Settings app on each device? <comment116212> @tubedogg - thanks for a reaction! iOs 6.1.3.  settings on "preferences/email, contacts and calendars" and in the standard calendar on both devices are equal, as far as i can see.
