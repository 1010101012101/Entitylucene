Safari 9 Top Sites shortcut key gone missing or changed? <body> Until version 9, pressing option+command+1 would bring up Top Sites. That does not work in version 9.  I see menu bar Bookmarks  Show Top Sites with no shortcut key listed next to it. That is worrisome.  However, in Preferences  Tabs I see an option named "Use ⌘-1 thru ⌘-9 to switch tabs". When I uncheck that, I get the old behavior of loading my top 9 favorite bookmarks instead of jumping to a tab. Because of this, I hold out hope there is an undocumented shortcut key for jumping to Top Sites.  <answer209047> Why not just add one yourself?  ol liOpen System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts and click add./li liSelect Safari, enter ‘Show Top Sites’ for the menu title and enter a keyboard shortcut./li /ol  This adds the shortcut to the menu option:                                      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9fNrl.png" width="338"  <answer209613> Starting version 9.0, the shortcut for opening a Bookmark was remapped. You must now press the following key combination: kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+(# of bookmark).  <answer212380> "However, in Preferences  Tabs I see an option named "Use ⌘-1 thru ⌘-9 to switch tabs".

Thank you. <comment252117> @Jeff It was more of a conversational introduction to the answer than a direct question towards you :) <comment252938> Excellent info! Can you figure out the new mapping (if any) to the old option+command+1 that loads Top Sites?
