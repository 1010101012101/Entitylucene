Restoring 10.6.7 wallpapers <body> This may sound a bit silly and I hope it's not off-topic, but... I'm looking for a specific wallpaper that was present in OS X 10.6.7 (an Ansel Adams-style black-and-white landscape with the sun hidden behind some very remarkable clouds). It is no longer present in OS X Lion.   Strangely, it is also not a part of the OS X 10.6 wallpapers pack.  Is there a comprehensive resource from which old OS X wallpapers can be accessed?  <answer43034> If its the mountains in black and white with the sun behind clouds.. It's in this pack: http://www.redmondpie.com/download-os-x-snow-leopard-wallpapers/  <comment48917> +1, good find. Is that one called "Winter Sunrise?" Also liked the Mojave and Sea Mist pictures.
