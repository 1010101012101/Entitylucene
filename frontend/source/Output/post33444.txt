How do you reset screen zoom to zero? <body> How do you reset screen zoom to zero?br I mean the one you do with control-mouse wheel, I know you can reset it with the wheel again until it gets to 1:1 but it would be nice to have a keyboard shortcut to make it 1:1br Is there?  <answer33449> I'd say hold kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd–/kbd. In fact, holding kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd8/kbd will disable it, but once you press it again, it comes back to the old level, therefore kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd–/kbd seems the best solution.  <answer33452> When zoom is enabled in accessibility preferences, kbdcommand/kbd kbdoption/kbd kbd-/kbd is the default shortcut for zooming out, it's not instant, but it's a pretty fast method.  <answer158554> The "Accepted Answer" does not work.  First you have to go into "Accessibility" (type into Spotlight), then click "Zoom", and enable the "Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom" checkbox.
