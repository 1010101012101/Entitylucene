Cloned disk from older MacBook not booting on new MacBook Pro <body> I have an old MacBook (2-3 years old), it is running 10.9.  Last night I cloned the hard drive and tried to use it as a startup disk on my new MacBook Pro (June 2016, with 10.11 installed).  All I got was a no entry sign on startup. How can I make it boot?  <answer253554> No Mac will boot to an OS older than itself, with the exception of models released right on the cusp of a new major OS version.  The drivers for the newer model didn't yet exist.  <comment315504> Welcome to AskDifferent!
