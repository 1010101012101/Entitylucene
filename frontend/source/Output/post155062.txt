Mail - Is there a way to hide the "count" beside specific mailboxes? <body> I'd like to keep my Flagged mailbox visible and I'd still like the regular Inbox to show the count of unread email. However, I'd like to remove the number being displayed beside both the Flagged mailbox and the Junk mailbox. Is there anyway I can easily do this? Thank you much.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/apt7S.png" alt="enter image description here"
