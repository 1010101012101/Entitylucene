iPhone 4S, Forever recover mode? <body> I have an iPhone 4S, and it is in recovery Mode, and when I want to restore it, error (1) pop-up. like in photos below img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jVfO.jpg" alt="Error and forever recover mode"  I did search on Internet, people say it's an electronic part issue, is it true?  <answer170461> According to Apple, error 1 means:      These errors mean that your device or computer may have a hardware issue that's preventing the update or restore from completing.   I would suggest you try:  ul liOther usb ports/li liNot using a usb hub, plug directly to your machine/li liDifferent computer/li liDifferent (preferably original) usb cable/li liUse codeTinyUmbrella/code and its "exit recovery" option (you probably need to put your device in DFU mode first)/li /ul  Also make sure you use the latest version of iTunes  hr  Finally, if everything else fails, then it could be an actual hardware issue according to reports from other users :/  <answer245176> ol liMake sure that you have the latest version of iTunes. /li liCheck for issues with third-party security software. /li liMake sure that your USB cable, computer, and network are reliable. Then try twice more to restore your iPhone. /li liIf you still see the error message, you can check for outdated or modified software or contact Apple Support./li /ol  <comment200337> What did you try so far? <comment200568> @Rob Thank you for your help, I did try all, and used TinyUmbrella(exit recovery, launch server...), nothing changed. many errors accured like 3194... but i solved by editing host file or desactivate Anti-virus and Firewall .... but error (1), when I start the recovering(both from itunes server or local .ipsw), before the finish of the instaling(when the progress bar appears in my Iphone). <comment200570> Thank you for your help, I did try all you said, and used TinyUmbrella(exit recovery, launch server...), nothing changed. many errors accured like 3194... but i solved by editing host file or desactivate Anti-virus and Firewall .... but error (1), when I start the recovering(both from itunes server or local .ipsw), before the finish of the instaling(when the progress bar appears in my Iphone). <comment200578> Did you also try different machines, usb ports and cables? (Sad thing is that I found some references the claim this is a hardware problem and cannot really be fixed. But does not seem like a universal opinion) <comment200846> 1. I did try to install the latest version of ios with the latest version of Itunes. 2. I did try to downgrade to 5.1.1, with redsn0w (0.9.11b1 and 0.9.14b2) but the probleme is I dont have SHSH blobs, because iPhone 4s is A5 version. Any suggestions please <comment200862> First, I would say forget about downgrading and try for the latest version. Try restoring with a completely different computer, just to rule out possible specifics machine issues. Also try with a different cable (get one from a friend or so) <comment201015> I tried restoring with MAC and PC, different cables, no solution, I think it's a Hardware Failure (some says mother board, others Baseband chip). Anyway Thank you LyK, If I'll get the solution i will post it, if you do post it. <comment201017> I am sorry that we did find a solution. I will add the hardware failure as a final explanation. <comment201873> This is the solution, it is failed Apple iPhone 4s U18_RF U20_RF Baseband Power IC. its a cheap chip but to repair it is difficult.(as you can see in this Video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grbGWSV4_ds <comment202283> That's unfortunate. Hope you have someone to help with that repair.
