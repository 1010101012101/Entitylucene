How to make external display go to sleep after xx mins? <body> I'm using my new 2016 12" Macbook as a "desktop" by connecting it to an external display, USB Keyboard/mouse and running it in "clamshell mode". Works beautifully except the display never goes to sleep. I was kinda figuring it would go to sleep just the same way the internal display does but it will stay on for hours if I let it. I did set up a hot-corner to sleep the display and that works fine but that means I always need to do it manually. How can I get this to work so that it acts normally? Do energy saver settings not apply to external displays?   <answer268000> As a first step I would reset both your NVRAM and SMC, as well as double check your Energy Saver settings.  strongResetting the NVRAM on an early-2016 12" MacBook model/strong  Follow these steps:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it wonâ€™t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongResetting the SMC on an early-2016 12" MacBook model/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  strongEnergy Saver Settings/strong  You don't specify in your question how you've configured your Energy Saver settings, but you may want to double-check what you've actually set under the Power Adapter tab. I've come across many instances where MacBook users forget that there's two tabs you can configure.  <comment336667> I tred the SMC and PRAM resets and it didn't seem to make any difference. I don't think it's a technical issue preventing the display from sleeping, as I can make it sleep manually using a hot-corner, but rather the energy settings aren't applying to external displays. This may be by design, but I'm not sure which is why I posted here. My Energy Saver settings are defaults, and work as expected when being used as a laptop. <comment336779> The Energy Saver settings should apply to external displays unless the built-in settings of the display override these in some way. What model display do you have? The reason I mention checking Energy Saver settings is that presumably you have your MacBook connected to AC power when you're using your display, so I wanted to make sure that the settings under the Power Adapter tab are in fact what you think they are? I know that seems a bit obvious, but I've come across many users who just didn't realise this. Also, when you refer to Hot Corners, do you mean you're activating your Screen Saver?
