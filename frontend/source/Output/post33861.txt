iPhone 4S stereo sound <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   iPhone 4 - sound only comes out of one speaker       I finally got my iPhone 4S! But when playing a song, I noticed the sound isn't stereo. The right box is doing all the hard box, while the left one is producing a very minimal sound. Is this standard on the iPhone 4S or is it a hardware/software issue?  <answer33862> This is expected - the iPhone 4S does not have stereo speakers. The left "box" is actually a microphone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQJzb.jpg" alt=""  supemimage from apple.com/iphone/specs.html/em/sup  <comment38645> Ok, this was a stupid question :D Thanks a lot! <comment38646> @Michiel it's not entirely stupid - I imagine a lot of new users are confused by it <comment38647> Yeah; use headphones for stereo sound. <comment38649> I'm used to work with an iPhone 3G with broken speakers, so... But thanks! <comment38650> I like this implementation. If I need to shut up my iPhone, I just hold my thumb on that right hole. It's a really effective way to mute the phone. <comment38670> The sound is stereo out the headphone jack so use that jack to drive headphones or a set of stereo speakers.
