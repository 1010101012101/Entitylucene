What should I do when "An error has occurred" when downloading Lion? <body> I'm trying to download the new Mac OS. When click install, the icon pops onto the dock and says Waiting...  After about 5 minutes, it disappears and in the purchased category of the Mac App Store, next to install it says:     An error has occurred   Why is this happening?  strongEdit:/strong  Originally I could not even get the download bar in the purchased section until I reconfigured my router slightly(I'm using a BT Business Hub). I am now able to get the download bar. However, I still get "Waiting..." on the icon and after about 3 minutes, I receive the same error message:     An error has occurred   I still believe that it is a router problem and not the app stores' servers. Has another been able to fix this yet?  Here is a screenshot when I click the install button: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKhfI.png" alt="A screenshot of when I click the install button"  And here is a screenshot after about 2 minutes: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JZCvD.png" alt="A screenshot after about 2 minutes"  <answer17817> Because a lot of Mac users are probably doing the same download now. It's probably overloaded. After all 4 GB is a good bit bigger than an iTunes song or an iOS app.  <answer17890> Make sure you have downloaded all the latest system updates - there is one which will prepare the mac app store for lion. I had the same problem and it seems to be working now!  <answer18012> I have sorted the issue. I just had to use a different router. The BT Business hub that I previously been using had a problem on it which prevented anything above 2GB do loose connection. This would explain other problems as well.  <answer55202> I had a similar event.  I was able to solve the problem by:  ol liSigning out the app store/li liClosing app store/li liClearing cookies in safari (evidently app store uses safari's cookies)/li liReopen app store/li liSign-in to the App Store/li liPress Option and click Purchases/li liClick Resume on OS X Mountain Lion under Other Purchases/li /ol  Maybe this will help?  <answer126892> Run Console to check the recent logs for more details (look for com.apple.installd).  In example, I had something like:  precodecom.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.installd[69518]) Job appears to have crashed: Abort trap: 6 ReportCrash[69520]: Saved crash report for installd[69518] version 332 to /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/installd_2014*.crash /code/pre  If you see the crash in your logs, then check the backtrace under System Diagnostic Reports, so there is something like:  precodeTerminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver initForReadingWithData:]: incomprehensible archive /code/pre  The reason for that could be that some of the downloaded files are corrupted.  So to solve that, you have to remove these files and try again.  hr  strongSimple solution/strong  ol liQuit your App Store/li liRun Finder./li liGo to (CMD+Shift+G): /private/var/folders./li liTrash all the folders from that folder (e.g. vp, zz)./li liRun App Store and re-try./li /ol  In case something bad happens, restore these removed files from your Trash.  hr  strongAdvanced solution/strong  From Terminal check if you've temporary files here:  precodels -la /private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore /code/pre  And then try to remove them (you may backup them first just in case):  precoderm -frv /private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore /code/pre  And re-try again.  hr  Related:  ul lihttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4483444/li lihttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4234582/li /ul  <answer249037> I had the same problem. I solved my problem by going to code/private/tmp/code (similar to kenord's answer) and trashing all the codelaunch*/code directories.   In retrospect, I think maybe I only needed to remove a launchd-emxxxx/em.emyyyyyy/em folder, which had a red mark on the folder icon.  <comment19483> That might the problem so I will wait a few hours then. If this still occurs I will report back. <comment19668> I have tried this and it has not helped at all, sorry. <comment19669> It seems that it is not servers being overloaded and something else(most probably my router). <comment28073> You won't be able to pinpoint the problem until you try to download the OS from another connection/router configuration. Until then, we cannot safely say if it's Apple's servers (doesn't seem like it if it times out so readily) or your router configuration... <comment148656> Rather than pasting this in several places - would you be open to asking a brief question "How do I troubleshoot a failed download from the Mac App store?" and then posting this in one place? <comment148782> I've pasted it only 2 times as I didn't know which one was more popular and it was related to the issue. Normally one should be marked as duplicate of another one. I had similar problem and simply couldn't find any proper solution, so more avability to the clear solutions then better. Sorry about it. <comment148805> It's all good - just that the system lets us know when dupes are posted. Welcome and thanks for the great posts so far. <comment302801> Awesome man. Its working perfectly now.
