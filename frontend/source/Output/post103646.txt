Tmux wihtin iTerm2: Unable to bind some keyboard combinations <body> I have the following bind-key definitions in my code.tmux.conf/code file:  precodebind-key -n M-I select-pane -U bind-key -n M-K select-pane -D bind-key -n M-J select-pane -L bind-key -n M-L select-pane -R /code/pre  However, they don't work when I open a tmux session inside of ITerm2. It looks like the OS captures those shortcuts and doesn't let tmux act on them.  I have a similar problem when I press  kbdâŒ˜-d/kbd within ITerm (no Tmux here) in that it triggers Mac OS X to close my terminal, even though what I want it is to delete a word in the shell (I have codebindkey -e/code in code.zshrc/code which should take care of that)  Below are my settings in iTerm2: &nbsp; img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/spQxv.png" alt="enter image description here"
