Where to find the Yosemite traffic light icons? <body> Where would I be able to acquire Yosemite's new "traffic light" icons? I have found the codeSystemAppearance.car/code file, but I do not know how to decompress code.car/code files, or if the file even contains the icons.  <answer164154> .car file is special BOM file and the file specification is un-document by apple, this is simulator with Assert.car in iOS.   I found an open source project ThemeEngine PS: I don't test it anymore.  <comment192333> Is there any compiled version of ThemeEngine? I just see a bunch of source code. <comment192335> include release App on GitHub https://github.com/alexzielenski/ThemeEngine/releases <comment192337> Absolutely wonderful! Thank you!
