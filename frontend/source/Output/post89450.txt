How can I download iTunes U courses simultaneously? <body> For example, MIT's 18.01 emSingle Variable Calculus/em, I want do download all the video courses simultaneously instead of clicking each of them(that cute little emfree/em button), how can I do it?  <comment104999> I think you can subscribe to it like podcast, and then all content will be listed, and you can multi-select them and download multiple ones. <comment105067> @ShaneHsu I have multi-selected them,what to do next? <comment105076> Right-click and I believe there would be a menu item that lets you download all of the selected ones. <comment105228> @ShaneHsu I tried,didn't find the menu item.
