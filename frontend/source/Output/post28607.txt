How can I change the Apple ID associated with an iPod Touch? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Unable to change Apple ID on my iPhone       I just bought myself a used iPod Touch - 2nd generation.  The person who previously owned it cleared just about everything off.  strongThe Problem:/strong  I tried to install a new app onto it, but, it asked me for the password to my Apple ID. Seeing as I'm sure the person who sold it to me doesn't want to give me the password to their account, how can I change it to use my account instead of theirs?  I've checked into the different settings but I couldn't find anything on it.  <answer28614> You might find this answer to be helpful for changing the Apple ID on your phone.  To summarize, go to codeSettings/code » codeStore/code » click on the old Apple ID » codeSign out/code » codeSign in/code and enter your own Apple ID.  <comment32891> @nathanGreenstein thanks for the edit :) <comment32892> No problem!
