Password for sparse image stopped working, how can I solve this? <body> I have a question regarding sparse image. One of my family members created a sparse image with a password that is known to us. However, another family member when once logged in tried to copy the files contained in the sparse image in order to save them in another location. Since then, the password we knew is not working.   Is it possible that this action somehow blocked the access?  Is there a possibility that access is blocked if the wrong password is entered too many times?  Does anybody have a suggestion what has happened/how we can solve this? I have tried both key chain (unfortunately, no password is saved there) and time machine (it doesn't go back far enough to still cover the date when this happened).  The strange thing is that the password we were using was working before, and we have never been prompted to enter a new one. I realise that if you lose your password the data is lost, however, I wonder if there is something else going on here. I can't seem to explain what has happened..  I would appreciate ideas and suggestions on what else to try very much. Thanks a lot, Q  <comment311808> Is this a read-only image? If so, what does hdiutil verify myimage.img show? According to the man page the 'verify' verb doesn't work with read-write images.
