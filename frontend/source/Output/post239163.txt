Is it a bug that iTunes doesn't actually tell you what the items are that could not be synced? <body> When you get a sync error (somewhat famous here) - the iPhone tells you to look in iTunes to see what it was that couldn't be synced.   Interestingly enough emiTunes doesn't actually tell you what it was/em that couldn't be synced.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qdhh8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  My question is: strongIs it a bug that iTunes doesn't actually tell you what the items are that could not be synced?/strong  <answer256379> It turns out it is available in iTunes - but not in an obvious place.   Here are the steps:  ol liOpen iTunes:/li liSelect Library/li liSelect 'Movies' or 'Music'/li liGo to the View menu and select View As - List/li liLook at the list of items - and scroll down to the bottom. /li liObserve that the items down the bottom have an exclamation mark next to them. /li liRight click the Item and select Delete. /li /ol  <answer288254> I struggled with this, too. After following several dead ends (from Google searches, e.g., suggesting deleting photo caches, which had no effect on the warning messages for me), and not knowing of @hawkeye's useful information, I noticed that there was a small warning symbol (triangle with an exclamation mark in it) in iTunes, between my device's name and the device eject symbol, at the top of the device panel on the left. When I clicked on the warning symbol, a message popped up describing what the problem was; see the image. (In my case, I didn't have enough free space to replace a particularly large app.)  Apple sure could make this more obvious!  By the way, you can get an unsynced item warning on the device when there isn't a problem, due to stale data in iTunes. You can eliminate the device warning by resetting dialog warnings and the iTunes Store cache in the emAdvanced/em section of iTunes preferences; there are two buttons there you can push. This solved a mysterious sync warning problem for me in the past.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cU2gX.png" alt="iTunes sync warning info display"  <comment293451> Have you looked in the console.app (system logs) for iTunes errors messages? <comment293454> In the iTunes sidebar, I've clicked and seen a window come up like "Facebook and 10 other items could not be synced"; which is one detail more than what the phone showed, but not overly helpful. <comment293459> Do you have iOS applications in iTunes that are purchased with different account from your main account in your iOS device? <comment294587> Thanks @SteveChambers - nothing in the console.app. <comment294588> Hi @HamidRohani - no I don't believe I do - would that make a difference? <comment294596> @hawkeye Sorry, my mistake.. I have misunderstood your question. I have applications in my iTunes that are purchased with different accounts and while syncing the library with my iPhone, iTunes rises the error you mentioned on iPhone screen and also on iTunes. But what I observed in different versions of iTunes is: It always shows the error message and has `mode details` option that describe which applications could not be synced successfully. Sorry for my mistake ;)
