Transferring annotations made on a PDF in Preview to another PDF <body> I have many PDF's that I have annotated in Preview.app and want to transfer them to an updated version of the PDF. For the most part they should have the same number of pages in each PDF. I have an updated PDF version each month and need to be doing this quite often with many files   Whats the best method to do this?  cheers,  <comment279592> Possible duplicate of [Export pdf annotations only using preview?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70088/export-pdf-annotations-only-using-preview)
