Any advice on troubleshooting instability in Mountain Lion OS X 10.8.4? <body> In all cases of crashes, I can SSH to the machine, but I can't figure out anything useful to remedy the situation.  This freeze happened when sizing the crop in Aperture. Machine had been running for probably 3 days.  Apple support wants to me uninstall every system extension, etc. to troubleshoot. They can't seem to find anything in the logs. I find that hard to believe that this issue cannot be troubleshooted via ssh or the logs.  Needless to say, freezing every 3 days is awful. My guess is that the issue is related to updates related to Aperture or Chrome. I'm pretty sure I've been running Chrome every time the machine has crashed. I'm also sure the machine has sometimes crashed without Aperture running.  Any advice on how to troubleshoot?  In installed Tempurature Monitor download. Any advice on alert settings?  I'm going to try SMC Fan Control set to "Higher RPM".  Is there any way to have the dual video card only use the NVidia card rather than the Intel one (when using A/C)? Could that be relevant?

You could also post it here but there is going to be a lot to go through.   Probably best to ssh into the box just after the display crashes and run it then piping the output as such:  precodesyslog | tail -n 100 |open -ef /code/pre  <answer120589> You could try using this menu bar app http://gfx.io to force integrated only mode (provided you don't used an external display) and see if stability improves.  Sounds like you are using an iMac (or MacBook Pro)? I had a similar issue with graphics-instability in my 2009 Mac Pro. After I replaced the graphics card I realized the original one was chock-full of dust blocking basically all airflow to the GPU fan. I disassembled it and cleaned it out and it is now running fine (albeit with smcFanControl ramped up a bit, because it seems my chipset also runs hot or has a bad sensor).  What I'm trying to say here is: try to make sure you have good air-flow in addition to ramping up the fan speeds. Easiest is just to feel if there is flow, but if there is not, some disassembly may be required. The stability of my machine was improved drastically by those two measures, though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/miqAN.png" alt="enter image description here"  This thread speculated (similar due to the LO_WAT_ALERT error) about ram usage and free swap space, but ultimately solved it with a mobo replacement.   <comment123539> I think it is definitely something to do with your GPUs. Have you done a search on the Nvidia site for updated drivers?  The channel exception you are experiencing seems to be an ongoing issue with osx and Nvidia. <comment175576> @Deesbek, although I also think this is GPU related, I think its more a hardware problem than a software problem. <comment175577> On what hardware does this happen? I see JustinMbp in the logs. Are you running a MacBook Pro? What version? <comment175708> The number of crashes decreased with newer OS versions. Skype screen sharing will almost always crash my machine. I'm using a late 2012 MBP, retina, fully loaded with 2 external displays.
