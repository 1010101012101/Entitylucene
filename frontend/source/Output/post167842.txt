Using keyboard text shortcuts in word <body> I created some text "shortcuts" (well..not very short) in Keyboard. For example, when I type code\alpha/code I get codeα/code, and if I type code\sigma/code I get codeσ/code. While this works in almost everything on my computer, it doesn't work in Microsoft Office (e.g., Word and PowerPoint). I wonder if there is a way to make these shortcuts also work in MS Office. Thanks!  <answer167851> Unfortunately MS Office products live in the own world.  So to make the Alpha and Sigma words be replaced with Greek symbols you need to do following.  Open Word- Preference.  Now choose the Auto Correct  There is a field called Replace -With where you can now do that.  See this example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4l0Rv.jpg" alt="alpha sigma"  Use same process for PowerPoint.  <comment196847> I wonder whether Word for Mac has the same feature as Word for Windows: if you open the “Math AutoCorrect” tab, there is a checkbox for applying math autocorrection outside formulas, too (i.e. outside formulas constructed using Equation Tools). And math autocorrection has a large number of “corrections” *predefined*, e.g. `\alpha` produces α. <comment196848> @JukkaK.Korpela good point, care to make that a question!
