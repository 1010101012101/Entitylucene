Test a launcher app icon on an iPhone <body> I need to test a launcher app icon on an iPhone. Is there any way to do that without having to install an entire app?  <answer84238> You could create an HTML page for this which refers to the icon.   precode&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/custom_icon.png"/&gt; /code/pre  If you then open the web page and add the site to your home screen it will take codecustom_icon.png/code as your app icon.  For more detailed information have a look at Apple's developer page.  <answer90740> You can use tools for testing icon design such as http://www.ikonica.me, it's much quicker than creating an HTML file, especially if you have to test multiple designs at once.  <answer96158> You can also use http://testico.net. Nothing to download on your desktop, no app to install on your phone, free.  <comment96907> Great - thanks so much, cyphorious! That worked very well.
