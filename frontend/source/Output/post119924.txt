Autokey NTP client? <body> What's a reasonably short path to getting OS X to be an NTP client of an NTP server, using strongautokey/strong?  I tried adding the server's public keyfile (iffpar) and the appropriate commands in ntp.conf in the same way that works on a Linux client, but I'm not getting an authenticated connection from the OS X (10.8.5) client.

The last time I checked you need to rebuild OSX's ntp in order to get autokey working. <comment140170> Yes, **autokey**, thank you. Fixed. By "rebuild", do you mean replacing the OS X NTP with one built from some source repo? Is there an OS X-compatible source, somewhere? <comment140263> Yes rebuild means recompile the sources. http://www.ntp.org
