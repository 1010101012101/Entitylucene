Removal of phantom photos/videos? <body> In my general settings, it says that my iphone 6 contains 1996 photos and 111 videos when in reality..... I have 25 photos total and no videos. I recently wiped out my entire camera roll and recently deleted photos but it didn't help at all.  Anyone know any solutions to this issue? It takes up 5.1 GB and it has been affecting the functionality of my phone.   <comment214683> Did you do a hard reset after deleting everything? (hold Sleep + Home until the Apple logo appears) Is iCloud Photo Library or Photo Stream enabled? What appears when you go to Settings  General  Usage  (Storage) Manage Storage and tap on Photos & Camera?
