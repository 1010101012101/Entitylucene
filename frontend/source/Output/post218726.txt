Where's the best place to download Ubuntu virtual machines? <body> I'm using VirtualBox, and found a list of Ubuntu images here. But as of today it doesn't include an image for code14.04/code, which I need to install codeGitLab/code on, (or build from source).  What URLs would you suggest to ease the search for a client image of codeUbuntu 14.04/code?  <answer218733> The image file downloads for the latest version(s) of Ubuntu (including 14.04) are listed on Ubuntu's Release/Downloads page (searchable in Google).  Here's a guide on how to install the system from the ISO format, using VirtualBox (your tool of choice):  http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/07/how-to-set-up-ubuntu-linux-on-a-mac-its-easy-and-free/  For the VirtualBox image (instead of ISO), go here (lists versions from 14-15):  http://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/  As such, it goes without saying that you should use the original source whenever possible.  Good day to you!  <comment264451> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software within the scope defined in the [help centre](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic). <comment283087> Should this question be moved to the AskUbuntu website?
