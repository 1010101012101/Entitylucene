How do I silence my phone for ten minutes? <body> How do I temporarily enable do-not-disturb mode for 10 minutes?  If I turn on do not disturb, silent mode, or airplane mode then I tend to forget to turn it off. If so, I miss important work messages.  I use WeChat and suffer from flurries of activity. Somebody will start a chat room, pull you in, and then your phone will beep and shake constantly for about 10 minutes.  <answer275515> Schedule DND on WeChat or iPhone. Can also mute a specific group on WeChat.  Otherwise ask Siri to "turn on do not disturb" and "set a timer for 10 minutes".  <comment346583> Presently, I just turn on airplane mode. And then I forget to turn it off and I get in trouble.
