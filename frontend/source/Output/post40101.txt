If so, reading lists are also synced and maybe it's a problem with syncing. <comment45400> Good suggestion, but I did exactly both steps and it doesn't remove my bookmarks, cache etc. etc. I searched for a de-installation instruction but it seems that it isn't possible to remove safari completely from the system
