Initialize Time Machine backup without clicking the menu bar icon <body> Is there a way to start 'Backup now' without going to System Preferences, enabling Time Machine Menu bar and clicking it if I have the icon hidden?  Clicking on the drive doesn't let me backup:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/spEoW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer196048> codetmutil/code is a command line utility for "controlling and interacting with Time Machine." Try codeman tmutil/code. (I'm on OS X 10.10.4).  You can also control/right click on a Time Machine drive in a Finder window or sidebar. If a backup is running you can stop it, if not you can "Back Up Now."  <comment234096> Thanks mtklr it was `tmutil startbackup`
