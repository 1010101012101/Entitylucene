Can't install Homebrew on Mac OS X Lion <body> I followed the simple instructions on Homebrew's homepage:  precodePaste this at a terminal prompt: /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)" /code/pre  But I get the following permission errors.  What is the proper way to install Homebrew on Mac OS X Lion?  precode$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)" ==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/Formula/... /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/...  Press enter to continue ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod o+w /usr/local mkdir: /usr/local/Cellar: Permission denied mkdir: /usr/local/etc: Permission denied mkdir: /usr/local/include: Permission denied mkdir: /usr/local/lib: Permission denied mkdir: /usr/local/Library: Permission denied mkdir: /usr/local/sbin: Permission denied mkdir: /usr/local/share: Permission denied mkdir: /usr/local/var: Permission denied mkdir: /usr/local/.git: Permission denied Failed during: /bin/mkdir /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/etc /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/Library /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share /usr/local/var /usr/local/.git $ /code/pre  <answer20025> Try this: codesudo /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"/code.  <answer25767> I just struggled with the same problem, but instead of manually entering any commandssup†/sup, I used stronggist: 768518/strong to do the dirty stuff for me. Worked like a charm—and you won't need any codesudo/codeing!  The aforementioned gist (aptly described as "Fix permissions on /usr/local for Homebrew") only emfixes/em the permissions, i.e. it doesn't install Homebrew despite the fact it is a fork of the installation script.  hr  sup†) other than the required code$ chmod a+x fix_homebrew.rb/code and code$ ./fix_homebrew.rb/code of course/sup  <answer25770> Github has a beautiful app for Mac that eliminates the painful commandline process (if the commandline is not your thing that is ;-))  <answer114438> try these, these works for me..  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)" /code/pre  <answer114439> the official oneliner from brew.sh is this...  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"  why would you like to use a outdated gist version and not the original script???  <comment22111> I think that would've worked, I was reluctant to because I didn't want to mess with Homebrew's mechanism for enabling non-sudo required installs.  The problem seemed to be that Homebrew added o+w permission to `/usr/local`, but OS X Lion's main user is part of the group of `/usr/local`, so adding g+w worked.  I assume I can now safely remove with `sudo chmod g-w /usr/local`? <comment22112> I have to admit I just posted a knee-jerk "Permission issue, try sudo" answer. I don't actually __know__ the answer, but I presume you could indeed try that :) <comment29301> It would be rather contradictory, though, if one wishes to install Homebrew while command-line not being his "thing" :-D <comment115597> How would GitHub for Mac help with installing Homebrew? <comment134109> mxcl/homebrew repo is now homebrew/homebrew
