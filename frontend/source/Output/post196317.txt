How to get the AppStore back on my iPad <body> How do I get back my AppStore back on my mini iPad. Seems to have disappeared. Kindly help. I cannot see the icon and I can't find out how to install it back.   <answer196319> You can't delete the AppStore App. I must have moved on another page or in a folder.   You can access it by searching from the spotlight search bar ! (slip down from the springboard)   <comment234474> Have you tried using Spotlight search to see if it recognizes the app?
