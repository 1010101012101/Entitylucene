Thanks in advance â€“   <answer257670> Assuming you can see the contents on the file system, the backups are located at code/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup//code in relation to the root of the drive.  Heads up that the codeLibrary/code folder located in your user's directory is hidden. You can use shortcut kbdShift/kbd + kbdCommand/kbd + kbdG/kbd in Finder to bring up the 'Go To' dialog so you can copy + paste that location to get to the file. Just be aware that if you're mounting the drive, you will need to append code/Volumes/DriveNameHere/code to the beginning of the path.  <comment326877> Hi, and thanks for the repay I was able to follow the steps provided but now it's telling me the folder "Library" can't be opened because you don't have permission to see its contents.
