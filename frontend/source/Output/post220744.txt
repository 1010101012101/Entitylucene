Cannot erase SD card with Disk Utility (El Capitan) <body> I have this SD card that I am trying to use to backup photos on a Windows computer.  After using the SD card on the Windows computer, and copying the photos back on a safe drive, I cannot erase the SD card:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JsMK0.png" alt="enter image description here"  And yep, in the Info window for the card, the device is listed as "read only":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wt3aw.png" alt="enter image description here"  I checked the Lock Tab and it's not on Lock position... What gives?  <answer221952> For a reason I haven't yet understood, the card was erased just fine once I used an older version of emDisk Utility/em.  When I inserted the SD Card in a computer running Yosemite, two drives mounted, one called "NO NAME" which I could click on, and one called "UNTITLED" which seemed to be a ghost file or an alias:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcTPb.png" alt="enter image description here"  When using emVersion 13 (606)/em of emDisk Utility/em (so, the version included with Yosemite), the SD Card was erased without any problem.  The ghost "UNTITLED" drive disappeared.   I am therefore led to believe that the new emDisk Utility/em in emEl Capitan/em doesn't work the same way as the previous one, or that it failed at erasing the card in this particular situation.  <answer267714> I had the same exact problem.  Format your card using this application: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html  Worked perfect for me.  Cheers.  <comment267218> Try executing: `sudo chown username /dev/disk1`, with username being your username. You might also try `sudo chmod 750 /dev/disk1`. These commands set the permissions, as permissions error might be the case, since the Info tab says you can only read <comment267219> Thanks! Tried, no luck. Terminal also doesn't seem to recognize my username...?  `MacBook-Pro:~ fabrice$ sudo chmod 750 /dev/disk1 Password: MacBook-Pro:~ fabrice$ sudo chown fabrice /dev/disk1 -bash: fabrice: No such file or directory MacBook-Pro:~ fabrice$ sudo chown Fabrice /dev/disk1 -bash: Fabrice: No such file or directory MacBook-Pro:~ fabrice$ whoami fabrice MacBook-Pro:~ fabrice$ sudo chdown fabrice$ /dev/disk1 -bash: fabrice$: No such file or directory MacBook-Pro:~ fabrice$` <comment267220> It does not recognize because you put the  and  signs in. If I were to username I'd do `John` not `John`. So `sudo chown fabrice /dev/disk1` <comment267221> Oh! Ok, gotcha - sorry. I tried both command lines and neither did work - still can't erase in Disk Utility and SD card still read only in the Info Window <comment267222> Since it is not the lock issue, try first `diskutil unmountDisk /Volumes/UNTITLED` and then try erasing the partition. Sometimes, you can also select the hardware **APPLE SD CARD READER**, going to partitions, and selecting from current, to 1 partition, formatting and applying. Should delete, and re-add a partition <comment267223> `Unmount failed for /Volumes/UNTITLED`and when I select APPLE SD CARD READER the Partition option is greyed out <comment267225> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/33396/discussion-between-thebro21-and-fabrice-d). <comment335981> SDFormatter, that's the ticket!
