Flash Drive Not Detected in Macbook Pro (Mountain Lion) <body> In my Macbook pro flash drive is not detected.  But When I attach my iphone it is detected without problem.  I also check in Disk Utility, but It is not shown. if I attached the same pen drive on Another Machine it is detected without problem.  Can anyone tell what may be the issue?  I am using HP v112b Media Pendrive 16 GB (MS-Dos FAT32 Format)  <comment121447> Missing information: What type of flash drive?, What other machine? Do all the USB ports have the same problem on MBP?
