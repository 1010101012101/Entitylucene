iMessage notifications won't wake iPhone <body> Since the iOS 10 update (same with 10.2), my iPhone's screen doesn't turn on to show iMessage notifications. They are there when I manually hit the power or home button to turn the screen on, though. Do you have any idea what this could be? Do Not Disturb is turned off. I tried turning iMessage notifications off, restarting the phone and turning everything on again. That didn't help. This doesn't apply to other kind of notifications, as they turn the screen on. How can I get iMessage notifications to wake the screen again?
