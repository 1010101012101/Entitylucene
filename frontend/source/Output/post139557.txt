How should I reconcile dot-underscore files after a manual backup? <body> I recently had to (hurriedly) back up data on an older Macbook before migrating it to a new one. Since all I had at my disposal was a large FAT32 formatted drive, I used that and a manual copy. I've since used codersync/code to put it back on a (non-journaled) HFS+ drive (under Ubuntu).  Now most of the files have a corresponding code._/code file alongside them. I understand that this is how OS X stores extended attributes and other information on non-HFS+ filesystems. So my question is: now that I have these files back on a HFS+ filesystem, how can I reconcile the information in the code._/code files? That is, since the data in those files can now be stored in the HFS+ metadata for each file, how do I put it back?  <answer139566> You can copy the files using Finder. It seems Finder can reconcile these when copying from a partition type that doesn't support extended metadata to a partition type that does, reversing it's procedure for doing the reverse and creating the dotfiles.  <answer139627> h2dot_clean/h2  dot_clean(1) Mac OS X Manual Page  Apple's description:      codeFor each dir, dot_clean recursively merges all ._* files with their   corresponding native files according to the rules specified with the   given arguments.

Whilst the man page lists no known bugs, it is possible to lose data through careless use of the command.    <comment164522> Seems reasonable. I'll try it out soon. <comment164596> I've always thought dot_clean simply cleaned the dotfiles rather than merging them; this is the way to go, +1 <comment164597> "…  from a partition type that doesn't support extended metadata …"; the ._ files are already on HFS Plus. <comment164598> @Graham Yes, but copied with rsync which doesn't merge the dotfiles. I meant copying them from the original FAT32 partition to the HFS+ with Finder. <comment164600> Not only Finder. Utilities such as [ditto(1)](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ditto.1.html) will preserve resource forks, HFS metadata, extended attributes and ACLs. <comment164602> When I last checked, long ago, there was no file system capability check. So, for example, applying a `dot_clean` command to any part of an MS-DOS FAT32 volume would silently lose (be unable to merge) the content of `._` files in that part of the volume.
