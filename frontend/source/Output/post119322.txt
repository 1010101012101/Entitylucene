Navigate on pop up windows <body> When I was using Windows I could navigate with tab to pop up windows for choosing 'Yes' or 'No' faster. Now on OS X  I haven't found a way. In some cases I can choose the first letter and it will be accepted. But in examples like in the picture below, there's no such a thing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVOL8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer119329> Go to the strongSystem preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong.  Then you can enable strongFull Keyboard Access/strong to strongAll Controls/strong !   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C1aZC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer119345> ..or you can press codeControl + F7/code to enable this feature in a wink!
