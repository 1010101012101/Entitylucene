Can OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard be installed on a 2007 MacBook Intel Core 2 Duo, 1GB <body> Ok so i have a 2007 MacBook2,1 - 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo - OS X 10.5.8 - Memory 1GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM.  I can't currently sync my iphone 4s (IOS 7.1.1) or ipad (IOS 8.2) because i can't upgrade to itunes 11 which i need IOS 10.6.8.  with my macbook can i upgrade to snow leopard 10.6 then to 10.6.8 ??  thanks  <answer187498> According to Everymac the Macbook 2,1 can be updated as far as Lion 10.7.5, so yes, you should be fine on 10.6.8  <answer187697> I am running SNL 10.6.8 on a similar 2007 MBP, a little faster than yours (2.6 GHZ).  Original OS was Tiger.  I had initially upgraded to Lion but found it wouldn't run Final Cut Express 4.0 reliably.  Good luck!
