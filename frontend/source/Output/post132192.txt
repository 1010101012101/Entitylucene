Assign an agent app to all desktops <body> I am running an app (Simple Floating Clock) that runs as an agent (LSUIElement assigned to 1 in the app's Info.plist).  I would like to assign the app to "All Desktops" that I run.  Normally, if an app is not an agent, I can right click on the dock icon, select options, and then click "All Desktops".    Is there a simple way to set the all desktops behavior, maybe using the command line or something?  <answer132198> Assign the app to All Desktops, emthen/em set LSUIElement to 1. It should remember the change and abide by it even though it now runs as an agent.  <comment155378> I did just notice that the app I mentioned has a menu bar icon, so it does provide an option for the functionality that I am looking for.  However, I think that the question is still a valid one.
