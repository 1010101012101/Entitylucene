Moving Files and Photos iPhone5s to/from older non-apple devices <body> I have an iPhone 5s, an old laptop running Windows XP a Tesco Hudl, and a Samsung Galaxy 3.  How can i easily move files and photos to and from the iPhone without using my limited data allowance?    The only version of iTunes I found to download will not run on Windows XP. The iPhone Bluetooth will not talk to the Samsung Bluetooth or the Hudl.   Is there a way of doing it using the Wi-Fi bearing in mind I rarely have access to a separate Wi-Fi network/router?  The phone signal is usually very poor. The USB stick that works in the Hudl, the Samsung and the laptop will not work in the iPhone even with an adaptor. I have taken to calling it the idiot phone.   <answer250264> You can get photos strongemfrom/em/strong the phone using Windows Photo Gallery - assuming you can still find a version that will run on XP.br strongemTo/em/strong the phone will require you to find an equally ageing  iTunes.   Your problem really isn't the iPhone, it's still being on a version of Windows that hasn't been supported in years.  <comment310655> I don't know much about the Galaxy 3 or the Hudl, but couldn't you use an cloud storage service like Dropbox or OneDrive to centralize all your data then pull it down using the same client for iOS (iPhone)? <comment310667> That would kind of blow the "limited data allowance" part;-)
