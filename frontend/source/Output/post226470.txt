OpenSSL 0.9.8zg used by PHP does not support TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.1 <body> A week ago, as part of the installation a PHP 5.4 cartridge from openshift.com on my Mac with OS X 10.10.5 in the Terminal I noticed a message about it loading OpenSSL 0.9.8 for compatibilty with PHP.  Today, when I tried to install getcomposer.org it is giving me a warning:     Some settings on your machine may cause stability issues with Composer.br   If you encounter issues, try to change the following:      The OpenSSL library (0.9.8zc) used by PHP does not support TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.1.  If possible you should upgrade OpenSSL to version 1.0.1 or above.   codeopenssl version/code command in terminal reported codeOpenSSL 0.9.8zg/code 14 July 2015  Is 0.9.8zc or 0.9.8zg safe?  How many OpenSSL versions do OS X hold?  Should I update to latest OpenSSL version?  <comment275000> From OpenSSL website: `The 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 versions are now out of support and should not be used.` <comment275001> Define "safe"? If you are asking if there are known vulnerabilities, that's an easy thing to check. As for the rest of your questions, that's a really Mac-specific question and perhaps better suited for SuperUser or AskDifferent? <comment297123> Also see [Warning: openssl-1.0.2g already installed when using HomeBrew](http://stackoverflow.com/q/36372000) and [How to upgrade OpenSSL version used by PHP](http://stackoverflow.com/q/37649413) on Stack Overflow.
