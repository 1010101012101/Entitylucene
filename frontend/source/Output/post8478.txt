What's a good XML viewer/editor for Mac OS X? <body> I use XML Editor from XMLmind for editing/viewing XML file in Mac.  It's not bad, but I expect an XML editor for Mac. What options do I have including the commercial/free software?  <answer8480> If you have the Apple Developer Tools installed, then you have XCode and this includes the codeProperty List Editor/code app (Apple preference plist files are often in XML format, hence the app name).  You can find the app here: code/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Property List Editor.app/code  <answer8488> h2OS X Software for Editing XML/h2  ul liEditX (commercial)/li lioXygen (commercial)/li liXML Edita (commercial)/li liXMLMate (free/open source plugin) for TextMate (shareware)/li liXMPlify (commercial)/li /ul  <answer8506> Although it's still a beta I have found Xmplify to be a pretty useful XML aware tool. Copes with DTD, XSD, XPath and XSL transformation in the tool  <answer8573> Eclipse works on Mac OS and it is one of the best XML editor around, actually. It has XSD validation, autocompletion towards this schema. Also, it offers a graphical XSD designer.  <answer22944> I'm looking for the same thing, and I just came across XMLmind XML Editor. I like how it can load my files pretty quickly.  @rds: I've tried using Eclipse to open my XML files, but it would hang with my files (15MB).  I've come to notice any editor built with Java hangs upon trying to open my file, or at least takes an unbearably long time to load it.  <answer65321> Testing this and that, I settled down with Text Wrangler, with XML Tidy script. It's free and pretty useful for my purposes.   <answer65328> TextMate.  You can download the source code from GitHub and compile it locally. Then in the preferences install the appropriate emlanguage bundle/em. https://github.com/textmate/textmate  If you like the application I would recommend buying the commercial version to show your support to the author.  <answer158596> You can try all in one JSON viewer or all in one XML viewer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7izfH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer198203> IntelliJ IDEA is overall a good IDE, it's available on Mac, and it supports editing XML in ways such as syntax highlighting, collapsing a given scope, and validating XML. I haven't used it much for XML, but I've had good experiences with that IDE for other purposes so thought I would mention it here.  <answer235678> I like the look of http://www.sublimetext.com/2 as seen in a Daniel Shiffman tutorial  <answer249070> And of course Emacs with psgml-mode or nxml-mode will edit XML.  <answer271858> As an alternative to XMLmind XML Editor there's QXmlEdit It is also free and quite feature rich. It's written in Qt and runs on Mac as well as the other platforms Qt supports.  <comment9093> Are you just editing XML specific to the Mac (like 'plist' and 'sdef') or are you editing a variety of schemas? <comment9098> @Philip : I wanted a general solution to parse the XML files. <comment9145> I don't think the Property List Editor can deal with generic XML files, it's intended to edit a specific .plist format. <comment63027> Of the many mentioned here, which is your recommendation? Which is better featured? Which is more Mac-like in behaviour? <comment76735> Obligatory: [vim](http://www.vim.org/) is good enough for me! <comment83114> The OP already mentioned XMLmind. <comment105780> Out of beta now, $59. <comment106674> ^ This is true (what ghoppe said). And even now that it's integrated into Xcode, no longer standalone, you just get the raw color coded code with line numbers. No disclosure triangles, etc. like a _.plist_ file gives you. <comment153058> Also, XMLmind is Java, so shouldn't it hang as well, @jde? <comment272009> Well, Xcode complaint on an XML not being in the right format. So... it's not exactly generic. <comment272010> Please repair the link to [EditX](http://www.editix.com/download.html) that now is not free. Linked is an old version for PowerPC <comment292480> XML Tidy does indentation ... and I believe it checks well-formedness. Apparently xmllint, which the XML Tidy script uses, *can* validate. Can you validate XML using XML Tidy within Text Wrangler? <comment308822> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.

Worth every dollar. <comment351123> Just to add: `Ctrl/âŒ˜` + `Shift` + `F` will format the XML.
