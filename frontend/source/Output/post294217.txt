Downloading all books from iCloud onto iOS device <body> I have a fairly large collection of books stored in iCloud (hundreds). After a hard reset of my iPad, I would like to transfer them all back onto my device for offline use. Is there some "download all books locally" button somewhere, or am I stuck with having to individually press the cloud icon next to each and every single one? Syncing with the "All books" option iTunes only does so much, still leaving a large number of books on iCloud.
