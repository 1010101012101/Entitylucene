createinstallmedia: cannot execute binary file <body> I have downloaded the Sierra Installer from the App Store and I would like to make a bootable thumbdrive out of it.  I tried using the codecreateinstallmedia/code binary that the installer ships with but got the following error:  precode/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia: cannot execute binary file /code/pre  What happened? How do I go about fixing it?  <answer288130> Redownloaded the installer. And everything works fine.  p.s. I'm in China at the moment. Look like package loss is a real problem here.   <comment363793> Can you  correct your post so we can see the whole command that you have given? Further you need root privileges - try it with sudo. <comment363795> @dante12 I got the error by just running it i.e. `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia`
