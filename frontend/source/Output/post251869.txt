Will the new iPhone 7 be compatible with other wireless headphones? <body> It was not clearly explained, whether new iPhone 7 will be only compatible with affiliated brands rather than free to connect with any wireless headset.   <answer251871> Since this was just announced and the technical details haven't been posted, I'm only about 99% sure about this but I would say yes.    I'm pretty sure Apple will follow the established Bluetooth protocol so any headphones or speakers out now should work fine with the 7.   <answer251881> In a word, yes.  The iPhone 7 &amp; 7 Plus both use Bluetooth 4.2 technology.  Considering the vast majority of wireless headphones use bluetooth, this means the iPhone 7 &amp; 7 Plus will be able to pair with them just as previous iPhone models have in the past.  From Apple's iPhone 7 / 7 Plus technical specifications page, under the Cellular &amp; Wireless section:     802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wiâ€‘Fi with MIMO      Bluetooth 4.2 wireless technology       NFC   <comment313228> If you're going to down vote the answer then have the courage to post why and then add your own answer.
