Installing Bootcamp on External HD without using all available storage <body> I recently used Siphonx's UEFI method of installing bootcamp on my seagate 1TB external HD. The windows installation only took 16gb. When booted into MacOS and opened the hard drive though I wasn't able to transfer files onto the drive itself.   Is there a way to partition the drive such that I have essentially three partitions? 1 - ntfs, 2 - fat32, 3 - macosx If so, at what point in the process would I be able to do so?  <comment363949> Please add a link to *Siphonx's UEFI method of installing bootcamp* in your question because googling for it doesn't reveal anything...
