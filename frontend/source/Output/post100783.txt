Website loads fine in Chrome, but won't load at all in Safari <body> I have a local web server running a basic web site.  The problem I'm having is that the page loads fine in Chrome, however in Safari it wont load at all.  I've tried routing all my traffic through a proxy server and when I load the page in Chrome I see the expected result in the proxy logs, but from Safari there isn't a single entry in the logs, so it appears that Safari is not even attempting to load the page.  I've also tried the following to clear up any potential networking issues:  ol liTurning off the iPhone, and then back on again/li liSetting the phone to Airplane mode, and then back on again/li liReset network settings through the Settings app/li liRemoving all cookies/data/history from the Safari settings page/li /ol  None of the above have resolved the issue.  I'm doing this on an iPhone, latest versions of iOS (and therefore mobile Safari) and the latest Chrome app.  <comment118634> And you have checked your Safari settings? <comment118635> There has been reports that a DNS setting could affect Safari. <comment118664> The Safari settings don't mention anything about DNS.  I've tried clearing all website data as well, with no impact. <comment118673> DNS settings on your router, not in Safari.
