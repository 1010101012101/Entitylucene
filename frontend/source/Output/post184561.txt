iOS app for simultaneous reading and listening to a (audio) book <body> strongI'd like to read books in a foreign language while listening to its Audiobook version. Is there an app that can do that?/strong  Notes:  ul liThis is what Amazon calls strongImmersive Reading/strong. It's available on their Kindle Fire tablets./li liA plus would be if I could tap a word to see its translation./li liIt does not so much matter what books are available. I'm happy as long as there are some Public Domain books./li /ul  <answer184572> If I got that correctly I think Audible Whispersync (an Amazon product) does that.  <comment218828> (Shame on you if it is because it's the 2nd result when google'ing "immersive reading kindle" ;-) .) <comment218887> Seems you're right. I knew about Amazon Immersive Reading (and Whispersync), but I read somewhere that they don't offer it on iOS devices. Gonna give it a try.
