Is there a way to create a polar plot in Numbers? <body> I am trying to do a strongpolar plot/strong, or radar chart as excel calls them, for a report. I don't have excel, only strongNumbers/strong, is there a way to do that type of plot with strongNumbers/strong? I can't seem to find a way. The closest thing to a polar plot that I was able to create was a point cluster with the data transformed from polar to cartesian coordinates, but this doesn't center the axis at 0,0.  <answer290435> An app called Radars on the Apple App Store generates polar plots for you to import to your Numbers documents. That's what it says in the description, I however have not tried it yet.
