How do I change the direction of a speech bubble in Preview? <body> I'm using Preview to add some speech bubbles to a picture.  The default speech bubble assumes the speaker is below and to the left.  Can I change where the speech is coming from?  <answer147799> Yes!  You can drag the text bubble bounding box (the blue dots that you would use to resize the bubble) over to the other side.  This effectively over-"resizes" the bubble so it is mirrored.  <answer147801> You can simply drag the corner selection (the round dot) to the other side  Like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GtKGE.jpg" alt="speech bubble"  <answer147805> Just drag the cursor starting from the direction where you want the point to be.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLjzj.gif" alt=""
