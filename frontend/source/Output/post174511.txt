Block µTorrent ads <body> Recently, I upgraded to µTorrent 1.8.7 and found that it has annoying ad in the side bar which was not present in the earlier version. Can someone explain that how can I stop the ads?  <answer174513> one option is to just hide the sidebar  ViewHide Sidebar  <answer177208> The solution for the ad removal is to remove the new uTorrent and install the older version of the app. You can get it from the site below.  uTorrent 1.8.4  <answer211666> As per this post: https://pietrodn.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/how-to-block-advertisements-on-utorrent-1-8-6-for-mac-os-x-using-the-hosts-file/     Luckily, we can simply block the uTorrent ad servers at system-level,   editing the hosts file. Using the free network analyzer Wireshark I   easily discovered which servers uTorrent connects to, to fetch the   ads.      To block those ads, first quit uTorrent. Then open the code/etc/hosts/code file   with your favorite text-editor (you’ll need root privileges) and   append the following lines:  precode127.0.0.1 cdn.bitmedianetwork.com 127.0.0.1 static.ap.bittorrent.com /code/pre      Next, trash the code~/Library/Caches/com.bittorrent.uTorrent/code folder in   order to get rid of any cached ads. Now restart uTorrent, et voila:   the ads are gone!   <comment205478> I am doing that currently. But is there any way to fully block it ? <comment205480> Not that I know of, sorry! <comment255566> Or switch to Transmission, or other client. <comment280567> After trying countless other websites which said to set advanced settings, swap the ad picture, or download other host files -- none of those schemes worked. You had the correct answer. Thank you sincerely.
