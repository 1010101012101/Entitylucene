Apple TestFlight iOS 8 - What is the limit for external beta testers? <body> I have an iOS developer account and I would like to test 2 apps with the new Apple TestFlight service. Is the 1000 limit for external testers per app or per developer account?  <answer166896> developers can invite 1,000 testers per application, with different testers for separate apps. Up to 10 apps can be tested at a time, internally or externally.  <answer215642> As of November 13. 2015. there are some changes occurred in iTunesConnect:     To make your TestFlight experience even better, weâ€™ve made some   significant changes. You can now invite up to 2000 external testers   and up to 25 internal testers per app. You can also test up to 100   apps at the same time for up to 60 days, and submit up to 6 updates   per day to your external testers.   So, right now we can invite 2000 external testers per app.
