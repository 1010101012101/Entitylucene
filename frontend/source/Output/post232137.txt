How to reauthorise a Google account in Internet Accounts (after changing Google Account password) on Mac OS 10.11 <body> My Google Account is connected to Mac OS X using Internet Accounts. I changed the password of my Google Account (at google.com) and now the OS - and especially Mac Mail - can no longer access the account.  I believe that Mac OS X is using OAuth to authorise with Google, so is it possible to force the OS to reauthorise the connected account (without deleting and starting again)?  Mac OS Version: 10.11.3  <answer232149> Have you tried opening System Preferences  Internet Accounts? Opening it will usually ask you to reauthorize when you've changed passwords. If not you can try checking and unchecking Notes.  <comment283606> Yes, and that hasn't worked, unfortunately.
