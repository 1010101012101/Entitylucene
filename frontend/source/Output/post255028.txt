macOS Sierra Mail.app "Load Remote Content" button doesn't work reliably <body> I have pushed the button and the content has loaded, sometimes it does nothing, other times it appears to do nothing, but if I push it a second time the content flashes up for a second before disappearing.   I'm guessing this is a bug, but wanted to see if anyone knew of a work-around.   I will often just look for a "load this message in a browser" link.
