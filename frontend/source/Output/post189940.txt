Final Cut X: how to find project <body> A friend of mine has worked on a FCP project on my Mac and I would like to retrieve the project file to continue editing. In the meantime I upgraded OS and FCP and these old projects are not anymore in sync, I cannot find the files and don't know where FCP usually stores these files in the hard disk.  Where should I look for? I searched the web and FCP online help for informations without success... Thanks.  <comment225387> Additional question: is there a "default" location for FCP project library ? <comment225397> If you open FCP you should be able to right click the library and tell it to reveal it's location in finder.
