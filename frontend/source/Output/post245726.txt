Certificate fingerprint in iOS <body> When I connect to a particular Wi-Fi network, it asks me to accept a certificate. I can check the certificate details, such as signatures and so on, but not the fingerprint. I'm fairly certain the certificate is correct so I accepted it.  Where can I find, in iOS, the certificates in use (such as this one I just accepted) and how can I see their fingerprints?  <comment302972> You can find profiles / certificates under Settings  General  Profile and tap on the profile for more information. I'm not familiar with 'fingerprint'. <comment302994> @rwzdoorn: I don't have an entry named *Profile* in Settings  General. Could it be under a different name? (The fingerprint is a hash of the complete certificate, useful to verify it is the correct one.)
