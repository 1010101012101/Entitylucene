iOS8 - Open podcasts app via website link? <body> One of my clients publishes a number of podcasts.  He would like to add links in our HTML site that would open the Podcast App and load or prompt to load the episode indicated in the link.  Is that possible?  <answer156636> Links to the podcast on the iTunes Store will direct iOS users to the Podcasts app automatically.  <comment184439> But AFAYK I can't use a link to get an episode to load (or a prompt to load episode)?
