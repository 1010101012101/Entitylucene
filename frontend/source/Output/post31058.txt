iPad app for reading and writing guitar tablature <body> I'm looking for an iPad app for guitar tabs reading and writing. I'd prefer that one had an auto scroll feature.  <answer31063> For reading tabs, I like Songsterr Plus, have heard good things about TabToolkit too. For writing tabs, Progression and Guitar Script supposedly both quite good, haven't tried either of them myself, though.  <comment35658> Links are awesome. <comment35736> Please add some links to your answer. <comment35781> Sorry, links seemed a bit superfluous when there's only one place you can buy iPad apps anyway. Fixed now.
