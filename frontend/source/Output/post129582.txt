Icons stuck on Desktop <body> For some reason I drag any of the icons on my Desktop. They are stuck. This is happening not only on my desktop, but also in all my other folders. I've checked "Show View Options" and set the order to "none." I've also set "Sort by" to none. I've checked the privileges on my Desktop and everything seems to look normal (I can read and write my desktop.)

Test the behavior on it and see if still occurs. Additionally, by "stuck" do you mean they "snap to grid" or they are literally stuck wherever you drag and drop them? <comment154105> How did you do that without knowing the firmware password? <comment154871> I just turned my computer on and then off... I wasn't able to boot into Recovery HD or run "resetpassword" or "Reset Home Directory... ACLs." I just turned it off and then on again. <comment154872> they were literally stuck. Don't move at all.
