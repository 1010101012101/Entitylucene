How do I stop my Mac from syncing my whole library to my iPhone? <body> Every time I plug my phone into my Mac, iTunes tries to synch hundreds of songs to my phone. If I just let it, it uses up all the available storage. I can't seem to find any menu option anywhere to stop the auto synch or to reverse the direction.  <answer268727> This is fairly straightforward to disable. Follow these steps:  ul liLaunch iTunes/li liGo to iTunes  Preferences/li liSelect the emDevices/em tab/li liAt the bottom, uncheck the emPrevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically/em/li liExit Preferences/li /ul  Let us know if this doesn't resolve your issue.  <answer268767> Once you've disabled the auto-sync as per Monomeeth's answer, you can then choose which songs it will transfer in future, at manual sync.  ul liConnect your phone.  /li liLaunch iTunes.  /li liWait for the phone icon to become solid, then click it.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MeQSz.png" alt="enter image description here"  /li liSelect Music on the left sidebar  /li liSelect something other than Entire Music Library You can then choose which songs/playlists etc it should sync from lower down the page [not shown on photo as I have 'all' selected.]/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IEzaA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment338780> My iTunes also has an "Automatically fill free space with songs" option, which presumably adjusts how many songs to add to the device based on the amount of free space available. You can also tweak this more finely: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/5900/5767
