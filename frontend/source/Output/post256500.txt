How can I stop iTunes overwriting my album artwork <body> I have a large collection of classical CDs which I am loading into iTunes. I prefer to use the same artwork as the CD but whenever I add my preferred graphic, within seconds it is overwritten by different artwork for the same album. I subscribe to both Apple match and Apple Music. Yosemite 10.10.5/iTunes 12.5.1.21. "Automatically download album artwork" is unchecked in Prefs/Store. Am I missing something?
