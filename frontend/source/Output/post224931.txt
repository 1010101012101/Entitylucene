Checking if a driver is loaded for a device <body> I'm trying to get a Hauppauge Nova-T USB dongle working under OS X El Capitan. I found an unofficial driver installer and a program to watch television using this dongle, but the program is not detecting it.  In Windows, I know I can go to Device Manager to check if a driver has been loaded for a certain device. How can I verify if a driver was loaded? I've already verified that the dongle was detected using codeioreg -p IOUSB/code:  precode+-o Nova-T Stick@14100000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x10001c71e, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (12 ms), retain 11&gt; /code/pre  <answer261687> List all loaded drivers:  precodesudo kextstat /code/pre  You may also use it with grep like codesudo kextstat |grep defyne/code
