Does safari on iOS update automatically? Outside of iOS updates? <body> I realize that safari is updated when iOS is updated. But is it ever updated silently, like chrome or firefox, for more minor additions? Say for bugs in webkit/nitro.  Or is it more like the stock android browser, or internet explorer? Which only are updated when the platforms they reside on are updated.  <answer92076> Safari is only updated with iOS updates. As far as I know, there is no background updating, and updates only happen along with iOS updates.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qfXfp.png" alt="Safari updates for iOS 6"  Above is a screenshot from the new features of iOS 6 - listed is Safari as one of those updates.  <comment108074> I realize that safari is updated when iOS is updated.
