Hide sheets in Numbers? <body> Is there any way to hide sheets in Numbers? (like in Excel) I have tried everything other than delete, since I may need to refer back to them.  <answer254800> Within codeNumbers/code there isn't such a function since you can only see one sheet at a time:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SriwD.png" alt="Numbers 2 sheets"   All the other sheets than the one displayed are hidden. The function to switch from one sheet to another one is provided by clicking on the wanted one whithin the sheets column.  <comment317272> I believe you misunderstood the question. In Excel, selecting Format  Sheet gives the option to hide and subsequently unhide any sheet, which causes its tab to disappear - the sheet is still present, but there's nothing on-screen indicating that. OP appears to want a function akin to that, to hide the sheet from appearing in the Sheets selector in Numbers.
