Shared folder with same name <body> On our network we have 2 network drives both with a folder named 'Shared', code//driveA/Shared/code and code//driveB/Shared/code. When someone connects to code//driveA/Shared/code, then connects to code//driveB/Shared/code, the code//driveB/Shared/code folder overwrites the code//driveA/Shared/code folder, because they are both named Shared. Even though it looks like both are connected, it can not find files from code//driveA/Shared/code. So people can not have both folders open at the same time. I tried manually mounting them with:  precodemount -t smbfs //drive1/Shared ~/drive1 mount -t smbfs //drive2/Shared ~/drive2 /code/pre  However, the problem still persist. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <answer95087> I would suggest that you change the domain names to simplify the problem,  say if they are in different room, use... R22shared and R23shared, or Serv1 shared / Serv2shared, this may get rid of you problem.
