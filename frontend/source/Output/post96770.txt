How to download folder structure to iPad for offline use? <body> I have a large number of files organised in nested directories on my computer and would like to have these available on iPad without constant internet access. The directories contain text files and PDF files. I would like to be able to read all of the files and also to modify text files and possibly add new ones.  My current solution consists of Dropbox and PlainText. Dropbox, however, seems to be unable to download directories: Can the iOS Dropbox app download all contents of all folders to my iPad?  I would prefer a free way of accomplishing this. Do any exist?
