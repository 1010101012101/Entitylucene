Emacs on Mac OS X - To Alt or Command? <body> It's official. I love to hate Emacs on Mac OS X.  No matter what I do, I get a thorn in side.   When I try to write code\/code using kbdAlt/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd7/kbd I get errors because kbdAlt/kbd == Meta in Emacs. If I bind the codeMeta/code to the kbdCommand/kbd key I circumvent that error. All is fine. Till I want to use codeMeta-/codekbdTab/kbd. Now I'm suddenly trying to kbdCommand/kbd-kbdTab/kbd away from Emacs into some other application.   I'm furious at the moment, could anyone help me solve this problem? I would prefer it if I could have kbdAlt/kbd as codemeta/code, not install aquamacs.org and not use the kbdfn/kbd key.  emOh, by the way, I use Swedish locale./em  strongEDIT 1:/strong  First solution: add code(global-set-key [C-tab] [M-tab])/code to code~/.emacs/code. This will tie the codeMeta-tab/codeto codeControl-tab/code instead. Not what I entirely wanted, but should work.  <answer12091> Some people I know always buy Macs with US keyboards for exactly this reason.  I cursed at Emacs too (in Swedish, as well) and the only solution I've found is to use the US Extended layout, but using my Swedish keyboard. I spent several years with a US keyboard as my main keyboard so I can switch more or less without thinking.  If you're not willing to go the layout-switching route, OS X Emacs in Swedish is just painful.  hr  Edit: Just found a hint for Spanish that might be of help. The idea is to remap the character that gets sent to Emacs to the one you desire. I haven't tried it, but it sounds promising.  <answer12100> It's not really elegant, but you could use the Escape key for meta and keep the alt key for special characters. E.g. codeESC x/code instead of codeM-x/code.  But agree with molbdnilo, most non-US keyboards suck for programming. I once worked in Finland for a couple of weeks, and the first thing I did was switch the KB to US. Even blind typing was easier than figuring out how to type those characters you need so often in programming languages. (well, actually the first thing I did was to switch the language; fortunately I knew how to do that by muscle memory :-)  <answer53551> See the options under codeM-x customize-group/code codens/code  There you can adjust the behavior of the modifier keys. I have set the right alt to "No modifier" - that's the same behavior as on PC keyboards with Alt-Gr.  Another setting I like is to unset both alt keys and use the codefunction/code key instead for alt.  <answer89982> I have also had this problem for years! Just recently I tried out Emacs in OS X again. I finally fixed the problem by adding the following in my .emacs: (This is with Emacs 24.3)  precode(when (eq system-type 'darwin)   (setq mac-right-option-modifier 'none)) /code/pre  <comment12610> This ought to have been fixed by now, you'd think... <comment12616> Yeah, it's almost as if the most common syntaxes were invented by Americans. ;-) <comment350174> Works for me...  you are not supposed to say thank you, but thank you.
