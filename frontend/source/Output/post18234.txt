Is there a keyboard shortcut to move cursor one word at a time in Terminal? <body> I love strongCMD-Ö/strong and strongCMD-Ä/strong (in German keyboards). Navigating through tabs is intuitive and comfortable.  But navigating through a command already typed into the terminals a pain in the ... - especially when the command is long. Trying to modify a command - may be correcting a spelling or adding an option flag or something - takes ages, because I have to navigate by cursor and it jumps only several positions per second.  strongOn Linux machines you can hold some keys pressed to jump whole words and such. That is much faster. Is it possible to do that on a Terminal of Mac, too?/strong  <answer18236> kbdESC/kbd and then kbdB/kbd moves back one word kbdESC/kbd and then kbdF/kbd moves forward one word  You can change the terminal settings to more sane shortcuts like kbdALT/kbd +  B and such: here's a link on how to do that http://blog.macromates.com/2006/word-movement-in-terminal/  <comment19904> Please ask one question at a time. I've edited your question to remove the second one; please ask it again as a separate question. <comment19905> @Nathan: I think the question is too broad, and ought to be closed as such. <comment19906> @Philip I think I've whipped it into shape. Do you think it's still a problem? <comment19908> @Nathan: Much better. <comment19917> @Nathan, thanks for your effort. I am trying to make the questions better in future. I'll ask the second one in a separate question.
