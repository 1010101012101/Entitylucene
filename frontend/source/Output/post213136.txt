Why does Xcode save my files in autosave information? <body> I ran into this problem today while writing code. Whenever I open a source file in Xcode, make changes and save them, the file will be copied to the "autosave information" folder and the references in the source tree view (command + 1) are changed to the new location.  Right now I cannot edit files "in place" but have to edit them and copy them back from "autosave information".  The code files are in a folder within "Shared" (my local "GitHub" repository folder to be exact). The account I'm using toÂ edit the files owns them and has r/w-permissions.  On another account which doesn't own the files but has r/w-permissions the problem doesn't occur.  My Mac is a MacBook Pro Retina 15" 2014, 2,2 Ghz i7 running OS X 10.10.5. Does anybody have an idea what's wrong and how to fix it?  hr  strongUPDATE/strong  So, I found out two things  ol liit happens with files outside of the "GitHub" folder in "Shared" as well/li liit only happens if I open a window in XCode and add files (the file I open first is saved in place, the added files are saved in "Autosave Information")/li /ol  Removing ACL permissions didn't help.  <comment257386> what are the permissions including ACL on the directory? and why in Shared - git is used to share things but each user has their own copy <comment257447> The permissions for the GitHub folder are `drwxrwxrwt  7 development  wheel  238  6 Okt 13:47 GitHub` the ACL for the GitHub folder is  `0: group:everyone allow list,add_file,search,delete,add_subdirectory,file_inherit,directory_inherit ` ("development" is the name of the account I use for development). I don't see why putting GitHub in Shared would be a bad idea. Is it? <comment257545> GitHub is the server - got is the tool that you are using and the design is each user has there own checkout so you can see who does what - it is not designed for sharing the checkout so could have issues <comment257655> @Mark I've been running this set-up for some time now and I never had a problem. So, I think it's unrelated to GitHub. <comment257656> Yes it is nothing to do with Github that is the server and no part of github is on  your machine <comment257711> That's not true (there are hidden `.git` folders on the machine which contain the change database the changes are mirrored online however). I also do not know what this would have to do with my question. <comment257717> got and github are different things, ir look at got manuals not Github (GitHub is just a git server) - also what do you mean by it happens with files outside of the "GitHub" folder in "Shared" <comment257921> I meant this happens with files outside of the "GitHub" as well. In other words the behavior is not restricted to the "GitHub" folder. Edited my post to clarify this, thanks.
