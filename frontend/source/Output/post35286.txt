Automator and Batch Adding Keywords to Images? <body> Is there a way to use automator (or something else) to batch add keywords to photos selected in finder?  <answer35308> h2iPhoto/h2  would do exactly that for you. You can define your own keywords by kbd⌘/kbd+kbdK/kbd and apply them using the "Manage my Keywords" window or the Info-pane kbd⌘/kbd+kbdi/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/61Z3t.png" alt="iPhoto manage my keywords"
