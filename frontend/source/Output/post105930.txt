How to update some application to latest version with homebrew-cask? <body> I noticed some packages provided by homebrew-cask uses a url of the latest version and a version number of "latest" such as dropbox and chrome. Thus they will never be upgraded with codebrew upgrade/code. Is there any simple way to update such packages using homebrew-cask?   And if I call codebrew cask install dropbox/code again, it shows there already exist some cache of old version, which I feel so dumb.  <answer118259> Try this command:  precodebrew cask install dropbox --force /code/pre  Please consider logging a bug over at homebrew-cask about your concerns with updating this kind of cask.  <answer230754> As of today brew cask does not implement upgrade but there is an open issue that tracks this at https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/4678  If you want to see it implemented sooner you could add your small contribution by fixing one of the todo items listed there.  <answer248471> This has really irked me so I created this script to update all Brew apps and allow the user to choose which Cask apps to update. You can exclude apps from consideration too.  https://github.com/derrekyoung/ScriptsAndUtils/blob/master/brew-cask-upgrade.sh  <comment130526> have you tried `brew update` <comment138009> https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask/issues/309, still in discussion <comment224928> is it safe to use? does it cleanly remove the old version while keeping its configuration? <comment224929> @ErikAllik your comment will unlikely to be seen here by the **brew cask** developers. Please can you start a new question or log a bug with [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask) directly. <comment281670> @Greg is wrong about this, read http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/230754/1916
