How can I change the background and text colour for messages in Mail.app <body> I much prefer reading white text on a black background. Is it possible for me to configure Mail.app so that messages are displayed white-on-black instead of the other way around?  <answer3123> Yup. Go to preferences - Fonts &amp; Colors - click "Select" on "Message font" - do your thing. :)  <answer117621> The more universal way to do this is to turn the entire screen opposite (White on Black).  System Preferences  Accessibility  Display  Invert Colors  You can assign a hotkey in System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Accessibility  Invert colors  Default shortcut is: ctrl + option + cmd + 8  <comment2776> I can use this to change the font, but the "Text Color" and "Document Color" options don't actually seem to do anything. <comment2792> My bad. Seems like you're right. I've tried Google but all results seem to point to the fact that you're stuck with the default colour. Sorry.
