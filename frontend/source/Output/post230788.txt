How to increase value of tcbhashsize parameter in OS X <body> I am running OS X 10.11 - El Capitan. I am trying to tune my TCP setting for better network / Internet performance. Most of the settings I have been able to modify permanently through strong/etc/sysctl.conf/strong configuration file.   I am trying to modify the value of strongnet.inet.tcp.tcbhashsize/strong to increase the number of TCP connections served and improve TCP lookup speeds. In Free BSD, it can be modified through /boot/loader.conf, but this file does not appear to exist in OS X.  strongHow can this value be modified in OS X?/strong  <answer230791> codesysctl/code is the tool of choice for this. codesysctl net.inet.tcp.tcbhashsize/code will tell you its value, and codesysctl -w net.inet.tcp.tcbhashsize=new_value/code will set the value. However on my system I got the error codesysctl: oid 'net.inet.tcp.tcbhashsize' is read only/code when I tried to set the value â€“ no idea if it's possible to set this value in some way without compiling and running your own kernel.
