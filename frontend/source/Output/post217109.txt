closing all notification alerts at once <body> The difference between alerts and banners is that alerts require user input to disappear, whereas banners go away on their own. strongIs there a way to close all notification alerts at once?/strong   In the example below, there are 6 alerts from one application. I'd like to be able to OPTION-click "Close" or hit a keyboard shortcut to dismiss all of them. Ideally, I'd be able to dismiss all alerts on a per application basis. But I'd settle for the ability to dismiss alerts universally.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OPstx.png" alt="Omnifocus alerts"  <comment303064> Duplicate? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155670/keyboard-shortcut-to-dismiss-notifications <comment303334> Close but not quite, since this question asks for a way to close _all_ notifications. @philpirozhkov <comment303335> Although that question has an answer, whereas mine doesn't, so yeah, the best solution for me is probably to implement the answer listed at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155670/keyboard-shortcut-to-dismiss-notifications
