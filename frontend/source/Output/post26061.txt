Can I tie a referrer to an app store purchase to the referred customer of the app? <body> I am trying to find out if I can have several referrers (call them websites for now), and when downloaded/installed from a referral, know where that users came from, for example to show the logo of the source "website" on their installation (pulled from my database).   Is this possible? Even if it cannot be done live and on the fly, I am trying to figure out if there is a way to get a report generated that has this information.
