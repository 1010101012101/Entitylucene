Automatic retry for mp3 stream for iOS <body> I need to run some app on iPod touch for infinite mp3. This task was solved by me on Linux just by running infinite loop that contains codemplayer/code command. So when connection is lost script waiting for it's appearance. How could I implement this on iOS?  <comment155349> Are you referencing a specific app or interested in your own app which will stream? <comment155356> If this app exists I will be glad to find out it. Do you now apps like that? Of course I can jailbreak my iPod and install mplayer... But I think there is more easier way out.
