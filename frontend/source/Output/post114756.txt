Iphone4s calendar events gone <body> The events I have entered are gone. I can not enter them. The + is not working. Facebook birthdays are still there.  Also all my list are gone.    <answer115145> In most cases, contacts and calendars "disappear" from the iPhone due to incorrect sync settings. On your iPhone, navigate to Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars and make sure to enable Calendar sync for each of your listed accounts.   <comment134414> There are two problems you might want to separate. 1) Are your events really gone? If so, restore from a backup and/or check online with your calendar service if you have set up a calendar service. [and we can't really guess which of these is your best plan since we don't know enough about your setup before the problem arose]. 2) Troubleshooting adding new events once you've resolved the missing events issue or decided to start fresh with a new calendar.
