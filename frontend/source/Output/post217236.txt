Search Spotlight for a file of specific type between two dates <body> I've had a hard time tracking down a way to search for documents of a specific type between two dates in Spotlight. Maybe it's not possible? I'd like to be able to type something like this in Spotlight:  codekind:pages modified:&gt;151120&amp;&lt;=151126/code  Which would then return Pages documents modified between November 21st and 26th, 2015. I've tried various date formats and searching for (Spotlight) alternatives, but no luck yet.   <answer217257> The date format needs to be same as the one that you set in codesystem preference/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xmKar.png" alt="enter image description here"  If your date format is same as the screenshot attached, then the search will become:  codekind:pages modified:&gt;11/20/15 modified:&lt;=11/26/15/code  Otherwise, you'll need to change the date format to the one that you have set in your codeLanguage &amp; Region/code (screenshot)
