Mac freezing, possible virus? <body> I am running Yosemite and experiencing very nasty freezing issues. Once I was able to recover from by reinstalling osx and second time (few months later) reinstalling alone didn't help, but also downgrading user from Admin rights did.  Here are the symptoms:   ul lifreezing applications, wheel mouse icon, occurring every 30 seconds or so and lasting about the same time. /li liCPU usage is near zero. Idle ~97%/li liran opensnoop, but it didn't correlate to frezing/li lionce freeze occurs, 'top' any Activity Monotor do not show any activity - they freeze too. But, after freeze ends, I can see the spike in CPU activity. Activity Monitor replays the past events in a fast-forward kind of way, at 10x speed. But there is no way to tell what activity transpired. System was frozen./li liit feels like 1/4 of one core of cpu is actually being used for OS itself./li lino hardware issues were discovered with AHT./li liSafe mode had no impact./li /ul  In the screenshot bellow, there is a blimp in CPU usage. That's the freeze. Sometimes they happen for longer, sometimes shorter duration.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/keFV9.png" alt="enter image description here"  I know it's relatively vague problem description, but I would like to hear some theories on what this could be. And if it happens again, how to actually pin point to the process that is causing it.  <answer288641> You can check which processes are using the most time interval in the system calls:  precodesudo fs_usage | grep -v 0.0000 /code/pre  supSee: How do I debug an out-of-control “kernel_task” process?/sup  In case your macOS experienced out-of-space scenario, some services can be still in a freeze mode (causing some freeze timeouts) and they need manual unpause by the following command:  precodekill -CONT -1 /code/pre  Otherwise check whether clean restart helps with anything.  If you had any unexpected shutdown after freeze, it's good to check for the shutdown code.  If won't help, if you experience another freeze, hit kbd⌘/kbd-kbd⌥/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd,/kbd (emCmd-Opt-Ctrl-Shift-Period/em), this will trigger codesysdiagnose/code process which will quickly gather system-wide diagnostic information helpful in investigating system memory/performance issues (will appear in code/var/tmp/code). If you're technical person, you can consider uncompressing the generated file and analyse the logs, or contact Apple support if they can help you.  If you believe you've a virus, just install antivirus (such as Sophos Home) to exclude that. But having antivirus, can cause another extra freezes as well, so it's up to you.  <comment243494> does it occur with and without network / Internet connection? <comment243495> yes. I turned off wifi once to test that - it had no effect on the freezing.
