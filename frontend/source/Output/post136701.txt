Simple text substitution in OS X using keyboard shortcut <body> I am constantly typing coderésumé/code in (Outlook) email messages.  Is there an easy way to associate this text with a keyboard shortcut?  I'd like this shortcut to be available in other applications (e.g. Word, Mail).   <answer136703> The easiest way would be to use Autocorrect shortcuts:  ul liGo to strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Text/strong/li liReplace: code[[[/code with: coderésumé/code/li li(Make sure "correct spelling automatically" is checked)/li /ul  The character combination code[[[/code is just an example. Everytime I type code[[[/code it's automatically replaced with coderésumé/code. This applies system wide. You can use any set of not often used character(s). It functions as a keyboard shortcut.   <comment162258> I found that just after I posted the question.  Hard part is deciding what character sequence should represent `résumé`. <comment162259> @craig any character sequence you wouldn't use normally while typing. I used `[[[` because I don't use that sequence often, except maybe in Terminal, which is exempt from autocorrection. <comment162260> Interesting: works in Outlook and Mail (subject and body fields), but not in Word, Excel, Safari, or Firefox. <comment162263> Some apps, like Word, have their own substitution tables and do not use stuff from Apple.  In Apple apps, you must also look at Edit  Substitutions to make sure it is activated for the particular app.
