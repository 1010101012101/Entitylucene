Retina MacBook Pro - External display resolution issues <body> I am not sure if this is a problem with my TV or my Retina MBP. I've had an early 2011 MBP before my rMBP and this was never an issue.  It seems that when I connect up my TV, it 'detects' the screen orientation as portrait. The resolutions shown are all portrait (eg. 1140 x 2560) - but this does get shown on my TV as a landscape resolution...   While the screen orientation being weird is one issue, the other issue is that I cannot find a resolution that is supported by my TV, for example 1080p or 720p isn't even listed.   Has anyone else run into this problem? Do I have an issue with my TV or rMBP?  I am connecting via HDMI and have also tried mini display port to HDMI. I am on Yosemite.  <answer164773> While this might not provide a direct answer to your question, I would be interested in the EDID (emExtended display identification data/em) of that display.  Run codeioreg -l | grep EDID/code on terminal to get all the EDIDs listed. Your output then includes one line for each display connected, such as code"IODisplayEDID"  =&lt;00ffffffffffff000...&gt;/code. Take the part in between code&lt;/codeand code&gt;/code, that is your edid. Note that the short EDID/the first one is probably the one of your internal display, which has no resolution information on it.  Now you need something to read out the EDID, I used the http://www.edidreader.com website. Unfortunately they require the hex to be split and prefixed with code0x/code. Ruby to the rescue! coderuby -e 'puts "0x" + ARGV[0].scan(/.{2}|.+/).join(" 0x")' 'YOUR EDID HERE'/code.  The EDID contains multiple blocks of possible resolutions, called timings. They can be found in   ul liTiming Bitmap/li liVideo Data Block/li liDetailed Timing Descriptor #/li /ul  Does the display offer proper resolutions? Can you try with a different cable or a different machine?  <comment193148> Are you connecting the TV via HDMI or AirPlay Mirroring? <comment193150> @nipponese HDMI <comment193152> OS X version, TV model? <comment195032> Isolate the components: test with another computer, cable, display. Until the problematic component is isolated, we're shooting in the dark!
