Can't use launchctl as non-root user <body> I was trying to set up the grooved - a music player daemon. It works over codedbus/code which I installed through Homebrew.  In the caveats of the codedbus/code formula it says:  precodeTo start dbus: brew services start dbus /code/pre  When I try to run this exact command I get   precode/Users/user/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.dbus.plist: Operation not permitted ==&gt; Successfully started `dbus` (label: homebrew.mxcl.dbus) /code/pre  Running the same command with codesudo/code works just fine. But I don't think this can be the solution to this. Also I want to use codedbus/code to communicate with codegrooved/code using my user account and not root.  I tried loading and starting codeplist/code files by hand. Making sure they are in the right location (code/Users/user/Library/LaunchAgents/code) with the right permissions/ownership:  precode.rw-------      user staff  homebrew.mxcl.dbus.plist .rw-r--r--      user staff  local.grooved.plist /code/pre  It's the same. I can't use codelaunchctl/code with my non-root user.  Interstingly using the new commands things work:  precode$ launchctl bootstrap gui/501 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.dbus.plist $ launchctl kickstart gui/501/homebrew.mxcl.dbus $ launchctl bootout gui/501 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.dbus.plist /code/pre  I don't need to run these as root. But codegrooved/code can't see the codedbus/code:   precodeError creating dbus service: Could not get session bus: dbus: couldn't determine address of session bus /code/pre  If somebody could point me into the right direction where the problem could be... It can't all be a bug in codegrooved/code because codelaunchctl/code doesn't seem to work correctly for me.   hr  This is El Capitan 10.11.6
