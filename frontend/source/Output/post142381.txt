Backoffice iOS App without showing up in the App Store <body> I have an app on the App Store for people to download where they can use "vouchers" to get discounts in some shops (which are my partners). I would like to know if it's possible to create a "backoffice" app for my partners (for voucher validation, etc.), without being shown in the AppStore.  I want to know if it's possible to make a valid iOS Application to give to my partners, either by being in the App Store and not be directly visible to normal users (a private link for instance), or directly "giving" them the App, like with Android.  Or is the only way to give them the App, by being publicly available at the App Store?  <comment167739> Are you asking how to implement a parallel app store? If not (and if so), could you clarify this a bit with how you think things would work? <comment167759> is it still unclear what i'm asking? I'm not english, but cmon.. <comment167768> @samh It's more complicated than that. Code level development is clearly *off topic* but how Enterprise Provisioning and/or iTunes Connect works on a technical level are **on topic** hence putting this on hold. As written I can't tell if it's on topic or off topic, so it's unclear hence the hold. <comment167803> The term you're probably looking for is "apple ad hoc distribution" try giving that a google. <comment167830> @Tyson thank you for *finally* being helpful on this thread for the tip, yup that's basically it, just like Test Flight (which I have used for internal testing before). But is this 'legit'? I mean, isn't ad hoc distribution only reserved for testing and showcasing alpha/beta/production versions for interested parties? <comment167831> @bmike I don't know who *samh* is, but since I've searched on the stack exchange websites list and there is no site for iOS or App Store, *and* since this is not a code related question I would not ask it on stackoverflow, so yes, I believe this channel was the most appropriate for my question. <comment167838> I think this is what I was looking for: https://developer.apple.com/programs/volume/b2b/
