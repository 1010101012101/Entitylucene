Ive lost find phone on one of my networked phones <body> find phone worked great, now I'm missing a phone (in find phone) and can't seem to get it recognized?  <comment372376> could someone have deleted this service permanently <comment372396> Can you try and explain this more clearly? Is a device not showing up in the list on find my iPhone? <comment372408> It is probably impossible to have a phone just completely vanish from Find My iPhone unless your attacker knows both your device password and your iCloud password.
