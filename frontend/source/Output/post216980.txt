Sync a macbook's iTunes library from an offline library stored on a disk <body> I know that it's possible to store one's music library on an external disk attached to an Airport Extreme or an AirPort Time Capsule: Option + iTunes, "Choose Library...".  One can also store a minimal music collection on a MacBook. When away from home, one would use that minimal music collection. At home, one would switch to the large library.  Is it possible to setup the local (on the MacBook) music collection to be automatically updated via a smartlist from the main music collection?  <comment266309> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/216980/sync-a-macbooks-itunes-library-from-an-offline-library-stored-on-a-disk <comment266584> @BerthaAliciaCÃ¡rdenas Did you mean to point to another Q&A? You have just pointed to this very question.
