How to make menu-bar auto-hide/appear faster? <body> There is a 0.5s delay and then the animation starts to roll the menu bar down. I know it doesn't sound a lot but in practice it gets annoying when I multitask and trying get tasks done fast.  Is there a way to remove the delay and trigger the animation instantaneously? Also, is there way to make the animation faster, or perhaps disable it?  <answer228002> If by menu-bar you mean the dock, you can disable it.  Under System Preferences you'll find a submenu for Dock settings  <answer228016> I suspect that by the 'menu bar', the OP actually meant the 'menu bar'.  In El Capitan. Just a guess, but given Apple's historical possessiveness about the menu bar, I doubt there is an easy option. Happy to be wrong though...
