Why I can't remove linux partitions on macOS Sierra <body> I'm trying to strongremove linux partition/strong from my iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) on MacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta 2, So I tried existing solutions by strongusing Disk Utility/strong, I tried from Recovery as well, But it says      You can not remove this volume because the previous volume can not be resized   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzpMT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Vnxc.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uX8NV.png" alt="enter image description here"  Some existing solutions use Terminal but I have no idea about that.  strongI need a simplest and easiest way to remove these linux partitions and grow my mac partition./strong   <answer287973> You can't expand a macOS partition to lower block numbers (i.e. to the "beginning of a disk") with on-board macOS tools.  Basically you have to remove all useless partitions, clone or restore your main macOS drive to a new partition on the same drive and delete the old one.   strongPreparation:/strong    ul liBackup your data./li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either Ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server./li liVerify and repair your main macOS volume with Disk Utility/li /ul  strongModify partition table:/strong  ul liOpen in the menubar Utilities/Terminal  First you should get an overview of your disks and the partition layout:/li liEnter codediskutil list/codebr Example listing:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        500.1 GB    disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                    209.7 MB    disk0s1    2:           Linux Filesystem                        499.1 MB    disk0s2    3:                 Linux Swap                          2.0 GB    disk0s3    4:           Linux Filesystem                        247.5 GB    disk0s4    5:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X               248.6 GB    disk0s5    6:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD            650.0 MB    disk0s6    7:                  Apple_HFS Recovery HD            650.0 MB    disk0s7 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                         *1.3 GB    disk1    1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        *1.3 GB    disk1s2 /dev/disk2-~disk14... /code/pre  /dev/disk1-~disk14 ...belong to the macOS Base System (your recovery system you booted to previously)  disk0 is your main internal disk device containing the EFI-partition (dis0s1), some Linux partitions (disk0s2-disk0s4), your main macOS volume (disk0s5) and two Recovery HDs (disk0s6/disk0s7) one of which is useless -

Therefore a solution is even more complex than the linked one. Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show disk0` entered in Terminal to your question! <comment363582> @klanomath Here is the [screenshot](http://imgur.com/hutUB6I) <comment363591> Thanks. @klanomath Will my data on "disk0s5" be deleted? <comment363592> @RashMendis the step `dd if=/dev/disk0s5 of=/dev/disk0s2 bs=1m` makes a copy of your current disk0s5 to disk0s2. Afterwards disk0s5 will be deleted...and disk0s2 is your new OS X with all your previous data. <comment363593> Thanks @klanomath again for the quick response. I'll try and let you know. <comment363714> I'm in step `dd your "old" macOS partition disk0s5 to the new partition disk0s2:` now its more than 5 hours but still it processing. **Do you have any idea of duration?** <comment363738> But now it's 7.5 hours  <comment363741> Can't hear. But not sure since this is a iMac <comment363856> Yes it worked! It took 17hrs. Thanks @klanomath <comment363859> @RashMendis 17 hours means an average combined r/w speed of 8.2 MB/s. That's really slow...
