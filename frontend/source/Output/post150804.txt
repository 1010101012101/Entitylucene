How to refresh the shared list in the Finder's side panel? <body> In the left side of the Finder, under codefavorites/code and codedevices/code there is a codeshared/code list that contains computers and other devices on the network. I use the MacBook in two places, both with wifi. When I switch between these places, the Mac automatically connects to the wifi network there, but sometimes the Finder's shared list still contains the devices in the previous network.  If I close the laptop's lid and open it again, the list refreshes, but is there any other/better way to trigger the refresh? Why doesn't the refresh happens automatically?  <answer150809> Relaunch the Finder  kbdoption/kbd+kbdright click/kbd [or kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdleft click/kbd] the Finder icon in the Dock, last item is Relaunch.  Or try this I found on StackOverflow Automator Command to Refresh ALL Finder/all Finder Windows - works for Finder windows, can't test for Shared items.  precodetell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view          end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat   end tell /code/pre  <answer182403> Also turning WiFi off and back on should refresh the shared list.  <answer241715> I've just had the very same problem (OS X El Capitan) and refreshing the Finder didn't work out for me. Neither turning off and then back on the WiFi.  What worked for me was restarting the router.  <answer294702> One method I've found to refresh the list of shared computers in the sidebar strongemwithout/em/strong quitting the Finder or restarting the machine is this:  precode$ sudo ipconfig set en1 DHCP /code/pre  (replace codeen1/code with whatever interface is active on your system)  Another, slightly more disruptive command that works for me is to completely down the network interface(s) with codeifconfig/code and then bring them back up:  precode$ sudo ifconfig en1 down; sleep 1; sudo ifconfig en1 up /code/pre  This has the unfortunate side-effect of killing any active states/connections (including virtual machine traffic). So, the first command is usually preferred. I am still actively seeking more precise means to refresh whatever daemon is caching this information.
