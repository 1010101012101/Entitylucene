What programs exist to find and delete "orphan files" left after deleting an Application? <body> I have transferred my system from Mac to Mac for over 15 years. I have preference files and other plists lurking around in my system for programs I tested years ago.   Is there a smart program that could point me to these orphan files knowing that the application that created them is not on my system?  <answer63337> OnyX has several cleaning options and might be worth a try.   Other than that, you could check the installation receipts in code/Library/Receipts/code and code~/Library/Receipts/code. Applications that are installed via installers should write to this directory with what they've installed and where. You could inspect this for programs that you've em'uninstalled'/em and manually remove the lurking files.  <answer63352> If you are willing to use Terminal.app you can use codefind/code to identify files/folders which haven't been accessed for a long time.  ul licodefind ~/Library/Preferences -atime +52w/code will list all prefences which haven't been accessed in the last 52 weeks. /li licodefind -d ~/Library/Preferences -atime +52w -ok rm '{}' \;/code will ask whether you want to delete it file by file/li /ul  and if you don't want to get asked for each file, run  precodefind -d ~/Library/Preferences -atime +52w -delete /code/pre  <answer64018> I'm not connected to the company but if you want a paid app In the past I have used App Zapper.  It is a drag and drop app. You drag the app to the window and it shows all dependencies for you to delete or not. I did a clean install for ML so I haven't used it in quite some time and I'm afraid I don't recall the cost but I remember it was not expensive. UPDATE: It cost $12.95; More than I remembered.  Perhaps Pacifist could be used; Open the uninstalled version of the app in Pacifist (drag it there) and look to see what gets installed, then remove those items?  <comment75218> Thank you for your reply. However, as I said, the application that created the files is not anymore on my system. Appzapper is good for deinstalling programs though. <comment75219> I didn't know the existence of these "receipts". Very interesting. I might develop a little tool for that. Thanks. <comment75220> Correct, although the task is a bit more difficult as I don't want to remove files belonging to an actual program on my computer. Mixing what you say with the answer of CraftyThumber, I might come up with a pretty good solution. Let's see what my scripting can do ! <comment75323> @Barth: I'd be interested in the result if you manage it :) <comment263721> How to run this command without typying `y` all the time? <comment263722> @konrad see updated answer
