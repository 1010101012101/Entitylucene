Unknown backups on main hard drive <body> On my MacBook's 'About This Mac' pane there is a section that is taking up a lot of storage it is titled 'Backups'. Now I do use a Time Capsule but I don't know why it would be labeled under my MacBook's hard drive. Can anyone help me identify and solve this problem? Here is a screenshot of what I see. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/stLiw.png" alt="About This Mac Pane"  <answer163787> Those might be Local Backups Feature of Time Machine.     Local snapshots complement regular Time Machine backups that are stored on your external disk or Time Capsule by creating a local backup on your startup disk when your normal backup drive is not available. This provides you with a "safety net" for times when you might be away from your external backup disk or Time Capsule but accidentally delete a file. When your normal backup is available again, Time Machine copies the local snapshot contents from your startup disk to your normal backup drive.

Just common curtsey.
