Near-realtime RSS push notifications for iPhone? <body> I have an RSS feed that is updated multiple times a day. I want to get near realtime push notifications on an iPhone when there is an update to the feed.  I've played around with e.g. IFTTT + Pushbullet, but that only updates every 30min or so.  Are there any existing solutions (app-only or app plus server-side) that i could use?  Thanks!
