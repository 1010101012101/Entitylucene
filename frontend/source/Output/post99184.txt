Where are iTunes smart playlists stored on disk? <body> I want to create a emBest albums/em smart playlist containing a emsomewhat reasonable/em number of songs :     ul lithe rule codeAlbum rating/code codeis greater than/code code★★★/code result in a 221 songs playlist.  /li liwheareas the rule codeAlbum rating/code codeis greater than/code code★★/code result in a 4000+ songs playlist./li /ul  I understand why those numbers, but still I would prefer that the resulting playlist contains ~1000 songs : hence my need to have access to the smart playlist file definition so I can overwrite the ratings representation inside.    emOther approach tried : activate half star ratings (to create a 'greater than 3.5 stars' rule), but if half star is activated for song rating in the main window, it is not the case for the smart playlist dialog./em  <answer99190> In the smart playlist edit panel, just specify a max limit for the number of songs (eg: max 1,000 songs or max 4GB), and also choose that it should choose the highest rated songs to reach that limit.  <comment116610> Based on which criteria do you want to limit the number of songs down to 1000? <comment116611> @patrix the album rating. For eg if in the underlying smart playlist xml file there is *3/albumRatingMin* I would edit it to 3.5 and see how many tracks pass that threshold, and adjust the value accordingly <comment116613> The definition is stored in `~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml` (big file, search for the name of the smart list). The playlist definition seems to be stored as binary data though... <comment116618> If I do that then selected albums are deprived of their lowest rated songs. I want albums to be full. Too bad there is not a "Limit N items selected by highest album rating" option. <comment116679> @kraymer if you're on a mac you could create an applescript or perhaps automator script to create a playlist. That would allow you to make it choose entire albums.
