Mirroring iPhone 5 to MacBook Pro without Airplay <body> Unfortunately my corporate network doesn't support AirPlay. What alternatives are there to  mirroring an iOS 7 device (iPhone 5) to a MacBook Pro running Mavericks?  Note: I don't want to output to a TV because I need to be able to share the mirrored iPhone output via Webex.  <answer118315> Have your Macbook run its own WiFi network, tether your phone to that network, and then you can AirPlay directly without hitting the corporate network.  <comment138072> That is a fine suggestion, however I don't have the luxury of having a wired connection connected to the laptop. It doesn't look like I can create a network in parallel with being connected to another network. <comment138075> Absent an ethernet connection, this is correct; if you do this, you will get AirPlay mirroring at the expense of your network connection.
