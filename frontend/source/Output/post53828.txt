Is there a hotkey/shortcut for Print to Web Receipts folder? <body> I love the "Save PDF to Web Receipts Folder" in Safari and use it all the time. The only minor annoyance is that it takes a few steps (cmd+P - click "PDF" - select "Save PDF to Web Receipts Folder") to use it. Is there a way to setup a hotkey/shortcut for it so that it just takes one quick key combo?  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1vYnz.png" alt="Example of the &#39;Save PDF to Web Receipts Folder&#39; function in Safari"  <answer53854> Create a very basic Automator Service Applescript with GUI Scripting.

The issue was that I had another global hotkey that was conflicting with the hotkey I was trying to use. Once I changed that it started working as expected. Thanks!
