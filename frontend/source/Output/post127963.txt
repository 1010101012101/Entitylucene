Display scroll bar for longer <body> I'm one of these people who likes to grab the scroll bar and move it around now-n-then when I'm not using the scroll wheel on my mouse.  But what I find really annoying is I have to scroll to get it to appear, which is fine, but it disappears before I can grab it.  How can I increase the duration that the scroll bar shows before it disappears?  <answer127978> Run  precodedefaults write -g NSOverlayScrollerHideDelay -float 3 /code/pre  where code3/code is a value in seconds and quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.  I found the preference key by running codemdfind kMDItemContentType=public.unix-executable -onlyin /System|xargs strings 2&gt;/dev/null|grep -E '^[[:alnum:].-]{10,80}$'|grep -i scroll/code.  <answer127986> One other option is to set up the behaver via one of the three options in "System Preferences=General":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TfLtJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment149977> Worked perfectly. I set it to 5 seconds :D
