Is there a way to delete related but undeleted files of removed applications? <body> It's been like 2 years I've used Mac OS X, but I really don't like the way applications are managed, especially when we have to delete them, or when we update the operating system, XCode, or any vital program for making my Mac OS function properly.  I've deleted ignorantly many applications by just trashing them, but I've discovered that these applications could create other folders and files somewhere else, which I probably didn't delete.  My question are:   ol liIs there a way to delete all the related but undeleted files of removed applications? Like cached, configuration, etc, files./li liAre there any folders where these applications usually store these files?/li /ol  emNote: in many cases I would not know anymore which applications I've deleted, so don't tell me to look in the official website of the application for a solution or a script that does it automatically. I'm looking for a more general solution./em  <answer254245> I use a nice little free app called App Cleaner for the same reason/purpose. (I am not affiliated with AppCleaner. strongNote:/strong I was asked by Dan to insert a disclaimer when suggesting a product I am not affiliated with.)  It has been very effective in finding and deleting all associated files and gives you the option to view and deselect certain files, if needed, prior to deletion.  The App Cleaner is available on the App Store.  strongFrom the developer:/strong     Main Advantage: App Cleaner deletes Remains (or leftovers) - files of   previously removed apps. Thus, you uninstall applications completely.      strongMain Features:/strong       ul   liScan the system and preview installed applications/li   liRemove all types of service files/li   liRemove remains of previously uninstalled apps  /li   liReset application to a first-launch state/li   liEasy-to-use shortcuts/li   liAny file or app quick preview/li   liSpecific app-associated file formats preview/li   liIn-app help assistance/li   liShow unused applications/li   liSkip list option/li   /ul      strongHow to Uninstall an application using App Cleaner:/strong      ol   liLaunch App Cleaner./li   liScan all applications for service files./li   liChoose unneeded application (left view).
