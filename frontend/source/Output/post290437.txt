Bootcamp – saving Windows Support software is taking a very long time <body> I am trying to install Windows 10 on my MacBook Pro mid 2012 running macOS Sierra using a 64 GB thumbdrive, and everything runs smoothly — until I reach the part where it says saving Windows Support software. I've been stuck at this place for roughly 1-2 hours already, and I'm wondering: am I doing something wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
