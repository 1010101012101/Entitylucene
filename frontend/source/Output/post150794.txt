How do I reset/change my security questions on my Apple Id <body> I have an Apple ID and I know my password, but forgot the answer to the security question. I tried to change it at appleid.apple.com but we don't have a link to reset it. See the picture. Please help me ASAP.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qGbrE.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Edit your Apple ID website"  <answer150795> You can't see the link as you only get a few attempts at getting the answers correct.  Apple Support Document     If you can't reset your security questions      Contact Apple Support in either of these circumstances:           You don't see the link to send a reset email, which means you don't have a rescue address.          You see the link to send a reset email, but you don't have access to email at the rescue address.         A temporary support PIN isn't usually required, but Apple may ask you to generate a PIN if your identity needs to be verified.
