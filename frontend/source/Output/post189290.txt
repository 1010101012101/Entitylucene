Shared Calendars not available in Outlook 2011 <body> Shared Calendars is not available in my Navigation Pane.  I am trying to add colleagues calendars. I understand they should show up in a Shared Calendars Section in the Navigation Pane. But I don't have that section at all. Have I hidden that somehow? Is there a way to add it back?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TC4PE.png" alt="enter image description here"  I use this process to add the shared calendar:  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/912265  ol liOn the File menu, point to Open, and then click Other User's Folder./li liClick Find User /li liType the name of the person who granted you access, click Find, click the person's name, and then click OK. /li liOn the Type menu, click Calendar, and then click OK./li liThe shared calendar appears in the navigation pane under the Shared heading./li /ol  I know that the calendar is shared properly because other colleagues with same version of Mac &amp; Outlook are able to view it.  Software:  - Outlook 2011 version 14.5.1  - OS-X 10.9.5 Mavericks  <answer242617> I have searched on the web for days on how to resolve this issue but no solution.  Here is how I solved mine;  Delete your Outlook profile as the calendar is corrupt on it  Link: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c  Then, close and reopen outlook, you will be prompted to create a new profile.  Go back to your calendar on outlook. Add a calendar now and it should show up on the left view.  It worked for me and it should work for you.
