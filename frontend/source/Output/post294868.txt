"USB Port of death" or back luck? Two disappearing external HDDs <body> I have 2 external HDDs that went through exactly the same pattern within a couple weeks.  One is a regular 3"1/2 disk and the other one a laptop SSD. Both were external usb disks with different enclosures and interfaces.  In both cases, I shut down the computer and the disks were nowhere to be found when turning the computer back on.  I tried my other MBP, they're both not visible. I tried on a PC, same thing. I removed the drives from their enclosure and put them directly in a PC instead of going through USB and the bios doesn't even list them!  the regular hd powers up; I can hear it spin and the head doing it's initialization noise, but diskutil doesn't see it.  the ssd has a led showing it's on, but it doesn't blink at all like it used to, so there is no activity.  so, the two possibilities here are:  ul libad luck/li lithere is a common hardware problem; and the only common point is my old 2011 MBP; I used the same port for both disks./li /ul  Is it possible that the usb port fried both interfaces? (since the hd still powers up properly, I'm assuming it's controller is working fine).
