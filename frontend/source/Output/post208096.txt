Prevent Airport Utility from Opening Automatically <body> My computer is connected to a (non-Airport) wifi network and is working properly.  However, someone else in my building uses an Airport. Every few hours, Airport Utility opens, and shows me this other network, as if I wanted to configure it. Is there some way I can either forget this Airport device, or disable Airport Utility from automatically opening?

Deselect the option to monitor base stations or select the option to only monitor base stations that you have set up.  <comment251042> I've tried that. Now I'll just have to wait it out... <comment251051> ...and that didn't work.
