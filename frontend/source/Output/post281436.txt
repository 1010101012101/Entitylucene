Where can I find the system icons for Mail? <body> I'm trying to track down the .icns files for these icons: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vARCN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any ideas? Not seeing them in the app resource folder.   <answer281462> Go to the Applications folder, right click on the Mail icon, click on the "Show Package Contents ", double click the "Contents" folder, double click the "Resources" folder. The tool bar icons should be in that folder (mine are, in Snow Leopard)  <answer281556> Obviously in macOS Sierra, Apple has changed how it packages some of the application resources and in this particular case the image assets that comprise the toolbar are still in emMail.app/Contents/Resources//em, at least some of them, in the emassets.car/em file as shown in the image farther below. Note that there are several em.car/em files in the emResources/em folder, however looking at the open files for Mail.app in Activity Monitor, there are em.car/em archives outside of the application bundle that are open as well, e.g.:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/VibrantLightAppearance.car /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/SystemAppearance.car /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/Assets.car /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AccountsUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Assets.car /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/FunctionRowAppearance.car /code/pre  ul liNote: Check in Activity Monitor on your system for a complete list of open files for Mail.app./li /ul  Doing a few Google searches, I found a few different apps, both GUI and CL, and had mixed results in both viewing and extracting assets from the em.car/em archives. However, that was using only precompiled programs, and there are a few Xcode Projects I didn't test.  The one in the image below is ThemeEngine and while is actually showed more emobjects/em then Asset Catalog Tinkerer did, and opened some em.car/em files that Asset Catalog Tinkerer couldn't, the drawback is ThemeEngine doesn't have an export function like Asset Catalog Tinkerer did. However, I could still copy and paste out of ThemeEngine though. Maybe the Xcode Projects would work better if I compiled then on my system, but just don't have the time to try.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5pjq7.png" alt="ThemeEngine showing Mail.app Assets.car file."  <comment354155> The sidebar icons are there... is there a sub directory with button icons? I'm not seeing them. <comment354157> @AaronBenjamin The icons have been there up to El Capitan's Mail - in Sierra they aren't! <comment354158> Any idea where they've run off to?
