core dumps in Mac OS X <body> I was wondering if core dumps are disabled by default in Mac OS X, or if we have to add the following line to our code.bash_profile/code:  precodeulimit -S -c 0 /code/pre  <answer154580> By default, ulimits on OS X have a soft limit of 0 and a hard limit of unlimited.  You can verify this by opening a Terminal and running codeulimit -S -c/code and codeulimit -H -c/code.  <comment170671> What is Your output of: `sysctl -a | grep coredump` ? <comment170672> `$ sysctl -a | grep coredump kern.coredump = 1 kern.sugid_coredump = 0 kern.coredump: 1 kern.sugid_coredump: 0`
