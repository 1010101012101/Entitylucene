Is there a way to add keyboard shortcuts to preference panes? <body> I wanted to add a keyboard shortcut to teleport via the System Preferences.   teleport is a preference pane not an application so I can't select it.   I tried to assign my keyboard to "All applications" but it didn't work.  Edit: I am more looking for assigning a keyboard shortcut to a Preference pane menu item than assigning a global shortcut to a preference pane.   For example, in teleport I want to assign a shortcut to the menu item "Deactivate teleport". One can access to this menu item by clicking on the teleport icon in the OS X menu bar.  <answer126409> System Preferences panes are applications.   You can find them in :   ul licode/System/Library/PreferencePanes/code (Apple's Prefpanes)/li licode/Library/Preferences/code (System Wide preferences)/li licode~/Library/PreferencePanes/code (User only preferences) /li /ul  <answer126412> You can create an Automator based service that opens the specific preference pane.  You can find the preference pane bundles in the codeLibrary/PreferencePanes/code set of folders:  ul li/System/Library/PreferencePanes/li li/Library/PreferencePanes/li li~/Library/PreferencePanes/li /ul  Preference panes are special bundles that when opened from the Finder, will launch strongSystem Preferences.app/strong and automatically switch to their settings.  ol liCreate an Automator Service/li liDrag the desired preference pane onto the Automator workflow/li liAdd the strongOpen Finder Items/strong action…/li li…and select strongSystem Preferences.app/strong in the action/li liAdd a strongWatch Me Do/strong action to record any clicks and interactions with the panel/li /ol  To assign this workflow as a keyboard shortcut, see this Tuts+ tutorial, How to Launch Any App with a Keyboard Shortcut.  <comment148045> I don't get it, how does one make a shortcut exactly to one of the Prefs? <comment148151> Awesome! Thanks you. I updated my question to make it clearer about what I what exactly looking for. <comment148154> I have extended the answer to mention the "Watch Me Do" Automator action; use this to record clicks and other menu item interactions as part of your workflow. Hope this helps! <comment148297> This is awesome! Thank you.
