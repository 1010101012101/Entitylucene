How to make custom routes survive reboots? <body> I use a VPN to connect to the network of my company and add some routes.  After connecting and addding the routes it works just fine. Is there a way to permanently add the routes so that they survive reboots? Currently, I run a shell script to configure them after connecting to the VPN, but I always need to be root to do this.  I'm not experienced with OS X but familiar with UNIX.  <answer126169> See this script (don't forget to change codeADDRESS/MASK GATEWAY/code with your values ):   precode$ sudo mkdir /Library/StartupItems/AddRoute # cd /Library/StartupItems/AddRoute $ echo "{         Description     = \"Add static routing tables\";         Provides        = (\"AddRoutes\");         Requires        = (\"Network\");         OrderPreference = \"None\"; }" &gt; StartupParameters.plist $ echo "#!/bin/sh  # Set up static routing tables  . /etc/rc.common  StartService () {         ConsoleMessage "Adding Static Routing Tables"         sudo route add ADDRESS/MASK GATEWAY }  StopService () {         return 0 }  RestartService () {         return 0 }  RunService "$1" &gt; AddRoutes $ sudo chmod 755 AddRoutes /code/pre  <comment147718> Possibly answered in https://superuser.com/questions/35971/mac-10-6-cisco-vpn-can-i-run-scripts-apps-on-connection <comment147760> i did that ofc i also used this script: http://nellen.it/blog/2012/01/permanent-static-routes-for-mac-os-x/ which is by looks the same and I get the error unbound variable in line 31 :o
