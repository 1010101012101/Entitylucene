Is there a way to trigger iPad sleep using gestures? <body> 5-finger gestures allow you to do almost anything without pressing any of the 2 iPad buttons: except putting the iPad to sleep.   Anyone aware of a way to do this without pressing a button?  <answer101018> You can enable the assistive touch panel. From this panel you can put the iPad to sleep with the touch screen.  To enable assistive touch:  ol liTap Settings/li liIn Settings Submenu tap General/li liScroll down the General submenu to find Accessibility./li liTap Accessibility./li liIn the Accessibility submenu tap AssistiveTouch/li liTrigger Assistive Touch into ON state/li /ol  This menu (which can be minimized into every corner on your screen) allows you to do several actions using the touch screen, including sleeping the iOS device.
