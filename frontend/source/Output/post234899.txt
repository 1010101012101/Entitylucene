What types of words can Siri understand easily <body> Siri has a lot of trouble understanding my Irish accent. for example when I ask it to add something to my "Quick" list, it complains that it can't find the "Quit" list.  How can I find a set of words whose pronunciation is so distinct that Siri can understand them unambiguously?   If I choose my list names from that set it might make my siri interaction a bit easier.  <comment287220> How precisely do you speak to Siri? I find it understands my broad Yorkshire far better than my partner's perfect RP... because I just talk to it & she enunciates like it was a small, confused child. <comment287223> @Tetsujin hmmm, I do enunciate, and the more siri gets mixed up, the slower and more deliberate I get, creating a negative feedback loop! I'll try to speak more naturally.
