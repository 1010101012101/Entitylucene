How can I disable the music player on an iPhone 4S lock screen <body> How do I disable the music player controls on the iPhone 4S lock screen? I've tried setting the "triple click home button" to "off", but it didn't help.  <answer52111> I'm afraid this is not possible by default on your iPhone. It's a feature in iOS and there is no easy way to disable this.  You could jailbreak your iPhone, you can buy Springtomize for $2,99 which will allow you to do what you want. Just turn on the "Hide Top Bar" option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XV7e3.png" alt="enter image description here"
