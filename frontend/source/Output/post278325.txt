My macbook pro (mid 2012, 13") left side of screen has colored vertical lines. Please help <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t4hut.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  My macbook started to look like this a little while ago, first it was black (what now are colored lines) and now it is like this. I dont know why it could have happend but my best guess would be that my charger had something to do. Please help me  <comment350218> Quick diagnostic... take a screenshot [cmd/shift/3] does the artefact appear on the screenshot? If yes, it's software, if no, it's hardware... & extremely unlikely to be the charger. <comment350222> it does not appear so what should or can i do <comment350228> Next step - repair shop.
