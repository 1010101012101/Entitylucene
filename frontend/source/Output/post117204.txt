How to print PDF documents without highlights in Preview.app <body> I was trying to print a PDF document in which I highlighted some texts. In the printing preview, I saw those highlights, which I didn't really want for the printed document. I tried to disable the highlights but didn't find such an option, and ended up removing all the highlights before printing. So, does such an option (hiding highlights for printing) exist in Preview at all? Thanks.  By the way, I'm using Preview 7.0 (826) on OS X 10.9.1.  <answer117224> In Preview.app there isn't an option, although there is a way:     ol   liOpen your .pdf document /li   liSelect All (kbdCommand/kbd kbdA/kbd)/li   liEverything should be highlighted/li   likbdControl/kbd mouse click on any page/li   liFrom the popup menu  select the circle with a slash through it/li   /ol   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRUD6.png" alt="enter image description here"     ol start="6"   liPrint your document/li   liPress kbdCommand/kbd kbdZ/kbd to undo (re-enable highlights)/li   /ol   <answer237031> There no easy way to do this with Preview as of v8. You should request the feature with Apple.  The best way to do this is to print the PDF with Acrobat instead. I'm testing with Acrobat Standard Pro v10.1. There, in the print dialog, you can can choose to print only the document or the document with markup.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4zjlm.png" alt="Print options to remove markup in Acrobat"  The solution by I'L'I will only remove highlights in Preview but not comments. Those will still be printed.
