iPhone screen stays black after phone call <body> After talking on my iPhone 6s for more than a few minutes (using the standard Phone app) the screen goes black and does not light up again. The sleep/wake button and home button don't make the screen light up either.  strongHow can I make my phone's screen light up during a phone call so I can hang up?/strong  <comment335408> @Tetsujin I radically improved this question as I believe it's an issue that many users actually have (I've seen it happen). Maybe consider taking it off hold?
