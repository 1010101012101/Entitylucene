How to use proxy in terminal <body> Department of Telelcom (India) just blocked some sites in India.  But, only Government-based ISPs block access those sites. Other ISPs still have these sites working. One of those sites is Github and I want to use Github.  How can I apply proxy settings so they work for git sessions to Github in a Terminal?  (Note: I saw this link for doing this in Linux but I guess OS X is little different from Ubuntu?)  <answer165087> From the StackOverflow Q&amp;A entitled "Getting git to work with a proxy server?":     Command to use :  precodegit config --global http.proxy http://proxyuser:proxypwd@proxy.server.com:8080 git config --global https.proxy https://proxyuser:proxypwd@proxy.server.com:8080 /code/pre      ul   lichange proxyuser by your proxy user/li   lichange proxypwd by your prxy password/li   lichange proxy.server.com by proxy server url/li   lichange 8080 by proxy port/li   /ul      If you decide at any time to reset this proxy and work without (no   proxy):      Commands to use:  precodegit config --global --unset http.proxy git config --global --unset https.proxy /code/pre   Git also respects the codehttp_proxy/code and codehttps_proxy/code environment variables.
