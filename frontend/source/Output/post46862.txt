How to Add Gmail Contact via iPhone <body> I have my Gmail account configured via Exchange on my iPhone 4S.  When I add a new contact, it only adds it to my phone.  I have to add separately to Gmail and then merge duplicates, which seems like too many steps.  I want this to work so that any contact I add through iOS is added to my Gmail contacts, not the local phone's contacts.  How can I accomplish this?  <answer46873> In the settings, set your default Contacts account to Gmail.  ol liLaunch strongSettings/strong/li liNavigate to strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong/li liScroll down to strongContacts/strong/li liUnder default account, select the email address you use with Gmail./li /ol  Now whenever you create a contact on iOS, it will be added to Gmail. The only time a contact will not be added to Gmail is if you go into the strongContacts/strong application, select strongGroups/strong on the top, and choose an account other than strongAll Contacts/strong or your Gmail account (e.g. iCloud).
