Spotlight: Unable to index network SMB share <body> I'm trying to turn on spotlight for my NAS drive. I have it mounted in OSX 10.8.2 as the following:   precode /Volumes/Trogdor (smbfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by soltrain) /code/pre  mdutil returns the following:   precodemdutil -as (removed non relevent parts) /Volumes/Trogdor:     Indexing and searching disabled. /code/pre  When I try to enable it I get the following:   precodeNoahs-MacBook-Air:~ soltrain$ mdutil -i on /Volumes/Trogdor/                               /Volumes/Trogdor:                                   Indexing and searching disabled. /code/pre  I've looked for a .metadata_never_index file on /Volumes/Trogdor/ but do not see any such file. I've also added/removed the volume from the privacy preferences in the spotlight pref panel with no effect. Any ideas? I'd rather not use a separate util if spotlight should be working.    <answer73552> You need to manually enable spotlight on smb mounted volumes in Mountain Lion.  Try 'mdutil -as /Volumes/Trogdor' - you should win indexing :)  <answer76533> try codemdutil -i/code on /Volumes/Trogdor  <answer181966> Try going to System Preferences - Spotlight - Privacy, then adding in the share to the list not to index, then removing it again. It helped with a similar issue I had.  <comment85439> Gah. ignore me - sorry! <comment85441> Did you mean to delete this answer entirely or how are we supposed to interpret the comment? <comment114766> Please see my original question for the result of this command
