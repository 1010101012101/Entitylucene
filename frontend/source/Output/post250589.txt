Scaling when printing from IOS <body> I have a Brother QL-720NW label printer and it works fine when I print to from a Mac, but when I try to print from iOS (either a simulator or an actual phone), it scales the result down to about 75%.  A frustrating thing is that the preview looks fine, until I select a printer, and then it waits a few seconds (presumably, it is consulting the printer itself), then previews the scaled down version.  I don't even have a good idea where to start looking for solution to this issue.  On the Mac, I had to specify a paper-size; on iOS, it seems to be guessing, wrong.  Any ideas?
