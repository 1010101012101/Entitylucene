Button "Use as Defaults" are missing in View Options panel (Mountain Lion) <body> I'm a very new user of Apple and Mac OS - coming straight from Windows so please bear with me if my question is a bit foolished.  I'm looking for a way to set my View Option as a default property applying for all folders on my system. I've google this and every answer I'm getting points that I need to press the button "Use as Defaults" in the View Options windows.  Unfortuneately and strangely I do not have that button. I press CMD+J and I've the option to set all my View properties but no button.  I've attached a screenshot of my View Option panel and hopefully it shows it correctly, I couldn't quite figure how to make a screenshot either :-)  Cheers  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/27RMD.png" alt="View Options Panel"  <answer89527> Here is the simple reason:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tzS5D.png" alt="enter image description here"  You are in this view and it does not have the Default, it is already default.  Switch to list view to set the defaults for it.  <comment105090> Screenshot is cmd+shift+4  (that will give you a cursor to select the area) <comment105091> View Options is Only in Finder! <comment105112> Ah that's annoying.. I really like the column view setting but want it to filter and sort it first by kind and then by name but I guess I would have to set this manually for each new folder I'm in.. But thank you so much for your answer :-) <comment105115> @Mestika, you can still sort them by your desire using the ACTION.
