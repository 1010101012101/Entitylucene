OSX 10.9 Mavericks Update Causes Non-Stop Kernel Panics <body> I have a 2009 iMac that I just upgraded to 10.9 OSX Mavericks and after migrating my old software over, my computer is having random kernel panics within 5 minutes of being booted up.  Can anyone find any clues in the panic log below?  precodeTue Oct 29 18:56:03 2013 panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff80066ddd0f): "tcp_lock: so=0xffffff801355b7e8 NO PCB! lr=0xffffff800682fecf lrh=

Apple Inc., 22.1 /code/pre  strongUPDATE:/strong  Just a quick update for anyone else who has this problem.  The iMac was taken to the Apple store where they misdiagnosed the problem as a hard drive issue.  After the hard drive was replaced, when I got home, the machine continued to crash just as it had before.  I'm now going back to the Apple store.  strongPROBLEM SOLVED:/strong  It was simply some 3rd party software that was conflicting with OSX Mavericks, even though my mac was still crashing in Safe Mode.  See the answer below for more information.  Since the Mac still crashed in Safe Mode, within seconds of it starting up, I was unable to uninstall the 3rd party software.  So, I had to take the machine to the Apple store, where they used some special equipment to keep it the Mac alive while they uninstalled the software, and it worked!!!  <answer107569> First, try starting the machine in Safe Mode to re-confirm that this is a third party software issue and not related to hardware:     ol   liShut down your Mac and wait 10 seconds./li   liPress the power button./li   liImmediately after you hear the startup tone, hold down the Shift key.br   You should press the Shift key as soon as possible after you hear the startup tone, but not before./li   liRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple logo and progress indicator (spinning gear)./li   /ol      To leave safe mode, restart the computer normally without holding down any keys during startup.   If it works fine in Safe Mode without issues, then you could try uninstalling some potential culprits seen in the log. The backtrace in your log shows the application firewall crashing. The key suspects in this case, based on what was loaded most recently, are the following:  ol licodecom.speedbit.driver.vadriver 1.0.8/code  ul liUninstall the Speedbit Video Accelerator for Mac from your system and see if it helps./li /ul/li licodecom.seagate.driver.PowSecLeafDriver_10_5    5.2.3 and com.seagate.driver.PowSecDriverCore 5.2.3/code  ul liUninstall any Seagate Diagnostics Tool that you may have and see if it helps./li /ul/li /ol  <answer107722> This is hardly a hard disk issue; From the kernel panic, it seems the TCP stack is to blame, with no packet control block. The suspect is the firewall module, so what you might want to do is tell the Apple Store folk to disable the built in firewall NKE (Network Kernel Extension)  <answer107870> I had a similar issue, however I could boot in to safe mode and nothing crashed. However, if I'm not in safe mode crashing in 5 minutes.  This would happen even on the login screen if I waited for 5 minutes. This was before any user was logged.  I took my Mac Mini to the Apple Store and they were stumped. They showed me how to roll back to 10.8 via Time Machine and it's stable.  I've been uninstalling software, upgrading apps, and running any disk optimization tools.   I haven't tried to re-install Mavericks yet to see if anything has changed but I'm not hopeful.  <answer117528> com.seagate.driver.PowSecLeafDriver_10_5    5.2.3 com.speedbit.driver.vadriver    1.0.8 com.seagate.driver.PowSecDriverCore 5.2.3  these appear to be the problem. find out what they are and uninstall.  <answer121576> I think it is the MAC Family Tree 7.0.3 which is causing the problem.  <answer181724> I had the same problem after installing this Video Accelerator App (which is more of a malware to me) and solved it following these steps:  ol liReboot your computer, click on the icon of VA on the menu bar and select: Video Accelerator off./li liOpen Terminal, run codesu/code and type your root password./li liRun codecd /System/Library/Extensions/code, then coderm -rf VADriver.kext/code/li liReboot your computer and use the App uninstaller to remove it from your Mac completely./li /ol  <comment126199> Thanks, but I have been unable to try your solutions due to the machine crashing immediately when in Safe Mode. <comment126206> One possibility, if OS X Mavericks is excluded as the cause temporarily, is that it's due to some hardware issue. You could run Apple Hardware Test to narrow down to hardware or OS as the cause of the issue. https://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509 <comment126207> Another thing you could try is to restore the system back to OS X Mountain Lion (if you have a `Time Machine` backup or a clone before the OS X Mavericks upgrade). That would also help a bit in isolating hardware or software as the root cause of the issue. <comment126219> Thank you MK.  It's going to the Apple store today and they should go through all of this.  Thanks again. <comment126435> MK, what you described was correct.  The computer went to the Apple store again, they were able to remove the software and everything now works as it should. Thank you! <comment126443> I'm glad it was useful and that you were able to get past this problem (I'm sure it would've been a big annoyance). <comment126683> I have exactly the same problem, I tried everything and I feel hopeless right now. I think the only working solution is to go back to Mountain Lion. Mavericks seems to have many issues. <comment126685> @KamilBoberek Repeatable kernel panics on the order of evert 5 to 10 minutes are pretty trivial for engineering to fix. You are certainly entitles to decline to troubleshoot any problem and revert to the previous OS, but the hard kernel panics to diagnose and remedy are the ones that happen two or three times in 3 months and depend on tricky interactions and odd timing issues. <comment137332> Interesting. Would you explain in broad terms how you rolled back from 10.9 to 10.8? <comment137374> If you're using Time Machine, you just boot up with Time Machine, choose a backup from 10.8, and restore. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1427
