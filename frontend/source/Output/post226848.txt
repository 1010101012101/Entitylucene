How do I get my iPhone backups open <body> I'm trying to extract my old iPhone's backups. I'm using the iPhone Backup Extractor, and it tells me the status of my backup is "complete and encrypted". I don't recall ever encrypting my backup so I'm wondering how is this even possible?   Does the iTunes encrypt your backup without your command?  Is there a way to unencrypt the backup?  Is there any other way of extracting your backup into actual files besides iPhone Backup Extractor? Any recommendations?  <answer226878> Itunes will encrypt your backup by defualt however you can turn this off (its in the options when the device is connected)  There is a program called iExplorer which will allow you to view the contents of your backups and allow to export the data.
