Windows / Linux VNC to Mac OS X not clear <body> I can successfully connect via VNC from my Windows and Linux machine to my Mac OS X.   However on connection, the client view shows very large windows and they are all transparent. I can move the cursor around but its not useful at all in terms of what i can see in the client.   Are there any particular settings i have to change on the client or server?  Im using Vineserver on my mac.  I have tried using RealVNC, TighVNC, UltraVNC on for the client on Windows and Linux.   Mac to Mac works perfect and is very clear. But using windows or linxux OS is not working as expected  <comment133484> may i ask you why you don't just use the os x built in vnc server? <comment133485> have a look here: http://www.davidtheexpert.com/post.php?id=5
