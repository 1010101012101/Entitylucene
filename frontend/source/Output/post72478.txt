Control Music From Notifcations Bar <body> Using iOS6 is there a way to show or display music controls inside the notifications bar for quick access?   Note: I am looking for a native way to do this. If there is not a way I would welcome 3rd party apps that do this function, however, I prefer the standard music player and do not want to change the music player.   <answer72479> There is no way to do this natively. There may be a third party app, but I don't know about it. You will probably need to jailbreak to achieve this functionality.  <answer72480> Unfortunately, there is no built in way to do this with iOS 6 (or lower).  There are other ways to control music playback that may function as a work around for you.   ol liIf the device is unlocked, double tap the home button and swipe the row of apps emfrom/em left to right. This will display Play/Pause controls. Swipe one more time - on an iPhone or iPod Touch - for volume control./li liIf the device is locked, double tap the home button. This will display music controls./li /ol  <comment84175> I was aware of the lock screen controls. I was not aware of the first. Thanks!
