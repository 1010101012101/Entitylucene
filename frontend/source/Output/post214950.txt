Certificate Assistant 5.0 CSR Error <body> I am trying to create a certificate for someone else with a CA I created in Certificate Assistant. However, certificate assistant will no open the CSR generated by the user. I receive the following: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k4Qsl.png" alt="Error"  Thoughts?  <comment277551> How did the user generate the CSR? Also if you look in Console.app do you see any log messages from Certificate Assistant?
