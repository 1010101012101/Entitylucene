NoSleep still in in settings though uninstalled? <body> I have still the NoSleep options in my settings panel although it's fully uninstalled. How can I remove them, too? System is 10.9.  <answer106960> Try right clicking the NoSleep options button from the main screen of System Preferences and click the "Remove Preference Pane" option.  <comment125537> Good to know this works, thank you!! :)
