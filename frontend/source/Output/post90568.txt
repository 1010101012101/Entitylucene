Is there a way to make some application have different resolution on a Retina Macbook Pro? <body> I use "Best for Retina display" in my settings. It's suitable for my eyes:)  But I'd like to get more spaces in some applications by using the highest resolution. So is there a way to do so?  <answer123766> The OS doesn't have any sort of procedure to tell app A to use one screen size and app B another.  Unless the apps you use have a preference to change layout, icon size or other aspects of layout and zoom (like a spreadsheet tool can zoom in and out regardless of the overall resolution), you'll have to pick the best resolution and then change it up as needed based on your workflow.  <comment106309> As in have different applications running at different resolutions at the same time? <comment106310> @Pena Yes, that's it! Do you have any idea? <comment106311> No, so far as I know, you can't do that.
