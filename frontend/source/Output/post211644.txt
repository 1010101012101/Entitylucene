GNU emacs: emacsclient fails with EOPNOTSUPP <body> Brand new MacBook Pro 15" Retina, running OS X Yosemite v10.10.5. I installed GNU Emacs version 24.5-1 from http://emacsformacosx.com/  I run strongM-x server-start/strong from my .emacs, but emacsclient fails, saying "emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?"  So I try to find where the server socket has been created, using stronglsof -c Emacs | grep server/strong and find it in this strange place: /var/folders/p8/d3f05qgn5zlddp_q3gqnh5tr0000gn/T/emacs501/server  So I run strongemacsclient --server-file /var/folders/p8/d3f05qgn5zlddp_q3gqnh5tr0000gn/T/emacs501/server/strong but this also fails, differently, simply saying "error accessing server file "/var/folders/p8/d3f05qgn5zlddp_q3gqnh5tr0000gn/T/emacs501/server"". Running this under strongdtruss/strong shows that the failing system call is strongopen_nocancel()/strong, and that it's failing with error 102, which is EOPNOTSUPP (I assume "operation not supported").  Does anyone know what can done to fix this
