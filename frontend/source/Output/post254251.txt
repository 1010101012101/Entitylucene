How do I force send a text message in iOS 10? <body> When I'm out of the country and don't have wifi or data and I want to send a text message to another iPhone back in the UK, it won't let me send a standard text message . It wants me to send an iMessage as it recognises I'm sending to another iPhone , but I do not have any data allowance or wifi so it won't let me send an iMessage anyway and I can't find a way for forcing it to send a text SMS message.   I've looked in settings and turned off my iMessage, and the option to send text SMS only is not there anymore. I used to be able to do this before iOS 10.  Is there a way I can send a standard text?   <answer255779> A message from Apple Support Chat:      I checked with a few resources on this and it seems that the feature   is no longer available in iOS 10 to be able to chose how to send a   message. We would still have the option to turn on Send as SMS which   will automatically send a message that wasnâ€™t able to be delivered as   an iMessage before.   <answer256033> You can, press and hold the unsent iMessage and a menu will pop up with the option  <answer256035> You can go in codeSettings &gt; Messages &gt; Send as SMS/code  <answer256171> Go to settings and turn off iMessage. Send your message. (Optional) go back to settings and turn iMessage back on.  I just verified that this works in iOS 10.  <answer256564> It's still possible, but You have to send message to phone number instead apple ID (like email address). After enabling codeSend as SMS/code in codeSettings &gt; Messages/code of course. It works exactly how it used to work in iOS 9, but crucial is sending message to phone number.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZU4J.jpg" alt="Photo attached below"  <answer256573> If you turn off iMessage off on Preferences  Messages, all messages come out as Text Messages; that is why the "Send as SMS" option is no longer present.  <comment319106> No, it doesn't work like that in iOS 10. <comment319114> That will only send as SMS if iMessage is not available.  If iMessage is available it will not send as SMS so there's no way to 'force SMS' anymore. <comment327548> This did not work for me with iOS 10.1.1. It recognized the phone number and sent a blue iMessage. <comment332127> @MichaelTsai until the message is delivered You still can press and hold on message and send it as text message. Just checked it and it works. <comment332204> Thanks, but the issue for me is that messages that it says are delivered are not. So I need to resend messages that it thinks were delivered as SMS.
