Switch between full-screen windows of the same application in Lion <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut in Lion for navigating through my open full screen Xcode projects? âŒ˜~ is not working.  <answer20903> You can switch between spaces using ctrl + left right arrow keys, but this can be used with all spaces not just Xcode  <answer20905> You an also use Ctrl+Number to switch to a numbered desktop.  However, full-screen apps are not given a number and so can't directly be used with this technique.  However, if you like the approach, you could manually resize XCode to fill a desktop without actually using full-screen,  <answer151090> This is not the perfect solution as its a paid one, but this software called Which fills this gap. As this is truly a bothersome problem (I often use five or six RDP connections at one time in full screen) I thought I would mention it.  disclaimer : I am not affiliated to this program.  <answer197849> I can switch between windows of the same program by dragging four fingers left or right across the trackpad.  This is analogous to pressing [Command] + [~] when the windows are not in fullscreen.  You can find this setting under System PreferencesTrackpadMore Gestures.  <answer207446> You can also do the swipe two fingers left/right mouse gesture to change between full-screen windows of the same application. See SettingsMouseMore Gestures  <answer255135> h2BEST SOLUTION, but NOT NATIVE:/h2  strongWitch for Mac/strong  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/witch/id412485838?mt=12/li lihttps://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/17185/witch/li /ul  it will do exactly this and let you customize exactly which shortcuts keys to switch between any windows of same app, just those in foreground, just those minimized, or many other combinations of those and much more functionality:   <answer273941> my 'toolbox' for these problems are:  ul liUse maximize instead of fullscreen (alt+click_on_green_icon) so I can use ctrl+1/2/3/4 and/li liDouble-tab with two fingers in the dock to get app-expose./li liuse mission control or four-finger-swipe or ctrl+left/right/li lithe app hyperswitch so cmd-tab AND alt+tab or cmd+^/~ is usable again./li lithe app hyperdock/li lihardly using but also helping: the app ubar (not so sweet) or witch, already named./li /ul  <comment23005> Yeah, "cmd" + "~" doesn't switch between Spaces in Lion. It only switches between windows on a particular space. I wonder if it's a bug in Lion, or purposely designed that way. <comment23086> Indeed "ctrl" + "left right arrow" or "ctrl" + "number", are very useful in order to navigate through spaces, but what I'm missing is a shortcut imitating the "cmd" + "~" in full-screen open windows of the same app. <comment23172> @PaulEccles Both *Move focus to next window (in application)* and *Move focus to active or next window* behaved the same way in Snow Leopard. <comment69923> @PaulEccles IMO this is a bug (anything that doesn't behave as expected is a bug).  cmd-~ moves focus between windows of the same application.  It should obviously do this regardless of whether or not the windows are fullscreen. <comment124902> Is there anything in Mavericks to solve this problem? <comment177779> see [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/151090/13303) for a (paid) solution. No affiliation on my part. A shame Apple still hasn't fixed this. <comment209307> It only seems to work if you have multiple application windows within the same space. For example, if I run Matlab, and run the 'plot' command to bring up a graph, I can toggle between the graph and the editor while the editor is in full screen mode. <comment292282> Seems to require three fingers rather than two. <comment305826> This is the only answer that actually allows switching between multiple full screen instances of the same application that I have found.  Works nicely and allows staying full screen. <comment344369> Not 100% sure if this answers the question.
