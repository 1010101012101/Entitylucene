Unhide desktop icons <body> I recently had tried to make some hidden desktop icons on my desktop following the instructions found here. I am on Mac OS X Mountain Lion. I ended up somehow making every file a hidden file. The files are all visible but are just transparent and I cannot open some of them.   How do I make all of these files become unhidden files so they are no longer transparent and I can access them better?   <answer99448> You might have accidentally show the hidden files in Finder. Try this command to hide all the hidden files:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool NO /code/pre  To show it again, change the BOOL value from NO to YES:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES /code/pre  <comment116947> What exactly did you do to hide them? <comment116959> I followed this tutorial. I am not sure what went wrong. http://osxdaily.com/2009/09/23/hide-all-desktop-icons-in-mac-os-x/ <comment116967> Have you tried undoing what you did? If you ran that first command in the link, have you tried running `TRUE` instead of `FALSE` like in the link? <comment116970> +1 to the above comment.  "defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true" will remediate your issue. <comment116984> Yes I have tried that, but for some reason all of the icons are still transparent and being shown as hidden files. <comment117003> Can you posted a screenshot of what it looks like? Are the files that are showing up as transparent icons your actual files that were there before you ran the CreateDesktop defaults command?
