Free Excel alternative for Mac OS? <body> I need free alternative of Excel in Mac Os. I know that there is Open Office, but I am not sure if it is even supported anymore.  Any ideas?  <answer277948> Excel is available for free from Microsoft as part of an entire suite of products via Office Online.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CS4s7.png" alt="enter image description here"  There's no need to search for a "free" Office alternative when Office is available free as a service.  You will just need to create a Microsoft account to use it.  strongThe benefits over the alternatives:/strong  ul liNo software to install (i.e. LibreOffice/Open Office).  All you need is a web browser./li liNative Excel as opposed to "XLS compatible" (which is never really fully compatible)/li liFree 5GB OneDrive storage included with your account/li liFairly standardized UI across all devices (macOS, iOS, Windows, Android)/li /ul  <answer277949> I use LibreOffice which is a really good alternative for MS Office. I've been using it for a couple of years now (on my Ubuntu earlier, now on MacOS).  If you need an online version of Office I recommend GoogleDocs. Full document edit history, collaborative editing, and ease of sharing.  <answer277989> By adding a table to Numbers, you can use Apple's replacement instead of a third party's. Numbers is free* and preinstalled on your Mac, and it's designed to replace Excel for Mac users.  sub* on the Mac App Store for qualifying Mac computers purchased on or after October 1, 2013. macOS Sierra required /sub  <comment349779> As I remember there is monthly fee, which is not exactly "free", @Allan? <comment349780> You are thinking of their subscription package.  They offer a free online version that doesn't have all the bells and whistles the paid version does. <comment349781> So if you want an online version just use GoogleDocs :) <comment349782> @bartektartanus - Why when Office is available for free and more prevalent? <comment349784> LibreOffice is at best a mediocre alternative to MS Office.  When management wanted to explore open office one of the biggest points of pain was OO/LO compatibility with MS Office formats.  Second was OO/LO  UI compatibility/familiarity.  I wouldn't recommend that product to anyone with an active internet connection <comment349786> What exactly do you need in Excel - some parts are not available in other tools? <comment349787> I need viewing and simple editing - nothing fancy, @Mark <comment349793> Because prevalent doesn't mean good. Like with any invasive technology, when competition is killed natural selection stops working, and quality fall down. <comment349794> I use LibreOffice in a context where the there are problems of compatibility between different versions of Microsoft Office and with LibreOffice. The use of LibreOffice permit me help my colleagues with different versions of Microsoft Office to get a version wich everyone was able to read. LibreOffice worked as a "greatest common denominator" between different versions of Microsoft Office. <comment349795> Did you try Numbers? <comment349820> No, I installed LibreOffice, but I want to check free MS Office (no time now), @danielAzuelos <comment349830> @danielAzuelos - Neither does "free" and Libre Office is utter bloatware compared to O365.  How can something be considered invasive when people *choose* to purchase it?  Could it be that with Libre Office, you get exactly what you pay for?
