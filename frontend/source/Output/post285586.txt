Copying text in vim to the global clipboard <body> On my linux computer I am able to copy text to the clipboard with the command code"+y/code. How do I do the same on Mac?  <answer285601> macOS version of strongvim/strong is compiled with code-clipboard/code (you can check with codevim --version/code). So there's no shared clipboard available. In this case you can download/recompile new strongvim/strong or you can use system command codepbcopy/code (man page). Here's how to use it as kbdCTRL âŒƒ/kbd+kbdC/kbd shortcut:  codemap &lt;C-c&gt; y:e ~/clipsongzboard&lt;CR&gt;P:w !pbcopy&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;:bdelete!&lt;CR&gt;/code  Add this to your code~/.vimrc/code file.  Explanation of this command can be found here: vimtips @ quora  <answer285603> Additionally you can install the program MacVim, which is a version of Vim 8 compiled for Mac, including a GUI. However you don't need the GUI, you can just link the codemvim/code executable to codevim/code somewhere on your code$PATH/code, and the code+/code register will work as your clipboard just like you are used to.  MacVim is also recommended if you are going to install some recent plugins like YouCompleteMe.
