Share iPhone WIFI with computer over USB? <body> Due to a water leakage, we had to move offices temporarily. In our temp offices, we have WIFI network, but not cabled network (yet).  Since my computer doesn't have WIFI (it's a stationary desktop) I thought I could see if I could bridge my iPhone WIFI connection over to my computer via USB while I wait for local facilities to set up cabled network here.  Is this possible?  <answer31183> which iPhone and iOS versions are you using? you will also need to check that your carrier allows a personal hotspot.  if you are able to turn on a personal hotspot on your phone, just connect the phone to the PC with a USB and enter the Wi-Fi password after finiding teh phone in the network settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fqxoX.png" alt="enter image description here"  You could also just get a WiFi USB which would pick up the WiFi from the router.  <answer31204> Sorry, but it's not possible to do this without jail breaking. The "Personal Hotspot" function on an iPhone only allows for sharing the 3G connection, not the wifi connection, so you can't use it as a wifi adapter. It's feasible that Apple could add this functionality, but it's a fairly niche case, so I wouldn't count on it.  More immediately, if you have a laptop with wifi available, you could use Internet Sharing (OS X)/Internet Connection Sharing (Windows) and an ethernet cable to get connectivity to your desktop. Or if you've got a Staples or something similar nearby, they usually have USB wifi adapters for $30 or less.  <answer39279> Of course this is possible:   ol liYour iOS device must be joined to wifi connection/li liYour iOS device must be jailbroken/li liYour PC must have iTunes on it/li liInstall MyWi 5.0 over Cydia (Cydia will be installed on your iOS device after you jailbreak it)/li liChoose USB tethering in USB tab ul liSet MyWi USB to ON/li liGo to Advanced USB/li liSet USB Bridhe to "Bridged to WiFi" so you don't get online via 3G/li /ul/li liEnjoy your wireless internet connection/li /ol  <answer83171> just download virtualwifirouter for free , install and configure it once ....... and enjoy for life time :) .........   <answer127816> Free method that works, with a jailbroken iPhone at least:  strong1)/strong Install openSSH on your iPhone from cydia, or codeapt-get/code, if you prefer the terminal.  strong2)/strong Install python 2.7.x. br &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of this writing the latest version is 2.7.6.  strong3)/strong download libusbmuxd.br &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libusbmuxdbr &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can either do a codegit clone/code or, if you don't have / want to get codegit/code, downloadbr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the release from the 'releases' tab.  strong4)/strong unpack it if you didn't take the codegit clone/code route. If you downloaded the tarball,do br &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;codetar zxvf &lt;tarball name&gt;.tar.gz/code from a terminal. In windows, use 7-zip or download the .zip version of the tool.  strong5)/strong codecd/code into codelibusbmuxd/python-client/code.  strong6)/strong The following step is platform-dependent:  h2Windows/h2  If you run windows, you will have to manually type the path to your codepython.exe/code program. If you chose the default location, it will install into codeC:\Python27/code. So, in windows, go to your command prompt and type brcodeC:\Python27\python.exe tcprelay.py -t 22:2222/code.  h2Linux/Unix/Solaris/BSD, etc./h2  If you use Linux (like me), Cygwin in Windows, BSD/Unix, solaris, or basically any platform besides windows and DOS known to man,  you will simply type brcodepython2.7 tcprelay.py -t 22:2222/code. br  h2br/h2  strong7)/strong Not quite done yet - You need a SSH client running! This, too, is platform-dependent.  h2Windows - PuTTY/h2  In windows, cygwin makes this easy, but if you don't have cygwin already, PuTTY is a good option: brhttp://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html brSet it up like this:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OCYY1.png" alt="Setting up puTTY - 1" br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yNvZo.png" alt="Setting up puTTY - 2"  Be sure to set the login username to 'mobile'. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xUtNG.png" alt="Setting up puTTY - 3"  And, for a little extra speed (lower overhead from the encryption), change the encryption to 'arcfour'. Usually, I would emnot/em recommend this, but since you are pushing the encryption over a USB cable and not a network, security is less of a risk. br  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LYoBG.png" alt="Setting up puTTY - 4"  If you want, you can then save a profile for this, to avoid setting it all back up each time you have a problem. This is done in the 'session' section at the very top.  h2Linux/Unix/BSD/Solaris/OSX/HP-UX/whatever I'm still missing/h2  You can run codessh -D 8080 -p 2222 mobile@127.0.0.1/code The default password for the codemobile/code and coderoot/code accounts on the iphone should be codealpine/code. Once you are successfully logged in, you should see a codexterm/code-like window. type codepasswd/code now, to change your password to something more secure. Also, type codesu/code and use codealpine/code as your password to log in as coderoot/code and change the coderoot/code password as well. Then, type codeexit/code to go back to your login as codemobile/code.  strong8)/strong You're nearly done now, I swear! It's less complex than it appears so far, if you actually do it yourself!  Now, you need to open your web browser of choice; I use firefox, so I will use it as an example. I have used chrome, but as I do not like it and do not currently have it installed, I cannot presently use it for an example. But you set it up as a SOCKS proxy, regardless of browser.  These screenshots were done with a forwarded X11, so the fonts are ugly, but pay it no mind.br First, go to the preferences window (codetools -&gt; options/code or codeedit -&gt; preferences/code, depending on OS). Then, go to codeAdvanced -&gt; Network -&gt; Settings.../code. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h9hrM.png" alt="Firefox Configuration 1"  Use the following configuration for the browser. br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OPuP3.png" alt="Firefox Configuration 2"  h1Problems and Solutions/h1  h2Problem:/h2  Yeah, this isn't really using the iphone as a modem.  h2Solution:/h2  Get over it; it works.  h2Problem:/h2  My app doesn't allow setting a SOCKS proxy.  h2Solution:/h2  I have had this problem with games like Minecraft. Here's some fixes. br For minecraft, I added a argument to codessh/code. I regularly play on the nerd.nu reddit minecraft servers (reddit.com/r/mcpublic). Since minecraft 1.6, SSH tunneling and SOCKS proxies set as command line arguments haven't worked. You used to be able to add java parameters code-DSocksProxyHost=127.0.0.1 -DSocksProxyPort=8080/code and it would work. Now, however, the solution isn't quite as nice, but it does work.  When you start codessh/code, instead of codessh -D 8080 -p 2222 mobile@127.0.0.1/code, dobrcodessh -D 8080 -L 127.0.0.1:25565:p.nerd.nu:25565 -p 2222 mobile@127.0.0.1/code. br Then, when you want to connect to the server, instead add the URL code127.0.0.1:25565/code to your list of servers! The remote server will appear on 127.0.0.1/localhost thanks to the miracle of SSH tunneling!  For other programs/games, the same rule applies. If you can't set a SOCKS proxy and nothing else works, just add code-L 127.0.0.1:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;remote URL to access&gt;:&lt;remote port&gt;/code.  There is nothing forcing you to use the same port on code127.0.0.1/code that you would normally, so I could have, for example, mapped codep.nerd.nu:25565/code to code127.0.0.1:1025/code and the game wouldn't care as long as I specified the port. Not all programs are so lenient, but it's useful to remember.  hr  Also, remember: emNearly any program/em can use this. So while it's not as nice as having a simple modem or something, It definitely works. Note that if you lose connection to wi-fi, you will probably start eating into your cellular network's data access. If the cellular network does deep-level packet inspection, be prepared for a charge for enabling tethering. Just be careful, please :) If you have "TetherMe" from Cydia, or something like that, it might mask what you are doing. Also, sometimes if the iphone goes to sleep it will turn off wi-fi. Install codeinsomnia/code from cydia/apt to get around that.  Or, to prevent deep packet inspection, you can also SSH from your iphone into a PC at home for encryption, and then SSH into your iphone from your device that you are wired into.  <comment35789> Hence why I started with this statement (which iPhone and iOS versions are you using? you will also need to check that your carrier allows a personal hotspot.) <comment35791> I think you're misunderstanding the question - the poster wants a way to use his iPhone to share the wifi connection over USB. The Personal Hotspot can only share the 3G connection. <comment35814> No I'm not. If you read the last part I offer 2 alternatives as you can't do it with the iPhone <comment47926> From the [vendor's site](http://support.intelliborn.com/index.php?option=com_kb&appName=MyWi%205.0): `One great example is your iPhone may have access to a HotSpot for free that also allows tethering.  Thus, you can use your iPhone's WiFi to connect and use the USB connection to allow your internet to pipe/bridge it's traffic through the WiFi connection.` <comment75349> "Not possible" is inexistent - you just might not be good enough to know about a solution. Rope's answer is correct. <comment95862> Could you elaborate a bit on this? It's not really a comment and not enough to stand alone as an answer. <comment149819> Sorry if this is too long; I just feel really, really proud to have finally figured out SSH tunneling so well. It really is THE most useful thing ever. (Just wrote this on my laptop from a car)
