Is it possible to rotate in Preview without advancing to the next page? <body> I have a slight annoyance with rotating pages 180 degrees in Preview. The next page is selected automatically after rotating either left or right (90 degrees).  This behavior adds a step. Is there a way to disable the auto-advance, or perhaps a keyboard command that rotates the page 180 degrees? (I don't want to flip the page vertically.)  <comment214341> What OS, what version Preview? I can't repro your issue. <comment214550> Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.2  Preview Version 8.0 (859.7) <comment214561> 10.10.3 & 8.0 859.21 here - not sure of that's what may make the difference
