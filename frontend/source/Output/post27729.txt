Changing the default screenshot filename <body> Is there a way to change the default screenshot filename prefix (the codeCmd-Shift-4/code type screenshot) to something other than the default? The default name looks like this:  precodeScreen Shot 2011-08-30 at 10.01.36 AM.png /code/pre  But I'd prefer to use something like:  precodescreenshot_2011-08-30_100136.png /code/pre  Basically so I can remove the spaces and junk, since it's annoying to browse dig through files in Terminal. Any easy way to change this prefix with one of the codedefaults write com.apple.screencapture/code style commands?  <answer27731> You can change 'Screen shot' to 'screenshot' with the following commands    codedefaults write com.apple.screencapture name screenshot/codebr codekillall SystemUIServer/code    If you want to go digging a bit deeper in Terminal, you can achieve what you want by doing the following:    emstrongNOTE:/em/strong Make a backup of any files you change in case you make a mistake.    ol licodecd /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/code/li liMake a copy of the existing file:br codesudo cp ScreenCapture.strings ScreenCapture.strings.old/code/li liEnter Admin password if prompted/li liConvert to an editable format:br codesudo plutil -convert xml1 ScreenCapture.strings/code/li licodesudo vi ScreenCapture.strings/code    Locate the following lines:    precode&lt;key&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/string&gt;   /code/pre  and replace with the following lines:    precode&lt;key&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;%@_%@_%@&lt;/string&gt;   /code/pre/li liConvert back to binary:br codesudo plutil -convert binary1 ScreenCapture.strings/code/li licodekillall SystemUIServer/code/li /ol  which combined with the first change should get you something like this:    codescreenshot_2011-08-30_10.01.36.png/code which is very close to what you need I think    <answer27733> Open terminal and enter:  precode$ sudo su  $ cd /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj  $ plutil -convert xml1 ScreenCapture.strings  $ nano ScreenCapture.strings /code/pre  change  precode&lt;key&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;.&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;.&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;Screen Shot&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;Screen Shot&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  to  precode&lt;key&gt;%@ %@ at %@&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;%@_%@_%@&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;.&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;Screen Shot&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;screenshot&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  then  kbdControl/kbd + O to write the file, and kbdControl/kbd + X to exit nano  precode$ plutil -convert binary1 ScreenCapture.strings  $ killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  One more thing to note here is that to get rid of AM/PM you will need to change it in System Preferences  Language &amp; Text  Formats (24 hour format). Time stamps are displayed according to how this is set; keep in mind if you change this setting all filenames will use this format.  ~ Let me know how it works out.  <answer27745> The same effect of the complicated terminal actions shown above can be achieved through the free secrets preference pane, which serves as an interface for all sorts of hidden setting in Mac OS and it's apps. Simply open the pref pane and find the setting u want to change  <answer27755> IMO you should absolutely not muck around with anything in /System/.  For one thing, you are just asking for your customizations to be overwritten by a future update.  Download the demo of Sharpshooter from http://www.kerlmax.com/products/sharpshooter/  You can use it for 30 days. Then buy it for $15. It's a great utility.  Alternatively, have you tried Skitch? It's completely free, and a lot better than the built-in.  <answer88494> I solved this another way. Using Automator I set up a Folder Action to monitor my screen shot folder and rename any new files exactly the way I want them.   There's a decent guide here with a similar approach and instructions.  <answer88571> I have disabled the default shortcuts and assigned a shortcut to this command:  precodescreencapture -i ~/Desktop/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).png /code/pre  -i (interactive) is like ⇧⌘4 or ⌃⇧⌘4.  <answer112747> I liked Adrian B's answer. Here's the shell script I wrote to rename screen cap files: https://gist.github.com/DinoChiesa/7796444  To set it up as a Folder Action, follow this article.    When you get to the Automator window, follow this guide:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N3ecn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Don't forget to save it (Command-S).   It takes 3-6 seconds, in my experience, for that folder action to "kick off" after I capture the screen.    <comment103911> Is there any chance we could get you to select an answer that worked for you? (or an edit to know better what you seek?) <comment132274> What's the latency with the Automator approach?  How long between the time the original screencap is saved, and the file is available with the new filename?  Is it 1 second, 3 seconds, 12 seconds? <comment132276> That seems like the most direct solution to the problem. But how does one map a shortcut to a command? In the System Preferences dialog, it says "enter the exact name of the MENU COMMAND you want to add."  Your command is not a menu command, so...? <comment132286> @Cheeso See the link in the answer. You can use an application like FastScripts or Alfred or create a service with Automator. <comment132292> Between 5 and 7 seconds from screenshot is taken until the file name is changed (on my MacBook Pro from 2009). <comment132351> Thanks! Given that, I'm going to write some bash code to do this. <comment293063> This does not appear to work in OS X El Capitan, presumably due to System Integrity Protection.
