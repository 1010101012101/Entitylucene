How do I create an explicit app ID using Xcode? <body> So far I've been able to create an iOS Team Provisioning profile with codeXcode/code, but it looks like it is only possible to create it using a Wildcard App Id.  Since I need to enable Push Notifications it must be an explicit app Id. I know it is very easy to create using the member center, but my question is:  How do I create it using only codeXCode/code?  <answer222129> You must create an explicit App ID in the Developer Member Center. There is no other option of where to create this.  <comment269081> Why can't you use the Member Center to create an ID? <comment269088> I'm using Delphi 10 Seattle and it only seems to find iOS Team Provisioning Profiles. <comment269089> I'm a bit confused now. How does using Delphi prevent you from using the Dev Member Center?
