Sublime got stuck after project updated from git <body> I'm not really sure how to address such problem, but it seems that right after I've pulled some major update to my project from remote git repository, Sublime was asking to reload the project, and got stuck in this stage forever.. I've tried to debug the problem from xcode (without sublime source code of course), and it looks like all thread are waiting for something which is a typical deadlock scenario (see snapshot).   the real issue here is that the problem is persistent (restart the application wouldn't help).. so perhaps there's a way to remove sublime cache somehow in order to trigger reload project from scratch.   here's the window from which the application was stuck   :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XOrb.png" alt="enter image description here"  and here's the thread state of the application (notice all thread are either waiting for something or stuck in mach msg trap).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QWcZZ.png" alt="enter image description here"
