Configuring custom keys on bluetooth keyboard <body> I have a Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard for Android similar to the one shown here at BestBuy. The one I have is older and isn't printed the same as either model shown on BestBuy's website, but it has the same number of keys in the same place.  Is there anyway I can manually map the bottom row of keys to match certain keys for Apple, such as Fn, Control, Alt/Option and Command? This would be really helpful and would let me share one bluetooth keyboard between my Android tablet and Macbook. I prefer this to a wireless keyboard is it already has a carrying case and is very light weight.  Any help is appreciated!  Mac OS X 10.9  strongEDIT/strong It appears, the closest to mine is now the Windows 8 RT / Android keyboard here, but it still doesn't have the same keyboard layout.   My keyboard has 4 buttons to the left of the space bar and 3 buttons between space and the arrows. So it has the same button positions, just different labels. Here is a pic of the one I'm using. The biggest thing is that mine doesn't have a "CMD" button, I really only need to fix the mapping so that the little search icon will act as the Apple Command button and then I would be good to go. Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKuL6.jpg" alt="my logitech keyboard layout"  ** EDIT TWO ** Using the recommendation found in the accepted answer below, I started playing with the PCKeyboardHack and KeyRemap4MacBook software. I want to add for anyone who comes here looking for an answer to a similar problem, the two pieces of software shown above are both very good and using the instructions in the shown answer, should allow you to map any extra keys found on most keyboards. The problem with the older Logitech Android keyboard is that his software and the Macbook are apparently not recognizing those keys at all.   I appreciate all the help!

Maybe you should tell us exactly what your keyboard has printed in their place. <comment132119> @TomG They've replaced mine at this point, so I posted an actual picture of what I'm using. Any chance you could tell me how to map that search icon button to a command button on an Apple keyboard? <comment132124> I've marked this as the accepted answer, as I feel it answers the core problem even though my given keyboard fails to be sending in commands when pressing the search, home, back and menu keys. <comment132744> @Kyle Check if you have *Don't remap external keyboards* checked in preferences, and make sure you don't have any other driver software installed for the device.
