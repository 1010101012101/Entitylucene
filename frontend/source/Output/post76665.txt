iTerm2 save window/tabs on exit? <body> I tried to save a window arrangement but when I open iTerm it opens two windows:  ol lione with my saved arrangement/li lione with no arrangements/li /ol  How can I make iTerm2 remember my Window/tabs layout?  <answer81275> First create some profiles and then use Command - Option/Alt - Shift H (H is for horizontal split; or swap in V for vertical split). It will show you a list of your profiles and you can then add those to your split. This short video shows how: iterm2 Profiles and Window Arrangements.  <answer185979> This was answered on superuser by another user and the solution worked for me.  Turn off prefsgeneralopen default window arrangement, and turn off system prefsgeneralclose windows when quitting an application.  <comment94871> Thanks for the Video I learnt some new tricks. But my problem is when I quit iTerm2 & open it back. it doesn't save the last state it was on, even with window arrangements.
