Hostname changed after setting up virtual host in MAMP <body> I have MAMP Pro installed and recently configured a local virtual host called: codetest.local/code.  Now my OSX terminal prompt says  codetest:~ username$/code  I just noticed also when an email bounced back the raw header also shows test.local:  codeReceived: from cpe-111-111-111-111.lns1.lon.somehost.com ([222.222.222.2222]:22222 helo=testhost.local)/code  I've tried running...  codescutil --set LocalHostName properHostName/code  â€¦but it hasn't had an effect.  Also, if I do override it to the original proper hostname, will there be negative side effects?  <answer123311> Doing this fixed it:  codesudo hostname properhostname.local/code  And I haven't noticed any side-effects yet.  I can still access the virtual host using codetesthost.local/code.  Works after a MAMP restart also.  <comment143979> I guess you anonymized the `222.222.222.222`-IP above, but for documentation purpose: It is not a good idea not to use RFC 1918 addresses for local setups. Additionally next time questions like this might be more suitable for Server Fault.
