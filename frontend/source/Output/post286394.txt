Proper way to use stty on a Mac <body> I'd like to send some raw binary data out a serial device on my Mac (it's a Bluetooth HAM Radio TNC which exposes a serial interface). I'd like to send this data:  precodeC0 00 54 45 53 54 C0 /code/pre  This is the command I've tried:  precodeecho -en '\xC0\x00\x54\x45\x53\x54\xC0' &gt; stty -f /dev/tty.MobilinkdTNC2-DevB speed 38400 cs8 -cstopb -echo /code/pre  Where codetty.MobilinkdTNC2-DevB/code is my Bluetooth serial device and the connection parameters are 38400 baud 8N1. I'm redirecting the output of codeecho/code into codestty/code because I've read that macOS will close the serial connection if you do it in two separate steps (as is common on Linux).  Is this the proper way to use codestty/code on a Mac?
