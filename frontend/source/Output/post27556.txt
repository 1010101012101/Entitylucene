How can I change Finder's default sort to filename? <body> Since I updated to Lion, every time I bring up a new Finder window the default sort order is by modification date. I want the default sort by filename. Is there any way to change this?  <answer27656> Open the finder window and hit cmd+j.  Select the settings you want and then at the bottom hit Use As Defaults.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kY5gd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment31637> Have you tried removing `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist`? New windows should just be sorted by the same attribute as previous windows. <comment31805> Strangely, that doesn't do it. It seems that many folders (Downloads, Documents, etc) have by time as an override. But thanks. <comment31908> I'll give that a try. THanks. <comment31933> This is one thing I don't like about OSX, by setting it as default it looks like it only effects the current folder. The folder in which you set it will from now on open in that way, but the others are untouched. You could potentially copy the .DS_Store file from that folder to all other folders. DS_Store is what saves the display information.
