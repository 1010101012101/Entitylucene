Quick-insert a random selected word from a big list of words with a simple key combination? <body> Anyone knows how to quick-insert a random selected word from a big list of words with a simple key combination with Mac OSX?  Example: When I press "ctrl + alt + cmd + V" the computer randomly picks one of the words from a list, and 'types' it into the place where I was typing already, for example in the search-bar of my browser.
