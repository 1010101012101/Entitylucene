Iphone 5 low battery settings with wifi <body> Are there any special Iphone 5 low battery settings with wifi? Today I was using my iphone and the wifi magically turned off by itself. I figured it was just having trouble finding the wifi so I went to my settings to see what was going on. Somehow it turned itself off. I'm guessing this is because I had a low battery. I just got the battery message saying my phone had reached 20% battery a few minutes before that happened. Has this ever happened to anyone before?   <comment157813> and you DO NOT have the BatterySafe installed ? <comment157910> @Buscarì›ƒ No, I do not. I never even heard of that until you just mentioned it.
