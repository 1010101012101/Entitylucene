Deleted 20GB using 'rm -rf <dir>' and 'df -k' has not changed (but 'du -k' is correct) <body> I was cleaning up old directories on my 256GB  MBPro SSD mounted on /dev/disk1.  At first   precode df -k /code/pre  was showing the expected increased  in available disk space on that Filesystem. However for the last half dozen invocations of "rm -rf  0.1%) change. In fact the entire available disk space slightly emdecreased/em.    There is no other substantial work happening on the system - and the Virtual Memory size has not changed.  Now double digit GB of data is quite sizeable. I can not understand how "df -k" could miss / neglect these changes.  Note: I did confirm that the directories being removed by rm -rf are in fact gone. In any case it took minutes to perform those deletions - so it was obvious things were happening.  Here is output embefore/em all the "rm-rf"'s:  precode20:17:50/shared $df -k Filesystem                        1024-blocks      Used Available Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1                          243915264 217388008  26271256    90% 54411000 6567814   89%   / devfs                                     200       200         0   100%      694       0  100%   /dev map -hosts                                  0         0         0   100%        0       0  100%   /net map auto_home                               0         0         0   100%        0       0  100%   /home localhost:/5Lcoijnnqm-dLj_GeL3j-A   243915264 243915264         0   100%        0       0  100%   /Volumes/MobileBackups /code/pre  Here is the output emafter/em all the "rm -rf"'s  precode20:27:28/shared $df -k Filesystem                        1024-blocks      Used Available Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1                          243915264 217450876  26208388    90% 54426717 6552097   89%   / devfs                                     200       200         0   100%      694       0  100%   /dev map -hosts                                  0         0         0   100%        0       0  100%   /net map auto_home                               0         0         0   100%        0       0  100%   /home localhost:/5Lcoijnnqm-dLj_GeL3j-A   243915264 243915264         0   100%        0       0  100%   /Volumes/MobileBackups /code/pre  Here is the strongdu/strong of the parent directory of the ones being deleted embefore/em the rm's.  precodedu -d 2 -k &gt; out  Last line of out: 58446128  . /code/pre  So we had 58GB under that parent dir  Here is the du on the parent dir emafter/em the rm's:  precodedu -d 2 -k &gt; out  Last line of out2: 36830744 . /code/pre  So: strongdu is working/strong - showing 20GB less. But strongdf is broken/strong  But what does strongFinder/strong say?   strongFinder agrees with df !/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ft3V.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  BTW here is "Trash": shows it has been emptied so that is not the issue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6Udt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So then - why are the directories removed by rm -rf not being made available back to the O/S?  strongUPdate/strong  I have removed emanother 20GB/em for a total of strong50GB/strong  yet still the same amount of disk space is reflected in both finder and df -k.  ** Another update ** It appears that   precodesudo tmutil disablelocal /code/pre  may have resolved this. Apparently time machine does local backups: and the deleted files do not emreally/em get removed until/unless it (lazily) decides to allow it.  Notice it is now strong62GB/strong free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RSSpT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment232019> Local snapshots are a useful feature, and you shouldn't disable them unless they're causing an actual problem. The fact that deleting files doesn't immediately free up disk space may be confusing, but as long as you understand what's going on (and realize that the space will automatically be released if/when it's needed for new files), this shouldn't be considered a problem. <comment232022> @GordonDavisson  I have been running into disk space issues - so whatever algorithm being used it is not serving the purpose sufficiently  - i.e. the space from the deleted files is not  being made available in the "just in time" manner advertised.. I do need to disable the local backups.  I will consider re-enabling in the future.
