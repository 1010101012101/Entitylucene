After update, background turned black, the dock is missing <body> As you can see it, after updating the commandline tools for xcode, the background turned black and the dock is missing  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mKEYR.png" alt="enter image description here"  the OS is macOS Sierra 10.12.4(16E195)  How can I fix it?  <answer277737> On rare occasions, I have had to go nuclear and clean out specific preference files:  coderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code  One might argue that you should back it up first. In that light, I suggest simply moving it out of the way and force-quitting Finder.  codecd ~/Library/Preferences mv com.apple.finder.plist com.apple.finder.plist-orig/code  <comment349532> Just checking, have you restarted your Mac? If not, what have you tried (if anything)? <comment349534> @Monomeeth, I have restarted my mac for many times, still doesn't work. <comment349538> it doesn't work. <comment349602> Does Command-Option-D bring the Dock back?  Can you change the Dock and Desktop/Screensaver settings in System Preferences? <comment349687> command-option-d can't bring the dock back, and I can't even change the background picture. And there is a ReportCrash process running on the os. <comment349849> Can you log in as a different user?  If one doesn't exist, create a new one and log in on that account.  If it comes up happy, then there's something else wrong with your user account and you may need to delete it and recreate it. <comment349902> It is the same case in the guest user account. <comment350042> Try reinstalling Xcode.  If that doesn't work, try reinstalling Sierra from Recovery mode to help clean things up.  It shouldn't overwrite user files, just system files (that at this point appear to be corrupt).
