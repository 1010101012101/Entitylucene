Can you control brightness on two monitors simultaneously via the brightness key? <body> I have two Thunderbolt monitors daisy chained together and when I press down on the brightness key (kbdF1/kbd/kbdF2/kbd) it only dims the brightness / ups it only on one monitor. Is there a way so that when the brightness hotkey is pressed it can control both the monitors without having to open settings to control the other monitor?  Thanks.  <answer110397> This will not allow you to change them simultaneously but you can use  ul likbdF1/kbd or kbdF2/kbd for the main display and/li likbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF1/kbd or kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF2/kbd for the secondary display/li /ul  As an addition you can also modify the brightness in smaller steps (1/4) by pressing kbdoption/kbd+kbdshift/kbd with both combinations.  <comment129907> It's not a solution, but instead of opening the panel you can use control + F1/F2 to adjust the brightness on the secondary monitor. <comment129946> Take a look in Better Touch Tool. I remember that somewhere there was an option to create shortcuts to change brightness on external monitors. This may work also with multiple monitors in one command, if setup properly... <comment129967> @Matteo Thanks! I didn't know you could do that. This is suffice solution! :D <comment130039> @Monstr92 OK I posted it as an answer
