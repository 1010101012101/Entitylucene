Prevent VPN Disconnection message OSX <body> When my computer wakes from sleep, it tries to reconnect to my VPN network before the Wifi connection is fully established. The result is that nearly every time I get this message, "You were disconnected because the PPP server is not responding. Try reconnecting."
