How delete remaining photos AFTER reset from Photo Stream on icloud and on iPhone? <body> After having reset Photo Stream on icloud.com and turned off Photo Stream in the pref. on my iPhone, deleting all photos, I still got a total of 423MB worth of images on my iPhone.   According to the usage data I've got: 0 bytes - Camera roll, 42,3MB - Photo library, 381MB - Photo Stream.  I have deleted all photos in the camera app. No photos, videos, no nothing. Likewise, opening the Photos app, no images are available. Still I am supposed to have those 423MB of photos somewhere. I have rebooted the phone with no improvement.   Where are the photos and how do I kill them?! They are haunting me!
