iPhone Proxy auto-configuration with username / password <body> I'm looking for a way to include the username and password to an auto configurated setting for proxies on iOS. Any ideas?  <answer52380> HTTP GET logins have you include your username and password in the URL. For example, if you're using the fictional proxy that's located at codewww.an-example-proxy.com/proxy-login/code, and you were instructed to use port code3333/code, and your username is codefoo/code, and your password is codebar/code, then you would put codehttp://foo:bar@www.an-example-proxy.com:3333/proxy-login/code in the codeURL/code field on the codeAuto/code tab under codeSettings &gt; WiFi &gt; ESSID (Network Name) &gt; HTTP Proxy/code (this doesn't sound too much like an automatically configured proxy to me, though, but this should get you logged on).
