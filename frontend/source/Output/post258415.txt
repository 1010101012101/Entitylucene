How do I open an application and get it to log in using AppleScript? <body> This is what I have so far:   precodetell application "OSBuddy"     activate end tell /code/pre  Picture of what opens up at this point:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ddBgG.png" alt="enter image description here"  precoderepeat 4 times     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "tab" end repeat  tell application "System Events"     key code 36 end tell /code/pre  When I hit tab four times and then enter, it opens up the login page:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ppy00.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke "[MY LOGIN]"     key code 36     keystroke "[MY PASSWORD]" end tell /code/pre  The problem is, it doesn't hit tab four times and then enter. It just opens to the first picture I showed, does not go any further. I know my code is correct, I have no idea why it isn't working.  <comment323049> Maybe try adding a delay between tabs, like this: delay 3
