iCal loads, but quits after a few seconds <body> I added a calendar from my Google account in Ical and now it quit about 3 seconds after loading.  I have tried the solution described here:  https://discussions.apple.com/message/3680441#3680441br but I don't even have codeuser's Library &gt; Application Support &gt; iCal/code  OS X 10.6.7  <answer16316> You could try the same solution in the post you linked, but the calendars are stored in a different location (and format) in Snow Leopard. The calendars are stored as sub-folders of code~/Library/Calendars/code in Snow Leopard.  If you have multiple calendars, you can check the date each folder was created to see which one would be the Google calendar.  <comment17810> Just to clarify, are you literally trying to find a folder named `user's library`? <comment17811> XD no.. `~/Library/Application\ Support/iCal` doesn't exist. <comment17812> I figured that was what you meant, but I just wanted to be sure. I actually don't have that folder either. It looks like that discussion was about Tiger, not Snow Leopard. <comment17813> I have also just tried to close iCal, moved `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist` and `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.helper.plist` to the Desktop and still no luck. <comment17814> Luckily, I didn't have any data stored locally so I just removed all contents in that folder. Thanks!
