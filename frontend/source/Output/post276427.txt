Solarized dark + Zsh for terminal looks off <body> In some cases, I can't use iTerm2 and have to use the default terminal. The text is extremely hard to read, especially the black text on dark blue background. Is there a reason it's not the same as the iTerm2 Solarized theme? Is there a way to fix this? I imported the theme from the same themes file: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NtFpY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer276436> There is not a emgood/em way to fix this. As it states in the documentation      iTerm2 has better color fidelity than the built in Terminal, so your   themes will look better.   That being said, you can edit the color of the prompt via the terminal preferences.   Hope this helps!
