Use shift to select word until next capital letter <body> I am programming and from Windows I'm used to use the strong"shift" + "alt" + "arrow key right/left"/strong keys to select a part from a word until the next capital letter starts. But on my Mac this shortcut only selects the whole word. Can this be done somehow on a Mac too?  strongFor example:/strong  myVariable    em(is the text to select, cursor is at the beginning (before 'm'))./em  emNow using the shortcut "shift" + "alt" + "arrow key right" would select only 'my':/em  strongmy/strongVariable  em('my' is selected, pressing it again would then select the whole word.)/em  This is a shortcut often needed for example when programming using the programming language Java.  <answer283820> I found a solution to my problem, strongbut it only works for the IDE (development environment) I am using/strong, which is the program IntelliJ IDEA, and not system wide. But that fits my needs.  strongSolution:/strong  Go to strongPreferences  Keymap  Search for "move caret to"  Select "emMove Caret to Next Word in Different "Camel Humps" Mode/em"  Double Click it and select "emAdd keyboard shortcut/em"  Enter any shortcut you want./strong  You may also set a shortcut for doing the same thing but in the different direction.   <comment356537> This may be application-specific. Standard Mac toolbox for that key combo would just be 'add next letter to selection'. Opt/shift/arrow would be add next word. I've never know the 'add until next upper-case' structure at all, but maybe someone else would know. <comment356541> @grgarside Sorry, yes, you are right! I forgot to mention the "alt" key.
