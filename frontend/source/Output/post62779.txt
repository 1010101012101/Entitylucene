iTunes automatically stops/starts music whenever I start/stop Skype call <body> Couldn't find any similar questions.  So I like that my iTunes music automatically pauses when I accept a Skype call, but usually during a Skype call I turn up the volume. Then when my Skype call ends, my music comes back, but blasted in my ears. Is there a setting I should know of to prevent this?  I am on a Mac Air running Mountain Lion.   <answer62796> iTunes has a separate volume control that seems to run independently of the master volume control. It's in the top-left corner, press kbd⌘↑/kbd or kbd⌘↓/kbd in iTunes to adjust.  Yours may be too low relative to the master volume.  Skype too has a separate volume control. In the Skype app press kbd⌥⌘↑/kbd and kbd⌥⌘↓/kbd to adjust call output volume only.  <comment72515> ah, thank you! this seems useful. although i'm pretty sure there are some settings involved that can be set.
