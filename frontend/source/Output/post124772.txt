One Note for Mac Images not Showing <body> Now that One Note as come out for Mac I was trying it out but already have a problem in that all the images I insert do not render - I get just an outline and a red cross)  ul liTried jpg / png/li liVia Copy/Paste and insert option/li /ul  This is the result  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2tkM0.png" alt="enter image description here"  Am I doing something incorrect or perhaps have some setting I could change to fix this?  strongUpdate:/strong  Now I tried something else. I when to the online version and insert the image there. Now the app keeps crashing trying to sync.  I think it's just to soon to start using this. It's sad because the notebook/sections/pages concept is really good in my opinion   <comment145978> How do you insert them? (with such a new tool, you might need to walk us through the steps you took to cause the bug to appear) <comment145984> I tried via copy/paste and also the insert image option. <comment145988> So, you open the app and just paste an image that's already on your clipboard? <comment146030> @bmike that and also using the insert option. Both don't work <comment146036> I was hoping to recreate your problem, but neither of my Office365 accounts even work with version 15 of one note (the first public release) so I'll pass on making a third MS account for now. Since it's an editor's pick on the MAS, I bet you'll get an answer before too long unless a bug fix arrives from MS before then. <comment146114> Hmm, interesting, I can successfully import images in each of the ways that you've listed here.  I tried various sizes of images and can't replicate the issue that you're experiencing. <comment146148> @nadyne that's strange, there are a lot of people with problems with this app. From what I can tell it might have something to do with the accounts we're using. I tryed a new account and it worked, then deleted all my notebooks and tried again on my account and had the same problem. http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_onenote-onenote_mac/onenote-for-mac-crashes-at-start/1661c315-b61b-4b36-a5b9-665d0621c05e
