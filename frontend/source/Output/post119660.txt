Turn off message sending from iCloud? <body> Whenever I send someone a text, I'm told that it shows that "myname@icloud.com" is sending the text and not my phone number. And when someone responds to "myname@icloud.com", I receive the message on my computer and Wi-Fi only iPad, but not my iPhone. Is there any way to only send and receive messages from a phone number?  <answer119662> In your Settings go to Messages Send &amp; Receive and you should be able to set your preferences from there. Go to the "Start New Conversations From:" section and set your phone number to be the default.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9f30.png" width="300" /  If your phone number does not appear, turn FaceTime off and on. Phone number should show up   <answer139442> Go to    ul liSettings /li liMessages/li liSend &amp; Receive /li liUncheck the email address(es) just leaving your phone number checked./li /ul  You should be good from there.    <comment139577> Thanks! For some reason my phone number didn't appear in the "Start New Conversations From:" table. I tinkered with it and by chance tried turning "iMessage" on and off and my number appeared there. <comment139591> Awesome!
