Change directory last opened date every time you `cd` in Terminal <body> I use a codeRecent/code Smart folder, that depends on last opened date of the folder. It works fine when you browsing the Finder, but it doesn't register change when I use codecd/code command in a Terminal.  Is there a way to change last opened date of the folder every time I codecd/code to it in a terminal?  <answer277263> Open .bash_profile - or create it if it doesn't exist.  Add the line:  precodetcd () { touch "$1" &amp;&amp; cd "$1"; } /code/pre  and save the file.  Source your modified .bash_profile with codesource ~/.bash_profile/code or close all Terminal windows currently open.  Use codetcd folder_name/code to cd to it strongand/strong modify the access date.  hr  You can refine this by adding a condition that the argument has to be a folder.  <comment348999> Thanks for the answer, but I don't want to use another command other than `cd`. Also it seems that the script would modify the "Edited" date, not the "Last opened" date. <comment349000> @Boykodev touch changes the modification and access date! <comment349003> yeah, you're right. <comment349007> `touch` and `cd` - interesting...
