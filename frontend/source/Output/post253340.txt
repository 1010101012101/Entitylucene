Sending All Traffic Over VPN Tunnel (IKEv2) in OS X 10.11.5 <body> I recently setup VPN connections on my Macbook Pro running OS X 10.11.5 via the codeApple Configurator/code. However, I am having trouble sending all traffic across the VPN Tunnel rather than through the regular Wi-Fi Connection.  Although the codedefault route/code is created when the VPN is connected, no traffic is sent across the VPN (the VPN has been confirmed to be working in Windows and Linux).  Here is the output of:      netstat -rn   precode    Internet: Destination        Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire default            10.0.0.1           UGSc           43        0     en1 default            link#8             UCSI            0        0  ipsec0 10/16              link#5             UCS             8        0     en1 10.0.0.1/32        link#5             UCS             1        0     en1 10.0.0.1           &lt;EDGE ROUTER MAC&gt;  UHLWIir        47      194     en1      1076 10.0.143.243/32    link#5             UCS             1        0     en1 10.0.143.243       &lt;MBP MAC ADDRESS&gt;  UHLWI           0        1     lo0 45.32.180.111      10.0.0.1           UGHS            0        0     en1 127                127.0.0.1          UCS             0        0     lo0 127.0.0.1          127.0.0.1          UH             18   781055     lo0 169.254            link#5             UCS             0        0     en1 172.11.22.1        172.11.22.1        UH              0        0  ipsec0 224.0.0            link#5             UmCS            1        0     en1 224.0.0            link#8             UmCSI           0        0  ipsec0 224.0.0.251        1:0:5e:0:0:fb      UHmLWI          0        0     en1 255.255.255.255/32 link#5             UCS             0        0     en1 255.255.255.255/32 link#8             UCSI            0        0  ipsec0 /code/pre  There is no option to enable/disable forwarding all traffic over the VPN like there is with codePPTP/code.  How can I forward all traffic over the VPN when the VPN is active similar to how Windows and Linux already does this?  The more I dig into OS X and VPN Networking the more it seems like it would be easier to host a dual VPN of IPSec for the Windows and Linux clients and OpenVPN for OS X and iOS.  <answer256501> I met the same problem, but I found the checkbox exists in the strong"Apple Configurator2" VPN section/strong.   By installing the profile with enabling that option, all my traffic seems to pass under VPN.  <comment326407> I'm currently seeing the same problem, with no obvious solution yet. Did you find a solution to this problem? <comment327638> To answer my own comment, in a probably not very helpful manner: It seems like the routing tables were wrong, but I only solved this by rolling back the OS X test VM I was using. I suspect flushing the routing tables a bunch would help with this.
