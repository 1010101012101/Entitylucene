iOS mail - issue with CCing myself and encryption certificate <body> So I've been using iOS mail to support the use of my smime email certificate from a valid root CA. One of the things I like to do is cc or bcc myself to keep a copy in my inbox for quick reference while it's relavent. The issue is that if I encrypt it to send to another email I can't copy myself on it, Mail says there's an error and won't (can't) encrypt it. In the attached image the TO email is a valid certificate, installed on the phone, which I can send encrypted email to, and the CC email is the email I'm sending this message from which also has a valid certificate installed on the phone.   Has anyone seen this or know of a solution?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRDWr.jpg" alt="screenshot of email"
