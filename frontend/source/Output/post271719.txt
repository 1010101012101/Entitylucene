Fix iTunes on Windows being unresponsive and pixelated <body> iTunes 12 on Windows 10 on a Macbook Pro. On my retina display, iTunes is quite pixelated. Also, doing anything useful with it (sync'ing, converting, updating tags etc) causes the UI to freeze.  strongAre there any settings/tweaks to speed things up?/strong   Shouldn't it be scheduling work on some background threads to keep the UI responsive? Or is it recommended to use some other software on Windows to sync music with an iPhone/iPad?
