Upgrading Ram on macbook pro mid 2010 <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jbEA6.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hello, I would like to upgrade my macbook pro mid 2010's ram so it could run faster. I'm going to be a student next year so i'd like to lower the costs as much as I can.  what would be the maximum ram that i can upgrade it to?  Thank you for your help!  <answer233123> Max memory for that model Mac is 8GB. You should also consider replacing the spinning Hard Disk with a Solid State Drive (SSD). It would be like getting a brand new Mac.   <comment284974> +1 for SSD advice. I did both for my daughters MacBook, and the SSD made far more difference than the RAM bump.
