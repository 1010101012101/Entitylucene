VPN mountain lion server not working <body> I cannot connect to my mac server using a VPN connection from outside my LAN.  I can connect from inside which means that the VPN server on Mountain Lion is working.  When I look at the logs on my Netgear SRXN 3205 router I see the following log:  precode2012 Nov 27 17:00:37 [SRXN3205] [IKE] Could not find configuration for xxx.xx.xx.xx[500]_ 2012 Nov 27 17:00:37 [SRXN3205] [kernel] LOG_PACKET[ACCEPT]  IN=WAN  OUT=SELF SRC=xx.xx.xx.xx DST=xx.xx.xx.x PROTO=UDP SPT=500 DPT=500 /code/pre  On the router, I have VPN Pass through selected for IPsec, PPTP and L2TP and have forwarded ports UDP 4500 and UDP 1701.  If I try and forward UDP 500, the router rejects with the following message:     Port range conflicts with default service or HTTPS port(s)   Does anyone know how to get this working?  Many thanks  <comment84668> Even though I had forwarded the correct ports to the server, I also had to forward "IKE" service to the server.  Once I had done this, everything worked.
