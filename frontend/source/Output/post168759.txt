Unable to Install apps onto my iPad (Stuck on "waiting...") <body> For the past several days, I have been unable to install ANY apps onto my iPad.  When I click "GET" and then "INSTALL", it just says "Waiting..." below the app icon.    This is what it looks like (not from my iPad, from Google):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pb6wZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried the following to attempt to resolve the issue:  em(I had no other apps updating/installing)/em  ul liRestarted the device/li liTurned on and off the device/li liUpdated the iOS 8 software to latest version/li liWent to SettingsGeneralResetReset All Settings/li liRestarted AppStore/li liSynced my device with iTunes/li liDeleted app and tried to reinstall/li liLogged out of Appstore/li liLogged back in to Appstore/li liTurned off/on wifi/li /ul  In addition to not being able to download apps, I can't download books from iBooks either.  I don't know if this is a software issue, or if it's a network issue.  <answer169074> You could try doing a hard reset of your iPad.   Press and hold together the home button and the on/off button on the side of your iPad for a few seconds. This will make your screen go black and bring up the Apple logo. There is no need to do anything else. Device will reset itself and turn back on. This usually does the trick.  <comment198123> I'd try on another connection - starbucks etc. I think it's network, I've had similar issues in the past. [or try over 3/4G, if it's capable] One thing I did in the past was to remove all restrictions on my router from 17.x.x.x - Apple owns the entire subnet
