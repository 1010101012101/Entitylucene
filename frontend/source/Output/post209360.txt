How to close info window batchly <body> This habit was inherited from windows 7. I normally choose all the files and then right click and get the folder size. But when I do this in Macos, mac open all the file info. Then how can I close those windows at once? Thank you very much.  <answer209362> To close all strongFinder/strong emwindows/em at once, press the kbdOption/kbd key while clicking the strongFile/strong menu in strongFinder/strong and select strongClose All/strong or just press kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdW/kbd.  By the way, to get strongSummary Info/strong for multiple emfiles/folders/em in strongFinder/strong, select the target emfiles/folders/em and then kbdControl/kbd click and select strongGet Summary Info/strong.  Then you only have one strongGet Info/strong emsheet/em open and you can press kbdCommand/kbd-kbdW/kbd to close it.  To close just the ones from strongGet Info/strong use this AppleScript, by James Stout.  precodetell application "Finder"     set theWindowList to windows (* get all Finder windows *)     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindowList (* loop through them *)         set shouldClose to false (* reset to false *)         set this_item to item i of theWindowList (* get a window from the list *)         set windowName to name of this_item (* get the window'ss name  *)         (* this list should contain class property that tells you the type of window - which is nice *)         (* Class would be either "Finder window" for normal windows or "information window" for the Info windows *)         (* However, it doesn't contain the class property. alas. *)         (* So to differentiate, we can use the current view/panel props *)         set thePropList to get properties of this_item         (* in a try/catch as prop not set for the diff windows *)         try             set CurrentView to current panel of thePropList             set shouldClose to true (* no error, it's an info panel, so close *)         on error             log "Not an info panel, leaving open: " &amp; windowName         end try         (* this try/catch is just for a double check, feel free to comment out *)         try             set CurrentView to current view of thePropList         on error             if shouldClose = false then log "Not an info panel: " &amp; windowName         end try         if windowName ends with " Info" and shouldClose then             close this_item             log "Closing info panel: " &amp; windowName         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment253258> Thank you very much. Can I use the terminal to kill all of the info windows? Since I can't find the process with the name including "*info"
