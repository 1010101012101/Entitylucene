How to join the files into a similar directory tree? <body> I've two similar directory tree in different HD, but inside strongmany groups of subfolders/strong named e.g. B and C (strongnote inside B and C there are others subfolders/strong) there are different files (e.g. file 1,2 in the first and 3,4 in the second) . I would like to join the different files and substitute them if they have the same name. So at the end I would like to have in the folder B: 1 and 3 and in the folder C: 2 and 4. In windows I simply drag inside the old folder A the folder B and C from the second folder A then I click to strongsubstitute all/strong but if I do the same thing in OSX I delete file 1 and 2, because OSX substitute folder and not the files inside. How can I solve the problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/giTrF.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongPlease note, I have many folders and subfolders inside my A folder so I would like to do it as quick as I do it in Windows./strong  <answer105482> Finder has supported merging folders since 10.7:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1GMiK.png" alt=""  If the target folder has at least one file that is newer than the corresponding file in the source folder, Finder merges the folders by keeping the newer files, and the Merge button is shown as Keep Newer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wl1Qz.png" alt=""  The dialog with the Merge or Keep Newer button is shown if you copy a single folder but not if you move a folder or copy multiple folders.  Another option is to use codersync/code:  precodersync -aE ~/dir1/rootdirectory ~/dir2/ /code/pre  Options:  ul licode-a/code: archive (code-rlptgoD/code or code--resursive --links --perms --times --group --owner --devices --specials/code)/li licode-E/code: preserve extended attributes, resource forks, and ACLs/li licode-nv/code: show what files would be copied (code--dry-run --verbose/code)/li licode--ignore-existing/code: don't replace files that are older in the destination/li licode--delete/code:  delete files from the destination that don't have corresponding files in the source/li /ul  <answer105665> FileMerge (part of Developer Tools) can merge directories as well as files.  Just drag two directories on the Left and Right options and it will create a list of files indicating which are identical and which are part of Right or Left.  You can then choose how to merge the differences (and even specify a different merge path if you wish)  <comment123993> See non Finder answers to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/49263/merging-folders-when-copying-pasting-in-finder/49331#49331 <comment124110> you are right it doesn't work with sub folder so I can't use the first method.... <comment124228> @Mark In my case I have sub-folders I can't use Merge like the answer below or the accepted in the question you mentioned <comment124229> See the other **NON** finder answers e.g. rsync, third party and perhaps even the manual select <comment124234> @GM You'll want to use rsync or a [graphical file manager](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10097/what-orthodox-file-manager-for-os-x-could-i-use) such as [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/) if you need subfolders to get merged (or mount the drives on Windows using SMB file sharing from the Mac) <comment124235> Thanks a lot for the help! I'm trying with rsync but I've some problem...I will try with Transimit
