Calendar.app won't import iPhone calendar data <body> This has been an issue for a while now; my Calendar.app on Yosemite is empty, and will not import Calendar data from my iPhoneâ€”which is not associated or connected to an online account; its device-only data. In iTunes, I have Calendar Sync on, but nothing happens, and Calendar.app stays empty.  Note: I don't want my calendar to be part of an online account; but I do want it to sync to my macbook.  <comment316564> If your calendar will not be a part of your online account then the only option will be connecting your iPhone to computer every time you want to sync a new event or other changes. I am not aware of any available ways on offline syncing, because at some point you need to go online to sync. <comment316650> @alljamin - I'm okay with connecting the iphone to my macbook every time I want to sync, I do not need an online way to sync.
