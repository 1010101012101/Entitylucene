How can I send the currently active window to the back? <body> Is there a shortcut or such to send the currently active window to the back of the screen while still keeping it open (so that it ends up "beneath" all other open windows)?  <answer262190> Your question isn't very clear, but if what you want is a shortcut to cycle through all windows of the currently active app, you should be able to do this with the kbdCommand/kbdkbd~/kbd keyboard shortcut.  The kbd~/kbd key is usually located at left of the kbd1/kbd key.  Just to clarify, what the kbdCommand/kbdkbd~/kbd keyboard shortcut does is cycle through all windows of the current app you're in. For example, if you're using MS Word and have three documents open, it will cycle through those three documents.  However, the kbdCommand/kbdkbd~/kbd keyboard shortcut does not cycle through Tabs. For example, if you have Safari open with three windows and each window has five tabs open, using this shortcut will cycle through the three windows, not through the individual tabs.  Another option that may achieve what you want is the kbdCommand/kbdkbdM/kbd keyboard shortcut. However this emminimises/em the currently active window to the Dock, so I suspect that's not what you want.  If I've misunderstood your question totally, please clarify.  <answer262805> Short answer: strongNo/strong, Apple does not provide an API that allows you to alter an application window index except by bringing a window strongto the front/strong (index 1). emThere are no elegant solutions/em. But:  Long answer: strongYes/strong, You can use AppleScript to emeffectively/em move a window strongto the back/strong of a stack of AppleScript-able windows by collecting a list of windows, then rapidly moving each one (strongexcept/strong the frontmost) to the front, leaving the chosen window at the back.  Here is an example of an AppleScript which sends the frontmost Finder Window to the back.  precodetell application "Finder"     set winList to every window whose visible is true     if not winList = {} then         repeat with oWin in (items 1 through -2 of reverse of winList)             set index of oWin to 1         end repeat     end if end tell /code/pre  This script is based on a solution by JMichaelTX discussed on the KeyboardMaestro forum.  The reshuffling is incredibly fast, but in the Script Editor you can inspect how it works, leaving "506" on the bottom and popping "502-505" up in a way that preserves their order:  precodeget every window whose visible = true     --&gt; {Finder window id 506, Finder window id 505, Finder window id 504, Finder window id 503, Finder window id 502} set index of Finder window id 502 to 1     --&gt; 1 set index of Finder window id 503 to 1     --&gt; 1 set index of Finder window id 504 to 1     --&gt; 1 set index of Finder window id 505 to 1     --&gt; 1 /code/pre  You can map this AppleScript to a service or keyboard shortcut, either by a) putting the script into a Run AppleScript action inside an Automator service, or b) using a launcher (Alfred, Keyboard Maestro etc.). For details on Applescript keyboard assignment see: How do I assign a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript I wrote?  This may satisfy OPs needs -- it is unclear from the original post. This solution can also be extended to multiple AppleScript-able applications. I am emnot/em, however, aware of a solution to make it work effectively with a mix of scriptable and non-scriptable windows, due to the fact that in AppleScript, codeSystem Events/code addressable windows for non-scriptable applications do not have a codeset index/code verb/property. There exists an "AXRaise" action for some windows when assistive devices / accessibility is turned on, but this also does not apply to all windows. Elaborate hacks exist that involve walking through each active application and show/hiding or minimizing/restoring windows, but they are a mess.

In most applications Shift--~ will cycle through the current app's windows, which is probably closest to what you're looking for. <comment285677> I know about it, it's not what I want. <comment328444> If you want to send it all the way to the back, which window should be your focused? The previous selected window? <comment329204> I think that this is the use case that the OP wants: say I have the messages app open in front of my mail app and I want to quickly bring the mail app to the foreground and send messages to the background, I can do a keyboard shortcut and the messages app will be behind my mail app. I tried your keyboard shortcut and this did not accomplish that.
