Where has my route gone in the Activity app? <body> I did a cycle ride at the weekend and recorded the workout on my Apple Watch. When I finished I saved the workout and could see the route in the Activity app on my iPhone.  Now a couple of days later I can view the workout stats such as distance and average speed. However, I can no longer see the route. I can see routes for other workouts.  Has anyone else experienced this and has a fix for it? I'm sure the data is still there  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9WKR.png" alt="Workout"  <answer287023> I recently had the same issue. I force restarted the watch and the next activity it showed a map again.  Still testing if it resolved the issue for ever.   <comment356824> Did you use the same app to record the activity?  I found that one of my exercise apps didn't save the route to Activity.  I could see the detailed data, just like you, but not the route.  Maybe this is similar? <comment356826> Yes it was just the built-in workout app. It does sound similar to what you describe although I could view the route for a while before it disappeared. <comment356830> In the Activity app is the icon on that specific workout the regular ring or is it a different app?  Just making sure the correct app was used to record the cycle ride. <comment356834> Yes, it looks normal to me. I've just added a screenshot to my question. <comment356835> Thanks for the screenshot, that helps.  I don't see anything wrong with the workout (29m, holy cow!).  If other, similar workouts have a map then, sorry,  I don't know what to tell you. <comment356838> Ok, thanks anyway. Shame I can't show you the route as it involved two ferry crossings and an island. It looked quite good on the map! <comment362293> You say that resolved it for the next activity, but what about the one for which the map disappeared?
