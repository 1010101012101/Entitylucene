How to test hard drive - diskutility reports defective drive as perfectly fine <body> stronglong story/strong I have an USB drive to copy data between Mac, Windows (personally I don't own any) and PS4 - it is exfat formatted.  Recently I noticed my Mac would freeze when I plug in this disc - also there is a directory in the top hierarchy that I could not open.  Since this drive moves around a lot I suspected an unlucky disconnection caused corruption. Checked the drive and the only partition with disk-utility "first aid" - which report everything is fine.  Despite this in the system log there are plenty of I/O errors.  Looks like I need to trash it.  But I sure had loved it if my mac gave me any warning that I was using a bad drive (I kinda forgive the PS4 that she didn't warn).  So for the future what check should I use?    I see that there are older questions discussing a similar questions, though they are 5 years old and also some of the link tools are dead now.  Also this question is not about data recovery, but how to asses a drive.  strongtl;dr/strong What program (on mac) can I trust to check my discs?  <answer283022> I reccomend Disk Drill.  Their diagnostic and monitoring tools are free, but the recovery is what (if you need it) you will have to purchase.  There's also a very robust set of command line (CLI) tools available as open source:  smartmontools.  This is a available as a macOS package so you don't need to install via codebrew/code or codeMacPorts/code.  strongImportant:/strong  One thing to keep in mind when diagnosing external drives is that you have two components:  ul lithe drive itself/li lithe USB enclosure/li /ul  I have had USB enclosure's fail (the USB to SATA portion) that looked like a drive failure.  The best way to get around this is to remove the drive (if you can) and use a separate USB-SATA Adapter.  What you are doing is eliminating one of the components from the diagnostic equation (the USB interface) with a "known working" component.  They are cheap (approx $10) to keep for diagnostic purposes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cWdCzm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  That said, a drive diagnostic is not a "quick status check."  To find bad blocks you may need to do a "deep scan" because a bad block isn't report until the drive encounters a bad block.  <comment356754> You might want to consider purchasing an external SSD for the inevitable replacement drive instead of spinning platters, which are so 20th century. <comment356757> I just tested Disk Drill - it seems only to look for deleted files.  I couldn't see any indication of bad blocks or a bad drive. <comment356760> I added some relevant info to the answer.. <comment356764> If you have I/O errors for that drive in the system.log then you already have your answer, the drive is defective. Replace it! Disk Utility does not perform a full disk low level sector-by-sector test and that's why it can say a disk is okay when in fact it's not. You can use `dd`, which is already installed, to preform a low level sector-by-sector test. <comment356769> Smartmontools looks promising.  Took me some time till I found the kernel driver. And now it will run overnight with a selftest. <comment356772> @user3439894 I totally agree.  My confusion is just - Finder won't alert me, diskutil tells me all is ok.  In the future - how can I find out I am working on a "dying" disk?  Hoping messages in system log will pop up doesn't sound reliable to me.  Other OSes at least give some error message.
