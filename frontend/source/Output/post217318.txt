Logitech Ultrathin mouse scroll behaviour on mac <body> i am using a Logitech UltraThin T630 mouse with a macbook pro (2015, os 10.11.1) and i am having a strange scroll behaviour. I mean its working but its different to the mouse working on windows.  Let try to describe it:  Normally (and on windows) scrolling works directly. When i scroll on the mouse, the site (i.e. in a webbrowser) moves directly. But on mac this mouse starts scrolling as soon as i release the finger from the mouse. This leads to an indirect scrolling which is annoying.   Does anybody has the same issue and can deliver any solution to this?  <answer217727> Okay, in the case that anybody has the same problem:  Simply download 5.30.150 and use it. It works like a charm http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Mice-and-Pointing-Devices/T651-Trackpad-and-Ultra-Thin-Touch-Mouse-issues-with-Logitech/m-p/1458806
