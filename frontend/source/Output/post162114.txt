Solid state hard driveâ€”Haven't been able to do a clean Reinstall of Operating System. <body> Any suggestions?  Going to try to be linear in explaining what I did:  -Have a 2010 Macbook Pro 7,1 / I swapped out to a solid state drive.  -I have to try to get to at least Lion: It had it, but then crashed, and it would only reset to the original operating system, Snow Leopard. But I need at least Lion for security issues, etc. I'm trying to get Yosemite on it, but all is failing.  -error with trying to boot from the original OX 10.6.3 disk. Won't do it.  -won't do a recovery install from command-R / ****I can't find out whether I can even do that on a newly formatted SSD on this older Mb Pro model. I'm not sure if it's just not going to happen and I need to try to do an install of the original operating system somehow.  -Made a bootable USB thumb drive with Yosemite, but just crashed it to the 0 with slash sign through it.   If anyone has any suggestions, much appreciated. I would try to clone the old hard drive, but the reason why I can't is that I couldn't verify permissions, etc.  the hard drive seemed to have issues, and/or the software OS seemed to be an issue to, therefore the clean install.  <comment189445> "It had it, but then crashed, and it would only reset to the original operating system, Snow Leopard." Can you be more specific in what exactly worked and didn't work here? <comment189666> starting with the simplest option.  it sounds like you downloaded a yosemite installer.  do you have another mac you can put into slave mode and use for installing from one drive to another?
