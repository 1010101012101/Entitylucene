Which command to only output the IPv6 routing table? <body> code$ netstat -nr/code is great for outputting the Mac OS X IP routing tables.  However its output is long as it contains both IPv4 and IP6 routing tables.  Sometimes I wish to output only the IPv6 routing table. Which short terminal command can I use to only see the IPv6 routing table?  <answer234333> precode$ netstat -nr | sed -e '1,/Internet6:/d' Destination                             Gateway                         Flags         Netif Expire ::1                                     ::1                             UHL             lo0 fe80::%lo0/64                           fe80::1%lo0                     UcI             lo0 fe80::1%lo0                             link#1                          UHLI            lo0 fe80::%en4/64                           link#4                          UCI             en4 fe80::ae7f:3eff:fee6:5fc7%en4           ac:7f:3e:e6:5f:c7               UHLI            lo0 fe80::%en0/64                           link#5                          UCI             en0 ff01::%lo0/32                           ::1                             UmCI            lo0 ff01::%en4/32                           link#4                          UmCI            en4 ff01::%en0/32                           link#5                          UmCI            en0 ff02::%lo0/32                           ::1                             UmCI            lo0 ff02::%en4/32                           link#4                          UmCI            en4 ff02::%en0/32                           link#5                          UmCI            en0 /code/pre  <answer234337> To output only IPv6 info, use the code-f address_family/code emoption/em.  Example: codenetstat -nr -f inet6/code  From the codenetstat/code man page:     âˆ’f address_family      Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of the   specified address family. The following address families are   recognized: inet, for AF_INET, inet6, for AF_INET6 and unix, for   AF_UNIX.   <comment286486> You do not need to _pipe_ to _sed_, just use: `netstat -nr -f inet6` <comment286488> @user3439894 Your comment is a good answer in my opinion. Why not post it as an answer so I can accept your answer?
