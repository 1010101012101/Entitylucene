How can I prevent iTunes from auto starting when I plug in an iOS device? <body> i know we already have topics about it, but i did not found my solution.  So i don't want to start iTunes, when i plug in iDevices. We have like 300 iPads, and i am using the configurator. iTunes still starting automatically, even when the Configurator is running.  I really don't want to turn off this settings under the iPad summary screen one by one. I have already turned off the autosync.  <answer178925> The only way I know to not have to set it for each &amp; every device individually is to disable the iTunesHelper app from Users &amp; Group control panel  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6B0iE.png" alt="enter image description here"  picture source http://www.redmondpie.com/disable-automatic-itunes-launch-when-iphone-is-connected-to-windows-or-mac-how-to/  <answer178928> If the problem you're experiencing is that the iPad connections trigger a New iPad activation dialog, you can turn this off by typing this terminal command strongwhen iTunes is not running/strong:  precodedefaults write com.apple.iTunes StoreActivationMode -integer 1 /code/pre  You can turn on the new iPad Activation dialog with this command:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.iTunes StoreActivationMode /code/pre  Remember, iTunes cannot be running when either of these commands is run.  <comment213269> This has a very unpleasant side-effect if used on your regular iTunes & regular phone - a never-ending cycle of 'trust this computer?' Yes. "This phone has already been activated & may be disconnected." (which also deletes any existing backups from MobileSync) I'm glad I remembered this post & looked it up again.
