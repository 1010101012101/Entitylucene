OS X Photos show old photos as new <body> A couple of days ago I noticed that Photos on El Capitan shows already imported photos as new photos, when I select an iOS device. The iOS devices are synced with the Photos library and contain the albums local. This happens only for a few photos, not all of them.  My Photos library contain a couple of thousand photos. You will notice in the screenshot below that only 11 photos on my iPad are strongnew/strong. However, those photos are years strongold/strong and got already imported into an album.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nO7o1.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried following:  ul liStarted Photos with kbd⌥/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd and repaired the library/li liImported the photos to a fake album and deleted them afterwards/li /ul  Unfortunately, nothing helped. Does anyone have an idea, what I can do, to get rid of the strongold/strong or strongnew/strong photos?
