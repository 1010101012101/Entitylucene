How to remove icon from Launchpad forcefully <body> I updated GIMP from MacUpdates since then I got two Gimp icons in Launchpad. I also deleted the Gimp.app from finder but now i get this question mark on the gimp icon in Launchpad. How to completely remove both of these icons?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1K8fl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer175990> [Worked] In Yosemite open Launchpad, hold down control key and click on icon you wish to remove. A question mark should appear over the icon. Just drag and drop to Trash.  <answer210566> Worked exactly as indicated above. Hold control and click the offending icon and it will appear with a ? over it, drag it to the trash bin and it's gone.  Works Even with problem icons that do not show up in finder, had ostensibly been deleted by appcleaner and did not show an X when jiggling mode entered.  <comment207665> This image is a [nice addition to other ways to remove icons from LaunchPad](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17863/how-do-you-delete-apps-from-lions-launchpad). <comment254156> Welcome to Ask Different!
