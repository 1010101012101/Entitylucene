Alignment errors on Fusion Drive caused by differing block sizes? <body> I have some alignment errors on my Fusion Drive after? reorder the CoreStorage.  For some weeks ago I got my purchased iMac 27 and made out, that the index order of the SSD and HDD drives are wrong. At index 0 there was the hdd and on index 1 pointed to the SSD. The problem was that the Operations during the work on the mac was very slow.  So I made a new clean install, created a new CoreStorage and reordered the Fusion Drive, so that the SSD is at index 0. Please look what I mean:  precodediskutil cs list      CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group      =========================================================     Name:         OSX-MacintoshLVG     Status:       Online     Size:         1022898851840 B (1.0 TB)     Free Space:   45056 B (45.1 KB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume      |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     23553724416 B (23.6 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume      |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     999345127424 B (999.3 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family          ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         None         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume              ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          1021994074112 B (1.0 TB)             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS             LVG Type:              Fusion, Sparse /code/pre  I wrote after reorder because I'm not sure that was before I create the new CoreStorage.  After made out the alignment errors I checke the block size of the two drives that differs!  HDD:  precodediskutil info /dev/disk0 | grep "Block Size"    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes /code/pre  SSD:   precodediskutil info /dev/disk1 | grep "Block Size"    Device Block Size:        4096 Bytes /code/pre  I think that's the problem that I've got this errors.  strongQuestion 1/strong: Does a method exist to modify the block size of the 512 Bytes drive to 4096 Bytes?  strongQuestion 2:/strong Is it possible to lose data caused by the different block sizes (I/O errors)?.  The iMac actually is running without problems, but some of my pdf documents gives me cryptic output if I copy some text from there. I mean if I paste the copied text into another document I got cryptic output.
