How do I pair iOS Remote with iTunes? <body> I'm using iOS 10 on an iPhone 6, with the latest Remote app (updated today). I want to use it to control iTunes on my MacBook Pro, running OS 10.11.6. Both devices are on the same wi-fi network and have Bluetooth enabled.  In the iOS Remote app, I click "Add a Device". It tells me to go to iTunes and click the Remote button in the top left of the window. But there's no such button! Where do I find it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Ozev.png" width="250"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWEdu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer252954> You mentioned, you have wifi and bluetooth on. You only need wifi on. You must also strongfirst have home sharing turned on in iTunes/strong.  strongFor Home Sharing,/strong you’ll need to use the same Apple ID across all your devices. Here’s how to check the Apple ID on each device:  ul liOn your Mac or PC, open iTunes and look under File  Home Sharing. To use a different Apple ID with Home Sharing, choose Turn Off Home Sharing, then set up Home Sharing again./li liOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, go to Settings  Music or Settings  Videos./li /ul  strongIf you have Remote 2.0 (or later) and Home Sharing is turned on/strong, you can set Remote to pair automatically with any of the iTunes libraries on your Home Sharing network.

First I opened Remote and clicked "Add A Device".  Then in iTunes, I clicked the phone icon below the volume slider. This became a drop-down menu, and one of the items was a Remote icon. (This didn't work every time; I first had to disconnect and re-connect my phone to the wi-fi network.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kjDsO.png" alt="enter image description here"  Finally, I was able to enter the code in iTunes, and it paired the devices.  I didn't need Home Sharing turned on.  <comment314756> Thanks. I've tried all this, but the button's still not appearing in iTunes. The impression I get from [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph19503?locale=en_US) is that Home Sharing is optional. But I tried turning it on and following the second set of instructions, and no shared libraries appeared. <comment343688> I, too, do not have this 'remote' button in itunes. Seems like this is a widespread question out there. Still haven't found an answer (alas, @JW s answer doesn't work for me either) <comment357029> Do you have to have your iPhone plugged into your machine for this?
