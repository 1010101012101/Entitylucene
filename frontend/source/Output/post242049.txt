How does the iPhone know it's not using an Apple cable? <body> Sometimes when I plug a cable in to charge, the iPhone says it may not work with this device. How does it know it's not an Apple cable?  <answer242057> Apple has a program called MFi and detects if the cable has a certified chip inside. The chip just says that it's been officially 'Made For iOS.'  <comment297609> Just let you know it is not reliable. Using official cable would show up this prompt ocassionally. <comment297742> I don't know about that.. Can you provide some kind of evidence or documentation on this Apple "certified chip"? <comment298094> @tjt263, this post goes into detail about the chipâ€™s internals: http://blog.freedelity.be/blogs_message-49-1-Hacking_the_Lighning_cable__let_s_talk_tech.html
