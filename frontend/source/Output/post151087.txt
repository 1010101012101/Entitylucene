Aggressize standard stream buffering in latest Command Line Tools (6.1) <body> I just upgraded my "Command Line Tools" via App Store.app's update process to Version 6.1. It seemed to install just fine, but a lot of commonly used command line tools now have much more aggressive buffering (presumably, a much larger buffer block size).  For example:  ul licodegrep/code: previously I didn't have to use code--line-buffered/code to get immediate output, now I do./li licodejq/code: offers an code--unbuffered/code option, with desired effect, similar to codegrep/code/li /ul  I don't have to use these options when they are the last item in my piped command, i.e., when the output is a TTY; the buffering comes into play when I pipe them into a subsequent command (even just codecat/code).  I would prefer to have small-by-default buffers while I'm tooling around on the command line. Is there some system preference / kernel extension where I can revert the behavior of streaming tools like codegrep/code? Some codestdout_default_buffer_block_size/code variable that applies globally (or at least within my shell session)?
