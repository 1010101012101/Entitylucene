How can I show only an .htaccess file in the Finder? <body> I'm a web developer. I really need to use code.htaccess/code file.br How can make Finder show only the code.htaccess/code file and not all the file prefixed with code./code?  I am running OS X Lion.  <answer28426> To my best knowledge, you cannot selectively display dot files in Finder. However, if you just need a way to easily open them via Finder, you could create a symlink to the file in its directory, omitting the dot in the name, i.e.:  ol liopen Terminal, codecd/code into your folder;/li licodeln -s $PWD/.htaccess $PWD/htaccess/code./li /ol  You can then open the file by double-clicking the newly created link, select an editor in the link’s context menu etc. However, if you want to copy, up- or download your code.htaccess/code file, you are stuck with Terminal, full display of all dot files, or temporarily renaming the file (to code_htaccess/code, say).  <answer42690> Tried many method, the best way for me is use Houdini.br Houdini can easily hide and display all hidden.  <comment32666> Good question!! I need this too. <comment52307> Didn’t you specifically ask for a solution that does **not** display all dot files (“How can make Finder show only the `.htaccess` file and not all the file prefixed with `.`?”)? Houdini doesn’t do that, AFAIK. <comment187459> Thanks for the app, at least this is less painful than opening the terminal.
