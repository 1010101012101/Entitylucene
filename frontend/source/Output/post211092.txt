Markdown + Latex for iOS <body> Simple question: Is there any markdown editor for iOS which supports inline Latex commands (and preview)?  <answer211139> The short answer is "no", I've been looking myself.  TexWriter is a decent LaTex editor and preview but I don't know of a MarkDown one with inline LaTex.  Further, you might want to check out Brett Terpstra's page devoted to iOS editors for a great list of editors and keep an eye out for any that add "LaTex" as an extra feature.  <answer230092> Atom plus the Pandoc package appears to give you a large swath of the functionality of Latex and Markdown.  To get all of that working, you'll need to have Pandoc and Mac Latex installed already. When I have enough rep points to post more links, I'll provide references for these too!  <comment280795> How does this work in iOS? <comment280796> Hello @patrix , I'm not sure what you mean. <comment280801> The question is about solutions for iOS. Does Atom run on iOS?
