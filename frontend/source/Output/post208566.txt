How can I force my phone to send iMessage instead of SMS? (I'm in a mobile promo) [Iphone 5 iOS 9.0.2] <body> I am new to apple and I want to use iMessage. When I am connected to the internet, I thought SMS would automatically send as iMessage. The one I'm texting also uses iPhone 5 and we're both connected to internet.  I still have to know what their e-mail to text them in iMessage.  <answer208575> You can go to Settings  Messages and turn the Send as SMS option off. (The actual names of the options may be different as I am just translating from my local language settings.)
