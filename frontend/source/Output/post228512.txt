How do I add Chrome to my path <body> I am trying to use Flammarion and its instructions state that I should ensure that chrome is on my path.  The Chrome app appears to be at code/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/code. How do I actually add this to my path.  <answer228514> You need to edit your code.bash_profile/code which is located in your home directory.  I don't reccommend using TextEdit to modify this file, use codevi/code or codenano/code in Terminal instead  h2Open Terminal in home directory/h2   You should be at your home directory but to be sure, just type:  code$ cd ~/code  h2Edit .bash_profile/h2  code$ nano .bash_profile/code  Your's may not even exist so you may just start off with a blank screen.  Not to worry, each is totally customizable.  If you don't have a PATH statement in there already, just add the following to a new line:  codeexport PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH"/code  (BTW, I am assuming your software wants the path to the actual Google Chrome binary).  If you alredy have a paths statement, append the path to Chrome to the existing statement and separate it with a colon:  h3Before:/h3  precodeexport PATH=/path/to/some/stuff /code/pre  h3After:/h3  precodeexport PATH=/path/to/some/stuff:/path/to/more/stuff /code/pre  Hit Ctrl X to exit.  You will be asked if you want to save; say yes.  h2 Restart Terminal & Test/h2  Quit that shell and start it again so your changes can take effect.  To ensure that your path now reflects your changes, type the following command:  codeecho $PATH/code  Your new path should now show the Google Chrome directory.  To further test it, in the Terminal window at in your home directory type code"Google Chrome"/code and Chrome should launch.  <comment278694> We are on OSX. Just edit paths.d.
