How to open .plist files in macOS Sierra without using Xcode? <body> strongProblem/strong  I just went to use Property List Editor to look at a .plist file and it no longer works in Sierra   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ovR8g.png" alt="Error"  &nbsp;  strongMy Setup/strong  Mid-2010 15" MBP macOS Sierra 10.12  &nbsp;  strongCrucial Comment/strong  I strongdo not/strong want to use Xcode to open .plist files, it's too much for such a simple task. The Property List Editor was perfect.  &nbsp;  strongWhat I have Found/strong  As of 2016-09-13 The Apple Developer website describes Xcode as the only option to edit .plist files (search for: About Information Property List Files)  Apple mentions using Xcode to generate and work with .plist files but there has to be another way.  &nbsp;  ol liIs the Property List Editor App done in macOS Sierra?/li liIf so, other than Xcode, are there any simple programs like the Property List Editor that people recommend?/li /ol  &nbsp;  Thank you for your responses!  &nbsp;  strongUPDATE/strong  ol liThis is not a "duplicate" question. This question is specifically for those who are used to using Property List Editor and have lost it as an option when upgrading to macOS Sierra. So keeping this question thread will help others with the specific issue, especially if they are not a fan of using Xcode to work with plist files and/or do not know how to work with plist files through terminal./li liThe solution linked in the "claimed" duplicate thread can be useful to those familiar with terminal./li liThose familiar with terminal, you can also use rlwrap and PlistBuddy, which strongIS/strong currently working in macOS Sierra. See: fgimian.github.io/blog/2015/06/27/a-simple-plistbuddy-tutorial//li liThose not familiar with terminal who want to avoid Xcode: sorry, I haven't found a solution for you but I'll keep looking into it. If anyone else has a suggestion please add it.

If you right click on any .plist file and click "Get Info", under "Open With" there should be an option to change the default editor for it, which you would then change to Pref Setter. If you click on "Change All", it will change it for every .plist file on your system.  <comment317509> Not every plist file is text some are binary http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/101719/trouble-opening-plist-files-in-text-editor
