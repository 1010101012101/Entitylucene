MacOS X 10.7.5 screen flickers in black and freezes for 2 minutes <body> Recently noticed a problem - in Finder, column view (this is important) if I select a pdf file (noticed only for pdf) screen flickers quickly several times in black color and the whole system freezes (except mouse cursor) for 2 minutes (I've measured with timer). After that, everything goes normally, file preview is displayed on the right side in Finder window as it is expected to be and file can be normally opened with Preview app.   Can anyone suggest on this? Where should I start looking to for more information (any logs)?  I have MBP late 2008 aluminium unibody with 4GB RAM, 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo.   <comment108493> Select as open or just select? do you have adobe reader installed ? <comment108494> Just check the default view in Console.app. Have you tried hiding the preview column? You could also try running `qlmanage -r` or something like `qlmanage -d 2 -p file.pdf`. <comment108511> @Buscarì›ƒ just select. and this happens regardless of the file, it just should be pdf. <comment108512> @LauriRanta with no preview column - no problems. what do you mean by "check the default view in Console.app"? <comment108567> I meant System Log Queries  All Messages (which is shown by default when opening Console).
