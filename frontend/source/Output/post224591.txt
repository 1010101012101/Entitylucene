What does hitting the tab button do in terminal? <body> In Terminal, if I hit kbd tab /kbd twice, Terminal asks if I want to list all 1580 possibilities. What is this, and what is this used for?  <answer224595> Pressing 'Tab' in terminal autocompletes commands and/or paths. Pressing it twice while there are no any part of any command/path is entered proposes to you to show all possible commands.  <comment272390> Ohh yeah, I remember reading that somewhere before. Thanks!
