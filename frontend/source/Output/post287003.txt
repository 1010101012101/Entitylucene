I am unable to write my signature using the trackpad in Preview.app <body> I click on the signature button in the Preview.app toolbar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qytdd.png" width="600"  The following box pops up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WjvW8.png" width="300"  I click on the kbdClick Here To Begin/kbd button. The box is now ready for input:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U3k5G.jpg" width="300"  However, I cannot get any markings at all to show up as my signature. My box always looks like the above image.  I've tried doing the above in an image document and a PDF document. I've tried holding down the trackpad while writing and not holding the trackpad down while writing. I've tried using a mouse.  Is there a fix for this bug, so that I can use my Macbook trackpad to write my signature?  Note: the Camera-based signature method technically works on my machine. However, its rendition ability isn't great.  hr  subOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. /sub  hr  <comment362331> I know that I can create my signature in any number of other applications, so this bug is not a huge issue. I thought that I would make this post because I couldn't find a post about this bug online.
