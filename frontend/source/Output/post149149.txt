Issues with Screen Scaling on External Monitor <body> I am using a 2011 Macbook Pro and a horrible Dell Display for some extra space. Because the resolution is horrible on the extra screen, the windows are larger then I would like and Mac OS X does not let me change the scale for it.  Is there an app of something else I could use to solve my problem?  <answer149152> I think changing the screen resolution on the external display could help you in this case. Initially when you open up the strongemDisplays Settings/em/strong from strongemSystem Preferences/em/strong. It would look something like this below with a limited set of display resolutions. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I63VH.png" alt="enter image description here"  This list of resolution is what OS X thinks is the best for your Display. When connecting an external monitor/display, there are chances the aspect ratio is wrong because it's a widescreen monitor.   h2Solution/h2  ul liOpen the Display Settings from System Preferences on the second monitor. /li liHold the kbdOption/kbd key and click on the codeScaled/code button. It should open up a lot more Display resolutions. /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0KI7.png" alt="enter image description here" Try finding what's the best option for your display/monitor by trial and error.  <comment176828> @LucienGaitskell Don't think there is any other option if it's an LCD. It wouldn't use up all the screen space because as I mentioned earlier it depends on the aspect ratio of the monitor.
