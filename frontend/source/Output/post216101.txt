Name Extension based launcher for Mac <body> Here is an example of what I need. I have a code.md/code file (markdown). I use e.g. 3 MD-related applications: Sublime for more developer stuff; Ulysses for more writing stuff; Marked for viewing; Typed for short stories.  I would need an app that would give me a short beautiful menu of my apps I want to assign with the extension. In this case the workflow would be:  ul liIssue open command on a codemd/code file/li liSince this app is registered as default handler, it popups and then/li liI can choose quickly (by hitting the number, letter, or cursors) the menu option/li liThat is going to open the target application./li /ul  Is there such a 'opening-proxy' tool?  h2EDIT/h2  This tool should not depend on Finder.  <answer216149> After searching a lot: Magic Launch. It does almost like what I ask, except you can't set more then one app per rule.  <answer216161> Another solution is Alfred. There is a shortkey that popups Alfred window pre-populated with currently selected file. Then you can choose strongOpen With.../strong to choose which app you want to open file with.  <comment261106> Hazel is for folder monitoring. KM is for shortkeys - or at least I dont know how can I trigger a shortkey that is system-wide for file selected not only in Finder. <comment261120> I do use Alfred, but dont know how can I trigger it on certain file. I am not using Finder much, but other file manager, hence I see this proxy as a program that is registered as default app for all extensions, and then I can fine-tune the apps that I need. <comment261183> [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) is a similar tool to use the keyboard and search to choose which app receives the input you select via the tool.
