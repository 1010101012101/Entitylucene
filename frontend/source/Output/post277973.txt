Resolution switching, window size, and restarting <body> When I select Restart... or Shutdown... from the Apple menu I'm given the option to decide if I want to  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4cBDR.png" alt="reopen windows when logging back in"  Which I never select because I have my display scaled as far over to More Space as macOS will let me go.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FCK8I.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Displays Scaled for more space"  However that scaling doesn't take place until emafter all the applications have been launched/em which screws up their location on the screen and size.   When I update macOS it never gives me the option to uncheck that box.  My current work around (when I actually remember) is to quit all the other applications except the App Store when I choose to update, but is there a better way to avoid this kerfuffle?   I thought I used to remember a user preference that let you set this default for your user.
