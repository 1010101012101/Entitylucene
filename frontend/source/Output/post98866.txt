How Do I Stop the Native Podcast App from Removing Played Episodes? <body> I often listen to podcasts as I fall to sleep.  The result is a podcast may finish playing without me actually having finished it.  The annoying thing is the Podcast then emremoves/em the episode thinking it's played &amp; no longer needed.    Is there a way to stop this behavior.  I would rather the app simply keep the last X episodes, regardless if it believe they had been listed to or not?  I know I can add them back, but it's somewhat tedious to keep doing that.   I tried looking in both the settings for the Podcast app &amp; while it's connected to iTunes, but couldn't find anything.  <answer98961> In iTunes on the computer when the iOS device is connected choose the device in the sidebar. This will goive a page with a menu on top allow select od Podcast. Like this img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VtxJH.png" alt="enter image description here"  The second oval shows that I have selected to sync podcasts automatically keeping the 5 least recent unplayed.  Alter these options to either keep updates manual or choose new rather than unplayed.  <comment116300> Can't believe I didn't check there!  *forehead slap*  Thanks!
