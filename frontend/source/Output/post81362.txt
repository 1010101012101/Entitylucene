How to export a date range in Calendar <body> I would like to export some of the events in one of my calendars. The export function will create a code.ics/code file with the ementire/em calendar, but I only want to export events within a specified date range. How can I do that?  <answer81377> A workaround would be:  ul liCreate a temporary calendar from FileNew Calendar./li liMark the calendars you want to export:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9IsKU.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liDepending on the time range you want to export select week or month view:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NPDr6.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liGo to the week or month you want to export, press kbd⌘/kbdkbdA/kbd to select all events and kbd⌘/kbdkbdC/kbd to copy them./li liSelect the temporary calendar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4MLob.png" alt="enter image description here"  and press kbd⌘/kbdkbdV/kbd to paste all previously copied events. /li liExport the temporary calendar as an ics file:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bYfIX.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liDelete the temporary calendar with EditDelete./li /ul  <answer114571> Although jaume came up with an very easy workaround somebody might be looking for an even easier solution. Take a look at the Calex App which offers a little bit more features. For example Calex lets you export multiple calendars into one single file.     <comment93800> I can offer you an obvious workaround: create a temporary calendar, copy your events there and export it. <comment93803> Sure, but how can I select and copy, say, one year worth of events? <comment93804> Select month view and copy all 12 months (unfortunately you can't copy/paste in year view). I know, not ideal, just a workaround, as said above... <comment93805> Thanks, it's not ideal, but it works. You might want to post that as an answer. I'll be glad to accept it if nothing better comes up in the following couple of days. <comment93809> Added, hopefully someone has a better answer...
