Images are distorted when copy-pasting them into PowerPoint <body> Since updating to macOS Sierra, whenever I copy-paste something from Chrome to Powerpoint, the image is distorted (see an example slide below). Pasting into other applications, e.g., Gimp, does not lead to the same distortion.  Anybody has a clue how to fix this?

You might also want to paste the image into Preview, save as .jpg (or other format) and then import the file into PP. I know this adds several steps, but it may be easier (and less painful) than banging your head against the Microsoft wall. <comment330573> Were you referring to the skewed aspect ratio? <comment330841> Yup, the original image is straight.
