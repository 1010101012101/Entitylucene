Can I be signed into iCloud with more than one user? <body> Often, with iCloud, one wishes to not engage in trial and error before finding the answers to questions.   I would like to sign into my iCloud with two users, one admin, one standard ( dev user).  Is this something that is often done, and won't mess up my iCloud setup on the server?  EDIT: To clarify, my iCloud account, signed into two local accounts, residing on my OS X 10.10.3 MacBooks {Pro, Air}  <comment228541> AFIK the iCloud is user specific. <comment228543> Edited to clarify my question <comment228559> It's really not clear what you're asking. There are no user levels for iCloud. You either have an account (your Apple ID) or you don't. Also have no idea if you're referring to Mac, Windows or a device of some type. If you're asking, can I sign into my iCloud account from more than one account on my Mac, or more than one Mac, the answer is yes. Keep in mind what syncs through iCloud though (contacts, notes, etc) and disable anything you don't want changed.
