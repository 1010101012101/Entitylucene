Iterm2 disable Command shortcuts <body> I use strongIterm2/strong on the Mac. Many times, I accidentally press kbdCommand/kbd+some key, so I'm wondering, is it possible to disable the Command shortcuts? Like kbdCommand/kbd+kbdD/kbd for example, as I use emtmux/em for split panes.  <answer85541> You could just go to Preferences  Keys and manually delete every shortcut with kbdCmd/kbd.   <answer123813> You'll want to override iTerm's default shortcuts with your own shortcuts to "Ignore".  Go to codePreferences &gt; Key/code and press the + button at the bottom of the strongGlobal Shortcut Keys/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6NgF.png" alt="Global Shortcut Keys"  Then add an entry for kbdCmd/kbd+kbdK/kbd and choose "Ignore" for the action:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVcCF.png" alt="Entry for Cmd+K"  This disables kbdCmd/kbd+kbdK/kbd.  <comment98623> Those commands are not listed <comment144571> Please delete this answer. It is wrong and misleading. <comment144590> @Behrang we don't delete wrong answers for that reason alone. Can you explain he harm here or better, why exactly this is wrong. <comment144621> The `Preferences  Keys` panel does not contain an entry for Cmd+K so there's nothing to delete that can fix this issue.
