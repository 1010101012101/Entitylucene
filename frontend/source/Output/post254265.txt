Can you install a homebrew forumula without updating Xcode? <body> I am trying to install a homebrew formula, but it just tells me that I need to update Xcode. Everything worked correctly before and I can't install the update, first of all, my internet speed is very bad, and when I click update in the App Store it just says "waiting".  I tried reading the output of codebrew help/code and such but I couldn't find any "force" or similar option. Is it possible to do what I am trying to do?  <answer254267> I found the file which prevents me from installing anything. It is code/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/extend/os/mac/diagnostic.rb/code  What I did to solve this was commenting out lines 65-82 and then locking the file so it doesn't get overwritten.  <comment330692> How can I lock the file? <comment330738> @IndOubt Mark the file, click command + I, from there you can lock it by checking a box
