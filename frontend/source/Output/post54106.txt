How to execute a Folder Action or another Automator script when I make changes to a folder? <body> How to execute a Folder Action or another Automator script when I make changes to a folder? And by changes I mean not just deleting or inserting new file, the most important for me is when the content of a file is changed the action will be triggered.  <answer54121> Using launchd, you could save a property list like this in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and load it with something like codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/automator_test.plist/code or by logging out and back in.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;automator_test&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;              &lt;string&gt;automator&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/username/Desktop/Test.workflow&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/username/Desktop/&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;!-- run at most every 0 seconds, by default 10 --&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Launchd only detects changes to files when they are saved atomically (or deleted and recreated every time they are saved). Most OS X apps perform atomic saves, but for example TextMate and vim don't.  <answer54350> This kind of requirement goes beyond the simple codefsevents/code hooks exposed as Folder Actions. I’d recommend using Paul Kim’s Hazel, which will allow you to create “watch and react” rules of almost unlimited granularity and complexity.  <comment62025> I haven't tested it yet al test it when I get home. But will it make it automatically every time I save changes to a file inside the folder? I started to read something about launchctl not being the recommended app/service for that, but I cannot remember where I read it. <comment62060> I did that and nothing is happening <comment62067> I tested it again and it worked for me. Did you replace `username`? You have to `launchctl unload $path && launchctl load $path` to apply changes. <comment62068> Related questions: [Monitor a folder for changes, and run a command when a change is detected](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/40705/monitor-a-folder-for-changes-and-run-a-command-when-a-change-is-detected), [Checking for folder/file changes using Automator?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6658/checking-for-folder-file-changes-using-automator) <comment62167> Thank you, but, it doesn't work the way I want. It does what Folder Actions does, which is triggered if I insert, move or delete something inside the folder. I edited a HTML file inside the folder and nothing happened. And it is not recursive. <comment62221> You're right that it's not recursive, but it should be triggered when files are modified or files or folders are moved, deleted, or created. <comment103890> You have two awesome answers. Do either help you out?
