Add pdfs and epubs to iTunes 12 on MacOS Sierra <body> The answers to this question don't work for me on iTunes 12 and MacOS Sierra. I can open pdfs and epubs in iBooks, and do see them in the "Me" collection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7sfH2.jpg" alt="iBooks Library"  but when trying to sync them to the iPad, I can only see the ebooks downloaded on from the iBooks Store (I'm on iTunes 12.6.0.100 and Mac OS Sierra 10.12.4 using a Macbook Pro).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMFFa.png" alt="iTunes Library"  The iPad is configured to sync collections in its Settings.  What should I do?
