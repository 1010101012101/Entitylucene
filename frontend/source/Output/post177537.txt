How to schedule Mac software updates at a particular time in Yosemite? <body> I saw this helpful answer, but cannot find the Software Update.app file when I search for it on my Mac (Yosemite) to insert it into the iCal event.  So how can I schedule software updates on Yosemite?  <answer177545> How are you searching for it?  If in strongSpotlight/strong, don't. The strongSoftware Update.app/strong bundle is exactly where the reference states that is it!  Its fully qualified pathname is code/System/Library/CoreServices/Software Update.app/code and you can see it in strongFinder/strong by starting in the strongroot/strong of the strongMacintosh HD/strong or if in strongiCal/strong when selecting the file to open, make sure you start navigating to it from the strongroot/strong of the strongMacintosh HD/strong (or whatever the name of your HD is).  <comment210039> In Yosemite, the path specified in the helpful answer is correct: `/System/Library/CoreServices/Software Update.app`. I don't have iCal to test this, and Calendar.app doesn't seem to have the functionality. <comment210307> and another + from me for precise answer.
