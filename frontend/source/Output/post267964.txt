Using IFTTT to sync my Alexa ToDo and Shopping list with iOS reminders <body> So I have managed to setup an IFTTT applet to copy new todo's and Shopping list items from my Alexa to my Apple iOS reminders.  When I tried to create an option to remove them from Alexa (Todoist) when they were deleted the options to delete are not in the Alexa end of the app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gm6le.jpg" width="375"  <comment336311> IFTTT doesn't support that. Try contacting them to ask if they'll add deleting Alexa reminders
