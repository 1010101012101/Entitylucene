Problem with my applescript to export keynote files to powerpoint <body> I've a big problem with an export applescript. I would like to export many keynote files to powerpoint files. I found this script below, but there is an error that tells that the menu item "Exporter..." ("Export..." in English, my version is in french) doesn't exist. When I change "Exporter..." by "Fermer", it works very well!!!?  h2May you help me?/h2  below the script I've written:  precodeset thisFile to "/Users/kyou83/Documents/pépépé.key" tell application "System Events"     tell application "Keynote"         activate         open thisFile     end tell     tell process "Keynote"         click menu item "Exporter..." of menu of menu bar item "Fichier" of menu bar 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' And here the error description  error "Erreur dans System Events : Il est impossible d’obtenir menu item \"Exporter...\" of menu of menu bar item \"Partage\" of menu bar 1 of process \"Keynote\"." number -1728 from menu item "Exporter..." of menu of menu bar item "Partage" of menu bar 1 of process "Keynote"  <answer73141> I cannot believe how simple the answer was. Instead of three periods, i needed to use an ellipsis character in my string.   As I use the azerty keyboard (I'm french) you have to press alt;! to generate an ellipsis.   <comment84840> I don't have anything with Keynote installed to test, but try using the ellipsis character (…) rather than three dots. <comment89680> Christophe, if this is the answer, you should mark it.
