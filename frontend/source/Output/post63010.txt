My Mac does not recognize my Galaxy S2 trough USB <body> Snow Leopard: My Mac doesn't recognize my Samsung Galaxy S2 over USB, and it's starting to drive me nuts.   I've tried the following:  strongConnect Storage to PC/strong  codeSettings &gt; Wireless and Networks &gt; USB Utilities &gt; Connect Storage to PC/code  I've tried this several times on my phone, following the procedure stating that I should only connect after the phone asks me to, but it does not work.   There is no "attach-button" in the pull down menu, like some claim there should be. Yet it seems that the phone notices that the USB-cable is connected. However OS X does not.

That window can be handy to troubleshoot a hardware connection issue or at least let you know it's software. OS X can take a while to check attached storage to determine the filesystem status - so if the device is changing how it exposes itself to the system I could see it not mounting storage due to a timing issue. <comment72730> I have now.
