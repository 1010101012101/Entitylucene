DNS - Cannot connect to the internet <body> I think I have some sort of dns/proxy issues with my wifi settings. Many apps cannot connect to the internet: Firefox, Team viewer, Steam (works after 2 minutes). Chrome does connect but "Establishing secure connection" message for 30+ seconds on each website.  Currently using my default ISP DNS but also tried Google public DNS. Proxy protocol: Auto Proxy Discovery (tried on and off) &amp; Passive mode active.  I have cleared DNS cache multiple times, removed network multiple times and it only seems to be happening on this specific device: 2015 MBP Sierra.  Worth mentioning that this specific issue freezes my Mac for a good minute or so.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dU4Et.png" alt="enter image description here"  Anybody has any ideas regarding what is going on here? There is no proxy/dns settings on my router + it is a wireless connection.

How do `ping`  our `traceroute` behave? <comment329959> They are already off. <comment329961> @techraf I can't really think of anything else since I have no firewall or any security set on the router. Ping & traceroute results added.
