iPhone Dead, No Charger <body> Someone dropped their iPhone near my door. The neighbor picked it up, phoned me, and told me it has my number in it so it's probably someone I know.  But now, the phone is dead, and I don't have an iPhone charger to charge it. How can I turn this thing on?  <answer8881> Go to the nearest Apple store and ask to use one of their chargers. From my previous experiences, they are usually very helpful.  <answer8882> As popular as iDevices are I would think that you would be able to find someone with one that is close by... heck I can think of 5 people at work, off the top of my head plus myself...  <comment9431> If it was that easy, I wouldn't need to ask this question. <comment9485> @ashes999 Similarly go to any place (events, other stores, etc) prone to find apple folks (fans, employees, etc) and you'll most likely be able to borrow a charge for long enough.
