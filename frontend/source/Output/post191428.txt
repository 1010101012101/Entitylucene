Why does Find My iPhone need to be disabled before restoring an iPhone? <body> If I try to restore from iTunes, it tells me I have to turn off find my iPhone. Why is this so?  <answer191431> Disabling Find My iPhone is required because otherwise someone could steal a phone and wipe it, and the owner wouldn't be able to do anything about it. When you disable Find My iPhone, it requires your Apple ID and password.  <comment227507> If I answered your question, please mark it as an accepted answer.
