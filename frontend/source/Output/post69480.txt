Multiple languages for dictionary Look up in Spotlight <body> How can I handle several languages at the same time in Spotlight ?  When a word exists in several languages including english, Spotlight gives me results in english. I would like to have all the results.  For example, 'bras' means arm in french. But it's also the plural form of bra, an english noun. So I cannot find it with Spotlight unless I actually launch Dictionary from the Spotlight results and switch the language.   <answer69724> ⌃⌘D or tapping with three fingers doesn't work for some reason, but you can show a look up popover from the context menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/efyvA.png" alt=""
