What are 'com.apple.access_ssh' and 'com.apple.access_screensharing'; can I delete them? <body> When I examine the list of users and groups on my machine (OSX 10.9) with codeid/code I get:  precodeuid=501(Rax) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff)        103(Rax),        12(everyone),        61(localaccounts),        80(admin),        98(_lpadmin),        33(_appstore),        100(_lpoperator),        204(_developer),        398(com.apple.access_screensharing),        399(com.apple.access_ssh) /code/pre  I don't (currently) have any sharing enabled. What are the last two groups and where did they come from? Can I delete them; if so how?  hr  Using codesudo dscl  . -read /Groups/com.apple.access_ssh/code I get:  precodeAppleMetaNodeLocation: /Local/Default Comment:  SSH Service ACL GeneratedUID: XXX... NestedGroups: XXX... Password: * PrimaryGroupID: 399 RealName:  SSH Service ACL RecordName: com.apple.access_ssh RecordType: dsRecTypeStandard:Groups /code/pre  And using codesudo dscl  . -read /Groups/com.apple.access_screensharing/code I get:  precodeAppleMetaNodeLocation: /Local/Default Comment:  Screensharing Service ACL GeneratedUID: XXX... NestedGroups: XXX... Password: * PrimaryGroupID: 398 RealName:  Screensharing Service ACL RecordName: com.apple.access_screensharing RecordType: dsRecTypeStandard:Groups /code/pre  (Though I'm not sure what any of that means.)  <answer113823> The main admin user on my 10.9 VM is also part of both those groups, so I guess it's normal.     Tests-Mac:~ test$ idbr   uid=501(test) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),79(_appserverusr),80(admin),81(_appserveradm),98(_lpadmin),401(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1),33(_appstore),100(_lpoperator),204(_developer),398(com.apple.access_screensharing),399(com.apple.access_ssh)   Membership in the codecom.apple.access_screensharing/code group seems to correspond to the user (or a group it's a member of) being included in this list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nA6vj.png" alt=""  When I created a new standard account, it was not a member of the codecom.apple.access_screensharing/code group by default, but after I added the account to the list above, it became a member of the group.  Similarly, membership in the codecom.apple.access_ssh/code group seems to correspond to the user being included in the list in the Remote Login section.  <answer113847> I'll try to answer correctly to the 1st question (and not wait the delay I would need to make a correct answer to 2nd question).  What are the groups:  precode   398(com.apple.access_screensharing),    399(com.apple.access_ssh) /code/pre  for?  These groups are created to separate priviledges.  To be able to manage the access to the screen sharing setting, you just need to be in group code398/code. You don't need to be coderoot/code, you don't need to be in the group codewheel/code.  This is a good security policy. This priviledges separation is a real security improvment.  <comment133495> Why do you want to delete them in the first place? <comment133496> @patrix: That's what the "what are they" part of the question is about. Perhaps I don't. But I didn't have them before updating to 10.9 and migrating to a new machine, and they sure look like a way to access my machine remotely. <comment133497> Groups are used to control access permissions to files/folders, they can not be used to login. <comment133498> @patrix: So: I shouldn't delete them because there's no reason to might begin to answer the second part of the question. <comment133499> This site doesn't work too well with several questions asked at once (in one post). Can you edit your question to either ask "what are these groups for" *or* "can I safely delete them"? The first would probably result in better answers...
