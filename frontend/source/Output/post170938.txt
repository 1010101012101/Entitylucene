Are there USB-A to USB-C adapters for the Early 2015 MacBook <body> Apple announced a new 12" MacBook. The only port other than a headphone jack is USB-C. Since it is new technology I do not have any USB-C memory sticks.  What adapters will let older USB sticks work with this port and Mac?  <answer170939> Simple answer - yes.  Apple has also announced an USB-C to USB connector for Â£15 in the UK store or $19 in the US store.  ul liUSB-C to USB (UK Store)/li liUSB-C to USB (US Store)/li /ul  It too isn't shipping yet, so it's hard to know if this is a custom chip and design or any old "connect the wires" adapter will do the trick. However, my guess is that it's just a simple adapter and there's no licensing like the lightning port requires/allows.  The specifications are that the port is just USB 3.1 Gen 1 which means that pretty much any USB-A device in existance will interoperate with the new MacBook.  <comment207944> Forgive the large edit. I'll undelete my answer if you're not comfortable with the amount of change I introduced. <comment207998> @bmike - no worries at all. Both are/were correct at the time of writing ;) I see no reason to not keep it up to date & canonical.
