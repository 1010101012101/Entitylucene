How to manage my own reviews and ratings in Mac App Store? <body> Is there such an option in Mac App Store? I know in iTunes Store we can manage reviews and ratings in personal account.  <answer77076> Open the Mac App Store. On the Featured tab, in the right sidebar, there is a link called Account. Under Settings  Reviews and Ratings, click Manage. You can edit / delete your reviews there.  <comment89384> It works. Thanks. <comment199922> Not any more... I don't see anywhere I can view or manage my reviews. Disturbing, so I'll stop reviewing apps.
