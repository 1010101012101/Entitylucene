Can't run Intel Driver Update Utility on OS X <body> I cannot run the Intel Driver Update Utility on OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.5). All Java options are enabled (have tested in Safari, Firefox and Chrome) and latest Java version installed. It keeps saying "Loading…" until a message pops up saying…     The Intel Driver Update Utility failed. Possible web browser compatibility, firewall or installation issue detected. Select OK to troubleshoot the issue.   Any ideas?  supPS: I don't use any other firewall software other than the OS included one./sup  <answer102608> Unfortunately the Intel Drivers Utility does not work with Mac OS.
