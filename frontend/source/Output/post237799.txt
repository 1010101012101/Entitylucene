Delete last word using Command + Backspace <body> Is there a setting to delete the last word using the command key and backspace?  Currently this combination of keys deletes the current line. Instead, I want to delete the last word (before the cursor).  How can I do that emnatively/em (without any other apps, if possible)? Is there a terminal command to run or maybe an option somewhere?  In the terminal I use kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdw/kbd, but I'm interested how to do that in UI apps (browser, and other non-terminal applications).  <answer237800>    Option-Delete&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete the word to the left of the insertion point.   Have a look at the Document shortcuts section in: Mac keyboard shortcuts  <comment291438> Oh, that works! Thanks :) <comment291458> Can you take a look at [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/237805/87092), too? Thanks! <comment291467> @Ionică Bizău, I looked at your other question. I normally do not use that feature and having just now tested it, it is only working sporadically on my system running OS X 10.8.5. So there's not really any help I can offer, sorry.
