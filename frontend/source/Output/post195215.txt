Connect MacBook Pro to two external monitors <body> Is there a way to connect my MacBook Pro to two external monitors (either VGA or HDMI; no Thunderbolt) in such a way that the Mac screen serves as a third monitor?  What hardware do I need?  <answer195222> Yes, there is a way, in fact I have my rMBP connected to a monitor right now via HDMI.  Firstly, I suggest HDMI, because that's what I have and it works well for me. :)  ol liConnect the Macbook (from now on, MB) to the monitors./li liOpen up System Preferences./li liSelect Displays (2nd row, 1st item). 3a. You will be greeted with a window for each monitor img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uw2Wi.png" alt="This is monitor" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3eZ6K.png" alt="This is MB"/li liSelect Arrangement for the MB window (2nd tab)/li liTurn off Mirror Displays  5a. If you ever want to mirror on a whim, turn on "Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available"./li liArrange your monitors using the blue rectangles. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQwq3.png" alt="This is how mine is set up."/li /ol  I hope this answers your question!  <answer195224> To get a three screen setup (two external screens, and laptop screen) connected without daisy chaining Thunderbolt displays, you need:  ul liOne external monitor hooked up to the Mini DisplayPort/li liOne external monitor hooked up from USB to DVI/li /ul  I am assuming you already have the first item taken care of as it is the easiest.  So, let's focus on the second one:  You need something like the Diamond BVU195 HD USB 2.0 to VGA / DVI / HDMI Adapter.  This will give you your "display adapter" for your second external monitor.  Now, you would set your primary monitor the same way you would in a dual monitor setup.   This article from OS X Daily details it nicely.  When you disconnect, as was mentioned in one of the comments above, your main display will revert back to the laptop screen.  That's it.  You're done.  But if you want to see this working, check out this YouTube Video.  Enjoy!  <comment233056> The internal screen is always going to revert to being primary, if the others are disconnected. For Hardware, try Google <comment233065> So you want to know which hardware to use and how to use the mac displyay as another monitor? I mean, set one of the external displays as the main one? <comment233102> It really does not matter to me if it is the main or secondary. As long as it behaves the same as in My Linux's Gnome desktops. <comment233103> cool - thanks Will try that
