connect Windows 8 client to Mac OS X Server Fileshare <body> I want to connect a Windows 8 Client to a SMB fileshare on a OS X Server 10.9. With OS X I have no problems, but I don't know what I have to do to get the Windows client connected.  <answer189630> It seems that your Windows 8 Client is using SMBv3 but your 10.9 Server is using SMBv2. There is a Tech-Note on the Microsoft-Support Site (see here) which suggests disabling the Security-Negotiation Settings, f.e. either manually set the required flag in the Registry:  precode"HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters"  RequireSecureNegotiate -Value 0 -Force /code/pre  or running the following command in the PowerShell:  precodeSet-SmbClientConfiguration -RequireSecuritySignature $true /code/pre  <comment224934> Did you get an error Message on the Client or Server? If so, please post it. <comment224935> try http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/152906/85275
