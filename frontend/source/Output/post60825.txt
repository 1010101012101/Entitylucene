Safari not working with notification center <body> I have a new macbook pro with mountain lion. I want to use the notification center for my Facebook/gmail, but when I'm logged into both facebook and gmail, I never get alerts.I have safari available in my notification center, but it won't work. What do I do?  <answer60827> When you go to Gmail in Safari 6, you should see this at the top:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/25ker.png" alt="enter image description here"  That should enable alerts in Notification Center. You could also set up your Gmail in Mail.app.  On Apple's website for Mountain Lion, it says:     Facebook integration coming this fall.   So it may be a few weeks still before you can use Facebook with Notification Center.  <comment70076> If you won't see the desktop notifications banner you could go to settings to enable them.
