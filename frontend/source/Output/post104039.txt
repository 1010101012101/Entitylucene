What is answering at port 80 when httpd is down? <body> Since OS X Lion, web sharing isn't available from the System preferences.   So I shut it down using codesudo apachectl stop/code. Doing this, codehttp://localhost/~Username/code doesn't answer any more and all codehttpd/code are down (a least codeps -e | grep httpd/code return none of them).    But using my browser codehttp://localhost/code still returns a "It works!". Who then is answering at port 80 ?   <answer104040> Nothing. Your browser is likely returning a cached response. Try Shift+Reload or clear your cache and reload. Then, you should see no response.   <comment122537> yeah ... I don't how I could oversee that.
