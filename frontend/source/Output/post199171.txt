Restart Apple Airport Extreme from the terminal? <body> Can one restart an Aiport Extreme from the terminal? If so, how?   <comment238590> Possible duplicate [Restart airport router via command line](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/102317/120171) But no accepted answer. <comment239944> Don't believe the question has been answered, someone needs to dig through the Ubuntu Airport Util code and find out how to do this.
