Applications eats a space in iPhone <body> Let me explain so my problem would be imaginable. I have photos made in standard Camera app. I need to upload them from my iPhone to a cloud service. I'm using Flickr for images. Also, I've tried Google Drive - the problem is the same. So, I uploaded a bulk of photos from "Photos" to Flickr via Flickr's app on iPhone. After I've sured they are uploaded - I delete that photos from iPhone locally. But the disk space in iPhone didn't freed. :( I've checked "Usage" statistics and have seen that Flickr's size was increased +2GB. So, I don't have photos locally but Fluckr ate the same space.  I've tried Google Drive. I did the upload of two videos, and delete them after. Drive's space increased for 500MB.  I don't know what should I do for free the space on iPhone. Now I have less than 1GB, and need to free some space. Please help me to find a good solution.  <comment168710> Delete the app and reinstall it in order to clear its cache. I do this fairly regularly for Facebook. <comment168711> @aglasser, if I will do that - shouldn't I loose the content I uploaded to Flickr's cloud? I think no, I won't. Because all I have uploaded are there, already. And deletion won't erase anything at that side. Am I right? <comment168713> They are visible on another machine from Flickr, correct? They're saved to Flickr's servers, not just on your phone. You will lose no data that is saved to Flickr. <comment170553> @aglasser, could you repeat your post as an answer? I'll mark it as the solution, and this question will be closed.
