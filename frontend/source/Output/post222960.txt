Preventing 13-year-old from downloading apps previously downloaded <body> My 13-year-old had an Apple ID before family sharing was available. In the span of a few days he had downloaded a bunch of messaging apps on his iPhone that we, the parents, do not approve of. We deleted them and instituted family sharing (to require approval of app downloads), but it still allows him to download these deleted apps because he had downloaded them before.    How can I clear out the previously downloaded apps so if he tries to download them again it will require him to "ask to buy?"  Also, there are some downloads that are on his phone that I believe he found a way around family sharing.  Is this possible? How can you prevent it?   <answer225353> If you control the Apple ID with which the apps have been downloaded, you can hide bought things from the list of 'previously purchased' apps, however I don't think that it also disables the download button if you go these apps' product pages directly.  <comment270212> As far as I am aware, you can't "disown" apps after they are already owned, which is the case for your son. The only easy way that I can think of is deleting his account, and then giving him a new one. I don't really think there is an easy way around family sharing; maybe he had the apps before? Also, in order to prevent the use of certain apps, there is a feature in IOS called restrictions. I would suggest checking it out.
