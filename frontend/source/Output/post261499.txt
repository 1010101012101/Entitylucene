Install my ATI graphics card in Parallels <body> I installed parallels 11 on my iMac and installed windows on it. Then I'm trying to install my ATI card on windows so I can install the Catalyst manager as I want to disable the anti-aliasing option as shown here and here, and to do so I need to have the Catalyst control centre installed. So I want to have the Catalyst control centre installed, Any suggestions please?

Even if you did, it would only disable AA in Windows, not in the Mac.br You might have a better chance in Boot Camp, as at least you can install the drivers to that.  Alternatively, did you try just disabling font smoothing in System Prefs  General ?  <comment327579> Thanks for your answer. Would it work if I installed Vmare fusion instead of parallels?
