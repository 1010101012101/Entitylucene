How to undo window always on top? <body> While I'm just switching to codeTerminal/code window using codeCmd + Tab + Up/code my codeTerminal/code window started floating on top of all other windows. I am unable to bring it down. I've tried codeCmd + Tab + Down/code but didn't work.  <comment282937> That's not a standard Mac control key-combo - in fact I know of no way to permanently float a window from OS X, natively. Standard for Cmd/Tab/Up would be to bring the tabbed-to window to the front, Mission Control-style.  Esc or click would return to standard view, with that window at the front [but not locked on top] <comment283259> Its a bug. I couldn't do it again with any of the windows. I couldn't reproduce the bug again even after several trials.
