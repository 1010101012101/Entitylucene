Disk space lost after quitting disk partition <body> My MacBook Pro came with a 500 GB hard disk, and I used about 250 GB. I was trying to get a new logic partition using the OSX disk utility, and then my Mac Book Pro froze and I had to quit the Disk Utility.   Then the available space just disappeared.   ul liDisk Utility shows that the stronglogic partition/strong has a total capacity of 498.88 GB, available 10.48 GB, used 243.75 GB, which does not add up./li liDisk Utility shows that the stronghard drive/strong has a total capacity of 499.25 GB, available 19 MB, used 499.23 GB./li lirunning codedf -h/code shows   precodeFilesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on  /dev/disk1     237Gi  227Gi  9.8Gi    96%   59509256      2559899 96%   / /code/pre/li /ul  Things I have tried:  ul liall check and repair functions in Disk Utility/li licodefsck -f/code /li lireboot and cmd+R and open the command line  tool, but I cannot mount /dev/disk0 with code-t hfs/code.

Core Storage volumes are built after enabling File Vault 2, creating a Fusion Drive or often after updating to Yosemite.  If you don't have a second internal hard disk attached, disk0 is usually mounted to /. In your case disk1 is mounted to / which is a typical hint for Core Storage Volume Group - in case of an internal Fusion Drive disk2 is mounted to / and disk0 and disk1 usually don't appear entering codedf -h/code.  Open Terminal and enter codediskutil cs list/code to get all CoreStorage objects in a tree-like view.  Use this comprehensive list of documented and undocumented commands to manipulate your CoreStorage Volume Group.  <comment214671> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0`, `diskutil list` and `diskutil cs list` to your question.
