Unable to set Photos system library <body> I moved my Photos library to an external drive due to it's size.  I removed ~/Pictures/Photos Library.  When I launch Photos it asks to choose library.  I select "Other Library" and traverse to external drive where I select the photo library I moved.  Everything works as expected.  I then choose Photos preferences and and select "Use as System Photo Library".    The next time I launch Photos it cannot find the library and I have to go through the above sequence again.  I removed ~/Library/Prefernces/com.apple.Photos.plist and redid the procedure above.  When I check com.apple.Photos.plist it has the path to the external library.  Yet when I launch Photos it again says it can't find ~/Pictures/Photos Library.  Any recommendations what to try next?  <answer268553> This might be simpler using EasyFind from the App Store [freeware]  A search [including invisibles] for codeapple.photos/code immediately after launching Photos holding kbd Opt ‚å• /kbd, then quitting, shows several modified files, including   code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Photos/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Photos.savedState/codebr code/private/var/folders/nc/c83zpk8x7kd9qrxrd3nnbfym0000gn/T/com.apple.Photos.librarychooserservice/code  It might be useful [after making sure you have a good backup] to test out some of those. SavedState is always a prime candidate for this type of thing, I'm less sure about the chooserservice, but it sounds apropos.  <comment337431> I renamed ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Photos to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.bPhoto.  Then when I launch Photos it is pointing correctly to the external drive.  In looking at the contents of com.apple.Photo there is a directory Data that contains links to ../../../../Pictures.  My guess is this is what was causing issue.  When launched Photos it did not create com.apple.Photos. This must not be needed as Photos is working fine.
