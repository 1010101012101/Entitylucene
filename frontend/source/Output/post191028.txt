Removing a specific app from spotlight <body> I use codetextWrangler/code for all my text editing needs.  I abhor codetextEdit/code.  The problem comes when I search spotlight if I stop at codetext/code and hit codeenter/code then codetextEdit/code will launch.  I want to remove codetextEdit/code from my spotlight without deleting the app itself.  I know I can keep a folder from being indexed.  But I want a specific app/file to not be included.  And I know the simple answer is just "don't type codetext/code".  But that isn't really an answer.  I don't want to think to type.  <answer191032> At least on Yosemite, it looks to me like Spotlight should learn by what you select. So that if you start typing codetext/code it will list several possible matches. For me it listed:  ol liSublime Text 3/li liTextEdit/li liTextWrangler/li /ol  Indicating Spotlight knows my preference for Sublime. I tried selecting TextWrangler instead, and on subsequent searches, TextWrangler was the first item.   Additionally, you could type codetw/code to more specifically request codeTextWrangler/code  emNote: I have used LaunchBar.app because it has always had these types of features. I think that I may have used LB during Mac OS X 10.0 BETA.  I still use many of LaunchBar's advanced features, but when I am on someone else Mac, I find I get along quite well with just Spotlight./em  <answer191034> You could move the emtextEdit/em application to an another folder (it can be a folder inside the emApplications/em folder).  Then you add this folder under the emPrivacy/em tab in Spotlight preferences (inside emSystem Preferences/em. You add the folder by clicking on the "+" in the emPrivacy/em tab and choosing the folder you placed emtextEdit/em in (it is also possible to drag-and-drop the folder into the emPrivacy/em tab).  Now Spotlight should exclude emtextEdit/em (and all other files/applications placed in that folder) from future searches.  If you need some screenshots on how to do this, please refer to this article: Link to article .  <answer191038> Couldn't you just type "wrang" instead?  Also, third party replacements like LaunchBar or Alfred would let you define what results appear first when you type your choice of text. These also let you blacklist some search results.  <answer191049> Yes, you can exclude a specific application from strongSpotlight/strong search results from its strongPrivacy/strong pane in OS X Yosemite.  Along with strongTextEdit/strong I have strongTextWrangler/strong and strongSublime Text 2/strong installed under OS X Yosemite.  If in strongSpotlight/strong I type strongtext/strong the listed order is:  ul liTextEdit/li liTextWrangler/li liSublime Text 2/li /ul  If I go to strongSystem Preferences  Spotlight  Privacy/strong and drag and drop the strongTextEdit/strong application bundle onto the list area of the strongPrivacy/strong pane and close strongSystem Preferences/strong and go back to strongSpotlight/strong and type strongtext/strong the listed order is now:  ul liTextWrangler/li liSublime Text 2/li /ul  So, just do as I did and it solves your issue.  <comment227033> I *would* downvote, but don't have enough reputation, because I already addressed this very issue: `And I know the simple answer is just "don't type text". But that isn't really an answer. I don't want to think to type.` in my original question. <comment227035> Thank you, I didn't realize I could add specific apps to it.  And all of the other spotlight related questions I read either didn't suggest it or I didn't see this. <comment311632> Nice! This ability is hidden because it only works by drag & drop; clicking the "+" button won't pick an app. And it seems more important lately (due to El Capitan?) since Spotlight randomly promotes choices I don't use (like Launchpad) over the choices I do use (Lightroom). <comment331821> I found that I couldn't select the apps themselves, so it seemed like it wasn't possible. But I was able to drag them and drop them into the little sliver of the Privacy pain that wasn't blocked by the file picker window, and it worked. <comment348307> Spotlight takes a few minutes to update. <comment348338> @Robino, You said, "_Spotlight takes a few minutes to update._", and while that may have been true for you nonetheless, on my system the change appeared to be instantaneous. That is to say, it only took the time for me to close System Preferences and type the query in Spotlight and the results of the change was displayed immediately. That said, it's not unusual for timings to be different for everyone, as it depends on what else is is being processed on ones system at the time. <comment348543> @user3439894 Tested by dragging QuickTime in and out of Spotlight/Privacy on my late2012MBP13/Yosemite it was instant and I didn't even have to close System Preferences. On my 2016MBP15/Sierra it took a few minutes. Not sure how helpful the "may have been true" comment is -- every personal experience one reads about on the internet needs to be taken with a pinch of salt, unless they're by myself, in which case they are, of course, infallible.
