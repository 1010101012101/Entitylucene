Fine to keep macbook on power for unlimited time? <body> I just got a used Macbook Pro (retina) 2012 running El Capitan. I am keeping it charged and on all the time. Is there any harmful effect from doing so on the battery in the long term?  <answer236761> Technically no, there is no damage done to it. But it is still smart to let it unplug and fully drain the power to keep it in tip-top shape.   <answer236766> There is no harm in leaving your battery plugged in - your MacBook Pro will directly use the power adapter for its power needs. However, Apple (used to) recommend unplugging the battery occasionally - strong"An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing."/strong  There are other ways to improve your battery life, such as keeping it out of extreme cold and heat, and always updating to the latest Mac OS.

There do not seem to be any specific instructions for keeping it plugged in. <comment289828> @Bob Rogers That's your answer, right there.
