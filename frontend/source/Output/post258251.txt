Open a link in new tab in Safari on macOS Sierra <body> Before macOS Sierra I could open new link with kbdcommand/kbd-click in Safari. It doesn't work anymore.  What's the shortcut in macOS Sierra?  <answer258253> ⌘-click works fine for me in Safari under macOS sierra 10.12.  Check that strong⌘-click opens a link in a new tab/strong is checked under: Safari  Preferences...  Tabs  If it's checked and not working, uncheck it and close Safari. Then Open Safari and check it. Does it work now?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A9FY2.png" alt="Safari &gt; Preferences... &gt; Tabs"
