How do I get rid of my encrypted iPhone backups to start from scratch? <body> Is there a way I can delete all my encrypted iPhone backups for which I forgot the password, so that I can start backing up from fresh?   At the moment I'm stuck in this loop (below) which I can't seem to exit  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfLsm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   <answer88952> To delete the backups, go to iTunesPreferencesDevices. All iPhone backups will be listed here. Highlight them, then hit Delete.   But if you're using a Mac, I would first try to see if you can find the password in your Keychain (from discussions.apple.com):     ul   liGo to the "keychain access " app./li   liUnder "Keychains" select "Login"/li   liUnder "Category" select "Passwords"/li   liScroll down and look for "iPhone Backup"/li   liDouble click and a window opens/li   liCheck the box that says "Show Password"/li   liA window pops up asking for your OS X account password/li   liType in that password and voila!/li   /ul   <answer89767> Change your iPhone backup settings and start backing up to iCloud instead. You can do that either via iTunes on your Mac or if the password window is preventing you from doing so do it from your iPhone by navigating to Settings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup  iCloud Backup ON.   The next time you connect your iPhone to iTunes, the iTunes backups should be gone along with the message asking for your password.   Once you effectuate a full iOS backup to the iCloud, you can revert back to making backups with iTunes instead.  <comment104228> I've edited your question to put more focus on your issue with getting a backup going again at all. Feel free to revert the edit or change it if I got something wrong. <comment104410> thanks, ive tried going through keychain access, with no luck, i did manage to delete the backups, but when i go back into itunes the above screen is still the same, and locked to encrypt the backup, again needed a pw to unlock it <comment149827> Does that delete the iCloud backups? <comment152480> Nope, reverting back to iTunes backup does not delete the iCloud backups made.
