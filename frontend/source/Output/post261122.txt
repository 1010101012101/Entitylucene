Special considerations for bonding for direct p2p on separate subnet? <body> I would like to combine 2 GbE ports on macOS 10.12.1 between two computers on a separate subnet from the regular LAN in order to facilitate faster data sharing between two machines.  Are there any special considerations in doing this or will standard bonding techniques work (e.g., https://superuser.com/a/566556/103907)?
