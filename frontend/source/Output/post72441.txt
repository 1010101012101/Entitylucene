Hide/Show menu bar similar to dock? <body> Do you know if it is possible to hide/show the menu bar similar to the Dock? I found about Menu Eclipse , but I think you can't use the menu bar space, and additionally it costs $1.99. Do you know other alternatives?  <answer212705> As of OS X 10.11 (El Capitan), this functionality is built in to the operating system. Go to SystemÂ Preferences  General  and turn on "Automatically hide and show the menu bar."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P1DpL.png" alt=""  <comment84196> Related questions: [5064](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5064/how-can-i-hide-my-top-menu-bar-on-mac-os-x), [53724](http://superuser.com/questions/53724/auto-hide-os-x-menu-bar), [68759](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/68759/hide-application-menu-bar)
