Custom label is now missing <body> The 'Custom Label' in Contacts is now gone missing on my iPhone 5c, how do I restore this label to my contacts?  <answer225702> I think the emCustom Label/em field is only visible for contacts on GMail, as opposed to on iCloud. Go to strongSettings &rarr; Mail Contacts, Calendars &rarr; Contacts / Default Account/strong and set it to your gmail account. For the contacts you create now, they'll be saved on GMail and the emCustom Label/em field will be available.
