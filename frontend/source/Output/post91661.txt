Macbook won't sync contacts over to iPhone 3G <body> I just got a iPhone 3G and tried to sync it with the macbook air with mountain lion via iTunes.  The funny thing is, all the music and apps were able to be "synced" but only the contacts wasn't be able to.  Any ideas how to troubleshoot?  More info: Jailbroken iPhone 3G iTunes 11.0.3 Syncing contacts using the contacts built-in  Thanks!  <comment107669> Did you receive an error message or did the contacts simply not transfer to the device? <comment107680> Nope, I did not receive any error message.  It synced successfully.  I saw "syncing contacts" for like 2 seconds, though.
