iPhone auto brightness <body> I reset the settings (all settings) on my new iPhone 5 today, to try to troubleshoot some problem. Since doing so, my screen seems dimmer.   I never changed the brightness settings to begin with, from opening the factory-sealed box up until the reset, so I am not sure why this seems to be the case. The auto-brightness seems to be using a lower intensity for any given lighting condition since the reset.  Am I just imagining things, or is this possible?  <answer66112> You probably are just imagining things, unless dirt has been obstructing your ambient light sensor and beside resetting your settings, you cleaned it too.  <comment77867> Where is the sensor? I use a microfiber cloth and a drop of camera lens cleaner to wipe down the front every night.
