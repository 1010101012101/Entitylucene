Cannot erase and reformat Mt Lion on Mac Book Pro <body> I am trying to strongerase and reformat/strong my mac book pro.  It has strongmt lion/strong installed already.  I have a usb w mt lion ready to go.  When I go through the erase steps in the disk utility, the erase button remains grey, so I cannot erase the OS.    I go into strongdisk utility/strong, I click the hard drive I want, I click strongerase/strong, the format window (Mac OS Extended) remains grey.  The 'strongname/strong' bar is 'untitled', and I cannot change it.  The 'strongerase/strong' button at the bottom left remains grey, I cannot erase.    What to do.  John  <answer117915> You have to boot off another drive before you can erase your internal hard drive.  Boot off your external USB drive and then you should be able to erase the internal one.  <answer117919> You should boot from the recovery partition, to format the internal hard drive.  To boot from the recovery partition, hold the kbdoption/kbd key immediately after you turn the computer on.  You will see two drive icons on the screen ... one for your internal hard drive, and the other for the recovery partition.  Choose the recovery partition, and from there, you can run Disk Utility.
