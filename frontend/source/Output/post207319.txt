Spotlight not connecting to internet <body> My problem is that Spotlight shows no results from internet sources (Wikipedia, iTunes Store, etc.).  I've reindexed my drive twice, cleared all the caches, and reset the NVRAM.  Still not working.  I have everything in Spotlight preferences checked.  But when I search for a stock there's no results.  Funny thing is, if I try it in Safari it works just fine.  What's going on?  The output of codelaunchctl list | grep Spotlight/code is  code  465    0   com.apple.metadata.SpotlightNetHelper  466    0   com.apple.Spotlight /code  This might be a duplicate of the following question question, but there's still not a satisfactory answer (and that question asks about Yosemite, not El Capitan):  ul liSpotlight does not show contents from internet!/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0MQRR.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oLP19.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wWomE.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e50NM.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m6Jiq.png" alt=""  <comment251171> Same here. Identical configuration running El Capitan GM. Every time I try, i see this message in Console: Spotlight[318]: XPC connection was invalidated <comment256286> In `Terminal.app` what is the output of this command: `launchctl list | grep Spotlight` <comment256532> @l'L'l updated. <comment257311> @codetheweb: The results of the command shows that the Spotlight helper processes do seem to be running (which is normal). You could possibly try to `launchctl unload` then `launchctl load` each of those processes which would essentially restart them. Also, which country are you in? The reason I ask is that can affect the ability of Spotlight to do internet searches. <comment257440> @l'L'l I just updated yesterday, and it seems to be fixed.  Not sure what happened.  Thanks for your help. <comment257457> @codetheweb: Likely a bug of some sort, glad you got it working again :) cheers!
