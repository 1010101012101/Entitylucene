Is there a way to play Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force on a modern Mac? <body> I have a mid-2010 (Intel) MacBook Pro, and I’m nostalgic for emStar Trek Voyager: Elite Force/em, which was released in the early 2000s (!). At some point there was a freely-downloadable Carbon version to allow people who already owned the game to play it under then-current versions of Mac OS X, but as far as I know there hasn’t been any development recently. Can anyone think of some way I might be able to get the game running again?  <answer32293> Running Snow Leopard in a virtual machine will run PPC and some carbon apps on a Lion Mac.   You can also install Snow Leopard onto another drive (external or partition) and boot to 10.6 I that's all you need for that app.   <comment36999> Did your computer ship with Lion or Snow Leopard? What version of the OS is it currently running? <comment37003> It shipped with 10.6.3 and is running 10.7.2 now. (I said this was a mid-2011 model, but it was mid-2010—fixed now.)
