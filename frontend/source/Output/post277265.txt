How do I scale down a video without cropping? <body> The title mainly says it all. I've been looking for a tool to resize a video just by scaling it down. The only options I find when googling is for cropping video but I don't want to do that. I just want to scale a video down.  <answer277274> HandBrake is a free open-source video conversion utility, which in my opinion, is a must-have app.  It has built in presets for video conversion all of which are customizable.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/84VYg.png" alt="enter image description here"  At the bottom of the attached image, you can see the original video dimensions and the scaled down video dimensions of the conversion  You can create a custom preset and enter your own dimensions  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9uUZk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment349006> What video editing software are you using? <comment349008> I have iMovie and QuickTime but I'm willing to use any other free software <comment349015> Ahh ok, I'll try it.
