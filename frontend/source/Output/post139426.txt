Apple Map App for use as GPS on my iPad air. Do not have iPhone <body> Will the Apple Map app operate with only a GPS antenna linked to my I Pad Air?  <answer139458> You could always try Google maps, it should work. br Apple maps should work with your iPad air if you have 3G/4G/cellular data/wifi.  <comment164433> Will Google Maps read GPS data from an external GPS antenna? <comment164434> So you want to attach an external GPS receiver (which model) to your iPad and have a map app taking location data from the receiver to display the current location?
