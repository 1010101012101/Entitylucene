My keyboard input is strange (multilingual on Sierra) <body> br I'm a multilingual user and I have 6 keyboard inputs on my MacBook Air (macOS Sierra 10.12.5). br They are American, Japanese (two, for different kinds of letters), Chinese (3rd party), Greek (for typing economic symbols), and I'm learning Hungarian recently. br br Here's the problem:br Mostly every time I end my Japanese typing and switch to whatever language, all I can type is still Japanese letters (with a strange yellow background colour). br This is fine, weirdly, with Greek input although I still have that yellow background, and have to press return to finish my typing. In all other languages (obviously they are all typed with Latin letters) I get this kind of thing: (I was typing "history" with American keyboard)br br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GftzX.png" alt="Me trying to type &quot;history&quot;" br br And this could last for hours or a whole day, until it fixes somehow by itself, and me worriedly waiting for the next time.br I have tried Google Japanese input toolbox, and the same thing also happened repeatedly. br  br You may be interested that this could be related to the number of languages. It became far more frequent after I added the Hungarian keyboard some days ago. Before, it was several times a week, now it happens in almost every hour, in every application that I use everyday (including Adobe Acrobat). br br This Mac is my only computer for the moment, and I really appreciate it if anyone can help me out.br br UPDATE:br The problem happened again after I deleted the 3rd party Chinese IM.   <comment362673> If you are switching via keyboard shortcut, make sure siri is turned off and it's shortcut set to none and see if the problem persists. <comment362674> Try deactivating your 3rd party IM and see if that makes a difference. <comment362863> @TomGewecke Thanks, but I never used Siri, and it's turned off. <comment362866> @TomGewecke You are right about the 3rd party IM. I have raised the issue to the developer. Thanks again! <comment362887> It might be useful to others having similar problems. if you would name the 3rd party chinese IM.  I have a list of them at  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2017/05/macos-alternative-input-methods-for.html <comment362936> @TomGewecke Sadly it was not only the 3rd party IM. (The name is Rime, the first on your list and I really love it.) The problem happened again just after I made that comment with Apple Chinese IMâ€¦ Maybe I should post on Apple community.
