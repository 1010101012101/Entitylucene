org.postfix.master - Service exited with abnormal code: 1 <body> I've googled a lot on this issue, yet still seem to have found nothing that quite matches my situation.  Initially, I saw a lot of this error in main Console, repeating every 10 seconds  precode08/04/2015 19:11:11.102 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (org.postfix.master[1129]) Service exited with abnormal code: 1 08/04/2015 19:11:21.198 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (org.postfix.master) Service only ran for 1 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 9 seconds. /code/pre  I have found a lot… a lot.. of tweaks &amp; fixes for this, but combined with this error in code/var/log/mail/code  precodepostfix/master[***]: fatal: bind fe80::1 port 25: Can't assign requested address /code/pre  I could find nothing except references to Mac OS Server &amp; the codeinet_interfaces/code structure.  I'm running regular Yosemite on a Mac Pro 3,1 - no server structure at all on here.  From my 'not geeky enough to qualify' perspective, it looks like it's trying to find some kind of IPv6 connection yet failing...  <answer180071> Thanks to Postfix not working on MacOS Yosemite I managed to find the solution…  I tweaked my hosts file from    precodefe80::1%lo0    localhost   /code/pre  to    precodefe80::1%lo0    127.0.0.1   /code/pre  &amp; the 9 second respawn has vanished.
