Do not reopen windows/applications when battery down <body> When my battery of my laptop is empty, my computer falls out. It first tries to dump memory to the SSD in order to reload from there the next time. However, sometimes this fails and it has to do a clean start. When it does that, OS X somehow remembers what applications were open when the battery was "empty" and reopens every single application. Which is strongnot/strong what I want.  I'm totally fine with the failure of dumping all memory before the voltage is really to low to work on, but I don't like it having reopening the application when it does so. It takes over 3 minutes of 100% cpu usage sometimes before everything is opened. (Yes, I have a lot of applications running often.) Before it's done opening everything, my laptop is completely unusable.  Any advice?  I already checked "Close windows when quitting an app". (Which doen't work in this scenario because I didn't quit the app, since the battery was empty.)
