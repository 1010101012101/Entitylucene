Could that be related in any way to this keyboard issue? <comment218333> Electric pole struck by lighting , lights went off so does the mac , after rebooting mac , unable to detect keyboard and mouse + dead USB <comment218339> might be more than a dead USB, try running the Hardware Test <comment218363> How I supposed to do that with out keyboard and mouse <comment218516> Catch 22 then.
