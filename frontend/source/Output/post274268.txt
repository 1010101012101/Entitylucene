MAMP nginx.conf - invalid number of arguments in "user" <body> I am having issues starting up Nginx with the MAMP Pro application.  When I press start Nginx I get the following error message  precodeinvalid number of arguments in "user" directive in /Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/conf/nginx.conf:7 /code/pre  looking at the configuration file      /Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/conf/nginx.conf   I notice the following line has multiple users  precodeuser rob COMPANYWORKDOMAIN\Domain Users; /code/pre  However changing it to just one user (rob) does not work because it gets overwritten and reverted back next time I start up Nginx via the MAMP application.  I'm a  bit stuck as what to do here?  <answer274734> Your host is part of the domain COMPANYWORKDOMAIN and user emrob/em is a domain user (probably admin, network, managed) but no local admin user.  nginx.conf line 7 is determined by the "Run server as:" settings in MAMP Pro and mustn't be edited manually:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yx9ZI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Since your user is no local admin account using emrob/em will fail.  So either use the standard emUnix users/em (www/www) or a local admin account (which requires to log out as emrob/em and log in as another local admin user) to run MAMP Pro:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wOpwD.png" alt="enter image description here"
