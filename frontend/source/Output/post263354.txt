Unable to boot Mac Pro in recovery mode <body> My Mac Pro is Early 2009 4,1 and I'm trying to boot it in recovery mode so I can follow the steps of flashing it to 5,1.  I'm running El Capitan 10.11.6.  My keyboard is directly connected to the chassis via USB.  Unfortunately, doing cmd + R at boot chime doesn't lead me to the recovery screen.   Instead I get the usual Apple logo and progress bar.  Then, screens go black and the system cycles again (fans do their thing) and I come to a gray screen with several languages saying "my system shut down because of a problem etc...".  If I wait or press a key, this takes me to the login screen, which has my user name and picture and I login as usual.  Some pop-ups show in the login process asking me if I want to open previously open windows/programs.  This same sequence occurs when I use cmd + opt + R.  Any ideas how I can troubleshoot?  <comment329952> CCC (Carbon Copy Cloner) can check for valid Recovery Partition. (On phone, so self-googling reqd;-) <comment329968> thanks -- CCC says that an "El Capitan Recovery HD partition is already associated with the volume". What now? <comment329987> Will it allow you to delete/recreate it, or create new on another HD? (Still away from puter, so can't test)
