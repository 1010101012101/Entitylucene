Restoring an OLD iPhone backup <body> I recently made a full backup of my iPhone 4S to my computer. I was having some issues with it so I when into DFU mode and did a clean install.  Unfortunately as soon as iTunes finished installing iOS 6, it automatically made a full back-up of my phone, and I now can't see the previous back-up I made. Please tell me it's still there!  Thanks.  <answer95005> You can see all backups in Itunes settings - backup I think it keeps two or three latest backups  <answer104843> If you have back up your iPhone data, you can restore from the backup.  To restore information from a backup, use one of the following methods after connecting your iOS device to the computer with which you normally sync:  Right-click (or Control-click) the device and choose Restore from Backup If you have a new phone, you can connect to iTunes and it will prompt to restore from your backup Solution from Apple.com: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766  <answer104865> [I realize this is an older question and may not solve the problem for the OP, but this answer is intended to provide guidance to others.]  If you use iTunes backups, there is emonly one backup (the latest) maintained per device at any point in time/em. So in this case the new backup overwrote the older backup, and it would be possible to recover only if a copy of code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup//code was made before the clean install (through Time Machine or any other solution), restoring that folder on the system and doing a restore from iTunes.  You can see the device backups (with the timestamps) available in iTunes by going to strongiTunes/strong â†’ strongPreferences/strong and then navigating to the strongDevices/strong tab.  Some recommendations and points to note to avoid such a situation and have something to fall back to:  ul liYou can have multiple backups in iCloud for a device and choose which backup to restore from (assuming there are no device/iOS compatibility issues)./li liUse both iCloud and iTunes backups together (once iCloud backup is turned on, automatic backups in iTunes would be turned off; so a manual backup would have to be triggered in iTunes)./li liWhen using iTunes backup, trigger a manual backup in iTunes followed by a manual backup in Time Machine before major changes to a device, like re-installing iOS or jailbreaking or recovering from older backups./li /ul  See: Choosing an iOS backup method (Should I use iTunes or iCloud to back up my iOS device?)  <answer107718> Assuming you have older backups:  Mac OS: code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/code  Windows XP: code%AppData%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup/code  Windows Vista: code%AppData%\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup/code  Windows 7: code%AppData%\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup/code  Go onto iTunes, right click on your device on the left-hand side bar, and their should be an option 'Restore From Backup', or something similar, click that and it'll restore your iPhone to a previous backup.  <comment111442> The OP says he can't <comment111501> The OP ? What's that ? <comment111511> Original Poster a term in usenet and other fora for the first one to start a thread <comment123349> The OP says the backup is bad - how do you get an OLD backup <comment123442> Why was the older backup "corrupt"? <comment123447> That was a misunderstanding of the problem. I've fixed it in the answer. Thanks.
