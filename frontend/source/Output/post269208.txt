Shared call history <body> My husband and I share a cloud under my Apple ID as we prefer to share calendars and contacts thru the cloud. However, with our current setup, we see each other's phone history, which causes confusion and sometimes results in returning each other's missed calls. Is there a simple way to separate our phone history without changing our setup?  <comment338185> You'll *have* to change your setup, since your setup is what's causing the problem. Apple IDs are meant to be singular rather than shared, so that specific data between them can be elected to be shared instead.
