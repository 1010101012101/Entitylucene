Insert key in mac book pro 2011 with windows 10 with bootcamp <body> I have a MacBook Pro 2011 running windows 10 with bootcamp.   How to use "Insert key" (Ins) or equivalent on Mac keyboard, in MS word 2016 ?  There isnt key insert, and fn + return doesn not work, and also bringing the windows onboard keybord does not send inset command ?
