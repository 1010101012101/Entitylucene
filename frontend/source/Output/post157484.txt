Finder: unlock files grid in folders <body> Using Finder:  In some folders, I can move the files around. Place them where I want in that folder. This is very good for the eyes, when the folder holds many files and only a handfuld om them are important/relevant  In other folders I simply cannot. The files are somehow fixed to a grid and can't be moved  Changing the "sort by" to NOTHING does not help, still fixed  strongHow do I force Finder to let me place the files as I choose?/strong  emMacbook Pro 2012 with Yosemite 10.10.1/em  <answer157490> In one of the folders where the items are "stuck", go to View menu  Show View Options, or press kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdJ/kbd.  In the new window, change "Arrange By" to "None" and "Sort By" to "None".  <comment185181> Ah. Didn't know there were 2 (arrange and sort). Working fine now, thanks ;)
