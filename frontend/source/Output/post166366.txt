will autocorrect reset when turned off? <body> If I turn autocorrect off for a short amount of time, will it forget the corrections it knows? on an iPod touch 5th generation, it will often mess with audio, and I would like to turn it on and off, but I am worried it will get rid of certain phrases that it autocorrects because of me using them so much.   <answer166395> The dictionary will NOT reset from turning off auto correct. (i.e. codeSettings/code  codeGeneral/code  codeKeyboards/code  codeAuto Correct/code)  To reset the dictionary visit codeSettings/code  codeGeneral/code  codeReset/code  codeReset Keyboard Dictionary/code
