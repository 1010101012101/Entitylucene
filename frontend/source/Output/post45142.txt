How many External Hard Drives can I plug to Airport Extreme? <body> I need to backup all my computer data. I'm thinking of buying 3 External Hard Drives and connect them to Airport Extreme. Can I do this?   <answer45144> Yes you can - Apple's web site says "multiple printers, multiple hard drives" and mentions using them with a USB hub.  Don't expect fancy NAS or RAID features though, you will just be able to share the existing partitions.  <answer45145> strongThe constraint is be the number of ports available on your USB hub./strong  Any connected hard drives should appear in Mac OS X.  Use a strongself-powered usb hub/strong and connect hard drives your hub. Only then will multiple external drives have enough power to run.  Also see store.apple.com for related questions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CHgpY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer45146> As shown on the Apple website, the Airport Extreme has only one USB port:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VPavM.png" alt=""  However, you can use a USB hub to connect multiple devices to it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PMPfB.jpg" alt=""  (I also wouldn't be surprised if Apple eventually creates a Thunderbolt-compatible version of the Airport Extreme — and Thunderbolt devices can be daisy-chained, so you might be able to connect more than one hard drive at a time.)  For a single hard drive, you might also like the Time Capsule which has an integrated hard drive.  For a more flexible and heavy-duty solution for multiple drives, you could use something like Drobo.  <comment51359> It’s possible to use a USB hub to connect more than one device via USB. <comment51402> Once you connect the drives, how will you back up onto them? And, how will you keep the backups updated? Will  you back up applications, prefs, system extensions? How will you deal with updating photo libraries and/or your documents folder? This is tough to do by simply dragging stuff from one place to another. You might be better off with a firewire drive directly connected to your computer and a tool like SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner. This method, over time, will update the clone to reflect your internal hard disk on your computer.
