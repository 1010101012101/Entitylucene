What is "Apple disk image Media"? <body> I have a mid-2010 MacBook Pro that I am wiping for a family member so that they can sell it. It was connected to care patient data at one point so I want to make sure it's good and clean before we sell it. So I booted under Disk Utility and wiped the "Internal Drive" by going to erase and setting the security options.   But there is a drive under "Disk Images" called "Apple disk image Media" with "OS X Base System" under it, using 1.27 GB with 728 MB free. Just wondering what this is, and if it would have info on it? I don't see any way to erase it and it isn't mentioned in any of the guides I've read.  The Mac did have Boot Camp on it, which I deleted through the OS. Not sure if it's related.
