"That event does not belong to that event store" when trying to create a new calendar event <body> I'm trying to save a new event on iPhone calendar, but it just keeps giving me this error:     strongCannot Save Event — That event does not belong to that event store/strong   What can I do to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2G1sh.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm using Google Calendar by default, but I get the same error even if I try to use another calendar, so I presume the fault is not in Google's servers. Never encountered this problem before – just started seeing it today. (Using iPhone 4 and iOS 5.0.1.)  <answer34442> Try these:  ul liClose the Calendar app completely, then retry (strongthis worked for me/strong) /li liReboot iPhone/li liTry editing the default calendar setting (Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars - Calendars)/li /ul  If none of those helps, you could read through this apple.com thread for more tips.  <answer36900> If your phone is jailbroken (and your calendar is backed up) this can be fixed fairly easily.  ol liTurn off all calendars/li liDelete the contents of "/var/mobile/Library/Calendar" (you can use something like i-FunBox or iPhoneBrowser - both free). /li liReboot the phone/li liTurn the calendars back on again/li /ol  Fixed the issue for me right away.  <answer108749> In my case the problem was that the cursor (or maybe "highlighter" is better - hard to see!) was still on another event that I had just modified.  I tried to use the "+" to add a second event to that day's calendar.  When I input a second event with different times, then pressed "Done" I got the message "That event does not belong to that event store."  I think the meaning of the error message is now clear - the second event couldn't be superimposed on the first.  So in my case simply touching a different time slot on the calendar, then entering the new appointment, solved the problem.  <answer138628> ol limake sure to disconnect your phone from computer/li lidelete calcube/li liclose all apps/li lireboot iphone/li lireinstall calcube but do not select "calendar" yet.  just select "US Holiday" for now./li ligo through the setup/li liopen calcube, go to "Settings", select "calendar" now/li litry adding in event in calendar in calcube/li liyou may need to reboot again/li /ol  I did these about 100 times, then it finally work. hahaha.....  <answer294484> I went to settings, icloud, then unchecked calendars. It asked me if I wanted to delete or keep events from the cloud on my phone. I chose DELETE. I waited one minute. I rechecked the calendar to use the cloud. I looked and all the ghost "new event" items that couldn't previously be deleted or altered were finally gone! Thank God!  <comment42047> I'd say anyone should [try these steps first](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/34442/150) (whether the phone is jailbroken or not), because it's quick &  *certainly* won't break anything. <comment77628> I followed all these instructions and my issue was resolved.
