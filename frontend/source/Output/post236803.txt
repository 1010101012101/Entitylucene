How to SCP Linux Box to Mac Drive? <body> On mac terminal SSH'ing to a linux box, my local path seems to be interpreted as a server path:  codescp objects.yml ~/Documents/code  I'm getting:  codecp: cannot create regular file /ngs/app/project/Documents': No such file or directory/code  What am i doing wrong? I'm already connected to the remote box via SSH-- is that the problem? Does this need to be executed when emnot/em already connected to the remote box?  Thanks  <comment289883> Err, `scp objects.yml ~/Documents` just copies files locally, as there is no host name specified. And yes, you don't need to log in with `ssh` to use `scp`. <comment289885> ok, thx. Is there a way to download after logging into ssh? i ask because it appears i don't have access to that remote dir without first executing a script on the remote server (company security measure). <comment289886> Does http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2857/ssh-easily-copy-file-to-local-system help? <comment290131> Try SCPing in reverse from the server's console. <comment292202> @patrix, that's awesome! i think that's the solution. <comment292203> @cortices, doesn't that require that the local machine be a server? <comment292547> @johnywhy if by 'server' you mean it needs the SSH port forwarded on its public IP, then yes. Not an ideal solution I'll admit. Patrix' answer is what you're looking for.
