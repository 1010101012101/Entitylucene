CPU usage is too high with Yosemite and an external monitor <body> I use Yosemite 10.10.4 on my MacBook Pro (2012).  I used to work with an external monitor: Apple Thunderbolt 27" monitor.  The issue is that, according to Activity Monitor, the codekernel_task/code process consumes emmore than 600%/em of CPU even when no tasks are running! The computer becomes totally unusable.   The workaround is to disconnect the external monitor, but I really need this secondary screen to work.  Why didn't Apple fix this issue in the latest Yosemite update?  Is there a fix for this?   <answer193949> This is a design feature documented by Apple. See if cooling your Mac and the processor can then speed up again and do the work you want. See this post on ideas for cooling while in clamshell mode.  ul liAny reason not to run my Macbook Pro upside-down in clamshell mode?/li /ul  You can now buy stands designed to cool your Mac.  ul lihttp://www.svalt.com/li /ul  If that doesn't work, try resetting the System Management Controller one time to ensure it's not a measurement error.  If you only need occasional cooling or to convince yourself, go ahead and open the clamshell and make sure there is good ventilation and you are not blocking the air inlet or outlet by the display hinges. The thermal management software reacts quite rapidly to changes in internal temperature.  could even use Magnets to force the display to sleep while it's actually open and allowing the entire keyboard surface to be exposed and cooling the Mac that thinks it's still working in closed clamshell mode.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203184/li /ul     Activity Monitor may show that a process named kernel_task is using a large percentage of your CPU, and during this time you may notice a lot of fan activity. This process helps manage temperature by making the CPU less available to processes that are using the CPU intensely. In other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become too hot. When the temperature decreases, kernel_task automatically reduces its activity.    So, also quit the other tasks and apps you don't need if you can't make the physical arrangement of the Mac more cool or more conducive to radiating the heat away if convection isn't working for you. The GPU will cause lots of heat if it's pushing many pixels. Decreasing resolution might help in an edge case, but you'll want to attack cooling in general as a first step.  You could also get some advanced tools to peek into the CPU rate to confirm it's reacting to heat:  ul likernel_task hundreds of % CPU yet cpu frequency is being lowered/li /ul  <answer194569> I'm having a similar issue with a 2011 13" MBP8,1 (2.7Ghz i7 CPU and HD3000 graphics), and to me it's pretty certain that it's provoked by video-intensive operations. Curiously, Hardware Monitor showed temperatures in the 70C range, quite far from the 90+C temperatures I've already seen while running big compile jobs.  I removed the bottom plate and removed far more very fine dust from the fan and its vents than I'd have expected, and blowing over the logic board dislodged even more. On the 13" model, the fan can be removed with just 3 screws after removing the bottom plate, so it's easy enough to clean (careful with the connector!). I haven't used the system much since, but 1st impressions were that the fan was much more effective again, and that the issue was gone.  Next steps will be running without the bottom plate and reducing my external screen's resolution from 1920*1080 to 1680*1080 (res. of my previous panel with which I never had problems, and a resolution that's clearly easier on the GPU for video playback).  I never understood why anyone would want to connect an external screen and NOT use the "internal" at the same time (saving battery? I just turn off the backlight in that case ...)  <answer235066> Have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) and was having 300-600+% cpu usage from codekernel_task/code. After reading some speculation online about it being a safeguard to prevent overheating, I started to wonder why my machine couldn't handle outputting to three monitors. Following the instructions here, I looked and saw none of the applications I was running were using the high-end card. After going into codeSystem Preferences &gt; Energy Saver/code and disabling codeAutomatic graphics switching/code (forcing the high-end card to always be used), the issue seems to be resolved.  <answer247176> My question was marked as a duplicate of this one but has a solution to this issue verified by many users.  rMBP kernel_task spikes when connecting more than one external monitor  :)  <answer282022> I have a MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB  With an external Sceptre X325BV monitor connected via HDMI. I was also seeing CPU percentages close to 500%.  I did three things that seem to have fixed this:  ol liI changed the laptop's retina monitor to be the main one./li liIn System Preferences  Energy Saver, I unchecked "Automatic graphics switching."/li liIn System Preferences  Mission Control, I unchecked "Displays have separate Spaces."/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rqVy.jpg" alt="Energy Saver Prefs Change" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HpLTU.jpg" alt="Mission Control Prefs chnage"  <comment231267> 37 degrees celsius (in Paris) doesn't help...I agree. But why haven't I had this issue when using Mountain Lion? <comment231268> @Mik378 Yes - and glass trapping a thin layer of air is an extremely effective insulator. Just barely wedging open the screen with a shim so that the internal display is still off (sleep proximity sensor detects the magnet in the display) - or better - using a magnet externally and opening the Mac totally are good for very warm environments. Also, WOW 37Â° in Paris!! <comment231270> But I still need the macbook's monitor. Yes, very very hot week ;) <comment231271> @Mik378 You may have to choose if the temperature can't be lowered. I've used [Duet Display](http://www.duetdisplay.com/) to let my Mac run cooler and still have two screens. You'd need an iPad and some $$ to try that though. Maybe now that you know it's cooling you can get by with reducing the GPU heat generation load (decrease resolution) to get more CPU capacity. Also, if you let it sleep for 20 minutes and still see immediate high kernel_task, it might have a hardware issue (bad temp sensor, etc...) <comment231272> Wow nice :) I wasn't aware of this Duet Display application. I own an iPad, so I will try it out. Thanks :) <comment231841> Just drop it in a bucket of 3M FlourInert. <comment260760> I have a similar problem with my macbook pro 13" the UserEventAgent , launchd and mds_stores processes suddenly take up 52% of all cpu the instant I plug in my second display. It's not temperature.. nothing gets that much hotter in 0.5 seconds. Literally, have 'top' running in a screen and plug in the thunderbolt/external video adapter and as soon as the screens have come back from their refresh and the windows are visible again you will see that those three processes have leapt to the top and idle time has gone from 97% to 47%. I have heard that the 15inch models had a problem with temperatur <comment349967> This is only working solution.
