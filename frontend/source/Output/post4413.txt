C++ code navigation on OS X <body> I'm an OS X newbie. Other than setting up Emacs / Vim with ctags or cscope or both, are there alternatives to C++ code navigation of an existing code base? I used to use Source Insight on Windows and it worked for me fairly well. I know I can setup ctags or cscope but I was wondering if there is anything even better out there. The main functionality I am looking for is quickly find definition of variables and functions and places a function is being called.  <answer4427> Is Xcode not what you're looking for ? It's the Mac OS X IDE. It'sn't installed by default, but is present on your Mac OS X DVD.  <answer6761> TextMate and BBEdit have significant followings.  I'm personally a big fan of Smultron even though development has stopped.  <answer6776> In Xcode:     quickly find definition of variables   and functions   Right-click the variable name in question, and select "Jump to Definition".  Command (apple button) + double click on the variable is a shortcut for the same thing.     quickly find places a function is   being called   Right-click the function name, and select "Find in Project"  "As Text".  <answer6777> I have used Eclipse for C++ programming on OSX.   Xcode will compile things but is not that good at dealing with C++ namespaces it is more of a C and Objectve-C tool  <comment4219> have you tried stack overflow for this one? <comment4243> @calavera, I was reluctant to post it on stackoverflow, but I did post on programmers and got one answer so far. http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/22106/c-code-navigation-on-os-x <comment4249> I was going to suggest that you take a look at Xcode and the developer tools. Xcode will allow you to Jump To Definition and project wide search. I believe you have found your answer elsewhere tho. <comment4258> Xcode might be just what I need. I have to wait and see. I tested ctags / cscope with vim as well and that could be enough as well.
