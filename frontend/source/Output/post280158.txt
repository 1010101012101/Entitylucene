Apache keeps saying: You configured HTTP(80) on the standard HTTPS(443) port! <body> I have configured an SSL web site using the macOS Server app (version 5.3). When I examine the Apache log, I see this message (twice):  precode [ssl:warn] [pid 4120] AH01916: Init: (mydomain.net:443) You configured HTTP(80) on the standard HTTPS(443) port! /code/pre  I have not made any manual modifications to the Apache config file. I tried deleting the site, then stopping and restarting the web server, and finally re-adding the site from scratch, but the warning continues to show up in the log.  What is wrong and should I care?
