Unable to use dd with SD card. One partition in particular showing "Resource Busy" <body> I've been trying to backup my SD card for a RPi Model B but I'm having no luck whatsoever. Here's what my Macbook's terminal shows under "diskutil list":  precode/dev/disk2 (internal, physical): #: TYPE                    NAME   SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0: FDisk_partition_scheme         *4.0 GB    disk2 1: Windows_FAT_16        RECOVERY 121.8 MB   disk2s1 2: Linux                          33.6 MB    disk2s3 3: Windows_FAT_32        BOOT     62.9 MB    disk2s5 4: Linux                          3.7 GB     disk2s6 /code/pre  Using dd on my Macbook running macOS Sierra. dd will create an image file of 47.2 mb and stops saying "Resource Busy" despite me running "diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk2" first. After a bit of trial and error, I've found when I run dd on each partition individually it works fine until I try the RECOVERY partition. This partition will give the "Resource Busy" error immediately. I've tried making the image with Pi-Baker and Apple's Disk Utility. None of which work.  Any thoughts? I've used dd in the past to back up sd cards with no issue. Any way I can see why it would think the resource is busy?
