Can't use iTunes songs in iMovie 10? -"protected & unavailable" <body> I can't seem to use any of my purchased songs in iTunes - basically, any of my iTunes music - in an iMovie project.   I go to the music/iTunes tab in a project and I just get a notice that x-number of songs are protected and unavailable. Does this mean that now I literally can't use any music I bought in iMovie? I was working on just a personal video and have been able to use all the songs in my iTunes library in past versions of iMovie.  I can't find an answer about it anywhere.   <comment355048> as a temp solution import into garageband export and then import into iMovie.  This should work. <comment355066> See https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/149147/checking-itunes-collection-for-drm/149170#149170
