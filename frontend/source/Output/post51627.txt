Password protect MacBook while keeping iTunes running <body> So I want to prevent anyone from messing with iTunes, or anything on my MacBook actually. How can I password protect it without losing the sound?  <answer51629> You'll need to do two things:  ol liConfigure your system to require password after sleep or screen saver/li liSet a hot corner for the screensaver (to trigger the screensaver when you want to leave your MacBook) or choose the Login Window from the menu (if you have faster user switching enabled)/li /ol     Steps to configure require password (see this Apple KB):      ol   liChoose codeApple menu/code  codeSystem Preferences/code, click codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code, and then click codeGeneral/code./li   liSelect codeRequire password... after sleep or screen saver begins./code You can adjust the amount of delay before a password is required in   the pop-up menu./li   /ol      To lock your screen quickly with fast user switching enabled, choose   Login Window from the menu with your user name. Your applications will   remain open and undisturbed, but your computer islocked.      Locking the screen doesn’t prevent other users from turning off the   computer and restarting it, and then logging in to their own accounts.   If you think this could happen, be sure to save your work before you   leave your computer.   You can set the hot corner (if desired) in the Screen Saver preferences section (see this Apple KB):     Use the strongScreen Saver/strong pane of strongDesktop &amp; Screen Saver   preferences/strong to make images appear on your screen when you aren’t   using your computer. You may want to do this to hide the items on your   desktop while you’re away.      strongHot Corners/strong: Click to set a shortcut for starting or deactivating your screen saver. From Active Screen Corners, choose Start Screen   Saver or Disable Screen Saver from the pop-up menu for a corner you   want to use, and then click OK.   <answer51630> strongTo keep any application active but to lock the machine you can try the following steps./strong  ol liLaunch the “Keychain Access” application located in /Applications/Utilities./li liChoose “Show Status in Menu Bar” from the View menu./li liNow you have a lock in the menu bar. Use this menu to:/li liClick on the "lock icon" in your menu bar/li liSelect "Lock Screen"/li /ol  This activates Screen Effects which requires your password to unlock screen, but strongdoes not stop what is currently active on the OS/strong  hr     Another way to keep any application active but to lock the machine you   can try the following steps.   ol listrongOpen System Preferences/strong  a. Select the Preference Pane "Security"  b. Choose the "General" tab  c. Check "Require password"  d. On 10.6 &amp; 10.7 you can also set the time in which you would like to wait prior to initiating the lock (in this case you may want to choose "strongimmediately/strong")/li listrongSelect "Show All" Preference Panes/strong/li listrongSelect the Preference Pane "Desktop &amp; Screen Saver"/strong  a. Set the "Start screen saver" at its minimum (3 min)/li /ol  After 3 min of no use your machine will start the screen saver and when the screen saver is stopped you will be prompted to type your Username and Password.      strongHOWEVER:/strong (Though I like strongJW8/strong slick use of strongHot Corners/strong you do not need to set them up nor do you need to wait 3 minutes for the   Screen Saver to begin, strongyou can simply use the following   key-combo/strong   precodeCrtl-Shift-Eject /code/pre  hr     You could also try the following strongcommands/strong if you have ambitions to   create a short script.      strongNOTE:/strong If a script sounds like something you would like to create you will need to ensure root privileges.   For 10.6 &amp; 10.7 use the following command to make the strongsecurity immediately follow the Screen Saver's launch/strong:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay 0 /code/pre  For 10.5, 10.6, &amp; 10.7 use the following command to strongturn on Security Preferences for your Screen Saver/strong:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set require password to wake of security preferences to true' /code/pre  strongTo force the screen to lock/strong   precodeopen "/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app" /code/pre     strongNOTE:/strong You may notice that regardless of how the screen is locked you may be immediately be prompted for your Username &amp; Password as   the running app is attempting to stop the Screen Saver/Lock.   However, your application (iTunes in this case) will continue to run   even while your screen is locked. :–)   <comment59003> Originally I was going to provide the same answer, but I couldn't get it to work :–( As it turns out when I actually tested this with iTunes rather than the YouTube video I was watching it does work for iTunes :–) <comment59009> Though I like your slick use of Hot Corners you do not need to set them up nor do you need to wait 3 minutes for the Screen Saver to take begin, you can simply use the following key-combo Crtl-Shift-Eject :–) <comment59029> @E1Suave, good point! Just wanted to point to some settings that not all users take advantage of. Key combos are quite useful too. :) <comment59030> Adding the Screen Saver to Hot Corners is very handy and you did a very good job explaining how to set them up and apply them. :–)
