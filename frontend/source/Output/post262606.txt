FileVault2 and VMWare Fusion <body> I have a mid-2014 ssd mac pro, that supports AES intruction (confirmed with codemachdep.cpu.features/code), and I'm thinking about enabling FileVault2.  Has anyone tested its performance impact? Does the CPU go up easily?  I have plenty of virtual machines, Linux, Windows and a Windows domain environment. I usually opens 3 VMs together, I'm wondering if it would be a pain to enable FDE.  Or, is there anyway to test the impact before enabling FileVault2?
