Run rake using Automator <body> I have install ruby using RVM. Next I create workflow in Automator, which detects new files in folder and then copies them to another dir. The next thing I want - to switch to those folder and run few rake scripts. I have tried to add next step to workflow:  precodecd ~/blog/octopress/ rake generate rake deploy /code/pre  But it's failed with error:     Run shell script failed - 1 error. Rake aborted   What I'm doing wrong?  <comment189135> It is possible that the shell environment is not right so the rake command fails. Redirect the rake command output so you can take a look afterwards. Just add this, `rakecmd.log 2&1` to your rake commands and view the file rakecmd.log to see where/why it failed.
