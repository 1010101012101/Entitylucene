MacBook Pro (mid-2012) Microphone Input <body> Here, it says how to use the audio jack as in input. On my MacBook Pro 13" (mid 2012), It doesn't seem to have the option in settings. Is it not possible with these computers?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U3FjL.png" alt="sound input preferences"   <answer90361> Yes, it seems the option is missing from your settings: this is what that preference panel looks like on my machine (13-inch, Mid 2009) (with nothing plugged into the audio port):  Sound Input pref pane http://f.cl.ly/items/2x0V0W0h2J1C0T1d2C2Q/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-03%20at%2000.41.28.png  Unfortunately it looks like audio input isn't implemented on your model :(  The tech specs for MacBook Pro (13-inch and 15-inch, Mid 2012) have the following for the 13-inch:     ul   liHeadphone port      ul   liSupport for Apple iPhone headset with remote and microphone/li   liSupport for audio line out (digital/analog)/li   /ul/li   /ul   ... it doesn't mention audio line in (which it does for the 15-inch).  Sorry for the bad news.  One workaround is to buy an audio input device which plugs into USB.  <answer90545> Actually it is possible to use external microphone on MacBook pro and Air 2012 Models.  It looks like Apple has redesigned it to be a multifunction plug, without telling us in plain English. What they do say is you can use the Apple iPhone headset with microphone! Now that is a Hint !  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GDZko.png" alt="enter image description here"  Since there are multiple options to connect a microphone lets take a look.  1 - For stand alone microphone with cable you could use a USB connector type or Audio to USB converter.  2- You could use a BlueTooth type microphone/Headset.  3 - And last not least, you could actually use your Headphone (as marked) the 1/8 inch plug, strongbut NOT with standard audio plug./strong  Here is the how: The plug is like the headphone port on iOS devices, this jack supports audio input as well as output—with as described in Apple specification.  Looking under the hood of Apple "About this Mac" you get the answer (it says it does support it).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0OxER.png" alt="enter image description here"  The microphone or headset in question must be of the three-ring variety, just like Apple’s headsets. The fourth pin (ring) is for the microphone !  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cTO2F.png" alt="enter image description here"  OK, what now? Lets assume you insist on using your microphone!!!  Get the 3.5mm 4 Position to 2x 3 Position 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - M/F  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pC9Yb.png" alt="enter image description here"  ... this headset splitter adapter breaks the audio port out into two distinct ports - one that can be used for a microphone input connection, and the other for connecting external (output) speakers.  I found stores in Europe (for about €10), but sure you can find it where you are.  <answer90555> Try removing the soundflower driver.   <answer97615> I post my solution hoping it can help someone.  I've have a MBP mid-12 13in, with the so-problematic unique audio jack. I'me sure that external&amp;internal usage is possible because of the iphone headset test.  So I bought the TRRS cable, and my first tests fails: I got an external audio detected, but no luck with the internal line.  Then, I found an amazon comment about the cable, solved:  ul listrongFirst, connect your external and internal lines to the Y cable/strong/li liSecond, connect the Y cable to the MB/li liIt should take a couple of seconds to be recognised as an external mic/li /ul  When I trying it fails again. strongBut/strong I've found the trick:  ul listrongThe internal line must be a microphone/strong/li liSo after being detected by the MB as an external mic, you can unplug the mic and connect anything else (an iphone)/li liemNote: I've can only testing with a cheap non-powered computer mic/em/li /ul  <answer127091> The Griffin iMic is probably the most commonly touted solution for this "new" problem. This way you can monitor through the headphone jack, and the USB headphone jack also....I would assume. Maybe it's one or the other, however.   Either way the digital solution may improve signal quality also. There are other cheaper versions of the iMic but it seems Griffin was like "Hey Apple, want to make a computer that's missing stuff so we can make some more money?"  http://store.griffintechnology.com/catalog/product/view/id/623/?gclid=CLKDicGj1b0CFQaTfgodJqUAVA  If the link breaks just look up griffin iMic. It appears B&amp;H currently sells it for $23.78  I've also seen similar products via https://www.google.com/#q=usb+to+3.5mm  I hope this helps with the "no line-in" problem on the 13" MacBooks and the new 27" iMacs. As well as the "My line-in doesn't recognize my mic" problem.   Alternatively try that 3.5mm 4 Position to 2x 3 Position 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - M/F that Buscar mentioned above.   <answer174670> You can use a Playstation 2 singstar microphone USB converter (3€) on any macbook pro   <answer204912> You can connect an external mic only if it has 4 pins on the 3.5mm jack. The MBP Mid 2012 takes some time to recognise the mic so just wait a little bit. You should see 'external mic' appear in strongSystem PreferencesSoundInput/strong If your jack does not have 4 pins, i think that you can use a 3.5mm female to 3.5mm male 4 pins converter... But the 4 pins are very important to make it work. Hope it helps  <answer244487> Found this, which allowed me to use a mic that wouldn't work any other way. Masterful. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI0vezevfXM  <answer249015> Download LineIn, it is a free open source app and it solves this problem.  It worked beautifully for an old keyboard that I own.  <comment106043> it is plugged in !! <comment106046> It is not, since our system does not recognize it and thus does not display the option for it. Do you have another mic, one with power source build in. <comment106215> Perhaps @Buscar웃 was trying to ask you to describe what you have plugged into your Audio in port. Is it a male to male metal [stereo TRS jack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector) or perhaps a mono jack or even a TOSlink optical jack? We can presume you have more details about your setup, but as written, we can only guess what your real problem is. <comment106261> I had a mono Mic plugged in <comment106286> soundflower is a third party audio driver, it may be disabling the audio port's ability to receive input. <comment106288> soundflower is not made by Apple. <comment106290> so why would apple put a non apple approved software on they product that inhibits users from using external microphone? <comment106292> Apple did not, sunflower is a driver for a USB audio device. This would have been installed after the initial OS install. <comment106293> It does mention the Apple iPhone with microphone !! so it is possible <comment106297> I re-read Ashley's response and I don't see what you are referencing. Ashley's screen shot is showing the expected results of looking at the Sound preference pane with the drop down menu for switching between using the port for input/output and there is no sound flower driver. <comment106326> @Buscar웃 Oh yes! Thanks for explaining in your answer... I have played with the same feature on iPad using an iRig, but hadn't quite connected the dots to realise that was possible on a Mac too. <comment106341> you are welcome. <comment106347> Now that's what I call hitting it out of the ball park! Not only will this help the asker determine what might be going wrong, but others can surely learn how the hardware is designed. <comment116788> Splendid answer! Thanks @Buscar <comment172492> It's also _important_ to note that the mic must be ___switched on before you plug it in___ or the detection hardware won't recognise it. <comment301317> Welcome to Ask Different.

I doubt hardware wiring supports any sort of analog stereo input in these latops. (Sadly, My MBP Retina does not detect microphone nor guitar with such splitter cable tough.) <comment367840> Worth noting that unpowered mics (like my call recorder mic) don't seem to work at all this way.
