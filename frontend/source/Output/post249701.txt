Simple video management and processing tool for Mac? <body> I'm looking for a non-professional tool (open-source or commercial) to manage video collection and perform simple processing:  ul liimport videos and photos (from an SD-card) and parse date from file names/li librowse videos and photos by date and manually assigned names or tags/li limake video from photos ("slide show" produced by my camera)/li lirotate, cut, and trim videos/li liprobably perform other simple manipulations like changing brightness/li /ul  Single tool is preferred.  hr  What I've tried so far:  ul libash + ffmpeg  This works of course but is a bit of pain./li liiPhoto + iMovie + QuickTime player  ul liiPhoto is ok, except that I need separate tool for video processing./li liiMovie is almost ok for video processing, but it sometimes hangs when rotating video, so I'm using QuickTime player for rotating. Also, I was unable to set high fps when making video from photos, but maybe I'm missing something./li liQuickTime player is also almost ok for video processing, but free version doesn't support making video from photos, and I didn't try Pro version yet./li /ul/li /ul  So iPhoto + QuickTime player emPro/em is likely to be a solution, but I'd like to look at the alternatives before buying anything.  <answer249708> One option is DaVinci Resolve, it is free, but requires 16 GB of RAM and the largest GPU available for the machine.   Requirements:  hr  if you're looking for something on the simpler side, and free I may add, GoPro Studio is also available for free, but with some limitations, such as with filters and effects that must be rendered in another software before being imported into the software itself.
