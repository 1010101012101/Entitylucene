View another user's files in OS X <body> Is there a way to (temporarily) view another user's file on OS X other than to change the permissions of the file? I'd like the OS to ask for the user name/password.  I guess what I'm looking for is something like Window's idea of running Windows Explorer as another user (ideally at file/directory level only). The ssh idea fails because the Finder cannot recognize the permission granted.   An absolute requirement is not to move the user's files.  <answer52517> strongEDITED/strong to match edited requirements.  You can achieve exactly what you want by creating a emShared/em folder. To do so go to strongSystem Preferences  Sharing  File Sharing/strong and Add all the folders you want to share.  You can do this, too, by directly selecting a folder in the Finder,, choosing strongGet Info/strong from the strongFile/strong menu, and enable emShared Folder/em to share it (or deselect "Shared Folder" to stop sharing the folder).  Extracted from Apple's 101: File Sharing.  hr  You can achieve this in a couple of ways.  strongLogging as root/strong will grant you read and write privileges to all areas of the file system. You'll need to have the root user enabled. To do so, assuming you're using Lion:  ol liGo to strongSystem Prefereces  Accounts/strong./li liClick the lock and authenticate with an administrator account./li liClick emLogin Options/em./li liClick the emEdit/em or emJoin/em button at the bottom right./li liemOpen Directory Utility/em./li liAuthenticate with an administration account./li liChoose strongEnable Root User/strong from the strongEdit/strong menu./li liEnter the root password./li /ol  Here is described for earlier OS.  strongPlacing the file under the emShared Folder/em/strong (/Users/Shared), or emSharing/em the folder, the one where the file you want to edit is, will grant other users access to that file.

Open up a terminal and do codeman su/code and codeman sudo/code for more information.  <answer153759> h1To view the file in Finder (GUI)/h1  substrongNOTE:/strong  You're not viewing as the other user - but you're still viewing.

The first method does not let Finder open the file/directory. Sure it works on the command line but you cannot edit excel files there. The second method is destructive in the sense that the user has to move his files to a particular place. <comment60088> Enabling the root user is not necessary and usually a bad idea. You can achieve the same end more safely using su and sudo. At your shell prompt su -  this will prompt for the admin password and you will become the admin user. From here you can use sudo on any command to achieve root access for that command only e.g sudo ls /Users/otheruser. If you need to interact with applications and files from the other user account then use open filename or open -A  from the shell to launch from admin account <comment60089> I ment logging as root, not through terminal but with the logging screen.

And for the sharing folder, i'll edit my answer, as I was not clear enough. <comment60099> Why couldn't you just log in as the user that owns the files? <comment60110> @CoffeeRain I need access to the two accounts simultaneously. <comment60119> @Kevin Tried with iTunes, failed with : LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/iTunes.app with error -10810.
