Free VPN client app works under wifi hotspot <body> Since last year, PPTP VPN doesn't work. I have a VPN with PPTP for the workplace and I used to connect through FlowVPN by changing the address and the credentials.  However, the last 2 days, it has stopped worked too if you are connected with a Wifi Hotspot.  My Mac doesn't have an ethernet and I create a Wifi hotspot with a Windows laptop which is connected with ethernet.  If I login directly to Wifi, FlowVPN works without any issue.  So, do you know any free alternative?
