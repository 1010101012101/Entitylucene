Cisco IPSec forgets password (Mavericks) <body> Cisco IPSec seems to have no way to store the password of the connection permanently. I have found on the web some solutions for the Mountain Lion release, but none for OS-X Mavericks.  Is it impossible, or has someone found an answer and didn't post it?  <answer218928> Per this question, it's not so much a problem with the OS as a problem with the configuration of the VPN on the emserver/em side.  One of the options your IT admins can do is force passwords to not be remembered for the VPN connection, and the OS X client will honor this setting. If you have the keychain open and are looking at the saved password when you connect, you can actually see the saved password strongdisappear/strong when you connect to the server.  I've searched for a way around this going so far as trying to applescript the login window, but they've blocked that avenue is well.
