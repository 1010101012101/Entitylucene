Windows live hotmail on iPhone <body> Setting up mail on my iPhone, I didn't see an option for MS Live Mail/Hotmail.  I understand (due my mastery of search engines) that there are a few options. What's the best?   <answer1771> The priority for accessing any email service would be:  ol listrongExchange/strong: Push email, folders, syncs read/unread status, contact sync, calendar sync/li listrongIMAP/strong: Folders, syncs read/unread status/li listrongPOP3/strong: Bare bones email reading, usually only useful for a single client unless you "keep a copy on the server"/li /ol  It seems that some people have had success using Exchange; IMAP seems to require either a premium account or 3rd party software; and POP3 is possible for free accounts.  Keep an eye on Apple's page as they will probably update it as new solutions are added by Microsoft.  <answer1772> From what I understand, Microsoft doesn't allow Hotmail IMAP access. The workaround is IzyMail. I haven't tried it, but it seems like it works as an intermediary between the iPhone and Hotmail servers in order to get a "simulated" IMAP experience lol.  Senseful's post has a good information. I use Exchange for my work email, calendars and contacts, and I love it. Gmail works really well with IMAP, and I really do not like POP3 from past experiences.  <answer52403> Came back to add an update:  In iOS 5 or later, you can add Microsoft Hotmail natively on the "add account" setup screen.  (In May, 2012, I started getting errors in my iPhone Exchange account setup, so I had to delete the account and re-connect via the iOS Hotmail account setup).  See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1694 for setup instructions.  <comment10845> You should also note that izymail doesn't appear to be a free service. <comment13084> Microsoft has now "Exchange-enabled" all hotmail accounts. http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/08/windows-live-hotmail-gets-exchange-activesync.ars
