Partition problem after HDD to SSD swap <body> Recently decided to replace my nearly full 500GB HDD with a 1TB SSD to breathe some new life into my mid-2010 Macbook Pro. I used a toaster-style drive cloner (Dyconn Dubbler) to do a sector by sector duplication of the drive. Everything went smoothly but when I booted up from the new drive, I seem to only have around 500 GB of total space, almost all of it full. I fooled around with the partitions a little in disk utility, hoping I could maybe create and delete one, but haven't had any luck. Thought I would be able to drag the partition size but that doesn't seem to be an option. Here is what I see in disk utility with the drive attached/mounted from my other machine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tN82P.png" alt="enter image description here"  Feel like I am missing something obvious here, any help would be greatly appreciated!  Edit: forgot to mention, running most recent version of Yosemite  <answer159966> The drive cloner did exactly what it was supposed to do â€“ clone the drive, right down to the original volume's capacity. Try reformatting the SSD with one 1TB partition and then doing a standard Time Machine restore.  <answer159967> The following codediskutil cs resizeStack/code command is vastly undocumented and as such potentially destructive.  emstrongPlease backup your Mac OS X before proceeding./strong/em  ol liFirst you have to backup your codeRecovery HD/code: Start codeTerminal.app/code and enterbr codedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1/code press enter and quit codeTerminal.app/code/li liStart Disk Utility and enable 'Show every Partition' in the Debug menu After a few seconds all partitions should be visible/li liChoose codeRecovery HD/code on the left side and mount the partition codeRecovery HD/code.

Check first if it works and then accept it. So please remove it from my answer. Actually i'm answering using an iPhone which isn't very comfortable. Back on a real Mac i'll try to improve it. <comment188049> Okay will do--received a similar suggestion elsewhere so it appears like a promising fix but I'll remove it for now. <comment188057> If you add the output of `diskutil list` and `diskutil cs list` entered in `Terminal.app` to your question i might improve/modify my answer. <comment188094> @klanomath Wow, you answered with your phone yet you managed to capture and upload the screenshots? How did you do that? <comment188095> @ksh ;-) I modified an old answer. But that's also a PITA
