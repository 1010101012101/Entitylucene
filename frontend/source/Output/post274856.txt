My husbands account is also showing my Bookmarks, how can I disable? <body> All my bookmarks are also on my husbands user page, I would like to remove them and read one question as to sign out of my Apple ID when in his account but its asking me if I want to make a copy otherwise all my data will be removed from this mac but will still be available on my other devices .... I just daren’t risk losing everything on the mac either in my user page or his ... has anyone come across this problem and how did you solve it ?   <answer274859> You shouldn't be using the same Apple ID for two different people, so ideally yes you should sign out of the Apple ID entirely and create a separate one.  If you still wish to use the same Apple ID, you can just disable Safari sync by opening System Preferences → iCloud and disabling Safari.                     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQEoT.png" width="474"  <comment345705> Well my husband doesnt have or need an Apple ID , he merely surfs the internet occasionally . Thanks for the reply , I can disable Safari sync of course  but thats going to affect my iPhone and iPad ..... ahh <comment345706> @sally No, it will only disable it for the specific user on the specific device you disable it on. Your iOS devices and other Mac accounts will not be affected.
