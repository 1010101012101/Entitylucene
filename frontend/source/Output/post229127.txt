Create a virtual machine running Safari 7.1 <body> Safari 7.1.x is not included in any standard release of OS X or iOS/iOS emulator, and as far as I know it is also not included in any standalone package that one could simply download and install on some old virtual device. But I noticed that Browserstack has a VM running Mavericks with a version of Safari 7.1.8. Would it be possible to recreate such a virtual machine locally, and how?
