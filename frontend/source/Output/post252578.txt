OS X Web Server for Jupyter/IPython <body> I have a Mac with OS X Server, and I'd like to set up its web server module properly so that I can remotely access a Jupyter Notebook server.  I know that I could do this with ssh tunneling, but I want to be able to access it from an iPad, where tunneling seems to be problematic.  I can remotely reach the vanilla web site, but if I then launch the Jupyter server (on port 8888), and try to connect, I am unable to.   Is there something that needs to be done separately to access other ports?
