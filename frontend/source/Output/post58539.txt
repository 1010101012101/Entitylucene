How do you create an alias for iPhoto package folders in mountain lion? <body> Has the ability to create aliases to folders inside the iPhoto package file been disabled or removed?  I used to sync up my LightRoom library with iPhoto by using an alias to the Originals/Masters folder inside the iPhoto library package. But it now appears as disabled in the finder file menu and completely gone in the context menu and cannot figure out a way to create aliases to these type of folders.   Am I going to have to ditch iPhoto completely or is there a workaround for this?  strongEdit:/strong Example of what I mean  <answer58545> This still is possible via a work around.  The right-click contextual menu does not contain an option emMake Alias/em for the Originals/Masters directories, but it does for subdirectories. The option emMake Alias/em always shows in the menubar under emFile &#x2192; Make Alias/em but is greyed out for the Originals/Masters directories.  h2Workaround/h2  ol liGo to a subdirectory of Originals/Master in Finder./li liCreate your alias, kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdL/kbd./li liOpen the emInfo/em of the created alias folder, kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdI/kbd./li liClick the button emSelect new Original/em/li liPress kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdG/kbd to enter a custom path./li liEnter your path, e.g. code/Users/my_name/Pictures/Aperture Library.aplibrary/Masters/code/li liRename the Alias folder./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gqTkG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LEDW9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment67380> awesome worked like a charm except its shift command g think you had a typo there <comment67381> Oh yeah, will fix that... <comment67382> and it wouldn't let me do it in a subfolder i had to go up to a parent folder not sure if this has anything to do with the fact i have this on a secondary drive or not but subfolders gave me the same disabled menu option <comment67384> @ChrisMcGrath That's strange. I can create an alias for any folder in any subdirectory of `Masters`. I don't know about `Originals` as I don't have such a folder. But Aperture and iPhoto can now share the same Library. So it should work for both.
