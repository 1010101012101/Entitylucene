"File Open" dialog is missing sidebar items <body> I'm having the strangest issue since updating to OS X El Capitan. My "Open File" dialogs show the sidebar but all my main (and useful) locations are missing. Take a look at this screenshot. This screenshot shows Keychain Access but this happens in Safari when I'm trying to attach a file to Gmail for example, or uploading an image to Facebook.  What I would like is for the sidebar to show my home directories, such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.  Help?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dJ3XT.png" alt="enter image description here"   <answer208241> Open a Finder window; you can drag folders onto the sidebar, and they’ll appear under a badly-named “Favorites” section.  Weird, but I think I like it. Keeps the plebeians out of trouble, makes it mo’ fancier for power users.  strongEDIT/strong  haha it doesn’t have any memory… stuff dropped into Favorites disappears. What is going on here… filed in Apple Radar #22916266  <answer208286> I had the same issue and fixed it in the following way:  ol liWhile in a "Open File" or "Save As" dialog box (that doesn't show Favorites), drag any folder to the sidebar. This will create a "Favorites" category in the sidebar that only shows that folder./li liReboot./li /ol  After rebooting, all of the dialog box sidebars should show Favorites as it appears in Finder, synchronized.  <answer209804> I had the same problem.  I resolved it by going into the Finder and making a change to the Favorites area (eg dragged a folder in Favorites up one position).  After closing the finder window and reopening to make sure the change stuck, I rebooted.  File/Open then worked as normal.  <answer210469> ol liGo to your user library in Finder. Hold down kbd⌥/kbd while opening the strongGo/strong menu and click strongLibrary/strong. /li liNavigate to the strongPreferences/strong folder./li liRemove any files that are or contain codecom.apple.finder.plist/code. (The removal of those files will very likely reset your strongFavourites/strong list in Finder.)/li liRestart or log out and log back in again then empty the trash and try again.   Restarting might not be necessary. As madpoet says:     You can also emrelaunch/em Finder if you don't want to reboot or log out. Right click on Finder icon while you're pressing kbd⌥/kbd and you'll see the strongRelaunch/strong option there.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBecK.png" alt="Relaunch Finder." /li /ol  hr  Alternatively, you can use this Bash oneliner by Christophe Marois:  precodecd ~/Library/Preferences &amp;&amp; sudo find com.apple.finder.plist* -exec rm {} \; &amp;&amp; killall Finder /code/pre  <answer210508> Go to strongFinder - Preferences - Sidebar/strong, and put a check next to all your emFavorites/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nmb0Fm.jpg" alt="Finder - Preferences..." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YYA2Xl.jpg" alt="Finder Preferences - Sidebar"  Installing El Capitan might have reset a few of your original settings (it reset my desktop backgrounds). It comes with the territory when installing major updates, but this should fix it.  <comment251133> Only in file-picker dialogs, or in Finder windows too? <comment251150> Only in the file-picker dialogs @Tetsujin, Finder itself shows the sidebar content as it should. <comment253267> I have this too - and it also does it in Chrome. Reboot temporarily fixes it. Seems like an El Cap bug. <comment253268> This isn't a fix - it's a temporary workaround - it goes away again (for some reason). This is a bug in El Cap. <comment253431> Is the top entry in your Favorites “iCloud Drive?” If so, you might try moving another folder to the top position and re-booting. A non-default folder, for instance.  I suspect that it’s something to do with iCloud Drive with respect to Favorites. I noticed that on one of my El Cap MacBooks, the fix stayed, but on another MacBook, it didn’t. The only difference was that iCloud Drive was the top entry in the one that kept disappearing. Now both are ok. <comment253527> My top item is 'Devices' - iCloud Drive isn't listed so your hypothesis appears wrong and I predict both your machines will fail again. <comment254131> Same problem, you can go to FinderPreferencesSidebar and check them all, they will remain there in Finder... but NOT in any programs. For example, I open Photoshop CC 2015 and if you drag the folders you want into the Favorites area, they will NOT be there when you reopen the program. Same for ALL programs across the board. This is very frustrating. <comment257408> Negative. Doesn't fix it :( <comment257566> Thanks Toby. I'll look into it! <comment259228> This is a really frustrating issue.  It's amazing how something so simple that causes so many headaches when it is not working properly. <comment260240> This finally did it!  I had to remake my favorites though, <comment260481> That is pretty hardcore... lol. I clearly see why you're at 11.7k rep ;) <comment262483> This worked for me in finder, but not in file open panels. <comment263630> You can also "relaunch" finder if you don't want to reboot or log out. Right click on finder icon while you're pressing "alt" key and you'll see the "Relaunch" there <comment264121> That did it. Bash one-liner: `cd ~/Library/Preferences && sudo find com.apple.finder.plist* -exec rm {} \; && killall Finder` <comment264575> @ChristopheMarois That managed to just remove Favourites completely from Finder with no fix for the file open/save dialog. <comment264576> The problem doesn't lie with Finder, but in the file open/close dialogs. <comment264634> @ConstantMeiring sorry about that, it did fix it for me <comment265881> Works for me. I had to restart, relaunch finder was not enough. <comment266374> Yay! This worked. It brought back all my previous favorites. I also had to restart. <comment268420> Worked for me as well (used the bash one-liner); also restored shortcuts to recent projects in Xcode. <comment269404> Fixed for me but needed to log out and not just kill Finder! @ConstantMeiring the favourites disappered befor the logout, but then they came back as they were before! <comment273937> that was great... I didn't even have to reboot, just restart Finder after moving one sidebar item one position up <comment274268> This worked for me, at least for now - will see if the problem crops up again! <comment278745> What is "Apple Radar"? <comment278842> This sucks.. same problem.  Still here in 10.11.3. <comment278961> Apple’s bug tracker  https://bugreport.apple.com <comment278965> Thanks, I thought so. I can't seem to find the bug with that ID. Can you tell my what the status is? <comment281902> There's a bigger problem somewhere.  My sidebar is missing all drives, volumes, and the computer itself.  All but the computer are selected for display in Finder preferences (and originally the computer was too).  If I reactivate the computer's visibility using the checkbox, the setting is ignored and the checkbox clears itself.  Sometimes it'll clear itself while the prefs dialog is still open.  Finder = wholly defective <comment283970> Thanks! This is the best fix, the other one involving deleting the files will make you reconfigure Finder again. <comment285435> this killed my favorites from finder too, lol )) ok, fallback to cleaning preferences <comment292385> Keep your old `com.apple.finder.plist` around safe somewhere just in case this wipes out something you care about (e.g., all your Desktop settings). After doing this, you can restore the old `plist` and the fix seems to stick. <comment293358> problem still here in 10.11.5 for me... <comment295139> The Open/Save dialogs are not a Finder function, so restarting Finder alone may not be adequate.  The Items are set via Finder though, so I suppose it makes sense that they're stored in Finder's prefs. <comment295143> This worked for me, and was a better fix than deleting prefs since I don't have to waste time trying to remember my settings.  I wonder if it has anything to do with Parallels, which is filling my sidebar with copies of the same WIndoze drive... <comment295144> Right, this wasn't about a Finder issue, but with a problem occurring *only* on open/save dialogs.  Thanks for the effort though. <comment301127> the bash one liner doesn't work for me <comment308815> I usually solve the problem restarting osx, without removing anything. I was looking for something that doesn't require this restart. <comment309996> problem still exists for me 10.11.6.  reboot fixes it for a week or two <comment311350> Thanks, this is great! Rebooted, this worked for me. Will see if it holds. <comment313524> Used one liner from @ChristopheMarois - needed a full restart. (Not rebooted for ~2 months so was probably due ;)) <comment315610> You don't need to do any of this. All you need to do is relaunch the Finder. Hit Cmd-Option-Esc, select "Finder", hit "Relaunch". That's it. <comment315611> All you have to do is relaunch the Finder. You don't need to drag anything to the sidebar first, and you don't need to reboot. <comment320653> Fixed it for me just fine, the accepted answer removed everything for me ... so IMO this is the best answer <comment320654> One liner just removed everything, didn't solve anything, had to use answer below by going to preferences. <comment321877> Same here, happens from time to time and a reboot is the fix. <comment331063> This worked for me without rebooting. I did have to restart Finder. <comment349113> @SébastienGicquel Log out and in also worked for me (while relaunch didn't). <comment370894> Seeing the same issue on Sierra 10.12.6 after getting a new Mac and restoring it from a TimeMachine backup. <comment370895> I have the same issue on Sierra 10.12.6 after getting a new Mac and restoring it from a TimeMachine backup, and this solution unfortunately does _not_ help. After the Finder restart I get weird behavior, dragging stuff into the favorites gives the wrong icons, it doesn't show up in open file dialogs, the finder settings  sidebar  favorite checkboxes can't be disabled, and after another Finder restart all favorites are gone again. Maybe a new bug in 10.12.6 or deleting that plist file is not enough anymore.
