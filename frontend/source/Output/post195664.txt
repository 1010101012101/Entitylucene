MacBook goes to sleep, won't wake up w/keyboard or mouse <body> I think people have posted this before but I wanted to be sure the fix wasn't different for my particular model.   I am running a MacBook Pro, mid-2012 build, Yosemite (10.10.4).  I just got the thing last week.   SO I migrate all my stuff over, and I am using it when BOOM it goes to sleep and the screen is black.   I couldn't wake up the computer until I closed the lid and re-opened it. BTW the kepyboard and power switch were both unresponsive while the screen was black.   When I closed the lid and re opened it it came back.   I checked the hot corners and sleep settings. I haven't tried resetting the SMC yet, though that's on the agenda, or resetting the PRAM but I wanted to be sure either of those would work.   I'm a relative tech idiot; I have done certain amounts of repair on my own macs (I can replace certain parts) but when it comes to problems like this I get sort of baffled, (I really, really don't know how to use terminal and I should, but I am always deathly afraid of messing something up). Maybe I am just software challenged and old.   Anyhow any advice would be appreciated.   EDIT: I reset the SMC but it happened again. I did notice that when I close the lid and open it, the computer only wakes up when the white light on the front (The one that slowly turns on and off during sleep) is blinking -- when the computer is unresponsive it is steady rather than that slow rhythm it usually does (It's the one that supposedly was designed to follow human breathing).   This is a really annoying problem.
