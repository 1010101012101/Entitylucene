How do I connect my IPad Air 1 to the internet via ethernet without creating an AP? <body> How do I connect my iPad Air to the internet with an ethernet cable without creating an access point or a wireless signal/hotspot of any kind?

Even if you find another adapter that uses the same chipset, Apple's drivers probably won't load unless the dongle identifies itself as an Apple product.  <comment242657> @DavidPostill Probably better to recommend that the asker request migration, rather than suggesting a repost. <comment242658> @DavidRicherby It shouldn't matter, this question is on the way to being closed as off-topic. <comment242659> @joe You can flag your question (as other) and ask for a moderator to migrate it. <comment242660> @DavidPostill Sure but I don't think closure prevents migration. (I agree that it means the question's only active on one site. That prevents duplication of answerer effort, which makes moot the most compelling reason for not reposting.) <comment242661> @DavidRicherby I pinged the OP to request migration if he wants. Also people shouldn't answer off-topic questions ... ;) <comment246556> Sure, the OP would like to migrate the question to an apple-stackexchange if the OP knew one existed, so I apologise for not researching enough, and thank you for moving it and not deleting it. The reason for why I wanted the above was why I couldnt respond or comment to anything here. (Sorry for not explaining) <comment246557> That's what I assumed the problem was, and I also assumed there was no app or anything that could install any sort of driver to interface with other dongles. I'll try the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter you linked when I get home, but, the description of that adapter says its designed for Macbook Air computers, so will it work with an iPad Air? <comment246622> @JoePearson Well, "someone on the internet says it works", and we know Apple already has a Darwin (OS X / iOS Unix/kernel layer) driver for it, so it's most plausible that they'd built that driver into iOS. Which is better evidence than we have for any other USB Ethernet dongle. <comment263254> I can confirm that (tested during the week of 11/9/2015) it works using the actual APPLE Brand USB Camera adapter and APPLE Brand USB Ethernet RJ45 adapter and a powered USB hub. I tested it on iOS 8 and 9 and it works. It does give a message that the accessory is not supported when you first connect but touch OK and about 10 seconds later the internet connection will be available. I can also confirm that as soon as I substituted the APPLE ethernet adapter with a Cables Unlimited brand it did NOT work. My goal was to not only get the internet / network connection working, but also to try to ge
