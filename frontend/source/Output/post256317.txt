2013 iMac 27' Display Issue (data cable damaged?) <body> I replaced HDD to SSD and assembled pieces again. When I boot up the iMac, I found black lines on display (looks partly not broken).  I searched Internet, and some says graphic card problem, but I didn't touch anything but cable to lift up. (took off the cables, and put them back)  Could the damaged display data cable cause this situation? I hope I could fix this by just replacing the cables..  <comment319658> Welcome to Ask Different.
