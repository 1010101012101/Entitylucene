Unable to enter safe mode. Gets stuck at progress bar (100%) while trying to log in <body> Macbook Pro Retina 13", late 2013.  Unable to enter safe mode (via holding shift key). Result as in title. Hangs after me waiting for mutliple minutes.  What troubleshooting can I do?  Need safe mode to do other troubleshootings.  Edit1: note, that the progress bar at first moves but very very slowly, compared to non-safe-mode logging-in. Maybe I should wait overnight or something? Is there a way to show any debug messages while this is running?  Also asked on Apple forum: https://discussions.apple.com/message/31699416#31699416  <answer284082> The "solution" was just to wait much much longer (longer than any other boot you have seen), patiently and not assume it was broken :).  <comment355537> What's the longest you've waited for Safe Mode to finish booting? Generally Safe Mode will take longer to boot up. With your hardware if it's still _frozen_ after 10 or so minutes after the progress bar has stopped, I'd say you've waited long enough. Also, do you have either (or both) FileVault enabled or a Firmware password set? Finally, are you using the built-in keyboard?
