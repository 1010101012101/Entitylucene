Mail.app Stop checking for new messages automatically <body> My Mail.app preferences  codeGeneral/code  codeCheck for new messages/code is set to codeEvery hour/code. However, it seems to have no effect and new mail has the nerve to come in whenever it wants to.  My one guess is my mail accounts have IDLE enabled. From Wikipedia:     IDLE is an IMAP feature [...] that allows a client to indicate to the server that it is ready to accept real-time notifications.   I can't check if that's the problem because that option seems to have been removed from Mail.app in macOS Sierra. Further more, according to this question that might not be the fix at all.  So, what can I do to keep Mail.app from automatically fetching new mail? Specifically I'd love if I could set it to fetch every hour.  <comment341652> I have the same problem in macOS Sierra. I have settings to "Never" check so that I can control things manually and not be distracted. Mail still gets my messages automatically even though "Check for new messages" is set to "manually". Any help would be appreciated.
