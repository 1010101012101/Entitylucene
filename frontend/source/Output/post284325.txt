Prevent iCloud Drive from removing specific folders <body> I'd like to use iCloud Drive to sync my documents + desktop.  However, many times it will remove projects while I'm still working on them (even small ones, like 10MB).  Is there some sort of flag that will tell macOS to sync a folder, but never remove it until I say so?  Mind that I wouldn't like to emnot sync/em a certain folder, I'd like to emkeep macOS from removing it/em to create purgeable space.  <answer284643> As of macOS Sierra 10.12.4, it is not possible to flag individual folders to stay on your local drive at all times. This is an all-or-nothing toggle.  You may access it under strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongiCloud/strong → strongiCloud Drive Options…/strong There, uncheck codeOptimize Mac Storage/code.  This will prevent your files/folders backed by iCloud from being purged automatically from the local storage.  <answer296449> You can add '.nosync' to any file/folder name to prevent syncing. The element will only be saved in your local harddrive. (Works in Sierra, High Sierra, maybe other versions...not confirmed)  <comment358901> Is using iCloud Drive a requirement or can you use something like Dropbox or Google Drive? <comment358940> I understand. Thanks. <comment359112> iCloud allows me to save disk space, while other solutions don't. Not that it works that well, unfortunately... :-/
