How do you make the dock more sensitive to being shown? <body> The amount that you have to move the mouse downwards to get the dock to trigger is too high in my opinion.  I've only found the following settings:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0 /code/pre  This set the speed of the transition to 0, but does not make it easier to trigger.  precodedefaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 0 /code/pre  This sets the delay to 0 once triggered, but does not make it easier to trigger.  I want it to launch the moment the mouse touches the edge of my screen.

I found code0.4/code suits me most.  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0 defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.4 killall Dock /code/pre  <comment225697> Possible duplicate of [How can I make auto-hide/show for the dock faster?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/33600/how-can-i-make-auto-hide-show-for-the-dock-faster). <comment225701> that looks like a Dupe from this answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/70598/46541 <comment225705> For some reason it requires me to drag my mouse/finger down even once I've reached the edge of the screen.  The extra drag drives me crazy.  It's much more noticeable with the mouse.
