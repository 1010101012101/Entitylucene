Can I add folder keyboard shortcuts? (like there are for Home, Downloads, etc) <body> Finder's Go menu shows a bunch of keyboard shortcuts for many standard folders:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ihBSOw.png" alt="screenshot"  So within Finder, but also within the Open or Save File dialogs of other applications, I can use kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdO/kbd to go to my codeDocuments/code folder, or kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbdL/kbd for my codeDownloads/code folder, et cetera.  I happily use this hundreds of times a day.  Can I add my own keyboard shortcuts here? For example, as a Developer, I often find myself going to my code~/Code/code folder by pressing kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdH/kbd for codeHome/code, then navigating to codeCode/code. But I'd rather press something like kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbdC/kbd to go there directly.  Is this possible, and if yes, how?  <answer257711> It is indeed possible. To look at how, please read this answer – it's better than I could have explained.  Specifically, you would want to try what's written under the steps:     To open a new window every time, add a Get Specified Finder Items action, drop the folder you want to open on the list, and then add a Reveal Finder Items action.   So in Automator you would add your folder as described above, and then carry out step 4, assigning whichever shortcut you wanted for it.
