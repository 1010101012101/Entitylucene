Uninstalled app shows Open in App Store <body> I deleted Facebook from my phone because it was taking up 600MB of storage for some reason. I went to reinstall the app, and it doesn't give me the option. Instead it just says "open". But I can't open the app because I don't have it. How do I fix this?  <comment323016> Have you restarted your phone? <comment323059> How did you delete it from your phone? If it says Open, it believes the app is still installed.
