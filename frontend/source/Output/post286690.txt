What is the power draw of the iPad Air? <body> I am trying to hook a dragonfly dac to my iPad Air using the lightning to USB3 camera adapter kit.  When powering the camera adapter kit using a backup battery supply that outputs 5V/1000ma, the dragonfly will not work and the iPad says that it draws too much power and will not output sound through the lightning port.  When I use the same configuration but plug the lightning power cable into an electrical outlet, everything works and the DAC captures and processes the sound.  I cannot determine how large a power supply I would need to have the iPad keep working with the dragonfly plugged into the camera adapter kit.  <answer286702> The iPad Air comes with a 11.73 W charger (2.3 A at 5.1 V), so I would go for at least that much.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/luY4F.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment361798> How are you connecting the lightning cable to the outlet? In other words, which adapter are you using? Also, which backup battery supply are you using? <comment361811> The iPad Air comes with a 10W charger (2A at 5V), so I would go for at least that much.
