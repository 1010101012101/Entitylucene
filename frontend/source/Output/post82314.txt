iPhone default Bluetooth music app <body> How does my iPhone choose which music app to start when I pair with the Bluetooth unit in my car? I'd like it to automatically start Spotify every time, but sometimes it starts playing from the Music app, even if I've used Spotify earlier that day.  <answer142522> I don't know if there would be a way to change the app that plays but maybe in your car's Bluetooth settings there may be an option for disabling auto play.  Not exactly what you're looking for but at least the same song from Music won't keep playing?  <comment94996> This is an interesting question. Would you mind trying to edit your question to document some of the steps? As in, I play Spotify at 10:00am for 30 min. Than after lunch I pair it to BT, and use the BT accessory to play the music, etc. <comment95094> I started the car at 6:30 PM after not having used Bluetooth in the car for several days. It automatically started playing the first track of the first album in Music.  I stopped it and started playing from Spotify. Thirty minutes later, I shut the car off, and Spotify stopped playing, as it should have.  I used the phone off and on for the next few hours, browsing the web, etc., but never playing music or any other audio for that matter.  When I got back in the car after about six hours, when my iPhone paired with my stereo, it started playing from Music again.
