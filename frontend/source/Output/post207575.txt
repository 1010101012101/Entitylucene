iOS 9.0.1 update fails to update <body> My iPhone 6 won't let me download iOS 9.0.1. I tried downloading it once and it said error occurred, failed to update as it said preparing update.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/izi61.jpg" width="270"  So I did it again and deleted some storage in case it was that but its still not working!  How to resolve this issue?  <comment250443> It would be helpful if we could know exactly what the error message was. <comment250470> Is there a reason why you don't connect to iTunes and perform a non over the air update? <comment250583> Is this the error message you are getting? <comment256306> iOS is the most unstable thing to upgrade ever. Just use the older version until more time has passed to save yourself trouble from data loss and bricked phones.
