How can I delete a picture from my Photos app on iPad? <body> So far I can only delete pictures from iPhoto.  How can I delete a picture from my Photos app on iPad?  <answer31770> Open the "Photos" view and press the Sharing button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OjaJ9.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can then select one or more photos and delete them:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2pkK0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment36442> I see, but the delete button is disabled. And I can see is disabled in r picture as well. <comment36478> Hmm, interesting. Seems you can't delete pictures suitable as backgrounds/wallpapers (button stays disabled). And to make it even more interesting, the button turns black if you first select a wallpaper image and another one (which you can delete) afterwards. <comment36538> I can't delete any of mine. Probably because I've imported them from the mac, and not just taken them from iPad or iPhone
