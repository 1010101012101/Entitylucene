Remove partition failed - the partition is gone, but now there is missing space. How do I get it back? <body> I was trying to get rid of an old Bootcamp partition I didn't want anymore. I followed these instructions to remove a partition using Disk Utility, but the removal failed. Now the partition is gone, but the space it used to occupy hasn't been merged back to the main disk partition - it's just emgone/em. My SSD is 1 TB, but Macintosh HD is only 775 GB, the same as it used to be.  What happened to this extra space and how can I get it back? And why did it leave me in this weird half-removed position instead of removing the partition properly?  Here's what my Disk Utility looks like now:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9mqct.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's what comes up when I enter "diskutil list":  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE        IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            774.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE        IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +774.3 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  8679E121-03C8-47B0-844E-961A437E5CA5                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  <answer282508> ul liBackup your main volume./li liOpen Terminal.app/li liCheck the file system integrity of your main partition: codediskutil verifyVolume disk0s2/code/li liIf everything is fine, expand your logical volume group (and the inherent logical volume):  precodediskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID size /code/pre  In your case that's:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack 8679E121-03C8-47B0-844E-961A437E5CA5 0g /code/pre  If you run Sierra the magic size 0g may fail and you have to enter a distinctive size:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack 8679E121-03C8-47B0-844E-961A437E5CA5 999300m /code/pre  If you get an error like: emError: -69771: The target disk is too small for this operation/em choose a slightly smaller size like 999200m until you are successful./li liIf you get a different type of error, the whole (previous) Disk Utility operation failed and corrupted the internal structure of the LVG.

Unfortunately I'm not 100% sure and don't have the possibility to test it at this time. Perhaps someone else could confirm this? <comment355718> @Jules [Here's what I see when I do that](http://i.imgur.com/EeRAfTX.png)  Not sure how to reclaim the space this way because it's not seeing that extra space. <comment355730> Can you show us the info given when you type the command `diskutil list` in Terminal? <comment355861> @paper1111 Sure, added to the original post. <comment355891> @JM My answer to the question linked in your post is an answer to a different kind of problem. You should always delete a *BOOTCAMP* partition with the Boot Camp Assistant.
