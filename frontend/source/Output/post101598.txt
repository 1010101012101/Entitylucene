My Help Viewer says "The selected topic is currently unavailable"! <body> I just got this mac mini a week ago and I never succeeded to get the help viewer working correctly. The help viewer keeps saying "The selected topic is currently unavailable".  I did as explained here with no success.  I also enabled the debugging but i could not find where the console.log file is created.  I opened the help in safari to show you the message. When i click on "Browse the web", I get the message "[id not found: sfri35862]".  I hope someone can help me.  Thank you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SmLHd.png" alt="Safari help in help viewer and in Safari" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQ0gn.png" alt="After clicking on &quot;Browse the web&quot; in &quot;Essentials&quot;"  <comment119694> That happens to me quite often, I just retry few times till it works. (it has to go online to get help files) <comment119776> My mac is always online. I removed a few files as exaplined in the link I gave and the help viewer came back onmy after I rebooted. <comment119777> My Mac is always online as well, still the Help function sometimes does not connect to the online documents, so clicking again usually does it. (watch the little spinning wheel).
