Why does my MacBook Air 2013 wake from sleep every minute on Mavericks? <body> I'm having issues with my MacBook Air 2013 waking from sleep into Dark Wake every minute since I upgraded to Mavericks. Whenever it's been to sleep and goes into standby it keeps waking up. This is what codepmset -g log/code looks like:  precode2013-10-25 06:52:41 CEST DarkWake               DarkWake [CDN]  : Using BATT (Charge:60%)                                   45 secs    2013-10-25 06:53:26 CEST Assertions             PID 18(powerd) Released InternalPreventSleep "PM configd - Wait for Device enumeration" 00:00:45  id:0xe00001348 [System: No Assertions]               2013-10-25 06:53:26 CEST Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep: Using BATT (Charge:60%)                                  16 secs    2013-10-25 06:53:28 CEST SlowResponse           PMConnection: Response from com.apple.apsd is slow (powercaps:0x0)                    1996 ms        2013-10-25 06:53:28 CEST WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                    2013-10-25 06:53:42 CEST Assertions             PID 18(powerd) Created InternalPreventSleep "PM configd - Wait for Device enumeration" 00:00:00  id:0xe0000135c [System: No Assertions]            2013-10-25 06:53:42 CEST DarkWake               DarkWake [CDN]  : Using BATT (Charge:59%)                                   45 secs    2013-10-25 06:54:27 CEST Assertions             PID 18(powerd) Released InternalPreventSleep "PM configd - Wait for Device enumeration" 00:00:45  id:0xe0000135c [System: No Assertions]               2013-10-25 06:54:27 CEST Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep: Using BATT (Charge:59%)                                  18 secs    2013-10-25 06:54:29 CEST SlowResponse           PMConnection: Response from com.apple.apsd is slow (powercaps:0x0)                    1831 ms        2013-10-25 06:54:29 CEST WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                    2013-10-25 06:54:45 CEST Assertions             PID 18(powerd) Created InternalPreventSleep "PM configd - Wait for Device enumeration" 00:00:00  id:0xe0000136f [System: No Assertions] /code/pre  And so on throughout the entire night. The console says code2013-10-25 06:41:20,000 kernel[0]: Wake reason: ?/code for every wake, so I guess my only shot is trying to figure out what codeDarkWake [CDN]/code means which there doesn't seem to be any info on. Also, this is while the Mac is on battery and with codepmset -g darkwakes 0/code (I.e. Power Nap turned off for battery).  <answer107702> I am having the same issue with my Macbook Air 2013 since upgrading to Mavericks   SMC and PRAM reset did not solve the problem.    After 3 hours sleeping on battery, Mac tries to change from sleep to DeepSleep (hibernate) mode.  Then, constantly waking itself back up each minute afterwards until the battery drains to &lt;1%.  It has to be a bug on Apple side.    <answer108159> My workaround was to disable sleep using codesudo pmset -b standby 0/code. Not really a fix but a temporary workaround until I revisit the issue.  <comment125425> Have you attempted to [reset the SMC](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964) or [zap the PRAM](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379) to see if that helps? Do you have all external devices or other media (DVD/SD card) disconnected when testing (Created InternalPreventSleep "PM configd - Wait for device enumeration")? "InternalPreventSleep" may be an assertion that is preventing sleep? <comment125533> Did both of those, no dice. Nope, no external devices connected. <comment126341> My workaround was to disable sleep using `sudo pmset -b standby 0`. I thought it might be related to Better Touch Tool since it's gotten a bunch of "Mavericks compatibility" updates but I haven't tried re-enabling hibernate since those, the battery life is still great even without that. <comment126359> Rick, do you happen to be running a virtual machine of any kind in the background? I'm seeing the same issue as you and wondering whether that could be a culprit... <comment126768> @Rick Can you post this as an answer? <comment126814> Sure, but it's not really an answer as much as a temporary workaround. <comment126906> Nope, I hade no VMs. <comment139507> Is System Preferences / Energy Saver / Wake for network access checked? Maybe something pings your machine regularly or something similar is happening? <comment139511> Yes it's on but that only applies to when the power adapter is plugged in. This also happens regardless of what Wi-Fi I'm on and even with Wi-Fi turned off. <comment140329> Hey Rick, can you check if this still happens when you switch off Automatic Updates and Automatic App Downloads in System Preferences / App Store ? I have a sneaking suspicion it could theoretically be overdoing its software updates check since I'm seeing this behaviour on my Mac Mini server when I have caching server on, but none of this behaviour when it is off <comment140423> Nope, still not working. Also tried disabling push notifications which didn't help. I did however have a look at the assertions it's printing during sleep and they are DeclUser and kDisp. According to [PMAssertions.h](https://github.com/aosm/PowerManagement/blob/master/pmconfigd/PMAssertions.c) they are, respectively, kDeclareUserActivity and kIOPMDriverAssertionPreventDisplaySleepBit. Specifically the second one seems interesting, perhaps it's somehow driver related? <comment266529> I solved [similar issue](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/219675/rmbp-early-2015-wakes-from-sleep-every-minute) with setting MBP to always hibernate.
