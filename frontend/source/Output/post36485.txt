QuickLook doesn’t work with Chat transcript files <body> Trying to use QuickLook for Chat transcript files isn’t working anymore on my machine.   First it takes 10 seconds to load (for files &lt;20KB) - and then when it does finally load, it’s just an icon. I can’t actually read the chat.  Anybody else having this experience?  I’m not even quite sure what to try resetting! Deleting the QuickLook plists does not seem to have changed anything.  <answer36495> Might want to flush your various caches, specifically font caches - I like Cocktail and Lion Cache Cleaner for both.  <comment41505> What chat transcript? From iChat? From Adium? Is there a standard for chat transcript files? <comment41507> Have you installed any QuickLook plugins recently? <comment48629> Cleaning caches (I used Onyx) didn’t change anything. <comment48630> They’re iChat transcript files, and yes, I have installed some QuickLook plugins.
