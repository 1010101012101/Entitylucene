How can I open Windows network links on Mac OS X? <body> I started using a Mac recently in a workplace where most people use Windows. We share with each other links to work files that exist on some server here. So I may get a URL via email that looks like that code\\servername\folder\stuff.doc/code or even just a link to a folder like code\\servername\folder/code - clicking it results in an error on the Mac (Lion). Is there anything I can do so that clicking such network addresses will launch the document or folder?  <answer36446> I've used WinShortcutter in the past - seems to work OK. This will allow you to open Windows style UNC paths (\\servername\path\to\directory) when they appear in emails, etc.  <answer36447> Under the finder menu, choose 'Go' - 'Connect to Server'.  In the box that appears you need to type the path to the SMB server share.  SMB stands for Server Message Block, which windows understands.  The path would look like this...  smb://ServerName/SharedFolder  I have done this on OSX Tiger and Lion.  There are many tutorials available, such as this one on lifehacker  <answer36496> Also, if you connect to the local domain, you can configure UNC paths to work in Mac OS X.   You can connect to the domain by going to System PreferencesUsers &amp; GroupsLogin Options and click the Join button next to Network Account Server. Type in the name of the domain and press enter.   You can then click the Open Directory Utility button and select the Active Directory option and click the pencil button to edit. Verify that you are bound to the domain and click the Show Advanced Options button. Make sure that the Use UNC path from Active Directory to derive network home location is checked and select SMB as the network protocol to be used.   Hope this helps.   <answer193839> As far as I can tell from reading the documentation this setting for UNC paths in Directory Utility only works for using a UNC path from Active Directory to mount your network home directory.  It doesn't provide general UNC support. :-(  <answer224521> Run vim, paste your Windows link, then run the following commands  precode:%s/\\/\//g /code/pre    precode:%s/ /%20/g /code/pre  The first command will turn all code\/code (backslashes) into code//code (forward slashes) into.  The second will turn all spaces into the "%20" string needed for a Mac command.  Paste this jumble into Apple + K (Connect to Server) using the SMB feature.  <answer257126> Try putting "file:" before the address. It helped me with hyperlinks while working in side applications. They featured hyperlinks, but when I was giving them local computer address to a file on Mac it automatically would launch web browser showing the page cannot be viewed. With "file:" in the beginning of the address link it opens the file with the designated software, not even showing it in Finder.  <answer288994> You can get access only with IP like . you need to check IP of window and run that ip on your browser you will get that system from mac..  <comment41461> The windows server has to be configured to allow sharing with the Mac. I suggest doing a google search on how to do this. <comment41475> I know how I can manually get to these addresses, but my question was about just launching links in the Windows format on Mac.
