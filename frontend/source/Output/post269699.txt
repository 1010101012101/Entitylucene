What can I use to get dust off of my rMBP display? <body> I've noticed that the Retina display on MacBook Pros gets scratches and dings very easily.  I just recently had to replace the display for a different reason, and I'd like to put on a tempered glass screen protector to prevent scratches and dings.  The problem is that I need to make sure that the screen is completely clean and dust-free before installing the screen protector, which I've found is very difficult to do.  I'm wondering if there are any products that I could buy to help get dust off of the screen?  Would something like an electronics brush or maybe even a camera lens brush work?  Please let me know!  Thanks.  <answer269707> I recommend this $13 iKlear Screen Cleaning Bundle.   It cleans dust and grime off of any modern screen (including iPhones and Macbooks) really well and I've been using it happily for the past few years. It comes with a chamois cloth and some special spray that cleans off dust very well without harming the screen (or you—it doesn't irritate skin in my experience).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SC8Kb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with iKlear in any way.  <comment338846> Did my answer help? If it's right—be sure to hit the checkmark to accept it! If it's not—comment below it and I'll be happy to help more! <comment338854> I agree with owlsipe! You can also use iKlear or any glasses/computer screen cleaner and microfiber cloth to clean the outside of the computer! (It makes it look like new!) <comment338855> Is that $1 for the microfibre & $12 for the packaging & snake oil? ;) There's very little that a damp microfibre won't get clean, no isopropyl needed. <comment338918> @NoahL Thanks :). I've even used it on a huge TV and it worked great!! <comment338919> @Tetsujin Well, the snake oil works great! I'm sure just a cloth works pretty well too, but I use and love this magic stuff. <comment338920> Have you actually compared it to just a damp micro, or better still one damp one dry? <comment338923> @Tetsujin Just did a three-way test on my dirty screen (divided it into three parts), and I can confirm snake juice was ever so slightly better than with water and significantly better than dry (all + microfiber cloth), though the differences are too minimal to appear on camera. Still, the iKlear was fastest at removing the stuff and it looks exactly perfect. I stand by my recommendation, though water did work pretty well too :D <comment338927> Sure, the isoprop is likely to be slightly faster... but no more thorough & 12 bucks more expensive... I'll stick with water ;) [& yeah, they're useless dry unless the surface is still slightly damp from the first cloth, if you use the 2-cloth method]
