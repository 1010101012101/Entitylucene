Watch PBS videos while in Spain using Proxy <body> First of all sorry if this was asked and answered already.  I am currently on a trip in Spain (but originally from USA), and would like to watch some PBS videos, but it tells me      We're sorry, but this video is not available in your region due to   right restrictions.   OK, I get it, so let me tell PBS I am in their region by changing my Proxy!  I tried the:  FoxyProxy add on in Firefox with no success.  My question is:  There is a setting in the System Preferances-Network-Advaced-Proxy!  I am not sure how to use it to get the PBS to play the video. I tried with a proxy from USA CA and still the same error message!  PS: yes, I did sign in in to PBS :(  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ALxvr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer118829> It appears that the PBS video is transported via codehttp/code, but there are other resources on that page that connect via codehttps/code. You may also need to establish an https proxy as well. In your screenshot, you only have an http proxy set up.
