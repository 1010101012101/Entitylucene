How to parse output from a command in OS X Automator? <body> I have the following code in Automator but it fails to load the variable with the output from the command.  precodefor f in "$@" do     output = hdiutil verify "$f"     echo "$output"  done /code/pre  I want to parse the output of that to see if it's verified or not however the variable is coming back empty.  <answer151787> precodeoutput=$(hdiutil verify "$f") echo "$output" /code/pre  <comment178586> How are you declaring a variable with the @ symbol?  Can you post how your variables are defined. <comment178590> @tron $@ is how Automator passes input to shell scripts. <comment178875> No, this still results in an empty variable. <comment178878> @iceberg Oops, fixedâ€”had spaces either side of the equals.
