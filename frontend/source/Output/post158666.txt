Where can I see all the learned/ignored spelling in Pages 5.5? <body> I've added some words that are not in the standard Apple dictionary in Pages 5.5 via the 'learn'/'ignore spelling' function.   Is there any way where I can see a comprehensive list of the words that I have added to the 'learn'/'ignore' list?  Thanks.  <answer158679> Your custom words spelling are stored in  ~/Library/Spelling/  just copy the code~/Library/Spelling//code and paste in Finder Go to Folder window.  Then open this file  codeLocalDictionary/code file  <comment187042> Glad to be of Help :)
