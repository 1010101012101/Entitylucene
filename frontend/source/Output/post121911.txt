Kill GUI "zombie" <body> This is not actually zombie in UNIX terms, but I don't know name of this process.  On my Mavericks 10.9.1 some GUI application has been badly crashed and I can't run it again except I should logout (reboot?) and login again.  codeps gauxwww/code shows it as "(AppName)", in codeApplication Monitor/code I see application codeAppName/code with icon which consumes code0/code(zero) of any resources. Parent PID is code1/code.  Killing it with code-KILL/code or with any other signal doesn't help at all, I can "run" application: icon will jump on Dock, and I can't do anything at all except codeForce Quit/code with no quitting that "zombie".  What should I do without reboot my mac to rid out that process?  strongUPD:/strong there's no such process in codespindump/code or same utilities. What the hell are such processes?  <comment142219> did you do a virus check <comment142221> If you have an app running on your computer, it has to reside somewhere on the disk. I would monitor the Console to see if I can catch it in action. <comment142254> I can't reproduce it when I want to. There may be some deadlock or endless waiting for resource cause this problem. <comment204372> I reproduce the problem and ask a question before finding your post: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/173717/killing-an-application <comment270544> @MartinDelille, I had this problem with `Maverics` only. It has been gone with `Yosemite` release.
