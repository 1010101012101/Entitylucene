iBooks Author Latex Question <body> Any idea how would you go about drawing a 3x3 matrix in iBooks Author?  My Latex formula which works on other platforms is  $$\left[\begin{array}{ c c c }1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \2 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \ 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\end{array} \right]$$  iBooks simply says "invalid equation".  Cheers  Nick  <answer196820> iBooks Author only supports a subset of LaTeX, see iBooks Author: About LaTeX and MathML support for a full list of supported commands.  From looking at the samples in the support document, something like   precode\begin{matrix} 1 &amp;  1 &amp;  1 \\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp;  1 \\ 1 &amp;  2 &amp; -1 \\ \end{matrix} /code/pre  should work.
