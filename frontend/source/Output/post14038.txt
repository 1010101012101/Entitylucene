Change the year of 500+ photos in iPhoto <body> For quite some time I had my camera configured with the wrong year. How can I change the year portion of the date of 500+ photos in my iPhotos library?  <answer14040> In iPhoto '09 (or later, I believe)...  ol liSelect all the photos with incorrect dates/li liIn the menu bar, select Photos - Adjust Date and Time/li liModify the date to reflect the change you want -- for example, to shift all the photos forward one year, increment just the year part of the date by 1/li liAll the photos will be time-shifted by the relative change you specified/li /ol  <comment15065> Wow, that was easy! <comment15068> @bitbonk Glad I was able to help! <comment15613> Actually, there is one problem with this: The event that the photos belong to, do not pick up the change. The date of the event is still one year off (in the future). <comment15631> @bitbonk I believe iPhoto events take their dates from the photos they contain, so double-check to make sure *all* photos have the correct date.  If you're still having trouble, that's not strictly on-topic for this particular question (you asked about photos, not events), so I'd recommend creating a new question.
