Where is Remote Desktop Connection for Mac in Office 2011? <body> I've just installed Office for Mac 2001 (v14.3.3), on this page (http://www.microsoft.com/mac/remote-desktop-client) it says "Remote Desktop Connection for Mac 2 is included with every edition of Office for Mac 2011." but I can't find it anywhere.  <answer88531> Well in my case it is right here  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eEHpQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  In your case it might be waiting for you in the "Downloads folder" to be installed. If not get it from MS here http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1350  <comment103645> If it's not in Additional Tools (use spotlight to search for it), you can [download it for free from Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/search.aspx?q=microsoft%20remote%20desktop%20connection%20for%20mac&p=0&r=10&t=&s=Relevancy~Descending). <comment103650> Same for me as the above poster. The RDC app is written to the root of ~\Applications. <comment103671> It looks like the 2 answers came at same time :). @Dave you are correct if it comes as part of the Office, but if it is downloaded as stand alone, it goes in the download folder first.
