Why are some iTunes Store songs marked as CLEAN when no EXPLICIT version exists? <body> I have downloaded a number of items from the iTunes store which are marked as CLEAN.  I understand this is common in tracks (I'm looking at you, rappers!) where an EXPLICIT song has has the swear words removed or bleeped or reversed etc.  However, the tracks I have are the original recordings, and are not clean versions of tracks that were originally explicit:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jqL94.png" alt="enter image description here"  What makes iTunes decide to add these flags to certain songs, and what is the point of a CLEAN tag?  In the example given every track is marked as clean, but I have seen it on individual songs also.  <answer39636> This is a hypothesis, but I expect it's because those songs have been explicitly (no pun intended) listened to by iTunes staff to make sure there aren't swears or R references. Another possibility is that artists, when submitting content to the Store, have the ability to flag them this way, and often do so even when no explicit version exists.  <answer43658> I just had a look at differently tagged files.  The responsible ID3-tag is codertng/code (short for coderating/code). If set to code1/code the song will be marked as codeEXPLICIT/code, while code2/code shows up as codeCLEAN/code. Every other value leads to no label.  I recommend Kid3 as a tag editor.  EDIT: According to this and this, the values should be code2/code (CLEAN) and code4/code (EXPLICIT). I can't reproduce those, maybe someone copied it wrong...  <comment44760> Since these are hypotheses, should it be a comment instead?
