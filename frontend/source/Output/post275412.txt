x264/VLC Broadwell/Skylake GPU acceleration <body> I have a 2015 MacBook Pro, with a Core i5 Broadwell processor. One of the things that stood out to me was the CPU efficiency of multimedia playbackâ€”at least when using first party Apple libraries. This includes iTunes, Quicktime, and MPEG4/h.264 HTML5 video player in Safari.  Is there a version of x264 that supports the new Intel instructions for GPU-accelerated codecs, in particular in a version that VLC can use? Or is there a way to configure VLC to use the Apple Quicktime codec library for h.264 and M4A?
