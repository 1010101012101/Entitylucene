If he can't discover the password that way then lets say he guesses it because the passcode is really simple.  <answer278129> SIP itself is not an issue, since that requires physical presence to disable (to wit: rebooting the machine into recovery mode and running a terminal command). strongAt no point during the process of changing SIP settings is your account password required./strong  However, there's an old adage in computer security: If someone has physical access to your computer, it isn't your computer anymore.   If a remote hacker has your account password, they could access various network services if they can reach the ports, get an SSH shell, impersonate you, and so forth.
