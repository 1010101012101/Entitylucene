Is it possible to recover a lost stickies note? <body> I use Stickies very much, and some of them are very lengthy and important to me.  Suddenly I lost a sticky which contained crucial information I need to recover. I don't know why it doesn't appear anymore since I don't remember closing it without saving.  Is there any way to recover past stickies? Thank you  <answer139471> I do not know how to solve this problem, but you can use yellow. It is similar to stickies but you can retrieve what you deleted (unless you delete that). Hope this can prevent future mishaps.  <comment164444> Does @cacosomoza have a TimeMachine backup? <comment164446> No, I don't have Time Machine :(
