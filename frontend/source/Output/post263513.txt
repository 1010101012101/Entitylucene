How can I listen to a whole album on iTunes? <body> I can not listen to a whole album on iTunes, I have tried "ticking or checking all the songs in my library" and preferences/unchecking the list view check boxes. nothing works. Can anyone help me please?  <answer263540> Assuming you are using a Mac with a newer system and the latest iTunes do the following:  ol liGo to Album view  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i78Ve.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNow move the cursor to an album which will "enable" a play button in the lower right corner. Hit the play button to play all songs of this album:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EFkCL.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liIf you click once more on the album you will see the content of the album:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bc1WL.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liTo see the content of another album click on it - this won't interrupt the playback of the first album:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W7jru.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liTo play the second album either   ul limove the cursor over the second album and click on the then enabled play button /li limove the cursor over the cover of the "expanded" album and click on the then visible bigger blue-on-white play button/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4qAok.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul limove the cursor over one of the titles of the "expanded" album and click on the then visible small blue play button/li /ul/li /ol  <comment330127> Reading the manual of a new device or the help topics related to new software should be the first task of a customer before ranting to the manufacturer. <comment330156> Your comment was not very helpful, thank you however for taking the time to write a useless answer. Ive already read the threads and done what it was suggested on them and it has not worked. From a customer and a product manager point of view, changing the functions of a program/ software forcing the customer to study the manual of a product is hardly an improvement. FYI I am  not the only person with this problem. <comment330161> I wanted to express that 2/3 of your question was a rant at Apple - which isn't very helpful here at apple.stackexchange. Make a complaint in an Apple Store or write to Apple's customer support. You should have added details like your Apple device, your system and iTunes version to your question instead. I will write an answer which is helpful. And Apple's solution to play whole albums is adequately intuitive.
