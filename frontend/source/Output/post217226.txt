New emojis don't show on Mac, only on iPhone <body> The new emojis don't appear as a valid character. They appear as a rectangle in Messages on my Mac. On the iPhone I can see the emoji fine.  My software is 10.10.5. How can I download the new emojis on mac?  This Emoji appears on my phone but not on my Mac:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vKY8n.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer217240> You need Mac OS X 10.11.1 (El Capitan) on your Mac to see the new emojis.  <answer217241> are you upgraded to the latest ios and osx versions? if you text those emojis to people not upgraded, they will see the boxes.  <comment262618> Your Question is not specific. What emoji character? What version of iOS? What version of Mac OS X? What apps? <comment262658> One everyone missed - What Mac, how old? It might be "up to date" but if it's an old enough machine, that could be because it cannot run anything newer. <comment262730> It's a mid 2012 mac. <comment262734> Can you fix your hyperlink? <comment262751> Version 10.10.5
