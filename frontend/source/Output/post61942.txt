Uninstall Lua from OS X 10.6.8 <body> I was browsing the Lua source code and I did "make install". It worked perfectly but I could not uninstall it! How can I install Lua 5.0?  <answer62262> Based on my reading of Lua 5.0's makefile, I'd say:  ol liRun codemake echo/code, and note the folders codeINSTALL_BIN/code, codeINSTALL_INC/code, codeINSTALL_LIB/code, and codeINSTALL_MAN/code/li liFor each file in codebin/code, remove that file from codeINSTALL_BIN/code/li liFor each file in codeinclude/code named code*.h/code, remove that file from codeINSTALL_INC/code/li liFor each file in codelib/code named code*.a/code, remove that file from codeINCLUDE_LIB/code/li liFor each file in codedoc/code named code*.1/code, remove that file from codeINCLUDE_MAN/code/li liUpgrade to Lua 5.2 so if you accidentally install again, you can uninstall  :-)/li /ol  strongAlternatively/strong: if you download Lua 5.2 and configure it in exactly the same way (so all the INSTALL_* folders are the same), then its codemake uninstall/code will delete almost all of these for you.  You only have to delete codeliblualib.a/code from codeINCLUDE_LIB/code.  <comment71542> Why can't you uninstall it?  What happens if you `make uninstall`? <comment71847> @Ken it says that there is not a target for uninstall <comment71936> Weird, I guess they only added uninstall in version 5.2.
