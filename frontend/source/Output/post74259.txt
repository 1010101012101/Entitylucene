Can I use Google CardDAV sync on my Mac? <body> Is it possible for me to use Google's excellent CardDAV contact sync service on my OS X (10.8) computer?  It works very well on iOS, but the same settings do not work on a computer.  <answer74266> The emAccounts/em tab of the emContacts/em preferences give you an option to add a CardDAV acount:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d39XT.png" alt=""  Simply use that. If that doesn't work for you, please post a more specific problem description.  <answer81569> Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like CardDAV sync feature is only avaliable from iOS devices. I did however find an article showing how you can do so on your mac, it could be worth a try.     After opening Contacts, go to the app’s preferences pane. Navigate to   the “Accounts” section:   http://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/2012-12-16-google-contacts-1.pngbr   Hit the plus sign to add an account. Here are the required settings:br   Account type: CardDAV:br   Username: Your Gmail Accountbr   Your passwordbr   Server address: google.com      Hit the “Create” button:   http://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/2012-12-16-google-contacts-2.pngbr   Contacts.app will then ask if you want use these credentials for other   types of information. Select what you wish and press the “Create”   button again.      Once the account is listed in Contact.app’s preferences, go to the   “General” section and set your Google account to be the default   account:   http://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/2012-12-16-google-contacts-3.png      By default, the application defaults to saving vCards locally on the   Mac, which means information added from other programs won’t end up in   the Google cloud.   <answer82365> Yes. I use it on Mountain Lion.  Details here:http://tech.kateva.org/2013/02/google-contact-sync-on-mountain-lion.html.  It's not clear to me how Contacts.app is merging Google/iCloud duplicates that arise if you use iCloud, or handling editing of those duplicates. There's no support for Google Group/Tag relationships or Mac Group/Tag relationships.  Nobody has gotten it working on Snow Leopard, though if you want to try that (do publish) Hsiaoi's technique is a good start (http://www.hsiaoi.com/blog/?p=512). I suspect SSL is a problem.  I believe it also works on Lion but I've not tested.  <comment86258> On Snow Leopard, I had to use iSync to sync Google contacts with the Address Book. You might want to try that, too. <comment86273> This option doesn't work, unfortunately. I had tried this option, and also mentioned it in my question. <comment86274> You weren't very specific about that. How exactly "doesn't it work"? <comment86276> I receive this error message when trying to set it up: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/99068c76-b570-4798-a452-ecbe90c3d0a7/2599ab03251d41005de5c2362bec9bf1 <comment86358> @str iSync was removed with Mountain Lion :( <comment94045> That last tip about setting it as the default was what I needed, as recently CardDAV started working. Many thanks! <comment94046> You're welcome! :) <comment95047> I've just done it, and its working in OSX 10.8.2, But I configured it in System Preferences - Mail contacts & Calendars - add other accont - CardDAV.
