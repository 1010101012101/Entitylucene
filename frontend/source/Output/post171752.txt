iOS Simulator installed app location in Xcode 6.1 <body> I am trying to locate the actual location of app installed on iOS Simulator. I am using OSX 10.9.4 with Xcode 6.1  Already tried looking Application Support folder but can't find the simulator location. Tried a bunch of different locations as well, but can't find anything. Any ideas where can I find it or where should I look in apple documentation regarding this? Any pointers will be appreciated.   <answer171755> After some more research I figured out that Apple changed it to be inside code~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/code  Based on the ID of device, we can now go into that folder and find the code.app/code file.   <answer171783> Easiest way: Use SimPholders2. It's a little utility that lets you:  ul liAccess all application folders from status item menu/li liQuickly reset app storage by deleting files in Library and Documents (kbd⌃/kbd + Click)/li liDetailed information of file size and number of items in app bundle (kbd⇧/kbd)/li liLaunch app directly in iPhone Simulator/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NeiEx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer186315> For newer Xcode's (including 6.1) follow below steps to see the installed apps (.app) location   ol liRight click Xcode.app./li liGo to 'Show Contents'./li liNavigate to this part of the file path: Contents  Developer  Platforms  iPhoneSimulator.platform  Developer  SDKs  iPhoneSimulator8.1.sdk  Applications/li /ol  Here will show all installed .app list.   Besides if you want to install new .app on simulator, just drag and drop .app to this location.  <answer192239> If you want to create a shortcut to the simulator app, you can do the following:  ol liControl-click xcode.app in Applications and select "Show Package Contents"/li liNavigate to: Contents/Developer/Applications/li liControl-click iOS Simulator.app and select "Make Alias", or just drag it to the dock to create an alias there. /li /ol  I'm using OS 10.9.5 and xCode 6.1.1  <comment202126> Please put your answer as an edit to your original question. Thanks! <comment202538> Although I haven't mentioned in the question, I don't want to use any external utility :)
