Terminal: disable printing/output of keyboard commands <body> I have the same problem as this person â€“ I am running a C script and somehow when I pass the EOF signal with Ctrl+D, code^D/code gets printed to the console.  My question is therefore: is it possible to disable outputting code^D/code and code^C/code and the like whenever you press Ctrl+D/Ctrl+C?  Thanks in advance for any suggestions!
