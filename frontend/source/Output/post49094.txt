Please recommend a good technical design tool for iPad or OS X <body> I'm looking for a tool that will allow me to create isometric and flattened designs. I'm looking for an application that allows designing of engineering projects for wood working.  I've spent a lot of money looking for an app but most are tools for sketching and artwork orientated.  Some features I'm really looking for are:  ul liEasy to use/li liIsometric and flat views for same design to be shown/li liVector based design, allowing me to resize, move objects individually/li liMeasurement and scale support, allowing me to specify a scale and then size elements based on that scale (in metric notation)/li liLayers support would be preferred to allow measurements to be supplied on a separate layer/li /ul  I don't want an overly complex tool, I just want a nice tool to do the job of creating designs alleviating the need for me to use pencil and paper.  <answer49095> codeiDesk/code seems to fit into your criteria. It is a cool iPad app that is more toward diagrams and vector graphics than sketching. It has a very nice interface, too. It has a killer feature that is when you draw a shape (circle, triangle,...) it recognizes it and changes it to the vector form.  Update: I recently found codeiDraw/code which blew me away with its abilities in vector graphics. Some even describe it as the illustrator on iOS. You might wanna give it a try.  iDraw: http://www.indeeo.com/idraw  iDesk: http://www.tentouchapps.com/idesk  <answer49098> If you haven't already, check out Google Sketchup. I don't think its on iOS yet, but it is lovely in its simplicity, short learning curve and flexibility. There are tons of YouTube clips showing off features and tutorials.  <answer57131> Hexagon from DAZ 3D works well for me, and is simple enough that after an hour I could do some fun things.  <comment65601> Thanks for your answer, Everett!
