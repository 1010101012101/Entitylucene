Cannot kill process shown in parenthesis <body> I started a rather long codedd/code command that I would like to stop.  codeps/code shows:  precode$ ps   PID TTY           TIME CMD  2006 ttys002    0:00.00 (dd) /code/pre  The codedd/code process is shown in parenthesis without the argument.  A codekill/code produces no effect. Any idea on how to interrupt it?  <answer225022> This is a zombie process. Here's how to get rid of it from this answer on superuser:          strongSadly/strong, it appears that killing of zombies is all about strongkilling the parent/strong, and if the parent is code/sbin/launchd/code, you can kill it only with rebooting.         It would be a Very Bad Idea to kill codelaunchd/code, but you can tell it to HUP.      Try codesudo kill -s HUP 1/code      That will cause launchd to reinitialize without restarting. This has worked for me in the past (wrt. removing zombie entries).   <answer225033> The actual display of a process between code(â€¦)/code means this process was detached from its controlling terminal (here codettys002/code). This means that code^C/code, code^\/code, code^S/code, code^Z/code don't have anymore effect on it. It's behaving in emdaemon/em mode. This also means you can't send it a hangup either.  The correct way to deal with this case if unwanted, is to get the number of its parent process with:  precodeps lw | egrep '[ ](2006|PID)' /code/pre  and kill it with a hangup signal:  precodekill -HUP xxxx /code/pre  where xxxx is the process ID of the parent process.  <comment273038> Are you sure? Zombie processes should be marked with a `Z` and in this case the `dd` process finished and was removed in the process table, <comment273039> What does `ps aux` shows in STAT column? <comment273040> The process finished after one hour (and produced the correct output) and I cannot check anymore ... <comment273042> I don't know the other reason why process could not be killed and is shown in parenthesis in `ps` command. Maybe someone else have a clue. <comment273052> Yes, but I answered too late. <comment273053> @Mateusz: this wasn't a zombie, this was a daemon, and I won't be able to help understand why. <comment273055> Sure: directly in the shell `dd if=/dev/urandom of=somefile size=...`
