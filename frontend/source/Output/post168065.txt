Is it possible to override the SD Card write protection setting in software? <body> I'm using the built-in SD card reader on a Macbook Pro (15", late 2011) running Yosemite, and it treats every SD card as write-protected regardless of the position of the physical switch on the card.  Apparently this is a fairly common problem. I've already tried all the solutions given in this question, with no success. The only thing left that I can think of to try is making physical repairs to the drive. Since this problem is likely caused by a malfunctioning sensor for a setting I don't care about, that seems like overkill if there is a way to do it in software.  Is there any known way to tell the drive or the OS to ignore the write-protection setting and treat a protected SD card as writeable?  <answer295933> strongNo.  You cannot override the write protection status of an SD Card via software./strong  The read/write status is handled by the firmware of the SD card host controller not by the driver.  From Toshiba (manufacturer of these chips):     Content protection can be realized by using the [controller] with   firmware.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/odnol.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Inside the SD card reader are a series of pins that get connected if the write protection is enabled.  This tells the controller that write protection is enabled (Picture is not of the MacBook connectors, but the best one to illustrate how it works I could find online).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3GRqe.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  It is most likely that these pins are "stuck" together causing the controller to "see" the card as protected.  You can attempt to clean it out or as a better alternative, just purchase an inexpensive USB SD Card Reader.  <comment197133> buy a can of contact cleaner. 5 quid/bucks/shekels from Maplins/Radio Shack etc. Power down first. <comment197137> @Tetsujin First thing I tried. Problem persists. <comment197138> one SD card, all, or random? <comment197143> All SD cards I've tried. Used to be intermittent, now it's every time. <comment197144> Then I'd still think it's the contacts, or possibly the internal connection <comment343380> @Tetsujin Reviving this because I see this is a well propagated misconception: It's not the contacts. The SD card lock is a mechanical switch that has no electronic connection to the rest of the card. You can find out for yourself by [looking inside a card](https://www.flickr.com/photos/124330160/2452663566). It's up to the system to decide to respect the read-only position or not. So this question remains an interesting problem waiting for a solution. <comment343401> @Duvrai - I never considered it to be the card's contacts that were dirty, but the switch on the reader. The tiny slider on the side of the card is like an old floppy disk lock, not connected to anything, merely a marker to be tested by the reader.
