change bash color profile on su $username <body> With my useraccount I use a code.bash_profile/code that contains this line:br codeexport PS1='\[\e[0;36m\]\u\[\e[0m\]@\[\e[0;33m\]\h\[\e[0m\]:\[\e[0;33m\]\w\[\e[0m\]\$ '/code  With my adminaccount I use a code.bash_profile/code that contains this line:br codeexport PS1='\[\e[0;31m\]\u\[\e[0m\]@\[\e[0;33m\]\h\[\e[0m\]:\[\e[0;33m\]\w\[\e[0m\]\$ '/code  So basically useraccountname=blue, adminaccountname=red    However when I'm on my useraccount and change users with codesu adminaccount/code it doesn't change the color to red, only when I'm really logged in into adminaccount it is red right from the start of codeTerminal.app/code. How can i change this?  <comment224711> What happens when you type `sudo bash`? <comment224782> it switches user to root but not the colors <comment224783> it works when i type `su - adminaccount`
