How do I disable iMessage on every computer I installed with my email address? <body> I have two multiple Macs. 2 Macbooks and an iMac. I installed El Capitan on all of them, with my one iTunes account.  The issue I am running into is that whenever I get a message on iMessage, it shows up on all computers and my iPad...not just my iPhone (and my Macbook) -- which is what I want.  How do I fix that?  <answer248753> Though I don't believe there's any way to do a broad-sweep method, you can disable it on a case-by-case basis on OS X and iOS.  strongOS X/strong  Open the Messages app, then in the menu bar hit Messages - Preferences. Click on the Accounts button, then your iMessage account in the sidebar. Uncheck the box labeled "Enable this account."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j1KWD.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongiOS/strong  Go to Settings - Messages and turn iMessage off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kkvlp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment308511> Perfect.
