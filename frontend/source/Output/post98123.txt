What is the Applescript command to show or hide iTerm2 window <body> Does anybody know the Applescript command to show or hide a iTerm2 terminal window? I use iTerm2 in a guake style command window and currently using one window and many tabs.  My use case: I managed to open a new iTerm2 tab from Forklift (see here) but I still need to activate iTerm2 manually with my show/hide shortcut.  <answer98132> Here are several options (none of them have been tested, so test and see which one works for you):  h2Option 1:/h2  precodetell application "iTerm2" to activate tell application "System Events" to tell process "iTerm2" to keystroke "h" using command down /code/pre  Note: Keystroke may be replaced with emm/em if you want iTerm2 to be emminimized/em to the dock with the Genie effect.  h2Option 2:/h2  precodetell application "Finder" set visible of process "iTerm2" to false end tell  /code/pre  h2Option 3:/h2  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "iTerm2" to set visible to false /code/pre  Note: The process name may just be strongiTerm/strong instead of iTerm2. I opened iTerm on my Mac and then codeActivity Monitor/code, and the codeProcess Name/code that it shows is codeiTerm/code. Please change accordingly if it does not work for you.  h2Links and Resources/h2  Here is a great WikiBooks link that describes exactly what you need.  Please let me know which option works for you so I can edit the question and only include the option that works.  h2Edit:/h2  If you make the iTerm window the frontmost application (Be careful you don't want to make the AppleScript window the frontmost application), try this script:   precodetell application "System Events"     set frontProcess to first process whose frontmost is true     set visible of frontProcess to false end tell /code/pre  <answer98174> precodetell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)     if name is "iTerm" then         set visible to false         return     end if end tell tell application "iTerm"     reopen -- open a default window if there are no open windows     activate -- make frontmost end tell /code/pre  If others were looking for a way to show or hide iTerm in general, you can set a shortcut for it in the preferences or use Alfred:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S5YkP.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/peVnB.jpg" alt=""  <answer143832> I tried every of this solution. None if them worked as expected. They all opened a completely new terminal or did not worked. The only solution which worked for me in the full screen iTerm Hotkey Window was to simulate keypresses.  Be sure to disable codeHotkey toggles a dedicated window with profile/code in settings or you need to simulate even that hotkey press which caused the major pain for my problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l5YI3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Here is the file code/Applications/ForkLift.app/Contents/Resources/OpenInTerminal.applescript/code which:  ul liopens my fullscreen terminal app, opens a new session window (my session is named codeHot/code, change it to codeDefault/code or your desired session type from profiles)/li liwaits for 1 second (otherwise the new session is not recognized)/li lichanges the directory and clears screen/li /ul  hr  precodetell application "iTerm"     activate      try         tell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal" to keystroke "t" using command down         delay 1         set _session to current session of current terminal     on error         set _term to (make new terminal)         tell _term             launch session "Hot"             set _session to current session         end tell     end try      tell _session         write text "cd _forklift_path_placeholder_;clear;"     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer281659> codetell application "iTerm2" to activate     set miniaturized of window 1 to true end tell /code http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=12501  the wording of your question makes me think you want individual windows out of the way. The hide function on mac will hide everything. I needed a window away from view. the url above was helpful.  your solution may not be hiding a single window but rather minimizing a single window.  <comment115172> tested both. Both do not work. iTerm2 is activated but the terminal window only shows after pressing the shortcut key. Thanks for the try. <comment115173> What version of OS X are you running?
