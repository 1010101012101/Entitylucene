Mac pre-installed apps not starting up (seen on multiple mac systems) <body> So I've seen this problem on a number of different mac systems as far back as an older MBP from 2010,  and seen on macOS as far back as Mountain Lion.  It starts intermittently then starts to happen across all the pre-installed mac OS apps one app at a time....  Simply put, I click on the application to start... I see some quick blip on the screen, then nothing ... the app refuses to start.  The ONLY fix I have found for the problem is to go to the recovery partition and reinstall a  fresh copy of the OS which works for a while... till it starts to happen again.  I have spend  good three to four hours with mac support (tier 3 level) and didn't really get any where...  when I check the console for any errors the only thing I come up with is this type of error...(one included here is for the latest version of this bug...Now it happens with the app store on this MBP, and I'm only trying to upgrade to ElCap or Sierra...don't care which)  precodeDec 17 02:23:08 rbs-macbook-pro App Store[373] &lt;Warning&gt;: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting Dec 17 02:24:18 rbs-macbook-pro storeagent[227] &lt;Critical&gt;: SoftwareMap: Software map rebuild took 0.0151 seconds for 2 records and produced: {         "/Applications/Battery Health.app" = "&lt;CKSoftwareProduct: 0x7fb68a6117e0&gt;: (com.fiplab.batteryhealth, 5.3, 490192174:816781516 VPP:NO source:LaunchPad /Applications/Battery Health.app) ";         "/Applications/Memory Clean.app" = "&lt;CKSoftwareProduct: 0x7fb68a611e70&gt;: (com.fiplab.memoryclean, 6.2, 451444120:817335553 VPP:NO source:LaunchPad /Applications/Memory Clean.app) ";     } Dec 17 02:24:44 rbs-macbook-pro App Store[396] &lt;Warning&gt;: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting Dec 17 02:24:47 rbs-macbook-pro App Store[398] &lt;Warning&gt;: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting Dec 17 02:24:49 rbs-macbook-pro App Store[400] &lt;Warning&gt;: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting Dec 17 02:28:04 rbs-macbook-pro App Store[421] &lt;Warning&gt;: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting Dec 17 02:28:07 rbs-macbook-pro App Store[423] &lt;Warning&gt;: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting /code/pre  So I'm going to set this mac up to work on a clean fresh install on mavericks and maybe the app store will run long enough to upgrade it....  this I can try in about 2 hours... the time it takers to redownload and install a fresh Mavericks ( so sick of htis time sink!!)  any advice??  <comment332527> This guy had the same problem and did a complete clean install. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/168805/unable-to-load-nib-file-mainmenu-please-help Did you erase your harddisk before the clean install? <comment332529> What else is common to the Macs that need a reinstall or become broken?
