Is it possible to have Text annotations in Preview's sidebar for a PDF? <body> A super-handy sidebar in Preview is "Highlights &amp; Notes". I wish it would also show my annotations that are texts. I prefer to use Texts (created using command-option-T) over Notes because they are visible without having to click on them. To retrieve my "Texts" I am lost; scanning thru many hundreds of pages is not my idea of fun. This was noted here before.  Failing this functionality or workaround in Preview I might use Skim as it was recommended here before.
