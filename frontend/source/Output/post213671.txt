How to delete shared contacts? <body> Someone shared their contacts with me and I don't know how to delete them. I've opened the contacts app but I don't see them. I only see them when I'm writing a new text message and they show up in the auto complete field.  Groups says   ul liAll iCloud/li liGroup name/li /ul  <comment257943> Open Contacts and click groups in the top left corner and see if that gives any clues. <comment257946> It has two groups. Both selected.
