With File Vault ON are time machine backups encrypted? <body> I have been using time machine to back up to a wireless external drive since I got my mac. Today I used filevault to encrypt my hard drive.  ul liWill this affect how Time Machine backs up my files?/li liWill the new backups be encrypted on the external drive?/li /ul  I am running Lion on the mac.   I found this on an apple support page - http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/21241.html  'If you must back up to a network or external disk that’s not under your control, you can turn on FileVault to encrypt data stored in your home directory. strongThis data will also be encrypted in the backup/strong. However, Time Machine will perform backups only when you are logged out of your user account.'  How can I check to see if the Time Machine backups are actually encrypted?  <answer46834> No, the backups will not be encrypted automatically, but it's very easy to enable for directly attached disks. Just check "Encrypt Backup Disk" in the Time Machine disk selection settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hc80.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you're backing up to another Mac, you can use Disk Utility on that Mac to erase non-boot drives and put an encrypted partition on them:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/asqw2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer46836> h1No./h1  Time Machine backups are strongnot encrypted by default/strong.

You can use a free tool such as the strongTimeMachineEditor/strong to perform backups at custom time intervals or calendar events.  <comment53581> Is this only possible for direct-attached disk? I have remote TM backups to another Mac happening and that option is greyed out, un-selectable. <comment53585> @IanC. That would be my guess. If you are backing up to another Mac, you can always encrypt the disk manually with Disk Utility <comment53787> Note that the Apple document you linked applies to version 10.6.  FileVault has been completely changed in 10.7, so its descriptions no longer apply.
