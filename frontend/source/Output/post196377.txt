MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013) not recoginizing keyboard and trackpad <body> My girlfriend has a 13-inch Mid 2013 MacBook Air, OS X 10.9.5. Yesterday, the keyboard and the trackpad stopped working. I connected a USB keyboard which works.  I believe it's a software problem because:  ul liThe Power key still works (all the time)/li liI can boot up in verbose mode (press Command + V while booting)/li liI can do an SMC reset (Shift + Control + Option + Power Up)/li liI can do a PRAM reset (Option + Command + P + R + Power Up)/li /ul  All these things seem to work with the built-in keyboard, but as soon as the login window appears, the keyboard does not work anymore (except the power button).  Are there any more things I could try? Thanks for your suggestions!  Edit: I just checked the system.log (why didn't I do that earlier?) and the log is FILLED (like 100 messages per second) with these entries:  precodekernel[0]: Error: AppleHSSPIController::InterruptOccurred Failed to transfer interrupt data with Err (0xe00002eb) kernel[0]: Error: AppleHSSPIController::doSPITransfer NAK received from device kernel[0]: Error: AppleHSSPIController::doSPITransfer CRC from device was invalid: computed 0xC03B, received 0x9F7D /code/pre  <answer270428> Since someone tried to contact me about this issue (he was having the same problem), I will answer my own question.  In the end I took the MacBook to an Apple Shop where they replaced a ribbon cable which solved the problem. Seems like it was a hardware problem after all.  <comment234565> Does it work in Safe Boot (boot while holding shift) <comment234567> It boots in safe mode (means it did recognize the shift press), but at the login window still nothing works except USB keyboard and mouse. <comment234569> The boot process starts with generic machine keyboard. After log in system attempts to use the user specified keyboard layout. Did you repair users permissions and disk permissions ? <comment234577> I just updated the whole system to Yosemite. Then I tried to repair the disk permissions using the disk utility and then I reset the user permissions using this method: http://osxdaily.com/2011/11/15/repair-user-permissions-in-mac-os-x-lion/  Sadly still no luck. Keyboard and trackpad not working. <comment234578> If you boot with no USB keyboard, does it show the screen where it suggests changing the batteries in your mouse and keyboard? <comment234579> Let me try that.  I just checked the system log and found something, I added that to my question. <comment234580> No, if i disconnect the USB keyboard and force-reboot (long power button press) the device it boots up completely normal (but, of course, without working keyboard/trackpad).
