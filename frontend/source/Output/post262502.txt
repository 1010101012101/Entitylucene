Is it possible to have iTunes 12 use the same image file for all tracks in an album? <body> When I "add artwork" to tracks in an album, iTunes appears to embed the image file in each track. I noticed the file size of each track increased accordingly. When you have high-resolution artwork, this seems like a waste.   Is it possible to have iTunes share references to the same image for all tracks in an album?
