Recording multiple midi inputs to separate tracks on garageband <body> Is there a way to record multiple midi inputs to separate tracks simultaneously using garageband?  I'm holding an interview tomorrow and want a microphone for the subject and myself. I need to separately edit the tracks.  <answer166922> Update: Found that the 'Show Record Enable' function had been disabled.  To enable it, right click on a track, Track Header Components  Show Record Enable.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrRzbLvsqc#t=36  You can then click the record button for each track you want to record simultaneously.  <comment195705> Midi inputs for a microphone? <comment199189> 2 USB microphones recording to separate tracks. <comment199262> Nothing to do with MIDI then ;) MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, which doesn't encompass audio at all.
