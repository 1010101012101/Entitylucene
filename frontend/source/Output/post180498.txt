Does the Buillt-in Apple Recovery Partition already have an OS X Image? <body> Does the Buillt-in Apple Recovery Partition already have an OS X Image or does it download it over internet? I am asking because if it does download over the internet I want to create my own recovery partition from a Yosemite Install application.  <answer180499> It has to download. In favor of saving space on your hard drive, the Recovery HD is 650 MB of various utilities including one to download and reinstall OS X.  <answer261962> It has to download.  You can make a bootable partition that installs macOS using the free Install Disk Creator.  Just follow the instructions there on how to use it, but point it at a blank partition of 8GB or larger.
