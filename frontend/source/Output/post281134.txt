USB 3 UASP & OS X Target Disk Mode <body> I have an old drive extracted from an iMac placed in an external drive case with USB 3 + UASP support. I know that OS X supports UASP, But does it work in target disk mode?  I'm wondering if running the old OS X install over USB 3 is possible or practical.  <comment353716> Have done with just normal USB 3 drives, from an iMac on a MacBook Pro.  Worked fine when booted. Drive bandwidth won't be the same as the internal SATA drive.
