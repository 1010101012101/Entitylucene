Making 2008 Macbook work with new SSD running Sierra <body> I had an old late 2008 Macbook lying around (fully functional, just slow) and a Samsung 840 EVO available (also working) so I removed the old hard drive I had in there and replaced it for the SSD. However, I simply get a prohibited symbol on start-up like the one shown below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TRlgym.png" alt="enter image description here"  To recap:  ol liI used Disk Utility to format the SSD drive using my new Macbook Pro and did Mac OS Extended (Journaled);/li liConnected the SSD to the new computer and restarted the computer, hitting Cmd + R to enter boot mode;/li liFrom there, I installed OS Sierra in the SSD drive. The computer then started running from the SSD, I created the user account, and all that. Eventually I was just at the classic Mac homescreen, everything working fine./li liSince everything worked fine, I then opened up my old Macbook, removed the old hard drive and connected the SSD instead./li liI closed everything and turned the computer on, leading me to the prohibited screen mentioned above./li /ol  The old hard drive was working fine and the opening and closing of the computer was straightforward and didn't have any issues so I believe the SATA cable inside the computer is working. I've googled this a lot but haven't managed to find any answers. Help would be much appreciated!  Finally, I thought maybe installing an older OS could work. Could this be a solution? Ideally, I'd want Sierra though.  <answer285368> strongSierra is not compatible with your 2008 MacBook/strongsup1/sup  Mac Supported Hardware:  ul liMacBook (Late 2009 or newer)/li liMacBook Pro (Mid 2010 or newer)/li liMacBook Air (Late 2010 or newer)/li liMac mini (Mid 2010 or newer)/li liiMac (Late 2009 or newer)/li liMac Pro (Mid 2010 or newer)/li /ul  As to why your machine is coming up as non-bootable is because your Mac cannot read the new Apple File System (APFS) which centers around security and encryption.sup2/sup  Basically, your Mac's firmware cannot read the drive to boot from it.  hr  sup1/sup MacOS Sierra - Technical Specifications  sup2/sup What MacOS Sierra's New APFS File System Means to You    <comment359836> Thanks for that! I will try installing El Capitan instead since it appears to be compatible. <comment359842> Let me know how things work out for you. <comment360188> The way I got it to work was by formatting the old hard drive I had in the old Macbook and then using Disk Utility to copy all the contents in it (the only thing I wanted was just a compatible OS - it was running 10.10) to the SSD. Then it worked and it's super fast now!
