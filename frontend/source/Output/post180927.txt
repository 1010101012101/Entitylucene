Key to boot from USB on Ubuntu Macbook 2007 <body> I recently installed Ubuntu 14.10 on my 2007 Macbook. I need OS X back. I burned OS X Lion (10.7) to a USB, now what?  <answer180943> First step is to discover if the OS on the USB stick is properly formatted and built for a boot device.  For this you will need a Mac running OS X. Insert the stick and go to codeSystem Preferences/code â†’ codeStartup Disk/code.

If it doesn't show up the most likely reason is a badly formatted stick. Your stick must use a GUID partition table and the boot partition must be formatted codeMac OS X Extended (Journalled)/code.  <comment215060> as for stick it in the USB port and let it do its work ? if not hold cmd+r to select the boot system.
