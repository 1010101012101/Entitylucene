Delete yosemite partition from dual boot with el capitan <body> I want to install El Capitan and dual boot it with my current installation of Yosemite. I know how to achieve that with 2 partitions.  I just wonder: if, later, I want to delete Yosemite, can I just delete its partition and resize the partition of El Capitan without trouble? Should I pay attention to something?  <comment261877> You can only expand the first partition. I'd download the Yosemite installer, install on 2nd partition, and upgrade your current system.
