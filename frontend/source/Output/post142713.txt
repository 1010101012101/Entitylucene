Add languages to OSX dictionary <body> The native OSX dictionary (hover + 3-finger-tap) does not work for the Hebrew language.  The example below shows its reluctance to interpret the word פרסומת, a valid Hebrew word.  Any ideas how to add extra languages to the dictionary?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mkcva.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer142716> Three-finger tap lookup is enabled by Dictionary.app.   codeDictionary -&gt; Preferences/code will enable you to activate more built-in dictionaries.   For more on adding dictionaries to Dictionary.app, check out this article which also points out how to download and install third-party dictionaries.   <answer142772> This site has a number of extra dictionaries:  http://clasquin-johnson.co.za/michel/mac-os-x-dictionaries/index.html  and this article provides links for Hebrew/English and English/Hebrew  http://blog.jle.vi/post/72464439746/get-the-look-up-dictionary-feature-in-os-x-to-work  <answer224668> I was fed up with how hard it is to find good dictionaries if you don't speak one of the "big" languages that Apple supports (El Capitan adds a few very good dictionaries for German etc., but that's not very helpful for users in small(er) countries) and so I decided to do something about it and made an app for installing translation dictionaries: Dictionaries.  Right now it has 44 languages (including Hebrew) and dictionaries are based on a good source (Wiktionary, periodically updated and growing steadily) and have stylesheets to look good in Yosemite and El Capitan. That's my two gripes with clasqm's huge collection that Tom mentions: those are mostly old dictionaries, not updated for 10.10+'s more modern look and they are one-off conversions.   <comment168108> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58823/how-to-switch-language-of-os-x-dictionary <comment168154> Great picture. I'll link this to the duplicate but feel free to ping me if this is somehow different than the linked question in the end. <comment168165> @bmike it is different, I want to add a language that isn't already there <comment168167> So Hebrew isn't covered in is post? http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58833/5472 You can add any new dictionaries to /Library/Dictionaries... It's not clear if you are looking for recommendations on how to locate a proper hebrew dictionary or just wanted to know that you could add languages if you don't like the ones Apple supplies. <comment168174> See if this page has a Hebrew dictionary to add:  http://clasquin-johnson.co.za/michel/mac-os-x-dictionaries/index.html <comment168175> @TomGewecke All clear for a real answer :-) Thanks! <comment276208> Works BUT contains quite limited dictionaries, and is a commercial product (*although very cheap, only a couple of dollars*) <comment276211> @oori Out of curiosity, what language(s) did you try? The quality varies depending how popular a language is at Wiktionary, some are pretty good, some… ehm, less so. <comment277334> hebrew 15k definitions
