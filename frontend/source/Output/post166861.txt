Is there a way to show import errors in iTunes? <body> When importing video files into iTunes (through either emFile  Add to Library/em, drag and drop, or the automatic import folder), is there a way to show errors or a log explaining why a file was not imported?  When using the automatic import folder, the rejected file is moved into the emNot Added/em folder, but iTunes doesn't give any reason why the file was rejected. Is there a way to enable logging in iTunes to show what went wrong (e.g. emwrong audio codec/em)?  <comment195638> not checked - but Console would be the most likely place to find it <comment195642> In my experience Automatic Import Folder does not work well at all. It often appear things in Not Added for no reason, and manually import them fixed it without issues. <comment195643> Nothing in Console when importing - no messages related to import when I filter for "itunes". <comment195644> Tried all ways of importing, same result in all cases, the file does not show up in iTunes, no message indicating why it was rejected.
