How often does Google Notifier check for email? <body> I just installed Google Notifier (Mac), and I noticed that it's a bit delayed in when it reports an email has arrived.  It seems that it polls the server every X minutes instead of using push technology. How often does Google Notifier check for mail, and is there any way to modify it?  <answer8380> I believe by default it checks every ten minutes.  To adjust the interval, click on the mail icon, then hold down the Command and Option keys and click on Preferences.br A box will pop up asking for a key and value. Use codeAutocheckInterval/code as the key and type the number of minutes in the value box.  Then click Set and you're done.  You need to restart it for the change to take effect.  NOTE: codeAutocheckInterval/code is case-sensitive  You can also do the following in Terminal    codedefaults write com.google.GmailNotifier AutocheckInterval #/code    Replace the code#/code above with a number to represent minutes between checks  <answer8406> In addition to @Griffo's suggestion of using codeAutocheckInterval/code, you can also undo this change by typing the following in terminal:  precodedefaults delete com.google.GmailNotifier AutocheckInterval /code/pre  <comment9026> You could also try Notify (http://notifyapp.com). It's a bit more powerful than Google's notifier. <comment9042> Yup, I added the Terminal command to set it too.
