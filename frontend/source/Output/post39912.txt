How to omit apps from external drives in "Open With" menu? <body> I maintain a SuperDuper! clone of my primary boot drive for backup purposes. When it's mounted, Finder's "Open With" menu shows duplicate applications. When I unmount it, they go away.  How do I configure OS X not to show applications from external drives in "Open With"?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Quubj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note: there is a related question involving duplicate "Open With" items. However, it's not related to external backup drives and its answer -- rebuilding the LaunchServices database -- does not solve my problem.  <answer39930> You can prevent the applications on your external drive from appearing in the Open With… menu by preventing Spotlight from indexing the drive.   To do this navigate to strongSystem Preferences  Spotlight/strong. Select the strongPrivacy/strong tab and add your external drive to the list. emMutineer in the screenshot below is my SuperDuper clone drive./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7h82K.png" alt="enter image description here"  Update: My best recollection is that this was all I did to solve the problem, but if the problem persists, two additional steps may be necessary:     strongMake Launch Services reload the list of available apps/strong with the command /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -all local,system,user. As apps on the second drive are not available via Spotlight anymore, the new database will only contain those on your main drive.      strongRestart Finder/strong to rebuild its Open With context menu (Option-right click on its Dock icon to get the restart option, or do killall Finder in Terminal).   emCredit to/em @kopischke for providing this concise answer on SuperUser.  If you want to avoid the terminal incantations, you can use Onyx to rebuild the spotlight index and launch services database.   <comment45146> Just eject it. And leave it unmounted. <comment45212> This does not work for me. Actually, I opened Spotlight preferences to find that my clone drive had *already* been added to this list. I guess I had tried this technique before at some point. <comment45270> In that case you may also need to [refresh the Spotlight index](http://superuser.com/q/348930) too. <comment45272> …and I've expanded my answer to include the additional steps. I don't recall doing this, but I originally faced the issue years ago and I most likely automatically applied the "shortcut solution" when I replaced my clone drive. Apologies. <comment67752> but then "find" (files and folders) feature won't work on that external drive :( <comment135981> Thanks for this! I have a Boot Camp partition, and kept getting Windows apps showing in the "Open With" menu. The partition kept disappearing from the privacy tab, so I added the WINDOWS folder and the Program Files folder instead - worked like a charm!
