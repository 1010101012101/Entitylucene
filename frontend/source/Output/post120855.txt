Mavericks + Server.app + getmail (oh my!) <body> I have a Mac mini Server with OS X Mavericks 10.9.1 and Server.app v3.0 installed. IMAP (dovecot) is running and accessible from Mail clients.  What I want is to have the server fetch emails from my various email accounts and "dump" them into the IMAP server.  I was previously able to do this on Linux by using getmail to fetch the emails, which would send the emails through codeprocmail/code, which would deliver them directly into the Maildir folder which codedovecot/code read.  Unfortunately the above process won't work with Server.app v3.0, as apparently the code/Library/Server/Mail/Data/mail/*/code directories emmust/em be owned by code_dovecot/code, which means Joe Random User can't write to them, which rules out procmail/etc.  Is there an easy(-ish) way to get a similar workflow, having the Server retrieve emails and add them to the local IMAP server?  What about server-side filtering? How can that be setup?  <answer120908>    Is there an easy(-ish) way to get a similar workflow, having the Server retrieve emails and add them to the local IMAP server?   The key is to use the codedovecot-lda/code program (emlda/em for Local Deliver Agent), which can write messages into the IMAP server.  For example, if using codegetmail/code, you could provide a code[destination]/code section which invokes codedovecot-lda/code:  precode[destination] type      = MDA_external path      = /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/libexec/dovecot/dovecot-lda  arguments = ("-d", "USERNAME") allow_root_commands = True /code/pre  Note that codeallow_root_commands/code is required because codegetmail/code will need to be run as root to invoke codedovecot-lda/code.  Aside: The path for codedovecot-lda/code is specified in the postfix configuration file code/Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/master.cf/code:  precodedovecot   unix  -       n       n       -       25      pipe   flags=DRhu user=_dovecot:mail argv=/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/libexec/dovecot/dovecot-lda -d ${user} /code/pre     What about server-side filtering? How can that be setup?   Dovecot is configured to use Sieve (code/Library/Server/Mail/Config/dovecot/conf.d/90-sieve.conf/code). Sieve rules are stored in code/Library/Server/Mail/Data/rules/%u/dovecot.sieve/code (see code/Library/Server/Mail/Config/dovecot/conf.d/90-sieve.conf/code), which unfortunately isn't easily writeable.  To install additional Sieve rules, use a Sieve editor, e.g. Sieve clients. Note that you need to use the correct port (Server.app defaults to port 4190; see code/Library/Server/Mail/Config/dovecot/conf.d/20-managesieve.conf/code).  Unfortunately, after spending far too much time trying to make this work, I've given up on using a Sieve client.  If you're root, create a code.sieve/code file (verify syntax with codesievec/code), then copy to code/Library/Server/Mail/Data/rules/%u/dovecot.sieve/code. Note: code%u/code is the user's GUID, not their user name (i.e. code/Library/Server/Mail/Data/mail/%u/code should exist), and code/Library/Server/Mail/Data/rules/%u/code should have permissions 775 (writable by the codemail/code user).  If you're not root...get root and see above.  When the Sieve rules are in place, code/Library/Logs/Mail/mail-info.log/code will contain a line similar to:  precodemail-info.log:Feb 13 17:14:52 lda(pid 6108 user USERNAME-NOT-GUID): Info: sieve: msgid=&lt;whatever...&gt;: ... /code/pre  <comment140897> Have you tried using ACLs to get around the restriction that directories must be owned by `_dovecot`?
