Spotlight "Indexing and searching disabled." message in terminal on OSX. Why? <body> My spotlight searching hasn't worked for quite some time and I've tried everything I could find on Google. I can't search for anything on my MacBook.. literally nothing shows up. I'll list the things I've tried and specs:  Early 2011 2.2Ghz MBP 4GB RAM OSX 10.9.4  ul lidisble/enable spotlight via terminal/li litoggled hidden files and looked for ".metadataneverindex" couldn't find it/li lirepeated the previous, using terminal commands.. file not found/li liput everything in the preferences/privacy "prevent indexing" then removed/li lisudo mdutil -i on /â€¨/li lisudo mdutil -E //li lisudo mdutil -a -i on/li lizapping the PRAM/li /ul  Based on what Trane Francks said in the comment below.. I built the DB and ran the line again. The second line is what it returned:     locate .metadata_never_index     /.metadata_never_index  I found .metadata_never_index as a hidden file in my root, so I deleted it and tried reindexing.. but its giving the "Indexing and searching are disabled" message still.  I've tried many of things and every time.. I get "indexing and searching disabled."  I just wanna be able to search my mac again!! Please help! Thanks.  <answer147150> Re-index an entire drive In the Terminal, type sudo mdutil -E / and hit return. You may have to enter your password. The existing Spotlight index will be deleted, and Spotlight will start creating a new index in the background. You can re-index other hard drives by changing the command to include their name, like sudo mdutil -E /Volumes/OtherHardDrive.  precodesudo mdutil -i off / sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight* sudo mdutil -i on / sudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  I'm order, these accomplish:  ol liturn indexing off/li lidelete Spotlight folder/li liturn indexing on/li lirebuild/li /ol  <answer147841> FINALLY!! I got it working again!  Heres what I did:  In terminal I ran:  precodelocate .metadata_never_index /code/pre  No database existed, so it prompted me to run:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist /code/pre  It ran for a few seconds and I retried the locate command.. it found it in my root. I deleted it and tried turning on spotlight again, but still got the "indexing and searching disabled."  I checked the permissions of my SSD and my account wasn't even listed. I added myself to read/write. Then ran:  precodesudo mdutil -i on / /code/pre  terminal returned "Indexing enabled."  Lastly.. I went to system preferencesspotlightprivacy.. dragged my SSD then removed it to reindex. 40 minutes later.. everything is back to normal! It had been a year since spotlight worked on my MBP. Ohhh the struggles I faced trying to find emails/files.  Thanks for the tips and suggestions everyone and Google!  <answer258808> I search for it in the net for months... and it was so easy!!  System preferences -spotilight -Privacy -if your harddisk is in the list mark it and then press (-)   When your harddisk is removed from "prevent searching this locations",  you spotilight will scan your files for around 2 hours and voila!  :)  <comment172694> Just to confirm, the filename is actually '.metadata_never_index'. When I run 'locate .metadata_never_index' in Terminal, it finds the file in my recovery partition. <comment174299> It gives the "indexing and searching disabled." message when I try that <comment174300> I tried that and terminal returns: "WARNING: The locate database (/var/db/locate.database) does not exist. To create the database, run the following command:    sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist" <comment174303> @TraneFrancks I updated my question after I updated the database and tried it again. Can I do "rm /.metadata_never_index" to delete it? <comment174312> If you want to delete a system file, you'll need to use `sudo`, e.g., `sudo rm /.metadata_never_index`. <comment282279> I wonder if this is much different than http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24401/spotlight-reports-indexing-and-searching-disabled-in-lion
