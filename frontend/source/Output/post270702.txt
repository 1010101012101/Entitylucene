How to get corrupted data from Imessage BACK on phone? <body> Yesterday, my phone randomly deleted my photos when using a program to try to get my deleted messages back. But luckily, the next day I woke up to having all my photos back on my phone. However, I noticed the night befote that although I had 0 photos on my phone, it said I had 21 gb of photos on my phone, and that's how I think I got them back. I have no messages, but my settings say I have 8 gb of messages. How do I get these messages back, since clearly the messages are somewhere just like the photos were? Thanks in advance. (P.S. before you ask, I do not have a recent backup on icloud with all the messages, but there has to be some way to get them back like the photos)
