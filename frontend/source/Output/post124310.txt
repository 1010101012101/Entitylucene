Is there a way to automatically upload photos from an iPhone to Google Drive <body> With Dropbox, you have the option to upload all photos from your iPhone to Dropbox. Is there an equivalent for Google Drive? I.e. is there an app, that when I open it will upload all my photos from my iPhone to my Google Drive account?  I don't see a preference setting for this in the google drive app, and I have searched for 3rd party apps and nothing seems to do this.  <answer125179> You should use the app strongPhotosync/strong which let you choose where to download your pictures, including Dropbox, Google+/Picasa, Box, 500Px and Google Drive (!) to answer your question.  <answer154300> Use Google+! Switch on auto back up, check settings to make sure it uploads over wifi only perhaps.  Also, the Google+ app offers the option to upload full-size photo files, which will use your Google Drive space allotment, or to upload unlimited "standard-sized" photo files. Standard size means they are resized to 2048 on the longest edge. This is a nice option if your photos are mostly snapshots or mostly just viewed on screen and never printed.  <answer178405> I was looking for this 'automatic uploader' too.  I downloaded the IFTTT app and added a recipe that checks if any new item is added to the camera row and, if so, store to google drive.  <answer277157> It sounds like you're looking for the Google Photos app.  <answer277167> strongYes, Google Drive has a built-in option for automatic photo backups./strong  Go to Settings - Photos and enable Auto-Backup. If you choose to upload in High Quality instead of Original, the uploaded photos won't count against your Google Drive storage limit.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkKtmm.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZzLeqm.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWE6bm.png" alt=""  <comment145370> Are you asking if the dropbox app integrates with google drive or looking for a recommendation for software that does? Please edit your tags and elaborate a bit if possible. <comment145371> To improve this question you might want to talk about what you have found out already, e.g. "I don't see a preference setting for this" and "I have searched for 3rd party apps and nothing seems to do this" <comment145375> e.g. means "for example" not "copy and paste" ;) <comment145414> @dwightk I don't follow what is wrong with my question now. If you know of an answer, please feel free to answer it rather than attack the question <comment145415> I'm not sure what the answer is. I'm trying to help you make the question more likely to be answered. (I'm not one of the downvotes) <comment223314> Awesome app, thanks for pointing it out. Tried another free app to do that, forget about it: photosync provides so much more settings to upload your pics properly (target folder, format, & so on), and can also plug to so many services (googleDrive, Dropbox, flickr, 500px, SmugMug, & so on). I say buy it, it's well worth $3 <comment348851> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.  Ideally, you want to explain why your answer is *right."
