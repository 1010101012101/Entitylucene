How can I convert an m4a to mov? <body> I have a m4a audio file that I need to convert to a mov file. How can I do this?  <answer107728> Open the .m4a in QuickTime and export it as a .mov file.  <answer107769> You could use iMovie to create a movie just showing a black screen and using the audio file as the audio track.  <answer107786> This creates an x264-encoded mov file with image.png as the background:  codeffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.png -i audio.m4a -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p -shortest output.mov/code  You can use mp4 or mkv as the container by just changing the name of the output file.  code-c:a copy/code disables re-encoding the audio.  code-loop 1/code loops the image infinitely so that it is not shown for just one frame. It also makes the video stream infinitely long, so code-shortest/code is needed to finish encoding after the audio stream finishes. code-shortest/code has to be after the input files in new versions of ffmpeg.  code-crf/code (constant rate factor) can be from 0 (lossless) to 51 (lowest quality). If you remove code-pix_fmt yuv420p/code, ffmpeg uses yuv444p, which is not supported by many video players.  You can use a black background by replacing code-loop 1 -i image.png/code with code-f lavfi -i color=c=black:s=1280x720/code. You can resize an image by adding an option like code-filter:v '[in] scale=-1:720, pad=1280:720:640-iw/2 [out]'/code.

The Format menu only provides the option "Audio Only". I want an actual movie...I suppose the video portion would be just a black image. <comment126346> Exactly what I said. I have a m4a file that I want to make into a video file. Is there a tool that makes this easy? I suppose the video portion would be just a black image, but if the tool allows me to select what image is displayed while the audio plays, that would be better. <comment126365> Just out of curiosity: Why would you want to do that? <comment126370> Good idea. Any good set of instructions for how to do that? <comment199458> I'm doing it to upload my podcast audio file to YouTube to take advantage of auto-captioning for a deaf colleague who wants to subscribe.
