Disk space used by iPhoto/iMovie libraries on OS X <body> How can I tell how much space my iphotos and imovies are taking on my Macbook Pro hard drive? I've checked the applications from my finder, but iphoto and imovie are not listed there.  <answer108264> ul liiPhoto pictures are stored in code~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/code/li liiMovie movies are stored in code~/Movies/iMovie Events/code (iMovie 9) or code~/Movies/iMovie Library/code (iMovie 10, name may be different as my system runs on German settings)/li /ul  Select the library and type kbdCmd/kbd+kbdI/kbd to open the "Get Info" window which also shows file size (may take a while to calculate).
