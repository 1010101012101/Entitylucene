In Terminal, where it displays XXX@YYY , what is XXX and what is YYY? <body> I transferred a backup to a new mac.  However the names got changed, and one has a code-2/code added to it. Now my terminal reads codename@name-2 -$/code.   In Finder it appears like so:   precode`name (2)`   `HardDriveName`     `Users`        `name` /code/pre  Trying to identify what codename (2)/code is and how I can change it if possible.   Was never prompted in the migration and not sure why the code-2/code is appended in the terminal now.  <answer126369> codename (2)/code is your computer's hostname. You can change it in the 'Sharing' section of System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UgaHk.png" alt="Sharing.prefPane"  <comment147991> My guess is that the two computer were at one point both running on the same network. When this happens, one computer changes its hostname to “Name (2)” to avoid confusion and, possibly, conflicts.
