How to run a Visual Studio on Parallels Desktop with Elevated privilages via dock icon <body> I have a OS X Mavericks with Parallels Desktop 9 hosting Windows 8.1 on it. Windows has Visual Studio 2013 installed.   I am working in Coherence mode. If I run Visual Studio from Start menu or some other way, it appears in OS X dock. I can choose to Keep it in dock.  But I need VS to start with Elevated (admin) privileges. The devenv.exe, which is a Visual Studio executable, doesn't have a Compatibility tab where I could check the Always run in Admin mode, which would solve my problem.  How can I have Visual Studio in dock and have it being executed with Admin right?  Thanks.  <answer139062> Try to launch devenv through runas.exe, there you can specify the user who you want.  So you should make a shortcut with the following command:  precoderunas.exe /user:admin "c:\PATHTODEVENV\devenv.exe /code/pre  As I know it will ask your password, but then you can try the /savecred switch.
