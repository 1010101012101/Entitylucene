Failed to update brew <body> I'm trying to update brew but I get this error message:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gxRf4.png" alt="enter image description here"  The directory /Library/Formula doesn't even exist. What should I do?  <answer187807> They probably speak about code/usr/local/Library/Formula//code. Try this:  precode$ cd /usr/local/Library/Formula/ $ git checkout curlpp.rb /code/pre  Last but not least check the general Homebrew status:  precode$ brew doctor /code/pre  <answer187838> Be aware of what messages said.      Please move or remove them before you can merge.   So, let's move it.  precodemv /usr/local/Library/Formula/curlpp.rb /usr/local/Library/Formula/curlpp.rb.old /code/pre  Then try again:  precodebrew upgrade /code/pre  <comment222108> When I type the command "git checkout curlpp.rb" it says: "error: pathspec 'curlpp.rb' did not match any file(s) known to git." <comment222114> Did you make sure you've changed into the parent directory before? (`cd /usr/local/Library/Formula/`)
