Weird problems with Safari: search bar and tabs <body> Suddenly Safari is having weird problems:  ul liThe search bar is no more emsearching/em: I can type URLs but the suggestions are not appearing and queries are not sent to Google (or any other search engine I choose in the preferences)/li liIf I open a new tab, the tab is not shown: I see the old one in dark grey, the new one is open but not shown in the tab bar. The address bar shows the URLs of both tabs superimposed/li /ul  Restarting the whole machine did not bring anything.  Any idea what could I try to fix the problem? I am using Safari 9.0.3 on El Capitan.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEYi4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer225160> I had exactly the same (but on Yosemite), and found this (https://discussions.apple.com/message/29693684#29693684) resolved it.  Uncheck codeUse Safari Suggestions/code in the codeSearch/code tab in Safari Preferences.  Certainly not a solution to the problem, but gets around it until more concrete information comes out..  <answer225162> I had the same issue since this morning, I guess it could be something "malfunctioned" or badly processed data arriving from Google suggestions:  Got rid of it by going to: Safari - Preferences - Search  Here everything was ticked, I unticked all, then reticked "Include search engine suggestions" only, the problem stopped.  Edit: Safari suggestions was the problem, not google, sorry, ticking back everything else and it works, ticking back Safari suggestions and it dies.  <comment273201> Thank you very much, this workaround worked for me! <comment273215> Maybe related to Apple but not Google. I have the same behaviour even if I choose another search engine (e.g., Yahoo or Bing) <comment273233> There seems to be a bug reported in many places today e.g. http://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/27/safari-crashing-how-to-fix/ - so I think should be a new question as different issue also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/225176/cannot-select-text-in-safari-address-bar <comment273298> Booh bad apple! :( http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html
