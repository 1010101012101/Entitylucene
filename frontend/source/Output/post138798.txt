How to determine what is intercepting mailto: links and disable the interception to have the default Apple Mail handle the mailto: links <body> At some point way back in the past, I set up some utility to intercept mailto: links in web pages and have Chrome compose a message in Gmail rather than having it open the Apple Mail app.  Now, I'm trying to remove it and have Apple Mail open mailto: links, but I can't figure out the utility I used to intercept them.  I thought it might have been Webmailer, but I checked System Preferences, and it's not in there. Also, I looked in my Chrome and Safari extensions, and no extensions that are currently installed have anything to do with redirecting mailto: links. Though it may have been a browser extension I installed and later removed.  I'm on Mac OS 10.7.5  <answer138809> Copy and paste codechrome://settings/handlers/code into the address bar in Chrome and check for an active protocol handler for Gmail.  If you don't find something there, you could try installing RCDefaultApp which should list any system wide protocol handlers.  <comment163767> Thanks. The Chrome approach didn't do it for me. I copied `chrome://settings/handlers` into Chrome. I found an active protocol handler that read "type" = "mailto"; "site" = "Gmail". I removed it, and it no longer shows up there. Quit Chrome and restarted it a couple of times, restarted Mac OS, and still when I clicked a "mailto:" link, it opened Chrome.   However, [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/) worked like a charm.
