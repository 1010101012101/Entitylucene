Is there a way to reduce the opening tab of safari <body> When opening a new tab or window in Safari, sometimes the address field is selected, and sometimes it isn't. If it's not, there's no way to tab to it. Is there a way to make the bar always selected by default?  <answer25350> There is no setting to do this but if you press kbdCommand/kbd+kbdL/kbd the cursor will move to the address bar.  <comment28656> or cmf shift F to go to the search bar <comment28765> In Safari 5 the shortcut for the search bar is actually Command+Option+F <comment164884> same problem on yosemite OS X 10.10 also
