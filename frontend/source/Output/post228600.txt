I have only 1 option: use speakers How to use build-in sound to record sound from my mac ? Also in audacity I have not "Soundflower" option ...  <answer231661> Try looking into your Adobe applications. I had the same issue, couldn't get rid of soundflower, and started thinking of what apps I had that dealt with audio. I remembered I had Adobe Audition, and uninstalled it. It worked! No more soundflower!    Hoppe this helps  <answer237071> Tracking down the correct forks of this semi-dead project was indeed tricky.  I installed the Kernel Extension from here: https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases  I installed SoundFlowerBed from this fork: https://github.com/mLupine/SoundflowerBed/releases  That puts an item in the menu that allows you to set codeSoundFlower (2ch)/code -- codeBuilt-In Output/code, which then makes "SoundFlower" available in QuickTime Player etc.  <comment278744> Welcome to Ask Different. What version of OS X? What version of sound flower? <comment278802> You'll need to have Soundflower downloaded and running to use it. Have you made sure that's happening? If so, can you give us screenshots so we can better understand what's happening?
