Launchd unloading LaunchDaemon <body> I have a script scheduled to run as LaunchDaemon. Script runs fine when launched manually through terminal.   I have two commands  precodesudo launchctl unload -F /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.test.plist sudo launchctl load -F /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.test.plist /code/pre  plist below  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com    /DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;  &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;  &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;com.test.plist&lt;/string&gt;  &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;  &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/test.sh&lt;/string&gt;  &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt;  &lt;string&gt;/tmp/com.test.plist.err&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;/tmp/com.test.plist.out&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;18&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;4&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre     when run separately they do work. But once scheduled in launchd it runs for split second them goes to unloaded. I am guessing once it unloads the script it stops running. I change the values of the intervals set in the plist with another script which is why I need to unload and load. Is there another way to do this?  <answer153279> Is the problem perhaps that your codeunload/code command hasn't finished before the codeload/code command starts?  How about trying kickstart instead? "-k" instructs launchctl to "kill the running instance before restarting the service."     sudo launchctl kickstart -k /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.test.plist   Note that codeload/code and codeunload/code are now under "Legacy commands" in the Yosemite launchctl man page.  <answer154021> Thanks Alastair, good to know for the future but presently I am only running Mavericks.  My solution was to put the load commands into the first script (which isnt executed by launchd). I think the issue was caused trying to unload and load while launchd was already running the script.  Thanks for the suggestions   <comment180386> What does the plist look like - we need to know what options you have chosen <comment180387> Updated original post with plist, Thanks <comment180388> Well that should just run the script and from what you say it does - what does the output text file show - what does the script do/ Also what do you mean ny unload - here the plist runs your script <comment180390> It doesnt write anything to the plist.out file. I get some 'launchd assertion failed' error messages in the console but other than that nothing. The script does an initial backup and unloads / loads the new schedule time which is updated using another script that runs first and uses plistbuddy to make the changes.
