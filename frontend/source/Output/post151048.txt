Lost ability to choose 3440x1440 resolution after Yosemite upgrade <body> I have an LG 34UM95 connected via TB on a Late 2012 mac mini.  After the Yosemite install, I no longer have the option of choosing 3440x1440 resolution in the Displays preferences.  It worked just fine prior to the upgrade.  I did do the Option-Scaled bit to see the extended list of  choices, but nothing higher than 2560x1080 shows up.  Can I get my 3440x1440 resolution back?  EDIT: my colorsync profile...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KERmT.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongEDIT 2/strong I just upgraded from 10.10 to 10.10.2.  Resolution stayed the same! Woot!!  So, either the new update fixed the issue, or it  didn't touch the graphics extension.  <answer151226> There seems to be a solute - see:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6240037?tstart=0  <answer151279> I was successful in getting the 3440x1440 resolution back in Yosemite by following the instructions from a discussion on Apple's discussion page.  The thread is a good read, to put the instructions in context, but the gist is as such...  ul liDisable the kext signature check codesudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1/code/li liPull in the codeAppleIntelFramebufferCapri.kext/code from TimeMachine prior to the Yosemite upgrade/li liMake the small edit as described in the thread above (not going to copy/paste his post verbatim here)/li liReboot/li /ul  Success!!  I had the 3440x1440 resolution in my Display preferences right away.  Didn't even have to hold down kbdOption/kbd to see it.  hr  Broken again after 10.10.1 update...  Looking to see if the same fix can still work...  <answer162688> Just press the option key while you select "Scaled" and will appear all the compatible resolutions.  <answer169610> A bit of a late answer, but this issue is now fixed in Yosemite 10.10.2 - full 3440x1400 (on a macbook air you have to close the lid of your laptop, but it works without hacks!)  <comment177956> That may not work in Yosemite, as Apple seems to no longer allow unsigned or modified kexts <comment177974> I saw that.  Checking into it.  I also started a thread similar to this over there.  There may be some progress there too... https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6600759?start=15&tstart=0 <comment177981> Let's just hope this isn't broken the instant there's a software update ;) <comment178263> @JoshP thanks for the kext, saved me digging about in time machine :D <comment184560> crud... c'est la vie <comment190241> the OP's question already said that doesn't work. <comment199278> I hope you're right.  I'd been avoiding updates.  I'll check it out. I'm running it on a MacMini though, not a macbook. We'll see ;) <comment199512> I just upgraded from 10.10 to 10.10.2.  Resolution stayed the same!
