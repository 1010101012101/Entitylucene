How to resize an image in Keynote or Pages? <body> If I resize the width of an image in Keynote or Pages the height resizes as well. The same thing happens vice versa.  How can I resize the width without affecting the height and vice versa?  <answer193311> Select the picture, then in the Arrange tab uncheck Constrain Proportions [you may have to revert to original size before that will un-grey.  Then dragging the image by any edge will stretch.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TCtRh.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you need to crop, that's in Image - Edit Mask [though crop doesn't constrain anyway]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UJPlD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment230325> You mean cropping or stretching? <comment230334> Stretching should be forbidden ;)
