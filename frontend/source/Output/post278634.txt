Touch Bar no longer controls iTunes <body> I installed the Google Play Music app on my Macbook (Sierra 10.12.4) then uninstalled it. Now my Touch Bar music controls no longer work with iTunes. How can I reset it?  <answer283400> The first thing I would do is reset your NVRAM.  strongResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. /li liKeep these keys pressed down for strongat least 20 seconds!/strong/li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  If resetting the NVRAM doesn't resolve it, try resetting your SMC as well.   strongResetting the SMC/strong  ol liShut down your Mac/li liUnplug the power cable from your Mac/li liFor 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the kbdshift/kbdkbdcontrol/kbdkbdoption/kbd keys (on the strongleft/strong side of the strongbuilt-in/strong keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liAfter 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button /li liPlug in the power cable/li liTurn your Mac back on with the power button./li /ol  Let me know how you go, as there are other things you can try. However, I've found that resetting the NVRAM and also the SMC will usually resolve emunusual/em or emrandom/em issues pertaining to the Touch Bar.  strong--[EDIT]--/strong  This edit adds further things to try in order to resolve this issue. However, since macOS 10.12.5 has just been released, I would update the OS prior to trying the following solutions.  strongUse Terminal to kill the Control Strip/strong  This is a straightforward way to manually reset the Control Strip. To do this:  ol liLaunch the Terminal app (by default located within the Utilities folder)/li liEnter the following command codekillall ControlStrip/code (or you can just copy and paste it in)/li liPress kbdreturn/kbd/li /ol  There is no need to restart the Mac after doing this.  strongChange what the Touch Bar shows/strong  In System Preferences you can change what the Touch Bar shows. I would change this, exit System Preferences, and then change it again (if necessary).  To do this:  ol liGot to Apple  System Preferences/li liClick on the Keyboard preference pane/li liEnsure the Keyboard tab is selected/li liAround the centre of the screen you'll see a Touch Bar shows drop-down list/li liChange the selection to Expanded Control Strip (if this is already selected, change it to App Controls with Control Strip)/li liExit System Preferences/li liTest your Touch Bar music controls/li liIf it doesn't work, repeat steps 1 to 5 and change the Touch Bar shows drop-down list selection back to the original selection and test again/li /ol  strongTroubleshooting steps/strong  If all else fails, you can try these troubleshooting steps:  ul listrongFunction keys -/strong Press the kbdfn/kbd key and try using the kbdF7/kbd, kbdF8/kbd, and kbdF9/kbd keys respectively as your media control keys and see what happens./li listrongUse another user account -/strong Try using another user account temporarily to determine if the problem persists. If you don't have another user account, you can add one in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups. Once you've added it, log into it and see how your media controls work./li listrongSafe Mode -/strong Boot your MBP up in Safe Mode and try using the media controls keys. To do this, hold the kbdshift/kbd key down as you boot up. This will take a little longer to boot as your Mac cleans caches, runs some diagnostics, etc. Once you've tested, exit Safe Mode by restarting your MBP and then test your media control keys again./li /ul  Once you've tried these troubleshooting steps, report back on what you found.  <answer283509> Because you say that the rest of the bar works even in iTunes, I really think this is probably an iTunes issue. I would try &amp; reinstall.  Try to throw iTunes in the trash - if it doesn't let you (it probably won't) you'll have to change the permissions. Right click &amp; select Get Info. Set everyone to 'read &amp; write' under permissions &amp; it away again, then go to the App Store and go to Software Update to install it again.  <comment350667> Basic question but have you rebooted to see if that helps? <comment350946> Yes I did, and that didn't fix it. <comment357209> The controls in the iTunes portion of the Bar work fine when iTunes is running. It is only the generic music controls (rewind,play/pause,ff) that don't work. <comment357666> I'm just wondering if you're still having this problem? Usually resetting the NVRAM and SMC solves _most_ random issues with the Touch Bar, but if this hasn't helped there are other suggestions I can add to my answer. Also, did you try reinstalling iTunes as suggested by fuccboi? <comment357701> Tried both, detected no changes to my system whatsoever, and the problem remains. <comment357703> Changed perms, uninstalled, but Software Update detected no changes to my system. Had to manually download the latest MacOS Sierra, reinstalling. <comment357715> Reinstalling the MacOS Sierra update after uninstalling iTunes also did not resolve the problem. <comment357778> There is definitely an app conflict going on, I have no idea how Google Play's music app could have caused this. Can I have you test this issue on a new user account? You can make one in Users & Groups over in System Preferences. Make sure it's an administrator - no iCloud necessary. Test it out there - if it functions ok, test it out using your exact library. You can share it with your test account using [these instructions here](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25262?locale=en_US) <comment357985> Since macOS Sierra 10.12.5 is now available, I recommend you update the OS and reporting back on whether that has any impact on this issue. If not I'll add some other suggestions. Good luck! <comment358178> I've updated my answer with some additional suggestions for you to try. However, if you haven't already done so, I recommend updating to macOS Sierra 10.12.5 first. <comment358330> Installed the macOS Sierra 10.12.5 patch, and the problem remains. <comment358388> Just a couple of things: (1) Earlier you commented _The controls in the iTunes portion of the Bar work fine when iTunes is running. It is only the generic music controls (rewind,play/pause,ff) that don't work_, can you clarify this for me? Are you saying the generic controls work when iTunes is running but not otherwise, or that the generic controls don't work at all? I'm now second-guessing whether I originally interpreted this correctly. (2) Have you had a chance to try everything in my answer so far? <comment358930> Hey my guy, ever get a chance to test this out?
