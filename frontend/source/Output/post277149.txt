DNS servers aren't specific to network? <body> On my Mac, I am trying to set my DNS servers so that they are code8.8.8.8/code and code8.8.4.4/code at my house, while at school they are the router default (they block google's public DNS)  How can I set up my DNS servers to be configured differently for each wireless network?  note: router configuration at my home is not an option.  I am running:br macOS 10.12.3 16D32 Sierra  brMacBook Pro 13" w/ 4 Thunderbolt 3  <answer277160>    How can I set up my DNS servers to be configured differently for each wireless network?   h3Set and Change in Network Preferences/h3  You can set your own custom DNS settings on a location basis by defining a "Location" in Network Preferences  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jCQC.png" alt="enter image description here"  You would then enter your preferred DNS settings (click "Advanced") under the DNS tab:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fkonf.png" alt="enter image description here"  After you create set the configuration to your liking, you can call it up by returning to this preferences page and just selecting the location of your choice.  Or...  You can switch from the directly from Apple Menu (ï£¿).  Just choose "Location" and select the location you want  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6Xdr.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3Switch using command Line/h3  For a quicker way, you can switch using the command codenetworksetup/code.  So, to switch to a profile you have already created called "School" your command would be:  precodenetworksetup -switchlocation School /code/pre  h3Bonus footage.../h3  You could create small bash scripts with the command pre populated and placed (or linked) on your desktop.  precode#!/bin/bash #Script to set the location to School  networksetup -switchlocation School exit /code/pre  Name it something meaningful like codeschool.sh/code or codeschool.command/code (or even just codeschool/code).  Make it executable by issuing the command codechmod +x /path/to/school.command/code (or whatever you called it).  Make another for Home, Work, In-Laws, or wherever.  When you double click on it, it will change the network location and your preset settings.  h3Caveat/h3  If your organization (like your school) blocks outside DNS servers and traffic limiting it to the DNS servers they specify, you won't be able to override them.  <comment348902> Great, thanks! I actually was using this because I discovered Google DNS is blocked by the school, and I need to use Google DNS at home without router config. Works like a charm!
