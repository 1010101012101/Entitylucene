Can you use an iPhone 5 to call if you have internet service, but no cell service? <body> I have an iPhone 5.  The place I'm moving to has a wi-fi network in place, but there's no cell service (it's in the mountains).  Is there any way to use my iPhone to make/receive calls over the wi-fi network?  I'd like it very much if people can still call me while I'm at home.  <answer122918> Nope, it won't work (directly) and not like you would like it.  If you want to call someone over wifi you need to use a VoIP service/use the SIP protocol.  The only possibility if you want someone to call you on your actual mobile number you need to get a femtocell to extend (very) localy the cellular network.   <answer122931> Notwithstanding the previous answers, someone has already mentioned a VoIP service.  To add more details, you can register with a VoIP hosting company, who will provide you with a login to their service.  With software like Zopier[1] you can make outbound calls from your phone.  You won't be able to receive inbound calls unless you actually register a number (which will cost for 'line rental') with a VoIP service, and set up call forwarding when you do have cellular signal from your mobile number to that VoIP number.  Regrettably, without a Femtocell there's no alternative to this for text messaging except for iMessage, so unless all of your contacts are on iOS you don't have a choice here.  [1] there are others - some more here: http://appadvice.com/appguides/show/voip-apps-for-ios  <answer122935> Assuming the WiFi connection has enough bandwidth for audio, you could install Skype and use SkypeIn/SkypeOut to be reachable via a phone number.  <answer122948> Another one to have a look is WhatsApp or Viber. Both these apps allow you to make calls to other uses who have them installed. These use Data rather than a cellular network. the only problem is the person you are calling will need to have these installed.  Just another option for you rather than having to setup skype account.  <answer214233> Facebook messenger for calls. Theres a icon of a phone beside the name of the contact when u open message window. Its crystal clear sound. Just turn on mic in settings.   <comment143481> Can you elaborate on this?  It sounds like you're saying there is a way, but that you have to do...something different. <comment143484> Skype or FaceTime (audio) unless you get a mobile cell spot from a provider that you can put into the WiFi network and then get the cellular network at home. <comment143487> TLDR : You won't be able to do what you want without a Femtocell. <comment143524> And as an addtion: It is possible to create a phone number in skype (https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA331/what-is-a-skype-number). So you could just redirect your calls from your cell phone to your skype number if your cell phone has no service. <comment143859> Can you confirm that these work when there is no cell service and the app isn't running to alert that an incoming call is in progress? <comment250916> seems to be a new feature in iOS 9 that will work with iPhone 5c and later https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203032
