How did a photo magically appear in the iphone contacts? <body> I am not wise to the ways of apple.  I've had an iphone for about 6 months, and this is the first time I noticed this occurring.   I created a new contact by directly entering it into  the Contacts app on the phone.  A little while later, I saw that this new contact has a photo attached to it.   I did not specify that photo. It appears to be the correct photo.   Where did it come from?   hr  I have the phone configured to sync with a GMail Contacts list, from work.  Is that where it comes from?   If someone else entered my name into their contacts list, would they get my picture?  How would I set it up so that they do?   thanks.  <answer65210> Did you enable iOS 6's Facebook Integration? It will grab updated contact information and pictures from anyone in your contacts you have on Facebook if you enable the Contacts syncing.  <answer78918> Your initial guess that it's Google Contacts is right - if you've set it up to sync with Google Contacts, it'll pull down the same contact photos as you have in Google Contacts, and it works both ways (assign a photo on iPhone, syncs back up to Google Contacts).  If you've got a contact photo set in Google+ or the like, it'll pull that photo automatically, so that's the photo which'll appear to others.  <comment76890> nope - it's IOS 4 ! <comment91245> The same is true for Exchange integration. Contact images put into the Outlook local contact list show up on the phone.
