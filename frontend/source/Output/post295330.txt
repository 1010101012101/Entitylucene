Show desktop content of each window by default? <body> Can anyone where can I find the Settings to show the desktop content of each window by default (without I need to hover my pointer to attached image)?  Previously I was able to see desktop content of each window but after some crashes on my Mac which led to restart, it becomes like this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgaxL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment372880> Hi Rendy, could you [edit](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/295330/edit) your question to clarify what you're asking? I *think* you may be talking about Mission Control, but that's not clear. Also, I see you're running El Capitan (because of the tag you've selected), but were you running El Capitan previously when this did work the way you want, or did you do a fresh installation and upgrade to El Capitan as part of that process?
