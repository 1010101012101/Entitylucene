Xcode 4: key binding for "Focus code blocks on hover" <body> Xcode 4 has a codeFocus code blocks on hover/code setting in Preferences  Text Editing. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eWWhr.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you hover the mouse on a codeCode folding ribbon/code, the mentioned setting has the effect shown in image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rJio5.png" alt="enter image description here" Also, the effect stays put when you navigate with the keyboard (even when you move focus to codeAssistant editor/code, codeNavigator/code, codeUtilities/code, ... but not to, say, codeOrganizer/code or codeVersion editor/code).  strongHow could you add a key binding for this?/strong  <answer81864> ul liGo to strongSettings  Keybindings/strong and search for emfocus/em./li liThen set your desired keybinding under strongCode Folding  Focus Follows Selection/strong./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpXvA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment94424> Was this added in Xcode 4.6? I could've sworn I already searched with "focus". :) Nevertheless, this is great. Thank you Bryan! <comment94425> I'm not sure when this was added. This also works on Xcode 4.5.2, which is the oldest version that I have installed for my computers. <comment94511> Now I remember: the menu entry was there in Xcode 4 from the get-go, but was [oddly disabled](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5926576/xcode-4-0-2-4a2002a-editor-code-folding-focus-follows-selection-grey-disa). <comment135643> OMG I just discovered this feature... super useful!
