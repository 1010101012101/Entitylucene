Safari doesn't remember tabs in Mountain Lion <body> In Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Safari preserved the state of my tabs when it closed. This functionality seems to have disappeared in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Is there a way to restore (no pun intended) this feature from with the System Preferences or perhaps a Terminal trick?  <answer57686> h2Undo quitting of all applications/h2  Apple has slightly changed the wording but the location for this setting is still the same as in Lion:  emSystem Preferences &#x2192; General &#x2192; Close windows when quitting an application/em  h2Undo quitting for a specific application/h2  This works only with emClose windows when quitting an application/em disabled at the same time.  Type the following command in the Terminal. Then restart the specific application.  In general the syntax is:  precodedefaults write com."producer"."program-name" ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES /code/pre  Thus, in your case (Safari.app) it is:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES /code/pre  You can undo this by using the parameter codeNO/code instead.  If you prefer a graphical interface, you can use strongTinkerTool/strong. But the current version 4.9 only supports the toggling on a per app basis in Lion. I'll update this answer when TinkerTool adds this feature for Mountain Lion as well.  <answer60056> If you already have the "Close windows when quitting an application" setting disabled, but certain apps don't restore their windows (while most other apps do), this fix worked for me:  ol liOpen System Preferences - General, and emcheck/em the "Close windows…" setting./li liClose System Preferences/li liReopen System Preferences - General, emuncheck/em the same setting, and close it again./li /ol  The setting should now be applied uniformly across all apps. At the very least, this fixed the issue where Safari would not restore its windows (even though other apps were doing so). (In my case, back in Lion I disabled window restoring on a few specific apps with the hidden setting via Terminal; Safari may have been one of them.)  <answer141596> You also need to check the codeNSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows/code setting:  precodedefaults read .GlobalPreferences NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows defaults read com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows /code/pre  The default behaviour should be a "does not exist" error, but if either is set to code0/code Safari will not remember open tabs.  You can restore the default setting with:  precodedefaults delete .GlobalPreferences NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows defaults delete com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows /code/pre  <comment66322> If you have *not* enabled *Close windows when quitting an application* under *System Preferences  General*, Safari reopens all tabs and windows. <comment66323> I haven't touched any settings. Edit: It was enabled by default. <comment66325> §$%&""§! Do you want me to answer still or will you just remove the question? <comment66326> Answer it please. For future Googlers. <comment66348> So I *can* use the Terminal to enable this while leaving the setting in System Preferences as it was? <comment66349> Not really, it only works the other way around. Will edit. <comment68556> This doesn't seem to work for me. The function is disabled in the preferences, but safari still doesn't remember my tabs. When i quit and re-launch, a new window opens, not even in full-screen mode (Which i usually use). I even tried using the terminal command like you said, in the correct way. Help? <comment68561> @Sherwin   I can't really help with that. It's working for me... all I can say is to carefully read the answer again. I tested this in Safari on Mountain Lion. <comment69936> Thanks, that did the trick for me!
