Make a slideshow in iPhoto 9.6.1 showing photos in random order <body> I want to make a slideshow that shows photos in random order, but I don't see the option to do it. I only have an option to sort images by name or date or things that do not apply.  <answer179415> There is no strongempreset/em/strong for random order – but you can switch to random order ("shuffle order") while the slideshow is actually playing:     "emWhile a slideshow is playing, move the pointer to make the slideshow controls appear, and then click the Settings button/em"    The settings button is the little emcog wheel icon/em next to the close [X] button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SYBkZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Clicking the settings button in play mode will open an extended preferences panel, featuring an additional option "emShuffle slide order/em" in the lower third of the panel:     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4Hpq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Checking/unchecking that option will toggle the Shuffle mode.  You can find a detailled description on this page "Change slideshow settings"at support.apple.com – it's for iPhoto 9.5 but should also apply for iPhoto 9.6.  <comment224510> The shuffle slide order box isn't clickable. You can see that it is a slightly darker tint above. <comment224594> I think the screenshot was made from an image folder I just created for that screenshot, containing only 1 image –– I suppose the slideshow option was 'inactive' because there was only one image in that folder. I now took another screenshot from a multi-image settings panel and updated the screenshot. <comment321796> This is no longer possible in Photos, the iPhoto replacement. Any ideas?
