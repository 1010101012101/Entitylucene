How should I go about tracking down my stolen iPhone 6 using Find My iPhone? <body> I have used Find My iPhone to track down my iPhone 6.   It's running iOS 8 and the iCloud web app shows that someone has travelled a fair distance with it.   How should I go about protecting access to my data on the deviceas well as not ruin all chances of finding it.  My worry is sending a remote wipe will reduce the chance they can get my data but I won't be able to track the device further.  <answer179764> ol liRemote-Lock the phone so they can't use it./li liVisit your local police./li /ol  <comment219041> This.  Once you perform step 1, they have an expensive yet useless brick.
