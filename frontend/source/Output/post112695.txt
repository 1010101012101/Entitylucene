What debug information is available on iOS <body> Is there any logs that would give (for example) some indication of what caused codeUnable to connect to X/code errors when trying to connect to a Wifi hotspot, with iOS 7.x?  The seeming lack of information as to the cause of many failures + error messages on this OS doesn't help technical people like myself start the troubleshooting processes anywhere logical.  <answer112698> I think there are two possibilites to get log information.  First sync your device with your Laptop / PC via iTunes. Then go to:  OS X  precode~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/&lt;your iPhone’s name&gt;/ /code/pre  Windows XP  precode%APPDATA%\Apple\Logs\CrashReporter\&lt;your iPhone’s name&gt;\ /code/pre  Windows Vista+  precode%APPDATA%\Apple\Logs\CrashReporter\MobileDevice\&lt;your iPhone’s name&gt;\ /code/pre  Second use the iPhone Configuration Tool from Apple.  <comment132335> Thanks CML. Had I known that this would involve another device, would have stated that I run Linux, and try to stay away from iTunes at all costs. Also, for others reading you helpful answer: 1) There appears to be no profile name place holders in the Windows profile paths, leading to extra `\`'s, 2) Personally think it is a good idea to use `%appdata%` environment variable, so that both the drive and differing paths on standard/customized Windows installs aren't an issue, 3) I think that the last path will be Vista +, right? 4) Are you sure that it is "Apple computer", and not just "Apple"? <comment132336> However, are you aware of WLAN connection failures in these logs, or just other ones? On another note - Interesting tool you linked to... Will have to check that out. Lastly, upon returning to this page moments ago, I saw a prompt that there was 2 answers to this question - Did you see/know anything about, the other? <comment132372> I am not quite sure with the Windows paths because I haven't used Windows in a while. So the Windows paths are from memory :) <comment132373> I do not know how to get the crash logs via Linux. But my first attempt would be to mount the iOS device under Linux and do a search for CrashReporter or log.. <comment132374> %appdata% edited <comment132375> I haven't seen a second answer.. maybe deleted?
