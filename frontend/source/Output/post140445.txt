How does Activity Monitor get the URLs related to a "Safari Web Content" process? <body> Does anyone know how codeActivity Monitor.app/code gets the list of URLs that are related to a codeSafari Web Content/code process? Those processes show up as codecom.apple.WebKit.WebContent/code in codeps/code output.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJXrO.png" alt="mouse popover showing URLs in Activity Monitor"  <comment165548> Somewhat related AD thread: [Has anyone figured out how to identify the unique page of each separate Safari Web Content process with Safari 7/Mavericks?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/106866/13833)
