Get first item in list using AppleScript <body> How do I get the first item from a list into a variable?  I'm trying to get the first window of an application's windows.  I tried  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat with theProcess in processes         if not background only of theProcess then             if processName is "Xcode" then                 set theWindow to first window of windows             end if         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  but it throws this error:     Can't get window of every window.   <answer285258> Unless you have an explicit need for going about it in the manner shown in your question, I'd keep it much more simple and use:  precodetell application "System Events" to set isRunning to exists (processes where name is "Xcode") if isRunning then set theWindow to (first window of application "Xcode") /code/pre  Otherwise, modifying your existing emcode block/em in the following manner will get that same result as the two lines of emcode/em above:  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat with theProcess in processes         if not background only of theProcess then             if name of theProcess is "Xcode" then                 tell application "Xcode"                     set theWindow to first window of application "Xcode"                 end tell             end if         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  If you want to use the first two line of emcode/em in my answer in a more tokenized manned, as an example, use:  precodeset appName to "Xcode" tell application "System Events" to set isRunning to exists (processes where name is appName) if isRunning then set theWindow to (first window of application appName) /code/pre  Then all you need to do is set codeappName/code to the target app in the first line of emcode/em and the two lines of emcode/em following it stand as is and do not need to be edited for use with other app names.  <comment359682> What does the `isRunning` keyword? <comment359683> I don't want the name of the window. <comment359685> @Iulian Onofrei, `isRunning` is  not a _keyword_, it's a _variable_, which gets set to either `true` or `false` depending on if the process exists. If you don't want the name of the window, what do you want? <comment359687> The window object, if there is such thing. I somehow want to retrieve some checkboxes in that window. <comment359689> @Iulian Onofrei, I've edited it to give the `window` not the `name`. <comment359694> @Iulian Onofrei, I just wanted to add that `if isRunning then` is equivalent to `if isRunning is equal to true then`, so, depending on the actual _value_ of `isRunning`, it equates to either `if true is equal to true then` or `if false is equal to true then` ... So the remaining _code_ on that line only executes if the _value_ of `isRuning` is `true`. <comment359696> Yes, I understood that after your previous comment, thank you! <comment359698> @Iulian Onofrei, I figured you did, but wanted to make sure, and also have it available for others that might read this thread and don't have a full understanding of how the _code_ works. :)
