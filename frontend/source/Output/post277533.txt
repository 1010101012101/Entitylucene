How to stop Finder from jumping to folder when dragging and dropping? <body> Is there a way so Finder won't automatically jump to the folder when dragging and dropping files from one folder to another that's located in the side bar?  I usually just go through my downloads folder and then sort my files manually, but it's a hassle that I always manually have to go back to the download folder to process the next file.  <answer277534> Either disable spring-loading delay or extend the reaction/response time. In older systems the settings are available in the Finder Preferences  General or in newer systems in System Preferences  Accessibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q29hz.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Mouse &amp; Trackpad"  <comment349694> Itâ€™s worth mentioning that even after disabling spring-loading, you can always trigger the spring-load action manually by pressing the space bar.
