Disable fn-keys for bluetooth keyboard <body> I know that there's a setting to change this behaviour, but it doesn't work for my EasyAcc  bluetooth keyboard. If this behaviour is known, does it apply to all not-built-in keyboards or all bluetooth keyboards?  strongEDIT:/strong The setting I'm referring to is:     Use all F1, F2 etc keys as standard function keys   It doesn't have any effect on my bluetooth keyboard. I also tried Palua which also only works on my built-in keyboard.  <answer117949> This appears to be a problem across any number of BlueTooth keyboards designed for iOS when you use them on a Mac. I tested three and all have the same problem.  Attempting to fix it is difficult if not impossible since some testing with my favourite key code tool, Key Codes, shows that the OS is intercepting the keypresses before it gets to the keyboard system.  It's not a BlueTooth problem as two different BlueTooth keyboards designed for a PC allowed the setting to work. For example, the Shintaro Mini I use with my Mini media centre works fine.  <comment137652> I'm not exactly sure what you are asking. Are you saying that you have set the Keyboard System Preference to `Use all F1, F2 etc keys as standard function keys` but this setting is being ignored by your BlueTooth keyboard? <comment137666> Tony: Yes, exactly. <comment137673> Thanks, I have ordered a bluetooth keyboard now. It's too small anyway...
