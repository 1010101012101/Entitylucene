Add email address automatically to address book in Outlook 2011 <body> In Mac Mail app, every time I send an email, the recipients are added automatically to a pool of addresses which are used for auto completion in a later point of time.   For example, I send an email to X, and two weeks later, I just have to type some characters of X's email address and Mac Mail autocompletes the address automatically.   Is this feature possible in Outlook 2011 as well?
