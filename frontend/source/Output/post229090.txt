What's the difference between the Safari iOS cookie settings? <body> On mobile Safari there are 4 settings for cookies:  ol liAlways block/li liAllow from current website only/li liAllow from websites I visit/li liAlways allow/li /ol  #1 makes sense but I am unable to distinguish the 3 remaining options.  Other browsers have settings to allow all cookies (could be #3 or #4 above) or only from the current website (eg on example.com don't allow cookies from thirdparty.com; could be #2 or #3 above).  So what is the third behaviour? And which option is which?  <answer229097> The Safari for Mac Documentation has a good explanation of these settings. They apply to iOS Safari cookies settings, too.  ul listrongAlways Block/strong - Block all first-party cookies and block all third-party cookies./li listrongAllow from Current Website Only/strong - Allow all first-party cookies and block all third-party cookies./li listrongAllow from Websites I Visit/strong - Allow all first-party cookies and block all third-party cookies unless that third party was a first party at one time (based on current cookies and browsing history)./li listrongAlways Allow/strong - Allow all first-party cookies and allow all third-party cookies./li /ul  <comment279486> "Cookies are deleted after navigating away" -- which cookies? Until recently I had that option selected and cookies weren't deleted. <comment279487> Looking at your link, options 2 &3 are not what you've written here. The two descriptions on the link sound identical. <comment279534> This website seems to agree with me: http://cookies.how/en/safari-for-iphone But you're right, Apple's documentation is vague. But maybe we're all wrong! I'll see if I can find some more definitive information. <comment279535> Okay, this other site has an explanation that I think makes the most sense. https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-enable-cookies/safari-ipad I'll update my answer to reflect this explanation.
