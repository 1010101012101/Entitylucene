Apple Mail to show receipts information from LDAP <body> When using Exchange with Outlook, you can easily click in any email sender name and get his photo, name, mobilesâ€¦ etc.  Currently, is this possible to be done with Apple Mail using LDAP directory?  I'm using Apple mail with IMAP and I have Apple Contacts configured with LDAP, and I would love to see such integration between them so I don't have to switch between the 2 apps just to check someone information  Any way to upgrade Apple Mail (somehow) to have it as a business client email?  Note: I'm not looking to change Apple Mail, I click the speed and the integration with Mac in general.
