Songs in playlist - Apple Music <body> I have an apple music subscription and then decided to make some cool playlists.  But now, my library is FULL of albums that I never play outside of my playlists, an ugly ugly nightmare. I guess my question is: strongHow can I have songs in playlist but not in the library?/strong  I don't want to see them outside of the playlist!  <answer222663> Short answer is - you can't.  The Library is your total structure, containing everything.br Playlists are made from the overall structure.  You can delete a song from a Playlist without removing it from the Library - but if you delete a song from the Library, it will also delete it from all Playlists.  <answer294295> In the newest versions of the iTunes (tested on the 12.6.2.20), you can uncheck the box in the Settings, to emnot/em add songs to your library when adding them to your playlists (see screenshot with the red arrow pointing to the checkbox).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5UBVe.png" alt="itunes-no-library-checkbox"
