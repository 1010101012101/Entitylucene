No game achievements in steam at all <body> Buy the game Monochroma some time ago and no one achievement has earned until I passed it. Already trying to get help in steam forum, but nothing. Maybe anyone have this kind of problem on mac platform with steam games? Thanks for watching!  <answer162560> Steam uses OS X's Accessibility API for the Steam Overlay (Shift+Tab screen) and to communicate between the game and Steam.app. You probably enabled it when you installed Steam. Unfortunately, every time you update Steam (this is a bug in OS X) you must uncheck and re-check the box in System Preferences. If you're having this issue on your Mac but not Windows, that's the reason.  Just go to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongPrivacy/strong  strongAccessibility/strong, unlock using the icon in the bottom left, and uncheck and re-check Steam.  <answer163104> I'd try:  ol liMake sure all your OSX updates are installed/li liFollow 0942v8653's suggestion and toggle off the Accessibility API for steam/li liCompletely remove Steam/li liReboot/li liReinstall Steam/li liToggle back on the Accessibility API/li liReboot/li /ol  There may well be better ways, but this is my hip-shot guess on this one.  <answer163838> You need to give Steam access in the accessibility settings and then you may need to restart Steam and or reinstall. I have had a similar issue where Steam does not detect that it has been given permission in the settings and it was fixed by a quick reinstallation of Steam.  <comment190086> How is that a Mac problem?, what Mac do you have? <comment190162> Yeah, only in my MBP latest 2013. <comment190164> Thanks, but not helping for me. Trying it for many times - but no changes. <comment191035> Unfortunately, not help too. I think it's a game issue. <comment191897> Already try this kind of variant - not help. Anyway, thanks for the answer! <comment191898> Weird! Whenever I have had this issue that has worked. Wait, that was on Mavericks! Let me try now! <comment191904> Now, I am experiencing a similar issue. <comment191907> As i said above, I think it's all about this game - "Monochroma", other games achievements work fine. <comment191908> Weird, I experienced it on other games to. <comment191910> "Work fine" for games in my list of course. <comment191944> Yeah, I think it may have something to do with the type of game. <comment191994> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/19807/discussion-between-benjamin-and-kirbrown). <comment212887> Any more variants?
