iOS Untrusted Developer error when testing app <body> I am trying to make my own iOS applications by using Xcode 7 and iOS 9.0. I have successfully been able to install the app on my own iPod by following these steps however when I run the application I get this error: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vc0qm.png" alt="enter image description here"  I had a quick look in the settings app but cannot find a way to allow this application that I made. How would I 'trust' this application running iOS 9?  <answer206144> Enterprise and other certificates have to be manually trusted on iOS 9 when they didn't have to on iOS 8 and earlier.  ul liOpen the strongSettings/strong app/li liOpen strongGeneral/strong/li liOpen strongProfiles &amp; Device Management/strong/li liChoose the affected profile and trust it/li /ul  If you don't see "Profiles &amp; Device Management" then your device needs to reinstall the app or get the appropriate profile from MDM / other enrollment.  <answer215738> You can also do the following:  ol liIn your iPhone or device, go to Settings/li liGo to General/li liSelect Profile/li liSelect your user account i.e., developer account/li liClick on Trust./li /ol  This should enable you to test your app on your device.  <answer229990> There's a also Xcode solution for this problem. You can read this http://www.iphonehelping.com/7/how-to-fix-untrusted-enterprise-developer-error-ios-9-1  <answer252129> Yup, this isn't an extreme issue. No need to contact the dev. You can go to the Settings app and it will be resolved in there. See if this here can help.  <comment248523> It just appears 'profiles' <comment250761> Do we know if there is going to be a long term solution to this problem? Or is this it? <comment250767> @DickieBoy I believe Apple sees this as the long term solution to security. I would plan for this not changing period, but certainly not changing under iOS 9 updates. I would see if your MDM can push the trust profile to devices if you don't want your users to have to tap to manually accept the certificate for enterprise development. <comment255161> In my case it just needed network connection to verify the developer (i.e me). Just turned on WiFi and it started working. <comment280886> Please post the information and not just the link. We cannot guarantee the link will last forever. <comment293615> To elaborate on: If you don't see "Profiles & Device Management" -  You need to click to install one of your enterprise apps and when the dialogue box appears stating that the app is from an untrusted source click "Cancel". The act of doing this adds the menu item. See here: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/DistributingEnterpriseProgramApps/DistributingEnterpriseProgramApps.html under Manually Trusting an Enterprise Developer. If the dialogue says Done/Retry instead of Cancel, reboot your phone to clear cache. <comment334420> it works. Click the email address and then click 'trust' button. Then it's time to ROCK. <comment367826> Related: [iOS9 Untrusted Enterprise Developer with no option to trust](https://stackoverflow.com/q/30722883/55075)
