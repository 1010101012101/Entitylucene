Sharing internet connection from WiFi to Thunderbolt Ethernet doesn't work - no DHCP addresses are given out <body> I can't seem to get my MacBook Pro to share the WiFi connection over Ethernet. Here is my configuration as it appears in System Preferences:     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xtMx3.png" alt="Internet Sharing settings"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WoYw2.png" alt="Network settings"   As you can see, my local Ethernet IP address is a self-assigned IP and the connected device does not receive an IP address.  I see the following messages in my Console when I try to enable Internet Sharing:  precode2/18/16 4:40:11.421 PM InternetSharing[9126]: missing dhcp parameters: start address 10.168.2.0, end address  or mask  2/18/16 4:40:11.422 PM configd[60]: sharing service over en5 failed /code/pre  Clearly I have a misconfiguration somewhere. How do I fix this?  <answer254230> I was able to do this by manually configuring the address of the MacBook Ethernet port as 192.168.2.1 and manually configuring the device I attached to connect to 192.168.2.1.
