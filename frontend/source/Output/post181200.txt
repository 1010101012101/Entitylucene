Chrome / Safari unable to connect to internet while Firefox can <body> I am using Mac book pro with OS X 10.9.5 at work. To connect to internet, I am  connecting over Wifi and VPN. Also I have to use a proxy server in order to connect to Internet.  With that setup, Firefox is able to access internet (I enable Manual proxy settings in Firefox and have the same settings as in Mac Network proxy settings window). But Chrome / Safari is unable to access the internet and Chrome shows me this error message: Dns_probe_finished_no_internet  It seems like both Chrome / Safari uses the system settings for Proxy while Firefox uses separate proxy settings (but both settings values are same).  Is there a way to fix this issue?
