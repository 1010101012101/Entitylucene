Increase horizontal speed scroll on Logitech Mouse <body> I have a Logitech Mouse with a horizontal-scroll-enabled scroll wheel (it tilts left and right to scroll left and right) the only problem is that the scroll speed is very very slow to a point it is not worth using.  The normal mouse settings do not appear to alter the scroll speed at all.  <answer23140> Download the Logitech Control Center here. It will allow you to change the settings.  <comment65031> What about shift-scroll? How do you slow that down? <comment65051> @Jeeve Slowing shift-scroll down? Are you using a Logitech mouse, or are you talking about just in general?
