How can I mount SFTP/SSH in Finder on OSX Snow Leopard? <body> My Question is seemingly simple. I need to mount an ssh/sftp volume and make it visible in finder to be able to use it as if it were a local volume (think smb share). I have tried everything I could find (MacFUSE + sshfs(whatever version), Macfusion(couldn't install),...).  Is there anyway to do this seemingly simple thing? It feels like I'm missing something here. Also, I'm not looking for an sftp client for download/upload. My personal machine is an Ubuntu box, and that's easily doable on that.  Help?  <answer5210> Well, MacFusion emwas/em going to be my answer but since you've tried that I'll recommend my second favourite app when it comes to mounting shares: Panic's Transmit. It's new, very awesome, feature lets you mount any share that it can connect to in the UI as a "disk" in your Finder that you can drag files to. SFTP, SSH, S3...very cool.  <answer5305> Best ones that you can use are Transmit, like has been said before, or Expandrive, which is probably more like what you're looking for, as finder integration is its main feature.  <answer9754> Another solution is WebDrive (35$+). I successfully used the Windows version of the same product, so I expect the same from the OS X version. Too bad, that they require you to buy separate licenses for Windows and OS X.  <answer30811> I use Cyberduck for this task. It's a cross-platform (but native on mac) app that is full of features and it's free to use. You can support the developers by donating or buying it directly from the Mac App Store.  The developer also has an application named Mountainduck which let you mount the path you want to a folder and access it through Finder app.  <answer48731> I can connect to a regular ftp server or an sftp (ssh) server using these in Finder's Connect To Server dialog:  For ftp: ftp://username@mydomain.com  For sftp/ssh: ftps://username@mydomain.com  So, in theory, you can try ftps://path/to/volume_name  <answer86933> As of March 2013, the current free software solution is Fuse for OS X plus a package for SSHFS (a download link on Fuse for OS X webpage).  Macfusion is a GUI for easy mounting/unmounting remote shares but it needs to be patched to work with SSHFS/Fuse for OS X.  <answer182402> I use Filezilla, its free, connect as sftp.  <answer193043> The best solution I've found today (2017) is to use Homebrew and Cask to install osxfuse and sshfs:  precodebrew cask install osxfuse brew install sshfs /code/pre  And then:  precodesshfs username@hostname:/remote/directory/path /local/mount/point -ovolname=NAME /code/pre  It works! :-)  <answer251497> If you already have codeFUSE for OS X/code installed (e.g. you got it directly from SourceForge), then @eskatos solution can reduced to just installing codesshfs/code instead of the whole cask which includes FUSE.  You can do this by using:    precodebrew install homebrew/fuse/sshfs /code/pre  You might want to check if you have the latest version of codeFUSE for OS X/code through your codeSystem Preferences/code while you're at it.  <comment5299> ok so never mond... Macfusion worked. Apparently, downloading with safari worked while downloading with firefox 4 beta 8 didn't <comment5303> @Ous: good stuff. MacFusion is pretty sweet. Can't be free even if the interface is a clunky. If you want a slicker interface Transmit will do what MacFusion does (plus a whole lot more) and look damn good doing it. <comment44264> If I'm not mistaken, Cyberduck does not let you access the files via Finder.  It is a great client though. <comment54080> @radven Oh yeah, you're right, it doesn't. Sorry for that, please ignore my answer. <comment94156> ftps is not the same as sftp. <comment123817> and further neither are the same as ssh. <comment213238> sftp is not supported from finder.. <comment217090> @avee Stackexchange actually lets you delete your answer; this would seem like a good reason. <comment217119> FTPS means FTP over SSL; and SFTP means SSH File Transfer Protocol, and is more secure than FTP or FTPS <comment263728> how can this answer receive up votes? <comment264018> @CousinCocaine not sure. Did you find a better answer than the ones provided on this page? <comment264021> @eskatos his/her answer worked for me on el capitan. <comment268519> I don't see files mounted this way in finder for some reason <comment279563> My #1 issue with MacFusion is that it doesn't support key-based authentication, so I can't use it with the server I usually use.  Transmit handles that nicely (but isn't free). <comment284880> I guess you would have to mount the disk under /Volumes, no? <comment284881> There's probably quite new thing from Cyberduck people and it seems to do the job: [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io) <comment285202> The mount point can be any folder that the current user has write access to. You can create a wrapper shell script: `mkdir -p "/Volumes/$1"; sshfs remote_user_name@$1:/ "/Volumes/$1" -ovolname=$1 && open "/Volumes/$1"`, and then call the script passing it the IP address, i.e. `mountssh.sh 192.168.1.123`. On success Finder will automatically open the remote folder. <comment294308> Be careful when using this tool to mount in Volumes.  I messed up and specified /Volumes (itself) as the mount point and it killed the folder.  I know...dumb, but...it happened.  That made Finder unhappy.  Disk repair fixed it but it was a scary 20 minutes. <comment334700> Transmit "just works". Much better than having to setup samba. SFTP over SSH and you're done. <comment335236> I get: No available Casks for sshfs <comment335297> @JensTimmerman, sshfs moved from a brew cask to a brew tap, updated the answer, see above <comment366644> it's not cross platform if it doesn't support any linux distro, Filezilla does the job more consistently.
