Invisible pictures in system applications <body> While just browsing through apps like the CoreServices in both Mac and iOS, I found that most (all?) of the pictures have sizes and memory, but don't show anything when I quick look or open them. What is going on?  <answer47374> The images stored in CoreServices, such as those in code/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/code, should be easily viewable in Finder â€” though, the majority of these are in the codeicns/code format. I'm also able to view the codepng/code images inside codeDock.app/code. (Which particular images can't you view?)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wk5gQ.png" alt=""  But most codepng/code images on iOS are strongoptimized for display on iOS/strong (which involves switching some color channels and otherwise reducing the file size), so you can't view them in OS X without some preprocessing. See this blog post for more information.  <comment54269> Right now, what I was looking at was SpringBoard. I'll try copying them to the Pictures folder so I can view them on the iPhone. Thanks! <comment54271> There are tools such as [iPhonePNGApp](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/29611/iphonepngapp) which can convert the files for you, as well.
