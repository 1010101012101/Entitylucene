Xcode 5 syntax coloring file type recognition of .css <body> At the moment I am developing a website and I need to edit lots files of the types code.html/code, code.js/code, code.css/code and code.pl/code. My preferred text-editor is Xcode (now in Version 5.1.1) running on an iMac (OS X 10.9.3). For this tasks I am emNOT/em using Xcode as an IDE. I use it just as a text editor.  In the finder I right-click the file that I want to edit and select codeopen with ▶︎/code  codeXcode/code to open it. When I do this for code.html/code, code.js/code and code.pl/code Xcode automatically uses the correct kind of syntax coloring to highlight keywords, comments etc. in the source-code.  But when I open a code.css/code file the same way then there is no highlighting automatically activated by Xcode. The complete text is written in black letters on white background. I can manually select codeEditor/code  codeSyntax Coloring ▶︎/code  codeCSS/code in Xcode to get the correct highlighting. But I hate to do this 50 or 100 times a day when Xcode can do this for any other file type automatically.  I want Xcode to always automatically use the CSS-highlighting when it opens a code.css/code file. How can this be done?  <comment162573> This appears to be a bug. In Standard file types.pbfilespec, there is an entry that says: code {         Identifier = text.css;         BasedOn = text;         Extensions = (css);         MIMETypes = ("text/css");         Language = "xcode.lang.css";     },/code So it should be working properly, yet I am having the same issue. <comment162732> @Alex: Where can I find this file? I can't find it using spotlight. <comment162848> It is within the Xcode application package, so it is not indexed with spotlight.
