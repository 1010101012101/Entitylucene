Terminal goes slow after install Mavericks OS <body> After I've update my OS to Mavericks.  Terminal goes really slow, I've found out that the problem must be from Xcode.  While I remove Xcode from my computer terminal works fine, and after I installed Xcode,  it goes slow again.(It takes like 2 second for codels/code command)  Please help.  PS. my computer is MacBook Pro with Retina.  <answer107874> I had the same problem to and I was looking for the way to solve it.  Checking at the issue that Adam Albrecht commented, it looks like the problem was being caused by the zsh vi-mode plugin in combination with the apple provided git.  Installing git from homebrew solve the problem without having to deactivate the vi-mode plugin  <comment126522> Are you using ZSH and the vi-mode plugin? https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/2189 <comment126528> I've just solved it after reset my `.zshrc`. thanks! <comment126529> yeah, I've solve the problem after reset my `.zshrc`. thanks <comment129945> Excellent answer! The update apparently mixed up my path so the system git was before brew git. Now everything works again. Thanks! <comment233854> Installing git via homebrew worked for me. Thanks
