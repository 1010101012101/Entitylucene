Viewing the progress of a corestorage revert operation? <body> I'm in the middle of migrating to some newer hardware, and to make this a little bit easier on myself, I'm decrypting my hard drive on the older machine. To do so, I've run:  precodediskutil corestorage revert [UUID] /code/pre  I am periodically running the following to monitor:   precodediskutil corestorage list /code/pre  Unfortunately, this only tells me that it's "converting" and leaves me with no progress or timing information. Do I have any way to know how far along the conversion is? I'd be happy even with a raw value, such as the number of processed blocks.  Note: I'm aware that I didn't emhave/em to decrypt the drive, but I wanted to take an offline disk image with ddrescue for safe keeping, and the destination storage will be encrypted. Accessing encrypted images on anything other than OSX is quite hokey/experimental, so I'm avoiding the problem entirely by removing it first. I'm not concerned about this (short) window where my data is not completely protected.
