Taglocity "Clone" For Mac Outlook 2011? <body> I'm a huge user of Taglocity on Windows (Outlook 2010).  Being a recent convert to a Mac, I'm very interested in using the Outlook app from Mac Office 2011.  However, I can't get by without some at least basic functionality that I depend on from Talocity, which is Windows-only.  The most important feature is the ability to strongautomatically/strong keyword tag emails as they are sent and received strongand/strong to have those tags follow emails that are subsequently sent/received in that thread.  Workflow is typically something like this --  ol liI receive an email.  Take a look at it and strongmanually/strong tag it with the "Widget" and "Red" keywords./li liI reply/forward that email and my response is strongautomatically/strong tagged with the same keywords./li liA new email arrives from the same thread.  It is strongautomatically/strong tagged./li liRinse, repeat.../li /ol  A simple keyword search/filter mechanism is needed as well.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
