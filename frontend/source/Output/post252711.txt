Sync Apple notes app on MacBook to Android <body> I recently got an Android phone, and I wanted to know how to sync Apple Notes to Google Keep. I have added my Gmail account to the Apple Notes app, but I don't see the notes showing up in Google Keep. What do I do?  <answer252718> Synchronizing Apple Notes to Gmail puts the notes under a Notes section within Gmail itself.  Google Keep has a synchronization feature, but it's only accessible from Google Keep apps on other platforms and cannot sync with or import from any non-Keep apps. Several years ago, Google stated they were going to be introducing sync to Google Drive within a few weeks, but that never materialized. (The only available interaction with Google Drive is to export a note to Drive as a document, but the reverse is not possible.)  Your options are to continue to use Apple Notes and interact with them in Gmail, or to use the Google Keep web app or a relatively poorly-reviewed Chrome app.
