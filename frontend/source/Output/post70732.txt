How to initiate a specific keystroke using automator? <body> I have the following code :  precodeon run {input, parameters}     if application "KeyboardViewer" is running then         quit application "KeyboardViewer"     else         activate application "KeyboardViewer"      end if     return input end run /code/pre  ul liI want to press kbdALT/kbd + kbdTAB/kbd automatically after I activate application so that I can start typing right away .. /li liReason to do this is because the keyboard becomes the foreground running application and the webpage or typing area the background. /li /ul  <answer70758> You can use the codekeystroke/code scripting command available through the System Events application.  Add the following block to your script below (and at the same indent level as) the codeactivate/code:  precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke tab using {command down} end tell /code/pre  This will simulate kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd and have the effect of switching applications.  To simulate the "ALT" modifier key, use codeoption/code in place of codecommand/code in the above.  <comment82172> In my answer, since you wanted to switch applications, I assumed you meant CMD+TAB as opposed to ALT+TAB. My answer reflects this assumption however, if this is incorrect please tell me and I'll update my answer. <comment82173> Have you tried using launch instead of activate like in my answer to the [previous question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/59875/how-to-open-or-toggle-keyboard-viewer-by-a-keyboard-shortcut/59891#59891)?
