How to add photos for contacts in iPhone 6s? <body> I want to add photos for every contact in my phone; I tried to for some time but I haven't found any way to set it up.   Can someone suggest me the better ways to do it?   <answer282843> Unless I'm missing something from your question, all you need to do is:  ol liLaunch the Contacts app/li liSelect a contact/li liTap on Edit (at top right)/li liNow the circle at top left will show the emadd photo/em text/li liTap on emadd photo/em/li liA prompt will appear with three options:  ul liTake Photo/li liChoose Photo/li liCancel/li /ul/li liSelect emTake Photo/em if you want to take a photo to use, or select emChoose Photo/em if you want to pick one from your Photos app./li liThe rest should be self-explanatory/li /ol  If I've misunderstood your question, let me know.  <comment356462> You need to tell us what OS you're using and if you want to add an individual photo per contact or add the same photo to all your contacts or something else?  There's hundreds of sites that will show you how to add a photo to a contact so the more info you can provide the better our answer can be. <comment356463> @fsb IOS 10.3.1 latest update. Yeah I need individual photo per contact, I checked on few sites but those are not helpful for me.
