SafariExtensionBar: keep toolbar extension displayed in fullscreen <body> I created a safari toolbar extension as described here:  https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/AddingExtensionToolbars/AddingExtensionToolbars.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009977-CH5-SW2  Everything works fine, however, when safari is opened in fullscreen the toolbar is hidden by default and shows only when the mouse is moved to the top of safari.  Is there a way to always show the bar?  Thanks, Matthias
