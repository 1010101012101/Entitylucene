Mac Mini, users with permissions cannot connect <body> I have a Mac Mini Server with File Sharing enabled, but when I go to connect any of my users that aren't allowed to "Administer this server" I get a connection failed error. But If I give them Admin rights they can instantly connect.  How can I allow all users to connect and share files?  <comment100589> On the share what permissions have you given? <comment100617> The Group has full permissions, but they still aren't able to connect..?
