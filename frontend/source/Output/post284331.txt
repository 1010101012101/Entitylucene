Add script to Dock Icon ("right click") <body> Is it possible to modify the menu that pops up when you right click an icon in the Dock bar? for example add a script/service?   Thanks! /Anton  <comment358700> @user3439894 either you missunderstood me or I'm missinterpreting the link you sent, I'm not talking about adding menu item to an app/icon I'm developing, I'm talking about adding to existing apps/icon... I'm more used to Ubuntu so maybe i have to high hopes of what is possible in osx??
