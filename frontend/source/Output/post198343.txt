Cannot hear music on my iPhone 5S <body> I can't hear sound in my iPhone. I can't listen to music or any sound on my device. I'm frustrated trying to solve this.  <answer198346> Hi and welcome to Ask Different!  A few things to try:  ul liMake sure the mute switch is off and working - on the top left side of the phone there's a switch that has a red backing if it's turned on. If it's showing red, toggle it back, and your sound will come back on. Simple :)/li liIf that does nothing, make sure the switch works. Toggle it back and forth a few times, there should be a popup indicating that sound is now muted. If nothing appears on the screen when the switch is toggled, the switch is probably broken, and you'll need to talk to Apple or your carrier's insurance about getting it fixed./li liI'm guessing you already tried this, but there are two volume settings on iOS, one for the ringer and one for apps and music. If you just use the volume rocker in most places, your ringer volume changes. If you use it while music or sound is playing, app volume changes. Make sure that your music/sound volume is up./li /ul  <answer198351> Do you hear sound with EarPods in? If so, it's likely that your speaker has gone out and needs to be replaced.  <comment237326> Are you using headphones or are you having trouble with the speaker? <comment301897> Just to note: if the app is a conventional music/video player, then it can play the track's audio regardless of the mute switchâ€”assuming volume is not set to zero.
