How to determine carrier for iPhone? <body> I have an iPhone 5c and I need to determine the carrier for it. How can I do this?   The phone is not currently activated and I do not have a sim. I need to determine the carrier so I know what sim to obtain.  <comment305321> Settings  carrier - or take the SIM out & look at it <comment305322> The phone is not activated and I do not have a sim. <comment305400> If the phone was ever activated you can go to 'Settings - About' and look at the entry under 'Carrier'.  That should show the last carrier that it was locked to.  Do you see anything there? <comment305455> I cannot get to settings at all. The phone is not currently activated. <comment305546> lol you can't.. Unless it's on the box. Just try different sims. I never had problems switching sims in different countries? Are you assuming that your iPhone is carrier locked, or do you know it?
