OS X based RFID Printing Solution <body> We are in the process of upgrading our servers at our school. Right now we use Safecom to manage our print queues for each user. Each user that is allowed to print can do so via logging in using an RFID printer tag.   What I would like to know is whether there is a similar solution that runs on OS X?   It should be able to:  ul liAllow users to push their jobs to the printer, collecting them later using the RFID tag to log in./li liAllow administrators to check how many jobs have been sent, cancel jobs, add users and so on/li liAllow us to import users from a directory service of some kind/li /ul
