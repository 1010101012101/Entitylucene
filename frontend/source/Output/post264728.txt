How do I reset my monitor configuration? <body> I have 3 monitors attached.  This is what the displays preference page looks like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGJZz.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I unplug one, I get this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JkB2I.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seems like the configuration for 3 monitors became corrupt while I was moving the monitors into a more desireable configuration.  How do I change them back?  EDIT: Turning mirroring on and off again did not resolve my issue.  <comment331865> Have you tried turning mirroring on and then back off? That has fixed things for me in the past. <comment331875> Considering the display is controlled by the SMC, have you tried a SMC reset?
