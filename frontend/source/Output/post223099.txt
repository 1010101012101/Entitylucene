How do I disable or turn off Burst Mode photos in iPhone 6s? <body> Whenever I use the self-timer modes (either 3s, or 10s), my iPhone takes a burst of photos no matter what. Is there a way too disable this  <answer223110> Check here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6674023?start=0&amp;tstart=0  "Turn the flash to "ON" and photo burst is disabled."  <answer263449> Enabling the flash is one way to disable burst photos in strongTimer/strong mode. You can also force HDR emOn/em.  I much prefer enabling strongHDR/strong for this purpose, as it often yields better photos anyway. LED flash can drastically alter your scene in ways that may not be pleasing at all.
