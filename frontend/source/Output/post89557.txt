Country changed and purchases are no longer visible <body> I changed country no on purpose. On the day of creating account I had Russian store because there was no Kyrgyzstan country and my Kyrgyzstan cart was accepted for russian store. Because Kyrgystan in fact almost part of Russia.  No my account tells me that this card is not eligibly in this country. So what do i do? Change country and I lose all may purchases. (not really lose just not listed and no automatic updates)  There should be tool to transfer all transferable purchases to new Country.  In the mean time I was in Philippines and my Kyrgyzstan CC had expired. i could not update it and I had to use Philippines one. And it worked just fine for Russian store too.  But now I cannot do anything. I thought to use NONE for payment options and use coupones and certificates to make purchases just to keep my original country. But it does not allow to enter NON as payment option ether.   <comment105157> Try to log out and log in again. <comment105194> So you can't select payment method NONE like is suggested [here](http://absinthejailbreak.com/forum/how-to-remove-credit-card-details-from-itunes/)? SImilar question on [A.SE here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/39560/updating-software-from-app-store-not-available-for-purchased-items/39856#39856). I don't suppose [tutorial on making an apple id without a cc will helpâ€¦](http://absinthejailbreak.com/forum/how-to-create-free-itunes-account-without-credit-card/) <comment105246> I do not want another account. And create account without CC is not the same as make CC account without CC. And yes I cannot remove CC as apple do not save my account without CC and tell that it fail I have to try next time later.
