Too many redirects occurred trying to open GMail by clicking on the icon on the Goggle Webpage. <body> Gmail was loading fine until yesterday when it suddenly stopped. I get the message "Safari can't open the page - Too many redirects occurred trying to open"  I get the same message if I just try to load Gmail by typing in the Gmail webpage. Gmail loads fine from Explorer and Firefox (on another Laptop)  Any ideas for an inexperienced Apple User  <comment213866> What version OS X & Safari? That used to happen on Safari 5/6 but I haven't seen it in a long time.
