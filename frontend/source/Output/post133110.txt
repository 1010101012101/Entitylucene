Type backslash more easily on Japanese wireless keyboard <body> In order to write \ on a Japanese wireless keyboard we have to use kbdalt/kbd+kbd¥/kbd. Very very inconvenient actually. Especially with Swift, the use of \ will sky rocket... Alt is bottom left, right of kbdcaps/kbd, and kbd¥/kbd is left of kbddelete/kbd. You absolutely need two hands for this, and alt is close to caps and ¥ is close to delete so all kind of havoc will break loose from time to time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wIdgJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is there anyway to remap this key? Of course I'm mostly using Xcode. Ideally I'd like to remap \ to kbd _ /kbd which is left of the right kbdshift/kbd. Because kbd _ /kbd prints _ both for shifted and unshifted taps, so \ for an unshifted tap would be great.  <answer133121> I was able to download and use Ukulele from http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=ukelele  however while the software seems powerful it's far from easy to use and have keyboards install. The manual is lengthy and takes a while to go through. There's no quick way of fixing things, unless you have a lot of experience I guess. The keyboard layout I created seems to work in Notes, but it does not work in Google Chrome (I couldn't write this comment using it)   Ok so I restarted Google Chrome and can now use the keyboard layout. Seems to work, look \\ :-)  And to add something... Ukulele works on an inherent feature of OS X (the keyboard layout files), just adds an UI on top of it. It would be nice with a simpler solution so if anyone knows feel free to add an answer.  <comment157699> I was able to download and use Ukulele from http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=ukelele however while the software seems powerful it's far from easy to use and have keyboards install.
