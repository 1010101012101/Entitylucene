Problem on shutdown MacBookPro 11.3 <body> My problem is about my MacBookPro 11.3 (code2,6 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB DDR3 a 1600 MHz, NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB/code).  Since I updated to ElCapitan (actually code10.11.1 (15B42)/code), when I shutdown the Mac, it's stuck to the loading image. Then I usually force the shutdown by pressing the codePower/code keyboard button. The next time I start up the Mac, I see the message:     Your Mac has been restarted due to a problem.   I tried having a Apple Diagnostic check (pressing codeD/code while startup), but all is fine.  Anyone has the same problem? How have you tried to solve it?  <answer219798> I would try some standard troubleshooting first...  ul liReset the SMC   ol liShut down the computer./li liPlug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your computer./li liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time./li liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li liPress the power button to turn on the computer./li /ol/li liReset the NVRAM  ol liAt the boot chimes, hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd P /kbd kbd R /kbd /li liKeep holding all 4 keys until you hear the chimes again, then release/li /ol/li liStart in Safe Mode   ol liStart or restart your Mac. /li liImmediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the Shift key./li liRelease the Shift key when you see the Apple logo appear on the screen./li /ol/li liApply the latest Combo Update - currently 10.11.2br you can always find the latest updates at https://support.apple.com/downloads//li /ul  <comment266497> Up to now I just updated and it works fine. A the time I asked the question my MAC hasn't received the OS X Update offer by App Store. If I have some problems I will follow you detailed "instructions" before asking again. Thanks.
