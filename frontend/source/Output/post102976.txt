Automator: Correct syntax for calling an AppleScript file <body> I'm attempting to write an Automator application that will mount an external disk. I have an AppleScript that does the job and I'm attempting to insert it into an Automator application. However, rather than paste in the script I want to call the file, I have the following in Automator:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     run script file "Macintosh HD:Users/username/Documents/Scripts and Automator/mountdrive.scpt" end run /code/pre  However, this produces a syntax error:     Canâ€™t make some data into the expected type.   Any suggestions as to the source of the problem?  <answer102982> Try:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set myScriptPath to (path to documents folder as text) &amp; "Scripts and Automator:mountdrive.scpt"     run script alias myScriptPath end run /code/pre  <answer103028> Apparently the problem with the syntax is that the path needs to be separated by ':' as opposed to '/'. Posix uses '/' and  Apple uses ':'  <answer103053> coderun script/code also accepts a "POSIX path", you don't need the explicit coderun/code handler:  precoderun script "/Users/username/Scripts and Automator/mountdrive.scpt" /code/pre  You could also add a Run Shell Script action where the content is codeosascript ~/Documents/Scripts\ and\ Automator/mountdrive.scpt/code.  <comment121265> Thx for the response. The issue has to do with the separators, they should be ':'
