Mac doesn't show Nvidia in Graphics (about this Mac) <body> Mac doesn't show Nvidia 750M in place of graphics card here. Earlier I had Nvidia showing here instead of Iris Pro  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WYLBA.png" alt=""  <comment301051> I've never checked the About This Mac specifically for the Graphics Info on a dual graphics Mac so it's possible that this info *could* change depending on what chip was active.  A better bet is to run System Report <comment301052> System Information app in (Graphics/Displays) lists both...Iris pro and Nvidia 750M <comment301059> I don't think it's an issue.  The dual graphics model automatically switches chips depending on what is being done.
