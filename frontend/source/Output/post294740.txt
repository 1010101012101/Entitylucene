Black screen on startup? <body> Since last night I've been getting a black screen whenever I start up my MBP. It started when I was using my laptop normally and out of nowhere (as far as I could tell) the screen went black, and restarting didn't solve it. The only way I've found to restore the display is to close the laptop for about a minute and re-open it.  Resetting my SMC and PRAM hasn't helped. The computer is clearly on when the screen is black - the keyboard light is on, and if I press certain keys I can hear sounds. By pressing the play/pause button (F8) I was even able to get iTunes to play a random song :)  There are a couple of other random things that happened alongside this. I can no longer connect to an external display with HDMI (both when the screen is black and when it's normal), nothing is detected. Also, my cursor no longer disappears when I press a key while reading articles in my browser. Strange.  Any thoughts on how to fix this? There's clearly something wrong with the display - I'd like to not have to get the black screen on startup, and also be able to connect to an external display again.  <comment372025> Have you checked that the brightness setting is OK? (i.e. not turned fully down) <comment372040> Yes I have checked that.
