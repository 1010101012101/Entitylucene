Mach-O Documentation <body> I am looking for some documentation about Mach-O file format but managed to find only this one old (2004) document: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/assembly/MachORuntime.pdf.  I would like to find something similar but newer as lots of new load commands were added since then. It is possible to understand some parts about Mach-O from available source codes and by reversing binaries, but it is very difficult and time consuming.  Edit: after further research I found github repository with slightly newer docs (2009). But there is still a lot of information missing. https://github.com/aidansteele/osx-abi-macho-file-format-reference
