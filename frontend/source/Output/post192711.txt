Bluetooth pair with audio device has driver error in bootcamp <body> I am using a MacBook Air 2014. Recently have installed Windows 7 64 bits using Boot Camp.  When I pair the audio device with bluetooth, the device can be detected and pair, but when windows install driver automatically it fail. And I checked the device has error code : 28  I am sure it works as when I use it in OS X, it just pairs without any flaws. So I wonder, do I need to install another bluetooth driver? Thanks for helping.  <comment229427> Hi, adding the model of the audio device will probably be helpful. Did you download, create and install the Boot Camp Drivers disk / USB drive? <comment229460> yes , sure the bootcamp driver is store at the usb stick with using bootcamp assistant to download <comment229461> It is SC-HTE80, there is no driver for that   http://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/home-entertainment/sound-bars/sc-hte80eb.html
