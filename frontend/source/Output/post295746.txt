How can I identify duplicate entries in Numbers? <body> I have started a spreadsheet in Numbers.  I need a way to somehow flag (both) a first name and last name if the name if repeated more than once.  The first name and last name are separated by columns. We are a non-profit and need to flag a name if it is recorded more than one time.  It can be flagged with a * or any type of symbol.   How can I accomplish this in Numbers?  <comment373498> Please have a look at the links in the yellow note above for ways to improve your questions. It also helps if the question has a title related to the problem and appropriate tags. <comment373617> How is the data structured?  First name and last in separate columns or combined?  Would love to help if you can provide a bit more detail.  Cheers <comment373624> Can't try at the moment, but something like countif() or a combination of index() match() may give you a start...
