Does exists some console utility for keyboard layout switching in Mac OS X? <body> For example, there is codexkb-switch/code on Linux. Is there some analog in Mac OS X? I googled but found nothing. Yes I know about AppleScript but it doesn't fit to my purposes.  <answer166612> Ok. I wrote it myself. If you need one see code of utility here (https://github.com/myshov/xkbswitch-macosx) if you want in codebin/code directory there is already compiled version.
