Word 2011 for Mac: keyboard shortcut for turning balloons on/off in review mode <body> Does anybody know if I can create a keyboard shortcut to toggle "Use balloons to display changes"?   Also, is there a webpage where one can vote for features for the next Word release? I want to have the option to show only comments in balloons and not deleted text that existed in previous versions back.   Thanks  <answer99746> There is not one. But you're in luck, because you can assign one using codeTools -&gt; Customize Keyboard/code. See the example below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5kRKv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment57417> I've been requesting this feature (which has been standard in Word for Windows forever) for the better part of a decade. Good luck getting MS to implement it.
