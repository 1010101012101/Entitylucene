Temporary jailbreak of iPhone 4 for purposes of deleting a dictionary <body> I need to temporarily jailbreak my iPhone 4 to fix Apple's iOS 6 bug making it impossible to access Japanese-to-English dictionary.  All I need and want to do is delete Japanese-to-Japanese dictionary.  Is it possible to tethered jailbreak iPhone 4 temporarily, delete the relevant folder, and merrily continue using the device in a non-jailbroken fashion?  <answer92520> strongUnjailbreaking a device without restoring it is currently impossible./strong  If you don't mind using a jailbroken device until it's fixed, you could jailbreak normally, then when Apple releases the fix, just backup with iTunes, restore to the latest iOS, and then restore the backup.  <comment108507> Also, I suppose a related question could be: does iTunes backup/restore the whole `/User/Library/` folder. If so, then you could backup/restore after you jailbreak and be fine. <comment108526> @grgarside No reason for _tethered_ jailbreak per se. I am currently uninterested in jailbreaking the current phone. It does everything I need, except for the dictionary. I'm happy with jailbreaking the tablet, but have no need to do so on the phone. <comment108527> One of the large issues I have with this is the inability to go to-and-from jailbreak as I please. If I jailbroke now, use it jailbroken, then want to undo it -- I can't, because I'll be forcibly restored to 6.1.3, and unable to jailbreak again. I do have 6.1.2 SHSH, but nonetheless. Plus, keeping the phone jailbroken and then simply loading it with a bunch of cr*p like I did on the iPad and previous phones is too tempting. ;-) <comment108539> Why is it so important together rid of that dictionary? <comment108540> @TomGewecke If you google around, the Japanese-to-Japanese dictionary blocks Japanese-to-English dictionary from ever appearing. On iOS 6 only. The only documented solution on iOS 6 is to get rid of the Japanese-to-Japanese dictionary. For a beginner studying a language, a monolingual dictionary is useless; on iOS 5, the bilingual dictionary was practical, detailed and very easy to use. <comment108545> Aha, I had forgotten that. In case it doesn't work out, some app options are at http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2013/02/japanese-english-dictionary-missing-in.html
