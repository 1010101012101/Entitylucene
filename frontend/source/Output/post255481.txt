Can't restore disabled iPhone because not enough disk space <body> I am trying to restore a disabled iPhone 4s so my daughter can use it but iTunes gives the error not enough disk space. Obviously I can't delete anything from the phone because it's disabled. Is there any way to clear up storage space while disabled?  <answer255484> When connecting it to iTunes, I would choose to set it up as a new device, rather than restoring from a backup.  Once you've done that then do the restore on your iPhone from the backup you wanted to use.  strongNOTE:/strong Ensure that you do not do a new backup of your iPhone 4s before doing the restore. You may want to make a backup of your iPhone 4s backup before you begin, just in case. If you're not sure of where the backups are located, refer to this article.  <comment318195> "Not enough disk space"... Are you sure iTunes is not complaining about the computer its running on?  I don't see how iOS will ever warn about "disk" space.
