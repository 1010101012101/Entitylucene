Can I transfer photos from iPhone 4 to a MacBook via Bluetooth? <body> Is there any way to transfer photos from the iPhone 4 camera roll to a MacBook over Bluetooth?  <answer8759> I know you asked if it was possible over Bluetooth and although my research didn't turn up anything for non-jailbroken phones, here is a WiFi solution which you could use on an Ad-hoc network that would work effectively the same way.  h2Non Jailbroken/h2  ul liWiFi: WiFi Photo Transfer (App Store)/li liiPhone to iPhone: Bluetooth Photo Share (App Store)/li /ul  h2Jailbroken/h2  ul liiBlueNova (Cydia)/li /ul  <comment9297> +1 for WiFi Photo Transfer, very useful. <comment9316> I'd recommend renaming to "iPhone to iPhone" because that app only transfer over bluetooth between iPhones, unlike the iBlueNova.
