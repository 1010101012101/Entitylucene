Unable to figure out how to disable/remove growl mail notifications <body> I am trying to get rid of the GrowlMail notification. I have tried to follow instructions posted and can get into the Library to find the Mail folder but do not know how to find the /Library/Mail/Bundles/GrowlMail.mailbundle to remove the mail bundle. I am going in through the finder on OS X 10.9.3  I am a real novice so need clear steps to follow. The steps I have been trying are here: How to remove GrowlMail (on Mavericks)?  <answer132183> In Finder's "Go" menu there is a command "Go to Folder..." (or: kbdshift/kbd + kbdcommand/kbd + kbdG/kbd when Finder is the active application)  If you paste in the code/Library/Mail/Bundles/code it will take you to that folder.  I tried it on my computer and it didn't go (I just got an alert ding) because the folder doesn't exist.  <comment155225> Could you edit your post to include a link to the instructions you are following? also, Welcome to Ask Different! <comment155541> Thank you very, very much! I got it out and am no longer plagued with that message.
