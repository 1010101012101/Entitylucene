How to run Applescript on Disk mount <body> I want to run an Applescript when I mount a specific disk. It isn't if the script is located on the disk or not, it should just run when OS X mounts the disk.  I tried to accomplish this with folder actions, but it looks like it isn't possible to do it this way.  strongClarification:/strong  ol liI get home with my Macbook/li liI plug my USB Hub into the device/li liExternal disks are mounted in OS X/li liMy Applescript gets run, does some stuff on those disks /li /ol  I want to automate step 4.  <answer8092> You don't mention under which context you are mounting the disk, but what about going the other way and mounting the disk with the Applescript?   I mention context because when mounting a disk with Applescript is the big caveat that if it is a network volume, and the network is password-protected, then the user name and password would have to be stored as plain text in the script for a seamless execution.  strongUPDATE:/strong A bit of searching found a similar question elsewhere. Essentially, a script can be made to do this by applying the script as a Folder Action to /Volumes:   precodeon adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items     repeat with aItem in these_items         tell application "Finder"             if (local volume of aItem) and (name of aItem is "[Name of Hard Drive]") then                 -- do something with the drive                 -- eject aItem             end if         end tell     end repeat end adding folder items to /code/pre  <answer8093> A solution would be to create an Automator application chaining the 3 following actions :  ul liGet Specified Finder Items /li liMount Disk Image/li liRun AppleScript/li /ul  <answer8098> Use a Finder FolderAction that monitors /Volumes. When a new folder appears, that means a new disk has been attached. Now your FolderAction can run an Automator action, AppleScript, or shell script to do your thing.  <answer8099> MarcoPolo can do actions based on disk attachment.  <answer13723> The likely most robust solution is to create a codelaunchd/code job with the codeStartOnMount/code property set to code-boolean YES/code:     codeStartOnMount &lt;boolean&gt;/codebr   This optional key causes the job to be started every time a filesystem is mounted.   This is how Time Machine does it (see code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-attach.plist/code).  <answer136827> Depending on your needs, this can be applied to specific folder/mount points and is great to use when mounting a USB flash drive for example...  http://www.jbmurphy.com/2011/07/15/os-x-running-a-script-when-a-usb-drive-is-inserted/  <comment8720> I don't want to mount a disk with AS, I want to *run* an AS when a disk gets mounted. I'll edit my post to make it more clear. <comment8722> Again, I don't want to mount an image or a disk with Applescript, I want to run a script when a disk gets mounted. I can't find a way to accomplish that with your steps. <comment8723> I understood the question, but I don't think it is possible to do this very easily. I did, however, tooled around a bit and found something that should work with a bit of tweaking to meet your needs. <comment8727> Yep, i see after clarification that it doesn't work because that's hard drive you're mounting (and not image disk). <comment8729> I made some small modifications to the script. Works fine :) <comment9797> possible duplicate of [Automatically launch a program or action when an external drive or disk is connected](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5988/automatically-launch-a-program-or-action-when-an-external-drive-or-disk-is-connec) <comment88558> I feel like this is the most robust solution, as it is dependent only on launchd, which is where "this sort of thing" properly resides. <comment315705> This app is discounted, for now should use maintained fork: http://www.controlplaneapp.com/
