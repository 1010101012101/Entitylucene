Terminal prompt does't show on macOS Sierra <body> Since I upgraded to Sierra, Terminal no longer loads my bash prompt, making it unusable. When I start it, it doesn't hang, but it stays looking like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cQfJ5.png" alt=""  I can enter text, but it doesn't do anything. It seems like the bash or tail command is hanging. I have also tried using the terminal window in Android Studio and that just shows a blank screen.  Any idea how I could fix this?  <answer256502> After some debugging I found out that the bash-autocompletion package for brew did cause this. It is clear that if you run code$(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion/code the command does not terminate  As a wordaround, you can uninstall it with codebrew uninstall bash-autocompletion/code. I'd recommend to first update brew by running codebrew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade/code though.   Digging deeper it turned out the main problem here was the rust compiler. Running coderustc --version/code pointed me to a segfault. I uninstalled it using code/usr/local/lib/rustlib/uninstall.sh/code, after which the bash autocompletion started to work again. Removing rust as described, and reinstalling it using brew (codebrew install rust/code) ensured everything worked again  <comment317093> Do you have anything in your ~/.bash_profile or similar? Might try moving any such files to a different folder then trying again. <comment317094> @tubedogg I do, but I have just found that it works if I press ^C. So it doesn't seem to be a problem with bash. <comment317166> Yes it is a problem with your bash scripts. You cave a command that doesn't end..
