Automatically opening multiple Apps / TABs for certain projects <body> I'm trying to improve my workflow when working on certain projects. Depending on what kind of work I'm doing, I'll want certain apps open with certain configurations.  strongExample:/strong  For a web development project, I'll want to open iTerm 2, have 2 horizontal panes. The upper pane will go into the frontend folder, the other one will go into the backend folder. Then, I want to have both folders also open up in Sublime Text.  Ideally, I'd like to have an app or a file or a script or something, that does this for me so that I don't have to do this every time I want to work on whatever project:  precode- Launch iTerm - Hit CMD-ENTER for fullscreen - Hit CMD-SHIFT-D for two horizontal panes - Run "cd to/project/backend" - Run "subl src" to open "src" folder in Sublime Text - Run "vagrant up" - Close Sublime windows I had open last time I quit it - Hit CMD-ALT-UP to go to upper pane - Run "cd to/project/frontend" - Run "subl ." to open new Sublime window here - Launch Chrome and open up my frontend in a new tab /code/pre  That's just one example. When I'm working on something else, I might want Sketch and Keynote open with certain files (no terminal at all).  strongI'm looking for a way to automate these processes. Grateful for any suggestions. Thank you! :)/strong  <answer142433> I would recommend using a 'boot' shell script to do most of what you're describing and bind it to an strongiTerm2/strong profile. You can configure a profile to have a specific window arrangement (it is a feature of strongiTerm2/strong), see strongemiTerm2/strong  Preferences  Arrangements/em to save your current arrangement as a strongpreset/strong.  Then, make a new profile that executes a startup script and applies the aforementioned window arrangement as its default arrangement (strongemiTerm2/strong  Profiles  Open Profiles  Edit Profiles/em). Ideally, you would bind launching this profile to a shortcut, like codeCommand + Control + D/code for one-keystroke access.  In said profile, under the emGeneral Tab  Command/em section, the startup command should be a shell script akin to below:  I don't know why it's necessary for you to open up the sublimetext frontend and backend in different terminal windows. Whenever you run codesubl/code, it opens the app as a daemon, as codesubl/code is just a python wrapper that launches the OS X app.  Sample rough codestartup.sh/code script I scaffolded up for ya:  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash  cd ~/to/project/backend open . # open Finder window of backend folder subl . # open SublimeText instance of backend folder  cd ~/to/project/frontend open . # open Finder window of frontend folder subl . # open SublimeText instance of frontend folder  # Launch chrome and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ or wherever your dev location is open -a "/Applications/Google Chrome.app" 'http://localhost:8000/'   echo 'COME AT ME BRO' /code/pre  You should change the settings on SublimeText to not remember your window/tab arrangements from previous launch instead of attempting to script it to close all of your windows from before.  Alternatively, you could have codesubl/code open a native, code.sublimetext-workspace/code or code.sublimetext-project/code file and achieve more precise results than with codesubl ./code  <comment167800> See what you can do with [Automator](http://sc5.io/blog/2014/01/use-os-x-automator-to-open-workspaces/)
