Free FORTRAN compiler - or one that does not have to be updated all the time <body> I have paid some good money to buy the "Intel Parallel Studio XE Composer Edition for Fortran OS X" - The problem is that, whenever the OS changes (i.e., from Lion to Mountain Lion to Mavericks to Yosemite), the compiler needs update, and purchase of a new version. (Unless you buy a maintenance, approx. $300/yr). Also, sometimes a new version is required even when Xcode is updated!   Two questions:  ol liIs there some free FORTRAN compiler or a non-free, which works after updates of Xcode or/and OS?/li liIs there a way to make it work, even if is was destined for say Mavericks?/li /ol  <answer189033> re free Fortran compilers (Note I don't actually use this so info is as I have picked up in passing, please comment or edit if something is unclear or wrong)  gfortran is part of gcc (gcc stands for GNU Compiler Collection not just the name of GNU's c++ compiler)  Xcode now does not install gcc (even via command line tools) gcc is a link or wrapper to clang  As to installation my first attempt would be via a package manager like Macports or Homebrew or fink.  For macports (others will be similar) install will be  ol liInstall macports as per the guide/li liinstall gcc with the fortran option codesudo port install gcc5/code/li liinstall a select program to allow selection of different gcc versions (in this case there will only be one) codesudo port install gcc_select/code/li liselect the version codesudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc5/code/li /ol  gfortran is now in /opt/local/bin  Macports should download readymade binaries for this so no wait for a long compile of gcc  If you upgrade the OS Macports will need a complete reinstallation (OK it might work but support and test is only done on a complete reinstallation, previous OS upgrade definitely needed one the last 1-2 might have worked)  <comment223960> If you need any Intel compiler you probably do need the maintenance and if you do need it $300/yr is low cost - it will be less than what a professional developer costs for a day including all overheads like benefits, design machines etc ) <comment223962> See http://www.macinchem.org/reviews/fortran/fortran.php for a list of others and Homebrew instructions
