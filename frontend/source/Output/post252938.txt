Can't connect iPhone SE to Macs or PCs <body> it seems I am unable to connect my iPhone to my Macbook and PC. Plug in the lightning cable simply do nothing. I tried with 3 other cable that I know work fine on my other devices. Strangely, I can still plug the phone to a socket to charge the battery.  I dig up a bit, and my Mac shows this logs when the phone is plugged:  precode16/09/2016 02:05:22,000 kernel[0]: 008999.635867 HS05@14200000: AppleUSB20XHCIPort::resetAndCreateDevice: failed to create device, disabling port 16/09/2016 02:05:22,000 kernel[0]: 008999.635891 HS05@14200000: AppleUSBHostPort::disconnect: persistent enumeration failures /code/pre  I tried several things, like erasing all settings and so on. Even DFU mode. No clue. Hardware problems? But why does it still work on an electric socket?  <comment314749> Did u check the iPhone lighting port for pin damage or lint/dirt on the contacts?  Maybe there's something preventing the data connection but allowing charging? <comment314757> When you say PC and only show Mac logs, is it because you are running a Virtual Windows? Also, what OS's and iTunes versions? <comment314763> @norcaljohnny it was a friend's computer. Not virtual Windows. <comment314764> @fbara I did cleaned it up, nothing changed sadly. <comment314818> @alljamin cf. question. (yes). <comment315001> Did you try a different lightning cable?
