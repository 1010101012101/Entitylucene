You can download Xcode (2.1 GB) via App Store.app or the Command Line Tools at developer.apple.com. Both require a valid Apple ID.  The latest CLT release is: Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode April 2014 direct link (~115 MB).  hr  In later system versions you can open Terminal.app and enter codexcode-select --install/code or just codegcc/code to install the necessary tools. You will be asked to either emGet Xcode/em or emInstall/em. Choosing Install will download and install the command line tools only.
