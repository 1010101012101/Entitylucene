Command line tool for interacting with Bluetooth Low Energy devices, similar to gatttool <body> I've just found out that some Python code I've got working on Linux also needs to work on OSX.  For reliability reasons, on Linux I've been using a cludgy but effective approach to reading and writing characteristics on Bluetooth Low Energy devices. I've been simply spawning a subprocess that calls the codegatttool/code command with the appropriate arguments and capturing the output. (None of the libraries that I tried would work reliably).  So now that I have to get it working on OSX, it would be wonderful to just use the same approach, but with a tool that works on OSX. Requirements for the tool are:  ul liRead from an arbitrary bluetooth characteristic on an arbitrary device/li liWrite to an arbitrary bluetooth characteristic on an arbitrary device/li /ul  Is there such a tool for OSX? If not is there a way I can get codegatttool/code working under OSX?  Thanks  <answer286457> GATT isn't exposed on macOS as easily as CoreBluetooth (which you can get to easily from the command line with swift or python and objective c bridging).  ul lihttps://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_BluefruitLE/tree/master/Adafruit_BluefruitLE/corebluetooth/li lihttps://github.com/karulis/pybluez/li /ul  The pybluez code is very well commented and has good nuggets like:     See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/iobluetooth   for Apple's IOBluetooth documentation.      See http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net for details on how to access Objective-C   classes through PyObjC.   If those python examples don't work, then if you are a developer, I would start with the Additional Tools downloads for Xcode (latest beta version). If you're not a developer, then the free Xcode would be where I start to see how quickly you could get to GATT or see if the CoreBluetooth API are suitable for what you want to do.
