Error message "iPod is disabled. Try again in 22,236,924 minutes." <body> I think my son was trying to guess the passcode! What do I do?  I can't wait 42 years!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0NvwQ.jpg" width="300"  <answer49515> No harm done, that is if you have a backup on iTunes.br The Apple Support pages tell you can reset the block by restoring it within iTunes.      If you cannot remember the passcode, you will need to restore your   device using the computer with which you last synced it. This allows   you to strongreset your passcode/strong and strongresync the data from the device/strong (or   restore from a backup). If you restore on a different computer that   was never synced with the device, you will be able to unlock the   device for use and remove the passcode, but your data will not be   present. Refer to Updating and restoring iPhone, iPad and iPod touch   software.   <answer97190> This happened to me when I plugged my iPod Touch to my work computer to charge it. I unplugged it and hooked it up to my personal laptop (the computer with the iTunes account that it is synced to) and it let me put in my password to unlock it! :)  <comment56681> Do you already tried to restore it from iTunes backup? <comment56688> Wonder how they come up with the number 22,236,924. <comment56713> I wonder how man times it took to get to 22,236,924 minutes!
