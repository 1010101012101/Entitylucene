Screen protection for the iPad 3 <body> Is it true a screen guard reduces the clarity of an iPad 3 retina display? I dont want to risk scratching such an expensive investment. Any recommendations on screen protectors which satisfy the following criteria?  ol liFingerprint resistant /li liRetains the clarity of the retina display/li liAnti-glare /li liDoes not interfere with the screen sensitivity /li liDoes not interfere with swiping (you know.. that resistance you get when you swipe on plastic)/li /ol  I had a matte protector on and it did points 1,3,4 and 5 really well. But I guess that's a given with matte screens. But it scattered the light too much that I took it off. Need recommendations on clear screens which meet all the above criteria.  <answer50343> There are several companies which offers you all 5 points.   I've got a lot of experience with the Zagg Invisible Shields. They offer great quality and lifetime guarantee. But they are a bit expensive though. Quality comes at his price.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOhul.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then there is BodyGuardz. A bit cheaper, lifetime replacements as well but I don't have any experience with it. And they don't seems to offer a specific protector for the new iPad, but the protector of the iPad 2 will fit.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YypOq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer77151> Personally I really like the matte protectors, but I had to accept that they emdo/em scatter light more, and visibly alter the clarity of the screen.  That being said, I recently decided to try a "new material" that a friend told me about, and I have to say it's hands down the best non-matte screen protector I've ever tried (out of maybe a half dozen different varieties).  You can find it on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/iSmooth-iPad-Screen-Protector-Replacement/dp/B00989QKA8/  I'm not really sure what it is that's different, but somehow the material is a huge cut above the other (admittedly, cheaper) screen protectors I've tried.  Once it's on, it truly is invisible and the overall quality is way higher.  I wouldn't likely have spent this much on a screen protector (which I realize is a pretty lame reality... $600 device and I want to spend less than $5 to protect the screen??  How backwards is that??) but since a friend recommended it, I'm glad I did.  These really are, in my opinion, the best out there.  The price also appears to have dropped a bit since I bought mine, and considering the above is a 3-pack... they're about the same price as the inferior ones I've bought before.  They are not matte however, and I've written to the company requesting that they make a matte version.  If they could somehow make a matte one out of this same material, I think I'd have my 100% perfect solution, rather than the 95% perfect I have with their clear version.  Hope that helps!  <comment57710> Thanks Michiel. Do you have personal experience with the Zagg screen for the iPad 3? <comment57712> Since I don't have the new iPad, no. But I do have experience with the invisible Shield for iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPad 1 and iPad 2. They all look the same and work exactly the same. It's a pain in the ass to get them attached though. So, you should be careful with that! But they offer excellent protections! <comment83385> I have experience with the Zagg screen for iPad 3. It was excellent (although they're difficult to apply). It can take up to a week for it to become totally flat, and smooth out air bubbles, but once it does, it's invisible to the naked eye. Note: Make sure you buy the "HD" version!!! (This is completely invisible to the eye.) <comment83386> One word of warning regarding the Zagg covers; if you have a case that covers the screen, they can absorb the ink from the cover. A real pain, and nothing you can do about it. It's due to the porous material they use to protect your screen. I had to send mine back for a full refund. Shame!
