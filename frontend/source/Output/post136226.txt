Accessing virtualbox host system <body> I have VirtualBox installed on my Mac (MacOSX 10.9.3). I have downloaded a CentOS appliance. Virtual machine networking is configured as "Bridged" but the guest operating system does not receive IP address. The following screenshot shows VM network configuration (en5 is the currently active network adapter):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DACOC.png" alt="network configuration"  And here is the output of codeifconfig/code inside the guest machine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hman4.png" alt="ifconfig output"  And this is eth1 configuration on the guest:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XURMu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment161526> How is the network configured on CentOS? Is DHCP enabled? <comment161528> @Matteo: I think it's enables (see the screenshot I have added to the question)
