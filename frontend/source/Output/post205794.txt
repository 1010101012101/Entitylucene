Separate download of Photos App for Yosemite <body> I accidentally deleted the Yosemite's Photos App from my Applications folder but I can't seem to find a separate download link anywhere.  It can't possibly be that I have to re-install Yosemite just to get the app, can it?  <answer205798> If you use Time Machine, just restore the app (and its data, if applicable) from an older backup. If not, reinstalling OS X is probably the best idea, as Photos is not available on the Mac App Store and I strongemdefinitely/em/strong wouldn't try to download it elsewhere (so strongdon't/strong just type "Mac Photos.app installer" in Bing or Yahoo or Dutch and download whatever comes up). You could copy the app over from a friend or family member, though, if you wish.  <comment248160> Thanks for the answer :) That's what I thought.  I'm not really sure why Apple would prevent people from downloading the Photos app from the App store if you already have Yosemite installed, but nonetheless. <comment248162> @dkugappi You're welcome. I'd imagine that Apple doesn't have it available on the App Store because it's a system application and it makes pushing updates to them easier for Apple.
