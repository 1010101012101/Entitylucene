Change to QuickTime player in Mavericks? <body> It appears Apple has changed the QuickTime player in Mavericks. You can no longer extract music from a video. Previously you could run a video and when you saved, it gave you an option for audio only. This seems to have disappeared. Anyone have a solution?  <answer106617> The option to export the audio only has been moved to strongFile/strong → strongExport/strong → strongAudio Only…/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JXSiZ.png" alt="enter image description here"
