How to get 4 external monitors to work a macbook pro (late 2013)? <body> I'm wondering whether or not having 4 external monitors on a Macbook Pro is possible? I know that Apple states that the limit is 2. But as seen on The Verge and Cnet it's possible to go further. On both links I see that the Macbook Pro is also displaying it's own screen.   strongSo my question is, if that were to be turned off (lid shut), would I be able to drive another monitor?/strong (In total, four 27" 1920x1080 monitors)  <answer123387> With a Retina (as stated in the tag) you can use both displayports to hook a normal (non Apple) external display. This makes two. If you want more, you can use USB display adapters.  Similar questions have come along quite frequently.
