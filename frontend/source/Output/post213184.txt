El Capitan Mail 9.1: Disable remote content loading for junk mail only <body> Is there a way to disable the remote content loading only for messages marked as junk? I am aware that I can disable for all messages via Preferences, however I always want to show remote content on non-junk messages.  <answer213394> First, make sure Mail's junk mail filtering is enabled in Mail preferences under Junk Mail.  Messages marked as "Junk" in Mail (orange-tinted, with the img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tc3aZ.png" width="16" title="junk flag" / icon) will automatically not display remote content, even if "Load remote content in messages" is turned on in Mail preferences! If Mail automatically detected a message to be junk, the following banner will be displayed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7hIXQ.png" alt="junk 1"  However, if a message arrives that Mail doesn't think is Junk, this leaves you with a problem: if you view the message to mark it as junk, the remote content will be loaded. To mark a message as junk without loading it, right-click it in the message list and click Mark  As Junk Mail.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lYrAs.png" alt="mark as junk"  Now if you view it, it will show this banner instead of loading remote content:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XqVc7.png" alt="junk 2"  <comment257900> Awesome, thanks!
