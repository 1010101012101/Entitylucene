Apple Mail opens new window when I press reply? <body> Apple Main (macOS Sierra)  The problem: Mail opens new window when I press reply.  How do I prevent Mail from opening a new window for reply? It's driving me insane.  <comment356115> What behavior would you expect instead? <comment356291> @Phong ... I want to hit reply (or reply all) and Apple Mail to allow me to insert directly in the same window (where I am reading) and the bottom of what I just read (or top, depending on one's *choice*) my brief reply and on choice allow me to open it on its own separate Mail window. do you know how I can tweak the preferences so I do that? A brief google search yielded inadequate answers.
