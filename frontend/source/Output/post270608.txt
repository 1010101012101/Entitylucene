How to see public IP address of outgoing internet traffic when connected via router? <body> There is this codenettop/code tool which shows the IP address but it doesn't show the public IP address when the Mac is connected via router - it shows the same address as we can see using System Preferences' Network option. Does anyone know how to see the public IP address of outgoing internet traffic leaving my computer?  <answer270617> You can pick one of the many external services who parrot your public IP address back to you when you query them. For example,  precodecurl -s http://ipecho.net/plain; echo /code/pre  I personally use it often enough so I wrap it in a shell function called codemyip/code, inspired by a shell function from the Bash-it library:  precodefunction myip() {     res=$(curl -s http://ipecho.net/plain; echo)     echo -e "Your public IP is: ${echo_bold_green} $res ${echo_normal}" } /code/pre  strongUpdate:/strong I edited the answer to use codecurl/code instead of codewget/code because the latter does not come with macOS (thanks to user klanomath for pointing this out.)  <answer270618> We (at work and while troubleshooting family/friends) always go to http://myipaddress.com in a web browser.  As Synoli stated, there are dozens of sites out there that show you the IP address the world sees when you browse and perform other tasks.  You may find that some ISP's, especially mobile network operators like AT&amp;T, Verizon, etc. proxy everything behind a pool of IP addresses, and very often web traffic goes through a different set of proxies than everything else.  If your network is IPv6 capable, that could complicate things, with some providers doing 6to4, carrier-grade NAT, and others passing IPv6 straight through.  <answer270738> Finally, I found the solution what I was looking for: codenettop -L 0 &gt; test.csv/code This will take infinite logs and store in test.csv file for all the applications sending/receiving traffic over network. Note that some applications when set to use proxy can use different IP address. (This is to falsify one of the comments posted here which says all the applications use the same IP address).   <comment340121> wget is no standard executable in OS X/macOS. So better use `curl -s ...` instead of `wget -qO- ...`. <comment340147> @klanomath Thanks for the pointer. I have updated my answer accordingly. <comment340165> Looks like you missed my point. My purpose is not to "know" my public IP address but to see which programs on my computer are "projecting" me in front of outside world and by which address . I am looking for something which will show me a list of programs sending traffic over internet from my computer with the public IP address they are showing to the world. <comment340166> Looks like you missed my point.

If you want a list of programs communication outside, you should check your firewall logs. <comment340182> @happy_coder Programs on your computer typically don’t know your public IP address. (This is because it’s not the programs on your computer that project you to the outside world; your router does it by means of IP masquerading and NAT.) In other words, there is no list with the properties you’re looking for. Even if there was, the IP address shown would in that case be the same one as ipecho.net would give you. <comment340348> My answer addresses your question: "Does anyone know how to see the public IP address of outgoing internet traffic leaving my computer?" ---  It looks like you found the solution to your real (unasked) question, and your own added caveats that weren't addressed in the first question. <comment340504> @SirBryan Imagine a case when someone is using a proxy in an application (e.g. a torrent client). Obviously, the public IP address will be different for the traffic generated by that application than other applications. So your answer assumes that my question was a simple query which anyone could find an answer to by doing a simple Google search or by just typing "My IP address" on Google! (Google gives you your IP address when you type that and you don't even need to visit the website you mentioned!!) <comment340637> Your original question was pretty straightforward.  Of course the answers are going to be simplistic, because you didn't provide this level of detail to begin with.  You cannot expect responders to assume more than what you provide.
