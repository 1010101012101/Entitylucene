How do I stop sites downloading malicious Flash.dmg <body> I keep getting fake prompts to update and install Flash. I ignore them but its incredibly frustrating. I got them to stop for a while but now they're back.  I've already reinstalled all of my browsers and deactivated Flash in them. That was helping until recently.  Here's a screenshot, the embedded page changes, sometimes it doesn't even say one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zqb3h.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I know these are viruses so have never actually installed any just delete it but they just keep coming. I found something dubbed Flashback Malware, https://www.cnet.com/how-to/mac-flashback-malware-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-rid-of-it-faq/ - tried the three terminal commands it suggests and all came back negative.  Does anyone know what's going on and how I can remedy it?  <comment349708> Can't stop the Internet. <comment349810> @haykam how is that at all constructive? <comment349853> It's saying "it's the Internet, fix it client-side via AdBlock, popup blocking, or other tools, or deal with it, because the page is doing this for you." <comment349864> @haykam that's a pretty legitimate website. I've had this happen on National Geographic, Wall Street Journal, ESPN, Ebay, Amazon, even happened on Facebook once. Never Google yet for what that's worth. I really don't think its the site serving it up. <comment349867> Ryan, if you're getting the malicious downloads on ALL of those sites, I'm willing to bet you have a virus or malicious extension on your browser. Try clearing your browser's cache and running an antivirus software on your computer. <comment349868> @NoahL I did clear cache and cookies and even reinstalled Chrome. If you know of something more to try than please leave it as an answer and I'll GLADLY try it! Getting real frustrated <comment349869> Have you run a systemwide antivirus or tried using macOS's builtin Firewall (system pref  security & privacy)?
