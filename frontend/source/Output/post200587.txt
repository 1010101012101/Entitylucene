MacBook that spontaneously restarts and often shuts down instead of sleeping <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSA3e.png" alt="enter image description here"  My Macbook Pro has started shutting down rather than sleeping when I close it and it just decides to shut down in the middle of an operation and restart. When I ran Repair Disk Permissions on Disk Utility this is the result.  Any ideas?  <answer200590> I would go for my 'make sure it's all OK' recipe for starters...  ul liFix permissions em[which you did already]/em, Verify &amp; if necessary Repair disk, using Disk Utility/li liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLs using OnyX  - Maintenance tab/permissions, tick the box at the top then Execute./li liUpdate or [re-apply if already updated] to 10.10.5 using the 10.10.5 combo update, not the delta from App Store/li /ul
