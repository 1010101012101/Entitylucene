Running Windows 8.1 Pro on external hard drive, how turn off fn-key lock? <body> I'm not sure if this is an Apple specific problem, but I am not able to turn on the fn-key lock. I'd like to access the fn keys without holding the fn key. I've found guides online that seem to be brand specific, e.g. the solution for Dell computers is different from Asus computers. So how can I do this with the Apple keyboard on a Macbook Pro?
