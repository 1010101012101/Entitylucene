In Bash, can I output text from cut into a new command? <body> This might be a vague title, but it's hard to explain what I'm doing in a short title.   I have a tool that removes adware and it mainly runs in bash. Some of the programs I want to kill may have multiple PIDs or output files. Here's what I have and what I want to do:  precodelsof +D /Applications/appIDontWant.app/ | cut -d " " -f 2 1&gt; /code/pre  So I have this which gets the PIDs for the application and I can then output using 1 to a text or something, but what if I want to output the PIDs to a   precodesudo kill  /code/pre  ? Would this be another time to use | ? (I'm vaguely familiar with pipe, but not great.)  Now, I do know that I can simply put   precodesudo kill appIDontWant.app  /code/pre  but that's just not any fun.  <answer162711> Assuming your command results in a number of PIDs  precodesudo kill $(lsof +D /Applications/appIDontWant.app/ | cut -d " " -f 2) /code/pre  should do the trick.
