How do I disable sending or receiving "effects" in iOS 10.1 Messages? <body> For reasons past comprehension, the new iOS 10 Messages app allows applying "effects" to messages. It used to be possible to disable the ability to generate or receive these abominations by choosing     Settings  General  Accessibility  Reduce Motion   but since 10.1, this now appears to be impossible.  How do I disable sending or receiving "effects" in iOS 10.1 Messages?  <answer258624> Apple added a new setting to disable playing message effects.  Go to codeSettings -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Reduce Motion/code and turn off codeAuto-play Message Effects/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d8RCK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment323347> I tried that but still get the options to send them every time. <comment323353> Apple removed the previous method to reduce/remove Message effects and this is what the put in place.  I'm not aware of any other, non-jailbreak, method. <comment323376> So no there's no way to prevent sending them? <comment323378> Yes, just don't do it. <comment323388> @tubedogg: The connotation of "prevent" is generally to stop someone from doing something and is distinct from simply not doing it. <comment323395> No, there's no way currently published by Apple or others that would prevent someone from sending them.
