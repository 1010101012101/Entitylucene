No .bash_profile in OS X Lion? <body> I just did a clean install of OS X Lion and I see that now I have no .bash_profile file in my home directory.  Should I create this by hand? (I want to save in it some alias.)  Thank you.  PS : The only file that exist now that I could use is /etc/profile  <answer26929> By default this file does not exist on any version of OS X. And yes, it is up to you to create it manually:  codetouch ~/.bash_profile/code  Alternatively, you could use nano as well if you want to edit the file at the same time:  codenano ~/.bash_profile/code  Do not monkey in code/etc/code unless you know what you're doing.   <comment30786> Thank you for your answer.I just created the file and it worked fine after opening a new terminal window <comment30787> You are welcome. If it solved your problem, please mark it as such to let others know if they ever reference this thread :) <comment63884> Thanks - this had been bugging me for a while <comment121530> Is there a reference in the OSX documentation for this? <comment121566> @b.long I haven't see one. Not that I scoured it, but Apple doesn't tend to publicize UNIX config files. They tend to focus on making their OSes as less scary as possible. But since OS X is fully UNIX 3.0 compliant, anything that works in Linux works here. You can simply google "bash_profile" or "bashrc" (here's a good primer on the difference between the two: http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html). <comment122350> Good to know & thanks again :)
