How to sync iPhone photo albums to iPhoto <body> I'm using iPhone4 and the latest iOS. I've created albums and categorized my photos into the albums.  Question is, how can I then sync the photos WITH the albums into iPhoto?  <answer73730> That is a good question! The answer, as far as I can tell, is: You can't!  The whole system of syncing the Photos app and iPhoto among your devices, and between each other, seems to be a work in progress. I could go on about all the issues, but the short answer is, you can't do it right now.  <comment85600> This question has come up before, unfortunately there isn't a way to do this currently.
