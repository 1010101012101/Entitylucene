How to restart Bluetooth service from command line <body> On Linux, if one wishes to restart the Bluetooth service, they simply launch a terminal and issue the following command:  precodesudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart /code/pre  What is the equivalent on Mac OS X?  I would like to restart my Bluetooth without having to restart the entire computer.  I am using codeYosemite/code.  Update:  Of the various command line options provided by Testing below the only one that seemed to work was the last, which is this:  precodesudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport sudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport /code/pre  Update 2: The above command no longer works and I wonder if it ever did.  The first time I tried it it might have been something else that restarted my bluetooth services.  The only thing that will work for me is a restart of the entire machine every morning.  <answer251853> On El Capitan, it's kind of tricky because it doesn't allow you to unload system services. However, a brute-force method is:br codesudo pkill blued/codebr 'blued' is the OS X bluetooth daemon, and it will automatically restart when terminated (at least when I tested it on my El Capitan machine). Other related daemons are: com.apple.bluetoothReporter, com.apple.IOBluetoothUSBDFU, and com.apple.bluetoothaudiod (you can look at the daemons running using codesudo launchctl list/code)  You can also try: code sudo launchctl stop com.apple.blued sudo launchctl start com.apple.blued /code  If you have an older OS X version, it's cleaner: code sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist /code or  code sudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport sudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport /code  <answer271921> Found this page on GitHub Gist with commands that worked for me (I am running Yosemite v. 10.10.5). You can simply type the following in the terminal to restart the bluetooth daemon without restarting:  precodesudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport  sudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport  /code/pre  bluetooth daemon  <answer273685> I am running Yosemite v10.10.5 and none of the other comments / gists worked for me at all. The only steps that I managed to figure out to take back to life the bluetooth driver was:  ol liExecute sudo codekextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport/code in the terminal/li liRestart computer without conserving the opened windows/li /ol  <comment313130> Which version of OS X? It appears it may matter in this case. <comment313134> If installing another app is an option, you might check out this gist: https://gist.github.com/ralph-hm/a65840c4f5e439b90170d735a89a863f <comment313182> I tried all three of the commands you suggested and none of them would kill and/or restart bluetooth.  I say this because I was still able to use my bluetooth mouse and keyboard after issuing the 'kill' version of each of the commands.  Any other ideas?  I am on Yosemite at the moment. <comment313526> @zeeple: you are right. All the command provided by @Testing will cause an automatic restart of killed daemons because they are configured in this way by `launchd` (which command interface is `launchctl`). <comment313529> Excellent question. Still investing the point. I think there is a clean way on `Mavericks` and `Yosemite`. <comment314033> This morning none of these commands are working to get my bluetooth working again.  The only thing that would work was a reboot of the OS. <comment314064> On El Capitan the `sudo launchctl stop com.apple.blued` command does indeed auto-restart the daemon without the start command. The older commands don't do anything on El Capitan so unfortunately I don't have much more insight (I upgraded my last Yosemite machine just a couple weeks ago). <comment319044> Sadly, I work for a giant company with a backwards IT dept.  They will not allow upgrading to anything beyond Yosemite.  None of the commands above work for me at all.  Restarting the entire machine every morning is the only thing that will work. <comment341773> kextunload & load worked for me on Yosemite <comment344108> For me, simply restarting the computer does the trick.  What I am looking for is a command line way to do it without having to restart the entire machine. <comment358954> 'sudo pkill blued' did not work for me on El Capitan. <comment358988> I removed the com.apple.Bluetooth.plist from /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/ or /Library/Preferences/ and restarted  fixed. the terminal commands below did not work for me - but of course you can make a terminal command that removes this file and then restarts your mac :)
