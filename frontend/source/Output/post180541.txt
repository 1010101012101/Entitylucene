Move Bootcamp to external drive - restored, fdisk - still not recognized as bootable! <body> strongI want to copy my W7 Bootcamp partition to an external HDD, and be bootable of course. It is currently functioning fine alongside Yosemite on a different HDD./strong  DiskUtility Restore works... I marked the partition as active... But the new Bootcamp partition is still not recognized on start-up.  Please help!  Details:  ol liCurrently using (and working from) Yosemite OSX10.10.2 on an internal SSD./li liSource: HDD1 (external-USB) works fine and can boot as W7 or Yosemite. This is the original Bootcamp partition I want to clone or copy./li liDestination: HDD2 (external-USB) is blank and much larger than the HDD1 Bootcamp partition. This is the drive I'd like to copy my Bootcamp partition to and have it bootable./li liThe HDD1 Bootcamp partition was origninally made with OSX10.6.8./li /ol  I have tried:  ol liFormatting HDD2 as GUID-FAT32; using DiskUtility to 'restore' the HDD1 bootcamp partition to; using sudo fdisk to mark as active; everything seemed to go great but it doesnt get recognized upon boot-up./li liSame as above but formatting HDD2 as MBR-FAT32. /li liRunning disk repair after step 1, looks good./li /ol  My fdisk commands: sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk1; p; setpid 1; 07; flag 1; p; write; y ...seems to work. See attached image.  strongWhat am I missing???/strong  Thanks in advance. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aumtL.png" alt="fdisk commands"  <answer181828> Windows 7 will not run from an external USB hard drive.  This is a limitation of Windows, not your Mac.  Windows can ONLY run from an internal, non-removable hard drive.  That limitation applies even on a real PC.  <answer182671> Thank you both for your replies, they helped my investigation. (David Anderson and Wes Sayweed)  There are many reports of both W7 and W8 running bootable from an external drive. I hoped that with the proper disk setup, activation, and EFI settings I could accomplish this, but I have discovered the barrier: you need a usb3 or thunderbolt connection, it cannot be done with usb2 by a limitation of windows itself.  BTW, W8.1 officially includes support for booting from an external drive. Running W7 that way appears to require a couple extra steps.  <comment214482> You have no code in the MBR on disk1. You can confirm this by entering the command `sudo  dd  if=/dev/disk1  count=1  bs=446  |  xxd`. A result of all zeros would indicate a problem. What is the Model/Year of your Mac? I also assume you disconnected the original external disk before trying to boot to the new external disk. Finally, I am surprised you have been able  to boot Windows on an external disk. I thought that was not possible.
