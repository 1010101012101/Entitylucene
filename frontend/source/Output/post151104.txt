Automatically Trigger Automator through mail <body> I want to trigger a workflow in automator every time I receive a new email in "mail.app". How can this be done?  <answer151123> Yes it can:  You can use the normal Mail rules with a perform action: Run Applescript.  Create a normal  Mail rule applescript. But include code to call your automator workflow via the unix command /usr/bin/automator.  The strong/usr/bin/automator/strong command will run the workflow you point it at and optionally can pass input  onto the workflow using the -i option.  Here is a quick example of a Applescript Mail rule which gets the subject of the email/s and runs a automator workflow that speaks any text passed on to it. In this case the email subject.  The script MUST be saved in: your code~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/code  folder for mail.app to see them.     You can attach a script to a Mail rule. For example, you could have an   incoming message trigger a script that copies information from the   message and pastes it into a database that works with AppleScript.      Choose Mail  Preferences, then click Rules. Add a rule or select an   existing rule to edit.      Choose Run AppleScript from the “Perform the   following actions” pop-up menu.      Choose a script from the pop-up menu   of scripts that are located in ~/Library/Application   Scripts/com.apple.mail.      Or choose “Open in Finder” to open the folder   so you can copy a script into the folder first.      If you later move or rename the   script, your rule will not work.      Click OK to save the rule.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZaWBi.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  The example Applescript for the Rule  (Change the  strongworkFlowPath/strong property to reflect the full path to your Automator workflow file)    precodeproperty workFlowPath : quoted form of ("/Users/YourUserName/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/mailSpeakTest.workflow") --CHANGE THIS TO YOUR FULL WORKFLOW FILE PATH example  "/Users/joeblogs/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/mailSpeakTest.workflow"       using terms from application "Mail"         on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule theRule             repeat with eachMessage in theMessages                 (*Get the email Subject *)                 set input_Argument to subject of eachMessage                 (*Run subroutine for workflow *)                 my runAutomator(input_Argument)             end repeat         end perform mail action with messages     end using terms from      (*Workflow  Subroutine *)     on runAutomator(input_Argument)          (*Path to workflow *)           (*Setup and Run the unix command *)         set command to "/usr/bin/automator   -i " &amp; quoted form of input_Argument &amp; space &amp; workFlowPath         do shell script command     end runAutomator /code/pre  The Automator workflow is simply  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zUG7f.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment177809> Probably best done with a folder action. <comment177966> @mehmenmike What is a folder action? Can you elaborate? <comment177971> I have done all the steps that you have done above but was not able to get any result. Now, the path that you mentioned "/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/mailSpeakTest.workflow" does not exist in my OS X Mavericks. I went with the closest path "/Library/Scripts/Mail Scripts" and saved my script there. Also, is it required that I save my workflow file there too? Also just to clarify, will this script automatically start my workflow every time I receive an email in my Mail app without my notice as that is exactly what I want to achieve. Thanks in Advance @markhunte <comment177976> Read the first couple of paragraphs [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/reference/ASLR_folder_actions.html) <comment177977> @kevin You just need to change USERNAME to your username. And mailSpeakTest.workflow to what ever you name your workflow, You can save your workflow anywhere. I just did it there for convineance of being with the applescript file. And yes mail rules run as long as mail is running. <comment177995> This is NOT best done with folder Actions. Maybe @mehmenmike can explain why they think that is the case?? <comment177997> @kevin i have update the code for clarity and also the post <comment178032> Thank you!! This really made my day. Thanks for the clear explanation. @markhunte
