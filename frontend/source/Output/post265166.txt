El Capitan, how to choose a specific Java version to run <body> I'm running El Capitan and codejava -version/code produces the following:  precodejava version "1.8.0_101" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode) /code/pre  I'm having severe slowdown problems with the h2 database console, so I want to see if going back to Java 1.6 has any effect.  I run the Java Preferences application and move 1.6 so it's at the top, but the next time I launch Java Preferences 1.8 is back up there!  Even unchecking 1.8 doesn't persist -- it's rechecked on the next launch.  How does one go about selecting a particular Java version these days?  <answer265189> Maybe just put the following in your code~/.bashrc/code:  precodeexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6` /code/pre  <comment332498> Thanks...so what would I do after the test, to get back to normal (1.8)?  The last time I messed with my path variables I had to do a complete system restore so I'm a little anxious :-) <comment332509> To get back to 1.8 you could just type `export JAVA_HOME=\`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6\`` from the command line (and remove the `export JAVA_HOME=\`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6\`` from your `~/.bashrc` <comment332605> Awesome, thank you so much.  Test completed and useful results obtained.  Many thanks :-)
