Mail - Subfolders on own IMAP-Server are all shown under INBOX <body> I've got a problem with my folders within the mail app. As you can see, I've got three accounts:  ul lian exchange server/li limy iCloud server/li lian own imap server/li /ul  The problem with the IMAP server is, that all of the subfolders are shown under the INBOX and I can't move them to the server-root, because, as you can see down further I have no possibility to move them to the root.  I'm not quite sure wether this is the correct community for this question.. but, would love to hear some tips :)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HmmP.png" width="278" title="IMAP folder problem"  <answer207030> You can try adding a root folder in Accounts under the Advanced tab.
