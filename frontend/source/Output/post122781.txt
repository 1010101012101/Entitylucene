Cant remove windows partition from mac(not BOOTCAMP) <body> I have a windows partition(not a bootcamp one) and would like to remove it.This was obviously not possible with bootcamp.I tried using Disk Utility but all buttons there are inactive. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3R7cq.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have programs like NTFS 3G,reFit installed.Any way to remove windows now?  <answer122791> One of the following three methods should work:  1) Boot into Recovery Mode and use Disk Utility from there. You should be able to modify or delete the NTFS partition on the main hard drive.  2) Boot your Mac from an external hard drive that has a bootable installation of Mac OS X on it, and run Disk Utility from there.  3) Put your Mac in Target Disk Mode and connect it via FireWire or Thunderbolt cable to another Mac. Run Disk Utility from the other Mac.  <answer122850> Try Formatting partition using below commands:  Open Terminal and run   precode$ diskutil list /code/pre  this will show the list of partitions available in your computer and then run   precode$diskutil erasedisk JHFS+ SecondPartition &lt;Partition which you want to format eg: /dev/disk2&gt; /code/pre  Where "SecondPartition" is the partition name it assigns after formatting and "JHFS+" is the partition type - Journaled HFS+ Partition   <answer137200> I've just had a simlilar issue, I solved it by following @vdr tip but it required slight mods  Open Terminal and run  precode$diskutil list /code/pre  diskutil will return somthing simliar to   /dev/disk0      precode:                       TYPE NAME                   SIZE      IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0     1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1  2:                  Apple_HFS MountainLion            64.0 GB    disk0s2 3:       Microsoft Basic Data                         31.8 GB    disk0s3 4: 21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-656564454649               1.0 MB     disk0s4 5: 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4               14.7 GB    disk0s5 6:                 Linux Swap                         17.2 GB    disk0s6 /code/pre  /dev/disk1...
