Is It Possible To Still Upgrade To OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion? <body> For those Mac owners still on OS X Snow Leopard, does the possibility exist to upgrade to OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion rather than to 10.9 Mavericks?  <answer106286> I have some good news for you. Every Mac running Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) or later will be able to upgrade for free to Mavericks.br Check the specs page on Apple.com  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqQzQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  But if you want to upgrade specific to Mountain Lion (can't think of a reason why?), the answer is no I'm afraid. Every time Apple releases a new OS, they drop support for the older ones.  You can always look on eBay or other second-hand sites to obtain a legal copy of the disk.  strongEDIT: Apple offers to buy both Lion and Mountain Lion in the online Store! Issue solved :)/strong  <answer106768> strongYes, Apple sells older OS as redeemable downloads from the web store./strong  Apple sells OS X Mountain Lion redemption codes, alongside OS X Lion, for Â£14 each on the UK store.   The US store link is below and it appears the part number is the same no matter which store you select:  ul lihttp://store.apple.com/us/product/D6377Z/A/os-x-mountain-lion/li lihttp://store.apple.com/us/product/D6106Z/A/os-x-lion/li /ul
