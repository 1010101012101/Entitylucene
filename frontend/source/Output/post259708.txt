Cannot Erase SSD with Disk Utility in Recovery Mode <body> In the process of trying to remove a bootcamp partition I got myself into a situation where I have two erased OSX Extended (Journaled) partitions that cannot be partitioned back together or removed completely by erasing the SSD.  The only HD I can boot into now is the Recovery HD and Disk Utility does not allow me to erase the SSD so that I can recover from a time machine backup.  How can I find my way out of this?  <comment324942> You can't wipe the drive you're booted from, of course, but you ought to be able to remove & replace/format individual partitions. Failing that, use Internet Recovery instead of local. <comment324947> How can I use the Internet Recovery? I don't see that option when I boot up holding the option key. <comment324949> Have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/136590/how-can-i-delete-a-partition-corestorage-logical-volume-from-the-terminal  . I've been in a simlar situation and had to manually remove the Core Storage volumes. <comment324970> Internet recovery is Command + Option + R <comment325161> @NoahL using internet recovery and a bootable osx USB I was able to solve my issue. Thanks
