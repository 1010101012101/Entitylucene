New file on right-click, on Finder (like Windows Explorer) <body> On Windows Explorer file manager I can create a new file via right-click menu option.  I would like the same functionality on Mac/Finder. Is it possible?  <comment324122> In order to help you get a useful answer, you really need to provide more details. As a minimum, the version of macOS you're running is a must - otherwise how will the community know if their answer is relevant to you? Also, in terms of the actual functionality you want, is there a particular file type you want to be able to create via the context menu (i.e. the right-click menu)?
