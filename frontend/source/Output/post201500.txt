How can I make my finder refresh a NAS volume mounted using AFP? <body> Regrettably I'm using a WD EX2 on my bridged home network (current and 4th gen Airport Extremes), and the finder doesn't refresh my AFP volumes. The NAS is attached on the 4th gen APE.  Anyone have a solution? I've been relaunching the finder and/or connecting/disconnecting. I'm using 10.10.5 on a late 2012 mac mini. Thank you.  <answer201604> I'm going to throw this out here as a workaround if you can't find a better solution.  Many years ago I had a similar situation and this was an issue with the version of strongMac OS X/strong at the time and strongNetwork Drives/strong and the lack of a strongRefresh/strong command in strongFinder/strong, which it still doesn't have.  My workaround solution then was an strongAppleScript/strong that I saved as an application and put it in the strongFinder Toolbar/strong.  You could even use it in an strongAutomator Service/strong in strongFinder/strong and also assign a emkeyboard shortcut/em to it if you want.  What this strongAppleScript/strong does is creates a hidden file named ".refresh.tmp" and then deletes it, causing the strongFinder/strong window to refresh/update.  strongMy Refresh Finder AppleScript Code:/strong  precodetell application "Finder"     try         delete (make new file at (front window) with properties {name:".refresh.tmp"})     end try end tell /code/pre  I'm also including some strongAppleScript/strong code I found on strongStackOverflow/strong and has been posted on strongAskDifferent/strong as well although I believe it originated on strongStackOverflow/strong. Not that any of that really matters other then to give credit to someone other then me for it as I didn't write the code below.  It causes all strongFinder/strong windows to refresh by toggling the strongView/strong state between strongIcons/strong and strongList/strong views.  I use both, because when I have lots of strongFinder/strong windows open I prefer to use my original solution on the strongFinder Toolbar/strong, creating/deleting the hidden file, as it's much quicker and usually at that point my focus is on a single strongFinder/strong window.  I have the strongAutomator Service/strong set to use a emkeyboard shortcut/em and the emscript/em I found on strongStackOverflow/strong. Obviously you're free to choose how to use or not any of what's provided here.  strongRefresh Finder AppleScript Code/strong found at: Automator Command to Refresh ALL Finder/all Finder Windows  precodetell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every Finder window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view          end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Either one of these strongAppleScripts/strong can be saved as an strongAppleScript Application/strong and or an strongAutomator Service/strong, the latter of which a emkeyboard shortcut/em can be assigned.  Also, as I do not like the generic icon assigned to either, I added a custom em.icns/em file from the Internet, in this case a refresh symbol. (A em.png/em file can be used as well.)  h2strongCreating the Refresh Finder AppleScript Application/strong/h2  ol liOpen strongScript Editor/strong (or strongAppleScript Editor/strong if applicable)./li liCopy and paste either of the emscripts/em, from above, into the strongUntitled/strong document window and then press strongCompile/strong./li liPress kbd⌘/kbdkbdS/kbd to save and set the strongFile Format:/strong to strongApplication/strong saving it in the strongApplications/strong folder as strongRefresh Finder/strong./li liGive the strongRefresh Finder/strong application bundle a custom icon.
