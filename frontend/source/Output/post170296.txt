Can I fix DNS issues on MBP for good? <body> I noticed DNS issue on my MBP where all of sudden (in the middle of my work, nothing changed) my DNS simply stops working. It's easy to notice that, so I do the following:  ul lifirst I check if DNS is really broken by eg pinging google.com, when DNS is not working, ping is not working either/li lithen I execute the script with following commands:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist /code/pre/li /ul  This is all happening on MBP 2013 with Yosemite installed, sometimes more often, sometimes less.  Is there a way to fix DNS issues in more better, systematic, way; so I dont have to manually fix it by myself?

I just go to terminal, as explained, and ping eg. `google.com`. If ping is not working, than I know my DNS broke again. <comment200180> Hmm if the dns outage happens again just open /Utilities/Console click Show Log List if the list pane is hidden and choose 'System Log Queries' - 'All Messages'. Now check/compare the point of time of the outage with the time stamps and/or look/search (search field: right upper corner) for messages containing 'dns' or 'discoveryd'. Copy and paste the result and add it to your question. <comment200181> ok, will do that next time when this happens. <comment200183> Nope, this one happens in the middle of working, so no waking up or anything like that (my 2nd problem is seriously affecting my the _other_ computer;) <comment200207> Ive updated the message with the log <comment200216> Have you updated to 10.10.2? It may solve your issue. In any case, you're not alone (see http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/01/why-dns-in-os-x-10-10-is-broken-and-what-you-can-do-to-fix-it/) <comment200219> Im on 10.10.2. Yeah, I know I am not the only one :))) would like to see if someone fixed this in a better way :) Thank you!
