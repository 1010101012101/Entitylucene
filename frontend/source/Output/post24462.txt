Auto join personal hotspot <body> I recently bought an iPad2 (WIFI only) in addition to my iPhone 4 I already had. There are two reason I took the wifi only model:  ol liI am not planning on taking the iPad everywhere I go. That's what the iPhone is for./li liI have an unlimited data plan with free tethering on the iPhone. If I ever need Internet on the go, I just make a personal hotspot and use the iPhone's connection on the iPad./li /ol  However, in order to join that hotspot, I need to first take the iPhone, go to settings and emthen/em I can join the hotspot with my iPad. I guess it's a nice security compromise, however it is still a real pain if I use the iPad 2-3 times per hour over the day at work and have to go to the iPhone's settings every time. This also happens if my GF's iPhone 3G wants to connect to my hotspot (she has no data plan).  Is there a way to allow certain devices to join the hotspot at a moment's notice, without taking out the iPhone itself?  <answer55860> If you connect to the iPhone not via wifi but via bluetooth, there is no need to do anything on the iPhone, just establish the connection using the iPad's bluetooth settings. Of course, bluetooth on the iPhone must then remain always switched on. I do this all the time, the iphons remains in the pocket ...   <answer103847> no there isnt but yes it is a good security compromise.  <comment34443> Exactly what I want to know <comment60267> I THINK apple makes it this way so iPhone can save battery: as soon as you disconnect from the hotspot, it "turns off" wi-fi. So every time you want to connect again you have to click there so you can turn on again. <comment122256> Might you elaborate on how this is a security compromise? <comment169098> I don't see how this is a security compromise given that the personal hotspot network uses WPA2 and is basically unbreakable other than by brute forcing, but that would take an insane amount of time.
