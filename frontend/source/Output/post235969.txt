One line weather output from terminal <body> Anyone knows a way to get a one line weather output in the terminal window with specified location?  So far I'm using curl wttr.in/city but I would like a one output like City, Sunny 0'.  I've found something like this (first answer): https://askubuntu.com/questions/390329/weather-from-terminal  Unfortunately it does not work. I've installed wget command with brew and tried running those three lines from .sh file.  <answer236638> Simplest solution is codeansiweather/code which you can install with codebrew/code. The result looks like img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kR0ZA.png" alt="ansiweather result".  If you want to write you own command/function it's not that difficult. If the output from the online location is in json, or something similar. You can use codejq/code to parse json, and only print what you need.  precodecurl -s http://ip-api.com/json | jq -Cr . /code/pre  Read the manual page of codejq/code to learn how to use it.  I tried the API you're using above, that's not gonna help your case. Find some other one that replies in JSON. For example:  precodecurl -s 'api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={CITY,COUNTRY_CODE}&amp;APPID={GET_YOUR_API_KEY}' | jq -C '.name? .weather?.main?' /code/pre  I haven't tested it personally, because you have to make an account to make a call, but you get the idea.  Comment if you get lost.  <comment288661> Are you struggling to pick out the results from a correct download or are you needing help identifying a source to download? Why not edit this to show the exact site you've chosen to run from `curl` or `wget` if you just need help with `awk` or `cut` to strip out the parts you don't want to see. <comment288895> This question doesn't seem related to OS X or Apple products in general. <comment291680> Yes! Thank you. <comment292535> thanks for the tip, I'm new here :)
