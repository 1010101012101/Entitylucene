Sites blocked in /etc/hosts often doesn't work <body> I'm using a Macbook Pro as a productivity/work machine and have Facebook and reddit blocked with code/etc/hosts/code:  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost  fe80::1%lo0     localhost 0.0.0.0         facebook.com ::0             facebook.com 0.0.0.0         reddit.com ::0             reddit.com /code/pre  This has worked for a while in all browsers, but recently stopped working in Firefox and Safari, and I can't figure out why. I was previously using 127.0.0.1, but when that stopped working I tried 0.0.0.0 instead, no dice.  I did install Avast just recently so I thought that could have been the problem, what with its web security features, but I uninstalled the browser add-on in Safari and Firefox and I was still able to access Facebook and reddit just fine.  And I just tried uninstalling the add-ons again, and restarted the computer. Now, Google Chrome can access Facebook, but not reddit. Firefox can't access either, and Safari can access both...  I'm using OS X 10.7.5.  <answer103037> The following site clearly explains how to block a site step by step using hosts on etc by means of terminal:  wikiHow-Block a Website on Mac  <answer103432> I solved my problem. It seems I need to block both the domain website.com and the address www.website.com. I didn't know that was necessary. I edited them in there and now the blocking is consistently working everywhere.  <comment120759> You could post your answer below and accept it. That would help others a) who may face similar issues, b) avoid answering this question. <comment121273> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment121275> This site definitively works better if you post answers as answers and do not include them into the question. I've edited your question accordingly, please add the answer below yourself. <comment121732> I wasn't allowed to post an answer since my account was too new.
