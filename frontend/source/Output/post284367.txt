Privacy for my photos <body> I have some photos on my iPhone that I’d like to keep private. I searched on the App Store but I don’t know which of these applications are very safe for my privacy.  Do you know if there is a safe app that works like a strongbox for my photos?  <comment358610> If you're just after an app to store photos in, then there are thousands that require a password and/or Touch ID to unlock them first before being able to access your files (e.g. photos, etc). If you're after something else, then you need to clarify what you mean by applications that _are very safe for my privacy_? <comment358640> Your iPhone itself is a strongbox. Did you hear how much trouble the FBI had to go to to get into one?... & that was only iOS 7. <comment358696> If it's not too many photos, you can put them in an encrypted Note with a password different than your phone login password.
