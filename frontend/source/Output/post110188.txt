How do I find songs in my iTunes library that aren’t associated with my Apple ID? <body> I get messages when syncing my iPod that tell me that a song cannot be copied because I am not authorised to play them.  Is there a quick way to find all songs that are like this and delete them?  <answer110217> First, why not authorise your computer? strongStore/strong → strongAuthorise This Computer…/strong and log in.  Whilst you can't distinguish between songs for an authorised Apple ID and an unauthorised Apple ID, you can create a smart playlist that shows Purchased songs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YbQ41.png"  <comment129847> You can make a Smart Playlist that just finds Purchased items, and then there’s a field called “iCloud Status” – perhaps you could find them by filtering with that field? <comment129914> Is this the best method? Unfortunately the songs in question had been authorised by a friend of mine with another apple id and i have quite a number of songs in my library (2118) that have been purchased through the itunes store. I am only trying to find about 13 songs out of that total number so even with the cut down numbers it will take me quite some time. <comment165129> Sorting by date added, genre, Year, etc. can help reduce the search further.
