How can I copy 10GB files onto a 64GB USB drive? <body> I have Virtual machine images  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUSfX.png" alt="enter image description here"  that I wanted to back up on a USB Drive so I bought a PNY64GB Drive  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Ve9K.png" alt="enter image description here"  which was big enough for the IE8 3.36GB pvm file as seen in details  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qdQan.png" alt="enter image description here"  However when I try to add any of the othe other .pvm files which are 12, 11 and 14 GBs, I get  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERaQH.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fit the other .pmv's on the drive which should be big enough.  <answer216665> You need to use Disk Utility and format it as HFS+. FAT doesn't support files larger that 4GB (I think). Go to Disk Utility and select the drive. Then erase it and select the format as codeMac OS Extended (Journaled)/code. You can name it whatever you'd like.  <comment261876> You'll need to use Disk Utility and format it as HFS+.

Please include a screenshot of the format options.  I can't do that right now while the copies are stil running.
