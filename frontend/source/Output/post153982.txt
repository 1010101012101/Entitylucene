iOs Simulator ignoring Hosts file <body> I'm actually working on a website development and I configured all the needed hostname on my /etc/hosts files.  Actually in our office we use an internal DNS for the QA servers and we override requests with hostfiles because hostname must be equal in both case, anyway.  I write (server-side) on the page the IP address that is serving that page and in my iOS Simulator there's no way to show up 127.0.0.1 it always show to me the QA IP.  I read online that the entry on the hosts file must be wrote one-per-line or the Simulator will not work.  Actually I have:  precode127.0.0.1 it.domain.test.com 127.0.0.1 us.domain.test.com /code/pre  Before I had:  precode127.0.0.1 it.domain.test.com us.domain.test.com /code/pre  Side notes: My OS: OSX 10.10 Yosemite Here we are behind a proxy.  <comment181203> This might be useful, even though incomplete, Yosemite seems to no longer pay any heed to the hosts file - http://superuser.com/questions/829383/how-to-fix-etc-hosts-which-doesnt-work-in-os-x-10-10-yosemite <comment181212> Thank you @Tetsujin, that post help me figure out that there's a real problem in Yosemite, howsoever I commented on that blog post cause my browsers works good, I have troubles only with the simulator <comment181213> Glad it at least helped a bit
