How do I prevent OS X from making ".filename" files? <body> I'm not sure of the consistency but sometimes OS X makes hidden code.filename/code files where codefilename/code is a name of another file in the same directory. I want to know how to disable this since USBs I insert and copy / move files to / from keep having this and it's annoying to have to delete them every time I plug the USB onto a non-Mac computer.  <answer104037> The easiest way to handle this (with a commercial program though) seems to be to use BlueHarvest (hat tip to this answer on superuser). Note that BlueHarvest does not prevent the creation of these files. It continuously monitors non-Mac drives and cleans them up. It can also be used to manually clean up a volume/folder/file.  For other alternatives (some with limitations), see:br Is there any way to prevent a Mac from creating dot underscore files? - from superuser.combr BlueHarvest Alternatives for Mac OS X  You can also use the solution below to replace the standard codeumount/code (unmount) program with a wrapper script to clean up these files when you eject the MSDOS formatted drive:br "Automatically delete Mac OS X dot files from MS-DOS filesystems" - Feb 07, '11  <answer104118> What format is the volume in? If you mean the AppleDouble files that start with code._/code, they are not normally created on HFS volumes. They are used to store metadata like extended attributes, ACLs, and resource forks on non-HFS volumes.  You can delete the code._/code files with codefind/code:  precodefind /Volumes/volume -name ._\* -delete /code/pre  If the volume is in an HFS format, you can use codedot_clean/code to remove the code._/code files after merging the metadata stored in them with the metadata stored in native formats:  precodedot_clean /Volumes/volume /code/pre  <comment122539> Is there a system-level setting of preventing this? Because I'm pretty positive, this wasn't happening before. (Say, a year or so ago.) <comment122593> Nothing that works on all kinds of (hidden) files that Finder does not show on HFS+ volumes. Did you use HFS+ formatted drives before and then switched to MSDOS in the last year or so? <comment122606> Thanks for the tip on dot_clean! <comment123130> The volume is formatted in FAT32. <comment123131> Not really, all USBs I've used are commonly formatted in FAT32.
