Time Machine - move backup from local disk to network volume. Wrong case sensitivity? <body> I am trying to move a Time Machine backup from a Firewire disk (called codedisk1/code) directly connected to a computer to a network share, that is, from a folder in/on code/Disk1/Backup.backupdb/code to a sparsebundle/disk image (called codedmg1/code) stored in the network share.  Following some suggestions in a Time Machine FAQ I begun a new TM backup to let Time Machine create the needed disk image. As soon as the image was created I cancelled the backup.  Next step was to mount this new image (the resulting volume is called codeTime Machine Backup/code, codeTMB/code for short) and delete the code/TMB/Backups.backupdb/code directory. Finally I was supposed to copy code/disk1/Backups.backupdb/code to code/TMB//code. Unfortunately, this last step fails with an error message codeThe volume has the wrong case sensitivity for a backup/code.  Apparently codedisk1/code is not case sensitive (which was/is the default) but for some reason Time Machine sparsebundles are created case sensitive = you can't copy an old local backup (Or can you? Finder prevents it but "logically" it shouldn't be a problem to copy files from a emcase insensitive/em volume to a emcase sensitive/em volume. The other way around should, however, not work.) to the disk image that is necessary to use if you want to backup to a network volume.  This must be a pretty common usecase, especially since Apple themselves sell a simple NAS (Time Capsule) for this specific purpose, so how is such a migration supposed to be done? The only/most common advice I found when I google for solutions is to start over, but then you waste quite a bit of space as well as lose readily accessible backup history. Not good.  <answer222079> I recommend copying the data somewhere and following the instructions at the bottom of this page: http://pondini.org/TM/A8.html  Your assumption is that changing the structure around the files should leave the files intact, I think, and that's just not correct. It's like saying somehow that files can exist completely independently of the structure that supports them.. which isn't really true.  A car isn't a car anymore if you strip away the body and the transmission and some of the engine. Now, you can replace those parts with parts from another car, say, but the performance will be different. To that end maybe you could create a case sensitive partition and copy the files there, destroy the old one, re-create the old one properly and copy the files back, but I wouldn't risk it. Your data's worth more than that. You want to know without a doubt that if you need a backup, you can get it, and messing around this way might introduce doubt (as it should).  <answer263249> I think i found a very easy solution to a really hard problem (no need to re-format drives etc)  ol ligo to the TM backup/li liselect the folder that you want to copy/li licompress folder/li licompressed folder will appear on desktop/li liuncompress folder/li licopy it wherever you want/li /ol
