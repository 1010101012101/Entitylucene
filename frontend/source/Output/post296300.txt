How can I apply VoiceOver voice settings (rate, pitch, etc) to system-wide voice? <body> My sister uses Read&amp;Write Gold to assist her in using her Mac. One of the features it includes is a text-to-speech function, which highlights words as they are read out loud.  The application uses the default system voice and rate.  Under VoiceOver Utility.app  Speech  Voices, there are settings for fine-tuning rate, pitch, volume, and intonation. However, it seems that these settings only apply in VoiceOver itself, NOT in the general system voice as used by other applications. Is there a way to make the settings carry over, or to edit those settings for the system voice?  Based on this question I'm not hopeful, but I thought I'd ask.
