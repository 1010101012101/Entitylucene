Macbook White slow after replacing new battery <body> I'm running 8GB RAM. Recently I got my swollen battery replaced. After getting it back, I also ran some software update from AppStore.  Yesterday, my Mac started to fail on me. It ran incredibly slow on all applications, showing the beachball/spinning disc cursor all the time. Even from login screen, after entering password, the beachball appeared again before it took 5 minutes to authenticate my login. After successful logging in, it took very long time for the Mac to get ready for me to use. Thumbnails on desktop appeared slowly, beachball is always appearing.  I want to believe that this has nothing to do with my battery because it should not have any impact on computer performance. I ran all disk repair, permission repair, Onyx, but it all remains same.  How to troubleshoot this? Thanks.
