Click a tab item in system settings using AppleScript in Automator? <body> I'm trying to create a shortcut to start system preferences and open the sound settings in the "in" tab.  So far I have started system preferences and opend up the audio settings, maybe not in the most elegant way possible but for having started with applescript today I'm quite proud.  Anyways, currently this is my "code":  precodeon run{input, parameters}      activate application "System Preferences"     delay 0.8     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Systeminst채llningar"         tell menu bar item 4 of menu bar 1             click             click menu item "Ljud" of menu 1         end tell     end tell      return input end run /code/pre  Bare in mind that my system is in Swedish so the "Systeminst채llningar" means "System Preferences" and "Ljud" means "Audio" and "Ljud in" means "Audio in"  Thanks in advance.  strongUpdate:/strong Actually just a few minutes after I wrote this I figured out a way to do (new code):  precodeon run{input, parameters}      activate application "System Preferences"     delay 0.8     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Systeminst채llningar"         tell menu bar item 4 of menu bar 1             click             click menu item "Ljud" of menu 1         end tell         delay 1         tell tab group 1 (*New code starts here*)             click             click radio button "Ljud in" of tab 1         end tell     end tell (*Ends here*)      return input end run /code/pre  But I still would love some constructive criticism for how to do this better since I'm fairly certain that this is far from effective.  <answer217449> You can use the codeAppleScript/code command from the strongSystem Preferences/strong application instead of the GUI scripting  precodetell application "System Preferences"     -- open the audio pane and select the "Audio in" tab     reveal anchor "input" of pane id "com.apple.preference.sound"     activate end tell  tell application "System Events" to tell process "Systeminst채llningar"     -- do something in "Ljud in" tab end tell /code/pre
