How to type in the tilde character '~' with an apple international keyboard? <body> I am a French developer, used to the French keyboard layout. Being a developer, I invested recently in an strongApple international keyboard/strong.  Having a french keyboard, typing in the tilde '~' character was quite simple since it was printed on a key as far as I remember, although I don't remember where.  Now with my new International keyboard, the layout is very different, missing accents and other special character (which is ok since I use that keyboard only for development on my mac) but I am facing the issue that I need to type in the tilde character very often, and I don't have any clue on how to type it in in a simple way.  (PS: To type in the '~' character, I am actually using the  "character display pane" coming with Macosx, which is quite cumbersome when you need it often ...)    <answer49237> The "~" key is located between the "left shift" and "Z" keys on the international english keyboard.  Many users are used to have this key under the escape key (the US layout), and they (including me) use the KeyRemap4MacBook software to swap those keys.  strongEdit:/strong KeyRemap4MacBook is now called Karabiner. Here is a screenshot of the configuration I'm using to remap Section to Backquote key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/voBZQ.png" alt="Screenshot of the configuration of Karabiner reaping Section to Backquote"  strongEdit:/strong Karabiner does not work on macOS Sierra, however a new project is in development: Karabiner Elements. As of now, it can do the replacement in question:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3LMC.png" alt="Screenshot of the configuration of Karabiner-Elements showing how to replace Section to Backquote"  <answer85552> AltGr + 4 twice ~~ in Windows XP.  <answer116135> Apple French Keyboard Cheat Sheet  General sequence rules:  Shift Alt-R &amp; then E gives É etc. ` then A gives À etc. Alt-R N then A gives Ã etc.  General sequence rules for `´and ~: French Keyboard for Apple Cheat Sheet for Special sequences and chords  Option N then space gives ~ codethen space gives/code Shift Option &amp; then space gives ´  Option ç gives Ç  Option z gives Â Shift Option z gives Å  Option y gives Ú Option ù gives Ù  Option s gives Ò Shift Option m gives Ó Shift Option ^ gives Ô  Option k gives È Shift Option k gives Ë Shift Option e gives Ê  Option i gives î Option h gives Ì Option j gives Ï Shift Option i gives ï Shift Option h gives Î Shift Option j gives Í  Option é  gives ë Option ^ gives ô Option a gives æ Option o gives œ Shift Option a gives Æ Shift Option o gives Œ  Option ( gives { Option ) gives }  Option w gives ‹ Shift Option w gives ›  Option è gives « Shift Option è gives »  Option codegives @ Shift Option/code gives # Shift $ gives * Shift Option l gives |  <answer169019> In Yosemite holding down  many of the letters a couple of seconds gives a popup window that let's you choose one of various accenting options.

Whilst this is useful information, it doesn't actually answer the question. Also, don't use comments to edit your answer — use the [edit] button and edit the answer directly. <comment198633> That's pretty awesome. Thank you for that tip in Yosemite. But it does not really fit the initial question, right? <comment213613> This wasn't what the OP asked; same as the other post that gave the same answer. <comment213615> Note that for developers ~ is a symbol on its own and is different to the accent ˜ <comment256082> Alt command n does nothing at all on my machine.  What are you talking about?  In what app does this produce ~ for you? <comment300145> Perfect, thanks for this! Works flawlessly. <comment310052> The best keyboard to type programming, and most european language is the **Apple English** or **Apple US English** keyboard, and not at all the **international** or **international english** ones. On the standard **English** keyboard, the [~]  key is just on the top left corner below the [esc] key. All the accented characters are obtained with [⌥] key and the character on which this accent is the most frequently used. For example `é` is typed with [⌥][e], [e], `ñ` is typed with [⌥][n], [n], `ü` is typed with [⌥][u], [u]... <comment310054> If anyone got an **Apple international keyboard** when specifying it is for programming, then ask for a replacement, because the secret differences between the two is a nightmare for work (boot secret combo., frequently used characters: [`\``], [`~`], [`\ `], [`|`]). <comment310058> @danielAzuelos - Not sure I agree with your definition/opinion of 'international english' - see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794 for all the possible layouts - Other than the move of the tilde & backtick to bottom left instead of top left, all the other "secret keys" are right where you expect them... & frankly, I can't stand where they put ~ & ` on the US keyboard ;) <comment310059> The International English keyboard doesn't have a Ç key <comment322342> Note that karabiner don't work for macOS Sierra (10.12) for now. https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/issues/660#issuecomment-226942420
