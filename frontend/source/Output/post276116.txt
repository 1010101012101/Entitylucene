Touch Bar no longer working in Chrome <body> h2Data/h2  ul liBrand new Macbook Pro 13.3" running macOS Sierra/li liNew install of Chrome/li liNo Touch Bar settings ever modified/li /ul  h2Problem/h2  Initially, Chrome would show custom touch bar icons. Like full-colour previews of each tab to switch between them. WhatsApp Web would have text auto prediction.  Suddenly, this isn't showing at all. In fact, in Chrome, there are emno/em icons in the Touch Bar whatsoever, just the Escape key.  h2Question/h2  Since then, I've tried playing with the Touch Bar settings and reinstalling Chrome, but nothing's made a difference. strongAny ideas how to get it back again?/strong  <answer276118> The first things I would do are reset your NVRAM followed by resetting your SMC. See below for further info.  strongResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. /li liKeep these keys pressed down for strongat least 20 seconds!/strong/li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote 1:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongNote 2:/strong These steps will also work to reset the NVRAM (or PRAM) for all Macs. However, the late-2016 MBP models actually required the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys to be held down for 20 seconds, while earlier Macs did not emrequire/em this, but doing so does not cause any problems either.  strongReset the SMC/strong  Your MacBook Pro has a system management controller that can easily be reset. To do this on your particular model, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the strongleft/strong side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Let me know how you go after doing both resets.  <answer277133> strongAnswer:/strong I'm an idiot  strongReal answer:/strong This was never a Chome feature, emit's a Safari feature/em.  I was simply confused as I had to use Safari when trying it out in the Apple Store. Obviously, native Apple apps have more Touch Bar integration but I'm still surprised there's nothing on Chrome and even Canary doesn't have much.  I'm still seeing strange behaviour where in some folders in Finder the delete icon doesn't appear and in some it does, but this question was actually user error.  <comment347447> reinstall the operating system would probably fix it assuming it is not a hardware problem. <comment347487> I'm a little confused why this would help. The Touch Bar works fine in all other apps. Nevertheless, it made no difference. <comment347549> My apologies - I interpreted _WhatsApp Web would have text auto prediction_ as indicating that WhatsApp no longer did this after initially doing so, hence why I thought it was an issue with at least two apps. What exact version of Google Chrome are you running? <comment347693> I just updated to the latest -  57.0.2987.98 (64-bit).  Using Canary I get Touch Bar icons but they are not customisable and there is no way to switch between tabs.  What is the correct Touch Bar behaviour for Chrome?
