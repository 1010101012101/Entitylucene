Multiple disks attached to Airport Extreme only shows some partitions <body> I have a previous generation of Apple's Time Capsule (Airport Extreme with disk.) I have been using an external WD hard disk attached to the USB port and all has been well for years well. I recently added a USB hub - a small powered one, and then added a second WD disk. When both WD disks are attached I do not see all of the partitions on both disks. The partition names are different across the two disks. If I unplug one disk all is good. Both disks have their own power supply so I am not sure if the Amazon USB hub's power is an issue, I would think no. Any idea on what I could do to resolve this?
