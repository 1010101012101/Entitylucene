How to get location on HDD of dropped webloc files? <body> I need to get the file path on the local drive of where a dropped (or several dropped) .webloc files are located. I have already encountered and understand that when dropped on an Applescript Droplet, OSX handles the "open" command  as it would text clippings and opens the url location.   All I can get to work is having to select them with a Finder command window.  I found this same question from 2014 and the following option/suggestion for getting the location after using an "open location" block. The problem is that the user he responded to asked the question to the whole forum again the next day and didn't ever get an answer. So here is the question again.  "It may be that the "on open" handler is also called or some other handler where you might get a reference to the files dropped. If you find one then of course the Finder can give you the paths to the alias files."  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22538084/how-can-i-prevent-an-applescript-from-opening-webloc-files-in-a-new-browser-win
