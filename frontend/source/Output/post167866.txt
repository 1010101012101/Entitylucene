Game freezing every 10 seconds <body> I'm not sure if this qualifies as a legit question here, but I don't know where else to ask.  I have installed the Call of Duty 2 MAC version on my iMac. My system capabilities (RAM, processor, video) are way above the recommended requirements, so I would have expected the game to run smooth.   However, in-game, doesn't matter if I am in the main menu or playing, strongit keeps freezing for about 2 seconds, every 10 seconds/strong or so. I have set the quality settings to maximum and minimum, and it's the same.  Clearly it has nothing to do with in-game quality settings, as it does this even while in the main menu.  Any idea what the problem might be? I suspect my computer (1.5 years old iMac, 2.7GHz i5, 8GB@1600MHz DDR3, GeForce GT 640M 512MB) has a problem... it does boot slower than when I bought it... and overall it's not as fast.  <answer178772> My guess is that it doesn't use multi core as I have the same problem.br iMac 2011, 27â€³, 3.4 GHz i7, 6970M 2 GB, 12 GB RAM, 120 GB SSD.  <answer178773> Your system seems to be good enough, but you can run the system check on this site to verify (under System Requirements).  Other steps to analyze the issue  ul limake sure no other applications are running (including menulets)/li lirun Activity Monitor while playing the game and have an eye on the CPU usage of the various processes/li licontact Aspyr Support and describe your problem/li /ul  <comment197313> My guess would be you have a task or process running in the background (either intentionally or not) and it's accessing your system resources (probably your hard drive) every ~10 seconds.  Is your hard drive almost full?  Open Activity Monitor and spend some time looking for things that may be spiking disk activity. <comment197339> @FlyingTrashcan Thanks, I will. It must be something permanent then, because it's the same even after a computer restart. Hope I can find it :)
