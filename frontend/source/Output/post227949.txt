Copy specific files and keep the subfolder structure <body> I got a folder with a large amount of files with different suffixes in several sub folders.  My automator workflow works as follows:  ol liAsk for Finder Items/li liGet Folder Contents (sub folder option checked)/li liFilter Finder Items (for a specific file-suffix)/li liCopy Finder Items/li /ol  This works like a charm. But all files are copied in the same root destination folder. I need to keep the the sub folder structure. For Example:  precodesourceFolder     subfolderA         fileA.jpg         fileB.xls         fileC.xls     subfolderB         fileC.jpg         fileD.xls         fileE.xls /code/pre  Expected result (filter for file suffix .xls):  precodedestinationFolder     subfolderA         fileB.xls         fileC.xls     subfolderB         fileD.xls         fileE.xls /code/pre  Current result:  precodedestinationFolder     fileB.xls     fileC.xls     fileD.xls     fileE.xls /code/pre  strongUpdate/strong  I'm a developer. So a shell or AppleScript will be also accepted. :)  <answer227958> I end up with a shell script, that works as requested:  precode$ find ./sourceFolder -name "*.xls*" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' /usr/bin/rsync -avR "{}" "./destinationFolder/" /code/pre  <answer227960> In a shell script you can use mkbom to make a BOM (bill of materials) file that contains a list of files that you want to copy.  Then you can use the ditto command with the --bom option to copy only files listed in the BOM file.  <answer228045> precodersync -avh --include='*/' --include='*.xls' --exclude='*' path/to/sourceFolder/ path/to/destinationFolder /code/pre  Note the code//code at the end of the source path, it's emimportant/em. This solution would add all empty directories, if you don't want them, look at the option code--prune-empty-dirs/code.  With brace expansion you can actually include more filetypes at once, rather than having  precode--include='*.xls' --include='*.pdf' --include='*.txt' /code/pre  you can use   precode--include='*.'{xls,pdf,txt} /code/pre  <comment277903> `rsync -avh --include='*/' --include='*.xls' --exclude='*' sourceFolder/ destinationFolder`? With brace expansion you can actually include more filetypes `--include='*.'{xls,pdf,txt}`. <comment277934> ty! Any advantages / disadvantages of your solution? <comment277935> @Manuel ty! Any advantages / disadvantages of your solution? <comment277937> That you don't concatenate through pipes, you just call `rsync` once with the appropiate flags. <comment277974> great. ty! i will test and come back to it. <comment277979> You can add all the options you want, the important part is the includesâ€“excludes: include all directories (necessary for recursivity) and all `.xls` files, then exclude everythingn else. If you want more things like `--delete` add them to your command.
