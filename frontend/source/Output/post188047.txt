Can google inbox on iPhone NOT show contact pictures <body> I am using the google inbox app for iPhone. Is it possible to set it up, so that it does not show pictures of people who is writing to me? I need to recieve work relevant emails from persons whos profile pictures I find offensive, and do not want to look at.  I have been through all the settings I could find and I don't know of a search term or documented feature to allow this  <answer190953> Try changing their photos in your saved contact so that your photo of them shows up instead.  <comment222455> [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) is really nice. <comment226790> Are you open to a solution where no images are shown? <comment226837> @bmike: Yes - I would be very happy, if no profile pictures were shown at all. <comment226839> I do not know why this was downvoted. It is not the solution(I have not tested if it works yet), I was hoping for, but it could be the only option. <comment247954> Unfortunately, `gmail app` and `google inbox` does not use the informations from the contacts app. The pictures are only taken from the google accounts. <comment248364> Aw, that's a bummer. Hopefully, you find a response soon. I'm having issues getting photos on my non-photo email contacts; total opposite! Haha.
