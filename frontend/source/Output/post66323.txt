Cocoa emacs -- open in current space? <body> I usually use several different spaces (desktops?) for various different tasks.  Unfortunately, cocoa emacs 24.1 (9.0), even when using emacsclient (I do a server start in my init.el file) always opens a document or email response in the space emacs was originally started in.  Aquamacs seems better behaved in this respect, but I prefer cocoa emacs.  Is there a way to change this behavior?  Best,  JRV  <answer66415> I've gotten at least a usable approach, tho not perfect.  The best I could do is the following:  1) don't ever use emacsclient and take start server out of init.el  2) in mission control preferences, uncheck the boxes for "when switching to an application..." and "group windows by application"  If I am editing more than one doc, in different desktops I end up with more than one instance of emacs running,  but I can live with this.  Also, the startup seems to be fast enough for me without emacsclient.  It doesn't look like cocoa emacs is impemented as a document based cocoa app.  Is that the case?  Seems like Macvim handles the multiple document without multiple instance case more gracefully.  Best regards.  JRV
