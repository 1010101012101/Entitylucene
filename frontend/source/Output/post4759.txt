Textmate alt-f to move forward by one word <body> I've recently switched from Linux, so I'm still getting a hang of things -- please bare with me. ;)  One thing that is really killing my emacs memory muscles right now is the lack of kbdalt/kbd+kbdf/kbd and kbdalt/kbd+kbdb/kbd to jump forward and backward by word. I've gotten the meta/option flag flipped in Terminal.app preferences (so kbdalt/kbd+kbd./kbd now works as expected), but I haven't found a similar option for Textmate. Even better if I could enable it as a Mac OS X global setting for the U.S. keyboard (so it would work in all input boxes). At the moment I get the following useless (for me) encodings:  kbdalt/kbd+kbdf/kbd: ƒ  kbdalt/kbd+kbdb/kbd: ∫  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!  <answer4760> As usual... KeyRemap4MacBook to the rescue :P   Its emacs mode will give you those bindings, and you can choose a lot more bindings than that as well:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDbFW.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer35453> FYI, it doesn't seem to be mentioned in the Mac shortcuts list, but on my Macbook Air you can press  kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdf/kbd  and  kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdb/kbd  to move forward and backward one word, respectively.  <answer37228> One way to remap the keys in other applications as well would be to create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{     "~b" = moveWordBackward:;     "~f" = moveWordForward:;     "~d" = deleteWordForward:;     "~l" = (moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:, lowercaseWord:);     "~u" = (moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:, uppercaseWord:);     "~c" = (moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:, capitalizeWord:); } /code/pre  You could also codecp /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict ~/Libary/Application\ Support/TextMate/KeyBindings.dict/code and add the same keys there.  <comment4688> Thanks, that did the trick. Excellent find! <comment4689> Thanks Am1rr3zA for pointing out how to style keyboard shortcuts; that looks much better. :) <comment4690> @pithyless: no problem! i love keyremap :P <comment114648> excellent software :D
