iOS Mail uses wrong return address <body> tl;dr: I have several email addresses on the same Mail account, iOS defaults to the wrong one as the sender, and I can't figure out how to change that.  Full version:  I set up my email accounts on my Mac. In Mac OS X Mail's Accounts prefs, it's possible to list several email addresses for an account in a comma-delimited list. I do this, and it works well on the Mac. In the Composing prefs in Mail, I set strongSend new messages from/strong to my primary email address, and that's the one that gets used by default.  On iOS, Mail uses a different email address in the strongFrom/strong and strongReply-To/strong headers. (It's an address I only use for email to/from Yahoo groups). I haven't been able to find anything like Mac OS X Mail's strongSend new messages from/strong setting, so I don't know how I can change this. As a result, email from iOS defaults to having a return address that I really don't want it to have. I only get the preferred address if I remember to change it, every single time.  Deleting the address isn't an option-- I do actually use it, sometimes.  <answer91992> iOS Mail app doesn't function like you are hoping it will unfortunately. The best suggestion I have is to add this mail account twice in iOS Settings, once using each email address you prefer it to have.  <comment108105> Sigh, that's what I thought. Bug filed with Apple...
