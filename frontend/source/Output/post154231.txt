"Unchecking" tracks playing music on iPhone <body> My audio intake from iPhone outweighs that of my Macbook by a double-digit ratio.   Sometimes I encounter an audio track on-the-go that I would like to delete, remove from the playlist, or at least remove the track from the rotation. In iTunes, I would delete the file from the library or uncheck the box next to the track's name.  How can I remove a track from rotation on my iPhone?  iOS 7.1.2, iPhone 5s. emjb solutions welcome/em  <answer154237> In the Songs list or Playlist, just swipe it to the left, like you would an unwanted email, text etc  I haven't tested whether this 'reports back' to iTunes &amp; unchecks it there - I'm running a sync now to see &amp; will edit...  strongemEdit:/em/strong  it doesn't delete or uncheck the track from 'My Music', the definitive iTunes list; but it does remove it from an iTunes Playlist after sync.
