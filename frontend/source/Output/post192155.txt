Software Update Permissions error <body> This is a really weird one. Anytime I try to update any OSX items via System Update I get a bizarre permissions error.  The screenshots tell the story...  Here is my attempt to run the update:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjjMW.png" alt=""  Here is my console log when I run the update:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDeRK.png" alt=""  Lastly here are my permissions on the folder that is being denied from the console log:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eGYcq.png" alt=""  The background info about this system is that it is a work computer that was originally set up for another user. He was set up as the admin, then I was given this machine. His account was deleted and mine was given admin privileges.  Anyone seen anything like this?  <answer192609> I've seen errors like this after an emApply to enclosed items/em was done to the codeMacintosh HD/code.  code/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxfn_n00000s0000068/code shouldn't be owned by your user account, but by code_softwareupdate (UID=200)/code. I see errors about code…n00000sb400002s (_spotlight=89)/code and code…n00000sm00006d (_locationd=205)/code as well, which isn't a good sign.  You could just reset code/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxfn_n00000s0000068/code permissions to code200:200/code with a codechown -R/code (codesudo chown -R 200:200 /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00000s0000068/code). /var/folders itself should be owned by root.  Since you've removed it, you could recreate (might have to recreate the 0,T and C subfolders too…) it and set its ownership as above. You could do that now, and it might let software updates download, maybe even install. It also might not.  You could remove /var/folders, but I've seen a system that didn't like that. If the permissions on it are mangled and you'd like to try without it, I recommend renaming it in single user mode first.  <comment228452> It's preferable (besides using the official image uploader rather than ephemeral links to Dropbox) to include text as text rather than screenshots of text. <comment228453> sorry @grgarside. i tried to use inline images, but my reputation is too low <comment228454> The folder is not owned by you. What happens if you remove it (`sudo rm -rf ...`) and try again? <comment228456> thanks @patrix - i do own that folder (tollb1 is my user account name). after deleting that folder software update now immediately fails <comment228457> @patrix here is what my console looks like when i try to update now [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/311cxkqwshqp0zo/Screenshot%202015-06-18%2014.33.49.png?dl=0) <comment228458> Strange. It's mdworker writing the log entries now, not software updater. Things I would try: Update through the AppStore app and (if this fails) reboot <comment228480> @patrix thanks again, but still no dice. <comment229530> thanks for the answer. i've manually installed my updates by tracking them down on apple's site. i'll def give this a try next time though. seems like you might have hit the nail on the head. <comment231066> `sudo chown -R 200:200 /var/folders/zz` just fixed my issue. THANKS! <comment231353> well, if that was the exact command, the softwareupdate service account now owns all the service account folders, and other things will (continue?) have problems. only `/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxfn_n00000s0000068` should belong to _softwareupdate. <comment231590> oh, good to know. i haven't noticed any problems, but thanks for the heads up.
