Keeping Lion-style synchronized desktop switching with multi-monitor on Mavericks <body> Is there a way in Mavericks to get multi-monitor desktop switching behavior similar to (Mountain) Lion?  Example setup: Thunderbolt monitor + Macbook. Each with three desktops. (1,2,3) &amp; (4,5,6)  Lion: When swithching desktop from either monitor, the other monitor always switches along to the 'matching' desktop, eg. 1 &amp; 4, 2 &amp; 5, 3 &amp; 6.  Mavericks: Each monitor's three desktops can switch separately and don't influence the other.  While I definitely see the value of Mavericks' style, I want the old style back. Does anyone know a way to do this?  <answer107273> In System Preferences  Mission Control, toggle off the "Displays have separate Spaces" setting. That'll switch the behavior back to Mountain Lion's.
