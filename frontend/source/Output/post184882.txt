can't commit network settings via command line <body> I'm writing a Python script that changes network settings with commands like codenetworksetup -setv4off 'PANTECH UML295'/code and codenetworksetup -setdhcp 'PANTECH UML295'/code. When I enter these in Terminal, I enter my root password, and then nothing changes in Network settings. Enabling/disabling WiFi using codenetworksetup setairportpower en1 off/code seems to work fine, however. Any idea on what might be the problem? Can't seem to find anything through search. Thanks.  <comment219313> You won't see anything change in the network settings, you have go to the advanced setting, to see those. Also I assume you skipped clientid argument in the `-setdhcp` here. Do `networksetup -getinfo PANTECH\ UML295` to see the changes. <comment219457> @user14492 All I want to do is change the `Configure IPv4` under Network settings between `Using DHCP` and `Off`, which I had been able to do before. I'm on a fresh install of OS X so I don't know what could be the problem. <comment219493> It seems to work for me, to set it to off I just did `networksetup -setv4off Thunderbolt\ Ethernet` and to set it back to Using DHCP, `networksetup -setdhcp Thunderbolt\ Ethernet`. Make sure you're writing the name correctly, and for both the commands it needs the network service name. Which you can get by `networksetup -listallnetworkservices`. Try those commands in the Terminal and see if they produce any errors. <comment219707> @user14492 That is strange. That is exactly what I've been doing and still nothing changes after entering root password.
