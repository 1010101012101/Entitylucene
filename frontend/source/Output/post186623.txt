OS X ending - character when viewing source <body> To view an email's source code in Mail.app, you can press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⌥ option/kbd kbd U /kbd. However, the source view is cut off every line on a certain character. Changing a line like this:  precode&lt;img src=3D"https://phs-proto.ehv.campus.philips.com//mail/btn-bottom-left.gif" height=3D"3" width=3D"3" alt=3D"" border=3D"0" style=3D"display: block; width:3px; height:3px;" /&gt;  &lt;img src=3D"https://phs-proto.ehv.campus.philips.com//mail/btn-b= ottom-left.gif" height=3D"3" width=3D"3" alt=3D"" border=3D"0" sty= le=3D"display: block; width:3px; height:3px;" /&gt; /code/pre  Notice the code=/code sign at the end of the lines. Is there a workaround for this issue?  <answer186631> I assume this is in a section of the email marked with  precode--_000_7ACBD9F85F865846BB187E5B1529E52F25B26392F5LBCPLCYVMB002_ Content-Type: text/html; charset="us-ascii" Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable /code/pre  Where the first line would be a different long series of digits.  In this case = just marks a line continuation, To get the text delete it and the following CR and LF characters.  The encoding is needed as email as per RFC5322 says     Lines of characters in the body MUST be limited to 998 characters,         and SHOULD be limited to 78 characters, excluding the CRLF.   The encoding is quoted-printable and that is defined in RFC2045     (Soft Line Breaks) The Quoted-Printable encodingbr             REQUIRES that encoded lines be no more than 76br             characters long.  If longer lines are to be encodedbr             with the Quoted-Printable encoding, "soft" line breaksbr             must be used.  An equal sign as the last character on abr             encoded line indicates such a non-significant ("soft")br             line break in the encoded text.   The workaround is use a script to decode the MIME encapsulation
