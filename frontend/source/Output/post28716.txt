Run bash command with current URL as parameter from Firefox and/or safari <body> I'd like to be able, without much hassle, add a video to my Miro Download-queue.  From bash I can do this by entering  precodeopen -a Miro.app http://vimeo.com/24398084 /code/pre  Now I'd like to do this from within Firefox, preferrably a one-click approach. Is there a firefox addon I could use? Some automator mechanism I could trigger?  <answer28767> You could create an automator service like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ufotN.png" alt="enter image description here"  The service receives no input. It gets the URL of the current page in Safari, and passes it as the argument to codeopen -a Miro.app/code.  You could then assign it a keyboard shortcut, et voil√†.  <comment33072> +1 but can you use Firefox in automator to do this? <comment33110> @macaco If you're willing to use two keystrokes, then yes. Service receives selected text in any application. Then drop the first action. To invoke, press Command-L then the shortcut for the service.
