How can I restore an iPad to factory defaults? <body> I'm planning to sell / give my old iPad to a friend.  I've already saved everything that I want off of the old iPad.  How can I restore the old iPad to factory default settings so that my friend can start fresh?  It's a first-gen iPad, in case it matters.  <answer45254> In iPad Settings, go to General, then Reset, then "Erase All Contents and Settings". The next thing you see ( after confirmation) is the welcome screen as if just out of the box.  Also: If shipping it you might want to power off by holding top and bottom buttons until you see the "slide to power off" slider. I recently sold my iPad 2, cleared it to factory settings as described and powered off. Happy new owner received it with charge, ready to configure.  <comment51532> Damn you're quick... <comment51534> I'm typing on an iPad too. <comment51542> That was super easy - thanks!
