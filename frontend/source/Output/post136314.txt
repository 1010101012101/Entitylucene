Where did the MacPro 6,1 "Computer Sleep" setting go? <body> Anybody got a clue where the MacPro6,1 power / sleep setting went?    The only thing I can set is the "Turn display off after" slider.  On my old MacPro2,1 there were two settings:  ul liComputer sleep/li liDisplay sleep/li /ul  strongNew MacPro6,1 Energy Saver Dialog/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/js6qm.png" alt="MacPro6,1 energy settings"  strongMacPro2,1 / MacPro4,1 Energy Saver Dialog/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lNnCx.png" alt="enter image description here"  edit 1:  More frustrating, my PC goes into strongsleep/standby/strong even when im running something like Terminal with SSH session.  On the old system you could set a different sleep for the computer (i'm fine my screen goes to sleep in 5 minutes).  precode$ pmset -g   Active Profiles: AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standby              1  Sleep On Power Button 1  womp                 1  autorestart          0  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  darkwakes            0  gpuswitch            2  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            10  sleep                1  autopoweroffdelay    14400  hibernatemode        0  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         10  standbydelay         10800 /code/pre  <answer136323> It is probable that Apple no longer feels the strongComputer sleep/strong and strongDisplay sleep/strong options are required.  The new Mac Pro has no spinning hard disk drives and has a modern power management system that can manage itself.  I suspect you can change settings using low level tools like pmset, but that those settings will be ignored.  h2Staying Awake/h2  To keep your Mac awake during long running processes, use the strongTerminal.app/strong command caffeinate:  precodecaffeinate /code/pre  <comment161690> what happens when you use restore defaults? and what os is it? <comment161691> nothing, my mac is just a few days old. I guess since it doesn't have a HDD (but SSD) Apple thinks we don't need it? <comment161694> That is funny :) you should be able to set it, and not have Apple boss you around. run the pmset -g in terminal to see your current settings. <comment161700> Thanks, right (makes sense). Any idea how i can keep it awake while my screen can goto sleep (like with a huge download) ? <comment161703> @Rogier terminal ping -i 300 google.com keeps the network alive till you kill it. <comment161705> To keep your Mac awake during a long download, use the http://www.dssw.co.uk/reference/caffeinate.html command e.g. `caffeinate`. Ideally, your downloading application will register a 'do not sleep assertion' and this will avoid idle time sleep interrupting your download. <comment161707> even when i use ping from terminal it goes to sleep :( <comment162156> @GrahamMiln,  thank you for pointing out caffeinated. I wrapped caffeinated inside my *bash_profile*, so when starting a ssh session it automatically "caffeinates" ssh.
