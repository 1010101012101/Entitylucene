Stop-Motion movie <body> I want to make a simple Stop Motion movie on my mac. It will be very simple, as a dialog between 2 "playmobils" sitting in a car.   So, the animation will just only be "mouth movements" and "eye winks", to make them look "alive".  What would be your advice about the software to be used to paste different eyes and mouths quickly and easily to create the successive snapshots ? (Consider that I have no budget to do this, so avoid the answer "Adobe CS 4" ;-). To make the editing, I will use the (outstanding) iMovie. (what else? ;-)  ul liWhich App would you use to create the different mouth shapes ?/li liWhich App would you use to paste them on the unique picture of the 2 playmobils ?/li /ul  emPS / I know it's not really a Q&amp;A question, but instead more a "advice request", but please do not close it to fast :-)/em  <answer3843> ul liFree: GIMP.

Not free, not the cheapest, but very good quality.
