Access messages in Outlook's 'Drafts' folder <body> I would like to use a message that is stored in the 'Drafts' folder as a template for other messages.  Unfortunately, I don't have the correct syntax:  precodetell application "Microsoft Outlook"    -- locate the message   set theMessage to the first message in mail folder drafts &lt;== error: 'Can't make mail folder id 107 into type integer'    -- show subject (testing)   display dialog of the subject of theMessage    -- for each contact with category 'foo'     -- copy message     -- add sender     -- add first name to message's body     -- set delivery date to 5 minutes in the future     -- send message   -- end loop  end tell /code/pre  What am I missing?  <answer101084> The corrected code:  precode-- locate the message set theMessage to the first message in drafts  -- show subject (testing) display dialog of the (subject of theMessage as text) /code/pre
