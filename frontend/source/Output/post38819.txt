Why does iterm2 close new sessions immediately? <body> I've made some changes to my code.bashrc/code file in my new MacBook, mainly aliases for common commands.  Shortly after, iterm2 immediately closes every new session or tab with the following cryptic message:  precode## exec failed ## argpath= error=No such file or directory /code/pre  strongNotes:/strong  ul licodeterminal/code works fine./li liI've tried to rename code.bashrc/code and relaunch codeiterm/code, but the problem persists./li /ul  <answer38835> The default shell was a codecommand/code shell without command, not a codelogin shell/code.  Solution:  kbdiTerm/kbd-kbdPreferences/kbd-kbdProfiles/kbd-kbdGeneral/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd  Set radio button to kbdLogin shell/kbd  <answer38872> Given the error message, you are trying to assign some value to the codeargpath/code variable, but you have a space after the code=/code -- no spaces allowed there.  <answer252834> For some others go to iTerm  Preferences  Profiles  General  Command.  If the radio button is ‘Login shell’ change the radio button to ‘Command’ and enter      /bin/bash -l   Should look something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P5EWB.png" alt=""  <comment43953> When you say "no luck", do you mean you are unable to rename .bashrc, or that when you do, the problem persists? If it is the second, have you relaunched iTerm2 or rebooted since renaming .bashrc? <comment43955> Clarified the question - I meant that the renaming did not help. I will try to reboot now. <comment331212> just worked for me on 3.0.12 <comment331283> nice.. glad I was helpful <comment345708> Isn't there a setting you can uncheck to leave the briefly active session open?
