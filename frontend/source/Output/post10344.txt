Is there a way to add shortcuts to open a particular folder in Save Dialogs and Finder Windows? <body> I know that when you're saving or opening a file kbd⌘/kbd kbdshift/kbd kbdD/kbd shoots you to the Desktop folder, and pressing kbd⌘/kbd kbdshift/kbd kbdD/kbd whilst using finder shoots you to the desktop folder as well.   strongIs there a way to create a custom shortcut to jump to your own choice of folder?/strong (e.g. kbd⌘/kbd kbdshift/kbd kbdW/kbd for your 'Work' folder).  <answer10398> By default, no.  What I've done is drag folders I access frequently to the Places section in the left side bar.  There is software to accomplish this though.  Default Folder X does this, and more.  If you're in a save dialogue you can press kbd//kbd to get a file path dialogue, or press kbd⌘/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd to get a "Go to folder" dialogue.  <answer88083> Not a shortcut, but you can drag finder proxy icons (in the titlebar), folders and even files into open/save dialogues to jump to the folder (if you drag a file, the file name field will be prefilled with its file name).  <comment10933> Thanks! I'll give DFX a go; also good to know the / trick. I'll see if anyone else has any suggestions and come back and Correct Answer your answer. <comment10935> Since DFX is $50NZ I might leave it for now, looks great though. I've put an alias to my work folder in the top level, and I'm going to try going /W TAB to get there quick. Not ideal, but looks like best built in option so far.
