What can *.itc files contain when not PNG or JPG? <body> Yesterday I was a bit curious what iTunes code.itc/code (by default in code~/Music/iTunes/Album Artwork/code) files were.   After a bit of research, I made a script to convert .itc to images (JPG &amp; PNG).   For 1913 itc files : I get 467 png &amp; 636 jpg files.   I was wondering what the other itc could be. Any idea ?    <answer104538> Well thanks @beroe for the link.   After some digging I wrote a little documentation of code.itc/code files.   code.itc/code files are actually wrapper of images that are either PNG, JPG or ARGB raw files. code.itc/code files can hold multiple images with different size. Most of the time there are 3 images of (128*128, 256*256 &amp; 400*400).    I wrote a little bash script that convert all code.itc/code files into jpg or png and puts them in code~/Music/iTunes/Album Artwork/Images/code.   <comment122764> Just a guess, but you tried TIFF and GIF? Cool script btw! [This script](http://www.sffjunkie.co.uk/python-itc.html) says ARGB which exports to PNG? <comment122853> Nice script, i'll dig into it ! <comment123010> It sounds like a disk version of Apple's NSImage class, so it can probably contain more image representations than you listed.
