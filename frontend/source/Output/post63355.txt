web sharing on lion - odd behavior <body> In my Lion local web sharing folder, I noticed that I cannot change any of the files without typing in my password.  I also noticed that there's a folder called postgresql there.  I don't remember having these behaviours before with Snow Leopard, are these new changes that Lion OS brings?  <answer63469> The permissions of some folders did change to more restrictive on Lion. I don't know about 10.6, but /Library/WebServer/Documents/ is owned by root and has 751 permissions on 10.8 as well.  I don't have any postrgesql folder by default on 10.8, but 10.7 might have had one.  Files are normally meant to put be to ~/Sites/ and accessed from codehttp://localhost/~username//code. The URLs can be made shorter by adding virtual hosts.  You could change the owner back to yourself with codesudo chown -R $USER /Library/WebServer/Documents//code.  <comment73288> Does `ls -lad ~/Sites/` start with `drwxr-xr-x  5 yourname`? If not, you can restore the default owner with `sudo chown $USER ~/Sites/` or permissions with `chmod 751 ~/Sites/`. <comment73289> Or do you mean `/Library/WebServer/Documents/`? <comment73294> @Lri I mean `/Library/WebServer/Documents/`. Thank you for helping. <comment73295> I noticed that my Documents folder gives me read access only. Is this new since Lion? Also is the postgresql folder new since Lion?
