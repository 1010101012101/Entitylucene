How to only import JPG on iPad when shooting in RAW+JPEG <body> I shoot in RAW+JPEG mode. When I import photo to the iPad using the camera connection kit, it imports both versions of each file. Is there a way to only import the JPG version?  <comment59976> Have you found a solution to this at all yet? I would be interested to know myself. <comment60037> No solution yet. I'll post an update if I find one.
