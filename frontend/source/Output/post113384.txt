How to trigger lid close action programmatically? <body> Is there a way to trigger the lid close action programmatically with a script or through terminal?   I am testing this by placing a small magnet near the SD slot on my MacBook Pro.   <answer113618> There is no Apple supported programming interface to simulate the lid being closed.  You can put your Mac to sleep using this command line:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to sleep' /code/pre  <answer258680> You may put your machine to sleep with a shell script:  precodepmset sleepnow /code/pre  P.S. If you intend to run this from a script, be prepared that machine won't sleep until script finishes, and if that's something like a daemon running in a loop, it won't ever work unless you run codepmset/code in a subshell:  precode(pmset sleepnow &amp;) /code/pre  <comment133070> Does it have to be a "lid close action" specifically, or are you looking to programmatically put the machine to sleep? <comment134236> Thanks for the answer, i was actually trying to get my mac to use external display as primary only. Upgrading to OSX Mavericks solved all my issues and it was free. <comment346508> @louisinhongkong how did you get into clamshell mode without closing your laptop?! I'm on sierra
