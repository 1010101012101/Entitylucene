Preventing automatic backtick ` <body> When I type a backtick ` it's underlined and I can press space to make it this character Â´. This is annoying because I never need this when I type in markdown I only need the backtick. So I wonder how I can turn this off?  <answer191830> Try alt/option plus shift plus `  <comment227916> I guess you cannot turn it off, but you could press CTRL-BACKTICK, which gives an immediate backtick. (The same with SHIFT-CTRL-BACKTICK.) <comment227920> @TomGewecke: You're right - tested it with an US keyboard. It only works on my german keyboard. There are both ticks on one key. <comment227927> @TomGewecke: At first I thought this, too. But it is in deed CTRL. I have a similar annoying issue when working with Markdown. And this is my personal solution. Otherwise I would create accents and such instead of Markdown code. <comment227946> I'm in DevonThink and FileMaker. But it's the same in TextEdit etc. <comment227955> I see now, ctrl does work with that key in the german layout.  Kind of odd, as apple doesn't normally use ctrl for characters.
