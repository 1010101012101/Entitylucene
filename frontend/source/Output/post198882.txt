OS X Traceroute Command: what is '*' <body> Using the codetraceroute/code command in  OS X 10.9.x, multiple '*' characters are printed as output. Can anyone explain exactly what these are and what they mean?  Command output example:   precodetraceroute to www.google.com (xxx.xxx.xx.xxx), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets  1  * * *  2  * * *  3  * * *  4  * * *  5  * * *  6  * /code/pre  <answer198883> That means traceroute didn't get any responses to its probes. The way it works is that it sends out test packets set to expire after 1 hop, two hops, etc; then it listens for "sorry, but your packet expired before I could deliver it" and prints the addresses of the routers that sent those responses. The "*"s mean it didn't hear back.  You're getting all "*"s, which means that either there's no route to the destination, or there's a firewall blocking the probes and/or the responses, or something along those lines.  <comment238174> See [this post](http://serverfault.com/questions/334029/what-does-mean-when-traceroute)  at ServerFault for the answer. <comment238181> Yes you answered that perfectly, and i would expect its the pesky firewall. <comment367626> The [consensus](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/2950/295232) is that things like 'Thanks in advance' are unnecessary noise. We know that you're grateful for any answers to your question; you don't need to state that in your post. <comment367627> The Ask Different way to say “Thanks!” is to upvote helpful answers and accept the one that helps you best. <comment367711> I will keep that in mind.
