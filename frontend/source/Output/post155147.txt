Quick look .url saved webpages as rendered HTML <body> I thought this was already possible in earlier versions of OS X but Yosemite seems to be missing the 'Web.qlgenerator' quick look plugin (or at least I am)  How do you enable .url quick look to see rendered html in Yosemite?  I found this question of someone who wants to disable the rendered html and have it show to source code instead, so it should be possible    <answer155170> Quick Look doesn't make web requests, so it can't show the contents of the webpage without opening it. The question you linked was asking about code.html/code files, with the actual source saved locally. code.url/code files only include a URL, so without downloading the page it can't render anything. You can still use code.html/code or code.webarchive/code files and they will be rendered in Quick Look (with a code.webarchive/code everything, including images and styles, will be included).
