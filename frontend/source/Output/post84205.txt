iPad 4 not charging solution with usb 3.0 dual ports Y adapter <body> Just recently picked up an iPad 4.  Saw that it specifies "not charging" when plugged into the usb port.  Saw that it is a common issue due to usb power.  I have usb 3.0 ports on my desktop so I tried that and the same result.  USB 3.0 is specified for up to 900 ma while 2.0 is 500ma.  Course even that can change depending on a few things.  Seems that the iPad wants up to 2.1 amps.  So I searched for solution using dual usb ports like some external 2.5" laptop hard drives use.  I found nothing which surprised me.  If I can get 900ma x 2 ports (for 1.8 total amps) I am near the full charge spec for the iPad.    Such cables seem foreign but I found 2 of them.  Most Y cables like this come with a mini usb at the end so these are unfortunately rare and more expensive (unless you want to solder your own which I suppose I could do too with my abundance of cables). http://www.shopaddonics.com/itemdesc.asp?ic=AA2USBPC http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812161003  From here the lightning cord would simply plug into the female end.  Anyone tried something like this?  Result?  <answer246434> A few years late, but something like this will help.

It should give you a full 1AH with the power connectors from both USB ports, assuming your hub can output more than 500mah total.  <comment96864> Welcome to the site.

What can I do?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/274/ipad-displays-not-charging-when-plugged-into-usb-ports-what-can-i-do) .. FWIW, if you turn off your iPad screen, it *will* charge slowly even from USB ports that cause "Not Charging" to display. <comment347765> It should be noted that the USB spec doesn't actually support Y Cables, so you mightn't get a good solution from that. A USB hub with it's own power supply, connected to my Mac Mini that has a "High Power" USB port is how I charge my iPad Mini 4
