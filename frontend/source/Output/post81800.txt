Is it possible to have my iPhone 5 on silent except for one specific person? <body> I want to have the phone on silent (no vibrate) and have it ring only for one or two specific people. Is there any way to do this?  I know how to turn the phone on silent (the switch on the left side above the volume buttons), but I can't seem to create a "profile" for this (I recall this being possible with Blackberry's).  <answer81803> This is possible using Do-Not-Disturb - a new feature in iOS 6.  ol liOpen Settings.app/li liGo to Notifications  Do Not Disturb/li liSelect "Allow Calls From"/li liYou have several options. Either create a group, or have only those few people in your Favorites. The best is probably to create a group as that allows you better flexibility. After you have created the group with only the people that you want to allow to reach you, select it from the list. /li liNow, to enable silent mode except for those two people turn on Do Not Disturb in Settings.app./li /ol  emCreating/Editing Groups:/em This isn't as easy as it appears on iOS. See my question about it. As mentioned in the accepted answer, your best strategy for creating or editing groups is to go to iCloud.com on your computer. Quoting the answer:     "No, there is no way to create or edit contact groups on iOS. I share your frustration! The best workaround is to use iCloud.com (or your primary Mac, if you have it with you)."   But you can add contacts to a particular group, (though it isn't straight-forward):     ol   liIn Contacts, tap the Groups button in the top left/li   liTap "Hide All Contacts"/li   liTap the group that you want to add the contact to (making it the only visible group)/li   liTap Done in the top right/li   liTap the Add button (code+/code) in the top right/li   /ol   So, the easiest is to just use a Mac (if you have one) or iCloud.com to create and add people to a group. After this is done, the new group with the people that you want to reach you should appear on iPhone.  <answer84393> For those that do not have DND, assign a memorable individual ring tone to each one in the group so you'll even know who is calling. Then assign a silent sound as the default ring for everyone else.
