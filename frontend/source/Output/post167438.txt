Popcorn-Time movies error loading data, try again later <body> The error appears when choosing the movies tab. I am noticing it in Popcorn-Time Version 0.3.5-4 (0.3.5-4), OS X 10.10.1.  Also noticed that the movie thumbnails are not appearing.  <answer167439> Fixed it by clearing the parent directory code/Users/SOME_USER/Library/Application Support/Popcorn-Time/code. (Replace codeSOME_USER/code)  I also have to clear all cache and data.  I also got the latest version from the continuous build in http://ci.popcorntime.io/job/Popcorn-Time/  strongUpdate/strong: I also use this technique to debug. I run the app in the command line.  precode$ pwd /Applications/Popcorn-Time.app/Contents/MacOS $ ./node-webkit /code/pre  Noticed this error (replace xxx with the username).  precode[61835:0207/235212:ERROR:leveldb_database.cc(280)] Failed to open LevelDB database     from /Users/xxx/Library/Application Support/Popcorn-Time/IndexedDB/app_host_0.indexeddb.leveldb,     IO error: /Users/xxx/Library/Application Support/Popcorn-Time/IndexedDB/app_host_0.indexeddb.leveldb/LOCK:     No further details. (ChromeMethodPFE: 15::LockFile::1) /code/pre  I deleted code/Users/xxx/Library/Application Support/Popcorn-Time/IndexedDB/code and the issue disappears.
