Pros and cons of wiping a new Mac? <body> Coming from the PC world, most made-to-order manufacturers (e.g., Dell, HP, Acer, etc.) all have annoying little addons which I consider spyware/bloatware--things like toolbars with ads. When buying such PC laptops, I would always reformat their hard drives and then install emjust Windows/em (and drivers), ensuring a blank slate without any bloat.  I don't believe Apple includes such spyware/bloatware. Nevertheless, when purchasing a new machine direct from Apple, are there are any advantages or disadvantages to wiping the existing drive and performing a fresh install of OS X?  <answer188437> There isn't any advantage to wiping and reinstalling OS X on a new Mac direct from Apple.  You'll end up with the exact same drive contents.  I can't think of any difference between an Apple-imaged Mac and a self-imaged Mac.  <answer188442> Wiping the disk could disable the software necessary to implement FileVault 2, Apple's method of full disk encryption.  <answer188451> There are several disadvantages:   ul liMost internet posts describing how to reinstall OS X miss the hardware specific diagnostic boot image that is stored on Recovery HD (this has changed starting with El Capitan 10.11)./li liYou will lose the iLife apps if you don't first boot the factory OS and claim those redemptions to an Apple ID./li /ul  The recovery boot isn't a deal breaker if you don't mind using a generic internet recovery boot image when needed. Or you can find and reinstall the following folder on the 'Recovery HD':br code/com.apple.recovery.boot/.diagnostics/codebr   So, your call on what happens when pressing and holding the 'D' button at startup.  Losing iMovie, Photos (or iPhotos if the Mac shipped with that as well/instead), GarageBand doesn't matter if you purchased the hardware under a DEP program or don't care to use those or already have them or don't care to spend money later to buy them as needed.  <answer188872> No, Apple doesn't have any bloatware. But I still see two advantages:  ul liFree up some space (precious if you have 128 GB SSD) if you won't be using iLife apps such GarageBand or use Office instead of iWork apps. They can consume a few gigabytes. And you will be still able install them later as when you first run Mac App Store, it will run a check of your serial number to see if you're eligible to download it for free./li liConsider splitting Fusion Drive to two drives - fast SSD for system, apps and home folder, and large HD for other, more space consuming media such as videos. Of course out-of-box FD is working well but geeks like us might want to be more in control of what's happening with our data./li /ul  Apple Diagnostics can be loaded from Internet with option-D. This lists the disk images which are loaded.  Just a warning - some apps such as Adobe won't work with case-sensitive format.  <comment223007> You can enable full disk encryption without wiping the OS first <comment223008> I think Griffin's thinking of Core Storage, which is required for FileVault 2. Wiping the HD could undo the Core Storage volume. <comment223013> Assuming you buy it new from Apple or a vendor you trust, there is no need to reinstall it. If you buy it used or from a vendor you don't really trust, you should reinstall it to avoid using a potentially compromised machine. <comment223016> One advantage, if you're coming from Linux, is that it's an opportunity to format your disk with a case-sensitive file system. <comment223025> @user24601 But the installer would rectify this again (all naturally depending on the machine).  Now breaking up a fusion drive is a different kettle of fish. <comment223047> @Jubobs Is there not an in-place way to convert it? I would assume that on a filesystem level it's just a flag within the metadata. <comment223077> @hexafraction As far as I know, no. You have to format the disk if you want to change case sensitivity. <comment223116> `I don't believe Apple includes such spyware` Well, obviously the're doing a better job of hiding it than Microsoft... <comment223164> @Levi the type of spyware/bloatware I was referring to is actually more like third party vendor software. E.g., a "Dell search bar" that might come pre-installed on top of the OS and contain random ads that popup or a tracking script. It makes sense that OS X wouldn't have anything like this (especially when purchasing a machine direct from apple.com). <comment223165> The local diagnostics don't get re-installed with a fresh OS X installation? <comment223169> Yes, that's what I tried to convey with my answer. <comment223557> I disagree with this. There are two major drawbacks to a nuke and pave. 1) You potentially lose your iLife apps 2) you lose potentially lose hardware specific recovery boot software <comment223558> OS X can convert a non core storage drive to core storage on the fly or ask for a reboot if needed to accomplish the switch later. I suppose that's a downside in time if you are doing dozens or more machines.
