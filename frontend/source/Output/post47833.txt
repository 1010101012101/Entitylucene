What SATA does an early 2011 MacBook Pro has? <body> I want to get a SSD for my early 2011 MacBook Pro 15" and I'm not sure what SATA interface it has and what it would be the best price/performance blend.  <answer47834> I happen to use a MBP 15" early 2011 and it has a SATA 3 (6.0 Gbit/s) interface.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/boVPT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment54812> I don't want to give a general price recommendation for an SSD because the performance of SSDs varies quite noticeably depending on the manufacturer. Instead, I try to follow recommendations that people give who have used the specific SSD model for some time. <comment54813> Thanks, I'm considering preordering the new Intel 330 model but as you may expect, I cannot get any existing reviews on it yet.
