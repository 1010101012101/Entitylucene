Configuring the Dock to be Spaces-centric <body> I use multiple displays, and the available options for Spaces that I am aware of allow surprise Space-switching, even when working in a completely different space.  Ideally, interacting with the Dock will only affect the same Space on the same display on which I used the Dock. This means:  ol liIf app clicked in Dock, and no copy of app is running on any space, then start the app and confine it to the current Space./li liIf app clicked in Dock, and the program is already running in another Space, then either 1) open a new window if the program allows this, or 2) silently move the app to the current Space without disturbing or changing any other Space or display./li liIf app clicked in Dock, and the program is already running in the current Space, then change focus to the app./li /ol  Specifically: - Clicking an icon in the Dock should rarely affect any other Space. - Clicking an icon in the Dock must never affect which Space is displayed on which display  OS X Yosemite 10.10.2, MacBook Pro 2012. (Dock set to auto-hide, and pops up at the bottom of any screen when I put the mouse there.)  <answer179343> 3 questions in one, so I numbered your points to make answering easier…  ol liSet the app's space compliance to None [right click the app in the Dock]/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HAAj.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" li1) Mac apps don't do that, no new instance will be created unless none exists.br 2) Can only be done if the compliance is set to All Desktops - but that means it will always follow you around; probably not what you want./li liFocus will switch to that app, whatever Space it is running in. There is no way to change that behaviour./li /ol  Pro Tips…  Click/hold the title bar of any app &amp; use a key command to switch Spacebr  - by default kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd num /kbd will bring the app with you to that requested Space  Personally, I find separate Spaces per display untenable, so have it switched off. My monitors switch in pairs…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wQTAu.png" alt="enter image description here"
