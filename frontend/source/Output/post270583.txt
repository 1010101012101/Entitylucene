Mac display very gray after installing updates; external monitors look fine <body> Last night I allowed my Mac to install some updates; unfortunately I didn't check to see which updates were being installed. When I came to my computer this morning it seemed to be on but the screen was completely black. I tried waking it up by pressing buttons, hitting the power button, etc. but nothing worked. Eventually, I did a hard shutdown by holding down the power button.  When I turned it on again, the Mac booted up just fine, but all the colors on the laptop's display are completely wrong. They seem just fine on my external monitors, though. I checked the color settings and everything seems to be normal. Does anybody have any idea what could be going on and how to fix it?  This is my Mac with the weird colors:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MTHQ3.jpg" alt="Mac with gray screen"  For comparison, this is what my external monitor looks like (totally normal):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WP2W2.jpg" alt="Monitor looking normal"  strongEDIT/strong  Welp, at some point today the screen went back to normal. I didn't catch when it happened, but it wasn't after a reboot or anything.
