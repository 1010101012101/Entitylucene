What hard drive is used for the 500 GB Macbook Pro option from Apple? <body> I'm looking to replace my Macbook Pro 13" hard drive. I tried upgrading to a Seagate Momentus XT 500 GB, but returned the drive because it caused the palm rest to vibrate when pressed (I installed correctly; the problem disappeared when I swapped back the stock drive).   What drive is used by Apple as the 500 GB option (for both the 7200 and 5400 RPM) when ordering from their store (I figure this should be a good option)? Anyone else have experience with any large notebook drives that don't cause vibration or noise issues? Performance is a second to not having a computer that irritates my senses to no end.  <answer6373> I don't know about the 7200, but my mid-2010 MBP has the following (from system profiler):  precodeHitachi HTS545050B9SA02:    Capacity: 500.11 GB (500,107,862,016 bytes)   Model:    Hitachi HTS545050B9SA02                    Revision: PB4AC60W   Native Command Queuing:   Yes   Queue Depth:  32   Removable Media:  No   Detachable Drive: No   BSD Name: disk0   Rotational Rate:  5400   Medium Type:  Rotational /code/pre  I too had trouble with noise and vibration with a Seagate Momentus XT (the hybrid drive).  After reinstalling the stock drive it's quiet and vibration free again.  <answer6374> I have been using a Western Digital Scorpio Blue 500GB in my June 2009 MBP without any problems. I have tried the Seagate 7200 rpm 2.5" 500 GB as well, but that did warm up and vibrate more than I liked, so moved it to my Mac Mini at home, where it behaves OK.  <answer6688> I do have a 7200 drive in my Mid-2010 MBP, it's also a Hitachi one (like with @calavera):  precodeHitachi HTS725050A9A362:    Kapazit√§t:    500.11 GB (500'107'862'016 Byte)   Modell:   Hitachi HTS725050A9A362                    Version:  PC4ACB1E   Native Command Queuing:   Ja   Queue Depth:  32   Wechselmedien:    Nein   Absteckbares Laufwerk:    Nein   BSD-Name: disk0   Rotationsrate:    7200   Medientyp:    Rotierend /code/pre  It a quiet drive, like the entire computer.  <answer6689> when I bought mine, I selected the strong320Gb/strong 7200rpm, and never look at 500GB as I always said to me that, for big space, NAS Server or External 1/2Tb would be the best option, as when I'm moving, strongI really don't need that much space/strong, only when I'm at desk.  So, instead, I upgraded to a 240Gb SSD from MacSales (OWC), and ... WOW, what a speed! what a thrill to use this drive! no sound, no moving peaces, faster as you can dream.  See here a normal drive (HHD) versus an SSD booting up  emimage below/em blue drive is the SSD drive, outside drive is the WD Scorpio Blue 320Gb  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EaFcJ.jpg" alt="alt text"  then I also bough a 2,5'' Bus powered enclosure to put my 320Gb native drive as now I use to keep my recent stuff including photos.  alt text http://www.balexandre.com/temp/2011-01-20_0847.png  hop it helps.  <comment6656> If you want another safe option, you can upgrade HDD from OWC. Just visit their website (http://www.macsales.com/) to see options. <comment6657> Thanks for the answer! My existing drive is also a Hitachi 5400 RPM drive (and is also very quiet). I did a bit of research and found that a 750 GB option is available (http://goo.gl/MZqg0). The price is good so I'll probably go for it! Thanks again! <comment6658> @garikapati Why is this the safe option? <comment6659> Is the Scorpio Blue a 7200 RPM drive? Thanks. <comment6660> @Kevin: no problem! <comment6661> I meant a proven way on upgrading HDD's in different kinfd of MacBooks. Few friends did upgrade RAM and HDD's form these guys and you can choose based on your exact model. That's why I said safe option. <comment6685> No, it is a 5400 rpm drive. I believe the heat and vibration buildup I experienced with the Seagate was because of the higher rpm. No 5400 rpm drive has given me these issues.
