Color Display are not right <body> I am Robert and have been using macbook Pro for quite sometime. However the color display had been a problem from the time of purchase. I tried different ways to calibrate but to no avail.  Finally tried Colorsync Utility option for repair and first aid. It indicated that the system has 4 bad profiles which the automatic first aid did not fix. The bad profiles are;  Library/Application Support/Adobe/Color/Profiles/RedBlueYellow.icc  Library/Application Support/Adobe/Color/Profiles/smokey.icc  Library/Application Support/Adobe/Color/Profiles/TealMagenta.icc  Library/Application Support/Adobe/Color/Profiles/TotalLinkPreview.icc  I have been regularly updating the OS and now am on Yosemite...  Could someone help me to set it right please.  <answer167608> As you know those are Adobe ICC profiles, thus made by Abode to support they suite of Graphics products.  Some ICC's are specific to a Adobe product you are using and come as part of the installation package.   To find those ICC profiles, look in the original installation package.  In some cases you might see a problem where the ColorSync Utility claims a profile cannot be fixed.   ColorSync utility - Verify and Repair:  In cases where the ColorSync fails to repair a ICC profile, you will need to go to the profile in the Finder, get information on it, and ensure your username is added in the Sharing &amp; Permissions section with both Read and Write privileges.   You can also use Terminal to find them.  precodefind /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/ -name "*.icc" -exec sips --verify {} \; /code/pre  When done, re-run the repair routine, and hopefully that will allow the profile to be fixed.  Or again use Terminal to try to Repair them:  precodefind /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/ -name "*.icc" -exec sips --repair {} \; /code/pre  Here is some more reading material.  <comment196521> the link provided to download the profiles do not assist in downloading for mac. May be it is of window link and not of Mac. <comment196573> Which one (or all) do you use? Creative Suite速 3, Illustrator速 CS3, InDesign速 CS3, or Photoshop速 CS3 <comment197053> Thank you very much for your interest in assisting me. Unfortunate that I could not get back immediately to respond to your question. I use all but CS6... not CS3. Thank you
