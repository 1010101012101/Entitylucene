How do I remove a device from a free (un-enrolled) team provisioning profile? <body> I'm writing a React Native app for iOS and Android. After building the project through Xcode onto three different (physical) devices, the product owner wanted a version for testing on his personal iPhone as well. Now, when building to his device, Xcode simply spits out a few red lines, which seem to occur from the same error:     Unable to add device (device-name-here) because the team has already   reached the maximum number of iPhone devices.   Then something about that the build can't commence, because the device is not registered in the team profile etc.  strongI realize I'm using a free provisioning profile, but I was not warned about the device limitation beforehand, which makes me think I can change which devices are connected to the profile somehow. Am I misunderstanding something? Or how do I go about doing this?/strong  As of now, I won't have access to an enrolled developer account, so I'm having to make do with a free one. This is my first time working with Apple software, coming from a long streak of Android development and open source software.  <answer278203> The free developer program has a 3 device limit. To increase the number of devices, you'll need to purchase a membership, which will increase the limit to 100. You can only reset your list of registered devices on your annual renewal cycle.
