How can I "delete" the last word, using iOS dictation feature? <body> iOS dictation is a great feature, which mostly works both for Siri and for apps supporting an onscreen keyboard.  However: is there a voice command I can use to backspace or delete the last word?  I found a good guide here, but there is no delete command: http://www.siriuserguide.com/siri-dictation-guide/  <answer219491> It doesn't seem like it is possible.  The closest I have seen is to use 'shake to undo' which will then select your entire last phrase/sentence. It's then possible to adjust that selection &amp; delete as required.  Not what you wanted, I'm aware.  <answer276566> "delete this" works for me using mac dictation  <answer277885> just figured it out, you have to say "select word" and then say "delete that".. its working for me !  <comment266378> There are some "editing" commands you can tell Siri, e.g., saying "new line" will cause Siri to move to the next line -- but I haven't found anything for deleting the last word either. <comment348158> The question is about iOS dictation. <comment370205> It doesn't work for me (iOS 10). It just writes the words literally
