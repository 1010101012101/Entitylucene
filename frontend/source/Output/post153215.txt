MacBook Pro Retina Hanging on White Boot Screen <body> My 15" MacBook Pro Retina has an issue that, on startup, the initial all-white screen shows in conjunction with the start-up chime and remains there for several seconds (up to 15-20 in extreme cases).  When I originally purchased the product, it would only take about 3-5 seconds for the Apple logo to appear and for the boot to continue.  Are there any steps I can take to cut down on the time the system spends on this all-white start-up screen?  <answer153251> There could be a number of reasons to cause this:  ul liAmount of storage/li liThe age/li litorrented applications or files. /li /ul  These are just the main ones, of course there is others. Try cleaning out your mac!   Note: I am not accusing you of torrenting application!  <answer154592> Resetting my MacBook's PRAM returned the boot times to normal.
