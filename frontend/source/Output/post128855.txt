Remove McAfee Safe Search bar <body> The McAfee Safe Search bar is not aesthetically pleasing, and will never be used by me, is it possible to remove it from the Safari browser, while keeping McAfee and its internet security benefits?  <answer128890> Try this:  Open a terminal, and type:  codecd /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/code  codels/code  Does it show "something something McAfee"?  If yes, try moving it somewhere else (to be able to restore it later, if something goes wrong), replace codeMcAfeeFooBar/code with the actual name (you can press tab to complete the name):  codemv McAfeeFooBar ~//code  codekillall Safari/code  and start Safari again. If the Toolbar is gone and McAfee still works, you're done!  If you get something along the lines of "permission denied" while trying the codemv/code command, prepend it by codesudo/code and enter your password when requested.  If this doesn't lead to the desired effect, or McAfee breaks, revert your changes by typing  codecd/code  codemv McAfeeFooBar /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins//code,  again prepending the codemv/code command with codesudo/code if necessary.
