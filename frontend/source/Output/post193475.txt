increase font for all apps/menus in mac <body> Is there an app to increase/change default fontsize for all applications in mac ?br It is really painful for me to read default fonts or to increase fontsize in every app I open, and even worse, the fontsize in many menus(as well as Finder match results) can not be modified!  <comment230650> Did you try the Accessibility options for Zoom ? <comment230655> Yes, I did. As the word 'zoom' implies, it does not increase the fontsize. Even worse, 'Accessibility-Zoom' destroys all the layout. <comment230656> So you do not want to zoom in, just increase the font and that system wide. <comment230657> You are right, I simply want all texts to be larger. <comment230658> It is not simple at all, otherwise there would be a user control for it.
