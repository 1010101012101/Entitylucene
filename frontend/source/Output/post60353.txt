iTunes total playtime by artist <body> Is there an easy way to extract metadata from iTunes? I want to know how much a certain artist has been played (for each track, playcount * track length.)  <answer60487> You can do it with AppleScript (assuming you're on a Mac). Here's some scrappy code I've knocked together. Open up AppleScript editor, paste this in and run.  precodeset dialog_reply to display dialog "Enter artist name:" default answer "Boards Of Canada"  if text returned of dialog_reply is not "" then     set plays_list to {}     set times_list to {}     set artist_name to text returned of dialog_reply     tell application "iTunes"         try             tell source 1                 tell library playlist 1                     tell (every track whose artist is artist_name)                         set plays_list to played count                         set times_list to time                     end tell                 end tell             end tell         on error             display alert "Couldn't find anything by " &amp; artist_name as warning         end try     end tell      if length of plays_list is greater than 0 then         set total_time_minutes to 0         set total_time_seconds to 0         repeat with i from 1 to (length of times_list)             set this_time to (item i of times_list)             set text item delimiters to ":"             set time_elements to every text item of this_time             set this_minutes to item 1 of time_elements             set this_seconds to item 2 of time_elements             if item i of plays_list is greater than 0 then                 set total_time_minutes to total_time_minutes + (this_minutes)                 set total_time_seconds to total_time_seconds + (this_seconds)             end if         end repeat          set total_time_minutes to total_time_minutes + (total_time_seconds div 60)         set total_time_seconds to (total_time_seconds mod 60)          if total_time_minutes is greater than 0 or total_time_seconds is greater than 0 then             if length of (total_time_seconds as string) is less than 2 then set total_time_seconds to "0" &amp; total_time_seconds as string             display alert "You've played " &amp; artist_name &amp; " for " &amp; total_time_minutes &amp; "m " &amp; total_time_seconds &amp; "s." as informational         else             display alert "Looks like you haven't played anything by " &amp; artist_name &amp; " yet?" as warning         end if      end if end if /code/pre  <answer61324> There's an app in the Mac App Store called mySpins that gives you all kinds of info like that: play counts, total play time, etc.
