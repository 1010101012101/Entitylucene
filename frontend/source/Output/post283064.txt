App not working, binary working <body> I have a Wine app that allows me to run a windows game on a mac. However for some reason, if I open the app directly, the binary file within opens, but it does not seem to run as intended and doesn't do its "magic" of running the exe file.   However if I go inside the package contents of the app, through code/Contents/MacOS/WineskinLauncher/code (where the WineskinLauncher is the set Executable File to be opened as shown in the Info.plist) and double-click that binary, it actually does it's job of running the windows exe program (along with opening a Terminal window first). Confused as to why this happens, I went to Activity Monitor to see what files and ports were being opened and I found some similarities and oddities.
