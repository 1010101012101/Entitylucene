MacBook Pro Retina not booting with charged battery <body> My MacBook Pro retina mid-2012 fails to boot when the battery has charge, I don't see the Apple symbol or hear the standard startup chime. It boots perfectly fine with a totally drained battery while connected via the AC.  The battery reports normal condition with 364 cycles (Apple replaced in early 2015).  Has anyone seen this, and what was the fix? It looks to me like it's the battery failing or a damaged ribbon cable.  Edit: OSX just reported codeAGC GPU REGISTER RESTORE FAILED/code after a panic. https://gist.github.com/ElijahGlover/3d9c8c4e36389933bc2494c55924869d  <comment359357> Apple repaired under VST - Macbook Pro 2012
