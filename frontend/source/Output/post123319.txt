Sending and receiving text messages (SMS) over iPhone 5 with Bluetooth from Win7 <body> I have tried to connect my iPhone via bluetooth to my Windows 7 PC.  After following some suggestions online, I updated the Broadcomm drivers from here: http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php  The iPhone now connects, and I was surprised to find an interface for sending messages (MAP MAS-iOS)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDlzc.gif" alt="Exposed bluetooth services"  As well as the option to connect to the device to send SMS messages:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ihjn6.gif" alt="Available phone operations (iPhone 5S)"   When I pressed Connect I got a functional little interface that shows the battery and reception of my phone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LijIE.gif" alt="SMS Editor"  However, when I try to send a text it keeps disconnecting. I can't identify any specific errors.  Has anyone managed to get text messaging via iPhone to work? I couldn't find anything online that shows success (or failure) and I feel like I am very close...  <answer124325> The iPhone doesn't support sending text messages over bluetooth (for security purposes according to apple).  <comment147804> So why does it publish that interface? For example, it doesn't publish a file sharing interface... <comment148022> http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3647 Message Access Profile allows devices to exchange messages. It's mostly used for automotive hands-free use. <comment148442> I don't think I understand: doesn't that contradict your answer? <comment148490> It can read, but not send afaik
