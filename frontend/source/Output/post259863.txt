How dou you connect to a Windows IPC$ with MacOS <body> Once upon a time, OSX had samba, so you could do this:  precode smbclient -W domain //pc-233/ipc\$ -U admin -c '' 2&gt;&amp;1 /code/pre  and it would tell you the remote OS or you could run other commands.  This doesn't seem possible with smbutil, and I don't see anything like rpcclient either. I checked homebrew and I don't see any replacements.   What replacements exist?  <comment325185> What are you trying to accomplish, exactly?  If you fill out more detail, it might be possible without doing this. <comment325187> basically re-implement enum4linux.pl - https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/
