Cannot seem to download command line tools <body> I'm trying to download and install Command Line Tools for my Mac through Xcode, but it is not in the downloads section like youtube videos tell me to go. So, I manually download it and install it, and it still does not show up. I need this so I can download MacPorts. Any suggestions on how to get it? Or how to see if I already have it? Thanks!  <answer127032> strongRun codexcode-select --install/code/strong  This will prompt you to download and install the CLTs using softwareupdate.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0E7Xt.png" width="575"  <comment148788> When I do that, I get a dialog box that comes up and says "Cant install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server <comment148789> @user38508 Do you have a custom software update server set? Is the machine under MDM? Is your account a network account through OS X Server? Try resetting your softwareupdate server: `sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL` <comment148790> To be honest, I have no idea what any of that means. lol. I'm a Mac Noob. I know the ins and out of windows because that is what I grew up on and have developed on. But I have recently switched over to Mac, and have no idea what anything is. lol <comment148791> @user38508 Then your answer is probably no :) Try the reset command to reset the server address to make sure it really is calling Apple. <comment148796> Ugh. One problem after another. Hopefully we can get this worked out. When I run the reset command, it says this: "Domain (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate) not found. Defaults have not been changed."
