Execute a custom script when OS X 10.8 is in Power nap? <body> Apple new feature of OS X 10.8 in new Macs "Power Nap" checks email and does make backups.  Is it possible to execute a strongcustom script/strong (bash, AppleScript,...) when OS X 10.8 is in Power nap mode? For example pull a git repository or download files.  <answer81820> As far as I know, it's strongnot/strong possible.   The reason is that emPower Nap/em doesn't have an API that 3rd party apps can hook into (so apps could trigger a wake event or be notified when one occurs).  Whether this will remain like that in the future depends upon Apple. It would be interesting to see if there's a simple way to detect when one is in empower nap/em mode, but doesn't seem to be available emafaik/em.   If you leave a script that pulls from git every minute, in theory, since emPower Nap/em is really a power on without graphics and audio state, maybe it would get executed (if it was running before). emuntested/em.
