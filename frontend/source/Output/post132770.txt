How do I remove the strip above my menu bar? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZr75.png" alt="."  Recently a strip has appeared above the menu bar on my mac and I have no idea how to get rid of it. Any ideas? The above photograph of the problem is screen shotted.   <answer132771> That looks the the desktop wallpaper. Try changing wallpaper (or display type; it might be due to the aspect ratio).  <comment157223> It appears that was the problem, silly me! Thank you so much for your help!
