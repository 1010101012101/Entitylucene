Macbook Pro 2011 screen keep flickering <body> I have a MacBook Pro 2011. I have go to Authorized Apple Service to  fix this issue on 2014.  Unfortunately it happen again now. I did troubleshooting by remove the driver from extensions folder (nvidia kext file) and success to make this MacBook life (or half) once again.  But it really annoyed now. Everytime i open app launcher, website, any app. The display keep scanning with white lines.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WFzYv.jpg" alt="scanning"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FORHX.jpg" alt="scanning 2"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4pn0e.jpg!" alt="scanning 3"  It's fine when website/app load completely.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s7fcA.jpg" alt="fine"  strongIs there anything I can do to solve this?/strong  Or it will be permanent.  As I believe, I can't go to apple one more time to fix discreet GPU for free.  <comment344987> I don't know what a "screen screening" is.  Can you post a photo? <comment344988> I'm sorry @Allan. Just edit it to "Scanning" instead of screening. And i add one photo. Can't add more photos right now. <comment344990> I am assuming you mean the distortion at the bottom right.  However, it also appears that your screen is cracked, is this the case? <comment344991> Yes, the glass are broken but the Screen/LCD not. Since I remove AMD driver (force to using Dedicated GPU). It always scanning anything you want to see and it keeps scanning when mouse on any website elements. But it's fine when you just do nothing. <comment345017> My symptoms were a bit different (rainbow vertical bars across the screen). I have same model Macbook, I took it to Apple store and they replaced my GPU and motherboard for free because that model and year had a defect. Worth looking into... just make sure it's not software causing the issue... which you could do a fresh install of your OS to check. <comment345042> @KolobCanyon Sorry about your MBP too. I did go to local Apple and they fix it on 2014 (five month before the program expired on 2015). Unfortunately, it happens again. Yup, I did. Try to clean install with Yosemite on other apple HDD. Can't make it to install progress after "optionbootable usb". <comment345071> Crap man. You may be toasted unless you are willing to attempt to replace the motherboard. There are videos out there to try
