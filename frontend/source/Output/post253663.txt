Changing display color profiles easily <body> Is there a way to easily switch display color profiles, instead of going to System Preferences  Displays  Color  Display Profile?  It doesn't seem to be AppleScript-able. There used to be a menu-bar utility called ProfileMenu, but it no longer works in macOS Sierra, and is no longer supported.  You can get the selected profile using AppleScript, but it's read-only, so you can't set it:  precodetell application "Image Events"   get display profile of display 1 end tell /code/pre  <answer253667> I found a little tool called customdisplayprofiles, which lets you switch profiles by running a command like codecustomdisplayprofiles set /path/to/profile.icc/code. I put that into a shell script in code~/Library/Scripts//code, and now I can switch profiles from the menu bar again. You can find the .icc files in code/Library/ColorSync/Profiles//code and code~/Library/ColorSync/Profiles//code.
