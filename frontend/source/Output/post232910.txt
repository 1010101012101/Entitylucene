Convert .mov to .mp4 <body> I want to convert code.mov/code to code.mp4/code! I saved the video from iMovie but it is in code.mov/code format! How do I convert it to code.mp4/code?

HandBrake is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.      Reasons youâ€™ll love HandBrake:      ul   liConvert video from nearly any format/li   liFree and Open Source/li   liMulti-Platform (Windows, Mac and Linux)/li   /ul   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L4YQb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer271619> Apple's gotcha covered.  You can use strongQuickTime Player/strong to export .mov files and have them converted to .m4v files that will play on your other Apple products. M4V is a video container format developed by Apple from the MP4 standard - M4V is very similar to the MP4 format. The main difference is that M4V supports DRM copy protection - such as for copyrighted material viewed with Apple TV.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lOGui.png" alt="enter image description here"  There's also a "Share" option in the player when you open a .mov file in QuickTime Player:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kn4Rp.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...and I am not sure if this converts the file, but you can use it to send your video to your mobile device with, for example, the Messages app.    See this article for more information on the difference between MP4 and M4V.    Lastly, per this tutorial, you can just Export the file from iMovie:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sh7h5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kj0ww.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer271633> I personally find using codeffmpeg/code shell program (available through Brew using codebrew install ffmpeg/code) the most convenient way to do the conversions.  It includes tons of options for nearly any single thing you could possibly do with a movie.  strongIn your case though, for a conversion, you can simply type:/strong  strongcodeffmpeg -i /path/to/input/file /path/to/output.mp4/code/strong  The code.mp4/code extension in the output path serves as a cue for the program to do the proper conversion -- no more options are necessary.  <answer278245> You can also use VLC to convert .mov into several formats:  ol liInstall and open VLC/li liGo to "File"  "Convert / Stream..."/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OV8w4.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liLoad the video (for example drag the .mov file into box)/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6N4D5.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="4" liChoose the format you want/li liClick on "Save as File" button, sit back and relax/li /ol  <answer284656> Which iPhone models who you own? The iPhone can only play H.264 or MPEG-4 video. The most simple way is downloading Handbrake, which not only assists you to convert MOV to iPhone suppported H.264 or MPEG-4 video, but also offers advanced profile parameters adjusting function to assist you to get better output video and audio quality.  <comment284685> [related](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/17727/55266) <comment284699> Does Handbrake also offer the option to rewrap video / put .mov to .mp4 or vice versa without transcoding/re-compressing the video/audio data? <comment284702> @DictionaricsAnonymous I am not sure. Consdier asking a [new question here on Ask Different](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) or on the [Handbrake forum](https://forum.handbrake.fr). <comment369858> This is awesome
