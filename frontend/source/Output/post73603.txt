DNS Problem: My website loads a spammy page when i visit from my computer, but works fine on my phone and other computers <body> I have tried visiting http://getridofit.com from my mac using Chrome and Safari.  Both times it loads this page: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kRvsn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  When I visit from any other computer I get the normal website.  Is this a DNS problem with my mac?  Did I get some sort of malware?  How do I fix this?    Many Thanks.  <comment85499> It looks like something is likely hijacking the DNS. Please list what DNS servers appear in **System Preferences → Network → Wi-Fi *(or Ethernet, whichever your primary interface is)* → Advanced → DNS**. Then list the contents of the `/etc/hosts` file. <comment85500> This could be caused by browser extensions too. Try disabling all extensions. <comment85502> robmathers 192.168.1.1 is the DNS Server.  I dont see the /etc/hosts/    @Gerry this is happening across multiple browsers.  I did try disabling every Chrome extension and that did not help. <comment85543> 192.168.1.1 is your router. Can you login to that and look up the DNS server there? Or run `dig www.apple.com` in Terminal and take note of the SERVER line (close to the end of the output)? <comment85725> @patrix I logged into the router and it says the DNS is: 68.105.28.12 68.105.29.12  When i run the command in terminal it says ;; SERVER: 192.168.1.1#53(192.168.1.1) <comment85834> The IP addresses starting with 68 seem to be DNS servers by Cox, is this your ISP? As for the output in the SERVER line, it seems normal, the computer is using the router as DNS server and the router is connecting to the DNS servers starting with 68. Several things you can try: try to restart the router, it would flush the DNS cache. Try to connect another device (that doesn't have DNS servers set in the network preferences) to the router.If the same thing happens with another device, the problem is not with your computer, but the DNS servers or the router. <comment85836> More things to try: if you have a cellphone that allows tethering, connect the computer to it and see if this fixes the issue. If the computer is portable, connect it to a different router at another location, preferably with different ISP. Also, try to change the router's DNS servers to Google's or OpenDNS (list of public DNS servers: http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/a/free-public-dns-servers.htm) <comment86080> @lupinhco Cox is my home ISP.  I have connected my computer to my office router with a different ISP and the same thing keeps happening.  I have tried different computers on the office network and they get to the website perfectly. <comment86272> So it seems that it is a DNS issue with your computer only. Earlier you said that you don't see `/etc/hosts`, what do you mean by that -- that there is no such file or you can't find it?  If there is no such file, that's a problem as it should be there.
