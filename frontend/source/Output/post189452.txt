How to show a "temp" slide during bullets animation in keynote <body> Sorry if this question sounds stupid, but I haven't found any answer.  I know I can animate a bulleted-list in keynote so it strongappears by bullet/strong, one by one. Can I insert a full-screen slide (picture or something) in the middle of this animation?  Like this.  ol liShow bullet #1/li liShow bullet #2/li liShow a full-screen slide/li liShow bullet #3/li /ol  The only solution I can think of - is to create two duplicate slides and a picture-slide in between.  PS. Adding "links" to other slide won't help since I only have a "next" button during the presentation, no mouse/kbd/touchscreen  <answer189456> Make two text boxes, the first with bullets 1 and 2 and the second with bullet 3. Then add an entrance and exit effect for the picture in between the entrances of the two text boxes.  <comment293671> I'm tornâ€”creating duplicate slides means more text to update if you need to make changes, but putting everything on one slide (e.g. futzing with build order and build-in/build-out so the full-slide picture is on top of everything, but only when it should be shown) means the image covers everything while I'm editing slides.
