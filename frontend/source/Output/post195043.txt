Access emails from Time Machine backups of old machine <body> Killed my old MacBook in November last year, and was able to access everything I needed for the new MacBook Pro using Time Machine, apart from emails. This Time Machine drive now has backups for the new MacBook Pro, so when I open Time Machine from within Mail it only shows me the emails from the MacBook Pro, and not the old MacBook.  Any suggestions as to how I can find the old emails?  <answer195046> I would try importing the old emails goto mails file menu- import mailboxes navigate to to the backup device, locate the old backup folder and navigate to users/{ussername}/library/mail/v2/mailboxes and import the mail
