Do generic brand Lightning-to-30-pin adapters work for charging, music and syncing? <body> I'm hesitant to fork over â‚¬29 to continue using my existing iPod sound dock with a 5th gen Touch. I've found some generic brand Lightning-to-30-pin adapters on Amazon and eBay at much lower prices, but I don't know if they work at all. I'd use them for charging, audio playback and syncing.  What are your experiences with this specific adapter in terms of quality and function as compared to Apple's adapter?  <comment84818> Asking about all generic adapters in bulk seems like a very broad target and highly subjective. It also won't help people that see this question in 6 or 16 months to know what we are discussing now. Let's remove the speculation and solidify what specific device you want to work with and compare a specific Apple part with a specific third party device. <comment84820> I have an [Altec Lansing Moondance Home](http://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-M302-Moondance-Home/dp/B001GKE2RA) as well as an [Altec Lansing inMotion IM3C](http://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-inMotion-Portable-System/dp/B0006G0RSI/) at home. The latter could charge my 1st gen touch, but not my 3rd gen touch. The former can charge both.
