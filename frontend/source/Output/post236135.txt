Apple Watch no longer displays temperature <body> Since I installed the most recent Apple Watch software version (early April, 2016) the temperature no longer appears on the watch face (-- appears), yet when I press the temperature (on the Apple Watch), it successfully loads the weather channel data.  Why does the temperature no longer appear on the watch face?  <answer236138> ul liDo you have a location set up in Weather for iOS?/li liIs your watch connected to iPhone or WiFi?/li /ul  Those are two reasons why it may not show correctly.  <answer236146> I've had this issue and I did the following:  ol liRestarting by holding down both the Digital Crown and Friends button./li liRestoring Apple Watch from iTunes or iCloud backup/li liErasing and setting Apple Watch up as new/li /ol  I hope 1 or 2 works for you, because I unfortunately had to set it up as new.  <answer258014> I did restart, but still did not work. I opened my weather app on iPhone and that fixed the problem. The weather app seems buggy with the latest update.  <answer286980> Make sure the Weather App is open on the Apple Watch. I had Location set up properly and was connected to Wifi. Opening the app on the watch did it for me.   <comment288914> Thanks for the quick response.  Location is set up properly and watch is connected to iPhone.  Still no temperature appears on watch face. <comment362259> This answer is the same as a previous answer.
