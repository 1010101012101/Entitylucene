Is S/MIME in iOS 7 buggy? <body> I recently imported my S/MIME certificate into iOS 7. I am able to read signed/encrypted message sent from my mac to the iPhone.  BUT  I am UNABLE to send signed / encrypted mails from the iPhone.  This is strange:  ul liFirst I open the Mail app and start composing a mail. Immediately I see that the messages will be send encrypted (according hint in the app). But how can the app know, that it will send encrypted mail BEFORE I entered a recipient?/li liAlso, as soon as I tap into one of the fields (CC, BCC, etc) the hint "encrypted" disappears/li liI am not able to encrypt / sign mails/li /ul  Pretty complicated to describe. Any similar experiences? Buggy?  <answer123215> The mail can only be encrypted as long as the recipient als uses S/MIME encryption and the mail client knows the recipient's public key. As long as you do not meet that requirements, your mail will be signed, will include a public key, but will not be encrypted.  <answer127394> You need to have, installed on your iPhone, the public key of the person you intend to send an encrypted message to.  Mail.app on OS X imports the certificates of people who send you mail, automatically. On iOS, you have to do it manually, unless your iPhone is part of a corporate deployment.  It's easy! Simply find an email the recipient has sent to you, tap the checkmark icon next to their name, tap "view certificate", and tap "install".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0qTAn.png" alt="&quot;Signed&quot; indicator"
