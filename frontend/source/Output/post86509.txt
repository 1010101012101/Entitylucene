Is there an app to convert a video to HTML / JS / JSON? <body> Apple's site does some neat tricks on their pages to display videos encoded as a JPG file and then decoded and rendered in a canvas element (see http://www.tuaw.com/2012/10/16/how-apples-iphone-5-website-works/).  Is there an app that will take a video and convert it into that?  I remember seeing something like that announced, but can't find any reference or link on my notes.  <answer86719> I found one such app: Phosphor  It does what I required.  <comment100240> Also spelled **Phosphor**
