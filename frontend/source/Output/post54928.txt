Trackpad firmware doesn't update and now stopped working (Lion & MacBook 13" Unibody) <body> I bought an oldish MacBook 13" Unibody (late 2008) and when I got it one of the first things I did was to install Mac OS X Lion.  Everything was working fine, until I applied an update that made the trackpad stop working (it only accepts clicks, no touch is recognized).  This is the "Trackpad Firmware Update" from the automatic updates.  When starting this firmware update a window appears with a status message,  codeCancel/code and codeUpdate/code buttons. After clicking the codeUpdate/code button, it starts installing, appears to complete, status changes to codeFinishing.../code, and codeUpdate/code button comes back active at some point.  After that I have tried (unsuccessfully):  ul lidownloading and installing the update directly from Apple Support - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3288/li lisame thing, but using the 'root' account /li lileaving the computer on overnight to see if actually "finished" the process/li liReset PRAM PVRAM - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379/li liReset SMC - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964/li liHand palm pressing over 30 seconds on the trackpad (read this on another thread...?)/li liReinstalling Mac OS X Lion using a DVD/li liIndifferent to USB devices being connected or not/li /ul  I'd be thankful for any ideas to try out.  <answer55501> Ended up taking it to an apple technician and they fixed it...  <comment65562> I tried applying this patch with Mac OS X Snow Leopard, with little success. Behavior is similar to installing in Lion... <comment73159> No one has any ideas on things to try...?
