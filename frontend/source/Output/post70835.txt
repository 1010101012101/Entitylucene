How do I rename desktops in Mountain Lion? <body> It seems that Apple doesn't provide a way to rename desktops from the default "Desktop 1", etc. Renaming desktops would be great for my workflow.  Does anyone know how to do this manually or with a third-party app?  <answer70836> If an application is in full screen mode in a given space, that space will have the application's name under it when it is displayed via Mission Control (and you put your mouse cursor over the desktop). Otherwise, I do not believe that there is a way to rename them.  <comment82332> Hmmm... I'm aware of that functionality but unfortunately what I'm trying to do is to name a 'workspace' on a dual-screen, which has windows from several different applications occupying various parts of the screens. I was hoping there would be a third-party app that could do this.
