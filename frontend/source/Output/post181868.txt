I can't shrink my OS X Yosemite partition <body> I recently reformatted my machine and am trying to shrink my OS X partiton to make room for a linux partition, following instructions at http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/ . I am at the Resize Partitions step, and when I opened up Disk Utility, there was no way for me to drag the existing partition to shrink its size and create free space.  When looking at the GUI, the normal resize handle is missing, and the help text sounds much more restrictive than it has in the past.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5h93.png" alt="Resize handle missing and odd text."  <answer181876> The steps you linked skip a crucial point - you have to actually create a second partition. I think it's assuming you already have a second partition that you want to format for installing Linux.  In Disk Utility:  ol liClick on the hard drive on the left. Note that each drive has (at least) two lines: an identifier, such as "251 GB APPLE SSD SD02...", and a partition name which is Macintosh HD by default. Click on the drive identifier, not the partition name, in order to be able to partition the drive./li liClick the Partition tab on the right side./li liClick the + at the bottom of the partition list. (Screenshot 1 below)/li liClick on the new partition and enter a name. (Screenshot 2, #1 on image)/li liChoose the size of the new partition either by dragging the divider between the two, or by entering a size in the Size box. (Screenshot 2, #2 on image) Note that the purple shaded area in your original partition is used space, so that partition cannot be made any smaller than that./li liClick Apply to make changes./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2LwQ.png" alt="Screenshot 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B3l1h.png" alt="Screenshot 2"  <answer181892> There is a very simple reason for the lack of a resize handle on your current drive. Notice, in your screen shot, that in the left hand pane you have a disk labelled "Macintosh HD" which also has a volume labelled "Macintosh HD". With the disk highlighted, look at the bottom of the window and you can see that the disk is of the type "Logical Volume Group".  Now, if we look at @tubedogg's screenshots, in the left hand pane we can see the serial and make of his hard drive (a 1TB Western Digital HDD) which has a volume labelled "Ted" (I'm going off the top-most drive here). The bottom of the window tells us that the drive is an independent drive connected internally via SATA. Perhaps you can already see where I am going with this?  @qmlowery, it seems that you have a Fusion drive, and not a typical HDD layout, am I correct? If not, you say that you recently reformatted, so I'm guessing you created a Core Storage volume on your disk. These act differently to regularly connected drives. Imagine, if you will, that there was a resize handle for your Fusion Drive. You drag the handle to create 20GB of free space (in which you could put another partition or something). Where is that 20GB of free space located? On the 32GB of Solid State storage? Or on the remaining space which is conventional storage?  For this reason, resizing is not available on a logical volume group. OS X wouldn't know where to cut out the free space. In order to install your linux partition, you will need to ignore the steps that tell you to resize the partition, and instead just create a partition of the specified size using the "+" button.  Hope this clarifies things for you and helps you out. :)  Source: My time fixing custom Fusion Drives at an AASP. :P  EDIT: There's a lovely in-depth article on CoreStorage here.  <answer181898> Essentially you have a CoreStorage Volume Group instead of an old-style partition scheme. You shouldn't use Disk Utility to modify the CSVG.  To shrink your CoreStorage Volume Group to get some unallocated space to install Linux or EFI-Windows just use an undocumented diskutil command:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size /code/pre  The command expands or shrinks the whole CoreStorage Volume Group including the physical volume(s), the logical volume family and the logical volume in one step to the desired size.  emBeware: The command is vastly undocumented and as such potentially destructive./em  strongPreparation:/strong    ul liBackup your data./li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.

When comparing your first screenshot to mine, I do not have the resize handle, and the text underneath the Size section sounds much more restrictive. I'll update my post with a screenshot. <comment216355> I believe it was possible in 10.9 to resize a single partition (at least based on screenshots I found). However, in 10.10, you have to click the + first to create a new partition and then tell it what size it should be. I'm not sure why you can only split yours into two (as opposed to more), but if you follow the steps in my post, it will work correctly. <comment216381> The steps aren't missing. Look to your first screenshot. You have a resize handle (the triangular lines in the corner) for your partition whereas @qmlowery doesn't. I've explained why in my answer. <comment216391> This is an awesome explanation, but the OP has a core storage logical volume instead of a bare drive. Look in the lower left of your and OP screenshots for this breadcrumb of importance. <comment216447> I have all of my data backed up from before I reformatted recently anyways. How would I revert back to the old-style partition scheme? I don't know what step in reformatting I would have done incorrectly to cause this. <comment216483> @qmlowery added revert to old-style volume
