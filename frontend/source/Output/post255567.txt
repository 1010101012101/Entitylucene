"Save as ..." in Microsoft Office always brings up "Documents" folder in Finder <body> "Save as ..." ignores the location of the current file and ignores the last save location. This means I have to navigate back to the original files source folder every time I want to save a different version of the file in Excel.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5BVSp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer255579> This sounds more like a complaint than a question. Or a feature request. You can log feature requests for Office 365 on Uservoice. https://office365.uservoice.com/  There are also separate uservoice sites for the individual Office applications.   Make a feature request. People vote for it. Microsoft uses these votes to prioritize which features to implement.  <answer255692> Microsoft lets you set the default location of documents:  Preferences - File Location  Select which you want to change and point it to the right folder  <answer274215> Many apps do this. Years ago a utility was released called DefaultFolderX. It lets you fix this problems for all apps, and even have two different locations- one for open, one for save.  It is unlikely that Microsoft will do anything about this function as they would regard it as the operating system's responsibility.  <comment318345> Documents by default go into the Documents directory. Use numbers, you wont have this issue, mS aren't oriented around Ease of use as much as Apple . <comment318506> Unfortunately this doesn't address my desire to have the file save location adapt to the original files location or the previous save location <comment318508> What do you mean by use numbers? <comment318509> It's only a complaint if the feature doesn't exist... Something I wasn't aware of when posing the question. <comment318521> Sorry, try in Apple's Numbers App.
