How can I stop Mac Mail continually caching attachments? <body> Two problems really:  ol liI'm using Mac Mail version 5.3 on Mac OSX. My Yahoo mailbox is continually fetching new mail i.e. the wheel by 'yahoo is continually spinning. It has been doing this for a few days. I have already tried quitting and reopening Mac mail a few times./li liI can see see from WindowActivity that Yahoo inbox is caching attachments. Even if I stop it, it starts again within seconds./li /ol  <answer108440> In Preferences, within Mail, in the strongAccounts/strong tab, for each of your accounts there is an strongAdvanced/strong tab.  There is an option called strongKeep copies for offline viewing/strong which is a drop-down box. By Choosing strongAll messages, but omit attachments/strong, you can set it to never cache the attachments.
