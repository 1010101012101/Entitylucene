Wallpaper not switching with desktop <body> I have issue with wallpaper. When I am switching desktop, wallpaper is not moving along but "stays under". codekillall Dock/code fixes this but recently it is occurring so often that it became annoying.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PYsHD.gif" alt="enter image description here"  What could be issue? Is there permanent solution?  <answer281395> It's not obvious to me why the codekillall Dock/code command would help with this, but since it does it may be worth you doing a reset and restart of the Dock.  strongReset and restart the Dock/strong  If you go ahead with resetting and restarting the Dock you will need to re-add any non-default icons to your Dock. (I usually find it's a good opportunity for people to start afresh and only add things as they actually use them).  To reset and restart the Dock follow these steps:  ul liGo to Finder/li liPress and hold the kbdoption/kbd key down/li liNow go to the Go menu/li liSelect the Library option to open the User's emLibrary/em folder. You can let go of the kbdoption/kbd key now./li liGo to the Preferences folder (i.e. within the Library folder)/li liFind and move the strongcom.apple.dock.plist/strong file to the Trash/li liNow open Terminal (usually located in Applications  Utilities)/li liEnter this command codekillall -KILL Dock/code/li liPress kbdenter/kbd/li /ul  Remember you'll need to re-add some apps back to the Dock.  If this doesn't resolve your issue, it'd be worth also testing what happens when you're booted into Safe Mode and afterwards again. See below.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. switch desktops and take note of what happens with your Desktop Background)/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li liSwitch desktops again and take note of what happens with your Desktop Background/li /ol  Once you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went.  <answer287600> It took me some time to resolve it but I noticed relation between my issue and this BUG appearing in system.log:  precodeJun 20 09:32:48 myhost Dock[81166]: BUG in libdispatch client: kevent[EVFILT_MACHPORT] monitored resource vanished before the source cancel handler was invoked /code/pre  Moreover I noticed connection between bug occurrences and my tasks performed. Bug was appearing only when I was using Sublime Text 3. I changed it for another code editor and since then I did not have this issue.  <comment354070> Thank you! I will try first reset and restart of Dock. If it will not help I will check this issue in Safe Mode.
