IOS 9.1 Mail no longer recognises PKI certs for signing and encryption <body> I have upgraded from an iPhone 4 to an iPhone 6 and my IOS to 9.1.  Mail works fine from IMAP seveers, but Mail no longer recognises the PKI certificate I have installed.  The certificate is valid and works fine on my MAC using Thunderbird, and worked fine on my iPhone 4.  This is a serious problem as for years I have signed all my e-mails  <comment257478> Deleted the Profile. Re-installed the Cert.  Still does not work
