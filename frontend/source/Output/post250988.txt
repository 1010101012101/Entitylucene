How to install GIMP resynthesizer on Mac OS? <body> I'm running El Capitain and have GIMP installed but can't figured out how to install the resynthesizer. I copied the files from the linux version of the plugin into the plugin folder of GIMP but GIMP does not seem to detect it.  <answer291525> Several things I had to work out. First is make sure you are in your usr Library Gimp folder and not in the Application Contents folder.   Second, after you put any .py in the plugin folder you have to "turn it on". Mac does this to protect you. Open Terminal and go to the folder where the plugin is, then type "chmod u+x " This will give the plugin execute rights. For example "chmod u+x plugin-heal-selection.py". Then start Gimp and it should be there!
