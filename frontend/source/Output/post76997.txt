Transfer music from iPod touch to computer <body> I know there are programs I can download to do this but I have done it before without them. After about an hour of searching I still can't find how I did it. I have Hidden files enabled. "Enable Disk Use" is not available as it is an iPod touch. And while I can transfer purchases most of my music is not purchased from iTunes.  I could have sworn there was a way to do this. I vaguely remember there being lots of folders I had to go through to pull all the music files. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!  <answer153351> Use DeTune :)  http://download.cnet.com/DeTune/3000-2141_4-75289028.html  This way you can transfer music from all iPod, iPhone.  <answer155631> All the answers so far seem to lead to some 35 dollar purchase - for what is all probably the same software in different wrappers....  strongIt can be done for free, quite simply &amp; easily./strong  ul liGet Documents Free from the iTunes store.

In iTunes, select your iPod and select the Summary tab. Make sure "disk use" has been enabled for the iPod. This will allow you to view the iPod's media files from within the Finder.

To do this, double-click the iPod icon. Open the iPod Control folder. Open the Music folder./li liCreate a new folder on the desktop to hold the music files.

Select Add to Library... from the iTunes File menu. Browse to the folder that contains your recovered iPod music. Click the Open button. iTunes will now copy the files to its library. If the step above did not work: your music files may still be in a hidden folder. Although you can see the hidden folders in the finder (they appear as greyed out folders), they are not visible to iTunes during the "Add to library" step above. To fix this issue, simply drag your music files out of the hidden folder into a new folder you create./li liRestore your settings/folders to normal. Delete the music folder you created, if desired. You may delete the music folder you imported into iTunes since by default the "Add to Library" step makes a copy of your music into the iTunes library folder.

As i mentioned in the first sentence i know there are programs to download. Thats not what I'm looking for though. <comment183104> Even though this has already been marked as answered, I have added the definitive **free** method as a new answer.
