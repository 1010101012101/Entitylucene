Why does my OS X still run older php even though I updated it? <body> I have just updated my system php in terminal via command line.  I deleted the export path in .bash_profile as it was pointing to mamp but for some reason my php still says 5.3 not 5.4 when I run codephp -v/code in terminal.  Does anyone know why this would happen. I have also closed terminal and reopened to see the change.  <answer107236> It seems as you did not add the new path to your code$PATH/code.  Citing the FAQ of the website that you have posted:     Why does php -v on the command line still show my old version?      php-osx doesn't overwrite the php binaries installed by Apple, but installs everyting in /usr/local/php5. The new php binary is therefore in /usr/local/php5/bin/php.      You can also adjust your PATH do include that directory, eg. write into your ~/.profile file the following      export PATH=/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH   So open you .profile or .bash_profile in a editor like nano or vim and add the last line codeexport PATH=/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH/code to the appropiate file.  Source your file with codesource ~/.bash_profile/code or codesource ~/.profile/code or close and reopen your terminal.  <comment125738> How did you update php? <comment125739> using this command curl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 5.4 <comment125742> Can you source your .bash_profile manually? In order to do so do the following: `source ~/.bash_profile`. Run `php -v` after that(without closing your terminal). If it still doesn't work please provide your .bash_profile, .profile and a `echo $PATH` please. <comment125743> yes I can source that and this is what I have: <comment125745> `[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function$` <comment125747> The only issue now when I run homebrew `brew doctor` is I get this error: <comment125748> `Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:      /usr/local/php5/bin/curl-config     /usr/local/php5/bin/freetype-config     /usr/local/php5/bin/icu-config     /usr/local/php5/bin/libmcrypt-config     /usr/local/php5/bin/libpng-config     /usr/local/php5/bin/libpng12-config     /usr/local/php5/bin/php-config     /usr/local/php5/bin/xml2-config     /usr/local/php5/bin/xslt-config` <comment125749> Since I can't find any other php package at http://braumeister.org/ I think you can safely ignore this as long you don't add any other taps related to php itself. I may be wrong on this and getting corrected(hopefully) if so. <comment139711> The key for me was exiting and restarting terminal (had already updated .bash_profile and .profile). <comment314203> I had no `.bash_profile` and `.profile` files in my home dir. So I created them by entering `touch .profile` as [stated here](http://redfinsolutions.com/blog/creating-bashprofile-your-mac). I put the `PATH=/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH` in both the files and now `php -v` shows that the newer PHP version (which is 7.0.10).
