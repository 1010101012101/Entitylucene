Little Snitch automatically turning filter off? <body> This issue happens to me in both my rMBP 13 and my Mac Pro. As I understand it, Little Snitch is not applying the rules when the network filter is off:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ABsq4.png" alt="enter image description here"  But why does it turn itself off from time to time? I always have manually to restart the filter.  <answer200387> That's its demo behaviour, it will run for 3 hours then switch off.  Check it thinks it's authorised.br 'Open Little Snitch Preferences...'br Registration tab  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ou9FW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also, as you are running it on 2 computers, ensure you have a separate Registration for each [or a Family License] otherwise if it sees 'itself' on the network it will switch off.  Alternatively, make sure you don't have the on/off toggle key command active &amp; are accidentally hitting it...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fBTvj.png" alt="enter image description here"  You are correct in your assumption that it is not applying the Rules when the Network Filter is off.  <comment241476> A thorough response, thanks. I do have it registered with a single license on each computer: http://i.imgur.com/VVy3f3y.png I checked everything else. Now that you mention it, I think this started when I installed it on the mac pro. Must be a licensing problem. <comment241479> The pricing makes it cheaper to get the Family License even for just 2 machines; so I'd go for that, if that's what it turns out to be.
