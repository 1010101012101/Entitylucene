Cannot sign in iCloud nor iMessage, faceTime on 10.11.1 for upgraded admin account <body> Many people had such issue: https://discussions.apple.com/message/29295728?ac_cid=tw123456#29295728  I notice when upgraded to 10.11.1, I cannot login any iCloud nor iMessage/faceTime account on my old and sole admin account.  I tried to delete ~/Library/Application Support/iCloud/accounts, no luck  I tried to erase NVRAM, no luck  I tried safe mode, no luck  I tried to reset key chain, no luck  I managed to rerun setup assitant and create a new admin account, now I can login to my iCloud.  iCloud always says You can't sign in at this time, try signing in again  iMessage will pop a window ask me again to enter password after I entered it when entering the account name and password, and then says Verification Failed, An unknown error occurred.  Version: 10.11.1  So.. I am desperate, and I think it is supposed to be some broken files for my old admin account, but I don't know what files to be deleted to let OS X to create new files to restore the state.  <comment259873> Try this one - way too much to retype in here - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7272123 <comment259878> no luck.. I also found https://discussions.apple.com/message/29296108?ac_cid=tw123456#29296108, seems same, but the solution in that post does not work too <comment259881> "no luck" ? You didn't have time to do all of that. <comment259905> @Tetsujin I started doing it since yesterday, I just try what I missed in your linkâ€¦
