How do I restore itunes library onto another computer <body> I followed all the steps as suggested for backing up and restore iTunes library in the apple support website: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1751 but I have problems with the 'choose library' part in the last step. I clicked it and located my iTunes Media folder but all that happened was that it just opened the folder and showed me what I have inside and not restore it.  <answer53376> You have to select the iTunes folder you just moved to the internal hard drive, not the iTunes folder currently on your computer.  If you were backing up to a disc, you have to follow these instructions.  <answer90749> I'm just echoing the Apple KB article for anyone else who comes across this answer. I have used this process many times when moving or reformatting my computer:  hr  h2Process for restoring an iTunes library:/h2  ol liQuit iTunes./li liCopy your iTunes folder from your external hard drive to whatever location you desire on your internal hard drive./li liOpen iTunes while holding down the Option key (Mac) or Shift key (Windows)./li liIn the resulting dialog, click the Choose Library button. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QYw44.png" alt="iTunes - choosing another library"/li liNavigate to the new iTunes folder you just copied and stronglocate the codeiTunes Library.itl/code file/strong/li liClick Choose (Mac OS X) or Open (Windows)/li liiTunes will open and your iTunes Library will be restored./li /ol  <comment59205> Which specific support document are you referring to? You have to select the folder from inside iTunes of course. <comment106556> Hey Lily, have a look at my answer below. When you open the itunes media folder, you then need to **select the `iTunes Library.itl` file**. This file will then restore your library <comment240383> Thank you very much, that just made my life a lot simpler!
