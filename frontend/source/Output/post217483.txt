Is it safe to put a screen protector on Macbook Pro Retina? <body> I read a few answers/articles. But that only made the confusion worse.  strongCommon answers were:/strong  emNo, don't put screen , because:/em  ol liThere is very little gap between Keyboard &amp; Display and adding a screen guard in middle would put pressure on display/li liAdhesive on screen guard could damage the coating on Retina display (anti-reflective coating?)/li /ol  emYes, put a screen guard:/em  ol start="3" liIt'll prevent dust scratches (dust on keyboard causing a scratch./li liIt'll prevent grease/acid on keyboard sticking to display thus preventing damage to reflective coating./li /ol  strongPlease share your opinions./strong  BTW, 3. already happened to me. I recently got a very tiny dust scratch on my display, which is the reason why I've been thinking of putting a screen guard.  <answer217484> Most answers for this question are going to mainly opinion-based, but most will agree that reason 1 isn't true at all, (do you see a rubber lining run around the bezel of your MacBook screen?), and 2 usually only happens if you buy a cheap screen protector (a good one should cost more than $20).  You should be just fine if you buy a high-quality screen protector from a good source.  <answer217485> It's generally safe, but your Mac will have bigger problems than grease on the screen if you put it in bags where it gets pressure that causes the screen to touch the keys. I would avoid those situations or use a thin cloth on the keys if you are worried about grease transfer, grit and surface wear on the glass.  Optically, you sacrifice a lot with any film - even the best 3M quality ones. Unless you need a privacy filter or just feel better with a screen protector, I would recommend taking other measures to counteract your various issues and leave the glass as Apple designed it. Also, keeping a film clean is much harder than keeping glass clean.  Also, if you have wearing of the glass, I have seen Apple cover that under AppleCare - they chose and designed the coatings and surfaces and make tradeoffs between gaps and durability. If you expect a function like retina screen to endure normal use - that retina screen resolution is not functioning properly if the glass has become worn.  I also have seen repairs declined to be covered under warranty (you can always pay for a cosmetic repair if you wish) when it's purely a cosmetic issue - not actually interfering with the proper function of the hardware:  ol liAnti glare should last reasonably well/li liIf there are no signs of damage or mis-alignment, gaps in the screen could either be covered or not covered./li /ol  Without knowing how you use the computer, it's hard to generalize what's the best tradeoff for your use case. Hopefully discussing your points helps you and others decide what to do.
