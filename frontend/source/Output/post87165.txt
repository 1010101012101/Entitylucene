git doesn't work anymore after moving user home to external drive <body> I've moved my users home directory from code/Users/romeovs/code to code/Volumes/DATA/home/code and ever since I get a git error.   Whenever I use codegit clone/code or codegit init/code it replies:  precode fatal: Failed to expand user dir in: '~git/init' /code/pre  has anyone had this problem? I tried reinstalling codegit/code from codehombrew/code but that didn't fix it (I am using the homebrew installed git from code/usr/local/Cellar/code)  <answer88657> The problem was indeed a faulty configuration directive:  precode[init]      templatedir=~git/init /code/pre  which I accidently copied from another machine, without copying the template directory as well.  <comment101817> Did you just move the directory? <comment101818> yes  I copied all the files and then went into 'System Preferences  Users and Groups  [username]  Advanced Options...' and changed the *Home Directory* to match this. Then I did `sudo rm -r /Users/username` to remove old userdir. <comment101819> What does `cd ~` result to in the shell? Also why did you move your entire home directory to an external volume? That probably is a bad idea to start with. <comment101823> `cd ~` works perfectly fine. as does the rest of my computer / shell. <comment101828> Maybe a wrong configuration directive? `git config -l` <comment101841> 1. Did you check all you permissions? Permissions of files and folders can change when you copy them. 2. Did you check that any config paths are hardwired to your old directory?
