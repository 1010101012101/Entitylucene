Terminal Tab Title after SSH Session <body> In Mac OS X (I'm on 10.6.8, though I believe other versions are the same) ssh'ing into a remote machine changes the title of the current tab in Terminal. Annoyingly, when I disconnect from the remote machine, either explicitly with codeexit/code or via a timeout, the title of the tab doesn't change back to what it was.  On an almost daily basis this nearly causes me to suffer a heart attack, when I'm typing away performing some command or other, only to see out of the corner of my eye that the tab is still named user@remotehost. I'm a cautious user that always tends to codepwd/code etc to confirm my location before doing anything, yet it still catches me in a moment of panic when I'm doing codeDROP DATABASE x/code and I see the remote host name in the tab.  Long story short, is there a way to revert this title when disconnecting from a remote host, or do I have to stick with opening a new tab every time I disconnect, to reset the title?  <answer88540> Add a codePROMPT_COMMAND/code to your  code.bash_profile/code  precodeexport PROMPT_COMMAND="echo -ne '\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}\007';$PROMPT_COMMAND" /code/pre  The codePROMPT_COMMAND/code gets executed every time the prompt is displayed.  Please note that we include the existing codePROMPT_COMMAND/code environment variable, such that we do not lose any existing settings (i.e. codeupdate_terminal_cwd/code).  <comment104271> Just the ticket, thanks. <comment179919> Be sure to *add* your code to PROMPT_COMMAND rather than replacing it, e.g., `PROMPT_COMMAND="your code; $PROMPT_COMMAND"`; otherwise, you’ll disable other functionality that uses this variable. For example, /etc/bashrc uses it to set the terminal’s current working directory so Terminal can display it and use it for various operations. <comment256717> @ChrisPage Does the new code need to come before `$PROMPT_COMMAND` for the other functionality to be preserved? <comment306069> Why not put it directly into PS1? <comment328237> is this how you edit the `.bash_profile`? `sublime $HOME/.bash_profile` ? <comment328238> terminal names also reset when you quit `npm` <comment329011> @Awesome_girl Make sure that the `subl` command is installed, and then edit the file from your terminal using `subl ~/.bash_profile`.
