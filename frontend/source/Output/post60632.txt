How do I use the Logitech Webcam 9000 on my Macbook Pro? <body> I have OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion installed on my Macbook Pro. I want to use my Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 webcam with it, but Logitech does not include drivers for OS X.  I need an camera that is not on the laptop.  Is there third-party software I can use to make this work on my MacBook?  <answer83372> I use the Logitech Pro 9000 webcam (which shows up as a Miscellaneous Device in System Profiler, see below) under Mac OS X 10.8.2.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bq3oC.png" alt="enter image description here"  No drivers are required. Simply plug the camera in, then launch a video-enabled application (such as Skype.) You should be able to select the camera as a video device within the app without further ado:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zozaP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment69796> The Logitech site you link to seems to imply that you *don't need* a driver. Have you tried the camera in your Mac? It seems like it should "just work". What actual problem are you encountering? Does the camera work on a Windows computer? <comment69871> @CajunLuke - I plugged the camera in, but Skype did not pick it up.  Maybe I need a reboot for that to work.  Yes, that camera has worked on several Windows environments for a few years now.
