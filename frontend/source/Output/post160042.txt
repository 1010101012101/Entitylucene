why cannot I edit my `hosts` file? <body> I'm trying to edit my hosts file, because doing codessh &lt;some host in hosts&gt;/code fails to translate to ip.  according to the Finder UI it is found under:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U09p7.png" alt="enter image description here" however when trying to run codecat hosts/code from the terminal I get an error:  precode➜  /etc  cat hosts cat: hosts: No such file or directory /code/pre  I tried to create a new hosts file but then I see another one is created next to the first one  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pu04B.png" alt="enter image description here"  but when I try to edit the second codehosts/code I need to duplicate to anther destination. I copy it to code/etc/code and again the first problem occurs.  I have tried to change the permissions to everyone can read and write. But yet it didn't help.  <answer160043> Just Change what you want to change on the duplicate, then replace the old codehosts/code file.  <answer160050> Usually only the root user is allowed to modify the file codehosts/code.  To do that and fix your hosts file or your /etc folder (depending where you applied your read/write permissions) follow these steps:  ol liThrow away your newly created codehosts/code file (but not the old one!)/li liRepair your permissions with codeDisk Utility/code. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ePUnD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liOpen Terminal and enter codesudo nano /etc/hosts/code and hit kbd↵/kbd/li liEnter your password (it will not be shown!) and hit kbd↵/kbdbr The standard hosts file in Yosemite looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2FIXu.jpg" alt="nano"/li liEdit your codehosts/code file.br The format for each line is IP-address, then a tab or a single space and the hostname(s). Terminate the file with an empty trailing line./li liwrite the changes to disk with kbdctrl/kbdkbdO/kbd followed by kbd↵/kbd and exit nano with kbdctrl/kbdkbdx/kbd/li liEnter codeexit/code, hit kbd↵/kbd and quit codeTerminal.app/code/li /ol  As an alternative for the steps 3-7 you may download and install hosts.prefpane and enter your additional hosts there.  <answer160051> The best way I have found to change hosts settings is to:  1) Make a duplicate (which you already have done)  2) Move the duplicate to a new location, such as the desktop  3) Make another duplicate on the desktop and rename it "hosts ORIGINAL" so you know it is the original hosts file, in case you need to revert back.  4) Make the changes to "hosts" on the desktop and save it.  5) Delete or rename the "hosts" file in /etc to "hosts OLD"  6) Drag "hosts" from the desktop to /etc. (you may be asked for admin credentials)  <answer160052> There shouldn't be a way to have two identically named files in the /etc folder. Can you do a Get Info on the original and verify the Name &amp; Extension (and that the extension is not hidden, and that there are no spaces at the end of the name)?  <answer192815> I encountered this problem in Yosemite 10.10.3. I couldn't find the solution until I started to think outside the box.  Most people don’t know it, but as default the ”/private/etc” folder and ”/private/etc/hosts” file permissions are set to ”read only”. So if you only change the ”hosts” file permissions to ”read and write” you still won’t be able to edit it in TextEdit. The ”hosts” file is locked due to the ”/private/etc” folder.  The trick is that you need to change both the permissions of ”/private/etc” folder then ”/private/etc/hosts” file.  sudo chmod 777 /private/etc;chmod 777 /private/etc/hosts;open -t /private/etc/hosts  I don't care if it is a bug or not!  <comment188328> one was `hosts.txt` <comment188464> That can happen if you create the file from scratch in TextEdit (or a similar app) and simply save it in the /etc/ folder and aren't extremely vigilant about the extension as well as the "hide extension" option. <comment229563> You don't need write permissions to the containing folder to change a file's contents. That's not how the unix permission system works. <comment229594> @JensErat you don't need write permissions to edit a file in place. But some gui editors write to a temp file in the same folder, and if that works they delete the old file and rename new to old. THAT process requires write-to-parent folder.
