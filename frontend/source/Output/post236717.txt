Automator: "Run Shell Script" throws error because of missing "on" command <body> OSX 10.11.4 here.  I'm trying to create a workflow for use with a hotkey, to run a simple shell script.   Created via: Automator - New Service - Utilities - Run Shell Script, then set to 'no input' in 'Finder', and shell set to "/bin/bash".  For a trivial script, say, one containing nothing but "ls", it works.  But I'm only getting errors so far for the script I actually want to run, which includes a call of "on run", which seems to cause problems. After debugging a bit, I can bring it down to this:  precodeon run {input, parameters}  end run /code/pre  results in error:  precodeRun Shell script failed - 1 error -: line 2: on: command not found /code/pre  Might have something to do with a missing path I figured, so I already tried working on that, e.g. by adding:  precodePATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin export PATH /code/pre  or:  precodePATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin export PATH /code/pre  as suggested here. Didn't help.  Note as well: I have Anaconda installed, which looks like it changed the path in .bash_profile. Then again, I'm not even sure if the bash environment invoked by automator looks at .bash_profile.  Any ideas what to try next?  <answer236721> codeon run {input, parameters}/code is AppleScript syntax, not a valid shell command. If you want to execute AppleScript in the service, use the Run AppleScript action instead of Run Shell Script.  <comment289769> Um... that's worth a "D'oh!". Thanks! Marked as answered.
