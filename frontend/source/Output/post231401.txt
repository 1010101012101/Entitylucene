Why don't changes in the bashrc file work on a new terminal window? <body> I'm trying to add an alias to the bashrc file. Since I'm not good at this, Im' going to write all the steps I took  precodenano ~/.bashrc /code/pre  The file had this in it  precodeexport PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting /code/pre  On top of that I added my alias  precodedropUpload(){ ~/drop.sh upload $1 $2 } alias dropU=dropUpload /code/pre  Saved the file and then sourced it with code. ~/.bashrc/code  In the same window I tried using the code codedropU first/url second/url/code and it worked. I closed the terminal window and opened a new one, the code no longer works. The error I get is     -bash: dropU: command not found   If I codenano/code back to the file my new code is there. If I re-source the file, the code works. How can I get this to persist?   <answer231402> in my code~/.bash_profile/code have this code  precodeif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then     . ~/.bashrc fi /code/pre  @Mark have a greate answer here.  I found a link that clear that case at Unix FAQ for OSX.  It wrote      strongBash Startup Files/strong      When a "login shell" starts up, it reads the file "/etc/profile" and then "~/.bash_profile" or "~/.bash_login" or "~/.profile" (whichever one exists - it only reads one of these, checking for them in the order mentioned).      When a "non-login shell" starts up, it reads the file "/etc/bashrc" and then the file "~/.bashrc".      Note that when bash is invoked with the name "sh", it tries to mimic the startup sequence of the Bourne shell ("sh"). In particular, a non-login shell invoked as "sh" does not read any dot files by default. See the bash man page for details.   <comment282608> could someone tell me why my answer got a downvote? <comment282610> That didn't work for me. (I didn't downvote) <comment282611> First, we confirm that your `.bashrc` sourced automatically on your new terminal session. You can try to add to `.bashrc` a simple alias like `alias myEcho='echo Anubeloredelana'`, which print `Anubeloredelana` onto the terminal, and in a new terminal session try to call it to see if it work. <comment282612> The answer given by @Mark [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119711/why-mac-os-x-dont-source-bashrc/119714#119714) is 100% correct -- Terminal sources `~/.bash_profile`, not `~/.bashrc`. Double check that you added the correct lines to your `~/.bash_profile`? <comment282615> FIXED! after you told me to add `if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc fi` I realised I was adding it in both `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile`. Now it works. I can't upvote (not enough reputation) but thanks for your help @binhsonnguyen <comment282623> they are not only commands, they are the way that the os work for you. cheers.
