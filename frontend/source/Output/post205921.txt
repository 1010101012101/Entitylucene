Macbook Pro Wifi Speeds 92% slower than PC <body> Macbook Pro (Retina 15-inch, 2013) running Yosemite 10.10.4, with strongbluetooth turned off/strong. Still seeing terrible speeds over wifi. Any advice would be appreciated.  These tests were run at the exact same time with an old Dell laptop running Windows 7 (2009) sitting next to the macbook:  strongMacbook:/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmTPT.png" alt="Macbook 2013"  strongPC: (7.68mbps down, 2.54mbps up)/strong  I repeated the tests several times and always found the macbook to be at least 50% slower.  strongUPDATE:/strong It appears the difference is caused by the MacBook connecting to the router at 802.11strongb/strong whereas the PC (and other devices) connect at 802.11strongg/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJID2.png" alt="PC and MacBook wifi speed comparison"  The router does not let me limit to 'g' alone, only 'b/g'. When I am closer in range to the router the Macbook connects on 'g' and has the same speed as the PC.  <comment248267> Both tests to the chicago location. <comment248335> "Exact same time" I assume you mean one after another, and not concurrent.    Is the router single band or dual band?  And is the router close by the testing location? Does turning the MacBook 45, 90 or 180 degrees have an effect? <comment248462> Both, actually, This specific test was concurrent (starting the mac first, then the PC a few seconds later). But results were always the same regardless of position in the room or timing (concurrent or staggered). <comment248753> As it's the broadband speed that the test is giving you details for, can you replicate it over the Mac's ethernet connection to see if you get similar results? That would let you rule out whether it's specific to your wifi connection.
