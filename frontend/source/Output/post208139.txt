How to deal with unzip error on a large file in OSX? <body> I downloaded the latest Raspbian image from the raspberrypi.org website on my Mac running OS X 10.10.5 The SHA-1 checksum agrees with that listed on the website.  When I try to extract using codeunzip/code I get the following error  precodewarning [2015-09-24-raspbian-jessie.zip]:  76 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile   (attempting to process anyway) error [2015-09-24-raspbian-jessie.zip]:  reported length of central directory is   -76 bytes too long (Atari STZip zipfile?  J.H.Holm ZIPSPLIT 1.1   zipfile?).  Compensating...    skipping: 2015-09-24-raspbian-jessie.img  need PK compat. v4.5 (can do v2.1)  note:  didn't find end-of-central-dir signature at end of central dir.   (please check that you have transferred or created the zipfile in the   appropriate BINARY mode and that you have compiled UnZip properly) /code/pre  <answer208194> This is apparently a known "bug" in OS X Archiver, which is unable to handle zip greater than 4Â GB.  <answer208424> You can use 7za from p7zip installed from brew:  precodebrew install p7zip /code/pre  and then unzip using the command  precode 7za x big_file.zip /code/pre  <answer208429> I managed to unzip it with tar.    precodetar xzvf 2015-09-24-raspbian-jessie.zip /code/pre  Requires no installation of additional software  <answer209690> The ZIP file can also be uncompressed using codeditto/code, no software installation needed:  precodeditto -x -k 2015-09-24-raspbian-jessie.zip . /code/pre  Worked for me.  <comment252548> Magic! The 'z' is not needed  `tar -xvf 2015-09-24-raspbian-jessie.zip` <comment262147> yeah archiver seems to create .cpgz file out of it (i.e. "corrupted zip rezipped" file or some odd).  And the "unzip" command line also doesn't work on it, but the other answers here seemed to work fine. Weird. (apparently some larger files are "zip64" format?) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32439742/modern-ie-windows-10-virtualbox-for-mac-zip-file-corrupt
