Work offline in Google Drive on iPad <body> Is there a way to work offline on a Google Drive document on an iPad?  I'm aware it's possible on a desktop or laptop when using Chrome, but I can't seem to see an option for such a functionality in the Google Drive app.  You can make a file available offline, but you can only view it if you do that.  I can't seem to be able to edit it though.   I was reading an article on the Google Docs blog, but it doesn't seem clear to me whether offline editing is one thing and the app is another, or if offline editing is a feature of the app.  <answer76587> There is a link in the article you mentioned where it says the following:      "The Google Drive app for iPhone and iPad lets you view items you've stored in Google Drive with your device even when it isn't connected to the Internet or a mobile network. strongOffline editing isnâ€™t currently supported./strong"   supEmphasis added/sup  http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=107975  <answer216600> Google Docs for iPad now supports off line editing: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-docs/id842842640?mt=8  Under the listed features:     Get stuff done anytime -- even without an internet connection   I have just tested it out on my iPad mini, and it worked fine off line, syncing and updating the shared document once I connected again.  <comment88819> @sam, I'm assuming they will add this in a future update. It is correct that at least as of version 1.1.2699 offline editing doesn't work. Hopefully you can tether or something. <comment88820> cheers, cant see how i missed that <comment88842> The really frustrating thing is that an earlier version of the app did support offline editing. Google just disabled it in an update.
