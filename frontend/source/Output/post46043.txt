Getting weird symlink errors when using Java <body> So I am trying to install an IBM application on a Mac using the unix/linux binaries. However, when I run the setup utility I get the following error....  precode(Mar 26, 2012 12:18:23 PM), Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.ISMPLogFileAction, msg1, Primary Install Package Path: /Users/jgleaso/DownloadDirector/C1G00ML/UpdateInstaller/updi.primary.pak(Mar 26, 2012 12:19:50 PM), Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.ISMPCopy FilesAction, err, /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Home/bundle/Commands/javaws (Too many levels of symbolic links) /code/pre  Of course this looks like a bug thanks to the ../ symlink (couldn't they have made it to the absolute path?). Anyone have an insight on how to get around this?   <comment52530> Which IBM application are you trying to install? <comment52532> IBM Update Installer for Websphere and yes I know that isn't supported but that is why this isn't a PMR :-)
