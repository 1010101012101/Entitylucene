Can't increase Mac OSX bash shell history length <body> I set ~/.bash_profile some time ago to have more than 500 lines length but seems system can't catch this.   Do you know why?  precode&gt; nano -w ~/.bash_profile export CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=GxFxCxDxBxegedabagaced HISTFILESIZE=10000000  &gt; history | wc -l      500 /code/pre  <answer246623> You also need to set codeHISTSIZE=10000000/code.  codeHISTFILESIZE/code determines the number of lines to keep in the history file while codeHISTSIZE/code determines the number of lines to keep in memory.  Both default to code500/code  Execute codeecho $HISTFILESIZE $HISTSIZE/code before you make the change and then again after.  You should see code10000000 500/code first then code10000000 10000000/code after.
