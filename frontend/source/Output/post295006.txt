Cellular data isn't showing any of the apps I have installed except FaceTime and wallet <body> I have an iPhone 6 with iOS 10.3.3. After updating, I've found a problem with the cellular data settings. None of the apps are appearing besides Wallet (which I previously removed) and FaceTime. I've been trying to get the apps to appear but none are showing up. I've tried reading similar posts, and using the answer, but have had no success.  However some of my apps like snapchat are automatically using my data whereas safari isn't. Below is a screenshot of what my cellular data looks like.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJl6L.png" alt="No apps show up, and no data is used. The phone has cellular data turned off for fFaceTime, and wallet. Wi-Fi Assist is also disabled."
