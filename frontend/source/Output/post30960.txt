WiFi Failing and Keychain crashing <body> I have a Macbook Pro 13 from about a year ago running OSX Lion.br Whenever I connect to my school's WiFi, I can't seem to get to the WiFi Login page I was told the problem was probably in Keychain Access, but it crashes as soon as I try to open it whenever this is happening.br Using Safari or Chrome, I can't seem to get to any websites, it just hangs or gives me a page load error.br Firefox works though without any issues.  <answer32446> A friend of mine had a similar problem. After trying the usual fixes (restarting, removing wi-fi networks, removing wi-fi network interface, resetting PRAM and SMC, deleting login keychain from ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain), I was able to solve the Keychain Access crashing (and wi-fi issues) using a solution from here: http://www.unsanity.org/archives/security/love_tropicana.php  In short, remove the wi-fi network (from System Preferences  Network  Advanced  Preferred Networks), then open Terminal and type in these two lines:  precode$ sudo mv /var/db/CodeEquivalenceDatabase $ /var/db/CodeEquivalenceDatabase.old /code/pre  (For more information, read the page I linked to above.)  Then restart, and see if Keychain Access opens - it did for me. You can then delete any passwords or certificates related to your school's wi-fi. Then try connecting to the network again.  <answer262404> You have to make sure your keychain is unlocked before removing entries.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/In2r8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment60618> That terminal command should be one long line, not two.
