Pixelmator automator convert to Photoshop not working <body> I'm trying to build an automator script that will convert all Pixelmator files to Photoshop, but it's not working. This is the script:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Elkrf.png" alt="enter image description here"  and when I run it I see these results:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZqQv.png" alt="enter image description here"  but the PSD is not present. You can even see the icon looks empty in Automator. The pxm file is at the Desktop destination.  Any ideas what's wrong? What am I missing?  <comment364320> Doesn't seem to me like there is anything wrong with it. What if you try to use the default Change type of images to see if it's the Automator action that is screwing it up. <comment364581> @Joonas: changing to other types works and the converted image appears. <comment364594> Seems like the next step would be to contact pixelmator devs. Might be something wrong with their Automator action.
