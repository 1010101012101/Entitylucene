Clipboard manager for Mac that doesn't use any cloud service <body> I'm looking for a clipboard manager app/tool for Mac (Mavericks) that does not use any cloud service for saving/syncing data.  I mean that it doesn't save my content on any cloud server, but on my machine locally only.  Is there any?  <answer113253> I use flycut, an open source fork of jumpcut, available in the app store.  <answer113254> I use Copyclip. It remembers a certain amount of clips. You can also blacklist apps from which it should not clip something, for instance password managers. It does not use any kind of cloud. It is only local.  To verify that it does not use any cloud services. You can block the app from accessing the internet. OS X Firewall or third party app. Or you can check all established internet connections with:  precodelsof -i | grep -E "(LISTEN|ESTABLISHED)" /code/pre  Or trust the developers that they have not put any hidden cloud abilities into the app. Or use some OpenSource app and check the code. Or develop yourself.  <comment132897> you mean it should use iCloud ? <comment132901> it doesn't use 3rd party cloud service? <comment132905> it doesn't use 3rd party cloud service? <comment132906> answer edited: no cloud service at all <comment132908> No, everything stored locally. <comment133092> thanks. how can I make sure? <comment133094> thanks, how can I make sure? <comment133095> I mean that it doesn't save my content on any cloud server, but on my machine locally only <comment133100> answer edited: 2 ways <comment133101> 2 more ways. check answer <comment133102> @Elad Benda - There's an option in the General settings for "Dropbox sync" which is OFF by default. Change the "Clippings" setting to "After each clip" and copy something. You will see the file `~/Library/Application Support/Flycut/com.generalarcade.flycut.plist` has been updated and contains your clipboard contents.
