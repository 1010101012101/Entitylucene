MacBook Air Mid 2013 Wi-Fi MAC Address <body> If I change my network interface card on my MacBook Air 2013, which I assume to be my AirPort/Bluetooth card, will it change my laptop's MAC Address?   <answer243873> Yes, that is correct; it will change.  Your MAC (Media Access Control) address is assigned to network interfaces, not to the computer.  For example, on this WiFi adapter from a Macbook Pro, you can see the MAC address imprinted on the chip (circled in red)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fHkvL.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can even lookup the manufacturer of the WiFi adapter by entering the first six characters into a lookup tool like this one.  In this case, "58b035" comes back as "Apple, Inc"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ezkAi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment300416> Keep in mind that if you need to access something using a certain MAC address that it can be [temporally changed](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151986/change-mac-address-in-os-x-yosemite).
