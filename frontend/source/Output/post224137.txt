Is phone call history available on OS X? <body> For example, we know messages are saved in code~/Library/Messages/chat.db/code however where are calls saved? Is there a folder or file?  <answer224202> You can view a list of recent calls in the Phone app, just tap "Recents" at the bottom.   I would imagine that this list is saved in an iTunes backup of your device. There are a number of apps for Mac and Windows that allow you to explore the backup file and extract quite a number of the files. I do not know if the list of recent calls is saved.  On occasion I have used iExplore for viewing the contents of the backup. There are others out there that do similar things.  <answer227001> I found my history at:  ~/Library/Application Support/CallHistoryDB/CallHistory.storedata  <comment271793> What app are you using under OS X to make calls with? <comment271794> @user3439894 FaceTime takes the calls I think? <comment271924> I want to be able to save them programatically. This won't work. <comment275692> What is a `storedata` file? How do I read it? <comment275693> It seems to be a sqlite database.  I read it with an app called [sqlitebrowser](http://sqlitebrowser.org). <comment277466> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23117831/what-is-the-difference-between-sqlite-and-storedata
