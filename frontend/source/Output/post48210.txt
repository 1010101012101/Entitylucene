What options exist for ad free web browsing on iOS? <body> In OS X I can use extensions in most browsers to block ads. This offers an distraction free browsing experience.  For example: In Safari, Chrome and Firefox I can use strongAdblock/strong or strongAdblock Plus/strong. Both extensions use filter lists which you can find here. You can also manually add filters and add sites on which you accept to see ads (e.g. apple.stackexchange.com).

For instance it is possible to modifie the hostfile or DNS-Entrys on your router. This will only work with wifi. i dont know if it is possible to modify your DNS server for 3G connection. i think it was possible via APN settings iin ios4/5. But with iOS6 i was not able to find any solution.  <answer86200> Use Privoxy as an ad-stripping proxy server on a Linux box such as the inexpensive Raspberry Pi featured in this article: http://kimondo.co.uk/raspberry-pi-as-an-adblock-server-for-ipad-iphone-android-and-anything-else-on-your-network/  I have tried this and it works well.

I use many apps that use web browsers embedded and not using mobile Safari and those apps to browse the web is a non-starter for me. I do appreciate the iOS apps that look to be a fuller featured Safari - but am willing to set up more of an infrastructure for the reasons stated here. <comment83582> @bmike I was getting at the fact this product currently doesn't exist, it's scheduled for release in Feb '13 and that's only if they pass their goal. <comment83607> @Dunhamzzz I totally get that - but we also are a place for even wrong answers - as long as the answerer is moving the discussion forward. What may be down voted / unuseful to some since it doesn't ship - might still be the best answer for others. Your comment is proper, correct and in the right place - just wanted to reinforce that despite some downvoting it - it's also worth supporting for others. <comment98761> The problem with Weblock is that works only on WiFi and you need to configure for each and every WiFi network. <comment99615> How do you set this as a proxy to all the Wifi and 3G connections you make? <comment121551> bleo, please disclose your affiliation with the product in the answer, so that others are aware of your connection with the app you are recommending.  (Just listing it in your profile is not enough, as many people are unlikely to check your profile.) <comment121557> Welcome to Ask Different! @D.W. is correct - a good place to disclose a relationship with your product is in the profile.

I guess iPad1's Safari has a lot less to deal with the ads removed and so doesn't run out of resources so often.
