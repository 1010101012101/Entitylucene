Parental Controls on OS X reset themselves upon reboot <body> I set up Parental Controls on my daughter's Mac Book Pro.  Sorry I don't know the OS, but the Mac is about 2 years old.  Anyway we spent a few hours going through enabling all the web sites she needs.  Yes, I chose "Alway Allow".  So after spending a couple of hours doing this, I had her completely shut down the Mac, restart and assure all of the sites I had allowed still worked, and yes they did.  Now this morning I get a IM from her that she can't access any of the web sites she needs for school.  So I high tail it to  her school and have to go through the whole process of allowing specific web sites again.    What good is this if I have to do this every time the computer is started?
