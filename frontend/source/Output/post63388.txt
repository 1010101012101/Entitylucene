What is the best way to export iphoto library to a certain folder structure? <body> I have done a lot of processing to my iphoto library (organizing events, etc) and I want to export my iphoto library to a external hard drive but I want others to see the files so i don't want to just store the iphoto library package.  Is there any ability to export in certain patterns like  precodePhotos / [Year] / [EventName] / /code/pre  or something similar to this?  <answer63390> Yes. Couple of possibilities  ol liIf you have the latest version of iPhoto 11 there's a limited option in the Export dialogue. (File - Export. Note the 'Subfolder Format' option in the Export dialogue. Remember you actually have to have an Event selected for the option to appear)/li liFor earlier versions, or more granularity, Apps like iPhoto2Disk or PhoShare will help you export to a Folder tree matching your Events./li /ol  <answer90817> I've actually had this very same issue, and I didn't want to pay for any solutions - so I created a quick free Applescript that does the work for you.  Open the App, point it to your iPhoto Library, tell it where to save the photos, and go get a cup of coffee. Your photos will be copied *(not moved) to the destination folder, completely sorted with Folder names by Event.  I've posted this on my Mac Help Website: http://soniq.org/soniq/15749/iphoto-export-all-events-to-folders  I know it's an older thread, but this really did help me sort my 2000 events into nice clean folders.   <comment109344> I tried your script but it only exported some events not all of them, giving me an error. I should probably show you the error right? I will get a screenshot tonight. <comment109441> that would be helpful :)
