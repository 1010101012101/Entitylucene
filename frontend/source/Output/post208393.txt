Change delay for auto-hide on menu bar <body> In 10.11 is there a way to change the delay for showing the menu bar when auto-hide is enabled? I know for the dock you could use terminal and codedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0/code  <answer252515> I ran the following Terminal command codedefaults find Menu Bar/code and found this:  codeFound 1 keys in domain 'Apple Global Domain': {     "_HIHideMenuBar" = 0; }/code  The code_HIHideMenuBar/codeproperty can be either 0 for emDisabled/em or 1 for emEnabled/em. And that's the same setting found in emSystem Preferences - General - Automatically hide and show the menu bar/em.  So I guess it isn't possible as of today.  <answer260396> Open a terminal and enter the following:  precodedefaults write "Apple Global Domain" com.apple.springing.delay -int 0 /code/pre  Then logout and log back in.  <comment278330> Looks like it's hardly possible:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/204415/making-the-auto-hidden-menu-bar-show-up-faster
