Difference between "diskutil unmount" and "diskutil unmountDisk"? <body> Sometimes when I try to unmount a disk using the "diskutil" command I get the following message:  precode$ diskutil unmount /dev/disk1 disk1 was already unmounted or it has a partitioning scheme so use "diskutil unmountDisk" instead /code/pre  when I replace "unmount" with "unmountDisk" it works perfectly fine.  So my question is, strongwhat's the difference between the "unmount" and "ummountDisk" commands?/strong  <answer235162> From codeman diskutil/code:  precode unmount | umount [force] device      Unmount a single volume.  Force will force-unmount the volume (less kind to any open      files; see also umount (8)).   unmountDisk | umountDisk [force] device      Unmount an entire disk (all volumes).  Force will force-unmount the volumes (less kind      to any open files; see also umount (8)).  You should specify a whole disk, but all      volumes of the whole disk are attempted to be unmounted even if you specify a parti-      tion. /code/pre  So codediskutil unmount/code just ejects a single volume/partition, codediskutil unmountDisk/code the whole disk (including all volumes/partitions).  <answer235165> You are using the command incorrectly. When issuing codediskutil unmount/code, you should refer to a partition. You are referring to an entire disk. For example codedisk0/code refers to the entire disk, where as, codedisk0s1/code refers to partition 1 on disk 0. The letter codes/code stands for slice which is another word for partition.  On the other hand, it is Ok to refer to either the entire disk or just a partition when trying to unmount an entire disk. So  precodediskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0s1 /code/pre  would be equivalent to   precodediskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  Both unmount the entire codedisk0/code.  <comment287622> Makes sense, the disk I was attempting to eject contained multiple volumes. Thanks!
