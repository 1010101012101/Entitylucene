Deleted Safari and now I cannot get it back. Mavericks <body> I deleted my Safari browser and now I would like to download it again but it seems that this option is not as easy to be done. I'm running OS X Mavericks at the moment, and there is no download for Safari on the Apple page except for those before OS X Lion.  <answer124470> Safari gets reinstalled:  ul liSometimes when you download and install a Combo Updater./li liAlways when you reinstall the OS./li /ul  You could also use a tool like Pacifist to get the app from the install package (or Time Machine from your backup), but it depends on how you lost the app whether you want to go in like a surgeon or have the deluxe treatment. Unless you are sure you can use Pacifist, I'd start with the Combo and then move to the normal installer.  <answer124519> You can copy Safari from the recovery partition:  precodediskutil mount Recovery\ HD hdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg cp -R /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/Applications/Safari.app /Applications /code/pre  Alternatively redownload an OS X installer from App Store and then use Pacifist:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fqt62.png" alt=""  <answer147813> Download and install Safari 7.1 manually, directly from Apple. This is the same link the App Store uses to check for updates. (Note that if you install that package on anything other than Mavericks — assuming Installer would even permit such a thing to happen — you will probably cause more harm than good. That package is for Mavericks only, as the filename says.)

Your safest bet is to re-download the Mavericks Installer from App Store, but perhaps if you edit some details in the question we can guide you better than the linked question with several options. <comment145616> …especially since [Safari on the Recovery HD is probably old](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115173/whats-different-about-safari-app-in-os-x-and-safari-app-on-the-recovery-hd) so the 'grab the file from the Recovery HD' trick probably isn't ideal. — cc @bmike <comment145662> So far on 10.9, the Recovery HD is unpatched and most people are at 10.9.2 with [several Safari security updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6145). Although I'd prefer the Pacifist route myself, nothing here is untrue. Also, I haven't done the work to determine if the fixes on "10.9.2 Safari" are really framework fixes that could reside outside /Applications entirely.
