How to use "diskutil corestorage revert lvuuid" on Yosemite if disk says it is not reversible? <body> I would like to make a partition for Linux.

Previously, I tried to run the command (on Revertible: yes (decryption required), with FileVault key), but I couldn't tell if it worked. Afterwards, I turned off FileVault, and it stopped being revertible.   <answer166588> looking at your diskutil list output, your disk0s2 partition type is not correct; it should be Apple_CoreStorage, but has remained Apple_HFS (probably due to the interruption of the conversion process). If you are able to access the data on your internal disk, strongI would recommend backing up your data first./strong  erasing your internal disk and doing a clean reinstallation of OS X, running Software Update to bring it up-to-date, and then restoring from your backup maybe the simple way.  if you want to do, you can find a way to fix that. Unfortunately I can not reproduce the problem, so I can not give exact instructions.  BTW: after making a backup, you can try disk utility app to repair disk, maybe it will solve this issue.   <comment195401> Thanks for the response! Just wondering, if "conversion progress" says completed, is it possible that the conversion was already done? How would I check?
