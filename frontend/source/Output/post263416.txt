Is it possible to watch a purchased movie on iPad without downloading it? <body> I bought a movie from iTunes store by using my iPad Mini 4. After the successful purchase procedure the "play icon" became visible, but when I click on it (still inside iTunes store) the movie does not start. When I click on the play button it opens Videos which says "There is no content, you can download it from iTunes Store". So it's a circle and it looks I cannot watch a purchased movie on my iPad without downloading it to my device. Is it a correct behavior? Do I really have to download a 3.7GB movie to my 16GB device to watch it in 2016? :(  Thank you for your help. Regards, JÃ³zsef
