"Automatically adjust brightness" nowhere to be seen <body> I have a situation where I'm using an app that calibrates my monitors.  I have several monitors attached and when I go into codeSystem Preferences/code - codeDisplays/code, I unfortunately don't see any options on any of my monitors to toggle an codeAutomatically adjust brightness/code setting as per the instructions:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GxaQR.png" alt="SuperCal"  My displays consist of:  ul li1x 30" Apple Cinema HD Display (Display Pane,br Options Pane)  /li li1x Dell U2711 (Display Panel)  /li li1x Acer G257HU (Display Panel)  /li li2x Sceptre E248W-1920R (Display Panel)/li /ul  I'm running MacOS 10.12.5.  emAny ideas on how to disable such a setting that is no where to be seen?/em  <comment366652> Operating system version? <comment366653> @Catija macOS 10.12.5. <comment366657> Have you tried to lock settings for Cinema Display and run again SuperCal? <comment366658> Something along those lines crossed my mind, but I don't see a way to "lock" the settings for the Cinema Display.  I did "Disable brightness buttons", but are there other options I'm missing @AndreyKuznetsov? <comment366660> https://cl.ly/2B3v2m0W1K10 Lock symbol :-) <comment366661> @AndreyKuznetsov no, that is just a settings lock for making changes. That's been toggled multiple times and does not affect anything: https://cl.ly/1Z0i1b2K1J3S
