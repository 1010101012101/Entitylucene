Where did music scan go on my iOS 4.2 iPod Touch 2nd Gen? <body> A week ago, I had a slider when playing music that let me scan through music really quickly. Now it's gone. Here's a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/At7DF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Did I change a setting or something? I can't find anything about it. The slider used to be near the top. I only have the standard fast-forward/rewind buttons now.  <answer173430> Have you tried tapping the album art while the music or podcast is playing? That should bring the "scrub-bar" to the screen where you can quickly scan through the media currently playing (seek-bar at the top of the picture).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9sG1U.jpg" alt="scrub-bar"  <comment204282> Boom! Thanks. :)
