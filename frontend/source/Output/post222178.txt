iTunes doesn't open, no error messages or anything, not even when executed through terminal <body> I just updated to iTunes 12, and I when I open it, nothing happens. The icon on the Dock doesn't even bounce. When I start it in the Terminal, nothing happens either, no messages. When I open it with codesudo/code, the application does show up in the dock with a dot, but no messages or UI.  I don't think it has anything to do with my user profile since it does not work in codesudo/code either, it does come closer to work though, but it's a very very small difference. I have rebooted the computer, obviously.  I also tried reinstalling it, it's been stuck on "moving files to their right places" with 1 minute left for em7/em hours.  <answer222965> Try opening in Safe Mode.  Command + Option keys when launching iTunes  <comment269166> Did you start the app bundle or the executable in there? If the app, then execute the executable in `appname.app/Contents/MacOs` <comment269167> @TheBro21 the executable. <comment269169> Could there be a log in the **Console.app** with iTunes, the last time it did work? It should be under *Diagnostic and Usage Info**, in User Diag reports. Also look in **Files  /Library/logs  Crash Reporter** and **Diag reports** <comment270227> "1 minute left" is the sign for "I'm doing your user stuff right now, I have no clue when it will finish, 'cos that depends on how much stuff you've got" … but if you've force-quit it, you broke it & will have to start over. I'd clear the saved state for starters & see how that goes … `~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.iTunes.savedState`
