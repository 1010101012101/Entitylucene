Adjusting brightness on 27" iMac used as external DisplayPort monitor for PC <body> I have a Windows7 64-bit machine attached to a 27" iMac as an external displayport monitor It's working well, except I cannot adjust the brightness.  I have attached a Mac keyboard both on the Mac &amp; Windows side to gain access to the brightness controls, with no luck. As soon as I switch to display target mode, the screen jumps to full brightness, and cannot be controlled from the keyboard on either platform.  I have searched the web but have not found the answer:br http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924br http://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/using-target-display-mode.htmbr https://superuser.com/questions/60145/how-do-i-use-a-new-27-imac-as-an-external-pc-monitor-with-full-2560x1440-resolu  <answer43778> One poster in this Apple discussion forum had a suggestion:     I've futzed with this for a while using a MBP and an iMac, both   running 10.6.8. The problem is inconsistent for me, but seems to be   linked to how long I've had the iMac on.  If on chronically (as I   usually leave it), the iMac tends not to respond to F1/F2 brightness   keystrokes when I connect my MBP and use the iMac in target display   mode. strongBut if I reboot the iMac and then connect from my already   running MBP, this restores brightness keystroke response./strong That is:      ol   liWith MBP and iMac running, connect mini DP to start target display mode on iMac/li   liIf brightness keystrokes don't respond, disconnect mini DP and reboot iMac, leave MBP running/li   liAfter booted to desktop on the iMac, reconnect mini DP - brightness keys should respond/li   /ol   I don't have your setup, so I can't verify that this solution works. However, it's worth a shot.  <answer61262> It is probably easier to adjust the brightness in windows from the display drivers settings. usually you can right click empty desktop and the display drivers UI is the first entry in context menu (like "AMD Vision Control Center"). All three major video card vendors can adjust brightness on the drivers side.  <answer80215> It is confirmed that should be able to control that with iMac's keyboard. I've tried but it doesn't work in your setup.  Also, the brightness doesn't show up under OS X's System Preferences, and I have no chance to test it under Windows since my Thunderbolt Macs will only connect under OS X, not under Windows 8 Boot Camp.  I will try DDC/CI software though it have a high chance of not working.  Your last option, though bad, is to adjust it with software like how you adjust it in game.  <comment49754> possible duplicate of [Can I change the brightness on a secondary display?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20237/can-i-change-the-brightness-on-a-secondary-display) <comment49902> I did everything you said replacing my Windows machine for the MBP in your setup. No dice :( <comment214344> Using an AppleKeyboard won't help since you don't have the drivers for it's function keys. Maybe installing bootcamp drivers on your machine will help. <comment366822> Yes, that works when I connect my iMac in TDM with my MacBook Air. However, I do not need to reboot the iMac. Simply reconnecting the cable works well for me. Another trick that works "many times" is to press Command+F1 (while the lid of the MacBook is open) and enable extended desktop mode. Once in that mode, the iMac starts responding to the brightness keys after certain attempts, and continues to do so after coming out of extended desktop mode (by pressing Command+F1 again).
