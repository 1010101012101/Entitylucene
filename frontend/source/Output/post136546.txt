OS X / Finder - Right Click “New Folder with Selection” - how to Increase the Animation Effect Speed? <body> 10.9.x Finder  The effect that pulls all the selected items into a new folder from the right click strong"New Folder with Selection"/strong is really nice, but way too slow for me.  Anyone know a terminal command that would increase the animation rate?
