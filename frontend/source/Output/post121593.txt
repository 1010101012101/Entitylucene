Tracing the forward use of values in formulas in Numbers <body> I use Numbers version 3.1 on Mavericks.  One can easily look at a formula in a given cell and immediately see the other cell references it uses.  I think of this as a backwards look.  Does any means or mechanism exist to do this forward rather than backwards?  By this I mean, can I trace the uses of a value or calculation in a cell as the propagate forward (typically down or to the right) through a spreadsheet - what formulas will use it rather than have used it.  I have used other spreadsheets, which had such a feature,  I just can't find it in Numbers.  If anyone knows how to do this please advise.  <answer121594> I presume you are referring to the formula relationship tool available in Excel:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/muD2l.gif"  I don't believe this feature is available in Numbers. You can notify Apple that you would like this feature implemented using their Numbers feedback page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/numbers.html/li /ul
