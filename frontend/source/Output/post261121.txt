Fix GPT after Bootcamp stalled <body> When trying to setup a Windows partition on my SSD, bootcamp stalled. OS X itself is still running fine, but I'm missing the space originally allocated to the windows partition, and cannot claim it back.   Diskutil reports I need a full scan or restore in recovery mode to fix the errors. But even in Recovery Mode (cmd+R upon restart), it says the same.  This is what codediskutil list/code says:  precodeMacBookAir2011:~ tliebig$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage OS X                    250.1 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            OS X                   +213.8 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  33ADAEC2-CB8E-4C5F-A73B-73E80ABAC334                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  What would be the most easy way to re-assign the missing space to OS X?
