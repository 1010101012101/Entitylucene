Download reading list as csv <body> I'm looking to download the reading list I've been populating from iOS (I think this is stored in iCloud), preferably in CSV format. Is this possible? I don't mind getting it in another format, but I'd prefer to get it from the web (I couldn't find iCloud's online interface, is that still a thing?) and not from iTunes.  <answer126055> Print the URLs of bookmarks and pages on the reading list:  codedefaults read ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist|sed -n 's/^ *URLString = "\(.*\)";/\1/p'/code  Print the URL, title, date added, and preview text for reading list items as CSV:  codesudo gem install plist csv;plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist|ruby -rplist -rcsv -e 'Plist.parse_xml(STDIN.read)["Children"].select{|e|e["Title"]=="com.apple.ReadingList"}[0]["Children"].each{|e|puts [e["URLString"],e["URIDictionary"]["title"],e["ReadingList"]["DateAdded"].strftime("%F %T"),e["ReadingList"]["PreviewText"]].to_csv}'/code  <comment147527> Do you want to be able to download it remotely, or just find it locally on your computer? If you have it synched to your desktop, then I think [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24864/is-it-possible-to-export-safaris-reading-list-on-safari-5-1) has a good solution for the latter case. <comment147641> The 'defaults' command was exactly what I was looking for, thanks! <comment169630> All of this is certainly very nice, but when you have already brought the file `.plist` on a Mac. I have my reading list on my iPhone. [How can I bring the reading list on a Mac, or on a PC ?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/143994/how-to-backup-and-access-ios-safaris-reading-list)
