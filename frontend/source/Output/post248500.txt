How can I get 2560X1080 resolution on my LG 29UM58 monitor, connected to a Mac Mini? <body> I just bought the LG 29UM58 21:9. My computer is a Mac Mini late 2012 (i7 model) running OS X 10.11  The display preferences just shows 1920x1080 16:9 than then is stretched out to 2560x1080 21:9.   SwitchResX software doesn't work? (Crashes? Runs but doesn't offer other resolution choices?)  I use a Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter.   How can I configure better resolution choices (ideally 2560 X 1080) for my setup?  <answer248503> You'll need a 1080 capable adapter or better. See this thread for some options.   ul liHow can a Mac mini drive 3440 pixels wide display instead of 1920?/li /ul  I'd get the cable matters 4K adapter over the 1080p one if you can afford the extra $4 cost.   Keep in mind HDMI spec as well for limits on resolution: Can a MacBook Air support 2560x1600 output via HDMI using a Mini DisplayPort/Thunderbolt to HMDI adaptor?  <comment308795> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/43796/discussion-on-answer-by-bmike-how-can-i-get-2560x1080-resolution-on-my-lg-29um58).
