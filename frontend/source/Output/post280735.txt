Outlook and notification center - remove deleted and read emails <body> I'm using Microsoft Outlook with macOS Sierra 10.12.4.  When I mark an email as read, or I delete it, the email is not removed from the notification center. Note that Outlook is configured to have the "Alerts" notification style.  Is there a way to resolve this issue?  <comment353122> I don't use Outlook, is it supposed to remove the emails from Notification Center after it's read?  I've used other email clients on my Mac and none of them have done this (that I recall).  [This behaviour](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/65371/88313) appears to have been going on for a while.
