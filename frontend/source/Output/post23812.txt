Which process is periodically writing to the disk? <body> Even when I am not doing anything on my Mac, I see a lot of Disk IO: "Data Written per Sec" in Activity Monitor showns continuous writes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DjMPS.png" alt="Disk Activity"  Is this normal? Why would some process continuously write? I understand there can be some housekeeping activities going on, the "Sleep image" being updated, but does this happen this frequently? (I have not set up Time Machine)  Edit: I have quite some free memory:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cZ3Ti.png" alt="Memory Usage"  <answer23813> A few things: (Written in bullet points to make it concise)  ul liThe OS itself writes./li liOpen applications write./li liBrowsers write as well, in the case of cookies, and when your RAM is maxed out./li /ul  <answer23875> I believe you should be able to use codelsof/code to check what processes are writing to the disk. Here's the man page for it.  <answer23910> You can get a better idea what's causing the activity with some of OS X's command-line tools:  codesudo iotop/code -- display of what processes are doing the most I/O, updated every 5 secs.  codesudo iosnoop/code -- shows I/O as it happens, including the process ID and process name doing the I/O, as well as data size, file path, etc  In both cases, you'll need to authenticate as an admin to run them, and use Control-C to exit.  They may not tell you precisely why the activity's happening, but they'll at least tell you what processes and files are involved, which usually narrows it down considerably.  <answer39731> In addition to codeiotop/code and codeiosnoop/code you may use codefs_usage/code.  precodesudo fs_usage -w -f filesys -e grep  | grep -i ' write ' /code/pre  <comment26604> Yes, I understand these. But how frequently? I have a lot of free RAM: Now around 5GB (added this detail to question as well) <comment26611> Can you share a screenshot of what's running under My Processes in Activity Monitor? <comment26646> Now (when I am back home from work) I see that the activity has come down (peak is around 900 KB/s). What was open in the morning is open now: Twitter App, Chrome and text edit (no changes made there. I typed something 4 days ago that I want to remember, but too lazy to save, and to think where to save) <comment26647> Will post a screenshot when I see a similar scenario. If I dont, will close this Q. <comment26740> Every second the computer is on. Computers always write to disk all the time. <comment26743> mega bytes every second? <comment26778> Depends on what OS you're using, what applications are open, ... <comment44884> `lsof` is a 'snapshot' based utility that shows everything going on within a few seconds time. IF you don't run it at the precise moment that the I/O is taking place, you'll miss it. OS X's utilities (`iotop` and `iosnoop` and numerous other users have answered with) are live/refreshing and very customizable utilities that I (IMO/personally) vastly prefer. <comment44886> This is a great answer. I would love it if you edited the highest scoring answer once you have the reputation to add this - it makes that answer much more complete.
