Within the Google+ app on your iPhone.  ul liTap the camera icon within the app./li liSelect your video from the Camera Roll./li liClick the blue arrow in the top-right corner./li liSelect some particular Recipients and maybe add some text./li liClick Share./li /ul  <answer225619> There are many different ways to do this. The first would be to plug in your phone to a mac, open photos and import your video then upload as you would normally would to Google+ in a browser. The other method to do this is to use airdrop to send your video to a computer and upload it. Find the video in the photos app on your phone, click share and select Airdrop. Make sure your Airdrop setting are on. Simply send it to your computer and then upload it normally in a browser. The last and probably most easiest method would be to via the Google+ app on your phone is:  Tap the camera in the Google+ app. Select the video you want to upload. Click the upload button in the top-right corner. Select your options for sharing Click Share and its uploaded.  <comment167136> I can upload recent videos, but videos taken before setting up google+ won't uploade to google+ account
