Starred folder showing up in Mail <body> I have a gmail account connected via IMAP to the iPhone 4. For some reason it shows a folder named "starred" which I cannot delete, move, nor find via the web interface in gmail. Can anyone tell me how to get rid of it?  Edit: in the properties of gmail, I have unchecked both "Important" and "Marked" folders via visible in IMAP, but that had no impact. Same goes for "All Mails", which I also cannot get rid of.  <answer86923> The starred folder is used for flagged e-mails. If you don't want this folder to show up in the mail.app you have to change the preferences directly in the Gmail web interface.  Go to empreferences/em and choose the emlabel/em tab. There you can uncheck emshow in IMAP/em. After the next synchronization, the folder should be gone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qq73v.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment100496> That field is unmarked, yet the folder still appears. <comment288207> This option does not show for Google Apps for Business accounts
