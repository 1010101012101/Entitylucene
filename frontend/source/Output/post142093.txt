Is there an equivalent to copernic pro desktop search engine available for mac? <body> Is there an equivalent  to copernic pro desktop search engine available for mac? I mean something serious not spotlight or found! Something that is able to search terabytes of data and index millions of keywords and search eminside/em pdfs and all sorts of data. I have searched and so far haven't found anything as good as copernic pro for mac.   <answer142096> Two that come to mind are :  EasyFind -- which is in the Mac App store   and  Docfetcher which is a java application  http://docfetcher.sourceforge.net/en/index.html  <comment167404> p.s more than happy to pay for it!
