Jumping between full screens in Yosemite? <body> I like having many full screens open (in the same ‘space’), but it bothers me that I have to press CMD+right twice to get from 1 to 3; it should be possible to jump directly to 3 with a shortcut like ctrl+3. Or is it?  PS. Sorry, I meant: can one jump between emspaces/em within the same desktop?  <answer205529> Yes, you can certainly do so.  ul liGo to strongSettings  Keyboard/strong/li liFrom there select strongShortcuts/strong/li listrongMission Control/strong/li liTick the boxes for the Desktops you want./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VTFjU.png" alt="Shortcuts"  hr / EDIT: One quick way to to move is to kbd⌘/kbd+kbdtab/kbd to switch between open applications.  Otherwise, you can submit feedback to Apple.  OS X 10.11 El Capitan will feature having a strongSplit View/strong which may be more convenient when rolled out.  <comment247844> Also note that if you have an extended keyboard, by default the ctrl/number you see is for the numbers above QWERTY, not the NumPad [10-key]. You need to specifically re-enter the NumPad numbers if that's what you wish to use. Also note that Fullscreened apps don't have Desktop numbers & cannot be directly accessed in this way. You need to 'number' to the nearest screen, then 'arrow' to the one you need. <comment247878> @bjbk: Thanks! I got my terminology mixed up, though, and meant to ask: can one jump between spaces within one desktop? I tried used several desktops before, but found it unpractical with full screens, as these use other spaces than the main desktops. <comment247893> Thanks to both of you for clearing that up. Use Command + Tab to quickly jump between full screen apps.
