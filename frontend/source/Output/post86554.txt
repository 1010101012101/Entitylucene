Dmesg shows no timestamp <body> The sudo dmesg command works fine, but shows no timestamp. Is there any way to get it to show the timestamps as well?   <answer86556> Not by using codedmesg/code which is a very simple command. But you can use  precodesudo fgrep "kernel[0]" /var/log/system.log /code/pre  instead to get the same messages from the system log file, including a time stamp.  <comment100029> The log info does show with timestamp in Console.app and system.log
