My early 2008 MacBookPro has a different DVI and the adaptor I need is not in stock anywhere <body> My early 2008 MacBookPro has a different DVI to later 2008 and the adaptor I need is not in stock anywhere  I am considering putting Apple TV from my Humax to enable my MacBook Pro to link wirelessly  <answer169898> As far as I know, the early 2008 MacBook Pros have a dual-link DVI socket, and don't need an adaptor at all for DVI output, just a DVI-D cable. The late 2008 models have Mini Display-Port, and need an adaptor to do DVI. Note, however, that DVI only carries video, not audio, so you'll need separate audio cabling if you want to do audio.  <answer169899> According to my research, it is called Micro DVI.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-DVI  It looks like it can be found here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z6Ore.jpg" alt="micro"  http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=micro+dvi+to+vga+adapter&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;index=electronics&amp;hvadid=25104013878&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=474849483470589268&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_4bxv9jd5o7_b  <comment199589> pictures would help - so we can see what the difference might be. There are, I think, 6 possibilities for a DVI plug/socket.
