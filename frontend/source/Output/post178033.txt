Hide the menu bar in Yosemite <body> Is it possible to completely hide the menu bar on an external monitor? I'm using my laptop with a projector, and while I can set the desktop background to completely black, the menu bar is still there. Even in dark mode there is still text. I would like to avoid showing any desktop UI if the presentation (Keynote) exits.  <answer178054> I think it's possibly 'Displays have separate Spaces' in System Prefs  Mission Control.br I've had that switched off since it was added to prefs, &amp; only have a menu bar on my main monitor.  supI don't want to switch it back to test, it messes things up ;-) /sup  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EkxK9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment210848> Turn it on to see you have the correct answer, then turn it back off. You won't mess anything up. ;-) <comment210849> @IconDaemon I have so many pre-designed Spaces in use, I don't dare ;) <comment210854> I don't want the wrath of @Tetsujin on my head if it **does** mess up. Well played.
