How to choose keys in keychain access? <body> I would like keychain access to store all my keys and passwords for my ssh accesses.  However, if I store too many keys, I get "Too Many Authentication Failures" since SSH will try to send all keys and passwords.  Is there a way to choose which key or password to send?  <answer136200> Put your per-server SSH-configuration into code~/.ssh/config/code like this:  precodeHost useKeyOnly.net user sshuser  Identityfile ~/.ssh/mykey1 IdentitiesOnly yes  Host usePasswordOnly.org PubkeyAuthentication no Port 53221 user root /code/pre  <comment161376> So you're saying that for one SSH-connection `ssh user@hostname` you have multiple passwords stored in your keychain? Shouldn't you only have one password for one user, or am I misunderstanding your question? Other than that could you maybe post the output of `ssh -vvv username@hostname` (after *redacting all sensitive information* like actual hostnames out of it)? This could help debug your session. <comment161490> @Asmus Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.  In my keychain, I have keys and passwords which will log to one single `ssh user@hostname`.  That said, when trying to authenticate, ssh will send ALL keys (in sequence) before trying password authentication.  If you have too many keys, you will eventually get the error above, not giving keychain the chance to try any stored password. <comment162443> I was aware of this configuration option and thanks for the input.  I was just hoping that I would be able to do without fiddling with ~/.ssh/config, since using keychain access is a very neat way to do without storing stuff in ~/.ssh ... ;)
