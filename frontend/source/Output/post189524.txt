I thought there may be way to reset its cache or any .plist from terminal. <comment224917> In general, software updates are a good first troubleshooting step. Get everything up to date and then see if the problem still happens. <comment224925> Ok. I will give a try. <comment233251> @user24601 - Updated to 10.10.3 didn't worked. Now i updated to 10.10.4 but unfortunately it is still crashing.. any suggestion?
