Why iTC app privacy policy is not optional anymore? <body> When I open some of my apps in iTunesConnect, I see that they are require privacy policy now (the app become edited, Save button is active, privacy policy field is highlighted): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lTaxV.png" alt="enter image description here" I have this problem only for particular apps. It started after iOS 10.3 update. Did I missed changes in iTunes Connect?  <answer280439> Sorry, I found answer by myself:  https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy     Apps that collect user or usage data must have a privacy policy and secure user consent for the collection. This includes—but isn’t limited to—apps that implement HealthKit or other health/medical technologies, HomeKit, Keyboard extensions, Apple Pay, Stickers and iMessage extensions, include a login, or access user data from the device (e.g. location, contacts, calendar, etc.).   My app is using HealthKit for workouts on Apple Watch (but not collect any data).  <comment352760> Do you collect any user data in your app? <comment352761> @fsb, no, I don't. <comment352790> I should've been more specific, health kit actually does collect user data whether you're using it or not.
