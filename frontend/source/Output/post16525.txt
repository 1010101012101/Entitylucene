iPad portable printer <body> I have a project running on a iPad and my client have decided to print a document on his clients and with that I'll need to find a portable printer for iPad.  I have searched on Canon and HP and nothing portable was found.  Does anyone here knows about one?  <answer16526> This is a list of all the iPad compatible printers. The only one that looks even somewhat portable is the first one.
