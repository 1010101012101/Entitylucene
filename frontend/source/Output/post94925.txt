How do I recover a HFS+ journaled drive? <body> EDIT: I found a quasi-solution that sort of kind of works:  precodemount -o loop,offset=209739776,rw -t hfsplus /dev/sdc /mnt/mountpoint/ /code/pre  It appears (via "find /mnt/mountpoint/") that all my data is there, but attempts to access some of my data yields an "input/output error".  I had an external 2 or 3 TB (I'm not sure which) USB drive connected  to my Mac (running OS X Snow Leopard) with an HFS+ journaled  filesystem on it.   The drive was working fine, but was a bit slow and occasionally gave  I/O errors, so I backed up my files and ran codefsck_hfs/code on it.   codefsck_hfs/code died while trying to rebuild the B-tree, and the drive won't  mount at all now. Also, I lied about making backups first.   How do I get this drive working again? Given the redundancy of HFS+,  this should be possible no? Other notes:   ul liIf I run codefsck.hfsplus -df /dev/sdb3/code on a Linux box, I get this: /li /ul  codepre  ** /dev/sdb3          Block 1565298166 is not an MDB or Volume Headerbr ** Checking HFS Plus volume.

If all else fails, I'll pursue recovering    files this way, but I'd prefer a "cleaner" recovery option.   <answer94936> DiskWarrior 4. It will run you $99. I've used DiskWarrior for several years and I'm very pleased with the results.  Data Rescue 3. $99. Similar to DiskWarrior, just an alternative program. Never used it before, but I've heard some good things about it. It's also sold in the Apple Store which gives it a lot of credibility.  <answer119403> even if this question is some time ago, for those who read it, I got another solution: Try testdisk, which is a cross-platform disk recovery tool. It helped me very often. http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download  Sorry for my bad english.  <comment111640> OK. I was hoping for a free option, but maybe there isn't a good one. <comment111643> @barrycarter Nope :) <comment146060> testdisk can help with restoring a partition table, but not repairing the actual filesystem in this case
