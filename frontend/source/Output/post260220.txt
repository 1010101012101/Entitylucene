iOS calendar doesn't sync in background <body> The iOS calendar app doesn't sync iCloud calendars anymore.  Example: I add calendar events on a mac, which uses the same iCloud calendars, and add a notification for in 5 minutes. In the past, my iPhone would notify me about this event though the set notification. This doesn't happen anymore as I now have to manually open the calendar app on my iPhone in order to make it sync the calendar events.  How can I fix this?  <answer260357> So the actual solution was to go to:  codeSettings &gt; Calendars &gt; Accounts &gt; Fetch New Data &gt; [My Account name] &gt;/codeand here tap on "Push".  Selecting "Push" in codeSettings &gt; Calendars &gt; Accounts &gt; Fetch New Data/code was not enough.  <comment325702> Check this: Settings  Calendars  Accounts  Fetch New Data set on Push? Is the battery icon yellow (thus Low Power Mode on)? And is the Background App Refresh toggle off? It appears that the last one only affects third party apps, but I'd check it to be sure. <comment325917> Thanks for the hints, everything is checked. <comment325921> Update: Actually, when I clicked on: Settings  Calendars  Accounts  Fetch New Data  My Account and here on "Push". Now this works. Only selecting it as you described above, like I did before, isn't to sufficient. <comment371024> I've never seen Settings - Calendar - Accounts.   I only see Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars - Accounts - iCloud ... then it's a dead end for Calendar settings. <comment371027> EDIT: Ok so its Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars - Fetch New Data - Choose account here - Then set Push <comment371028> I can see it. Perhaps the translation is different in german (which my iOS is set to). Edit: Well maybe I translated `Fetch New Data` wrong from german, here it says `Datenabgleich`.
