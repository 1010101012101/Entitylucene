Chrome desktop apps (extensions) won't launch at startup on OS X <body> I'm trying to figure out how to get a chrome desktop app (Kiosk) to launch at startup. I've gone to System Preferences  Accounts  Login items and added Kiosk (User  Applications  Chrome Apps  Kiosk) but it won't launch.   Any idea how to get these to launch properly at startup on OS X?  I do have an Automator application running at startup which executes a few node.js commands from a bash script, so maybe I could do it that way, but I'm not sure how.  If I go to the application icon and get info, I can see it says:   codeDefault afhcomalholahplbjhnmahkoekoijban.app/code under name and extension, and its location is /Users/mikeheavers/Applications/Chrome Apps.localized but if I attempt to run:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeopen -a Default /Users/mikeheavers/Applications/Chrome\ Apps.localized/afhcomalholahplbjhnmahkoekoijban.app /code/pre  from Terminal it says that the file doesn't exist  I was able to get this to work on a PC by looking at the Kiosk shortcut icon and copying the flags in the target field, then running a scheduled task that launched Chrome with those flags, but I can't find those flags on a Mac.
