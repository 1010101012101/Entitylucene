What's the maximum pid for Mac OS X? <body> The Mac OS X Internals book states that the maximum process identifier is 30,000 and after that the kernel will start re-using pids.  But checking on my own system, via:  codeps a | grep ps | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'/code  I can see that I have pids that go higher.  Does anyone know if there is a pid_max explicitly set somewhere, like in Linux?  <answer51124> Looking at sys/proc_internal.h in xnu-1699.24.23, I find that PID_MAX is 99999.  The value is used in kern_fork.c in the function codeforkproc/code.  Looking at that function, process IDs are not assigned equal to PID_MAX, so the highest possible pid is 99998.  <answer260798> Kyle's answer is still valid as of today. In case you want to verify that, here is a shell script:  precode#!/bin/bash  pid=0 for i in {1..100000}; do   : &amp;   if [ $! -lt $pid ]; then     echo "Min pid: $!"     echo "Max pid: $pid"     break   fi   pid=$! done /code/pre  This prints:  precodeMin pid: 100 Max pid: 99998 /code/pre  <comment58463> The book is out of date, it did use to be 30000 (xnu-792 - Tiger) and changed to 99999 when xnu-1228 was released (Leopard)
