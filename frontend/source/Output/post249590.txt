I can't update my Mac to El Capitan <body> For some reason, I can't update my MacBook Air to the new update "OS X El Capitan".br The update is on "pause" and I can't start it again, I simply cannot click on it.  I attached an image of what I see below.br Does anyone know how I can solve this? I've tried rebooting several times, but that seems to have no affect.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GPQGD.png" alt="download paused"  <answer249628> If you have a Time Machine Backup of your mac, you can boot it into Recovery Mode, and do a fresh install of the OS. Might solve the problem. Alternatively, it could be the amount of disk space left on your SSD.  <answer249632> It seems somehow version of OS X on your mac is corrupted. Try restoring it using utilities in OS X recovery system (built-in).    To start up from OS X Recovery, hold down Command (âŒ˜)-R immediately after turning on or restarting your Mac. Release when you see the Apple logo. If you can't start up from OS X Recovery, try holding down Option-Command-R to start up from OS X Internet Recovery. Startup is complete when you see the OS X Utilities window. Use one of the listed utilities to restore your mac.    ul liIf you have time machine backup, select Restore From Time Machine Backup. /li liOtherwise, select Reinstall OS X. OS X Recovery (Command-R) installs the version of OS X that was last installed on your Mac. OS X Internet Recovery (Option-Command-R) installs the version that originally came with your Mac./li liIf still not able to restore, browse the web and find help for your mac using safari (Get Online Help Option)./li /ul  <comment309723> The update is on "pause" or the download from iTunes? <comment309817> will this delete everything in my computer? <comment309821> the update says it's on *pause* but i can't click it, i can't click the button in app store either <comment309835> I meant App Store.  Oops.  What you need to do is delete the *Install OS X El Capitan" folder from `/Applications`.  In Terminal type `sudo rm -rf /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app` and you should be able to restart your download. <comment309842> This is going great - There's no sign of that folder in applications or in my computer at all. There's just that "button" i can't press.. <comment309862> No, If you have time machine backup (option 1). Otherwise using option 2, it will delete everything. There is one more option in OS X utility - disk utility. Maybe you can use that to see what's wrong with your disk.
