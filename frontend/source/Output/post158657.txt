How to get rid of "You have new mail." in zsh <body> I'm using zsh with prezto as my shell with iTerm as terminal app.  I always get the message "You have new mail" when opening a new prompt. I don't have any new mail in Mac Mail and I don't run a mail server.  How can I get rid of this message?  Thanks  <answer158658> So apparently some program (probably my MAMP) put an email in  precode/var/mail/ /code/pre  Deleting this message did the trick...  <answer200746> Whether codezsh/code checks for new mail can be adjusted through the codeMAILCHECK/code parameter as described in zshparam(1). It specifies the interval in seconds between checks for new mail, a zero turns off the checks completely. So just put this into your codezsh/code configuration file:  precode# don't check for new mail MAILCHECK=0 /code/pre  <answer267548> It tells you that you have received some mails (for example, because of your configuration of cron).   The best way is to read this mail. Type codemail/code: at least one mail should appear. You can read by typing its number ID. You can also directly delete it (or even multiple mails) by typing coded 1-1344/code (code1-13441/code being the range of your new mails' IDs). Leave codemail/code with codex/code.   <comment186505> You have mail in /var/mail - use the mail command to read <comment186509> ughâ€¦ I'd been seeing that in terminal for so long it felt like it was just its way of saying 'Hello". Nice find. <comment187276> So you feel like trashing the contents of your mailbox is a good idea? Do you also do this in real live? <comment187607> Well the mail in question was more a mistake by a local server. I am on Mac OS and my mails are stored somewhere else. So trashing this file was ok. If your actual mail is stored under /var/mail YOU SHOULD NEVER DO THAT... <comment361865> this doesn't work in `~/.zshrc` on mac OSX with `oh_my_zsh`. is there another zsh configuration file? is there a work around?
