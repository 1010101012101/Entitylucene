Connecting to Mac Mini via SSH unreliable <body> More often than not I am getting this error when connecting to a brand new Mac Mini, firewall disabled:  precodessh -l [username] [fixed_ip] ssh: connect to host [fixed_ip] port 22: Connection timed out ssh -l [username] [fixed_ip] ssh: connect to host [fixed_ip] port 22: No route to host /code/pre  (For security reasons, I have [fixed_ip] and [username] instead of the real values above.)  The connection does work sometimes, though. How can I make it more reliable?  <answer168510> Problem solved after disabling the screensaver and changing the energy saving options on the Mac Mini server.   <comment197587> The connection timed out and no route to host messages sounds like a DNS problem. Can you ping your Mac Mini by hostname and ip address? What happens when you try to ssh into the Mac Mini with "ssh username@hostname"? <comment197619> What kind of machine are you using to ssh into the Mac Mini? Does the Mac Mini have two network connections active? i.e wifi and ethernet? Did you set a static IP address on the Mac Mini or was it assigned via DHCP? Can you ping another machine from the Mac Mini? Are you on a small home network with just one router or is it a larger network? What OS version is the Mac Mini running?
