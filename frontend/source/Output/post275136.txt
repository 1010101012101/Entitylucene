How do I reset iCloud for a particular user? <body> I can get into the App Store from two other users on the same computer - a Mac Mini.  However, when I attempt to go to App Store, or iCloud on USER1 I get the message "there is an error signing into the Apple server." When I then logon as either USER2 or USER3, there is no problem.   What can I do to fix/reset/restore/redo whatever so I can go to the App Store and also use iCloud with USER1.   <comment346069> Can you please provide the exact version of macOS you're using? <comment346071> El Capitan 10.11.6. USER1, by the way, is the one that has access to the HardDrive, docs, etc., whereas the other two don't when I log in. They are pretty empty at this point. (One was a test so it's reallllly empty).
