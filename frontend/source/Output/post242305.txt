Install FreeBSD on xhyve <body> I want to install FreeBSD 10.3 as a virtual machine on my Mac mini with 10.11 via xhyve. I found this tutorial. But I don't get it to install. When I run the install script I get this error.  precodedlopen(/Library/Caches/Homebrew/xhyve--git/test/userboot.so, 4): image not found /code/pre  What do I do wrong? Also, maybe someone can explain to me, what the install script xhyverun-fbsdinstall.sh actually does.  <answer260758> The tutorial has an error. It refers to the codeuserboot.so/code file in the Homebrew source code cache, which may not be in the same place or existent on all systems with codexhyve/code installed.  A recent pull request into homebrew-core fixed this issue; that file is now in code$(brew --prefix xhyve)/share/xhyve/test/userboot.so/code.  You should do the tutorial as before, but with every line starting with codeUSERBOOT=/code   <comment297999> Just curious, why xhyve when VirtualBox is so much easier? <comment298007> I just to want look into it. Can't tell you more than you can lookup at xhyve.org <comment326494> The hypervisor framework in OS X is a [user oriented, *lightweight* hypervisor](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/251757/parallels-12-hypervisor-parallels-or-apple/259376#259376) meant for testing apps; this is the hypervisor that xhyve uses.  Personally, I think you going to expend a lot of energy trying to make something work on weak platform to begin with.
