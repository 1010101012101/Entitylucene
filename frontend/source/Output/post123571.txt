OS X Mavericks moving notification bar <body> I just got OS X Mavericks and the new notification bar (as seen in the right of this link) in the top right is bugging me. Is there a way to remove or move it, so the search bar is the first thing in the top right?  <answer123590> To kill the notification bar, type this:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist &amp;&amp; killall NotificationCenter /code/pre  If you want to renable it, type:  precodelaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist &amp;&amp; killall NotificationCenter /code/pre  As for moving it, so that the Spotlight function is first, I do not know. You can easily access Spotlight by keyboard using kbdâŒ˜ Command/kbdstrong+/strongkbdSpace/kbd and that will quickly open Spotlight, and you can just start typing without having to move your mouse.  <answer123596> You can do this with strongBartender/strong.  This allows you to rearrange and hide menu bar items, including items that Apple prohibit from moving such as Spotlight or Notification Center. It also lets you move items to a secondary bar or to be hidden until a keyboard shortcut is pressed.  <comment144413> I've read online about the command-space trick for spotlight, but it does nothing for me (Spotlight does not open, nothing changes). Any ideas? <comment144443> I knew about that, but it doesn't move it, so I didn't mention it. <comment144446> No, you can move icons, you need to hold down command while clicking on the icon. <comment144447> Ugh, I'm sorry. I didn't read your comment properly. My bad. :( <comment144449> All good :) (fills up character minimum)
