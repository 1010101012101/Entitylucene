iPhoto 10 : is there still a way to subscribe to rss feed? <body> I thought there was a menu entry in iPhoto to subscribe to RSS feeds.  I can't find it anymore. Is there still a way to do so in iPhoto 10 ?  <answer139791> This appears to have been removed. There's no mention of it that I can find in Apple's support documentation or iPhoto help (âŒ˜?) and the only reference to subscribing that I can find is subscribing to a Shared Photo Stream.  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this here:  ul lihttps://www.apple.com/feedback/iphoto.html/li /ul  <comment164735> Does pressing Command-key + U work? <comment164736> Sadly, no... I guess the functionality disappeared, but I would like to be sure. <comment164834> I added a feature request. Without any great hope, but who knows ? Looks like RSS is a technology for dinosaurs.
