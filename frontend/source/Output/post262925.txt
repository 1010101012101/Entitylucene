Mount a network drive autmatically on home and external networks. (SFTP) <body> I have a NAS on my home network which I can connect to no problem, however I want to be able to have it mount automatically to my MacBook on the go and at home.   So on my home network it has a local IP 192.168.x.x, when I want to access it from outside my network I need to use the public IP of my router for arguments sake 172.16.2.x which I have forwarded the port for SSH on so I can SSH/SFTP and so on.   Now I just need a method to auto-mount it when I am on an external network or my home network, Ideally with out the use of a VPN.
