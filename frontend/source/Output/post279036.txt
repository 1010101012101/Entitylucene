Configure Socks Proxy iPhone <body> I am currently in China and I would like to bypass the censorship. (Mostly for Google and Netflix)  I have a linux host in France that I could use for the SSH tunnel (let's call it user@domain.fr)  In my Mac Book Pro, I typed the command line  codessh -ND 9999 user@domain.fr/code, I configured my socks proxy, and everything worked fine.  strongFirst idea:/strong I tried to follow this tutorial  My Pac file is :  precodefunction FindProxyForURL(url, host) {       return "SOCKS domain.fr:9999"; } /code/pre  I put the file proxy.pac in my linux host via codescp/code command. When I checked the URL of the file with Mobile Safari, it displayed the code written above, so I guess it can access it.  Then I configured the iOS device (Proxy Http - Auto - URL...) but it didn't work. What's strange is that I can still access non-censored website (like Apple), but I can't access censored-one (Facebook, Twitter) I would have thought that configuring the Http Proxy to Auto would affect the whole Web Browser.  Anyway, I wonder if that's because I need an authentication to access my host. And if that's so, how could I make it work?  strongSecond idea:/strong : I tried port forwarding with this tutorial Since my basic needs are Google and Netflix, I used Termius and configured the port forwarding as followed :  Port Forwarding  Local  Host : domain.fr:22 Port from : 9998 Destination : google.com Port to : 80  Port Forwarding  Local  Host : domain.fr:22 Port from : 9999 Destination : netflix.com Port to : 80  Then I tried to access via localhost:9998 and localhost:9999.  For Netflix, I have a Http Status 404 : the requested resource is not available. For Google, I have a Http Status 404 : the requested URL was not found on this server.
