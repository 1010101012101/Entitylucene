Running shell scripts in single-user mode <body> I'm planning on running a couple of scripts in single-user mode to speed up (and simplify for less savvy users than myself) the configuring of a few aspects of some Macs that I set up for other people.  I've read the few threads I could find about this, and my question is simply is there anything I should be particularly aware of when it comes to running scripts from single-user mode?  I'm aware that I can't invoke any commands/apps that would require a GUI to load, and that the code/sbin/fsck/code and code/sbin/mount/code commands would still be required before a script can be run at all.  Two more specific questions: If I set the script as executable before depositing it on the disk image that will be booted in single-user mode, will it remain executable?   And lastly, when it comes to removing user accounts I've seen on some threads e.g this one the need to invoke this command:  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist /code/pre  However, as I simply want to coderm/code various files - is there any need to do this, the process emseems/em to work just fine without it?  <answer198144> Yes, files flagged as executable will still be executable under Single User Mode.  opendirectoryd is just for handling logins/authentication and using root doesn't require that, and you don't need to launch it if you just intend to manage files.  <comment237039> Perfect, thanks very much! Will try to up-rep you etc once mine is high enough!
