Toolbar keeps hiding on Safari <body> I am trying to keep the toolbar visible all the time....when I select 'View' the 'Hide Toolbar' is grayed out.  My wife has the same machine, and her's has 'Hide toolbar' not grayed out which I assume she could select and would get the result I am getting.  Any help would be appreciated, it's getting annoying now.  <answer147332> If you're in full screen mode, this behavior is normal (the hide toolbar option greyed out, not the lack of visible toolbar contents).

Go to bottom. Exit full screen and resize the window to fit frame.  <answer209238> You are in "Full Screen" mode.
