What Flickr channel is Apple TV using as its default screensaver? <body> I have the latest hardware version of Apple TV and fully updated software. As a screensaver, it shows some Flickr images. However, I haven't logged in to Flickr, so the setting is still default.  Can anybody give me a hint as to what Flickr channel these screensaver pictures are coming from?
