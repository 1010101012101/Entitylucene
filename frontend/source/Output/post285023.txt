Can I specify in what window of an application new files are opened into? <body> I would like to know if there is a way to change the window of an application that opens a new file (for example in Safari after a URL is clicked, or for a text editor such as Textastic after a text file has been double-clicked).  I work with multiple windows and find it annoying when specific files open in a different window to what I'd like. I'm hoping there is a way to change this.  <comment359427> The Safari example  I understand, but the text editor example I do not. What I mean is I cannot think of an example of a text editor that will open a new file in an existing window. Can you explain further? <comment359431> I use Textastic a lot, and when I have multiple windows (with each containing multiple tabs) opened and I double click a file it always opens as another tab in one window although I want it to open in the other window.
