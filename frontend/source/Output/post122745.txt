Why does my path not get saved even after editing ~/.bashrc? <body> I've added maven to my path, but it doesn't seem to be persisting to the path beyond the lifetime of the terminal application.  I've modified my code~/.bashrc/code, but it still isn't storing the modified path.   Here is my code~/.bashrc/code:  precodeexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7` export PATH=$PATH:/Users/chris/Dev/Libraries/apache-maven-3.1.1/bin /code/pre  And here is the result of codeecho $PATH/code:  precodechriss-macbook:~ chris$ echo $PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin /code/pre  Why isn't my modified path getting persisted between terminal sessions, and how can I solve that?  <answer122746> OS X Terminal does not source ~/.bashrc.
