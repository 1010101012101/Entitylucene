iPhoto create an album for every event <body> I recently purchased a new iMac and imported my entire photo collection into iPhoto (about 40000 photos). These were organized as folder YYMMDD - Event Name, about 1000 folders in total. iPhoto imported every folder as an event, which is great. However I would like to organize the photos hierarchally, nesting them by year. Is there any Apple Script or something I can run that will create one album for every event I have (I know I can drag the events one by one into the sidebar but that will take approximately two forevers to do. Is there a more efficient way?
