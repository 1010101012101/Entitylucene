OpenVPN missing parameter on OSX 10.11 El Capitan <body> I have a problem setting up VPN connection between my MacBook Pro with OSX 10.11 and my VPS with OpenVPN. The server is working correctly because I am using in on my iPhone with iOS 9.0.2, android 4.2 box and iMac with OSX 10.10. On OSX 10.11 I am getting this error using Tunnelblick:     2015-10-12 21:13:27 *Tunnelblick: OS X 10.11.0; Tunnelblick 3.6beta10 (build 4400); prior version 3.5.4 (build 4270.4395)      2015-10-12 21:13:28 *Tunnelblick: Attempting connection with macbook-pro; Set nameserver = 1; monitoring connection      2015-10-12 21:13:28 *Tunnelblick: openvpnstart start macbook-pro.tblk 1337 1 0 3 0 16688 -ptADGNWradsgnw 2.3.7      Options error: Unrecognized option or missing parameter(s) in /Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Shared/macbook-pro.tblk/Contents/Resources/config.ovpn:1: macbook-pro (2.3.7)                                           Use --help for more information.      2015-10-12 21:13:28 *Tunnelblick: openvpnstart starting OpenVPN   The config.ovpn that is causing the problem looks like this:  precodemacbook-pro dev tun proto udp remote vps-server-ip 1194 resolv-retry infinite nobind persist-key persist-tun comp-lzo verb 3 tls-server  &lt;ca&gt;  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- -----END CERTIFICATE----- &lt;/ca&gt; &lt;key&gt;  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- -----END PRIVATE KEY----- &lt;/key&gt;  &lt;cert&gt;  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- -----END CERTIFICATE----- &lt;/cert&gt; /code/pre  Of course certificates are populated with proper certs and IP is also correct.  Have you got any suggestions?  <answer216869> Seems like the codemacbook-pro/code "option" is not recognised by openvpn...  Remove this line or comment it out.  <comment256916> In your config.ovpn is your first line: "macbook-pro"? It looks like this one is unneded (and unsupported) parameter, perhaps your copy-paste mistake.
