How can I use a keyboard shortcut to go to my Dropbox folder <body> How can I change the Finder keyboard shortcut kbdcommand/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdD/kbd to open my Dropbox folder instead of the Desktop folder.  <answer51504> I can get you most of the way there, but I'm going to say straight off that I don't know how to hijack the kbdshift/kbd-kbdcmd/kbd-kbdD/kbd shortcut.  However, if you're willing to settle for a different shortcut...  ol liOpen Automator/li liCreate a new Service/li liChange the service to receive "no input" in "Finder"/li liDrag in the "Get Specified Finder Items" action/li liAdd a new path to your Dropbox folder in this action/li liDrag in the "Open Finder Items" action/li liSave as something like "Open Dropbox"/li /ol  It should look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ISBAH.png" alt="Open Dropbox Service"  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liSelect "Keyboard"/li liSelect "Keyboard Shortcuts"/li liSelect "Services"/li liScroll down to the bottom and select your "Open Dropbox" service/li liClick the "add shortcut" button to specify a new shortcut/li /ol  I tried to come up with a way to override the shortcut for the Desktop menu item, but I was unable to do so.  So this will get you a hotkey to open your Dropbox folder when you're in the Finder, but it won't be via kbdshift/kbd-kbdcmd/kbd-kbdD/kbd.  <answer51505> System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  select Application Shortcuts in the left column  click the "+" button  Application = Finder, Menu Title = Dropbox, Keyboard Shortcut = whatever you like  click Add  test it out. worked great for me from Finder  Note that this uses the Finder's "Go to  Recent Folders" Submenu. If the Folder isnÂ´t in the List (and there's no way to keep it there), you won't be able to jump to it.   <answer51515> Use Spark to run an AppleScript:  precodetell application "Finder"     open ((home as text) &amp; "Dropbox") end tell /code/pre  In Spark, go to FileNew HotkeyAppleScript and set your settings as such: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqwmW.jpg" alt=""  (You can also use Spark to run a shell script, but I'd recommend using this method, as a shell script is a bit more complicated)  <answer189139> here's a method that I implemented that allowed opening the Dropbox folder from within any application (well, it gets called by a Terminal session from the Finder).    This does not however, automatically switch to the Dropbox folder while in the middle of a application dialog box;  it simply opens up the Dropbox folder in the event you need to look into or open something within the Dropbox folder.  To access the Dropbox folder from an application dialog box, you can drag the Dropbox folder into the "Favorites" section of the application save/open dialog box to access it within one click.  Ok, if you're still interested in a hot-key anyway to access the dropbox folder,  here's how to do it:  ol liOpen Automator: Cmd-Spacebar, type in Automator./li liSelect Service, click Choose/li liModify "Service receives selected [text] in [any application]" to:  "Service receives [no input] in [any application]"/li liSelect the action "Run Shell Script" under Utilities, drag it over to the right pane./li liChange the "cat" command to "open ~/Dropbox".  If your Dropbox folder is located somewhere else, please modify the pah accordingly./li liSave as "Open Dropbox Folder"/li liOpen System Preferences: Cmd-Spacebar, type in System Preferences/li liNavigate to Keyboard - Shortcuts/li liScroll down to General/li liEnsure the checkbox for "Open Dropbox Folder" is checked (enabled)./li liChoose the Keystroke combination to open the Dropbox folder. NOTE:  If you choose Option-Cmd-D, you may need to disable "Turn Dock Hiding On/Off" in the Launchpad  &amp; Dock section./li /ol  Enjoy!  <comment58872> This is good, for sure, however will it work from any finder window such as when I'm saving a file?
