how to use terminal to remove item from dock <body> Hi I have a shell script in my login item , which runs whenever i log in to my system . It does work completely but once it exits the terminal , it leaves the terminal shortcut on my dock and I don't want that I want my dock to be clean and want only my required application in it.Is there any command which I can keep at the end of my script so that once the script executes completely it also remove terminal from my dock.   <answer125922> Try to run the script with launchd instead. Save a property list like this as code~/Library/LaunchAgents/some.label.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;some.label&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;/path/to/script&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  It should run the script the next time you log in. Make sure the script is executable (codechmod +x /path/to/script/code) and starts with a hashbang line (like code#!/usr/bin/env bash/code).  <comment147110> I think Terminal.app is actually still running and you need to quit it, not modify the Dock. If that’s your issue, [Automatically quit Terminal when typing exit](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3066/automatically-quit-terminal-when-typing-exit) should answer your question. <comment147123> Enable it in Preferences , for "exit" command to take effect and quit Terminal <comment147126> I already have the exit command at the end of my scripts and also after shell execution the terminal get close but it left the link to re open the terminal i think its a mac feature to left the recent open apps in dock . and i already had set the preferences
