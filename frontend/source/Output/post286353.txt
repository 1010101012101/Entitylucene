How to read passwords and notes from keychain on non-apple OS? <body> I see one solution — install macOS on virtual machine and do the job in it, but installing macOS in a VM is a huge PITA, even if I find where to download the os distribution. So I am asking for better ways.  Do you know of any software which can read data from keychains and is not tied to macOS-specific functionality?  (I am asking because my MacBook™ died too early, and nobody can fix it where I live, and of course I decided to not buy anything from Apple ever again because this hardware quality is unacceptable. So I need some way to get my passwords and stuff from backups…)  P.S. Maybe it's not the most appropriate stackexchange site to ask this question, but I can't decide where is the best place, so I am sorry if it's misplaced.  Also, to be clear: I know the password of keychain so it's not about cracking, etc.  <answer286356> According to some sources another Mac or a VM running macOS/OS X is required to dump your macOS keychain.  You can then convert the data and import it in e.g. 1Password with a perl script.  hr  If you have problems finding another Mac, send me your login.keychain from the backup and its password ;-).  <comment361281> I may be stupid because I bought a mac once, but not stupid enough to give up passwords ;D
