Educational Volume Purchase and B2B (iOS apps) <body> Can the Educational Volume Purchase Program work with apps developed and distributed through the B2B program?  The WWDC session video on it mentioned education once, but it only talked specifically about distributing the apps through the regular Volume Purchase Program, which requires a DUNS number.  <answer55483> Answer from telephone support: yes.  The B2B program interfaces with the Educational Volume Purchase Program the same way the regular Volume Purchase Program does.
