Can I make my Mac OS X Terminal color items according to syntax, like the Ubuntu terminal? <body> I want it to have all the colors for syntax folders, etc... How can I do that?  <answer9822> geekology.co.za has an informative blog post on how to do this, "Enabling Terminals directory and file color highlighting in Mac OS X". In case it gets moved or deleted, the basics are:  Add to your .bashrc or .profile:  precodeexport CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=ExFxCxDxBxegedabagacad /code/pre  Save the file. Open a new terminal and use  precodels ls -l ls -la ls -lah /code/pre  The rest of the article has info on what the colors do and how to change them (the letters you assign to LSCOLORS is what controls what colors you see).  <answer9825> h2My terminal colors/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/evv1M.png" alt="terminal color examples"  h2how to do it/h2  h3download theme/h3  from here: http://media.tannern.com/tanner.terminal  h3import into Terminal/h3  After installing SIMBL and the correct terminalcolors you can import my terminal theme from the Terminal Preferences window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ho1SY.png" alt="where to find the import option"  h2other tweaks/h2  Adding this to the file code~/.profile/code will make codels/code color it's output by default.  precode# Make ls use colors export CLICOLOR=1 alias ls='ls -Fa' /code/pre  Adding this will define colors as variables to make a prompt easier to edit.  precode# define colors C_DEFAULT="\[\033[m\]" C_WHITE="\[\033[1m\]" C_BLACK="\[\033[30m\]" C_RED="\[\033[31m\]" C_GREEN="\[\033[32m\]" C_YELLOW="\[\033[33m\]" C_BLUE="\[\033[34m\]" C_PURPLE="\[\033[35m\]" C_CYAN="\[\033[36m\]" C_LIGHTGRAY="\[\033[37m\]" C_DARKGRAY="\[\033[1;30m\]" C_LIGHTRED="\[\033[1;31m\]" C_LIGHTGREEN="\[\033[1;32m\]" C_LIGHTYELLOW="\[\033[1;33m\]" C_LIGHTBLUE="\[\033[1;34m\]" C_LIGHTPURPLE="\[\033[1;35m\]" C_LIGHTCYAN="\[\033[1;36m\]" C_BG_BLACK="\[\033[40m\]" C_BG_RED="\[\033[41m\]" C_BG_GREEN="\[\033[42m\]" C_BG_YELLOW="\[\033[43m\]" C_BG_BLUE="\[\033[44m\]" C_BG_PURPLE="\[\033[45m\]" C_BG_CYAN="\[\033[46m\]" C_BG_LIGHTGRAY="\[\033[47m\]" /code/pre  Adding this will give you a multi-line colored prompt.  precode# set your prompt export PS1="\n$C_LIGHTGREEN\u$C_DARKGRAY@$C_BLUE\h $C_DARKGRAY: $C_LIGHTYELLOW\w\n$C_DARKGRAY\$$C_DEFAULT " /code/pre  For a list of escape sequences to use in prompts check this article  <answer20631> As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal allows you to customize the sixteen ANSI colors and also supports the 256-color palette.  So, installing SIMBL or other extensions to get more colors is no longer necessary.  <answer139939> People may want to check out zsh + prezto. There's a nice guide here. zsh is already installed in OSX. Prezto just adds stuff to your shell. Activate the syntax-highlighting module, and go to town :)  <comment10285> +1 for not simply linking to the answer and including the core of it here. <comment17282> Also see [Colorizing your terminal and shell environment?](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/148/colorizing-your-terminal-and-shell-environment) on [unix.stackexchange.com](http://unix.stackexchange.com/). <comment56393> (Link is broken to http://media.tannern.com/stackoverflow/Tanner%202.terminal) <comment164861> The link supplied in your answer is gone. <comment164888> Fixed 2 years later :) <comment165254> I've since stopped using Apple's Terminal application in favor of iTerm2 ( http://www.iterm2.com ) I prefer it's split windows over tabs and it does not need any hacks to support correct coloring (although I haven't used Apple's Terminal in some time and it may no longer need the hack listed above) <comment227277> Can I use this theme for gnome shell? If yes how can I do? Thanks a lot. <comment248798> @rennat The problem with posting links to blog posts is that they go away and are unreliable, please update this post with the instructions from your blog <comment250221> @surfer190 I removed the link to that guys blog post since it's no longer necessary to patch terminal for proper color support. <comment312236> quick. simple. easy.  thank you. <comment315961> Looks like the link to the guide is broken. Giving a 404 :( <comment339498> @Eric Thanks, I fixed the link.  Also see the follow-up article [here](http://mikebuss.com/2014/04/07/customizing-prezto)
