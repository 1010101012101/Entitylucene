Auto or manual refreshing of mounted volumes <body> I use Transmit to mount a Linux server disk on my Mac.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ae3cN.png" alt="enter image description here"  The issue is that when I do something on the remote server with ssh, the change is not reflected in the mounted volume in my mac.  How can I manually/automatically update the changes?  <answer119207> You can refresh using the refresh command in the Transmit Disk menu bar item.     h2Transmit 4.1.1/h2      h3Released on 9/14/10/h3      ul   liTransmit Disk has been improved dramatically!   ul   liâ€¦/li   liAdded a new 'Finder Refresh' command Transmit Disk menu to reload Finder file listings/li   /ul/li   /ul   <comment139041> I works for Finder, but not for PathFinder.
