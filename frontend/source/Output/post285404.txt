Wake up external hard drive <body> When mac goes to sleep mode, it also disables external hard drive. But sometimes after mac has been waked up the external hard drive stays asleep. How do i wake it up? It's connected, and when i'm opening it, i can browse directories i've visited recently. However, other directories appear to be empty. Hard drive is definitely not spinning. Any attempts to write or read files from the hard drive throws errors.  codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage 4TB BLACK               4.0 TB     disk2s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3 /dev/disk3 (external, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS 4TB BLACK              +4.0 TB     disk3                                  Logical Volume on disk2s2                                  70BFF792-2AA7-47D4-99F7-674CB500683E                                  Unlocked Encrypted /code/pre  <comment359907> Issue the command `diskutil list` and post the output.  Does your drive show up? <comment359938> @Allan i've pasted the part of output related to this hard drive <comment360005> So, your *external* hard drive is an Apple boot drive?  If you unplug, does disk2 and/or disk3 go away?
