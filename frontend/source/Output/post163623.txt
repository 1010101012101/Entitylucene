Mac preventing loading Java site <body> I am trying to administer my Western Digital MyBookLife home network drive, using the Java based admin console provided by WD. The console is a web application served up from the drive itself.  However, since I upgraded to Java 8, the Mac is preventing me from loading the page (a Java applet), which is on my network at code192.168.1.2/code  I opened the Java console and added codehttp://192.168.1.2/code to my trusted network site list, however it is still rejecting me.  The message says   precodeApplication Blocked by Java Security Name: WDTester Location http://192.168.1.2 Reason: Your security settings have blocked an untrusted application from running. /code/pre  Also, I am getting another prompt that says again "Application Blocked by Java Security" but this time it says reason: Your security settings have blocked an application signed with an expired or not-yet-valid certificate from running  I see in the Java Control Panel the exception site list containing my host, as specified above (I also added the same with https protocol, and I also added localhost just to be sure.) But for some reason, it is ignoring the exceptions.  What to do??  <comment191619> what version is your WD MBL? <comment191622> I don't know. I can't get in to the admin page, and it is not marked on the case. I am trying to upgrade the firmware, but it also requires the admin page <comment191623> Have you tried the WD MY Cloud.app for Mac?  I don't believe it relies on Java.   http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=902&sid=184&lang=en <comment191631> Are you using Safari ?? - if Yes, then try to set your local site to unsafe mode, as described here: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202819
