Faster than Time Machine for Backup <body> I want to do a full backup of my Mac to an external disk AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.  Does that mean I should use something other than Time Machine or set some settings?  <answer80598> It depends on what your full usage scenario is. For a one-off full image Time Machine is not very well suited, you are better of with using  ul lithe disk imaging functionality in Disk Utility/li liSuperDuper/li liCarbon Copy Cloner/li /ul  If you are looking for having a full image of your drive updated regularly, fast and hassle-free, Time Machine is a good way to do that. The initial backup will just take a while longer, the incremental ones will be rather fast.  <comment92998> and rsync? is there any compelling reason to use SuperDuper or CCC over rsync? <comment93001> AIUI CCC's sync feature actually uses a specially updated & patched version of rsync -- see [CCC author Mike Bombich's rsync notes](http://afp548.com/static/mactips/rsync.html). I'm not sure about speed, but I think it does a slightly better job of preserving file attributes than the Apple-supplied rsync version.
