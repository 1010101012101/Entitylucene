Remove downloads or remove from library for duplicate playlist? <body> I have a playlist that I sync between iTunes and my iPhone on iOS 10.3.1. Sometimes I see that a playlist gets duplicated with the number 1 after the name. I want to delete the duplicated playlist from my iPhone, but I get a concerning dialog, asking if I want to remove downloads ore remove the playlist from the library.  I'm not quite sure what it's asking. Can someone explain this? Any downloaded songs from iTunes I want to stay on the phone as part of the original playlist and in general, but I want that second playlist itself to disappear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zhU3.jpg" width="320" alt="remove playlist dialog"  <answer283951> strongRemove Downloads/strong will leave the playlist in your library, but remove the music files associated with the songs in that playlist from your phone, thus freeing up storage. It's a quick method to bulk-remove songs from your phone.  strongDelete from Library/strong will remove the playlist itself from your media library (including iCloud Music Library if you use iTunes Match or ï£¿MUSIC). However whatever music files you've already downloaded will remain on your phone.  In your case, you should strongDelete from Library/strong if you are certain the playlist is a duplicate.  <comment358102> You were right thank you
