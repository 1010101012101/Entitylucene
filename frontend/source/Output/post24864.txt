Is it possible to export safari's reading list on Safari 5.1? <body> Subject sums it up. Just curious if there is a trick to be able to export your reading list from Safari, any format. Where on the HD is the info stored? bookmarks.plist?  <answer24876> Yes. The file is called codeBookmarks.plist/code and it is located in code~/Library/Safari//code. This houses not only your Reading List bookmarks, but all your bookmarks.  You'll want to look for entries under the key codeReadingList/code. They will look something like this (file viewed in xCode 4):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2xC1u.png" alt="enter image description here"  Unfortunately, the plist file is stored as a binary, and you'll either have to open it using xCode or another tool that can handle binary plist files.  <answer62431> You can convert it into XML in a Terminal/command window using:  precodecd ~/Library/Safari/ cp Bookmarks.plist Bookmarks.plist.xml   plutil -convert xml1 Bookmarks.plist.xml /code/pre  <answer136215> You can't export from Safari but you can import from Chrome  Here it is on Google support: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en  Alternatively you can open the Terminal application on a Mac (search it in Launchpad if you can't find it) and paste this:  precode/usr/bin/plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist | grep -E  -o '&lt;string&gt;http[s]{0,1}://.*&lt;/string&gt;' | grep -v icloud | sed -E 's/&lt;\/{0,1}string&gt;//g' /code/pre  Hit return and it will list all your Reading List links as text which you can copy and paste elsewhere.  <answer155529> In OS X Yosemite, go to ~/Library/Safari/ReadingListArchives  <comment27973> I'll bet that once the iCloud drops, we'll see this sync between your computers automatically. Not sure if that was where you're going with this, but it's semi-related. <comment169636> [I have this question for Safari on iOS.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/143994/how-to-backup-and-access-ios-safaris-reading-list)
