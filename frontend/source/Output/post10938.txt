Trying to install vsftpd via mac ports on snow leopard <body> Using this guide: http://www.finiteloops.com/weblog/?p=79  I get this error:  precode500 OOPS: vsftpd: not configured for standalone, must be started from inetd /code/pre  I am trying to turn on and off LISTEN in the config, but how to either link VSFTPD with INET or XINET or let it start in listen mode?  <answer10940> The man page for the config file for codevsftpd/code should be of some help. If you set codelisten=YES/code in the config file, then codevsftpd/code will be configured to run in standalone mode. It will then not be needed to be run from codeinetd/code or codexinetd/code.   However, if you don't wish to run codevsftpd/code in standalone mode, you will have to look at the man pages for codelaunchd/code and launchctlcodeto figure out how to set up/codevsftpdcodeto load via/codelaunchdcode. The/codexinetcodesystem was replaced with/codelaunchd` on Snow Leopard.  <answer14288> Have you tried adding codelisten=yes/code in your config file?  <comment11465> rantThis is really making me miss my Ubuntu setup.  I still can't figure out why people say Mac is great for developing, it is pretty, but Ubuntu is so straightforward with it's package management, Mac has all these hacks like homebrew and port to get around it's lack of integrated package management./rant <comment11466> I didn't realize launchd was also a replacement for xinetd.  I used lingon and it shows this as the plist: http://pastebin.com/YwDygW1c It is not disabled, but there is no entry for which port will trigger the call to this program.  Is this setup better on homebrew?  But I don't have xcode and have no desire to install xcode just for an ftp server. <comment11467> I gave up on trying to get it working xinetd style and enabled LISTEN.  (I had to use lingon to see the name of the config file it was using, i had .config instead of .conf).  It is working now.  Thanks. <comment15393> There's a new package manager called: [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), you might want to give it a try. It's easier than MacPorts and Fink: [Homebrew: OS Xâ€™s Missing Package Manager](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/homebrew-os-xs-missing-package-manager/).
