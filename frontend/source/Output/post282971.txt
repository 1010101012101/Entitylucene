I can't upgrade my OS until I change my icloud drives settings <body> I have an Apple 2011 laptop. I haven't done any recent updates and nor have I downloaded anything either. My computer needs to upgrade to the next OS but it is saying that a change has to be made to my iCloud settings before I can use my App Store. I have no idea what this could mean.   I tried upgrading my credit card info on my Apple account and rebooting the laptop, to no avail. I also deselected some of the items in iCloud, but to be really honest am less familiar with Macs than PCs.  What do I need to do so I can upgrade my Mac?  <answer282975> Apple provides free support for basic use of the Mac App Store and basic iCloud support, so I would start with them.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541/li lihttps://support.apple.com/icloud/li /ul  Once you have some expert help on narrowing down what specifically you need to change / opt in / enable on your iCloud / Apple ID - then you will be able to see what / why you can't use the Mac App Store to download a new update. You probably have a few bridges to cross so try to pick apart specific messages and error conditions or specific things you can't find online if you ask a follow on question here.  <comment356691> Welcome to Ask Different.
