Weeks after updating to iOS 10.0.1, all but ~5 most recent messages disappeared, and messages would no longer organize by time <body> I did not update again just before this happened. I was having trouble loading some apps, so I powered off and powered on my phone, and then found that the most recent message from about four people was all that was left on my phone, plus one empty text conversation with no messages. At the same time, the most recent several months of photos disappeared, though not all of my photos. (The missing messages covered a much longer timespan than the missing photos.) In the past I've experienced older messages temporarily not appearing, but after several days they had not returned. Additionally, the organization of text conversations was nonsensical. If I received/sent a text from/to any person not in those five that had remained, the new conversation would be inserted into the list in a random place. Wherever a text conversation was in the list is where it would remain--rather than being sorted with the newest messages at the top, I would just have to scroll to wherever there were unread messages.  Eventually, I updated to 10.0.2, hoping that some of my problems would resolve. The misordering problem has disappeared, but so have all of my messages, again. This time, instead of all but 5, it was every single one that disappeared, and all text conversations in the list. All of my apps, notes, and settings, as well as whatever photos had not gone missing originally, are still on my phone since updating.
