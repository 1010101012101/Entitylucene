AppleScriptObjC Path to .app <body> I am currently setting up an AppleScriptObjC application. Whenever I try other methods, it screws up. I'm trying to set it up where a shell script uses the mv command to move a file from the "Files" directory to the /usr/bin/ folder. I think it would go a little something like:  precodedo shell script "sudo mv " &amp; path &amp; "/Files/ /usr/bin/" /code/pre  where codepath/code would be the path to me. I have tried the path to me and posix and other stuff, just doesn't work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUX6w.png" alt="The Files folder contains a file I want to move to /usr/bin"  <comment227172> How does it fail? <comment227174> @Mark , It fails because i want it to get the path to the "Files" folder in the .app. With that code, it's looking at root for "Files" I don't know how to set the path to the .app itself. <comment227179> @Mark I need to find a way to set "path" to the path to my app. <comment227182> You need yp look at the ObjC classes - this question looks too bras as part from that your shell script call should use the app script admin privileges rather than sudo and use [NSFilemanager](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac//documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSFileManager_Class/index.html) to move files
