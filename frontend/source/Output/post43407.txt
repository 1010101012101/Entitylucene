What is the wattage of my iPhone? <body> I am trying to make a transportable charger for iPhones, but before I can start this I need to know how much power my iPhone uses when I make an emergency call.    If nobody knows this, I will be glad to have any information related to this.  <answer43411> The power use is going to vary somewhat depending on external factors on the RF side. Network mode in use (GSM/3G) and the power required to establish a stable connection to the cell site in use together with any other usage on the device (speaker/bluetooth/GPS)  Best guess is that your baseline should be the specified 1A required to charge the device and work up/down from there with a meter connected  <answer43442> Anandtech has some nice charts detailing the wattage of the iPhone 4S running various apps, which could be a good starting point for you.   You may also want to check out existing kits/projects, such as MintyBoost - they seem to work reasonably well with iPhones. There's a specific MintyBoost page detailing Apple device charging that may also yield some useful info.  <comment61425> +1 for the mintyboost link. Explains things very well
