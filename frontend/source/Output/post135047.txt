PDF presentation software that shows notes <body> I created a PDF presentation in latex using beamer and I added notes to some slides. Now I want to show my presentation using a projector. What I need is to show the slides on the projector while see the notes on my laptop. Usually I create my presentation on Powerpoint and it supports a Presentation mode by default for its files. However I'm not able to find an app that does this to PDF documents!  I'v tried these apps but they are all out of date and didn't work: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfslide/  https://code.google.com/p/splitshow/  <comment160062> Maybe you should ask this at `TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange`.
