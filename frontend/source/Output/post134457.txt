Moved iPhoto Library: Need to point iMovie in the right direction <body> my friend has moved her iPhoto 08 Library from an external HD. She has some iMovie 08 projects which reference iPhoto movies.  How can I update iMovie to the new location of the iPhoto library. We no longer have access to the external HD.  <answer134481> Locate the iPhoto library in Finder, drag and drop it to iMovie's project pane?  <comment159426> This works in part, iMovie now recognises the new library. Unfortunately the video references are still broken. Good try though.
