Which apps support mobile Safari's "Shared Link" Feature? <body> Does anybody know which apps are supported for iOS "Shared Links" on iOS? Currently on my iPhone it is only Twitter (see screenshot) and RSS feeds which can be added directly from within Safari.  OS X seems to support many different accounts, iOS looks a bit poor.  Are there any other apps / accounts which can be used? Is there a list somewhere?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZthP.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Subscriptions tab on Mobile Safari"
