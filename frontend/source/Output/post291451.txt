Tried to remove Ubuntu partitions and now a 1MB partition appeared and won't erase <body> So I was trying to remove my Ubuntu partitions (3GB Swap Partition and 15GB Main) after that a partition named "FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF" appeared that's 1MB and will not remove or format. Im trying to merge my macOS partition and the Ubuntu one but since the stuck partition won't remove I can't merge them. Any solutions?   <comment368039> Please search before posting - https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF
