Diskutil can't find Core Storage Volumes <body> My OSX Mountain Lion will no longer atart up. After the logon screen it spins forever (the Apple logon is replaced by an error sign).  When I run in single user mode I get a "still waiting for root device" that repeats every few seconds.  I suspect the problem is with core storage. Although I have encrypted the osx partition, the system can't find it (from recovery):  precodediskutil corestorage list No corestorage logical volume groups found.  /code/pre  fsck_cs will however report a corestorage:   precode** Checking volume.

Or at least mount it to get at a few files?  <answer70361> I was finally able to fix the problem:  ul liboot into recovery/li liunmount all volumes (otherwise gpt will complain that the resource is busy)/li liuse gpt to remove the partition (it had the HFS instead of the CoreStorage type)/li lialso delete the partition from the MBR with fdisk (otherwise gpt will not allow you to add the partition)./li lifinally use gpt to add the partition with the same values but as core storage (type 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC)/li /ul  Afterwards codediskutil cs list/code showed the volumes again - disk utility repair did the rest. No data lost :)  <comment174542> Can you elaborate on how this worked? I have an image of a CoreStorage partition that I can't figure out how to recover. It was created using dd from a hard drive that was about to fail. The dd was run on the physical volume that underpinned the CoreStorage volume. <comment174554> sorry, that was 2 years ago and about the only time I used that method. take a look at `man gpt` and `man fdisk`.
