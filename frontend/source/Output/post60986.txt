Time Tracking App with Alfred integration <body> Is there a time tracking that integrates with Alfred, so you can start/stop time tracking using typed commands?   <answer60990> I use Harvest to track time. It has a robust API. There is a command-line tool called hcl for interacting with Harvest time sheets.  I haven't bought the Alfred Powerpack myself, but I presume that since the Powerpack includes an interface to develop your own shell scripts to extend Alfred that it would be fairly straightforward to start/stop new tasks:  precode$ hcl start mytaskalias adding a new feature  $ hcl stop /code/pre  You've inspired me to look into this for improving my workflow. I currently use the Harvest application which has a very handy menu bar control, but being able to start/stop a timer quickly from Alfred sounds like a nice option…  <answer62958> I’m not really sure if there’s a time tracking software that integrates with AlfredApp but take a look at this project management app that has an integration with some useful Google applications, this might help you find a good alternative. In addition, most time trackers have an easy option to simply start/stop the timer. If you can find a software that requires you to simply enter a task name then that’s a good option to pick.   <answer103290> I just released a workflow with this functionality.  ul liView details on the Alfred forum: http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/3166-harvest-time-tracking//li liOr view the project directly on Github: https://github.com/tinystride/alfred-harvest/li /ul
