Is it possible to reference a cell in Numbers using two column headers? <body> I am aware that I can reference cells using the name of row/column headers.   It looks something like this: codeSheet Name::Table Name::Column Name Row Name/code.  However, I'm trying to reference something with emtwo/em column headers.  I'm hoping that I can reference something like codeJan 2017::Balance:Salary/code (pictured below).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChoAM.png" alt="Screenshot of multiple headers."  Is something like this even possible?
