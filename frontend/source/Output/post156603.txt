What Icon Display Resolutions and Pixel Densities Should I Use? <body> I am designing an icon for use with an Xcode template and need to know what display-resolution and pixel-density settings I need to use for each of the PNG files I'm exporting from GIMP into my code.iconset/code folder.  Specifically, what display resolutions and pixel densities should I use for the codeicon_512x512@2x.png/code, codeicon_512x512.png/code, codeicon_256x256@2x.png/code, codeicon_256x256.png/code, codeicon_128x128@2x.png/code, codeicon_128x128.png/code, codeicon_64x64@2x.png/code, codeicon_64x64.png/code, codeicon_32x32@2x/code, codeicon_32x32.png/code, codeicon_16x16@2x.png/code, and codeicon_16x16.png/code images in my icon set?    <answer156606> Use the resolution given in the name of the image. For @2x images, double the resolution in both directions. PPI does not matterâ€”Apple uses 72 PPI. Do not use any transparency or interlacing.  For example: codeicon_512x512@2x.png/code is a 1024x1024 image.  <comment184280> OK, thanks!  I thought that the resolution given in the name that you're supposed to use for each of your icon resources might be significant, but I wasn't sure if the `@2x` part meant double the resolution or double the pixel density.
