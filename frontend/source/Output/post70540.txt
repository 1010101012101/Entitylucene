White on black in TextEdit <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Default background color in Textedit       Is there any way to get text displayed in white and the background be black in TextEdit in plain text mode?  <answer70542> ol likbdCMD/kbd + kbd T/kbd/li liAdjust document color./li liAdjust text color./li /ol  <comment81867> Cool, any way to set that as default? I tried going through the preferences but the font picker seems broken (i.e. the colors don't update or anything, and when I reopen TextEdit it's black on white again). <comment81869> Hi, the color picker works for me. But I don't seem to be able to make it default. <comment81874> Yea, I meant it works (even though the color picker doesn't show any visual feedback, the actual window color changes), but setting it as default doesn't. <comment81885> You could save a blank document with those colours, then mark it as stationary pad (use Get Info in Finder), and start every new document from this one. <comment81887> Nice trick. Never know we can do that. <comment151431> Not a real solution as the cursor will still be black, rendering the editor nearly unusable.  And the cursor color can NOT be changed. If you wanted a computer that you can customize to your personality, you should have bought a Windoze or Linux machine.
