Unistall Realtek USB Ethernet Network Adapter <body> I would like to uninstall the "Realtek USB Ethernet Network Adapter" I can find it under System Information - Software - Installations in a list but don't know how to get rid of it.  <answer251637> Check the Realtek site for the latest driver of your USB Ethernet adapter and download it. The driver zip file should contain an uninstall.zip. Unzip this also and double-click the resulting emuninstall.command/em file. Enter the admin (root) password and reboot your Mac.  Provided it's a RTL8153 chip you can also pour the following content into a uninstall.command file and execute it:  precode#!/bin/sh . /etc/rc.common  echo "                                                                  " echo "Please type the password of \"root\" to Uninstall ..." FROM=`dirname "$0"`  echo "Removing Apple USB Ethernet Driver..."  sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleRTL815X*.kext sudo kextunload /Library/Extensions/AppleRTL815X*.kext  sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleRTL815X*.kext sudo rm -rf /Library/Extensions/AppleRTL815X*.kext  sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions/ sudo touch /Library/Extensions/  echo "Uninstall Complete." /code/pre  Depending on your system version you may have to disable SIP.  <comment344641> FYI, [Wikipedia page about the RealTek company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realtek).
