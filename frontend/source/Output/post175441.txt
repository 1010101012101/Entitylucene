Determine when an application last launched <body> I need to have a script return a date that a particular application launched (in this case Parallels, but solution should be non-specific) so that our asset management system can mark the license for re-use.  So far I've tried using the Spotlight metadata tag kMDItemLastUsedDate with  precodemdls /Applications/Parallels\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/prl_client_app \     -name kMDItemLastUsedDate /code/pre  but this does not always return dates that match the last time an app was used.  Any other ideas?
