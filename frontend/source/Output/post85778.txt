How can I omit FCPX Render Files from a Time Machine backup? <body> I want to be able to add my Final Cut Projects and Events folders to Time Machine, but annoyingly Apple have decided to put a Render Files folder within each and every Events folder.  Is there a way of moving the folders to a different location on the hard drive, such as a Caches folder? Or is there some way of telling Time Machine to ignore folders containing the words "Render Files" (using some kind of script perhaps)?  <answer224742> I have realised today, that OS X seems to automatically omit Render Files in the Time Machine Backup.  Apparently, Time Machine intentionally doesn't backup certain files/folder.  The file code/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.pl‌​ist/code includes all absolute paths (globally and for each user) that TimeMachine ignores, as suggested by this article. File-patterns, are, however, not included in this file.  h2Note/h2  I have examined this behaviour by comparing the two directories after a completed backup:  precodediff --brief -r timemachinefolder localfolder /code/pre  <comment272583> The list suggests these exclusions are from CCC and not Time Machine. In your research, did you find anything from Apple about this behaviour? <comment272713> Correct, and that bugged me as well. I could reproduce the behaviour on my local machine, but I would love to see official documentation on this. Will change my wording regarding the link. <comment272721> An [article on shiftedbits](http://shiftedbits.org/2007/10/31/time-machine-exclusions/) reveals the following file `/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist`. This file contains all that Time Machine skips by default on OS X! <comment272723> That helps a lot, but it only includes absolute paths (for globally and for each user), not specific folder patterns, for instance. PS: I have just realised my fail that the article didn't even relate to TimeMachine. My bad, and thanks for the correction!
