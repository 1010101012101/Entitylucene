Can't update MacPorts after upgrading to Mavericks <body> I ran codeport selfupdate/code and MacPorts tried to upgrade itself to version 2.2.1, but eventually fails. When I add the code-v/code flag, I can see the build fails after these lines:  precodechecking for Tcl configuration... configure: error: Can't find Tcl configuration definitions Command failed: cd     /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/tarballs/base &amp;&amp; CC=/usr/bin/cc OBJC=/usr/bin/cc ./configure --prefix=/opt/local --with-tclpackage=/Library/Tcl --with-install-user=root --with-install-group=admin --with-directory-mode=0755 --enable-readline &amp;&amp; make SELFUPDATING=1 &amp;&amp; make install SELFUPDATING=1 Exit code: 1 /code/pre  How can I get MacPorts back?  <answer107505> You need to update the command line tools Xcode installs. For whatever reason, Xcode doesn't seem to want to update them itself, but you can force it by running codexcode-select --install/code. This will pop open a GUI prompt; select "Install" and let the installer do its thing. After this, MacPorts should build itself successfully. (You may need to rehash first; coderehash/code in tcsh, codehash -r/code in bash and zsh (I think).)  <answer107540> I installed the ActiveTCL distribution from Active State. I vaguely recalled it was necessary; I just bought a new machine, has Mavericks, and I put the ActiveState TCL distro on it as a matter of habit prior to rebuilding my MacPorts install.  <comment126230> So it had Mavericks out-of-the-box, right? You didn't need to upgrade? I'd imagine the circumstances are a bit different, from the problem I was having, then. <comment127077> Installing ActiveTCL is certainly not necessary for MacPorts. It might not even be a suitable Tcl, because MacPorts currently does not work with MacPorts.
