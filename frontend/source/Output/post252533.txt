Installing Windows 7 without DVD/Flash Drive - stuck at step 5 <body> I was following this amazing guide on how to install Windows 7 without Bootcamp and got stuck at step 5. It should create files, but it didn't. I got the following result in Terminal:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aeIRM.png" alt="enter image description here"   After doing what David told me to do, I noticed it created the partition on 'disk0s5', or at least it has this as its identifier.   precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE           IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB         disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB       disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS HDD                     749.7 GB       disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB       disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                249.5 GB       disk0s5 /dev/disk1 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE           IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        +2.0 GB         disk1    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 BCSS                    2.0 GB         disk1s1 /code/pre  Is it alright to just switch things around and replace every Terminal command containing 'disk0s4' with 'disk0s5', so it locates the right partition?  Thanks in advance. :)  <answer252806> Usually the OS X operating system is synchronized with the values stored in the GUID Partition Table (GPT). In other words, partition 4 in the table for codedisk0/code would be be identified as code/dev/disk0s4/code. In your case, the identifier is code/dev/disk0s5/code. The easiest way to resynchronize is to restart the Mac.  <comment314288> The instructions you are refer to install Windows on partition 4 of disk 0. In your case, you do not have a fourth partition on disk 0. This was suppose to be created in step 1. I suggest you run the Terminal application commands `diskutil list`, `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` and post the output to your question. Also, what is the model/year of your Mac. <comment314341> I used Disk Utility to create a partition, just like the guide told me. I will update my post, as there is something strange going on - it created a partition on disk 5. <comment314342> Restart the Mac and see if the Identifiers change. <comment314381> This seems to have done the trick. Thank you. <comment314558> @HaloLamp Please don't post text output in your shell as screenshot!
