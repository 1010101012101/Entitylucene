Need Guidance in Installing Mobile partner application for 3g/4g dongle in macbook air <body> Recently I bought a MacBook Air and it's my first Apple product. I tried installing mobile partner application for Huawei mobile broadband E351i-1, but mobile partner doesn't show any network or huawei device connected to system. To resolve this issue I googled and found Huawei driver then installed; it still no luck.
