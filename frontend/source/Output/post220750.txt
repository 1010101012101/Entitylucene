How to disable the Guest account on OS X El Capitan <body> About a couple of weeks ago, the Guest user account was automatically enabled on my Mac running OS X El Capitan (by itself, without me enabling it). Now, whenever I start my Mac, I am greeted with a login screen showing two accounts: 1) Mine. 2) Guest user.  I have Find My Mac turned off, as I know people have suggested that the Find My Mac feature may be responsible for this behavior. Beyond that, I have logged out of my iCloud account from "System Preferences - iCloud," and also disabled the Guest account from "System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups." Now it shows the Guest user as off in System Preferences.   However, when I start my Mac, I'm still shown two accounts to log-in. And yes, I have tried and have successfully managed to log into the Guest account despite having disabled it in System Preferences.  This is very strange, and I was wondering if anyone has found a fix.   Additional Info which may help: I've never had this issue with any other versions of OS X prior to El Capitan. And I've got FileVault enabled, and it's been enabled since OS X Lion without this issue.  I'd greatly appreciate any feedback.  <answer224551> Seems like a duplicate of another question, this answer should help you: Guest login got enabled even though FileVault 2 is enabled and Guest login is disabled  <answer231883> After some extensive testing (and multiple Time Machine restores--to verify that this fix works), I have found a solution. And it's pretty easy too, just don't do it on the go, or you'll wipe out your battery.  ol liVisit Apple's dedicated website to download the OS X 10.11.4 Combo Update/li liDisable Find My Mac/li listrongEnsure that you have disabled the guest user/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EdNOt.png" alt="Disable Guest User"/li liInstall the combo update/li /ol  Poof!

It works nicely with FileVault 2, Bootcamp, and Time Machine, so no worries there.  <comment267234> Did you turn off find my mac before logging out? Did you disable the guest both in its account as well as general login settings? <comment267327> I turned of Find My Mac before I logged out. I also disabled the Guest account in System Preferences as an administrative user. Still haven't solved the problem. Do you have a solution? <comment267328> Do you have FileVault on? <comment272186> This happened to me before, with Mavericks. I wipe my computer every 4-5 months are so though, so it is no longer an issue. It was infuriating though. <comment283899> You don't actually need to install the combo update... Since you've File Vault enabled your login happens pre-boot on the EFI... disabling the Guest User won't update the EFI login screen. I found a way to force it to update, read this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/232352/36313 . It should fix the issue.
