iTunes makes me log in every time I try to synch my phone <body> so I bought an iPhone 7 Plus and I've been having problems every time I try to sync it with iTunes. Basically it says the pc does not have permission to use the apps installed in it, and I have to either put my password or just cancel. I feel like maybe it has something to do with the fact that I created a new Apple ID but I use the old Game Center account, which is linked to my old Apple ID. But I logged out and the same thing happens. I also deleted two games I though might have been interfering but no luck. What else can I do? I tried everything and asked everywhere.
