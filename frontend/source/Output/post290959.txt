System size is 8 GB after Clean Install of Sierra <body> After I did a clean install of Sierra it first showed as 14 GB in size in "About My Mac Storage". After some few weeks it shows as 8 GB in size.   Why does happen like this and how do I fix it?  <comment367311> There is a problem and it is not showing the whole question.Please click 'improve this question'.Then see the whole question <comment367312> I removed the less-than symbol from the body text to make your question complete.  As for your question, perhaps some behind-the-scenes macOS activity deleted hidden cache files, swap files, and other temporary files. <comment367314> Yeah it could be because I was downloading many apps. <comment367315> Before you can 'fix' it - how do you know one of those figures is 'broken' & which one? <comment367316> I don't understand what you are asking. <comment367318> What do you mean with *System* size? The *System* size in "About My Mac  Storage  Manage  Recommendations - System" defaults to ~ 8.0-8.7 GB. The folder /System has a default size of ~ 5.5 GB and the whole system install ~ 10.5 GB (after some use but without sleepimage and swap). <comment367322> Oh I did not know that but thanks anyways for your comment @klanomath.And my system folder is 7.91GB after 1 min of boot.
