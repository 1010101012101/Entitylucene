How can you change the mouse cursor in OSX? <body> I can't find many solutions for changing the mouse cursor on OSX 10.6  I've seen http://unsanity.com/haxies/mightymouse but it does not support 10.6 at the moment.  Any hints or tricks to change the cursor? Specifically, I need to modify the text selection cursor as it is almost invisible when using a grey background in my IDE.  Thanks!  <answer6231> Sorry, Apple doesn't allow people to change the mouse cursor anymore.   <answer6235> You could use Mouse Locator and leave it on or turn it on via a hotkey when you need to find your cursor.  <answer6272> There are a couple options:  In System Preferences  Universal Access  Mouse pane, there is a control to change the size of the cursor.  Mousepos√© is an application that supports Snow Leopard used mostly for presentations and recording demos. You can set up a hotkey that dims the screen puts a spotlight on the current cursor position so you can find it quickly.  <answer139238> Mousecape does a great job. It is almost completely undocumented, sub-1.0 release, and doesn't really come with any cursors. Still worth a look!  <answer157608> Use Mousecape. I'm currently using version 0.0.5.  ol liDownload the program (version 0.0.5)/li liDouble-click the program/li liMake a new mouse cape (cmd + n or by menus)/li liDrag image files on to each new pointer, choose what type of pointer/li liMove the Hot Spot to correctly register clicks/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uF2Pm.png" alt="enter image description here"  I suggest getting images from free icon libraries. Google search or something. I downloaded some free icons and edited them.  You can use custom capes that others have made but the only one I've found is the one included in the source code. To get it, download the source and find the .cape file in it. Simple drag and drop the file into the program.  You can download the source code, etc, on github.  <comment6527> Thanks for the info. I've filed a bug at https://bugreport.apple.com .  I suggest everyone else with this problem do so too :) <comment6528> can you provide or some reference regarding this?  thanks in advance <comment6531> Well, strictly speaking, it's less "allow" and more "changed the implementation and nobody's figured out how to hack it yet". <comment34461> I just field a bug for this. This is annoying. <comment241930> i just tried it, and this works great on 10.10 <comment255736> On 10.10.5 Yosemite, it's System Preferences  Acccessibility  Mouse & Trackpad, but there's no longer a control to change the cursor size.
