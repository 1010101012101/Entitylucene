Family sharing notifications <body> I am in a family with other people, but I am not the family organiser. I know that whenever I make a purchase from iTunes or the AppStore, the family organiser gets sent the invoice, but are they also notified about free downloads I make, such as apps?  <answer199231> No, only purchases that are not Tier 0 (Free) will cause an email to be sent.
