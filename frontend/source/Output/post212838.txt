Can MacOSX 10.7 open tar.lzma files <body> Can the codetar/code command included by default on MacOSX 10.7 open tar.lzma (or tar.xz) archives?  If it helps to answer I have a sample file here.  You could test by opening a Terminal and issuing:  code curl -O http://www.panix.com/~ruari/test.tar.lzma tar xOf test.tar.lzma /code  If you don't want to try that file. You emmight/em be able to generate a similar sample archive with these commands but since I do not have MacOSX 10.7 I do not know for sure.  code echo 'It works!' &gt; README.txt tar --lzma -cf test.tar.lzma README.txt /code  <comment256997> I would be very careful with just downloading some anonymous file from an anonymous source, so let's find out what the issue is here first and what you have/could try to solve the problem: Why can't you test this yourself? What kind of software is used to generate .xz files in the first place? Is the tool generating .xz files even available for OSX? <comment256999> I have no access to a 10.7 machine, otherwise I would simply check myself.  I generated the sample file on a NetBSD machine with the included `tar` command and the `lzma`. It contains a README.txt text file that says simply, "It works!". <comment257000> Versions of MacOSX 10.9 and above are able to generate xz compressed tar archives with the `--xz` switch on creation or lzma compressed tar archives with `--lzma`. I know this as I do have access to a 10.10 machine. In addition https://www.aeyoun.com/technote/archive-utility-xz.html <comment257004> Ok, I received an answer from a friend on twitter (where I also asked). It seems that although the libarchive version (on which bsdtar is based) is new enough that it should support lzma/xz, Apple did not compile in support for these formats until 10.9
