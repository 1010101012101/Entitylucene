can I trash my mail folder <body> My mail folder is using a lot of memory.  Can I simply empty the folder in the Application Support folder or do I have to throw mail in the trash using the Mail program?  <answer154928> This article should help you manage your mail storage, deletion, and batch deletion issues: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11732. Advanced: Be wary that erasing mail on a client for IMAP can erase the server copy too.  <answer154957> As a general rule: strongdon't delete anything in code~/Library/code/strong. Those are private folders used by apps to save configuration and data.   The code~/Library/Application Support/Mail/code folder in particular holds configuration files.  Don't delete code~/Library/Mail/code either, if your mail provider uses POP3 you'll loose all mail, if your mail provider uses IMAP the Mail app will download it again.  To free up disk space delete mails you no longer need and then simply empty the trash:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x8Han.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment182330> Answers can contain links, but should stand on their own in case the link breaks.
