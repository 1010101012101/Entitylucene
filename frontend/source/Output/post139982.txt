How can I take 120 fps video on iPhone 5s without slow-mo? <body> How can I take 120 fps videos by iPhone 5S without using slow motion feature ?  <answer139996> "Slow motion" is a application name for recording at 120 frames per second.  Recording at 120 fps requires that software feature enabled.  Playback speed is your choice, slow motion or not.  <answer150875> Shooting at "slow motion" is shooting 120 frames per second realtime. If you playback the resulting video at 120fps, you will see it in realtime. The "Slow motion" is a post-recording playback feature that slows the 120fps video down to 30fps. So recording "slow motion" is indeed giving you true 120fps video.  <answer253009> You can first take videos with the slow motion feature then edit the video.Just scroll the blue line towards the another blue line then it will be just a normal video and not a slow motion video.  <comment164955> Slow motion is the one that does the 120 frames per second. So why not using it if you want the 120 fps? <comment164956> because I just want 120 fps video that is not slow motion. <comment164957> I think we are confusing something. Recording at high speed and playing at lower speed creates the slow motion effect, while playback at same speed (120fps) plays at normal speed.
