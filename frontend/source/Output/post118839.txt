If so, can we find a plain english explanation of the modes?  <answer138671> I'm not completely certain of the FREEZER options, other than one FREEZER_COMPRESSOR option uses swap (utilizes free space on a disk) when RAM is low or expended, while the other does not.  What I think is that the FREEZER options are for managing memory for frozen processes. Maybe this is something experimental, to be used in combination with App Nap? I think this was something they were testing with iOS a few years back.  What I know is that option 1 uses no compression, and is the old fashioned OS X memory management we're all more familiar with. If you're having issues you suspect are related to memory compression, you might try this setting.  Option 2 uses compressed memory with no swap (no writing to disk when RAM is low or expended).   Option 4 uses both compression and swap.   Option 8 uses whatever the FREEZER is, backed by the option 1 implementation.  <comment152833> The header file you quote seems to state that both modes 2 and 4 means that the compressed pager is enabled. Therefore I'm a bit puzzled by your question - do you mean that you have actually tried mode 2, and it didn't enable compressed memory? <comment257940> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/175572/23761 <comment277593> Is there actual documentation on what the FREEZER does?
