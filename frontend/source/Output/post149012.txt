OSX 10.9.5 upgrade causes apache/php downgrade <body> Today I installed the OSX 10.9.5 upgrade and it appears to have downgraded my Apache and PHP version.  Is there an easy way to reverse this emunwanted/em downgrade? Or do I have to reinstall apache via homebrew again?  <answer149018> I replaced the following line in httpd.conf:  codeLoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so/code  With:  codeLoadModule php5_module /usr/local/Cellar/php55/5.5.12/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so/code  This seems to have restored a lot of my old setup and I can work again.  <comment175532> Please explain what you had done to Apache on your system before the upgrade. <comment175533> I had upgraded it to 2.4, upgraded php to 5.5, I had configured httpd.conf. That seems to be lost now. Looks like the upgrade simply blew away my old httpd.conf <comment175534> PHP is no longer loading in a bunch of extensions like memcached. <comment175535> I think if apache will use my homebrewed version of php that will probably sort things out for today. <comment175536> How did you upgrade? Did you replace the system files or install in a different path? <comment175538> I don't remember... it was a while ago. I didn't expect the fine folks at Apple to take such a brutal approach with my setup. <comment175539> It looks like I only had the one install. So I guess I must have replaced the install. <comment175540> `Henrys-MacBook-Pro:Sites $ locate httpd | grep httpd$ /Library/WebServer/share/httpd /usr/sbin/httpd /usr/share/httpd /usr/share/zsh/5.0.2/functions/_lighttpd Henrys-MacBook-Pro:Sites$  ` <comment175542> I guess the lesson here is to backup your apache config before you do an OSX upgrade.
