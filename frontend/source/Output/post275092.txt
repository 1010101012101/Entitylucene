How to Copy Current URL of Web Page in Fluid App with AppleScript/Service and Bind on Keyboard Shortcut? <body> I'm using FluidApp Version 1.8.6 (2331) on MacOS Sierra 10.12.3. Sometimes I need to copy current URL of Web page in FluidApp. I want to do it with keyboard shortcut and I know I need to use a service for it.  So how do I create a service for this job?  <answer275119> Developer of Fluid here. I don't know much about Services, but in Fluid you can copy the current URL using keyboard shortcuts, but it requires emtwo/em:  kbd⌘L/kbd - to temporarily show and select the text of the URL location text field at the top.  kbd⌘C/kbd - to copy the selected text.  kbdEsc/kbd - to dismiss the toolbar at the top.  <answer275160> If you're having issues using kbd⌘/kbdkbdL/kbd, kbd⌘/kbdkbdC/kbd and kbdEsc/kbd and you want an strongAppleScript/strong emscript/em that runs as an strongAutomator/strong emService/em, in order to copy the strongURL/strong of a strongFluid App/strong, created with strongFluid/strong, then here is an example scenario you could implement.  Under strongmacOS 10.12.3/strong using strongFluid/strong em(Version 1.8.6 (206))/em and the strongURL/strong emof this question/em, I created a strongFluid App/strong named strongAsk Different Question/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IFDlt.png" alt="Ask Different Question Fluid App"  I them made an strongAutomator/strong emService workflow/em using a strongRun AppleScript/strong emaction/em and the strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em below.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeset appName to "Ask Different Question"  tell application appName     activate     tell application "System Events"         set toolbarState to (name of every menu item of menu 1 of menu bar item 5 of menu bar 1 of application process appName)         if toolbarState contains "Show Toolbar" then             keystroke "t" using {option down, command down}             set the clipboard to (get value of text field 1 of group 1 of toolbar 1 of window 1 of application process appName)             keystroke "t" using {option down, command down}         else             set the clipboard to (get value of text field 1 of group 1 of toolbar 1 of window 1 of application process appName)         end if     end tell end tell /code/pre  ul liNote that all you should have to change in the emcode/em above is the first line, codeset appName to .../code where code.../code is the name of your strongFluid App/strong. The rest of the emcode/em should then work emas is/em./li /ul  In strongAutomator/strong, create a new emService workflow/em, adding a strongRun AppleScript/strong emaction/em to it. Then replace the emdefault code/em with the emcode/em above. Also change the emvalue/em for strongService receives/strong to strongno input/strong while selecting the target strongFluid App/strong for strongin/strong, as shown in the image below. Then save the strongAutomator/strong emService workflow/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyP5c.png" alt="Automator Image"  The next step is to assign a emkeyboard shortcut/em for the strongAutomator/strong emService workflow/em you've just created.  In strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong  strongServices/strong, find your emservice/em and set its emshortcut/em.  I used kbd⌘/kbdkbdU/kbd as that was easy to remember using strongU/strong for strongURL/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g12Qj.png" alt="Services Keyboard Shortcut Image"  The last thing you'll need to do, is add the strongFluid App/strong you created that will use the strongAutomator/strong emService workflow/em you've just created to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongPrivacy/strong  strongAccessibility/strong as shown in the image below for the strongAsk Different Question/strong app I created in strongFluid/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwpC8.png" alt="Security &amp; Privacy Image"  Now when you're in the strongFluid App/strong you created and press kbd⌘/kbdkbdU/kbd, the strongURL/strong will be copied to the strongClipboard/strong and from there you can empaste/em it wherever you'd like.  <comment346045> Its quite good tip but when I press CMD+L +, CMD+C and then ESC key, the address bar remains open. So, then I have to close it.  For this reason I want to copy the address with a single key. <comment346171> It's working. Thank you for your reply.  <comment346614> Hi, again. It's working in the Automator. But it doesn't work with app itself and I met with an error alert (its says: "The action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error.".   By the way I created a screencast for this issue. You can watch it from here: https://cl.ly/jSe8  How can solve this issue? <comment346621> @fatihturan, I made a Fluid App for Trillo and it works as my answer is written.  My first test I had a typo but then corrected it and it works in Script Editor, Automator and from the Trillo Fluid App. Test running the code in Script Editor and see that it works there too. I'll look at it again this evening, but I have things to do this afternoon. <comment346622> Could it be a relationship if I do the same for another Fluid app? I've tried to apply other two Fluid app too... What do you think about this? <comment346694> @fatihturan, There is definitely a conflict if you have more then one Fluid App as the primary executable inside each Fluid App application bundle is `/Contents/MacOS/FluidApp`. You might need to talk to the Developer about this. <comment346743> Hi Todd, can you checkout [above reply](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/275160/1556) and [comment](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/275092/how-to-copy-current-url-of-web-page-in-fluid-app-with-applescript-service-and-bi/275160?noredirect=1#comment346694_275160)? <comment346767> @fatihturan, I could reproduce the error when having two Fluid App apps, one having a keyboard shortcut and the other just the service and no shortcut much less if they both had shortcuts. I'd have to uncheck/check the non-working one in Accessibility to get it to work again, which disabled the previous working one. So it seams only one can have the service much less a shortcut. This reminds me of my programming days in Windows when I'd subclass a process under another process and it looks like something like that is going on here, although it been far to many years for me to delve into that. <comment346768> @fatihturan, Sadly, as written, it looks like my answer is only good for one Fluid App. :( <comment346805> Thank you very much despite everything. :)
