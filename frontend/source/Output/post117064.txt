How to launch browser in iOS Simulator from command line? <body> I want to launch the browser in iOS Simulator from the Terminal with specified URL.  Is there any command for it? So that I can write in a script which will take URL as argument and launch simulator with browser and URL open on it.  <answer117066>    code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone\ Simulator.app/Contents/MacOS/iPhone\ Simulator -SimulateApplication /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator7.0.sdk/Applications/MobileSafari.app/MobileSafari -u "http://google.com/"/code   supYes this really is one long command â€” make sure to run it all. Replace codegoogle.com/code with actual website, and codeiPhoneSimulator7.0.sdk/code with the relevant version of the simulator that you're using./sup  <answer117074> Another way to do it is to use a temp file that redirects to the URL you want, then opening this file in the simulator.  This isn't necessarily the best way, but it is a shorter command.  codeecho "&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content='0;url=http://apple.stackexchange.com'&gt;"  ~/tmp/openURL.html; open ~/tmp/openURL.html -a /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone\ Simulator.app//code  As in the other answers, you can replace the URL (I put apple.stackexchange.com) with whatever you want. Just make sure you put http:// because codeopen/code interprets arguments as filesystem paths by default.  Sadly, the bulk of the command is just the path to the iPhone Simulator bundle.  <answer117092> Here's what to do : Go to Finder and run code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal/code, and paste in the following code:  precodeopen /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone\ Simulator.app /code/pre  That should help if you use XCODE, or a iOS Simulator.  <answer135916> precodeosascript -e "tell application \"iPhone Simulator\" to activate" /code/pre  <answer148025> The path has changed for Xcode 6.0 (OS X Yosemite) and now it's:  codealias simulator='open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/iOS\ Simulator.app'/code  <answer198798> On Xcode6 simctl was introduced so you can just open the terminal and type:  codexcrun simctl openurl booted "https://google.com"/code   <comment136862> This doesn't open to the browser, let alone a specified URL. <comment149651> You can easily pass in the target website if you replace `"http://google.com"` with `"$*"`, and you save this as a shell script (e.g. `~/launch_ios_browser.sh`, then `chmod 700` the file). Then you can go to localhost using `~/launch_ios_browser.sh http://apple.com` <comment161139> This does start the Simulator, but how does it start the browser inside the simulator as well? <comment173457> @grgarside Any idea how to do this in the latest Xcode with the iOS Simulator?
