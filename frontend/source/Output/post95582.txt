Meaning of "./" in Mac terminal <body> I am a new user of the Mac terminal.  What is the meaning of "./"?  What is the difference between the commands  precoderm image.png rm ./image.png rm *./image.png /code/pre  <answer95584> code.//code is part of the path to a directory/file.  If used as part of a parameter to a command  ul licoderm image.png/code and coderm ./image.png/code are exactly the same and identify a file in the current directory/li licoderm *./image.png/code is a pattern which looks for files named codeimage.png/code in all subdirectories of the current directory which end with a dot/li /ul  The key use for code.//code usually is to call a script/executable in the current directory. When you execute a command without specifiying it's directory (e.g. codecp/code instead of code/bin/cp/code), the shell searches for this in all directories listed in the code$PATH/code variable. The current directory is usually not part of that variable (for security reasons) so you can use code./command-name/code to tell the shell to look for the command in the current directory.  <answer288348> The expression in a file path, (./) means 'move up' (from the current location), i.e., 'this' = '.' and / = 'up'   so  ../ means 'move up 2 directories', or, move to the parent of this (./), i.e., take the current location and move up to '/' the new location.  <comment112138> You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately. <comment112146> +1 - In addition if one types `ls -a`, they will see entries for `.` and `..`. One probably already knows that `..` is the parent directory, so naturally `.` is the current directory. However, such things have no special meaning if used in the middle of the string rather than from the start, so `rm *./image.png` is the red herring in this question (It's just a glob matching things such as `directorywithadot./image.png`.) <comment112147> In response to the second (removed) question, [SymbolHound](http://www.symbolhound.com/) is a search engine that doesn't ignore special characters. Also, the OS X Terminal is a Unix-like environment, meaning you can often find answers using search terms such as "[dot slash linux](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dot+slash+linux)".
