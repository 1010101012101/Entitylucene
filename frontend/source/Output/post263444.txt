Touch ID Unavailable After Sleep MacBook Pro <body> I am using a 2016 MacBook Pro 15" (Model A1707). Whenever I put my computer on sleep, then wake it up, I find that I cannot use Touch ID to unlock my computer. The screenshot below shows the screen when I wake up the computer. How can I enable Touch ID after my computer is asleep? Thanks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2naay.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer263495> I messed with the sleep/screen saver settings and restarted and it seemed to have fixed my issue.   <answer265253> The bug was fixed in macOS 10.12.2  <comment330126> Could you please specify which settings you changed? <comment358869> That does not seem to be the case.   I am on 10.12.4 and the touchId is still disabled after sleep mode. <comment364660> Agreed, 10.12.5 and it's still an issue.
