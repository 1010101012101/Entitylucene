How to use CapsLock as modifier key without consuming Alt+Shift keybinding? <body> I want to use kbdCapsLock/kbd as a modifier key to type symbols like code({\})=/code using the alphabetical keys in the keyboard.   For example:  precodeCapsLock+a is mapped to = CapsLock+k is mapped to \ /code/pre  To do this, I mapped kbdCapsLock/kbd to kbdOption/kbd+kbdShift/kbd using Keyremap4Macbook following the instructions in "A Useful Capslock Key".  precode&lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;F19 to F19&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;appendix&gt;(F19 (capslock) to (shift+opt))&lt;/appendix&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.f192f19_escape&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;not&gt;VIRTUALMACHINE&lt;/not&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;         --KeyOverlaidModifier--         KeyCode::F19,         KeyCode::OPTION_L,         ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L,     &lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  Note that, before that I mapped kbdCapsLock/kbd to key code 80 in PcKeyboardHack which is key code of F19.   Then I mapped key combinations of codeCapsLock + alphabetical characters/code to symbols such as code=\})(/code using Ukelele.  So far, everything works properly except that there is a side effect of this setup: I cannot use kbdAlt/kbd+kbdShift/kbd modifier for any other key binding. This is pretty restrictive compromise.   I tried mapping kbdCapsLock/kbd to more complex key bindings such as kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd or kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd or kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd. But these didn't work well because then mapping kbdCapsLock/kbd+codealphabetical keys/code in Ukelele changes the alphabetical keys too. For example, assume that kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbda/kbd is mapped to code=/code. Then kbda/kbd alone is mapped to code=/code as well.   I wonder if this problem can be solved somehow? I think there might be two alternative paths to look for solution:  ol liCreating a new custom modifier key for kbdCapsLock/kbd without consuming existing modifier keys such as kbdAlt/kbd+kbdShift/kbd./li liPreventing the mapping of kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbda/kbd to change the kbda/kbd key all together./li /ol  Are these solutions possible to implement?  <comment154790> I just realized I never hit caps lock by purpose... <comment154995> Most people don't use caps lock neither. But the location of caps lock is much easier to access than any other modifier key. Using home row keys together with caps lock in order to type symbols is a very big productivity gain.
