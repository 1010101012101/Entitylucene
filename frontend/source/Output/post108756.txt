How to send the entire iMessage conversation to a friend? App to take a screenshot of the whole conversation? <body> Is there an app for that? I want to send the entire iMessage conversation to a friend, organized, so he can understand the conversation. Not just the text in there. Is there a way to do that?  <answer108791> There is likely a log of all your chat history in Library-Messages. If you open the .ichat file in iMessage then it will come up in the standard chat format.  <answer123260> If you copy and paste from Messages, it is organized by who typed each message.   <comment148549> What OS are you running iMessage? OS X or iOS?
