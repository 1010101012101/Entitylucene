How to force a readonly volume to remount as read-write? <body> I have an external Firewire volume with some filesystem problems. One problem is that Disk Warrior can't fix these errors because there is not enough space left on this volume (in fact, it is completely full - 0 bytes empty, which I suspect is the reason for the FS-problems). Another problem is that this disk gets mounted readonly by the OS, hence I can't delete any files on it to make it possible for Disk Warrior (or fsck) to fix the file system. I have tried the commands in this question but they only generate an error message:  precode% mount -u -w /Volumes/MyVol  mount_hfs: error on mount(): error = -1. mount_hfs: Invalid argument /code/pre  I also tried codemount_hfs/code with different options, but something like this  precode% mount_hfs -o update /dev/disk3s3 /Volumes/MyVol mount_hfs: error on mount(): error = -1. mount_hfs: Invalid argument /code/pre  strongHow do I force mount this volume in readwrite mode so I can try to delete some of the files on it?/strong  And you don't have to tell me to backup and erase the volume.  Update: I just found the codehfs.util/code command and run it like this  precode/System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs/Contents/Resources/hfs.util -M disk3s3 /Volumes/test writable /code/pre  but it just responds with is "usage" page. On this usage page there is an example that looks like this:  precode/System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs/Contents/Resources/hfs.util -p disk0s2 fixed writable /code/pre  Can't see any difference between that and my command..?  <answer221827> I managed to delete some files to free up space on the device by connecting it to my NAS, where it was mounted as writable. Doesn't really answer my question, however it solved my problem. Now I am gonna try to fix the file system.  <comment268969> I'm having a pretty similar problem... can you describe the steps in your solution? <comment269001> I just connected the drive to my NAS which allowed it to be mounted writable. I then used the NAS file browser UI to delete some files off it. <comment269356> I looked up NAS and it sounded like you had some sort of machine that let you attach drives to it and then see them as network devices, so in other words, not something I could do. Thanks for responding.
