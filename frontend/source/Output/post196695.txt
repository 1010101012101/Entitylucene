Dialog I cannot get rid of <body> The steps here were simple, but unexpected:  ol lidownload a file/li liin finder, rename the file using Keyboard:  ol liPress codeEnter/code to start rename/li liStart typing a new name (but not pressing codeEnter/code again)/li /ol/li liTry to open the file by pressing codeCommand/code-codeO/code/li /ol  Now this dialog appears and won't go away (it only reacts on moving with the mouse, but clicking on it fails, just as pressing codeSpacebar/code, codeEnter/code or codeEsc/code).  Both Finder and Spotlight now refuse to open any other file.  I tried:  precodekillall -KILL Dock killall -KILL Finder killall -KILL NotificationCenter killall -KILL SystemUIServer /code/pre  Help (:  Note the file is not damaged, just renamed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UpPuv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer196719> The icon in the dialog box is the clue. It's something to do with Gatekeeper. This article from Apple https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202491 might help.  <answer196755> Search for OS X identify process by window I found What process owns a certain window (Mac OS X) which told me this after moving the Window:  precodeRetinaMBPro1TB:bin jeroenp$ ./show-recently-moved-windows.py  Move target window  List of windows that moved: {(         {         kCGWindowAlpha = 1;         kCGWindowBounds =         {             Height = 1094;             Width = 1130;             X = 43;             Y = 45;         };         kCGWindowIsOnscreen = 1;         kCGWindowLayer = 0;         kCGWindowMemoryUsage = 5246548;         kCGWindowName = "bin \U2014 Python \U2014 160\U00d776";         kCGWindowNumber = 23921;         kCGWindowOwnerName = Terminal;         kCGWindowOwnerPID = 357;         kCGWindowSharingState = 1;         kCGWindowStoreType = 2;     },         {         kCGWindowAlpha = 1;         kCGWindowBounds =         {             Height = 153;             Width = 420;             X = 1359;             Y = 182;         };         kCGWindowIsOnscreen = 1;         kCGWindowLayer = 8;         kCGWindowMemoryUsage = 390292;         kCGWindowName = "";         kCGWindowNumber = 23246;         kCGWindowOwnerName = CoreServicesUIAgent;         kCGWindowOwnerPID = 87976;         kCGWindowSharingState = 1;         kCGWindowStoreType = 2;     } )} /code/pre  Since codeCoreServicesUIAgent/code is the owner, I performed this:  precodekillall -KILL CoreServicesUIAgent /code/pre  That worked. Now I can open the PDF again.  <comment235027> unless the file is confidential, could you provide the source for it so I can test. <comment235044> what happens if you do press enter after tying the new name ? <comment235105> @Buscarì›ƒSD The file is in a DropBox folder. It synced to another machine where I verified the file is indeed valid, even after the rename synced as well. I didn't even have to press Enter to finish the rename: the switching away from Finder did that for me. <comment235106> The icons look the same, but it looks gatekeeper is about applications (.PDF open in the stock Preview applications which is from Apple). My settings are pretty default: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nmbc6004h0s5n7m/Screenshot%202015-07-21%2006.21.39.png?dl=0 <comment235107> Thanks for clarifying. So you are renaming a file that is in the Dropbox folder. What happens if you move it out of it, just to see if it has anything to do with the sync link. <comment235115> Didn't help. The dialog was blocking for any PDF to open in finder. Probably a bug somewhere. Killing the process under it solves the issue.
