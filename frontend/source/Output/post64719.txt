OS X Contacts (Mountain Lion) with CardDav - "CoreDAVHTTPStatusErrorDomain error 500" <body> I've recently setup a CardDav account with a hosted Atmail Cloud account. It works perfectly on iOS, and seems to pull in some of the contacts, however every time Contacts re-syncs I am getting the following error:  precode    9/20/12 5:19:24.622 PM Contacts[785]: [CardDAVPlugin-ERROR] -_handleCompletedAction: Error Domain=CoreDAVHTTPStatusErrorDomain Code=500 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.

Anyone run into this issue before?  <answer66703> The response says the the error is when communicating with the 3rd party server (since the Mac isn't CentOS obviously) and that there was an error on the server side (type 500)  The 5xx range of HTTP response codes are for server side errors, basically there was an error, we couldn't do anything and we are closing the connection.  <comment90061> Effectively I used a Zimbra server connection since years and the address sync worked fine until we upgraded 2 Macs to recent apple version 10.8.2. For the others ones we stopped upgrading until issue would be solved. Our iphones 4, 4S continued working fine without apple cloud, but now a new iphone 5 shows same problems. I consider it is a voluntary change in operations system pushing third party server services services out off the game to push the cloud foreword. But such measure does not increase user confidence. Apple, remember your strenths and remind yourself why microsoft lost market p <comment95015> Think it's about server too. Maybe about configuration.
