Files encrypted in a folder - how to reverse it? <body> I've been playing with a computer game (Kerbal Space Program, OS X 10.9.3) and recently found that I can no longer load saved games (missions). I contacted the tech support and all they could say is that the folder containing the saved game files is encrypted. What is more,  I can create a new game but once I quit, I can no longer load it. It seems that something keeps encrypting the files in that particular folder. Why is this happening and what can I do about it? How can I reverse the encryption?  <answer132515> It may be due to ACLs. You can clear the ACLs on the folder recursively with:  precodechmod -R -N /path/to/folder /code/pre  <comment156903> Which OSX version are you running? Do you have any utilities installed which do directory encryption? <comment156904> Scusi, OS X 10.9.3. I don't remember installing such utilities. <comment156905> OSX has no built in folder encryption. Are you storing the save files in DMG or on an external drive? <comment156908> No, it resides in the application folder. I appreciate your help and patience, thanks! <comment156909> Can you check file permissions (`cmd-i` in Finder) <comment156920> The privileges are set to read&write <comment157012> It did work, I managed to load the file nut once I quit the game and launched it again, had the same problem. As if something keeps encrypting that folder. It's maddening.
