Why xterm would run only once on XQuartz? <body> I have codeXQuartz/code running and I can open codexterm/code if I have started codeXQuartz/code just for the first time after rebooting the machine.  However, as time passes, I cannot create new codexterms/code.  So much so that if I quit current codeXQuartz/code and restart just codeXQuartz/code, I cannot get any codexterm/code.  It is annoying that I have to reboot the machine just to be able to use codexterm/code.  I am running OS X 10.11 El Capitan.  I'll appreciate any insight.  Here is the information from codepkgutil/code.  precode$ pkgutil --file-info /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app volume: / path: /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app  pkgid: org.macosforge.xquartz.pkg pkg-version: 2.7.86 install-time: 1445273913 uid: 0 gid: 0 mode: 755 /code/pre  <answer277588> I've had a similar experience when the computer switched or joined networks. Apparently the hostname is used as part of the authentication process to determine if a client is allowed new windows, and locks that in at start time. If you get a new hostname via DHCP, these credentials become invalid. There were some settings I could do to fix it, but I don't remember them (it was not to disable X11 security completely ;-). Try to manually start an xterm from the shell prompt in the existing xterm and throw the error message into Google - that's what helped me to solve it.  <answer277600> strongUsing Keyboard/strong  After selecting/clicking on strongXquartz/strong, you can press strongcommand + n/strong to create how many new strongxterm/strong windows you need.  strongUsing Terminal App/strong  open a terminal app and enter the below command  /usr/X11/bin/xterm  hopes this helps.  <comment272861> Which version of Xquartz are you using? And, did you install it directly, or through some kind of port manager? <comment272867> I am using XQuartz 2.7.8 (xorg-server 1.16.4).  It is the same version on two iMacs.  I am not sure how did I install it.  I thought I did it through App Store but it is not in there. <comment273091> You can use `pkgutil --file-info /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app` to learn if it was installed by a package —possibly downloaded from http://www.xquartz.org—, or [macports](https://www.macports.org) or similar <comment273103> Added info into question. <comment273108> Are you able to start other X11 programs?  Try running `xlogo` or `xclock` to see if your problem is xterms, or any x11 app. <comment273112> Yes, I am able to start `xlogo` and `xman`.  So, the problem is `xterm`. <comment273114> I am able to start `xload` and `xeyes` as well.  I tried to start `xterm` from a terminal but that just hung up in there with no `xterm` on screen and not even in the open applications of XQuartz. <comment274264> I would just try to reinstall; perhaps the `.Xdefaults` file is corrupt. <comment274266> BTW, does the problem persists if you create a new user, and try to open `xterm` from it? <comment274301> I have the same problem on two iMacs.  For now, I am just going to start using Terminal app on one machine. <comment330458> Create a new user, and start `xterm`. Please report result. ↵ My hypothesis is that you put something related to X server in your `.bashrc` which shouldn't have been placed there but in `.bash_profile`. <comment373136> Is this problem fixed?
