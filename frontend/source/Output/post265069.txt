Macbook Display Screen Coating <body> I've noticed a strongblack/strong color coat on my Macbook screen.  It's a very  thin layer coating and whenever I tried to  clean the display,  I got some carbon black dust sticking  to the cleaning cloth.  I would like to know whether I can  re-coat my screen since the layer has been deteriorating ever since.  PS: MacbookPro is 15inch 2013 late December model.  <answer265123> This is a known issue for retina macbooks and apple is aware of this. You can google 'staingate' for more info. There is a replacement program going on, you can read about that here: macrumors You'll have to make an appointment at a genius bar where they will check if it is still covered.  <comment332420> i did notice staingate . The replacement program was only for Macbook Pro's brought after 2015. <comment332422> No it is not, I quote: Apple will replace Retina displays on affected MacBook or MacBook Pro models for free within three years from the date of original purchase, or one year from October 16, 2015, whichever is longer. <comment332423> This does mean that the warranty is expired but for loyal customers apple is known to make an exception <comment332431> I don't see myself lucky enough for replacement program . I was thinking if there is any way I can replenish the coating layer. <comment332433> You can always try, perhaps go to an authorised service provider instead, those are usually more forgiving
