Get nic name and interface via command line? <body> What I am trying to do is to get the interface name and the nic name (description) via command line in OS X.  On Windows the following command gives me the result I am looking for: wmic nic get name, index (this outputs for example: 11 Realtek blah )  On OS X I would like to see: en0 Realtek as the output.  Thank you for your help and sorry for my explanations (its late at night and my english is not so good)  <answer97900> This isn't a pretty way to do it, but it does get you the info you desire:  precodesystem_profiler | grep "Interfaces" -A15 /code/pre  The command is slow, mostly because of how much data codesystem_profiler/code spews out.  But as a summary:  ol licodesystem_profiler/code lists loads of info about the system/li licode|/code is a "pipe" and puts the output of 1 to another command (3)/li licodegrep/code searches for patterns/words, in our case "Interfaces"/li liThe switch code-A15/code prints out the 15 lines following the match./li /ol  Example output:  precode  Interfaces:     en0:       Card Type: AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0xEF)       Firmware Version: Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.106.98.100.17)       MAC Address: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx       Locale: FCC       Country Code: US       Supported PHY Modes: 802.11 a/b/g/n       Supported Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140, 149, 153, 157, 161, 165       Wake On Wireless: Supported       AirDrop: Supported       Status: Connected       Current Network Information:         mynetwork:           PHY Mode: 802.11n           BSSID: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx /code/pre  You can limit code-A15/code to a lower number (say 3) to just get the card id and the Firmware version (i.e. That'll be the chipset).  If that is too much info, you can always get some info on your interfaces with codeifconfig/code or codenetwork setup -listallhardwareports/code, but neither includes info about the chipset/manu unless you want to parse it out of the MAC address (first 6 chars, I think).  Otherwise, you could look into installing codelspci/code, but that is probably in the scope of another question.  <answer98067> With some clever use of awk/sed you could probably get what you're looking for from this output:  precodedefaults read /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces /code/pre  To get the list of interfaces on the machine is fairly straightforward:  precodeifconfig -l /code/pre  Probably best to read that list in and loop through it.
