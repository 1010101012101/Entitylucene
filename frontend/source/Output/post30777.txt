Text expansion for Mac OS X Lion? <body> Is there a built in feature into OS X Lion which is similar to iOS 5.0's shortcut feature? For example, by default if you type "omw" on the iPhone, it gets expanded to "on my way" automatically.  I know that there are probably 3rd party solutions, but I would prefer using an Apple solution.  <answer30779> You can do this in strongSystem Preferences/strong in the emText/em tab of the emLanguage &amp; Text/em pane: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VAmTj.png" alt="Language &amp; Text System Preferences Pane"  You can toggle on/off the built-in replacements, as well as create ones of your own.  <answer30786> As mentioned, OS X (since 10.6) has built-in text expansion capability. However it's also worth mentioning TextExpander.  It does the basic replacement that the built-in utilities do, but it offers a lot more functionality and customizability. For example, you can have it insert variables like the current date, move the insertion point (e.g. you can wrap something in a tag but have the insertion point stay after the word, not the closing tag), or insert new lines.  For many people the built-in capabilities will likely be enough, but TextExpander could be consider the Pro version.
