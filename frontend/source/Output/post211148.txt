El Capitan Homebrew can't reinstall <body> I'm having a problem re-installing homebrew on OS X El Capitan 10.11.1  . When I run the install command for homebrew:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  I get the message: It appears Homebrew is already installed. If your intent is to reinstall you should do the following before running this installer again:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)" /code/pre  But when I run the uninstall command, I get this:     Failed to locate Homebrew!  I also followed the instruction under El Capitan &amp; Homebrew.  After searching a bit I found homebrew under this path:  precode/usr/local/Library/Homebrew /code/pre  and also another file under the same path:  precodebrew.rb /code/pre  SO I tried to uninstall using this found command:  precode/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/uninstall.rb /code/pre  And got:  precode-bash: /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/uninstall.rb: Permission denied /code/pre  So how can I:  ol liFix permissions when it's not needed in El Capitan any more./li liRemove and install Homebrew properly ?/li /ol
