Windows 10 boot in iMac without BootCamp <body> The (quite elderly) parents of a friend have an iMac since years, but having worked with Windows all their lives, they never really managed to get around with it. Being retired they don't have access to their professional computer and they are faced with the Mac. They thought about getting rid of it and buy themselves a PC instead. However, I suggested them to install Windows 10 (OS that they would anyway get if they buy new material) in their existing machine in order to spare some money. I had 4 GB of "leftover" RAM in a drawer that I added in the computer thus boosting the total to 8 GB.  First I installed Windows 10 in a VirtualBox on top of Mac OS (which worked very well), but I quickly realized that it will be complicated for them especially with the keyboard (I don't want to install a second Windows keyboard). With a bit of online search I noticed that although BootCamp refuses to install Windows 10 (restricting any installation to Windows 7 which is not supported by Microsoft anymore) I can install the OS without BootCamp. There are numerous tutorials online that show how to do it (so far I used this one and this one).  However, I faced some issues. Here is what I do (please note that I already have the BootCamp drivers, but at this stage they are not yet needed and the Windows 10 installation is on the same USB key I used to install Windows 10 in VirtualBox – see above):  ul listart the computer/li lipress alt key/li liafter chime select EFI boot/li liReturn/li liWindows splash screen/li lia little while later some points whirling below the Windows logo/li lithen I have to wait approximately 20 minutes it gets to the "Language, Time &amp; Currency and Keyboard" settings/li liclick next/li li"Install now" screen appears immediately/li liclick "Install now" button/li li"Setup is starting" screen which lasts more than 20 minutes/li lithen "Windows activation" screen/li lienter the activation key/li liclick next/li liafter another 10 minutes the licence terms appears/li licheck "I accept…"/li liclick on next/li liimmediately I get the "Type of installation I choose Custom install…" screen/li lithen immediately I get the "Where do you want to install Windows?" screen but with the hourglass pointer (wait another 20 minutes)/li lifinally the installation location screen appears with strongonly/strong a codeDrive 0 Unallocated Space/code (although under Mac OS X I divided the disk into 700GB and 300GB partitions)/li lithen as per this web page I click on New allocate/li litype 700000/li liclick on Apply/li liand nothing else happens…/li /ul  I cannot click on Next, it is greyed out, as are the rest of the options (such as Refresh, Load driver, Delete, etc.)  I therefore have 2 questions:  ul liis there a solution to accelerate the process, in other words not have to wait 20 minutes between almost each event? (I don't think it is a question of USB stick as I can see the access at the beginning of each step, and then there seems to be no access as the led is not flashing, at all)/li lieven though the process is slow, if it is not solvable, it is not a big issue as the installation is supposed to be run only once, but at least get past the drive selection "challenge"?/li /ul  Additional information:  ul licomputer is a Late 2009 iMac/li liIntel Core 2 Duo @ 3.06 GHz/li li8 GB RAM 1067 MHz DDR3/li liGraphics card: ATI Radeon HD 4670 (256 MB)/li liI already tried reseting the PRAM/NVRAM and SMC/li /ul  Thanks a lot in advance for any advice/help.  <comment340910> idk the answer to your allocation issue, however, if you do eventually get Win10 on there, there will be no drivers for hardware that old. That's one reason that Boot Camp restricts what OS you can install on which machine. <comment340950> Thanks for your comment @Tetsujin, but I thought that [Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5722](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1836?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) was for newer models and Download [Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5769](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1837?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) was for older material (like the one I'm trying to install). <comment340957> "This download contains the Windows Support Software (Windows Drivers) you need to support 64 bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 on your Mac." No drivers for WIn10 [& none for 32-bit either] - that's the sticking point, there are no Win10 drivers for that machine. Boot Camp 6 is for Win10 & can't be run on that Mac.
