Is it possible to use an older Canon Scanner with OS 10.11 El Capitan? <body> My Canon LIDE 600F scanner is old but still worked very well. When I upgraded to OS 10.11 my computer no longer recognized the scanner. Canon has officially stated that they are not making new drivers for this product, but I had a similar issue with my tablet not working and was able to find a solution on this site. Does anyone know of a workaround?   <answer237303> strongVueScan/strong might help. Honestly, you're better off buying a new AIO then trying to get these older machines working. You can also try deleting anything related to this Canon scanner that's on your Mac then checking if Preview will recognize it. I was reading here that some people had a limited amount of success doing that.   <comment290425> VueScan might help.

I tried both Vuescan and Preview and they didn't work. I guess it's time to buy a new one. <comment290555> I'm sorry those didn't work.  To help others who might have the same scanner, I'll add my comment to the answer for you to accept.  Then you can add your comments to the answer.  Other people in similar circumstances will know it's better to buy a new one.
