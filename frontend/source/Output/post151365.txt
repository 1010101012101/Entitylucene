iOS 7 and iOS 8 touchscreen bug when unlocking <body> I am experiencing a bug with iOS 7 and iOS 8 that renders me unable to unlock my device (iPad Air or iPhone 5). I have made a video that shows the bug here.  I am not able to simulate the bug with my iPhone 5 because I have not exactly understood what causes it.br Is a way to fix the issue?  Additional details: I have also asked this question here
