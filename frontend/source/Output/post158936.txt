Shuttle like app but for running any command <body> I was really impressed with Shuttle app for mac: http://fitztrev.github.io/shuttle/  I want similar app which can manage the frequently accessed folders/files and commands (like start/stop/restart of apache, mysql server etc.)  Do such app exists for Mac which uses similar json like configuration? Please share.  <answer181920> Actually with Shuttle you can run any terminal command. Just write the desired command instead of the ssh command.
