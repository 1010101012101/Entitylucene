Tag and Metadata searching doesn't work in Spotlight <body> There's a problem with searching for a tags and metadata e.g. kind:movie in my Spotlight. Actually, it doesn't work even tag:Red in Spotlight. It's weird, because I can search easy using Finder, but not using Spotlight. It might be problem with indexing. Can someone help me?  <answer128069> You could try reindexing:  precodesudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  This will reindex the entire drive and all connected volumes.
