Editor/outliner with Newton-style handwriting input on iPod touch <body> Is there a text editor for the iPod Touch that fills the function of the visionary-but-before-its-time Notes application on the legendary Apple Newton? Specifically, looking for something that accepts typed OR handwritten text, freely sketched graphics, collapsable outline with check boxes, etc.?  In other words, is there software for our handheld devices in 2012 as sophisticated as the state of the art from 1996?  <answer37559> h2MyScript Memo/h2  ...fulfills a fraction of your requirement list:  ul listronghandwriting recognition/strong for 30 languages/li liconvert handwriting to digital text or export as image/li licreate sketches/li /ul  I cannot confirm whether this also supports keyboard input.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kJUJu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer37678> Isn't Evernote the app du jour for this kind of thing?    <comment42598> You would need a special pen to write on a touch display. Using fingers for handwriting is not really useful. <comment42622> I still doubt the effectiveness of writing using the hand. Fingers are fat and require more space when writing. On the other hand a stylus does require some effort to write when you cannot rest your hands like one is used to. But a stylus is thin and precise. It does not cover your writing like your finger would.
