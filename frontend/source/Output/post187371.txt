Troubleshoot Dock behaviour in Mac Yosemite <body> When I right-click the Downloads folder in the dock, and select codeOpen "Downloads"/code, instead of the expected thing happening, an app launches.  The app is one I created myself using Automator. And it is on the Desktop. I can move it anywhere and rename it, but this doesn't fix the problem.  Other steps taken to resolve:  ul lireboot - not fixed/li liswitch user to guest account - fixed/li lidelete the app - fixed/li lizip the app, delete the original - fixed/li liunzip the app - unfixes itself!/li /ul  Might be relevant:  ul liI use Quicksilver, but behaviour occurs even when QS is not running/li /ul  System info: Yosemite 10.10.3  Why is this is a problem? Because I want to create Automator apps without them being launched by right-clicking the downloads folder in the dock.  Edit: This is the workflow of the app that launches:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pLW2Q.png" alt="app workflow"  <answer187470> emAnswer for my own question.../em  strongI mistakenly changed the default application for opening folders (!) away from Finder to an application of my own creation. I didn't know this was even possible! Needless to say this had some weird side effects, like the problem I originally described. But I figured it out – I mucked up my system with an erroneous QuickSilver command./strong  I'm always creating dated folders, so I created an Automator app that, given the current folder, would create a folder within using the date as the name.  When teamed with QuickSilver's "Current Selection" trigger, the app becomes useful. I can call my "create-dated-folder.app" from the current folder, using "Open with..." in Quicksilver's second pane, and my app in the third. Works great.  My mistake was, instead of "Open with", I once chose "Always Open With", which changed system settings I didn't know existed – it changed the default application for the "public.folder" UTI from Finder to my Automator app. Then the weirdness began, like if I chose "Open Examples Folder" from Automator's help menu, my app would be invoked. I really had no idea what was going on!  Brilliant tip from to Tetsujin who suggested RCDefaultApp would be worth investigating.  <comment221462> I think we'd need details of what the Automator app is supposed to do, pics of the workflow etc; somehow it's been set to launch that way <comment221467> Good point. I have included a screen shot of the workflow. To your question, the app takes the current folder as input and creates a dated folder there. <comment221468> Hmm… really not sure. Nothing that jumps out. I'd be tempted to have a poke around in [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/index.html#versions) (freeware) - Apps & UTIs tabs & see if you can see what's assigned to it <comment221473> Wow good tip! After poking around in the UTI's tab, "public.folder" was assigned to my Automator app. Once I reassigned it to Finder, it's fixed! <comment221481> Nice find! Glad you got it.
