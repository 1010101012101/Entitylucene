What app places a lower-case 'd' icon in the menu bar? <body> Does anyone recognize this app which has an icon "d"?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a2Dat.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer110593> It's gfxCardStatus in discrete graphics mode.     strongwhat the menu bar icons mean:/strong      i — you're using the integrated GPU.br   d — you're using the higher-powered discrete GPU.   <answer110594> It is gfxCardStatus. You can use it to view and change the graphics mode on your machine.  <comment130267> It's a great application for stopping other applications that try to use the discrete GPU but don't really need it from doing so (and thus degrading your battery life). Coda 2 was the worst offender on my machine, though they say they've fixed it in the most recent release. But I also like to force the integrated GPU when playing Civilization V; the FPS drops, but not to an unplayable level, and I get more battery life and time to play (and less heat and fan noise!).
