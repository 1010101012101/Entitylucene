Where are the POSIX message functions (msgsnd, msgrcv, etc) man pages in Mac? <body> I wanted to view the manual pages for the POSIX standard message functions: msgsnd, msgrcv, etc. All of them are defined in emsys/msg.h/em and code using them works. But the manual pages are nowhere to be found, neither in my computer (Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.3), in my friends' (OS X Lion) or in the developer pages of Apple in Internet.  Where can I download that manual so I can access it right from terminal?  <answer87873> You can download them from http://manpages.ubuntu.com.  For example, to download man page codemsgsnd (3)/code:  ol liSearch for codemsgsnd/code in the Google Custom Search field on the right hand side:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/elZNv.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick on the newest man page in section 3:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VDrSC.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liDownload the linked .gz man page:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2F2C.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liCopy it to the man directory:  ul liIf you want to keep system and additional man pages apart, copy it to code/usr/local/share/man/man3//code:  precodesudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man3/ sudo cp ~/Downloads/msgsnd.3posix.gz /usr/local/share/man/man3/ /code/pre  and add:  precodeexport MANPATH="/usr/local/share/man:$MANPATH" /code/pre  to code/etc/profile/code, if you wish the new man page to be available system-wide, or code~/.bash_profile/code, to be available to your user only (see codeman man/code, that is, codeman/code's man page, for more information on codeMANPATH/code.)   Open a new Terminal window or tab for changes to take effect./li liOtherwise, copy the man page to code/usr/share/man/man3/code:  precodesudo cp /Users/jaume/Downloads/msgsnd.3posix.gz /usr/share/man/man3/ /code/pre/li /ul/li liEnjoy:  precodeman 3 msgsnd  MSGSND(P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual                MSGSND(P)  NAME        msgsnd - XSI message send operation (...) /code/pre/li /ol  <comment102788> As a development issue (these are C calls) this is off topic here and should be on Stack Overflow <comment102796> Man pages are part of the system (or should be) including sections 2 and 3. As long as no actual coding is involved (which would surprise me in this case), the question is suitable both for AD and for SO. For further discussions, please use [this thread](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1642/xcode-questions) on meta. <comment102921> So it's as easy as downloading them onto /usr/share/man/man3. Thanks a lot! <comment102925> Yes, it's that easy :-) If you want to keep system and additional man pages apart, copy them to `/usr/local/share/man/manX/` instead (edited the answer accordingly).
