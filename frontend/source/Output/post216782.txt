How do I rearrange the order of Spotlight categories? <body> I believe I used to have the ability to rearrange the search categories shown in Spotlight, but I can't drag to rearrange within System Preferences  Spotlight anymore (El Capitan). Is there some other way to do this?  <answer216786> Apple removed this feature in El Capitan. I searched deeper in spotlight's plist file:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Spotlight.plist /code/pre  But I can't find any way to re order the entries in this version of OS X.
