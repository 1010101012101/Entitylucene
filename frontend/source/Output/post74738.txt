Information missing from Safari location bar <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How to fix Safari 6 on Mountain Lion that doesnâ€™t show the full URL in the address bar unless I click it?       The address bar of Safari all of a sudden has stopped displaying full URLs, and is instead only displaying the hostname part of URLs. The full URL is only shown when I make the address bar active again as shown below.  images: address bar and  active bar  Can anyone tell me why this is and how I can restore the old behavior? I do have SafariStand installed, but it never did this before today.  <answer74770> I would recommend that you uninstall SafariStand and use GLIMS which is a better Safari enhancement app.  <comment86959> While Glims may be more powerful, it also rewrites Amazon and Ebay links in a way that I'm not comfortable with. I prefer the honest and totally free SafariStand.
