OS X timezone incorrect without internet connection <body> After rebooting my macbook and my wifi is off, usually timezone changes randomly.   ul liI tried to uncheck the "Set date and time automatically" option/li liTried to uncheck the " Set time zone automatically "/li /ul  Nothing helps, I want to set a default timezone/time to remember without internet connection  ( can't really tell if its timezone-related but time/clock is always incorrect after boot without internet connection )  System Preferences shows this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1rWRk.png" alt="Sys Pref"  <answer130043> Is your machine older than 4-5 years?. Perhaps is the PRAM battery (holding the time settings) out of power.   <answer130045> Reset the PRAM, by holding the keys cmd-alt-P-R during startup. If the symprom does not go away, the PRAM battery is the culprit.  <comment152153> What does it show in System Preferences - Date & Time ? <comment152326> its 2013 Macbook Air. <comment152327> @Mark http://i.imgur.com/LWtSz5m.png
