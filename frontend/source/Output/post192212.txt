Why can't I delete Chess.app <body> Why is Chess.app "required by OS X"?  I don't use it, and I can't delete it. Is it really required by the operating system?  <answer192214> No, it is not emrequired/em as such, but Chess is, like any other preinstalled application, protected from deletion. There are ways around it, but it's probably not worth the hassle for a meager 5 MB in disk space.  <answer192215> It is a crucial component in OS X's anti-boredom technology.  Non-troll answer: Yes, you can delete it.  run this command in Terminal:  precodesudo rm -rf /Applications/Chess.app /code/pre  enter your password and push return  <answer192220> I have deleted strongChess.app/strong from every version of Mac OS X and OS X that I've used starting with Mac OS X 10.4.x and have never had an issue from doing so.  You can use AppCleaner to do it, although you first need to uncheck strong[] Protect default apps/strong in its General Preferences.  <comment228551> You caught me.. Deleting apps is more fun than working.. Thanks for the tip. Now I can go to town. <comment228552> Thanks Patrix. It's not the disk space, its looking through lists of apps and files, and at my age, getting distracted. Anyway, I was just curious. <comment228553> Thanks.. Anything else in this category that you delete? <comment228554> and I'm not very good at it. <comment335351> On 10.11 (El Capitan) this fails with `Operation not permitted`. <comment357315> Even though I unchecked that option, the app is still blocked with the lock once you are ready to delete it. <comment357345> @Alex, The OP is tagged for OS X 10.10 Yosemite and this does work as stated under that version and earlier in which AppCleaner provides this functionality. That said, starting with OS X 10.11 El Capitan and later additional measures are needed. <comment357354> Ok, I found that the problem was fixed using the `csrutil disable` instructions in the terminal. <comment361165> Yes. On 10.11 and later, SIP (System Integrity Protection) protects Chess, as Apple is now taking anti-boredom a lot more seriously than it once did. I would not recommend disabling SIP though. The OS is designed with SIP being enabled in mind, and disabling it has proven to get a lot of people into a lot of trouble.
