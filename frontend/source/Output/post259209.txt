My Mac Changes to Light Mode at 7:51 Every Morning <body> I have a mid-2014 Macbook Pro running macOS 10.11.4 and I prefer to have it on dark mode ("Dark Menu Bar and Dock" in "General" in System Preferences). However, every morning at exactly 7:51 it unchecks this box and sometimes right in front of my eyes changes from dark to light mode. I don't ever remember setting this in any setting. I have a small amount of software installed because this is a school computer, but I have asked our IT person and he said the software shouldn't be the problem and that no one else has had this problem. strongAlso, I have f.lux installed. Is there some setting for this or some piece of software that is causing this and what would be a solution or workaround?/strong  <comment324225> Better post changes in console log at  7:51 with screen captures. <comment324226> @FrontENG I'll update it in a day. My computer was asleep today at 7:51. <comment324343> @DylanSiegler I'm pretty sure you have a f.lux setting checked. Look in f.lux settings. Find the "dark mode after sunset" box and make sure it is NOT checked <comment324414> @NoahL I think that did it. Thanks!
