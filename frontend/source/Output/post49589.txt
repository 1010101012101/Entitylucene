-bash: Applications/mvim: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted <body> I am getting a weird error with the codemvim/code script that is supposed to start the MacVim interface.  See below for the issue. code/bin/sh/code is just fine, codemvim/code was codechmod +x/code'd, other code/bin/sh/code scripts run fine... I'm at a loss here.  precodejan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ file Applications/mvim  Applications/mvim: POSIX shell script text executable jan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ head Applications/mvim  #!/bin/sh # # This shell script passes all its arguments to the binary inside the # MacVim.app application bundle.  If you make links to this script as view, # gvim, etc., then it will peek at the name used to call it and set options # appropriately. # # Based on a script by Wout Mertens and suggestions from Laurent Bihanic.  This # version is the fault of Benji Fisher, 16 May 2005 (with modifications by Nico # Weber and Bjorn Winckler, Aug 13 2007). jan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ chmod +x Applications/mvim jan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ Applications/mvim  -bash: Applications/mvim: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted /code/pre  Below you can see that code/bin/sh/code scripts run fine...  precodejan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ vim test.sh jan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ chmod +x test.sh  jan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ ./test.sh  hi jan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ cat test.sh  #!/bin/sh  echo "hi" /code/pre  <answer49590> Hmm, so it seems OS X thought it was a good idea to quarantine my script, for some reason, and not tell me about it.  precodejan@MacBook-Pro ~ $ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Applications/mvim  /code/pre  fixes the issue.
