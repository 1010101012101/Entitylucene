Join-merge-consolidate many audio book CDs into one or a few albums in iTunes 12 / PC? <body> You have an audio book consisting of multiple CDs. In addition to joining the tracks on each CD, you want to merge the CDs. If it's a small book of only a few CDs, then you might want to merge all CDs into one CD. If it's a big book, then you might want to merge (for example) the first 10 CDs into "Part 1"; the next 10 CDs into "Part 2"; and so on.  How do you do it in iTunes 12 on a PC?  <answer174341> strongHigh-Level Steps to Merge Multiple Audio Book CDs/strong  ol liRead the "Meta Data Tips" below (it could save you some time).  /li liLoad CD 1.  /li liSort the tracks into the right order.

Sometimes it happens; sometimes not. I haven't figured out why. I am, however, grateful when multiples are (correctly) moved all at once.   ol start="11" liFind the CDs in your Audio Books. [ View  Audiobooks ]  /li liFor each CD that you want to include in a particular merge, retitle (rename) that CD so that it has exactly the same title as all other CDs in that merge.   [Right-click  Get Info  change the emTitle/em ]. /li /ol  emExample/em: My book has 5 CDs (Superbook Disc 1, Superbook Disc 2, etc. I want them all in one merge. So I change all Titles to Superbook-5CDs. As I change each title, that CD is merged with the other CDs of the same title.  ol start="13" liTo see what you've merged at any time, just click on the new CD title. You should see an expanded list of the CDs contained in that merge./li /ol  strongMeta Data Tips/strong  ul liYou can get to meta data fields by clicking on the "CD Info" icon or by right-clicking and selecting "Get Info." And there may be other ways. Do it one way and you might see a subset of the fields available to you via the other way./li liWhen asked "Are you sure want to edit multiple items?" then, yes, of course you do!/li liBe sure the Disc N of N data is correct./li liWhile working with your first CD, take notes (or a screenshot) of your Author, Composer, etc. meta data so that you can repeat it strongemexactly/em/strong for each subsequent CD./li liKeep your meta data simple. Be sure to fill in the fields that will help you when searching and sorting in iTunes. And to fill in those fields exactly alike./li /ul  You need to be careful about your meta data entries because iTunes is very picky about matching and sorting. Any differences (spelling, spacing, capitalization, punctuation) will likely cause you difficulty in subsequent steps.  For example, mis-matched meta data could cause your imported (and as yet non-merged) CDs to be scattered instead of appearing next to / near each other in different viewing modes.  strongCredits/strong  I pulled the above together over several years (from iTunes 8 until now with iTunes 12). For those of you with older versions of iTunes, here are the sites where I found helpful information:  ul liwww.aldoblog.com (as of 2/24/15 his Audiobook postings are returning 404 errors, though they were working last week.

At least it did for me! :-)  <answer261931> There are instances where the "Join Tracks" does not appear.  Even if you are seeing the tracks from your CD in order, you will not see this option when you select tracks, and click the Options menu UNLESS… you first click the column heading above the track numbers. So here’s the procedure:  ol liClick the column header above the track number (This column heading is blank)./li liSelect the contiguous tracks you with to combine./li liClick “Options”/li liClick “Joing CD Tracks”/li /ol  Hope this helps.  <comment282049> Excellent, excellent anytime the steps can be reduced! <comment329420> How do you do this if you are not getting the books from CDs but instead getting them as digital files? There is no "join tracks" option if you are not uploading from CD. Thx.
