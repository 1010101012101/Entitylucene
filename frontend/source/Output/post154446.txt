Cannot change permission of external ExFAT HDD folders <body> I can't change permissions of external HDD folders The file system is ExFAT and I am on OSX. Here is what is shown when I do codels/code:  precodedrwxrwxrwx@ /code/pre  I don't even understand what code@/code means at the end. Is it the reason why I can't codechmod/code permissions?  <answer154456> The @ at the end of the name means that the Finder has extended attributes OTHER than an ACL but might also be all manner of other things (Finder info for one). You can see what attributes are by codels -le@/code.  <comment181706> Please post the output of `mount` relative to your external HD.
