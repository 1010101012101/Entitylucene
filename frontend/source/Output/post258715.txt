BootCamp: error occurred while partitioning disk. Disk Utility's First Aid says volume is OK <body> I'm trying to set up a Win10 partition on my late 2013 rMBP through Boot Camp Assistant, however I'm getting stuck on partitioning:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oyCzi.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then after heading to Disk Utility, I try using the First Aid option and everything turns out fine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/50J5q.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then I try doing a partition via Disk Utility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0NInh.png" alt="enter image description here"  However I get operation failed due to the disk size being too small:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zdDHY.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have no idea why this isn't working. I'll try to provide as much information as possible, so here is codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            180.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             70.7 GB    disk0s3  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Macintosh HD           +179.6 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  B191F8EE-7EE7-40DF-8711-274537FC4103                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  <comment323575> Your Recovery  HD (disk0s3) should not be 70.7 GB. There are other users you may be able to fix this problem. I can suggest downloading and reinstalling the version of OS X (MacOS) you are currently using. <comment324304> Thanks @DavidAnderson, took 3 hours to restore from time machine backup but everything works!
