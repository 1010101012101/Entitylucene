Siri to lock screen and take screenshot? <body> Apparently, the power button has become pretty insensitive in my iPhone 5. When I say "lock screen" or "take screenshot", I want that iPhone does such activity. Now when I say them, iPhone just googles them that is very stupid. So how can I make Siri to lock screen, screenshot and hopefully other things?  <answer146771> Currently Siri can't do these actions.   One possibility is to enable assistiveTouch :   ul liSettings/li liGeneral/li liAccessibility/li liAssistiveTouch /li /ul  hr  On the assistive touch button :   ul liDevice  next  screenshoot. /li liDevice  next  lock screen /li /ul  <comment172927> Perhaps there is an application that locks screen so I could call an application to do it? Siri definitely finds for application. There must be a solution. <comment172928> without a jailbreak, no app can lock the screen. <comment172929> Awesome! Assistive Touch helps a lot until I get the power button replaced, found screenshot and lock-screen in Assistive Touch, nice app! 14 days' queue in Apple to replace the power button :(
