iOS hotspot + VPN behavior <body> I routinely use the Personal Hotspot feature on my iPhone.  Recently, I have set up a personal OpenVPN server (per here) to use with my phone. However, I don't emseem/em to be able to use both at the same time - which I would like to do so any devices that connect to my phone's hotspot go through the VPN, too (for a few reasons - not least of which is to leverage the pihole server I run for ad-blocking/etc).  Is this possible? Have I just done something incorrectly during VPN creation?
