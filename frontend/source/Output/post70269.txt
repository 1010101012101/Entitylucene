How to use a UNIX console app <body> I downloaded a port knocking script from http://www.zeroflux.org/projects/knock  It downloaded a file knock, which is a Unix Executable File. When I double click on it, it runs the codeTerminal/code, where it writes   precodeLast login: Thu Nov  1 12:19:53 on ttys003 Admins-MacBook-Air-3:~ me$ /Users/me/Desktop/knock ; exit; usage: knock [options] &lt;host&gt; &lt;port[:proto]&gt; [port[:proto]] ... options:   -u, --udp            make all ports hits use UDP (default is TCP)   -v, --verbose        be verbose   -V, --version        display version   -h, --help           this help  example:  knock myserver.example.com 123:tcp 456:udp 789:tcp  logout  [Process completed] /code/pre  But I would like to run it in codeTerminal/code using codeknock [options]/code. How do I do that?  <answer70270> First of all, I assume we're referring to the executable downloaded at http://www.zeroflux.org/proj/knock/files/knock-macos.tar.gz.  Most command-line executables like codeknock/code aren't designed to be double-clicked on in the Finder. Doing so simply executes the executable with no options, so this isn't what you want.  Instead, open a new Terminal window (using Spotlight or in the codeFinder/code from /Applications/Utilities/) and type in something like the following and press return:  code/Users/me/Desktop/knock --version/code  Doing that should print out:  precodeknock 0.5 Copyright (C) 2004-2005 Judd Vinet &lt;jvinet@zeroflux.org&gt; /code/pre  Basically, when you type that stuff into the Terminal prompt, the Terminal executes code/Users/me/Desktop/knock/code and passes it the code--version/code option.  If you were to type in only the following and press return, you'd get the same "unwanted" output as before:  code/Users/me/Desktop/knock/code  <comment81589> So you want to run knockd locally to allow remote access to your MBA? <comment81592> And there is neither a knockd nor a `knock --daemon` for OSX in the downloaded package, it's only the client. <comment82076> yes, i wanted only the client
