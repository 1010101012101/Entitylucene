Deep linking chrome though Safari <body> I am new to this so this maybe a trivial question but I have a private web app that would like to deep link the chrome into it so when users visit it on safari I could give them the option to open chrome through the web app or when they are on chrome to be able to open Safari. However I wasn't able to do that using the URI scheme whereas I was able to do the same thing with other applications other than Safari and chrome (like open Microsoft word) I was wondering if such a deep linking possible and how and if not why?  <comment370900> So you basically want to add a link onto your web page which says "Reload page in Chrome" and, after the user does just that, starts Chrome on the computer of the user with your page open? <comment370901> Something in that sense yes and if I can't do that then maybe just open the chrome app via an actionable button. <comment370902> Deep linkin' is something different! **No deep link**: [Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/). **Deep link**: [Ask Different GotitJS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/249984/gotitjs) ...both linked from another site. <comment370905> @klanomath My initial intent to do what patrix mentioned but I wasn't able to do that and so I wondered if I could deep link chrome app into the web app. <comment370954> What if the user does not have Chrome installed on their device? <comment371809> I am not worried about those corner cases. This is purely towards certain users.
