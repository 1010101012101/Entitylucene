How to change the language on date and time stamp in MS Word for Max 2011? <body> I am using MS Office 2011 for Mac on Macbook air with OSX 10.9.4. In the comment balloon the date and time stamp shows some different language after date. I have added the screenshot of Word document below. How to change it to English? The language in both Word and system preferences is already set to English. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CmNNx.png" alt="Comment ballon with different language in MS Word"  <answer143009> Head over codeSystem Preferences » Language &amp; Region/code and make sure you don’t use strongChinese/strong for Calendar option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TMqRP.jpg" alt="Language &amp; Region Preferences"  <comment168458> As I mentioned in my question, I have already set the language to English in system and word preferences. My calender is set to Gregorian and I don't know where to change the language in calender option.
