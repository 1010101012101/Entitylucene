Dtrace script newproc.d stopped working after upgrade, because of missing proc:::exec-success probe <body> I'm trying to run:  precode$ sudo /usr/bin/newproc.d /code/pre  which suppose to snoop new processes as they are executed, but it fails with the error:     dtrace: failed to compile script /usr/bin/newproc.d: line 22: probe description codeproc:::exec-success/code does not match any probes   This is on OS X 10.11.2 and as far as I remember, this was working before the upgrade.  It seems new OS X doesn't have anymore codeproc:::exec-success/code probe as I've checked by:  precode$ sudo dtrace -l | grep proc:::exec-success /code/pre  Failing code of that script (note: this was provided by the system, I haven't changed it):  precodeproc:::exec-success {   print_pid[pid] = 1; /* This pid emerged from an exec, make a note of that. */ } /code/pre  Is that probe was removed or renamed to different probe? Maybe I could activate it somehow? Otherwise what I can use instead?  <answer231510> This is probably because of the "Rootless" feature in El Capitan.  You can disable this feature by rebooting into recovery mode and running the command codecsrutil disable/code (and you can similarly reenable it with codecsrutil enable/code).  There is a great explanation over at this Ask Different question: What is the “rootless” feature in El Capitan, really? The second answer addresses Dtrace directly.  <answer242852> To be even more secure, you can run:  precodecsrutil enable --without dtrace /code/pre  but this is strongnot intended for production use/strong according to Apple.
