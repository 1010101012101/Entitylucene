My terminal on osx 10.11.6 will not accept `[` character <body> Every time I type it the terminal flashes but doesn't insert it. If I paste in a command that has a code[/code it will paste everything except the code[/code's  This has been happening before I updated to 10.11, but has become a massive issue, I can't use jq at all because of it.  I also have the same issue with iTerm2  ok so I have narrowed it down to this line in my code.inputrc/code ```  <answer275016> So I have found the cause in my code.inputrc/code  precode[[ $- = *i* ]] &amp;&amp; bind TAB:menu-complete /code/pre  I don't know why it's the cause of the problem but it was resolved by removing this, and to be honest I am not even sure what the reason for this being there was  if anyone knows the reason this causes it please feel free to answer and I will accept that answer over this
