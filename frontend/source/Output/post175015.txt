Password Protect one work space alone in Mac OS X Yosemite <body> I used to work with multiple workspaces, putting my dev apps on one space and music apps on another.   I want my Chat apps in one workspace where I want to protect it with my password, because I will be sharing my system with my colleagues while pair programming. So considering this, is there any way I can do this with Mac OS X Yosemite?
