Unable to access iCloud IMAP <body> I'm having no luck adding my icloud email account to either the Evolution, Geary or Thunderbird clients. They all seem to complain about "IMAP username or password incorrect", or similar, although I have confirmed I use the right password by logging into the web interface at codeicloud.com/code with my apple-id credentials.  I'm following the directions in apple's support article, where they themselves sound unsure on what to do (!), e.g.:     Username: This is strongusually/strong the name part of your strongiCloud email address/strong (for example, emilyparker, not emilyparker@icloud.com). If your email client can't connect to iCloud using just the name part of your iCloud email address, strongtry using the full address/strong.   ...usually?  This support article is basically referred to or reflected in every QnA thread out there (except one that claims that omitting code@me.com/code from the username also works for SMTP - not that code@me.com/code directly applies to my case).  I'll concentrate on Thunderbird since it's easy to test it its UI:  Incoming  ul liHost: imap.mail.me.com/li liPort: 993/li liSSL: SSL/TLS/li liAuth: Normal password/li liUser: user.name/li /ul  Outgoing  ul liHost: smtp.mail.me.com /li liPort: 587 /li liSSL: STARTTLS /li liAuth: Normal password/li liUser: user.name@icloud.com/li /ul  Thunderbird tells me "Username or password invalid" (the Geary client does the same).  ul liI have tried both codeuser.name@icloud.com/code and just codeuser.name/code as the username for IMAP and SMTP. I have even tried codemyAppleId@otherProvider.com/code in desperation even though I'm clearly instructed to do otherwise./li liI have written my password in plaintext and pasted it in./li liI have tried STARTTLS instead of TLS (Thunderbird edits the port automatically when I change)./li /ul  I thought I had followed the (unassertive) instructions to the letter, but I must be overlooking something very basic here that I can't see.  hr  Sometimes I get an codeError Creating Account/code alert when trying to connect, doesn't seem very relevant to me though. It has had two different messages:     Incoming server already exists.   hr     [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIMsgAccountManager.createIncomingServer]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://messenger/content/accountcreation/verifyConfig.js :: verifyConfig :: line 60"  data: no]   <comment364126> I get failures using Outlook for Mac via SMTP, because it demands that I enable 2FA on my icloud account to create app-specific passwords - the 'master' icloud password no longer works. I wonder if this might help you. <comment364127> @antonyh Thanks, I'll try it next time
