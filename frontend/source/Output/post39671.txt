Can I use a ZFS ZEVO-managed USB hard disk for Time Machine backups and does it offer de-deduplication? <body> h1ZEVO support for Time Machine/h1  Can I use a ZEVO-managed USB hard disk for Time Machine backups?   h2ZFS dedup/h2  Will ZEVO and Time Machine give me de-duplication (which is sorely missing from Time Machine on HFS+, especially if you backup multiple machines to the same disk)?  <answer39713> Time Machine backups can only be stored on HFS+ volumes. The reason is that Time Machine relies on the ability to create new hard links to existing directories, which you cannot do in ZFS.  <answer39837> In the Time Machine pane of System Preferences, add any ZFS dataset.   For the first backup to that dataset, the operating system will:   ol licreate a sparse bundle disk image (…code.sparsebundle/code) at the root of that dataset/li liattach the image, after which you'll see a volume named emTime Machine Backups/em./li /ol  For each subsequent backup to that dataset, the OS will:   ol liattach the image, after which you'll see the emTime Machine Backups/em volume./li /ol  Time Machine routines with ZFS are similar or identical to the routines that apply when backing up to a device – such as an Apple Time Capsule – that uses AFP.   hr  How can one recover from TM after new/reinstallation? New OS installation knows nothing about ZFS to TM image is unreachable.  <comment44941> How about HFS+ in a sparse bundle on ZFS? This is how Time Machine works over the network, right? Would that work (and give me the benefits of de-duplication and encryption)? <comment44996> @Thilo: Yes, in principle, that should work. As far as de-duplication and encryption go, I don't remember from what ZFS versions those are available. But if Zevo offers them, you should be OK. <comment45351> Good point. Probably only works in combination with a file server (as a restore over the network), or by copying the sparse bundles over to a disk in a supported format. <comment45425> FWIW, the "Silver Edition" (the only one available today) does not support de-duplication (needs Platinum) or encryption. <comment63550> Please: the question about *restoration* should be separate. There will be a multiple answers, which could become confusing under the [opening questions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/39671/8546) about *backup*. <comment63552> For the comment about encryption … [How can ZFS be used with encryption on OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/52919/8546) <comment63556> Wish for the restore interface of Time Machine to work with ZFS snapshots … a fuller answer will fit better under a question about restoration. <comment63568> I refuse to think about restoration separate from backup. What is the point of a backup if not to later restore it? <comment63668> No offence intended. I may revisit this question after the banner of changes, which appeared around the time of WWDC, is lifted from the ZEVO web site. <comment64894> [Time Machine, ZFS and deduplication](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/35958/8546)
