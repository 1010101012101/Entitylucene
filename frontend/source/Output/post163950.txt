Is there a way  to use kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdnumber/kbd to switch to purpose application.  such as when i press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdtab/kbd , i want to switch to the sixth application , i just press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd6/kbd, the command tab will focus to the sixth application.  Just like switch tabs in chrome. use kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdnumber/kbd Is there a proper way to do this???  IS there any software can do this?? or system apis can do this??  <answer163951> No, but if you use the mouse you can kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdtab/kbd and then click the one you want with the mouse.  <answer163952> You could use Automator to create services that take no input and consist of "Launch Application" [your favorite app here], and then assign a keyboard shortcut to that service using System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services.  <answer163972> Manico is a Appbr Using Option + Number key to launch or switch to the target app in an extremely fast speed!

I use Ctrl/number. Trouble with wanting the 6th app is you have to look at which is currently 6th. Using Spaces means they're always the same number, once assigned.
