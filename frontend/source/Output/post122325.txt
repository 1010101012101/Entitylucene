It is possible to create/install an iOS app like the macOS parental controls? <body> Is it possible to create a app like macOS parental controls in iOS for giving permission for accessing certain apps on the device?  <answer122334> The sandboxing applied to all iOS apps does not allow this. You can enforce some restrictions via Settings-General-Restrictions but compared to Parental Control the options are rather limited.  <comment142749> thanks @patrix, i have to control the child from playing games so i can hide the other applications from our applications.. <comment143326> You could use [Lockdown](http://ioshacker.com/news/lockdown-pro-ios-7-becomes-available) if you're willing to jailbreak.
