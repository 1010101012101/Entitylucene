Video file uploaded to iCloud drive does not appear <body> My iPad says the video I created, and want to edit in iMovie on my laptop, was exported to iCloud Drive as a photo file. iCloud drive is active on both my laptop and desktop but is empty on both and in iCloud.com. I only have one Apple account.   Further, although I have Photos turned on under iCloud Drive on my iPad, I see no Photos folder on my computer in iCloud. And the iMovie folder is empty.  I see a similar question from October with no answer.  <comment192069> maybe this wil help http://video.about.com/ipad/How-to-Set-Up-iCloud-on-an-iPad.htm
