Macbook Pro 8,1 not charging <body> A week ago, I found an old strongMacBook Pro 8,1/strong (13” MacBook Pro, Late 2011). It was working fine, but the battery wasn't charging. The charging lights on the side of the MacBook said that it was fully charged, but when I unplugged the charger, it turned off instantly.  Why is this happening and what can I do about it?  Note: I installed Ubuntu so that it would run faster, but I do have a backup of macOS.  <answer288206> The battery on that MacBook Pro is dead. You could:  ol liHave Apple replace the battery for you. However, since your laptop is most likely out of warranty after 6 years, this will cost you a pretty penny./li liBuy a replacement battery and replace it yourself using these instructions from iFixit. The procedure is rated as easy and the page includes a video guide./li liUse that laptop as a desktop replacement (permanently plugged-in). You’ll need to be extra careful to avoid data loss, considering the MagSafe connector will come unplugged very easily. You may consider duct-taping it in place./li /ol  <comment364042> Thanks, Phong! I guess i'll get a new battery and replace it my self.
