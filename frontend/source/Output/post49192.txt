iPhone + Messages Beta: prevent iPhone from vibrating for every message? <body> I'm using the Messages Beta on Lion to receive iMessages on my MacBook Pro. I also have my iPhone set up with my iMessage account.  When I receive a message, it's delivered on both devices. If I read the message on my computer, it disappears from the lock screen of my iPhone, so it doesn't fill up during a conversation.  But, this doesn't prevent my iPhone from vibrating emevery time/em I receive a message â€” and if I'm having an extended rapid-fire iMessage conversation with someone using my computer, this can get annoying. Is there any way to prevent this from happening?  <answer49193> I'm afraid that's not possible in the current iOS.    But there are a few work-arounds:  ul liYou can define a specific vibrating tone for that specific contact person which will do almost nothing (unlike the default long and hard vibrating)/li lior you can disable vibrating when you enter Silent Mode and when you start having this rapid-fire conversation, just switch your iPhone to silent mode and no vibrating will happen!/li /ul  <answer98147> Nowadays, this seems to be more of a timing issue, and I think Apple has improved the system overall. Basically, it's no longer an issue.  <comment56349> I figured this would be the answer... thanks for the alternatives, though!
