Cmd click on top of Xcode used to open a Finder - this no longer works in Yosemite <body> I used to be able open a Finder window by Cmd clicking the title at the top of the Xcode window.   However, in Yosemite, with its new slimline display, the title is no longer shown.  Is there a fix or an alternative way of doing this?  <answer164558> I now crtl click on the Project container or a file inside to get to the Project folder or file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F1kQr.png" alt="enter image description here"
