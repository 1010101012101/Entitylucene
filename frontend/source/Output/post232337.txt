iOS 9.3 on iPhone 5 (Night Shift option is unavailable) <body> I recently updated my iPhone 5 to iOS 9.3 and there is a new functionality introduced as "Night shift" option.  However it is not available on my iPhone 5 Any thoughts as to why?  <answer232340> It's not an error â€“ it's because of the processing architecture. The iPhone 5 is an older model, and Apple isn't going to support 32-bit devices for Night Shift.  <comment283871> Can you please expand your question with more info about what you have tried? Also, a screenshot of Settings  Display & Brightness would be good.
