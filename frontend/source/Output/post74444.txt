How can I open Google Chrome in Presentation mode using a shell script <body> Previously in 10.6.8, I was able to start Google using  open /Applications/Chrome.app --args --kiosk http://www.google.com  Now, on newer systems, that does not work anymore correctly. The only way to get rid of the address bar seams to be using of the presentation mode. Does anyone know the switch to call that mode?  I use the shell script for a presentation computer to start the browser on startup automatically in fullscreen mode.  Any help is appreciated.  <answer103620> I tested this out and then it wouldn't let me exit kiosk mode. I had to kbdCmd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd to get out of Google Chrome. Save the following to a script, something like codeChromeKiosk.sh/code and codechmod +x ChromeKiosk.sh/code to get it to run.  precode#!/bin/bash open "/Applications/Google Chrome.app" --args --kiosk http://www.google.com.au /code/pre  This will open Google Chrome to the codehttp://www.google.com.au/code webpage. Change it as you need. Copy and paste the rest of the script  If you want to turn it into an AppleScript so that you can create an application that can in turn be automatically run each time the computer reboots to a default specified user, use the following code and when you save the script, change it's type to Application  precodedo shell script "/bin/bash open \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app\" --args --kiosk" /code/pre  It's requires the code\/code em(escape sequence)/em before the code"/code because of the way the shell reads the spacing between the words strongGoogle/strong and strongChrome/strong in the filename. You can also write it as   precodedo shell script "/bin/bash open /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --args --kiosk" /code/pre  It's just that I've never favoured the look of seeing a escape before a backslash. It's too messy. Stick with either the BashScript option at the top or use the 1st of 2 AppleScript lines and save it as an Application type.  <comment86451> Check this on Super User: http://superuser.com/questions/209980/mac-osx-start-google-chrome-in-kiosk-mode-error ... Seems like kiosk is broken in Lion+ and the work around is AppleScript. <comment125589> I made a nice little native application that will do this for you now too - http://danijeljames.github.io/Chrome-Kiosk-Mode - download the DMG file.
