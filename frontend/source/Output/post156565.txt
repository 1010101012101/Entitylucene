New iPhone 6 - hints in Notifications <body> I have been receiving new iphone 6 hints in my Notifications but when I go to try one out and go back to read it again it is gone.   How do I retrieve them and where do they do they come from?  <answer156569> They are from a new app called Tips, added with iOS 8.  It will post occasional tips &amp; tricks on your lock screen, but you can launch the app itself &amp; browse through them any time you like.  <comment184290> Thanks but the App is not in the App store? <comment184385> no, it's a core app, like Stocks or Weather - you can't delete it & it's not in the store.
