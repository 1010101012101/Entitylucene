To add these, drag the item to the toolbar (when you're not running the toolbar customization sheet. Adding a separator bar from the customization sheet will make dragging things to the toolbar easier (aim for the divider, then the Finder will know you want to add the item to the toolbar, rather than, say, copy the item to your Applications folder).  A couple of other tips if you weren't already aware of these. Hold down Command-Option and click on the toggle-toolbar button (the oblong button in the upper right) to immediately invoke the customization sheet.  You can also hold down the Command key to allow manipulation of the toolbar items without having to use the customization sheet. For example, if I no longer want my Apps folder in the toolbar, hold down Command and drag it out of the toolbar and release, and it will poof  like when you remove an app from the Dock. Or, you can hold down the Command key and drag the toolbar items to the left or right to rearrange them.  Also, hold down the Command key and press the toggle-toolbar button to cycle through the different toolbar viewing modes (for example, text or icons, and large or small size, etc.).   <comment5389> I am talking about - adding new ones that aren't shipped by Apple. <comment5390> @sugar - that was already covered in my answer, so I edited it to make it more obvious. <comment5391> Oh ! That's great. :D
