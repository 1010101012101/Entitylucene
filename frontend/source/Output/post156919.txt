My erase junk mail is grayed out <body> The option to erase junk mail does not show up when I right click and in the menus it is grayed out. Any idea how to get it back.  I am running Yosemite, 10.10 on an iMac.  I couldn't find anything using google except someone else with the same problem and no answer.  Thanks.  <answer156920> Try to set your settings to the what you see below, this may fix your issue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1RjGy.png" alt="Junk Mail Settings"  <comment202791> The 'Move it to the junk mailbox' setting enabled it.
