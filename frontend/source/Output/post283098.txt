Controlling appearance of DropBox badges in the Finder <body> I have an oldish MacBook Pro with Sierra version 10.12.4, and Dropbox 25.4.28.   Sometimes I find the Dropbox badges distracting, depending on the folder and what I am doing with it.   They are less of a problem for me when the folder contents are shown as a list, but in some of the Finder's as Icons views they really get in the way.  I can work around the problem in a few ways, but I was looking for a way to tell the Finder (or the Dropbox software installed on the computer) to change something like the size or contrast of the badges.   I don't see any controls in the Dropbox preferences.  Nor do I see anything in the Finder preferences or System Preferences.    I wonder if there's something I'm missing.
