How do I launch shell applications after changing shell to MacPorts bash? <body> I have installed a current bash version via MacPorts and changed Terminal.app to use code/opt/local/bin/bash/code. Unfortunately shell applications won't launch from Finder and Spotlight anymore. (OSX 10.8.2, Bash 4.2.37)  <answer66417> I've just changed the login shell and left Terminal's settings unchanged.  ol liSet the shells open with setting back to the default login shell in Terminal's preferences/li liAdd code/opt/local/bin/bash/code to code/etc/shells/code/li licodechsh -s /opt/local/bin/bash/code/li liOpen a new tab and check codeecho $BASH_VERSION/code/li /ol  <comment78126> Which shell applications? Can you give an example or some additional info? <comment78391> This did the trick for me. Strange enough, the GUI (`Preferences  Users & Groups  right click on account`) does not show the shell added to `/etc/shells`. Thus, only `chsh` works here for me.
