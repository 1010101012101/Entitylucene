What "defaults" command is used to enable NTFS write support in OS X <body> I remember long time back I came across some terminal command (something like: codedefaults write.../code) to enable ntfs write support on OS X. When I am searching for the command now I can see only either of the below options:  ol liUsing 3rd party software like Fuse/li liUsing /etc/fstab/li /ol  I had enabled ntfs support without any 3rd party software or modifying /etc/fstab. But I don't remamber the command now. It starts something like codedefaults write.../code. Can anyone help me on this?  To cross verify my memory, I checked my system and I don't have any 3rd party software for the same installed and do not have anything in /etc/fstab but I am able to write to NTFS.  Currently I am looking for the old command I used so that I configure the same in another mac.  OS Version - Yosemite  <answer220798> In ElCapitan there is no fstab file, and I doubt very much if there is a possibility to write NTFS without a third party driver such as Tuxeira NTFS  or  Paragon NTFS.  <comment267285> The OS X NTFS driver does indeed have write support. The only way I know of to enable it is to use the fstab, which does indeed exist at /etc/fstab, and I don't believe was ever a folder. <comment267289> Possible duplicate of [How do I write to NTFS drives in OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20889/how-do-i-write-to-ntfs-drives-in-os-x) <comment267290> The etc/fstab file [not folder, as rightly said, may not already exist, but is easy enough to create. <comment267300> This is not a duplicate of the said post. That post doesn't talk about the defaults command I am looking for. <comment297019> The fstab file simple needs to be created.
