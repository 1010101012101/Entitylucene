How can I modify the list of Applications under 'Open With...'? <body> I recently went to open an audio file, and wanted to open it in an editor instead of a player. I right-clicked it, hovered over 'Open With...' and was met with a very unsightly list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jNL9k.png" alt="List of Supported Audio Apps"  I have seen a problem in the past where apps will have previous versions stuck in the code/Applications/code folder with their version number appended, but that is not the case here. Despite the duplicity in this list, no app is duplicated in code/Applications/code nor anywhere else I can find on my system.  What causes this list to become filled with duplicates, and how can I remove them and ensure only the latest (and functional) version is list?  <answer64126> Applications don't have to live in code/Applications/code. If you have a clone of your system mounted, that can account for some duplicates, but certainly not what you are observing. The list of programs for strongOpen with…/strong is maintained in the strongLaunch Services/strong database. If the list contains many duplicates as yours does, the database looks like it needs rebuilding.  Macworld Hints offers a suggestion as to how you can fix this:  The codelsregister/code command, found at codeSystem/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister/code, can tell the database to reset. Macworld recommends running the command thusly: code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user/code  Note that utilities like Onyx or Cocktail can also reset this database for you. Do note that Finder won't re-read the new database so you will either have to log out and in again or issue a codekillall Finder/code if you don't mind just killing it for any users on your Mac to avoid a log out and in.  <answer64582> Once you have checked in spotlight to be sure you don't actually have a backup drive or another volume with duplicate copies of the apps (in which case Finder is showing you all the apps that it knows about that can open the file), try running a command to rebuild the launch services database:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  Then log out, and log back in again. This should rebuild the Launch Services database for OS X, removing all duplicate entries.  <answer68285> I just had this bite me on a fairly clean, new Mountain Lion install where I had several versions of apps and I think I have a workable idea how the duplicates came about in my case.  I run this Air in clamshell mode and probably pulled it while it was asleep and the launch services database didn't clean up for the apps that were mounted on my external drive connected to my cinema display.  I have a 3 TB drive with several bootable Lion and Mountain Lion installs which correspond exactly for the number of system and third-party apps I have that would be expected to register to open a jpeg file:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eJ6MF.png" alt="Open with..."  Just as with the other answers - forcing lsregister to kill the database and kicking Finder patched me up in less than 20 seconds  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain user -domain local -domain system killall Finder /code/pre  <answer68534> I've run into the issue where there are backups of my apps on an external drive. If I have those drives indexed or launched apps from those drivers, then they show up in the list.  <answer129185> CleanOpenWith is an application I created to clean the Open With… menu.  CleanOpenWith is open source and free. The application automates these steps:  ol liOpen Terminal: strongApplications / Utilities / Terminal.app/strong/li liType in the following command :    precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre/li liWait for that command to complete/li liIf no error then proceed to the last step, restarting Finder/li liRestarting Finder does not require you to reboot your Mac. Simply press kbdControl/kbd + kbdOption/kbd while clicking on the Finder icon in the Dock, select Relaunch and you are set!/li /ol  <answer234038> I know this is an old thread, but for me, what cleared this up was going to "Force Quit" and then relaunching the Finder.  Problem occurred on a 3 day old iMac totally up to date.   <comment75221> This will help with the duplication, and has worked for me several times, so +1. Do you have anything to help the OP with the second part of the question: how to EDIT this list? <comment75275> @Redandwhite Actually, he answered my questions to the extent that I meant them. By edit it, I really did mean just delete the dupes, and lsregister will do that for me. If you'd like to edit it outright, [ask it as your own question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask). The best part of that is, you'll get the upvote rep for yourself that way :). <comment75326> Well, he answered my questions, but unfortunately that [didn't resolve the problem](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XFtxE.png). The list remains identical after running the command given in the answer. The image linked in this comment shows that I'm fairly confident that there is only one copy of the Spotify app bundle on my system despite the amount shown in the list. <comment75351> I take it back. The process appears to just have taken some time to run, but I viewed 'Open With...' not 2 minutes ago. The list is clean again. Yay! <comment75352> Yay! Glad it worked for you. I've been digging and I haven't come up with a better answer, so I'm glad this one worked. <comment76156> Great! Glad it worked for you. <comment79596> Rebuilding the Launch Services database (which that command does) *should* fix this. Were there any error messages printed when you ran it? <comment79839> Yes I have a Timemachine backup disk connected. Howto exclude those old Applications from Menu? <comment92410> @CDK, This sounds more like a comment than an answer. <comment95112> possible duplicate of [How do I remove duplicate "Open With" context menu items in Finder.app?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10523/how-do-i-remove-duplicate-open-with-context-menu-items-in-finder-app) <comment124708> This is an old topic, but I ran into the same problem. Simply add your external drive's application folders to the spotlight exclude list: http://superuser.com/a/349054/82434 <comment124710> @emb1995 This problem happens even when you have only one Drive due to a bug in how the App store downloads updates. I don't have a good explanation why Chrome and other non MAS files are duplicated, so perhaps there are more than one bug or a nasty interaction once it starts to corrupt things in the database and the damage spreads. <comment124716> Yeah. I know about the bug, but it looked like everything was working as intended for you, it's just inconvenient for people like us with multiple installs. I might look in to `lsregister` sometime to find the database and other related code, but perhaps this issue is fixed in Mavericks. I wasn't experiencing that problem with the GM or DPs. Haven't installed the Public Release yet. (odd... I can't mention you in my comment) <comment151203> I created an app to clean the open with menu. You can download it [here][1] and find more information about this situate and the underlying process [here][2]. Hope this helps.

Thanks! <comment186698> This seems to have busted my OSX UX experience. Now half the time I pick Open With I get a "fetching..." and it takes  20-30 seconds before anything appears. I've never seen that in the previous 5 years of using a Mac. How do I get it to stabilize? <comment243579> Do you happen to know a way to rearrange the list in a specific order, or add or remove some applications from the list?
