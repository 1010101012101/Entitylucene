How to decode a .chm file? <body> I'd like to extract content of old code.chm/code file into individual html files.  Is there an app or command line tool for this?  <answer82204> Perhaps http://echoone.com/filejuicer/formats/chm will do the job for you.  FWIW, my chm to HTML workflow differs though. I use iCHM app (http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/28171/ichm) for OS X to convert chm to PDF to preserve formatting. After editing it (using Adobe Acrobat) as necessary, only then do I convert to HTML.  <answer148482> For $1 (instead of $18 for FileJuicer) you might consider this app:    h2CHM Decompiler/h2  It worked correctly for me. (I have no relationship with the developer, just a happy customer.)  <answer234440> Tubby.  From the website:     emTubby is no longer maintained or supported./em It is a CHM file expander,   opening Combined HTML Help files and outputting their contents in a   folder of the same name. You can access the source on the side and use   as you see fit.      Requirements. Tubby runs on Mac OS X 10.3.9 or higher.   <answer246225> This is pretty easy to do for free you just have to use Terminal and install Homebrew and chmlib.  ol liOpen Terminal.
