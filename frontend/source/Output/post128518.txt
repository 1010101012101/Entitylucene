How to remove a book from iBooks <body> I "bought" a free book on iBooks Store, the book is on my iCloud.br Now I would to remove it, but I cannot find a way to do it.   <answer128571> First, delete the local copy by selecting it and pressing codedelete/code and then confirming by pressing the "Delete" button in the confirmation dialog.  Now if the book is displaying with the iCloud icon you can hide the iCloud purchases,  by clicking on the "Sort By" menu and making sure "Show Purchases in iCloud" is unchecked. If that was already unchecked, then the book's icon will simply disappear.  <answer128713> On the Mac you can tick codeMenu &gt; View &gt; Hide purchases/code (I work on a Dutch system, so I hope this is correct); on iOS you can do this in codePreferences &gt; iBooks &gt; Show all purchases/code.  You can hide all unwanted books in iTunes on the Mac foreverâ€¦  <answer144412> To Delete a book from  the iBook library :   ol liClick on iBooks /li liClick on the desired book you want deleted (But be sure the book does not pop up )/li liNow right click , Click on delete/li /ol  Now The Book Is Deleted  <answer152130> ul liOn a Mac, open the iBooks app./li liGo to the iBooks Store (left of the toolbar, at the top)./li liOn the right-hand-side, in the Quick Links list, click the Purchased link./li liBooks will appear; find the one you want to remove and hover your mouse over the cover./li liA little 'x' will appear; click it to remove the book./li /ul  The book will no longer come up in iBooks (or any other locations), no matter whether you have set iBooks to show or hide iCloud items.  <answer178643> Under iOS, it is possible to achieve the same thing according to this page  ol liOpen the iBooks app./li liTap "My Books" at the bottom of the screen./li liTap "All Books" in the middle of the upper bar./li liSwitch on "Hide iCloud Books" at the bottom of the screen./li /ol  That's it !  <answer266749> For iOS, what worked for me was:  ibooks / library / choose the view=pdf's or books (note that pdf are always downloaded but books can be in app store aka cloud only)  / click button on right 'select' / choose one or more books to remove / click 'delete' / choose the kind of deletion. I choosed keep in cloud and just remove the download. This just saved me almost a GB.  <comment150547> have you tried selecting it and hitting the delete key? <comment150566> @amergin: yes, no way. <comment150625> a bug or a feature? :) <comment150632> It's definitely intentional, so I'd call it a feature. <comment150753> The OP was asking about iBooks, not iTunes. iTunes in Mavericks only deals with audiobooks, not PDF files or iBooks purchases. <comment150756> This is simply not true:-) if I open iTunes on the Mac and view my purchases, I can view all my purchased books and hide them. If you prefer iBooks on the Mac, you can do exactly the same thing from the iBooks Store  Purchases tab. <comment150764> I think I found what the OP was looking for. I've updated my answer. <comment150814> I already found how to remove the local copy and how to hide the iCloud copies, but I would to *remove* the iCloud copies. Thanks anyway <comment166333> I have the same problem. It can't be removed. Logic is that when one "buy" something electronically, it can't be thrown away. It's in list of your purchases remaining there forever. You can just hide it. <comment170135> For books on iCould there is no *Delete* in the pop-up menu. <comment267172> This is very annoying. I also have quite some free books I "bought" that sit in my iBooks and there is no way to permanently delete them. Some book titles are very embarrassing and I'd like to have those completely removed. I am not looking for hide and unhide. Any solutions? <comment267321> That's hide only. My research seems to tell me there is no way to delete any. <comment288481> It sounds like this process requires a Mac? How does one do this on an iPad/iPhone? Some books on my iPad have the "Delete" button greyed out. lauhub describes a way to "hide" them on iPad, but perhaps only a Mac can delete them permanently? <comment288660> I can't see a way of doing it on iOS, unfortunately.
