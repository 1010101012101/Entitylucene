All Music Off iPhone <body> I have an iPhone 4S, and I recently upgraded to Spotify Premium (it's awesome) and want to clear all the music off my iPhone (through the normal iPod app).   Thing is, I use iTunes Match so plugging into iTunes won't let me wipe it all out - and there are a lot of artists that I want to delete - it would take a long time.   Is there any way to expedite the process?  <answer43990> This isn't through the iPod app, but it (should) delete all the music from your device.  Settings  General  Usage  Music  Edit (button, upper right hand corner)  "-" button  Delete.
