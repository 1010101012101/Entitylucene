Launchd based daemon exit with abnormal code 1, without crash log <body> I've seen many questions that relate to specific daemons/applications that exit on this same exit code (=1). All scenarios seems unique and unconnected.  I created a daemon of my own, and also got the same sudden exit with exit code 1. If i could't only realize the meaning of this error code...   unfortunately, there's no crash log with backtraces i can look into, so i deduce it's a planned process termination...  is there any documentation which describe abnormal code per index ?   perhaps it's  connected with my plist. I've added 2 keys that might be relevant : KeepAlive and RunAtLoad.   thanks,   <answer237667> Ok, I've just realize that i left codeexit(1)/code in my code. this was part of non deamon leftovers, and that what caused the abnormal exit.
