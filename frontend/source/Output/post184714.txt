Some apps are greyed out in iTunes when attempting to sync iPhone <body> I'm trying to sync (not for the first time) my new iPhone 6 and MacBook with OS X 10.10.3 using a USB cable.  Why would some of my apps that are on my iPhone (they're working) be greyed out in iTunes when I look to see if there are any to remove or install?  How do I return them to the proper colors?  <comment219023> Whilst device version information is useful information, the title to your question should be as descriptive as possible regarding what the *problem* is that you are facing. I've edited the title to explain what I believe the actual problem is, but feel free to edit further. <comment238213> possible duplicate of [Why are my updating iPhone apps "waiting..." forever?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4657/why-are-my-updating-iphone-apps-waiting-forever)
