Is it possible to validate XML in Xcode? <body> I need to validate XML. I know that Xcode has some support for XML, such as highlighting and collapsing. However, I'm having trouble figuring out how to run actual strongvalidation/strong of XML from within Xcode. There are other XML tools that can do this that are available on Mac, as mentioned in this broader posted question, but I was just curious about Xcode specifically.
