Can I import songs I downloaded into garageband on my iPad, with no laptop fileshare? <body> Im a rapper, so all I want to do is import a beat onto garageband and record my vocals over that. Problem is I don't have a laptop, just the iPad. I have downloaded instrumetals on other apps. Is it possible to import these files into garageband just using the iPad(as this is all I have at my disposal)?  <answer81045> I created a:  Garageband Mac to iPad Oneshot Converter at the fixed1t blog.  http://fixed1t-music-software.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/mac-garageband-to-ipad-one-shot.html  it has links to free trial software, youtube video and an ebay purchase Â£5.  <comment87971> Which other apps?
