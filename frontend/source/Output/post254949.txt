Text message forwarding no code showing <body> I have 4 iPhones with iOS 9 and 2 iMacs with El Capitan, all with same apple id.  2 of them are not forwarding messages to the iMac anymore and cant get the text message forwarding code showing up. (the other 2 are working fine)  Tried sign in/out, re add apple id, network reset, iMac restart, start conversation with email, with phone number.  Nothing seems to work, the code doesnt pop up on the iMac.  Any suggestions, whatsoever highly appreciated!
