How to stream iTunes content to Chromecast <body> Is it possible to stream my iTunes moves and TV series to my Chromecast?  I've found some solutions on Google but I'd like to avoid tricky transcoding processes.  What's the easiest solution?  <answer131524> If you have actually downloaded the file, simply drag it into the Chrome browser - it will play your file locally and you can stream it from there.  I don't know of any solution built into iTunes that would allow you to stream directly to the Chromecast.  I do this with iTunes U lectures all the time.  <comment165532> You can open spotify web and play music. Video, not sure?
