Change font in Console.app in macOS Sierra <body> How do I change the font used in macOS Sierra? Has Apple actually taken away the ability to set the font?   Currently in macOS Sierra the codeSFMono/code font bundled with the app seems to be in use. I cannot find any menu item for fonts, nor can I find any toolbar button available for accessing fonts.  The context-menu for the content of a Console.app window offers a codeFont/code  codeShow Fonts/code item. The standard font-picker appears. But choosing fonts in the picker has no effect on the Console.app window.  <answer293974> Unfortunately you can't change the font for Console.app OOTB with macOS 10.12.x.  Console.app uses the font that is located in the application itself ^. If you delete it, which is not recommended, the default font it will revert to Helvetiva.  ^ code/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/Contents/Resources/Fonts//code.
