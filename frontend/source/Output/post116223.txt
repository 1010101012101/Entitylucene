Finance App That Charts Bank Info? <body> I'm looking for a finance app that will connect to my banks so I can see My balance at the end of every day, week, month.  I would like to see how it rises and falls just so I can keep a better eye on my money.  Are there any dashboards or apps like this?    If there is an app that syncs with an iOS app that would be great  <answer116238> I believe Mint.com does exactly that: https://www.mint.com/how-it-works/accounts/  They have a website as well as iPhone and iPad apps.  <comment135979> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/100220/what-os-x-and-ios-software-combination-tracks-finances?lq=1 for a fairly thorough list.
