iTunes 10.6.3 opens every time I put in an audio CD <body> In system preferences CDs &amp; DVDs I have everything set to ignore. Yet iTunes still opens every time I put in an audio CD - is there a way to turn this off?  As a follow up in iTunes  Preferences  General  When You Insert A CD: I have the following options  ul liShow CD (The selected option)/li liBegin Playing/li liAsk To Import CD/li liImport CD/li liImport CD and Eject/li /ul  There is no ignore option within iTunes - is there some other way to disable iTunes opening?  <answer55973> In iTunes you can go to preferences  General  you can choose among:  – display br / – play br / – import br / – import and eject br /  just choose display. It seems that you can't get rid of this trouble.  <comment64357> What version of iTunes are you using I have the following options (Show CD, Begin Playing, Ask To Import CD, Import CD, and Import CD and Eject) <comment66055> OK... they are the same but with different name
