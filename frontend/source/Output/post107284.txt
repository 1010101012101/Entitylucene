How can I remove a VPN service when the remove button is disabled? <body> I added a VPN config. Now I want to remove it, but the strong-/strong button is gray and disabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KIM3g.png" height="300"  I checked some answers from this Apple Support Communities thread:     In Terminal: codenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices/codebr   In Terminal: codenetworksetup -removenetworkservice networkservice/codebr   In Terminal: codenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices/code     …but I cannot remove all.      How can I fix this issue?  <answer107302> You can manually delete the service by removing it from the relevant preferences file.  Make sure System Preferences and any other software that may attempt to switch network locations is quit before beginning.  ol liMake a backup of the preferences file.  precodecd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration sudo cp preferences.plist preferences.plist.old /code/pre/li liGive yourself permission to the preference file.  precodesudo chown $USER preferences.plist sudo chmod u+w preferences.plist /code/pre/li liOpen the preference file. I will use Xcode to open the file.  precodeopen preferences.plist /code/pre/li liUse ⌘F to open Find, and search for the name of your VPN service.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AAHHq.png" width="550"/li liThe name of your VPN should be shown in a codeUserDefinedName/code key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PLdPh.png" width="550"/li liSelect the ID of the network service above the search result.  In this case, I would select the one beginning codeCD2362/code…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mc94x.png" width="550"/li liUse kbd⌫ backspace/kbd to delete the entire dictionary. Make sure that the only data that is deleted is this dictionary and its contents, not any of the other dictionaries./li liSave the file and reboot./li /ol  <answer191142> To remove the VPN Profile from your Mac:  System Preference  Profile  Vpn One Click  Remove.  <answer278038> In macOS X Sierra after coming across https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3828655?tstart=0 I was able to delete a VPN item that had a greyed out "-" button, even thought I had deleted the "Profile" it was associated with. I did so by the following commands:  1: In terminal, codenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices/code gives a list of the names of the services.  2: In terminal, codenetworksetup -removenetworkservice "name of service in quotes"/code will remove the desired service - the quotes are needed to take care of spaces and other fancy characters - they could be escaped with backslashes (\) instead. This might be the bit that messed up the original author.  3: In terminal codenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices/code gives a list of the names of the services, hopefully showing that the undesired one is now gone.  <comment126142> I will try it... <comment129903> yes it works， thank for your hint
