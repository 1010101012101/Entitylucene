Wi-Fi turning on and off since Mavericks upgrade <body> MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013  Since upgrading to Mavericks, the Wi-Fi turns off for roughly 8 seconds and turn back on for roughly 8 seconds. I have tried this on several different networks in different physical locations. It seems to be the exact same symptoms as described in this Apple Support Communities thread - even turning Wi-Fi off manually doesn't help (it just turns right back on again).  I tried this and rebooting, but it didn't work     Try backing up and then deleting this file:br   codecom.apple.airport.preferences.plist/code      from this folder:br   code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code   In fact, none of the suggestions in the thread seemed to work.   I would rather not go through the trouble of downgrading since Ethernet works.  <answer131276> Turns out there was a custom script running under a subdirectory of code/Library/Scripts//code on this laptop. It looked something like this:  precode#!/bin/bash  dscacheutil -flushcache if ifconfig en0 | grep inet; then      /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en1 off     /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en2 off else     /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en1 on     /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en2 on fi /code/pre  Commenting its insides out fixed the problem The Wi-Fi no long periodically disconnects. I'm guessing that between 10.8 and 10.9, one of the commands in that script changed.  <comment130154> Downgrading to 10.8.4 immediately fixed the issue. Also, I realize that this would be considered hearsay; however, a gentleman from the help desk where I work mentioned that Apple has acknowledged this issue and there is yet to be a fix.
