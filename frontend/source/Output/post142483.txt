How to close a window without the application quitting? <body> The OS X menu allows exit, minimize and maximize:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8KTPX.png" alt="enter image description here"  br /I know the following shortcuts:  Exit:      kbdcommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbdbr / Minimize:  kbdcommand/kbd + kbdM/kbdbr / Maximize:  ?  When I use kbdcommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd to exit the behavior differs from clicking the red button.  I want the UI to close and the application to remain running.  Instead, the application exits entirely.  How can I accomplish this with a keyboard shortcut?  <answer142484> kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd will close the application's window, leaving the application running in the background.  There are a few exceptions to this (iPhoto, etc) but the majority of applications will have this behavior.  <answer142485> Typically, an application will offer a way to both close the UI and quit the application. These are usually standardized to kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd to close the UI/window and kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdQ/kbd to quit the application.  Some applications will still quit entirely when you use kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd, such as Preview. You can usually rely on this shortcut to close the window without quitting, however.  I should also point out that the red button in the top left does not "quit" the application as you mentioned in the question body. It will close the window (just like kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd).   <answer142498> You can use kbdcommand ⌘+H/kbd to hide one entire application. Only the dock item will be visible. However, it's better to have an app, that uses a menubar item ("Menubar App") and allows you to completely hide the dock item while running.  <answer142505> It depends on the type of application   If the application is multi-document (.g Safari, Preview)  i.e. can have several different documents open in several windows then kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd will close the current window and leave the application running (until possible it is shut down if the OS needs more resources)  If the application has just one window e.g. App Store, System preferences then closing the window will also close the app. Thus kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd and kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdQ/kbd do the same  <answer142542> You always have the option to emhide/em the active program. When the application in question is emactive/em (in front of all others) there are 2 options:  ol lioption kbd⌥/kbd+click on the Desktop/li licommand kbd⌘/kbd+h/li /ol  The first option always works or at least I can't think of any exceptions this minute. The second is supported by emmost/em applications.  In either case:  ol liYour session will be preserved./li liNeither will cause these windows to be displayed in the Dock where the minimized programs are located./li liYou'll need both hands. /li /ol  So, if you're scanning eBay at work, you'll likely only look suspicious. But, if you lean into it and use kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⇥/kbd (command+tab) PLUS kbd⌘/kbd+h in succession, you might actually look like you're doing work.  But, in the event you're asked to bring your browser back to the forefront you'll be busted. It will display exactly what you were looking at when you hid it.  You can imagine how I know this code:-)/code  <answer145597> strong'Alt F4' on Mac/strong  I recently started working with Mac and this was the first thing i researched. Its surprising that no one knows of this command even tho its in the official 'docs'.  ul licmd + shift + w -- closes window with its tabs/li /ul  apple shortcut page  <comment168012> I experienced much success with ⌘+h! <comment168110> Glad to pass it along  :-) <comment185814> Best answer for chrome, but still not equivalent to clicking on the cross for all apps <comment185846> well its a shortcut ;-) you probably want to do this when you have to instantly close all tabs in that window without aiming the mouse to the close button. <comment186859> The question is how can you have the same behavior as clicking on the red button with a shortcut. Cmd+Shift+W is the exact answer for chrome, but mot app won't support this shortcut. I am still looking for a shortcut that has this behavior in all apps <comment254516> In tabbed apps `Cmd+W` closes the current tab. In such cases `Cmd+Shift+W` usually closes the current window. <comment365272> This should be marked as the correct answer <comment365273> sounds like the answer to your question is command + W  for most applications... I think that should be marked as the right answer <comment365280> @GarrettSimpson - Why is + W better than + h?  I've been using + h for several years now with success.  I can't think of a reason to switch to +W.  And I don't see a clear explanation in any answer. <comment367105> i said that because command + h hides all the windows for a program, but command + W closes the open window, which is what happens when you press the red button.  You can try it out yourself with multiple windows in chrome.
