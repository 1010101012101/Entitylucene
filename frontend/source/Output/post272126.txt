"macOS Sierra Update" could not be verified <body> I tried updating my new MBP from macOS Sierra 10.12 to 10.12.3 using the App Store. I can see that the download of the update file finishes in App Store. I also get the prompt to restart. The machine restarts after approving it and it starts the update process. The update suddenly stops and shows an error message:     strong"macOS Sierra Update" could not be verified./strongbr   You can try updating again in the App Store after restarting.   I took a screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6d0Y.jpg" alt="macOS Sierra Update could not be verified"  After pressing Restart, the machine restarts and macOS Sierra version is still 10.12. I tried several times to update again using the App Store but it gets stuck with the same issue. Any hints how to complete the update to 10.12.3?  <answer272127> I was able to update by using the combo updater for 10.12.3. The DMG file can be downloaded outside of the App Store and I can explicitly know that the file is good because it verifies itself.  <comment365007> Did you get mac os sierra 10.12.5 updates from AppStore as well, or again the combo updater i.e. https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1918?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US  ?? <comment365240> Nope, it worked seamlessly at least for me by 10.12.5.
