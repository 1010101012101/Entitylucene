How to change physical layout of the keyboard <body> I bought my Mac in Spain. I cannot find change keyboard type in Keyboard preferences. I have set to English language but many keys are physically different.  How do I change the physical layout of the keyboard to standard British keyboard?  <answer225811> OS X includes an British keyboard layout that you can switch to under codeSettings &gt; Keyboard &gt; Input Sources/code. If you hit the code+/code button and search for codeBritish/code it'll come up. That'll give you Apple's version of a British keyboard layout.  If you'd like British to match a PC's keyboard, there's a second Apple mapping named codeBritish - PC/code.  This'll put the code@/code and code|/code symbols where they should be in that layout.  You might find that Apple's codeBritish - PC/code keyboard mapping isn't quite right, as because their British keyboards aren't laid out as a typical British (BS4822) keyboard is. There's a great solution for this with a custom keyboard mapping. The one I linked there works like a charm.  <answer225949> Besides using the UK-English keyboard layout get some replacement stickers and stick them carefully on your Spanish keyboard.  <comment217680> You want to change the actual physical buttons? Why didn't you just buy your Mac in the UK then? lol. Also I guess you can pull them off and replace them with english mac keys, but ermm... may not work well. <comment217682> This may help: http://www.dotkam.com/2011/01/04/edit-keyboard-layout-on-mac/ <comment217920> Thanks Dan. Will try Ukelete. I bought the Mac in Spain because I have a home here. <comment217948> Ah fair enough. Hope that helps :)
