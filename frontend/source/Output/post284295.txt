Preview and Skim are not opening Latex compiled pdf file <body> I am using codelatexmk/code to compile file written in codeLatex/code in OS X (macOS Sierra : 10.12.4) to codepdf/code.  Recently I am facing that such pdf files are not being opened through codePreview/code or codeSkim/code pdf editor! Earlier I didn't have such an issue.  Any fix?  <answer284303> My machine has MacOS 10.12.5 and MacTeX-2016 and it works fine, both with Preview and Skim. I used the command-line in Terminal. Here are what codelatexmk --version/code and codepdflatex --version/code report on my system, respectively.  precodeLatexmk, John Collins, 22 April 2016.

Still no luck. :( <comment359661> Sorry, I missed your answer. Do you get any error message? If you do `open your.pdf` in Terminal, do you get any info? For the record, my version of Skim is  1.4.29 (103). Also could you copy me the output of a fresh latexmk run? <comment368034> @LucBourhis Sorry, what output do you want? The printout on the screen (but there's no error in Latex)?  My Skim version is the same as yours. <comment368051> I was wondering whether `open your.pdf` in Terminal would print some warning or error. <comment372469> @LucJBourhis No error message on the terminal. I can send you the crash report if you want through conversation.
