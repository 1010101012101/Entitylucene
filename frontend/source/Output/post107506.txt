Sync Google contacts and iCloud contacts <body> I use CardDav to get my Google Contacts on my iPhone, which works great, but I would love it when those contacts were also in sync with iCloud contacts.  Meaning when I add John Doe in Google contacts it will show up in iCloud (eventually) and vice versa when I add Jane Doe in iCloud it will show up in Google contacts.  I've got an iPhone 4S with iOS7 and a MBP with Mavericks.  <answer108571> Just saw a question similar to yours, Apple does not allow sync of contacts between various cloud accounts (i.e. between Google and iCloud), however you can use this tutorial to transfer or copy contacts from one iPhone cloud account (Google) to the next (iCloud).  <answer111074> Actually I just copied my iCloud contacts to Gmail (copied, not synced) just by following those easy steps (I believe Maverick is required but not sure though):br/ - Add both your iCloud and Gmail account to Mavericks' account manager (in the System prefs) br/ - Open the Contacts app on your mac (You should see two different contact folder on the left: iCloud and Google)br/ - Click the iCloud one, select all of your contacts (cmd+A, shift+click, whatever)br/ - Drag'n'Drop them from iCloud to Google.br/ - Voil√† !br/  (It took me more than 5 minutes to converts my 350+ contacts)  <comment126091> I'm linking this to [that](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107225/how-to-sync-contacts-between-icloud-and-gmail-with-mavericks) question if this threads gets an proper answer. <comment127272> Do you have a reference for "Apple does not allow sync of contacts between various cloud accounts"? Thanks <comment127371> Example: try to merge Gmail contacts with Yahoo contacts on the iPhone. <comment130754> I'm sure this works except this is not a answer to my question. I want to keep them synchronized that means no converting, copying, dragging and what not..
