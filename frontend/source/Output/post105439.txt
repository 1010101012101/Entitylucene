Ignore closed lid after wake on demand <body> I plan to use a three year old MacBook Pro as a Plex Media Server. It should wake on demand and go to sleep when I don't watch anything. That works great, but only if the lid is open. If the lid is closed and the MacBook Pro is sleeping I can wake it but after a minute it goes bak to sleep no matter if I am watching something right now or not. I thought a tool like NoSleep could help. But this tool prevents the Mac from going to sleep when closing the lid. When it is already closed and sleeping NoSleep has no effect. The Mac will go to sleep again after a minute.  Is there another tool or configuration which simply tells the MacBook Pro to ignore the status of the lid? I can't imagine that this isn't possible.  <comment124016> If you are on 10.7 or later, one thing you can try is to run [sudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/105420/using-only-an-external-monitor-with-a-macbook-air-or-pro/105424#105424) and restart. It should restore the pre-10.7 clamshell mode behavior, where when a laptop is connected to an external display, the laptop goes to sleep when you close the lid, and the internal display stays disabled even after you open the lid.
