What's the difference between `brew tap caskroom/cask` and `brew install brew-cask`? <body> There seem to be different ways to do similar(?) things:  ul licodebrew tap caskroom/cask/code/li licodebrew install brew-cask/code/li liand even codebrew cask/code alone does something on a fresh install/li /ul  <answer293047> Homebrew is written in Ruby, which uses Perl's motto of "There's more than one way to do it" to cater to every special interest, to the confusion of newbies.  bmike thinks this is important:     Also - the handling of taps / casks has changed over time. On Homebrew   1.2.4 you can jump straight to installing from cask and the best guide on getting started that's current is:      ul   lihttps://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/USAGE.md/li   /ul   But it confuses me as codebrew install caskroom/cask/foo/code does the same as codebrew cask install foo/code.
