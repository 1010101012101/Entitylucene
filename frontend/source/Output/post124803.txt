Installing Bootcamp 5.1 on Windows 8.1 <body> While trying to run Bootcamp 5.1 on Windows 8.1 (which is claimed to be supported here: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1720), I am getting the error message "Boot Camp requires that your computer is running Windows 7".  Is there something I am doing wrong?  How do get the proper drivers installed on my Boot Camp install of Windows 8.1 on my Mid-2011 Macbook Air?  <comment146089> Is your mac running 10.9 mavericks? <comment146237> Yes, it is running Mavericks.
