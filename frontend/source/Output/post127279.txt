Recover Time Machine without the password <body> I'm having a issue with a Time Machine backup made on an external USB drive. The TM backup is encrypted and I can't remember the password â€¦ Does anybody know a tool to brute force the password ? (I remember the password is about 10 characters and alphanumeric (except for a "!" somewhere).  I'm running Mavericks.  <answer127291> Have a look at libfvde. It doesn't explicitly say it supports Mavericks, but might be worth a try.   <answer127496> Trust Me, there is no tool to decrypt the encrypted hard disk. there is no way to recover this   <comment149186> What would be the purpose of strong password if it can be cracked. Giving that kind information here would be wrong. <comment149372> i answered because i am sure this will doesn't work, i experienced this year ago and i lost my data, in order not to waste his time, efforts and money, That's my point thank you for clarification. <comment149373> Please include some details, a one-liner does not have much details and the URL might die. <comment149380> I tried to clone the source repo, but it's empty :-/ Edit: I didn't see the download link when I checked, I'll try this one tonight. <comment149406> Anybody willing to do some calculations here on how long it would take to brute force a 10 digit alphanumeric password, including the time it takes to try each combination against the drive?
