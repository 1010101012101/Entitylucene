Is there a URL scheme for the Music app that allows me to link to a playlist? <body> I have started using Launch Center Pro and I'd like to create a shortcut for a playlist on Music. Is this possible using the URL scheme of the app? If so, how?  <answer276931> You can use the iTunes url and append &amp;app=music.  it will look for the song or album on the iTunes catalog and start playing it locally:  https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/clair-de-lune/id319190952?i=319190960&amp;mt=1&amp;app=music  Note that this plays the first of nine songs in the query response this creates.  <comment81511> I donâ€™t think any exists, because Music app cannot be used to open any content files, and it does not access content from the internet. <comment81512> That's kinda what I was thinking..
