Altering behavior of Option + arrow keys in Numbers for Mac <body> In Numbers, pressing kbd⌥ (option)/kbd+kbd→/kbd (or with any other arrow key) will add a row or column in that direction, relative to the currently selected cell. This is a useful shortcut which I employ frequently, and I don’t want to turn it off.  However, I’m used to using that shortcut in text editing to quickly move the entry cursor around, by words rather than characters.  strongWhat I would like is to have kbd⌥/kbd+kbd←/→/kbd add new columns emexcept/em when I’m editing a cell’s contents./strong  I can simply reassign the keyboard shortcuts if necessary, but I’d like to know if what I ask is possible.
