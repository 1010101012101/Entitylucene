Remove Duplicate Shared Computers <body> After my upgrade to Yosemite, I am seeing a couple of extra shared computers in my finder sidebar.   There are two additional computers that seem to be copies, based on their naming, having (#) appended to the computer name.  After checking all computers on my network, I can see that this issue is not only on one machine, they all show the same list. Additionally, I can verify the duplicates do not exist as I cannot connect to them.  I have tried the following:  ul liRenaming my machines/li liDisabling / Re-enabling sharing/li liRestarting All Machines / Performing all necessary updates/li liClearing recent servers from each computer/li liRestarting Airport Extreme/li liRelaunching Finder on each machine/li /ul  Here is a screenshot displaying what I see in my Finder window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c5ePy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189498> strongUPDATE:/strong Updating to 10.10.4 fixes this problem. In this point release codediscoveryd/code is replaced by the previously ousted codemDNSResponder/code.  emThe originally supplied answer follows.../em  This is caused by an interaction with a daemon called codediscoveryd/code (that is present in Yosemite OS X 10.10.0 to 10.10.3) and the sleep proxies that are present within Apple TVs and Airports.  I outlined a workaround here; which is basically disabling em"Wake for Network Access"/em.  em9to5Mac/em reports that codediscoveryd/code has been dropped in OS X 10.10.4 beta and replaced with the previously ousted codemDNSResponder/code daemon. So this problem should be fixed in OS X 10.10.4.
