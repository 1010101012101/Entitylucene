I installed python via the package downloaded from the python website  <answer238398> The issue is that your $PATH environment variable finds Apple's python 2.7 before the python.org one in /usr/local/bin  One way is to run the script as code/usr/local/bin/python/code  Or run as codepython3/code  Another is to alter your path so /usr/local/bin is before /usr/bin . This has bee described in many questions  <comment292367> How are you starting it? and what is your PATH? <comment292369> python -m  its a bunch of py files in a directory. <comment292371> any your PATH is - what does `type -p python` show as the executable that python is? <comment292372> /usr/bin/python <comment292514> You can also do `python3 **program**` instead of just `python **program**` which will use the other version.
