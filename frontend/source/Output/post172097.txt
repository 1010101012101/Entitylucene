Is My iPhone 5 Fixable? <body> My iPhone 5 does not turn on. If I connect it to the USB, it repeatedly shows Apple Logo, then turns black. I updated both the iTunes and Mac OS, with no effect on the situation. Any suggestions?  <comment202581> Did you try a factory reset ? http://support.apple.com/en-la/HT201252 <comment202582> Yes, I did. Not useful. <comment202583> Then unfortunately no. <comment202585> tried Recovery Mode? http://support.apple.com/en-la/HT201263 <comment202586> @Tetsujin yes, I did. Didn't work. <comment202587> then I'm with Matthieu - time to take it to Apple
