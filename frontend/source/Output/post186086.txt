Restore Firefox & Thunderbird user data from Time Machine <body> I have a fresh installation to which I want to transfer my Firefox and Thunderbird user data. I have my Time Machine backup available from Other backup disk and could in principle restore the hidden Library folder. However, I don't want to migrate everything from my old Library to the fresh install.  Which Firefox and Thunderbird user data folders do I have to migrate to my fresh installation?  <answer186092> The User Data folders for Firefox and Thunderbird are:  precode/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Firefox /Users/$USER/Library/Thunderbird /code/pre  You might also want to migrate the em.plist/em files for them as well:  precode/Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox.plist /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.thunderbird.plist /code/pre  Make sure the applications are close before migrating the folders/files.
