iOS in-app purchase: Keeping consumable counter in keychain, do I need to document export compliance <body> The answer to iPhone - in-App purchase consumable correct approach on stackoverflow is very appealing for keeping track of consumables in the keychain. However, using the keychain for this purpose (not username/password), will it trigger the need to document export compliance?  <answer246919> The general consensus I've heard is no, it does not trigger export compliance. The OS is the one handling the encryption, not your app.  <comment304685> @patrix, regarding being "off-topic", I actually posted this on Stack Overflow first, but I considered it to be more appropriate here, as the question is not really about software development, but commercial/compliance implications of a technical solution. <comment304687> Ah, on rereading the question I would agree :-) Thanks for getting back to me for this.
