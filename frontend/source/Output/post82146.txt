How do I install Linux on a late 2012 mac mini? <body> I installed a 2nd hard drive in my late 2012 mac mini. This hard disk had Mint Linux - 12 on it (Installed when it was in a different computer). Pressing the kbdOption/kbd showed me two additional hard disks one of which successfully booted Mint.  I later decided to install a different (newer) distro and recreated a partition table. I installed the new distro from the flash drive (worked out of the box). Now , pressing the option key does not show the 2nd drive at all. Although once I am booted into the Mac OS X, I can see the partitions and the disk in the Disk utilities.  What do I have to do to see the 2nd disk in the list that shows up on pressing kbdOption/kbd at boot time?  <comment120894> I managed to format the disk again after quite some trial - error to get back my disk options.
