what is /usr/share/dict used for <body> Where is this used, I read the README and it didn't say what program it was from, I do not think that it is the stock dictionary app because I tried some very obscure looking words that were in some of the files and they did not come up in the stock dictionary app.   Any idea where this comes from?  <answer245983> The origins go way back as a place holder for the dictionary codewords/code used by the codespell/code utility. codespell/code is not available but the program codelook/code will use the codewords/code dictionary. You could use one of these alias/function courteous of Wilfredo Sanchez Jr. to do word look ups.  For ksh, zsh, and bash   precodeword () { grep -F -i "$*" /usr/share/dict/web2 ; } /code/pre  For tcsh  precodealias word  'grep \!* /usr/share/dict/web2' /code/pre
