How to change turn-by-turn navigation voice language in Google Maps for iPhone? <body> I have my iPhone's language set to English in Settings, but I live in a non-English speaking country. As such, when using turn-by-turn navigation, street names are pronounced as though they were English words, and are barely recognizable.  Is there a way to get Google Maps' navigation feature to speak my language without changing the systemwide language setting?  <answer80255> Unfortunately, Google Maps doesn't have Language controls built into the app. It cues off of the settings in Settings.app  General  International.  The only way to have Google Maps speak a different language is to change the actual settings in Settings.app  General  International  Language.   Of course, this doesn't take long to change, and it may be desirable to change it before using turn-by-turn for perhaps a long trip.  It would be a good idea to request that feature from Google by opening the Google Maps app and tapping the person icon in the upper right corner. Then tap "Send Feedback" and compose a request to Google.  h2Minor Update/h2  You can now set voice search language in the app. There is a mic icon on the right in the search box that you can tap to basically dictate the location. While that doesn't apply to your question, perhaps that would be a first, mildly helpful step.   <answer239799> I changed the phone language settings and it is the easiest fix, and will help you improve your Spanish, or you could try a different GPS app  <comment262698> an alternative answer for you but the waze app have such setting
