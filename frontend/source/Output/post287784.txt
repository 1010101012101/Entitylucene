AppleScript runs on Sierra (10.12) but not Yosemite (10.10) <body> I have an automator action that has a "Run AppleScript" action in it, that is running a shell script. Along with actions before and after this one, everything runs fine on my OS X Sierra Mac, but when bringing it to a OS X Yosemite Mac, it gets an error. Can anyone see where I have lost compatibility with this code? Thanks!  strongRun AppleScript Action:/strong  precodeon run {input, parameters} set pPath to POSIX path of ((path to me as text) &amp; "Contents" &amp; ":InsertedResources") set OriginalPathway to (item 1 of input) set OriginalFileList to (item 2 of input) do shell script "cd" &amp; " " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of OriginalPathway &amp; ";" &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of pPath &amp; "/bwfmetaedit --out-core=original_metadata.csv " &amp; OriginalFileList return input end run /code/pre  strongError on Yosemite:/strong  precodesh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `" /code/pre  I have checked to make sure that my quotes are all ascii, and they are. Thanks for any help in advance!  strongUpdate/strong  Just attempting other things with same result. Thought maybe building the shell script in AppleScript before sending it to the do shell command might help it out, but still comes up with same error on 10.10. Additionally, I added a display dialog of the output text that it is sending to the "do shell" command, and I can copy and paste what is output into terminal and it works fine. It's just when running via this AppleScript that it won't work.  strongUpdated Code:/strong  precodeon run {input, parameters} set pPath to POSIX path of ((path to me as text) &amp; "Contents" &amp; ":InsertedResources") set OriginalPathway to (item 1 of input) set OriginalFileList to (item 2 of input) set ShellCommand to "cd '" &amp; POSIX path of OriginalPathway &amp; "';'" &amp; POSIX path of pPath &amp; "/bwfmetaedit' --out-core=original_metadata.csv '" &amp; OriginalFileList &amp; "'" display dialog ShellCommand do shell script ShellCommand end run /code/pre  <comment363391> Can 10.10 run something simple like `osascript -e 'do shell script "echo hi"'` ? If so, then try adding bits of your command (possibly with `echo ...` prefixes to show the command that is being generated) until things break. <comment363441> Thanks for the reply. Yes, I was able to do that but I'm not skilled enough to know how to pass the variables to the AppleScript inside of the shell script to fully test. I did however test with hardcoding pathways and everything seems to run fine.
