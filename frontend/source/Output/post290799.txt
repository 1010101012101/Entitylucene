Clear Messages history without reboot <body> I have an app that deletes your Messages (formerly iChat) history in macOS. Its open sourced and freely available to fork or modify on Github  strongWhat's worked so far.../strong  If I run the following commands in terminal the emMessages/em history is successfully removed from my system and the script works as expected.  precoderm -rf ~/Library/Messages/* rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ichat/Data/Library/Messages/Archive/* osascript -e 'tell app \"loginwindow\" to «event aevtrrst»' /code/pre  I also tried killing the process for MessagesKit but that didn't do it either.  It works by removing the files from code~/Library/Messages/code which can be easily found using a web search for "Delete Messages history macOS".  Where I am stuck is that in order to make it work I need to trigger a full reboot of the OS. Ideally this would work without having to resort to that.  I tried clearing the cache in code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ichat/Data/Library/Messages/Archive//code but that doesn't seem to help. Hoping someone can shed light on what I'm missing or if this is even possible.
