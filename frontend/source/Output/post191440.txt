Blurred fonts - Monitor NEC EA274WMi - MacBook Pro retina 13 - Yosemite <body> my new monitor NEC EA274WMi looks sharp when connected to windows but blurred all font texts once connected to OS X. It's very annoying, I work with user interface, small texts, labels, icons.  I tried all every cables and adaptors: display miniport, DVI-D and HDMI. Same problem.  Other monitors with the same issue have solved forcing RGB mode instead of YCbCr, but this patch haven't worked for me http://embdev.net/topic/284710  Is there someone with the same NEC monitor that have resolved (or haven't) this issue?  Thanks in advance for any help.  Ste  This is my configuration:  Monitor NEC EA274WMi, MacBook Pro Retina, 13 inch, late 2012, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB, OS X Yosemite 10.10.3  This is a screenshot from my desktop, can you see how blurred is the number 1 in the red square aside the stack exchange logo?   img src="https://i.imgur.com/O12LKcS.png" alt="blurred"  <answer191442> Try disabling LCD font smoothing. Go to the Apple menu, choose System Preferences, then choose General. It's the last checkbox at the very bottom.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KDN0H.png" alt="Screenshot of OS X General preference pane in System Preferences with LCD font smoothing circled"  <answer191458> Recently I had a similar problem with mail. Reducing transparency under "Accessibility" in System Preferences solved it for me. It seems to be a bug with font rendering.  <comment227353> Already tried with no success, thanks Chris. <comment227369> Already tried this too without success, thanks Awado.
