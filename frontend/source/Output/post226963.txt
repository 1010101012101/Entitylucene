Problem with Macbook and Display Detection <body> I have a Macbook with a removed monitor so now I use an external monitor.  My notebook doesn't always correctly detect the resolution (or, I think, the display).  When it doesn't detect correctly, I need to reboot and wait for some time or else reset the NVRAM.  I created a small video so that you can see how it is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzROZpK998w  <comment275654> It's possible that you're having GPU issues. What is the model?
