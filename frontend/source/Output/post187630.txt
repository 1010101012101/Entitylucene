Safari printing issues <body> Lately when I try to print from Safari (Version 8.0.6 (10600.6.3)) on the latest Yosemite, the job won't be printed, keeping the "Printing..." status forever. That happens every time.  If I save whatever from Safari to PDF and then send the PDF to the printer, it printed it without issues.  There is no related logs on the console.app when this happens.  So, anyone faced this kind of issues? How can I print from Safari again?  By the way, my printer is a Canon LBP 3010, that works fine with any kind of program/document except Safari.  <comment221851> Anything of note in the print queue? prefs/printers & scanners  open print queue… or the error log, Printer menu [once print queue is open] <comment221853> Nothing. It's really strange. <comment221855> So the job never gets to the queue at all? At least that would push the issue more squarely at Safari itself; never actually sending it. Anything at all in Console as you try to print? <comment221858> No, to both questions. <comment221859> hmmm… other than checking for an incompatible extension, I'm not really sure - other than start picking out com.apple.safari files in case one of them is corrupt… [not an enviable task] Unless… maybe [Cocktail](http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/) would be worth a look, that can test prefs files, amongst other things
