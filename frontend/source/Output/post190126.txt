Can a MBA 2014 output 2560x1080 at 60hz? <body> I've got a MacBook Air 2014 and I want to hook it up to a LG 29UM65 monitor.  The native resolution is 2560x1080. Can the MBA 2014 (Thunderbolt 1) output at that resolution at 60hz?  <answer190138> I bought a few of these panels last month on special.  They are great. I just tried to hook up my MBA11 2014 to the display and here are the options I got.     It doesn't look like it does 2560x1080     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r8p1R.jpg" alt="MBA11"  Here is what I get when I try it on desktop mac img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e98r7.jpg" alt="Hackintosh display"  <comment225777> That's pretty definitive! Thank you for taking the time to do this.
