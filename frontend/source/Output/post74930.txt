How can I rotate my signature in Preview? <body> I have scanned my signature and can insert it just fine, but at the wrong angle!  How can I rotate it (90 deg)?  <answer75215> To rotate the whole image:  ul liOpen the image file in Preview/li liClick "Tools" in the menubar/li liClick "Rotate Left" or "Rotate Right"/li /ul  To rotate only part of the image  ul liOpen the image file in Preview  /li liSelect the signature part/li liHit Command-x to cut or Command-c to copy/li liHit Command-n to make a new file from the cut or copied part/li liClick "Tools" in the menubar/li liClick "Rotate Left" or "Rotate Right"/li liHit Command-a to select all/li liHit Command-c to Copy/li liIn the first document, hit command-v to paste the rotated part/li liCopy and paste small background-colored areas to fill in where the original signature was/li /ul  <answer79933> I ran into this problem and found that I could work around it with codeFile &gt; Exportâ€¦/code. After closing the original and opening the exported version, the signature orientation was correct.  <answer83403> I did not export it but I copied the signature on a blank Pages document.  I found that after I closed it, and reopened it, the orientation was correct.   <answer86837> This thread addresses the problem best:   https://discussions.apple.com/message/16821750#16821750  Basically the issue is with Acrobat formatting scanned PDFs in a way that makes Preview think it is rotated.    The answer above about exporting to a new PDF and then trying to insert a scanned signature in the new PDF via Preview's annotation tools works to fix the problem.    <answer90897> I've been having the same problem, but I solved it by opening the pdf file in Preview, hitting codeFile &gt; Duplicate/code, then adding the signature in the newly created file. This corrects the orientation of the file so that Preview can identify lines and you can just click on them with the signature tool (from the Annotate/Edit toolbar) and add your signature.  <answer101569> I ended up scanning a new signature in sideways via the camera. So now I have a rotated signature and a normal one should the issue come up again.  Hopefully Apple fixes this at some point.  <comment87373> Thanks, David - but that rotates the PDF File - not the signature :( <comment87462> Have fixed. Try now. <comment87485> Hi David. Thanks for wanting to help but still not working. Are you aware that Preview has a built-in signature annotation tool? (Open preview, open a PDF file, choose Tools - Annotate - Signature)  I think you're referring to rotation normal images in preview, not signatures (which cannot be copied by commanda-x or command-c). The signatures are added by going to Preferences (still in Preview) - Signatures. <comment106744> Nice & easy! Thanks :)
