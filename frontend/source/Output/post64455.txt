Is the "Cellar" folder only used for Homebrew? <body> So if I am not using Homebrew, I can safely remove it?  <answer64476> The script for uninstalling Homebrew removes it completely, so it's probably safe to remove it.  https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/FAQ     h3How do I uninstall Homebrew?/h3      If you installed to code/usr/local/code then you can use the script in this gist to uninstall — it will only remove Homebrew and the stuff Homebrew installed leaving anything else in /usr/local alone.      Provided you haven’t put anything else in Homebrew’s prefix (codebrew --prefix/code), you can generally just coderm -rf/code that directory. This is because Homebrew won’t touch files outside its prefix.   <answer106991> Yes. You can remove Cellar directory.  <comment75816> From one of the comments, I was hesitated...The FAQ says that this gist uninstalls ONLY the homebrew stuff. The FAQ says that Cellar is the place to install non-homebrew stuff. This gist removes Cellar. <comment76880> @Yoga If you look closely, the FAQ says "it will only remove Homebrew **and the stuff Homebrew installed**". The homebrew homepage says "Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local." Check this [useful article](http://hivelogic.com/articles/using_usr_local/) about using `usr/local` by Dan Benjamin of 5by5. <comment76915> @myhd - that article is not that useful - FHS is Linux and not Unix, /usr/local is for stuff you compiled yourslef but many unicies also have /opt (as also does Macports) and other directories that are not affected by system installs <comment77067> Still, it is very common for `./configure` with no `--prefix=` argument to just assume you want to install in /usr/local; and the Homebrew FAQ does suggest installing stuff you've compiled yourself there, and then using `brew link` on it. <comment105456> To clarify: The "Cellar" directory is a location that Homebrew made up for its own use. (The name fits with Homebrew's "beer" theme: the "cellar" is where you store your "kegs" of "homebrew".) No other software uses it. So if you don't need Homebrew *and the programs you installed using Homebrew*, you can delete Cellar. @myhd - when homebrew says "to their own directory", that "own directory" is located under "Cellar".
