Linux Mint VirtualBox guest mouse coordinates not aligned with OS X host mouse coordinates <body> With VirtualBox guest additions installed (both at 5.1.24 r117012 (Qt5.6.2)), emInput  Mouse Integration/em enabled, my Linux Mint 17 Cinnamon 64-bit guest mouse coordinates are not aligned with my OS X 10.12.5 host mouse coordinates.  The guest pointer is positioned to the bottom-right of the host pointer, i.e. I have to use the tail of the cursor's arrow to select anything.   The cursor changes color from the OS X black arrow to the Mint/Cinnamon white arrow when I move from host to guest because of the mouse integration, but the arrow doesn't jump to a different offset. It just isn't align correctly with the tip of the arrowhead when I select anything.  I've restarted guest and restarted host (in that order and in reverse order). I've dealt with this issue across two VirtualBox (and guest additions) update release installations, but the problem persists.  No idea what else to try... suggestions?
