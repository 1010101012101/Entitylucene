MacBook Pro Calendar events not displaying <body> When I enter a calendar event in my MacBook Pro Calendar, it does not display in my calendar.  I tried looking in the day, week and month views, but it is not displaying.  Oddly, if I do a search for the item, it displays in the search list as being present, however, it won't let me open it, but it does jump to the day /week/month of the event.  If I right-click “Get Info”, it opens an info window with the proper details. And it lets me right click and duplicate it.   Also, it DOES properly sync via iCloud to my iPhone, and it displays properly on my iPhone.  Comments and suggestions please.  <comment346207> I wonder if you could post screen shots of some of the symptoms?
