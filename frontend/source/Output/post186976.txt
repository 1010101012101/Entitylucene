Outlook for Mac 15.9 missing ribbon <body> I have installed a fresh copy of Outlook for Mac v15.9 twice now and after a few days of use the ribbon disappears from all of the windows (main window, email window, etc). When I select View  Ribbon in hopes that it will turn it back on, nothing happens.  How can I get this crazy ribbon back so I am no longer using the menu to send and reply to emails?  <answer187642> I've had the same problem using the 2015 Outlook preview on a Mac.  Quitting (using the shift alt delete equivalent) and restarting the programme gets the ribbon back every time for me.  <answer187853> Confirmed, quitting the application (File -- Quit) and restarting brings back the ribbon.  Annoying.  <comment222177> You should have added your "Confirmation" as a Comment to the question, and not as an Answer
