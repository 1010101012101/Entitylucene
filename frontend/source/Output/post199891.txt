Headphones with iPhone 6 protection case <body> I have a small protection case around my iPhone 6 and my headphones can't be plugged perfectly. Anybody knows a very thin case to protect my iPhone without having this issue?  <answer199893> Probably be cheaper to borrow a needle file &amp; ream out the cover's headphone hole a bit;br or even a simple nail-file &amp; chamfer the edge of the headphone plug itself.
