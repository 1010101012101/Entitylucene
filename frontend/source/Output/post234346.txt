Why doesn't my wireless mouse connect automatically? <body> Every time I want to use my wireless mouse (Apple Magic Mouse) with my Macbook Pro, I need to plug in a USB mouse and "Connect" the mouse manually via the bluetooth menubar widget. Is there anything I can do to make this happen automatically?  <answer234378> If you've paired it before, clicking the mouse after turning it on should do it.  <comment288211> I hadn't tried this until just now - I think a small part of me just didn't believe it could possibly be that simple. Thanks :-) <comment288212> Glad I could help! Isn't Apple great like that? <comment288213> Well ... it's simple, but it's not very discoverable. I guess I just expected it to work - after all, the green light on my mouse is flashing. I assumed that was a "trying to connect" signal - who would've thought it needed an extra 'kick' to get things going? Not me, obviously!
