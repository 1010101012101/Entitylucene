Copy Photos from Ipad to windows 7 <body> codeSub: The easiest way to access the photos from Ipad to Windows PC./code  I got a ipad from my sister. I like to copy the photos from it to pc. I am using windows 7. I failed trying with iCloud, iTunes, Photo Sharing and so on.   What is the simplest way to copy the data? Do I want to adjust the setting in iPad? My iPad model is MD513X/A and version 7.1.  I had tried the steps in the links "http://blog.laptopmag.com/how-to-quickly-transfer-images-from-an-ipad-to-a-pc". But the ipad is not shown in the My Computer.    <comment184630> Have you tried the suggestions on http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201302 ? <comment184633> Can you please be a bit more specific and explain what you actually tried already and how this failed? Did you try the methods described in the Apple support document linked above? <comment184634> Also please have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9277/how-can-one-copy-photos-off-an-ipad-onto-a-windows-computer-prior-to-syncing?rq=1 <comment184642> @patrix I had checked down the link.
