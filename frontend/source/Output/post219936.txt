Yosemite: Power nap gets re-enabled <body> I'm trying to figure out how to disable the Power Nap feature. I have the checkbox disabled in "Energy Saver" preferences, but I can see for sure that it's indeed enabled by running a CPU intensive program in background. If I switch to other apps, that program is paused.   But if I exit all programs, go to Power Nap settings check and then uncheck the checkbox, then everything works as expected. Then everything happens again after some period of time  <comment265998> Power nap is when your Mac does stuff even in sleep mode. App nap is when your apps "pause" if you don't use them (IIRC for a minute). Could you clarify which you mean? I can't check right now as I'm on mobile. <comment266153> Oh, it looks like I misunderstood the setting! Thanks @Arc676. If you want, post a reply and I'll accept it <comment266154> It's still weird that playing with Power Nap option affected 'App Nap' behavior though
