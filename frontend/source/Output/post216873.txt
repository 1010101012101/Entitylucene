Disappearing and reverting events in Calendar <body> Calendar on OS X, which has always had trouble with disappearing events, is now waiting several minutes to perform its disapparation magic, so I an enter an appointment, wait a while to confirm that it stuck (a habit I've learned is essential over the years), be emsure/em it’s safely recorded, and even then; poof! — it’s gone (or turned into a generic “New Event”).   I simply can’t rely on Calendar for anything any more!  Is there a way to configure Calendar so that appointments that I enter don't disappear or revert in this way?  <comment262159> Is it trying to sync to iCloud & failing? Poor connectivity, dodgy Wifi etc? It just has all the feel of 'server lag', dropped packets, high latency etc. If that is even vaguely a possibility, test with no internet connection & see if it holds until you do connect [or even if that fixes it entirely]. Even if inconvenient, it might be pointing the way. <comment262160> I don't think so. If so the issue isn't on my side. I have fast reliable network connectivity. It does feel line a sync issue, but the problem seems to be on the Apple end of things. I've logged out and back in again, and this has persisted across several OS X upgrades (and one machine transfer). <comment262162> Though unrelated to iCloud; I work helpline for an online gaming structure… where the opening 'fix' for anything that feels network-related is "Reboot your puter & all networking hardware & try again" By heck it's trite, I know, but the number of times it actually works… <comment262163> I've done that several times. It has no effect (nor do updates, killing processes, or even machine transfers). <comment262165> I had a feeling you would have done that, over such a long time period. I'm out of ideas, sorry.. but it still 'feels' like network latency <comment262168> @Tetsujin: Could firewall be involved? <comment262169> Possibly. I'd be tempted to bypass the whole lot for a test & try a Starbucks. Unless it's a Mac Pro, of course ;-) <comment262426> @Tetsujin: Starbucks is no better. And I can confirm that at least in one case (there could be many others undiscovered) the reversion happened after more than an hour (perhaps days) and — weirdly — if I try to change it to what it should be, I get a suggested edit that corresponds to what it was, but if I choose that, I'm unable to apply it!
