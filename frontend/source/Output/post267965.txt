Macbook pro 2015 logon problem( black screen with cursor) <body> strongEvery time my battery dies/strong, when I turn it on, after putting the password the screen goes black and the only thing appeared ,is my cursor. None response.  strongI found a solution for the black screen/strong I have to put my password and click enter but it is annoying that every time I have go through that.   Does anyone know what to do to fix that ?  thanks in advance    emmy macbook is running macOS Sierra v 10.12.2/em  <comment336309> Hold down the power button for ~1 minute, release, hold it down again for ~1 minute. This will reboot your Mac and should fix the issue (does with me).
