Early 2008 iMac 24-inch shuts down unexpectedly <body> Does anyone know what can be causing my 2008 iMac 24-inch to shut down unexpectedly? I can only use it for a short moment, perhaps 20-30 minutes and it shuts down and the screen turns dark gray? It seems like it may be still running? I have to hold the power button to shut it off entirely.  Then it will not restart until I leave it for a while.  The screen seems to get pretty hot in such short time too?  Is there anything I can replace to start?  Apple Genius Bar could not load up their hardware boot up to check the computer.  They said I need it to replace it; too old? Any help is much appreciated. Thank you Enrique  <comment333301> You really need to provide us more info. For example: 1. What version of macOS are you running? 2. How much RAM do you have? 3. How much free disk space do you have? 4. Is it shutting down regardless of what you're doing, or only when you're doing certain tasks? <comment333324> From your description it sounds likely that you have a hardware error. Boot up the iMac holding down the "d"-key on the keyboard to boot into Apple's hardware diagnostics tool. It could be for example that your RAM is defective. One of the likely problems is that your fan is failing or completely stopped working - that could make the iMac hot and it would shut down automatically when the temperature is too high.
