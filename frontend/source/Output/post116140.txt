What is daemon user on mac? <body> I installed XAMPP on mac and it uses the user daemon. I have trouble accessing an external site that I have setup for which I am getting "Access Denied" error.br This is likely because daemon user does not have access to this folder. I can't see this user among user users. I have looked everywhere.br Where I can access/change permission to this user?  I came to know about Daemons and Agents on mac. Are they related?br How would I add this user to directory. Because when I click get info a folder, this user (daemon) is not listed.  <answer162331> Ref : XAMPP on Mac OSX: Why running as 'daemon'?  In em/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/etc/httpd.conf/em change  precodeUser daemon Group daemon /code/pre  to  precodeUser YourName Group YourGroup /code/pre  Fixed!  <comment135884> Why not grant the user permission on the files in question? Also, what does the installation guide for XAMPP recommend for your version of the software? <comment135885> It uses XAMPP user. It does not have any particular recommendation. I can probably run XAMPP under my own administrator login but I want to know how to set permission for this deamon user and what actually it is. <comment135886> You say "accessing an external site " because "does not have access to this folder" How is an external site a folder? <comment135891> External site outside XAMPP's htdocs folder. By default pages are severed from htdocs but you can setup external folders that serves pages as well. External folder: Any folder other than htdoc folder.
