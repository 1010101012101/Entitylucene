Calendar open file while sleep <body> I have a calendar event set to open an application at an early time. However during this time, my Mac is at sleep. Will the calendar wake the Mac to open the application? If not, how can I make it so that it will do that?  <answer239909> OS X's Calendar.app will not wake a sleeping Mac to open your file.  There are three ways to have your Mac wake up at the appropriate time:  ol liYou can use OS X's built-in Energy Saver settings to schedule your Mac to wake  up. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xrNU.png" alt="Energy Saver settings in OS X&#39;s System Preferences"/li liYou can use codepmset/code on the command line to schedule more events./li liYou can use a third party tool like Power Manager to schedule more sophisticated sequences of wake and power-on events./li /ol  Disclosure: I am an engineer who works on Power Manager; so feel free to ask technical questions.  <comment294839> What if the display is just turned off and you force the computer not to sleep? <comment294870> If the display is turned off and your Mac is not sleeping, then Calendar.app will open the file. <comment294900> And OSX did something Trollish to me. I set the app to open an early time and when I came later in the morning, it got stuck on "do you want to open this app for the first time?" RAGE! The apps I want to open are applescript apps I made. How do i make apple not have this warning? <comment294908> Understandably annoying. Please can you [ask a new question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) to find work arounds for this behaviour. Hopefully that will attract helpful answers.
