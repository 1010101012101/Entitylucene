Mac app for automatically closing / opening certain apps according to profiles? <body> I am looking for a app that allows me to set profiles consisting of apps to close or open on profile change.   Example. The following processes are currently open  ul liDropbox/li liChrome/li liFoo/li liBar/li /ul  After activating "cafe profile"   ul liChrome/li liBar/li liTerminal/li /ul  Background: I work in cafes a lot. Most of the times, I forget to turn off dropbox, hangouts, and other background processes which drains battery. Upon realizing, I close everything from the process manager, but if I had a app which does that automatically, that would save me a lot of time.   I plan to write it myself but want to make sure it doesn't exist yet before doing doubled work.   <answer180324> If you are willing to pay some money for it there is the excellent Keyboard Maestro which can do a lot of things. There you can close and open Apps easily.  If you do not want to spend money I suggest you take some time to learn Apple Script. This is a free scripting language provided by Apple. Alternatively you can use shell scripts but I am not so sure if you can easily check which apps are running or not.  <answer180333> Sounds like ControlPlane might be the app you're looking for.  With this utility you can define different contexts based on various criteria (i.e. Wi-Fi name, attached peripherals), and execute tasks upon entering or leaving these contexts.  <comment214327> This is exactly what I was looking for!
