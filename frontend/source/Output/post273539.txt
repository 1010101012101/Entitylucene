MacBook Air shows blank screen when returning from sleep <body> I have this recurrent problem where upon returning from sleep, my Mid-2013 13" MacBook Air (running OSX 10.9.5) will show a blank screen with a responsive mouse cursor. Trying to switch desktops using the trackpad will usually cause the screen to show an image for a very short period (about 0.5 seconds). codepmset -g | grep hibernatemode/codeshows code3/code, which I believe is normal for laptops. I can fix it by either rebooting or waiting around, which doesn't always work.  Anyone had this issue?
