Homebrew recipe without url <body> Is it possible to create a Homebrew Formula that doesn't need a URL to download?  In my case the recipe just depends on other recipes and installs a homebrew specific shell script.  precodeclass Test &lt; Formula   desc "Test"   homepage "https://test.com"   version "1.0"    depends_on "yschimke/tap/oksocial"    def install     (bin+"testoksocial").write &lt;&lt;-EOS.undent         #!/bin/sh          echo Hello     EOS   end end /code/pre  But running this gives  precode$ brew install ./test.rb Error: formulae require at least a URL Please report this bug:     https://git.io/brew-troubleshooting /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/formula.rb:193:in `determine_active_spec' /code/pre  <answer243882> I got it working by creating an empty tar file and linking to that.  But I'm curious if there are better ways.  precode$ tar cvf empty.tar --files-from /dev/null /code/pre  <comment300405> brew is a package manager. What is it you're actually wanting your formula to do? <comment300406> Install a command (shell script), that has dependencies on other homebrew targets.  I can put the scripts in the tarball, but if I need to rewrite them during installation e.g. based on optional dependencies then the archive seems pointless given the recipe can write out the command. <comment300407> That might "work" but I'm not sure if the brew developers would accept that formula if you submitted it to them. Probably better asking on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues) rather than on Ask Different. <comment300410> It's for a private tap, not something I intend for the public repo.  Internal company tools etc.
