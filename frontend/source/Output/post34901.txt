Is there software for transcribing and recognizing musical pitches in an audio recording? <body> Does GarageBand or any other Mac software make it possible to determine the notes in a musical recording?  It doesn't have to be absolute, and it doesn't even have to guess the rhythm. Determining the intervals would be enough.  <answer34905> No, GarageBand cannot do this. You should investigate the commercial products Celemony Melodyne and Neuratron AudioScore.  Also have a look at Capo by SuperMegaUltraGroovy. It provides a good method for assisting a person in transcribing by ear.  <answer34909> No.  Not in the general case.  This still seems to be a research problem.  One of those areas where commonly available software hasn't (yet?) caught up with musically talented small children.  MIREX holds an annual contest.
