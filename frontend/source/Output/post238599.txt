Not getting to Web Inspector in Safari 9 <body> [OS X 10.11, Safari 9.1]  When I enable the developer tools and select strongShow Web Inspector/strong from the strongDevelop/strong menu I don't see anything at all like the Web Inspectors shown in Apple documentation and various web pages I found by search.  Can someone explain my problem and how to solve it?

And yes, the coloring is just for illustrative purposes in the documentation.  On your own screenshot, you can click the "+" button to the next of the Elements tab to gain access to the extra stuff you see in the documentation - for example Debugger, Timelines, Storage, Network, etc.  <comment292991> Aha. Thank you. <comment293182> If this solved your problem, please mark it as answered. I assume it did?
