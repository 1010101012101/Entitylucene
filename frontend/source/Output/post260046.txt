earlier logs in Console of Sierra <body> After a complete freeze and hard reboot on my Mac Pro, I try to find out why.  In Console “Devices” I only see the logs of the last few minutes.   How can I see earlier logs? The only control I can see is a “Now” button.  OK, looks like “Diagnostic and Usage Data” is more helpful. There I see also previous logs.  But what about “Devices”? Are there only logs from the current system start on?  <comment325469> Devices is mostly about "other" devices, like remote iPhones.
