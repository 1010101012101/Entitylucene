No shared Links available in iOS 7 Safari <body> New with iOS 7 is a "Shared Links" tab in Safari. I have twitter accounts setup on my device (TweetBot shows them). However I don't see any content in the Shared Links tab. Just this message:     No Shared Links      Links shared by your contacts from select social networks will appear   here.   How do I link my twitter account in Safari so that content appears here?  <answer102256> Go to strongSettings  Twitter/strong and link your account there. Once installed, and linked, if you open the codeBookmarks/code tab in Safari, you will see codeBookmarks/code, the codeReading List/code, and codeShared Links/code. If you have logged in properly, your Shared Links will appear here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kJZ2e.png" alt="Shared Links screenshot"  <answer104199> Yeah, logout of twitter and back in again in your settings.  <answer106200> I had the same problem; the update wiped out many passwords, and this is what's causing minor problems.  To get Twitter to work on Safari 7, go to strongSystem Preferences  Internet Accounts  [your Twitter account]/strong. The account should be there as one of your accounts, and your password is likely gone - just retype it and save. Give Safari a few seconds to catch on the password exists again, and the shared links should go live in a matter of a few seconds.  <comment120896> Thanks. I already had my account setup, however after restoring from iCloud I had to recreate my account for this to work.
