Bootable USB wrote over my main partition and 'Copy of OS X El Capitan could not be verified' problem <body> I recently downloaded El Capitan from an unverified torrent source and made a bootable USB.  Now my MacBook (2009) has 2 partitions, the main one (named untitled), running Snow Leopard and another to try out other os (named untitled 2, currently has Mountain Lion). I was going to install El Capitan on a third partition (named El Capitan) but after making the bootable USB I restarted the Mac and the USB automatically wrote over my main partition running Snow Leopard. I had all my unbacked data in it. Anyways, I tried to go ahead with the installation but it showed me the error "Copy of OS X El Capitan could not be verified". Now I'm stuck without any of my data, and only 1 partition with Mountain Lion.  And oh, the original partition, is named Install OS X El Capitan.  This is a shot in the dark, but is there any way I could salvage any of my data or move forward with the installation?  <comment363300> I don't even know where to begin with this unorthodox setup of having SL, ML and EC all on one computer (what's the benefit?), downloading EC from a torrent when Apple makes the genuine thing available to you or doing all this without a backup,  so I will start at the end and recommend that if you want any decent chance of salvaging your data, 1) stop using the drive immediately, and 2) using a **different** computer, hook your drive up via USB and use a utility like [DiskDrill](https://www.cleverfiles.com/) to attempt a recovery.  Short of that, you're starting from scratch.
