Find which songs failed to sync <body> I've got about 6000 songs in my iTunes library.  I just got a new iPhone and after synching I found that there were about 60 fewer songs on it than there was in my library.  However I didn't get any warning messages.    Is there a way to determine the difference between my iTunes library and the library on my iPhone?    I have an iPhone 5s with iOS 7.0.3 and Lion on the computer with iTunes 11.1.2
