Snow Leopard wont load on Mac <body> My 13" Macbook Pro running 10.6.8 recently crashed and would not start due to Google Drive malfunctioning.   I uninstalled Drive and my computer still wouldnt load properly so I did a clean install from the Snow Leopard disc.   It now loads the welcome screen, plays the intro with the music then freezes when I try to choose my language.   Does anyone have any suggestions as to what may be the issue? Im wondering if I should change the hard drive, but when I use Disc Utility to repair the drive, it says there is no issues.   <comment157775> try starting in Safe mode or single user mode. <comment157777> Safe mode wont work, it gives blue or gray screen. Single user mode works and I successfully did fsck -fy, but it still freezes <comment157784> If safe does not work probably your installation was not correct. Just to verify, you are sure about the os versions.
