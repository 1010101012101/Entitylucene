How to change a table cell from $ to â‚¬ in Pages? <body> I'm using Pages' Invoice templates, and it's been grand so far. Now I need to send an invoice to Europe, and the sums need to be in euros rather than dollars. How can I change the currency type in the table?  <answer71021> Use the inspector to change the table cell formatting symbol.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5dQd7.png" alt="Pages Cell Format inspector view"  <comment82451> And as soon as I ask, I think to check the obvious place. Right. In the Inspector, under Table/Format. Right, then. <comment82454> I recommend making that an answer, and accepting it when it allows you to. It might benefit others in the future. <comment82465> Yes please - make an answer - we encourage "jeopardy" questions as long as the answer goes in the answer section and not in the comments or the question. <comment82490> Yup. As a new user it wouldn't let me answer my own question until it had timed out. <comment82498> Grrr - I've got plenty of rep - so why don't you answer it yourself and send a comment on mine once you can accept your answer. I wanted people to see the answer in the mean time, but would rather you get credit for this once the timeouts pass. <comment82529> No worries. Your answer includes a handy picture. Keep the rep. I'd have upvoted your answer, too. But again, new user.
