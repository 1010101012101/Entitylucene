Terminator for Mac OSX <body> I'm using Ubuntu on a daily basis, and recently (6 months ago) I bought a Mac, so the first thing I did was installing VMWare and Ubuntu on my MBP. Also I'm a developper and I was a huge fan of Terminator (https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/terminator/) , you can open multiple file in one window, and code separatly on them, and many other great things .. I thought that if it runs on Ubuntu it could possibly run on Mac OSX but it seemes that it does'nt work .. Can you give me Terminator-like terminal for Mac OSX Yosemite ?  Thanks !   <answer156155> Use iTerm2. Can do most things that Terminator does.  <answer156168> Did you try to do run Terminator with Fink:     To install Terminator on Mac OS X you will need to be using   the Fink project, and have it configured to allow unstable software.   With those requirements satisfied, in a terminal run: fink install   terminator   http://gnometerminator.blogspot.no/p/introduction.html  Although iTerm2 works great for me (although I prefer Yakuake for terminal on Linux)  <answer178492> There is hope in brew too:  precode$ brew search terminator homebrew/x11/terminator /code/pre  Here I would like to say too that, agreed ITerm2 is great but there might be use cases where terminator ... I mean the same terminator on Linux would shine such as better keyboard mappings for codeemacs/code out of the box or similar.  <answer227119> The gnometerminator docs are slightly outdated. Fink is now in stable, but must be installed from source on OSX 10.11.  http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/terminator?rel_id=10.11-x86_64-current-stable  <comment183672> +1 for iTerm2 - it's currently best terminal emulator for mac imho. And it can do almost - if not all - that Terminator does. <comment183679> There are not so many choices for terminal emulators on OS X... <comment183681> Yeah a prefer the basic solution, and it works great, all I wanted to do was splitting the window :) <comment250132> There are several choices for terminals. No emulators required! <comment276054> iTerm is extremely slow comparing to other terminals, like macTerm. <comment297370> unfortunately the terminator ui is bit-ugly on OS X. I guess Thats because the pygtk stuff that powers the UI is not themed well for OS X.
