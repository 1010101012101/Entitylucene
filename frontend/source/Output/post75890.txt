Issues with auto brightness on iOS6 <body> I recently purchased an iPad 4 with iOS 6.0.1. I seem to have issues with the auto brightness feature.  While the slider (in the settings screen) moves rightward rapidly on moving to an area of greater brightness, the reverse happens really slowly, sometimes not at all.  Wanted to know if anyone else is having this issue, and what is the fix, if there is one?
