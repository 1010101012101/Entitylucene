@me.com mail server settings for Windows Live Mail 2012 on Windows 10 <body> It used to work now it doesn't! I have windows 10 Enterprise. I have Windows Live Mail 2012. I have ....@me.com Apple account. I want to get my @me.com emails in WLM as I was able to before whatever they have changed: Microsoft or Apple! It should be simple:IMAP incoming outgoing server addresses; server port numbers; SSL; username, password; authentication type; I tried each and every combination suggested by Apple And Microsoft official websites! I also tried every other unofficial suggestions! Does this mean there are no workarounds anymore for this problem? Am I to assume that I can't get my @me.com emails on my WLM?   <comment345646> This appears to be an issue with the @me.com service or with Win10 support for me.com - both of which are outside the scope of Ask Different.  Have you tried contacting [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/)?  Also, W10 Ent. means it's probably managed by an IT staff - did you check with them to see if they turned off IMAP support? <comment345648> Ways to access @me.com are on-topics, ways to configure WLM are probably better suited for SuperUser. Can you clarify your problem to make it more clear whether we keep the question here or move it over to SU? <comment346644> I am unable to receive my emails from @me.com account into Windows Live Mail program! What is unclear about this? on the 1st of march I was able to get my emails and from next day on I cant get them! Eventhough I havent changed any IMAP and SMTP server settings! That's why I said either Microsoft or Apple must have changed their settings that's why I cant get them! I checked both Microsoft and Apple websites for all kinds of server settings suggestions. None of them worked! So that's why I'm here asking you guys! Arent you "answers for your apple questions"? and this is an apple question!
