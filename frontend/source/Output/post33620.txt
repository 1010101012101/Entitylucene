Does this Mini DisplayPort to HDMI connector output audio? <body> I'm trying to find a relatively cheap strongMini DisplayPort to HDMI/strong cable that also supports sending audio to an HDTV. Cables from Monoprice are out of the question, since they don't ship to Romania and I'd rather not spend $40 for a cable sold by an Apple authorized reseller.  I've found several cables on eBaysup1/sup that say they support "emDTS/DTS-HD, Dolby Digital / Dolby TrueHD, and Linear PCM (LPCM)/em". All those acronyms leave me completely clueless; they all have something to do with audio, but none of them clearly state "yes, we have audio support". Would such a cable allow me to output both video and audio to a strongmid-2010 MacBook Pro/strong? Has anyone actually purchased such a cable and had any problems with it?  sup1. I haven't linked to any of the cables I've found on eBay since I'm not here to drive traffic to their products. Also, I'm trying not to spam this site./sup  <answer33625> The Original Apple-Adapter supports Audio for MacBook Pro and iMac Mid2010  From the Apple-Website:     Note: *Audio support is only available for MacBook Pro 13/15/17-in.   mid-2010 release; iMac 21.5/27-in. early-2010 release   Apple-Store Link  I've bought a cheap one from Belkin for my MacBook Air - but there is no Audio-Output!  <answer37999> I ordered a cheap Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable from eBay (less than $5, including transport) and it works perfectly, including sound.  The only thing needed is to configure the audio output source to TV instead of the internal speakers (you only need to do this once; after that, it will remember the setting and switch automatically once connected to the TV). To change the audio source, option click on the speaker icon on the menu bar, go to the Output tab and choose your TV.  <answer38028> Some of the 2010 and later Mac laptops and iMacs have support for audio over the DisplayPort, which would work with DisplayPort to HDMI.  Otherwise, only the video comes through.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4241  If you don't have audio over DisplayPort, get this cable: http://www.amazon.com/Kanex-iAdapt-DisplayPort-Channel-Digital/dp/B0031QH1BG/ref=sr_1_19?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327331080&amp;sr=1-19  I've used it many times with my 2009 MacBook Pro.  It uses the laptop's optical out to provide the audio, and presents the audio &amp; video to an HDMI cable connector.  <answer189441> I've had an issue where strongsometimes/strong the Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter would transmit sound to the TV, and sometimes not. It was driving me crazy, but I think I finally figured it out.  If I loaded the webpage BEFORE I had plugged in the adapter, then the sound for the streaming video would only play on the Macbook speakers.  After having been plugged in, when I strongemrefreshed the page/em/strong, and "refetched" the content to stream, then it played audio from the TV.  Quick fix that worked for me, so it might be worth a try.  strongemNote:/strong I have a 2013 Macbook Air with Yosemite, and a Rocketfish adapter (RF-AP305)./em  <comment38392> I'm more interested in the cheapo cables that you find on eBay. They mention a lot of stuff about audio (Dolby, DTS, LPCM), but I'd really want someone to confirm if they have audio out... <comment89612> Alex, which Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable did you purchase? I am looking for the same thing to connect to my late 2009 Macbook Pro an HDtv <comment89931> @Kamrun Cheapest one I could find off of eBay. It works just as well as an original adapter, but for a fraction of the cost. As I said in my answer, it cost less than $5, including shipping. <comment92083> I got a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable fro Amazon; customer comments there said it worked for audio, but for my 2011 MBA, I get no audio to my LG TV HDMI input (I tried several different input HDMI ports on the TV). Video works fine. The OS X Sound applet shows the LG TV for sound output (HDMI) is selected, but says "The selected device has no output controls". How did you get audio to work? <comment140019> I have this same issue @djb. I have no solution either. My mac is a mid-2012 MBA and the tv definitely support audio over HDMI. It seems the product page for this belkin adapter is just lieing. <comment140216> @DragonFax Sometimes I get audio, sometimes not. I don't know why.
