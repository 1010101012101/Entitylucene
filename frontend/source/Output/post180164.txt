Cmd + PgUp/Down shortcut to navigate through terminal tabs <body> is it possible to make kbdCmd/kbd+kbdPage Up/kbd / kbdPage Down/kbd shortcut performing switch tab in Terminal?  At the moment I can use kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd[/kbd or kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd]/kbd shortcuts to do the thing, but this is horrible for me. I'm using external USB Keyboard and Karabiner, if that may help somehow.  <answer180167> You can use codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts &gt; Application Shortcuts/code to configure custom shortcuts for anything available in the menus of an application.  Just choose the application from the list or codeOther.../code to select an application not in the list (or leave it at codeAll Applications/code for every application), type in the exact menu text and supply a keyboard shortcut.  <answer180224> strongUpdate/strong:br The answer now reassigns emScroll to Top/Bottom/em to kbd⌥⌘PageUp/kbd and kbd⌥⌘PageDown/kbd.br This leaves emShow Previous/Next Tab/em free to take over kbd⌘PageUp/kbd and kbd⌘PageDown/kbd.  hr  Assuming your OS X runs in English, you can use this one-liner:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Scroll to Top' '~@\Uf72c' 'Scroll to Bottom' '~@\Uf72d' 'Show Previous Tab' '@\Uf72c' 'Show Next Tab' '@\Uf72d' /code/pre  If your OS X runs in a language other than English, modify the command to resemble the exact menu item text for your language.  <comment287502> Even though you are generally right about configuring shortcuts this way - it appears impossible to utilize `Page Up` or `Page Down` (or `End`, `Home`) this way, which is what the question was about specifically. <comment287504> seen this answer somewhere else with slight variations, but it doesn't appear to work - could you please confirm that this should still work today? <comment287508> I was aware what the OP wanted. The only thing I was not aware of was that Page Up/Down was not possible as I saw that I used these keys as shortcuts on my computer somewhere. It may have been in a 3rd party application then where I used it. <comment287514> To be honest - there is no good reason in my opinion why it can't be used there and I would expect to be able to configure it exactly as you suggest, but for some unknown reason Apple doesn't allow us to do that. <comment287681> @Chris Turns out the answer broke due to conflicting shortcuts. I have fixed the answer and can confirm it works for me now.
