How do I get iTunes to play all music from a specific year? <body> How do I select and then play all songs from release year?  e.g. Play all music from 1969.  Even better, play all rock genre music from 1969.  <answer178727> Use a Smart Playlist. These are playlists that are dynamic and can be built off filters on track metadata.  To create a new Smart Playlist select codeFile &gt; New &gt; Smart Playlist.../code (or Opt-Cmd-N) and then set the following options to build a Smart Playlist that always contains all the tracks that are from 1969 in your library:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQpsP.png" alt="A Smart Playlist for 1969"  If you wanted to limit it to a specific emgenre/em from 1696 press the kbd+/kbd button to add another filter criteria and pick a genre like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Dtdu.png" alt="A Smart Playlist for Rock from 1969"  You can filter in all kinds of ways -- Smart Playlists are incredibly powerful.  <comment211993> Thank you Ian!!  That is EXACTLY what I was looking for!  And I like the fact I can exclude genres (e.g. "Holiday" and "New Age") when I want to listen to Rock, etc. from 1969!  This is perfect! <comment212008> @newawryzen no problem.
