Mac OS X, 10.12.2, Command Line how to add Search Domains <body> I do this all the time with the GUI and it does what I am looking for. No Problem.  strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongNetwork/strong  Select the strongLAN/strong or strongWi-Fi/strong  strongAdvanced/strong  strongDNS/strong  strongSearch Domains/strong and in that particular box field, I add all the search domains that I want. e.g. office, hq, ad.gwn, etc.  strongQuestion/strong, how can I achieve the same process via command line with Terminal?  So far this is what I did:  strongStep #1/strong I run both these command line to get an overview of what I have:  ul linetworksetup -listallnetworkservices/li linetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder/li /ul  and this is what I got:  ul liList item/li liApple USB Ethernet Adapter/li liThinkpad USB LAN/li liWi-Fi/li liBluetooth PAN/li liThunderbolt Bridge/li li(1) Apple USB Ethernet Adapter (Hardware Port: Apple USB Ethernet Adapter, Device: en4)/li li(2) Thinkpad USB LAN (Hardware Port: Thinkpad USB LAN, Device: en5)/li li(3) Wi-Fi (Hardware Port: Wi-Fi, Device: en0)/li li(4) Bluetooth PAN (Hardware Port: Bluetooth PAN, Device: en3)/li li(5) Thunderbolt Bridge (Hardware Port: Thunderbolt Bridge, Device: bridge0)/li /ul  Step #2 I tried to add my search domains (hq, office, ad.gwn) but I received the following error message:  - sudo networksetup -setsearchdomains en4 hq office ad.gwn  - en4 is not a recognized network service  - Error: The parameters were not valid  I am connected only with Ethernet cable. No WiFi.  I tried en4 and en5 same issue.  <answer268440> First list all network services to get an overview:  precodenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices /code/pre  Output example:  precodeAn asterisk (*) denotes that a network service is disabled. en0 en1 /code/pre  I renamed my two network services from "Ethernet" to en0 and "Ethernet Adapter (1)" to en1. You have to use strongyour/strong actual network service names of course! If the network service name contains spaces you have to use quotes (e.g. "Apple USB Ethernet Adapter") in the commands below.  To set search domains for a network service use:  precodesudo networksetup -setsearchdomains networkservice domain1 [domain2] [...] /code/pre  Example:  precodesudo networksetup -setsearchdomains en0 example.home example.net example /code/pre  Check with codenetworksetup -getsearchdomains en0/code:  precodeexample.home example.net example /code/pre  If you want to strongadd/strong search domains to already existing domains use:  precodeSEARCHDOMAIN=$(networksetup -getsearchdomains en0) sudo networksetup -setsearchdomains en0 $SEARCHDOMAIN domain1 domain2 ... /code/pre  <comment337178> Thanks. I did edit my post and I am almost done.  Just the final part I get an error message.  Any help?
