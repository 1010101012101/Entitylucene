Does restoring an iPhone from backup remove existing data from the iPhone? <body> I want to restore an old backup onto my iPhone. Will that delete the data currently on my iPhone, or does my data get added to what’s in the backup?  <answer288799> Restoring an iPhone from backup will wipe all its contents, then replace everything with what’s in the backup.  Whatever data is on your iPhone now, but not in the backup, will be strongGONE/strong after the restoration process.  <answer288812> When you restore your iPhone, whether it's from backup or as a "new" iPhone, all data on the phone since the last backup that was created will be erased (gone).   If you want to restore your iPhone from backup, the best thing to do is take a backup first using either iCloud backup or through iTunes, then perform the restore process.  Once the phone goes through the setup screen, you can restore from backup or start fresh.  <answer288822> When you recover your iPhone data by using iTunes backups, your current iPhone data will be synced with iTunes backup files. In order words, you can't simply add specific files onto iPhone with iTunes.    <comment364759> GONE needs more emphasis... :) <comment364805> So the data in my Iphone will be deleted after restoration process ? <comment364861> Yes, it will be deleted, and replaced by the backup.
