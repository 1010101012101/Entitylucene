Choosing between opening a file with primary or secondary program with a shortcut <body> I know how to change default program to certain type of files, but I've been running to situations where I could use 2 emdefaults/em.   Lets take em.html/em files for example. I have assigned Chrome to open all .html files on doubleclick, which is nice. As Im web developer, I usually need to open .html files also in textmate. For this to happen, I need to open context menu and select program from emOpen With/em menu.  Wouldn't it be great if one could kbdCommand/kbd+doubleclick to open that file with secondary program?   Is there a way to achieve this?  <answer66423> ol liOpen Automator and choose the service template/li liSet the input type to files or folders/li liAdd a run shell script action and choose to pass input as arguments/li liPaste this as the script and edit the list of applications:  precodeapplications="pdf Preview zip The Unarchiver"  for f in "$@"; do     basename=${f%/}     basename=${basename##*/}     ext=${basename##*.}     if [[ "$ext" == "$basename" ]]; then         app=     else             app=$(grep -m1 ^$ext' ' &lt;&lt;&lt; "$applications" | cut -d ' ' -f 2-)     fi     [[ -z "$app" ]] &amp;&amp; app=TextMate     open "$f" -a "$app" done /code/pre/li liAssing the service a shortcut in the keyboard preference pane/li /ol  There's a bug where the shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until the services menu has been shown once from the menu bar. Another bug is that services that receive folders or files as input aren't available when folders are selected in column view in Finder.  <comment78500> fits my needs perfectly, thanks!
