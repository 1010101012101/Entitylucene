Mac VM mysteriously running out of disk space <body> Running a Mac VM (El Capitain) for Zabbix. The Disk space goes down to nearly nothing over 2 days, so I far I have searched this, and various other websites, and tried the following:   ol li/private/.../swapFiles. The private folder space (found by right clicking on the folder and Get Info) is the same. I see the disk space shrinking but the folder is the same size, so I am assuming the swap file is NOT the problem. /li li~/Library/Caches : This folder also seems to be staying the same size, although the drive is shrinking/li liI tried to do a search for files greater than 1 GB, only result is XCode. I know this is wrong since the swapfile0 is 1.07 GB. So I am at a loss here. Goal was to see some file slowly increase. /li liUnder system preferences and software update, I disabled downloading anything from Apple. /li /ol  Despite these 4 things, I am at a loss for words. I see it shrinking and I cannot seem to locate the file that is doing this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   <comment369494> Have you tried the logs folder located at ~/Library/Logs ?
