Disable slow window animation on OS X El Capitan? <body> I've tried the answers suggested in this question: How to turn off all animations on OS X  But so far now luck.  When an application has been recently opened, I can switch to it without seeing the window animation. But when an application has not been opened recently, there is still a window animation as it opens.  I use alfred keyboard shortcuts to jump between applications. When I use a keyboard shortcut to jump to an application, not only is there a window animation, but it is in slow-motion (taking about 1-2 seconds to complete).   I am running OS X 10.11.3.  Any ideas I could try beyond this command I have already tried?  precodedefaults write -g NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool false /code/pre
