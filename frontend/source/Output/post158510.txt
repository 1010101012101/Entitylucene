Alfred Terminal / Shell Command does not work <body> In Alfred, if I type code&gt; ls/code must open iTerm2 with that command. Well, does not work for me.  In Application if I select Terminal instead of iTerm2, works.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qg4zD.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I select Application → Custom, it shows the applescript code you can see below and works.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/APMzS.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I select Application → Custom and modify the codetell application/code line replacing Terminal with iTerm, does not work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hYmjY.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I open Script Editor and type the following applescript code, does not work:  precodetell application "iTerm"     activate     do script "ls" end tell /code/pre  If I remove codedo script/code line open iTerm.  Any ideas of why codedo script/code line does not work with iTerm?  <answer158511> This is a working example that I derived from the example in https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/AppleScript  Check out the comment from stefan.v...@gmail.com  precodetell application "iTerm"     activate      try         set _session to current session of current terminal     on error         set _term to (make new terminal)         tell _term             launch session "Default"             set _session to current session         end tell     end try      tell _session         write text "ls"     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer158758> I'm sure there is a better way, but, from now, this is the only way that works for me:  precodetell application "iTerm"     activate     set the clipboard to q     delay 0.5     tell application "System Events" to tell (name of application processes whose frontmost is true) to keystroke "v" using command down     tell application "System Events" to tell (name of application processes whose frontmost is true) to keystroke return end tell /code/pre  <answer205942> From the Alfred blog post: "You can find some excellent iTerm integration AppleScripts for the older and newer versions of iTerm on Alfred user Stuart C Ryan's Custom iTerm Applescripts for Alfred Github page."
