OS X's "free" or "/proc/meminfo" equivalent <body> OS X lacks the "Linux-friendly" codefree/code or code/proc/meminfo/code.  What would be the most reliable and backwards-compatible way of extracting this info:  ul liCurrent free memory, in bytes/li /ul  Going back as far as possible in terms of OS versions, without requiring extensions like codeports/code, codebrew/code, etc.  <answer101496> The closest analogs to codefree/code and codecat /proc/meminfo/code might be codevm_stat/code and codels -l /var/vm/code but you also have the BSD tools like heap and Darwin tool codeallmemory/code to dig deeper into processes and libraries to determine how the overall virtual memory load is allocated to specific processes.
