Developer settings gone in iOS 9? <body> Yesterday I finally made the change from the iOS 9 developer Beta to the Public Beta. That happened after something (I think it was badly-handled CoreData, since I was trying it for the first time) in an app I was trying caused my phone do simply stop working. When I finally restarted it, the developer settings was gone. I thought that it might get fixed by updating my iOS, but nothing new happened. My iPhone still doesn't get developer clearance, so I can't use it with Xcode.  I tried searching the web for a good hour or so, and could find nothing that would actually help me: Nothing is recent enough to actually work on iOS 9/Xcode 7 (at least nothing I found). They either just don't work, or the path they use doesn't exist anymore.  Is that something particular about iOS 9, in which you have to go through some different path in order to make your iPhone developer, or is it a bug?
