Terminal.app ignores ~/.profile file settings <body> Terminal started to ignore codeprofile/code file settings, which I didn't change in a long time. How can I force Terminal to respect the file again? I tried to delete and recreate but it didn't help...  My setup is Lion 10.7.3, Terminal.app reports version 2.2.2 (303). code~/.profile/code file has following attributes: code-rw-r--r--@/code  <answer43528> Ok, what shell (bash, zsh, ...) are you using? Bash for instance reads .profile in absence of .bash_profile and .bash_login, though of you are NOT using bash as a login shell it will most likely go straight to .bashrc  A similar question was asked on this forum before, and pjmorse added this link:  http://hayne.net/MacDev/Notes/unixFAQ.html#shellStartup  which describes what files are read, and in what order, by a shell in OSX.  <comment49460> Can you show us the contents of your profile? Here's what my profile looks like: -rw-r--r--  1 martin  staff  48 Sep 14 23:59 .profile <comment49465> @Mart√≠n: Extended attributes for profile file are: com.apple.FinderInfo 32 and com.apple.TextEncoding 15. Dunno what it means. The content of the file has not changed and was working so far... <comment49467> Problem solved. The link you provided was really helpful. It turned out that `.bash_login` was executed instead of my `.profile` file. `.bash_login` was created as a result of Ruby Version Manger (rvm) installation on my machine.
