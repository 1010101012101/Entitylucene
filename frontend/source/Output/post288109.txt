Can an iPhone be used to scan for bluetooth devices (not just BLE)? <body> There are several free BLE scanning apps and they work well, but I want to scan for Bluetooth devices like other phones, not just BLE.  Is it possible either via an app or by creating some sort of ssh connection and running a tool like codehcitool/code?  <comment363788> The question as written is rather broad. Whether the $5 app solves your problem is best answered by the developer, the rest of the question seems to be more speculation than a question. Can you please add some focus? <comment364087> @patrix I just want to know if you can use an iPhone to scan for bluetooth devices. I have found a work around but I am still very curious. I deleted some outdated and perhaps unnecessary parts of the question, so maybe that helps?
