What command combo at terminal will output a list of directories with human-readable sizes? <body> I'd like to open Terminal.app and strongenter a command like:/strong  codemy-macbook-pro:~ my-username$ ls -lh/code  Instead of seeing the size of the folders in bytes that are in my current working directory, I'd like to see size of the folders, including all of their contents like so:  codedrwxr-xr-x  7 my-username  staff   100Gi Dec 20 19:38 my-huge-project-folder/code  codedrwxr-xr-x  3 my-username  staff   80Gi Dec 27 14:15 my-slightly-smaller-project-folder/code  Is there a command I can type that will yield similar output above?  <answer6596> In order to see a list of folders with sizes you can use the strongdu/strong command.  To make the sizes human readable use the strong-h/strong option  To make sum the size of child folders use the strong-s/strong option (may take some time to run depending on the contents).   precodedu -hs * /code/pre   Here is an (uninteresting) example of the output.  precode   0B   Desktop  632K   Documents  356K   Downloads   76M   Library    0B   Movies    0B   Music  4.0K   Pictures    0B   Public   40K   Sites /code/pre  <comment6892> @g you need more musicâ€¦ ;) <comment6897> @martin - Or a faster computer... I ran it on a dummy account because I got impatient waiting for the results on my account! <comment6948> That will only count files you have access to read. Add sudo for a true count, especially if you are measuring outside your home folder. <comment16294> I like to add -c (du -shc *) to get a nice total at the end too.
