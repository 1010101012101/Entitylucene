Status of Contact updates in macOS Contacts app <body> I opened my Contacts app on macOS Sierra on my MacBook Pro. I selected all of my Facebook contacts and dragged them into my iCloud contacts, so I could merge them. I had 334 contacts in the selected group according to the selection drag and drop handler.  My cursor went into the swirling rainbow circle, and is still continuing that way. I'm on a 300MBps internet connection and I'm using the top of the line 2017 MacBook Pro, so I can't understand why this is taking so long.  strongMy questions:/strong  ul liIs there any way for me to know how far it has progressed in pushing my Facebook contacts to iCloud?/li liIs it safe to kill this process?/li /ul  <comment363663> I finally had to kill it. It never completed. Now, is there a way I can tell how many were added?
