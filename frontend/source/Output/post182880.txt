Can I open a text file in Preview from the Terminal? <body> I know that I can open a file with an external program from the Terminal with codeopen/code, and that works for most applications. However, when I try to use a command like codeopen -a Preview info.txt/code, it launches Preview, but the file is not opened.  I am on Mavericks 10.10.2.  Is there a way to use the codeopen/code command (or any other built-in command) to actually emopen/em a file in Preview from the Terminal?  <answer182882> Preview only works with PDF files and some image files (png, jpg, gif, tiff, bmp) so you won't be able to open a text file on Preview.  To open your info.txt file from terminal you need to choose an application that can open text files, like TextEdit or any other text editor.  You also could use codeopen -e file/code, to open any file using TextEdit.  <answer263758>    strongNB/strong - If there are   any further questions about this answer please comment.   strongUPDATE/strong  There's nothing wrong with the other answers, this one leverages a system command to convert the text file to a compatible filetype for Preview (i.e. PDF).   Given a sample file  you can run:  codecupsfilter info.txt &gt; info.pdf/code   (to hide the debug output use codecupsfilter info.txt &gt; info.pdf 2&gt; /dev/null/code)  After which one may apply the original answer to open the new codeinfo.pdf/code file in Preview. You can learn more by running codeman cupsfilter/code. I believe this just exposes the basic Save As PDF functionality that exists in the CUPS print system.   (Source)  strongAdditionally/strong  As noted in the comments one can simply pipe the command to open a file directly into Preview. This worked for me:  codecupsfilter info.txt 2&gt; /dev/null | open -f -a Preview/code  strong(Original Answer)/strong  To open a supported Preview file from Terminal, such as pdf, png, jpg, gif, tiff, bmp:  codeopen -a Preview &lt;nameOfSupportedFileType&gt;/code  emSo for example:/em  codeopen -a Preview avatarMask@2x.png/code   Opens the png from the current folder in Preview.   <answer263765> There is, but you need to convert the file to postscript or PDF first. For example, I have a function codepman/code which works exactly like regular codeman/code, but opens the codeman/code page in Preview.app:  precodepman ()  {      man -t $* | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app } /code/pre  The code-t/code option tells codeman/code that the output needs to be formatted (using codegroff/code) as postscript.  You want to open a text file in Preview.app. For the "convert to PDF" stage I use codepaps/code, which I installed using codebrew/code:  precodebrew install paps /code/pre  After that, it's easy!  precodepaps info.txt | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app /code/pre  That'll open codeinfo.txt/code in Preview. If you do this a lot, you'll probably want to create a function (in your code~/.bash_profile/code or similar):  precodepreview () {     if [ -z "$*" ]; then         echo "Usage: preview [FILE]"     else         paps $1 | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app     fi } complete -f -X '!*.txt' preview /code/pre  <comment217839> Preview cannot open text files, but the command `open -a Preview photo.jpg` works for me, it opens the image in Preview. <comment217899> If you don't want to risk editing the file, try `open -a Safari info.txt`. <comment234961> I don't think the question was about opening a text file. There is still the question *how to open a pdf file in Preview from the terminal?*. You failed to answer that question. <comment235097> There is no question on 'how to open a pdf file in preview', as the user stated on his example, he already knew how to open files in Preview from the terminal but didn't understood why it didn't worked when trying to open a txt file.  I just answered explaining what kind of files you can open with Preview and how to open any file from the terminal using the default text editor.  Also, other users answered the same, using another example with a image file.  But you've got a point, I could have had answered in a better way. <comment330728> Nice! I tried `cupsfilter` but it didn't occur to me to redirect stderr (doh!). With the redirect you can pipe stdout directly to `open` ( `cupsfilter info.txt 2 /dev/null | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app` )
