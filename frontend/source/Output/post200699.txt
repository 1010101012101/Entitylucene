Why running Time Machine on OS X Server slows down my Mac? <body> I have MacBook Pro (2.3GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD - late 2013?) and Time Machine backups data via network to our internal OS X Server. But when Time Machine is running backups, my computer is completely frozen. Webpages are not loaded, Apple Mail doesn't load/show messages at all, etc. But my colleague doesn't have such problems with his MacBook with the same HW configuration.   What could be wrong?  <answer200702> I found an article that suggests some troubleshooting steps, I'll summarize it here:  ol listrongTest the drive/strong: copy some files to find out if your read / write speeds are normal. This will help you rule out your internal or server drive./li listrongCheck the drive for errors/strong: Again, you can check internal and server drives for errors (bad blocks, permission problems)./li listrongRun a general maintenance routine/strong: you can follow the steps they propose here./li listrongBack up in Safe Mode/strong: reducing the system to a bare minimum may help in isolating the problem./li listrongUninstall or disable drive-monitoring or scanning utilities/strong: Antivirus and other drive scanning software may get triggered by Time Machine activity./li listrongDisable Spotlight/strong: and check for other processes that may be scanning the disk permanently./li /ol  There are a couple of additional suggestions on the article, check it out if this steps do not solve your issue and for a full description of each step.  Also, your colleague may provide a good comparison for troubleshooting: you said your hardware is identical, so:  ul liIs the software setup the same? Any differences may point out the culprit./li liIf software setup is similar, testing hardware on both machines can give you comparison points. For instance, what happens if they use the same Time Machine destination?/li /ul  Finally, check the Activity Monitor prior to and while Time Machine is running, to single out resource hogs.  <comment241888> Have you looked at http://pondini.org/OSX/Home.html? <comment241889> You mention two apps that depend on networking to work properly; are other, non network related apps affected? <comment241890> @JaimeSantaCruz - yes, the whole system is completely frozen.
