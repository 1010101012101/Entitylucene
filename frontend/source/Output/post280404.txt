How do I fullscreen browser content in Google Chrome? <body> I realize that one can run apps in a macOS full screen mode, but sometimes I really want the webpage itself to take up the full screen real estate. And ideally, that would not require me to open such a page in a different browser.  <answer280411> Edit → View Full Screen (⌃⌘F), then Edit → Always show toolbar in full screen (⇧⌘F).  <comment352677> Forgive me I'm a web developer and still don't understand your question.  Could you include a picture or something?
