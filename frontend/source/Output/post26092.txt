Can I display the menu bar in full screen mode in Lion? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How to always show menubar with fullscreen apps?       Is there any way to always display menu bar in full screen mode in Lion?  <answer26113> I don't think so.  An alternative way is like, create a new Desktop, move the application you want to full screen into that new Desktop, and make that application screen as big as the Desktop.  So, you have a dedicated Desktop for that application, full screen, and with the menu bar.  <comment29837> Thanks. That's bit of a hassle, and hope there's a terminal hack to do this soon.
