How to stop iOS Mail from automatically downloading attachments? <body> I would like to know how to stop Mail app on iOS 9.3.5 from automatically downloading the mail attachments. It is taking a lot of space on my iPhone.  <answer266995> goto mail  preference  Accounts  select particular accounts and in AccountInformation tab set DOWNLOAD ATTACHMENT value to NONE.   <answer266997> Most attachments in emails are actually remote images. You can stop iOS Mail from downloading remote images as follows:  ul liGo to Settings/li liTap on Mail/li liUnder the Messages heading, toggle Load Remote Images off/li /ul  In terms of stopping other attachments (e.g. MS Word documents etc), there is no such option to prevent downloading these. However, the way it should work is as follows:  ul liWhen your iPhone is connected to the internet via a cellular network, any email attachments over a certain size will not download automatically./li liInstead, for these attachments you would have to manually select them in the body of the email to emdownload/em them./li liWhen your iPhone is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi, all email attachments will download automatically./li /ul  As far as I'm aware there is no way to stop this, although there emmay/em be 3rd party email apps that give you this option.  If you're sure that emails are taking up a lot of space on your iPhone, you may need to rethink how regularly you delete older emails. You can also filter emails by attachment and then delete the oldest ones to free up space. Another option is to set up a emMailbox/em for emails with attachments so it's easier for you to manually manage them.  <comment334894> what about disabling fetch in Mail options? <comment334979> @JavaTechnical Yes, this would automatically stop downloading attachments, but only because it stops automatically downloading emails altogether!
