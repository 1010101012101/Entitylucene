iPhone 4s only producing mono sound <body> Related to: iPhone 4S stereo sound  This is strange. I know people with the iPhone 4 (not the 4S as I have) who are getting audio from both "boxes". In addition, I don't get stereo with headphones either. I get stereo output but both L and R channels produce just R - meaning the R channel is outputting to both. What is this?  <answer35620> The fact that people say they are getting sound from both grills at the bottom of any iPhone is total nonsense, all models have a Microphone and a speaker at the bottom.  If Apple replaces the microphone with a speaker, the phone would be rendered useless as there would be no way of it picking up speech.  It is a very common misunderstanding.   A couple of things to check.  ul liClean the headphone jack - any dust or fluff can cause the signal to break/li liGo to -SettingsgeneralaccessabilityMono audio make sure this is off/li liCompare with a friend's phone, same model, same track, same head phones, then try new headphones, and after that a new song./li liif there is still a problem go to an Apple store./li /ul  <answer142318> Put some alcohol on a Q . Tip and clean out the Earphone Jack it collects a lot of dirt &amp; grime let dry a few minutes &amp; plug earphones in should be fine  <comment40479> I doubt they are getting audio from both, as there would be no way to speak into the phone if that was the case. As you are getting just the R out put from your headphones, I'm not sure, maybe someone else can help? <comment40483> Which sound sources have you tried? <comment40507> The difference between this and the other post is that this iPhone does not output stereo with headphones either. <comment40518> Have you tried with different headphones? Are you sure the song you're listening to is stereo? Also, your friends are lying to you. I've had iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4 and 4S, and only the right "box" is the speaker: the left, per the article you linked to, is the microphone.
