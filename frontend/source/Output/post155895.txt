iTunes song name <body> I am listening to my local radio (www.otvoreni.hr) using iTunes (i have downloaded stream.pls file and opened it with iTunes) and it is playing properly. Now, no matter how much i tried, i cant find an option to show current song name/artist... and it is driving me crazy -.-  Anybody have any advices? Attached is iTunes screenshot  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PoX9F.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer155909> The stream you are listening to does not provide artist/title information. I confirmed this by playing the stream in VLC. VLC (and iTunes) both show artist/title information when playing a stream from CRIK FM, for example.  <comment183400> Oh, my bad than, since they have current song infos on their site, i tough they would have it in their streaming file as well.Thanks for the help! <comment183417> You're welcome.
