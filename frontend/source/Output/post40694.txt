Run java bundled in .app from command-line <body> The question is how do I run some application written in java and bundled into em.app/em package from command-line?  The main purpose of this is to run an application under JDK7. So I will start it with the codejava/code bundled in JDK7 instead of default one.  I need something like https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/10253/15553 but with java, so I can run it with a different JDK.   <answer40723> To switch to another JVM, try to modify the codeJAVA_HOME/code and codePATH/code shell environment variable in ~/.profile.  precode# in ~/.profile # switch to another JVM (here, 1.7) unset JAVA_HOME PATH export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -F --version 1.7 2&gt;/dev/null)" export PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"  # general info on Java preferences open -a 'Java Preferences' /code/pre  <answer40732> Or open the .app file and edit or add the codeJVMVersion/codevalue in the Info.plist like so  precode&lt;key&gt;JVMVersion&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1.6+&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  <comment46037> You're better of using a *.jar, then a *.app.  App bundles are made specifically for objective-c/c/c++ and so on. You might be able to create a makeshift app, but that would be pointless because you would have to run it manually anyway <comment46039> $Java /Applications[...]/*.app/[...]/java-executable Is this what you mean? Because from my experience this won't work. <comment46040> You're best option is creating an app package that launches the java app using c, using the exec family of functions <comment46044> @rubixibuc I have NetBeans.app. And I need to run it under JDK7. Is the any way of doing in except for making `/usr/bin/java` to point a `java` binary in JDK7 bundle? <comment46045> Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but what I would do if you know c or objective-c, is just have the binary launch the file with exec().  http://linux.die.net/man/3/exec <comment46096> It's a nice idea. But I'm looking for a solution to run just one app with a different java. Thou making the script that will switch java, launch app and switch if back is also an option. Anyway the problem is solved because Netbeans unix-executable binary allows to set a home of JDK as a parameter. But the question is still interesting, and you have pointed out the best working solution this far. <comment46097> Not working. Neither `1.6+` nor `1.7+` <comment46110> Maybe you are missing some other Java Keys there.
