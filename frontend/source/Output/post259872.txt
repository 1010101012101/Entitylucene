Twitter "Could Not Authenticate You" in Notification Center <body> Is anyone else seeing a problem with 10.12.1 where the Twitter module in the Notifications center fails to load any tweets with the message "Could Not Authenticate You" for both emTrending/em and emHighlights/em. I have removed my Twitter account from my Internet Accounts and restored it successfully but this doesn't help the problem.  Anyone else seeing this? I'm not sure if this is a bug, a problem with my configuration, or "pilot error", so if you could try this out and let me know what you see I would appreciate it. Thanks.
