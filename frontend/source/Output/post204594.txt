How to assign a service keyboard shortcut for a specific application (non global) <body> I would like to assign a keyboard shortcut to an automator created service.br  This must be working only for the application the service was created for.br It should override the default application keyboard shortcut (if any).br    Example : Using my text editor, if I press F5, I want it to launch a reload chrome tab service as explained here. br But without activating the normal function associated to this key in the software.   <answer204641> Going from your example, I assume:  ul liYou have an existing Automator service that reloads a Chrome tab./li liIt is set to work in TextEdit only./li liIt is installed (in code~/Library/Services/code)./li /ul  To set an application-specific shortcut then:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard/strong /li liGo to the strongShortcuts/strong tab and choose strongApp Shortcuts/strong at the bottom of the list./li liCreate a new shortcut:  ul liRestrict the shortcut to TextEdit/li liThe name must be exactly the same as the menu title of the service/li /ul/li /ol  img src="https://i.imgur.com/yC36kl8.png" alt=""  <comment246638> Hmm - I believe it's undefined behavior which of the two conflicting key commands activate in the case that an application specific override conflicts with a system wide command.
