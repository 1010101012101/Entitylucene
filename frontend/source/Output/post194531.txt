Mac OS X Systems Administration Resources? <body> I am looking for a good book or similar resources on Mac OS X systems administration. I have a strong Linux background and I'd like to be able to understand the concepts of OS X.  Any recommendations?  Best regards  <answer194545> I don't have a book for you but afp548.com is a good site for sysadmins and may help. It is a full resource including discussions and tools for imaging Macs as well as a Wiki for Mac Sysadmins. Geared mostly for Higher education and corporate uses.  <comment232079> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment232144> @Mark This isn't the standard link-only answer, since OP asked for specific resources, but Steve, if you could be clearer about what's on that page, that could help the answer.
