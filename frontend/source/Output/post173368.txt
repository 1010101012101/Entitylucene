Can't access apache-powered website at localhost <body> I was trying to enable php, mysql, apache on my macbook pro running yosemite. I followed this guide  but it doesn't run. What's wrong in setting up a local web server on OS X  Please help.....I get an error saying http://localhost/ is not available  precodeAbhimanyus-MacBook-Pro:~ abhimanyuaryan$ cat /etc/hosts ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost #::1            localhost     Abhimanyus-MacBook-Pro:~ abhimanyuaryan$ ls -lad /Library/WebServer/Documents /Library/WebServer/Documents/index* drwxr-xr-x  8 root  wheel  272 Feb 18 13:29 /Library/WebServer/Documents -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   49 Feb 18 13:29 /Library/WebServer/Documents/index.html -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   67 Jan  6 14:08 /Library/WebServer/Documents/index.html.en  Abhimanyus-MacBook-Pro:~ abhimanyuaryan$ ps aux| grep http abhimanyuaryan  26010   0.0  0.0  2432772    664 s000  S+   10:21PM   0:00.00 grep http /code/pre  <answer173888> I had errors in my "emprivate/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/em " file. To fix that I replaced the old file with a new file. To check if you have errors in httpd.conf file, write the following commands in terminal:  precodesudo apachectl start   /code/pre  to start apache server  precodesudo apachectl configtest /code/pre  to run test if the file's syntax is alright. If get a return command saying syntax OK. Then file emhttpd.conf/em file is alright.  In my case codesudo apachectl configtest/code output:   precodeAbhimanyus-MacBook-Pro:apache2 abhimanyuaryan$ sudo apachectl configtest AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using Abhimanyus-MacBook-Pro.local. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message Syntax OK /code/pre  Otherwise replace the old file with a new file that I provided above.   precodesudo mv ~/Downloads/httpd.conf  /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf /code/pre  i.e. sudo mv [target] [destination]. You can change the target location of you file. If the new file has not been downloaded to Download folder of Home Directory(~).  Once you are done that now follow the instruction written here by etresoft.  .
