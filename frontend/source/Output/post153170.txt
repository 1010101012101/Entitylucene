New MacBook Pro slow performance, battery not working <body> I have a very recent (mid-2014) MacBook Pro Retina 15" that has been working fine since I got it (about two months).  Suddenly, it has begun to run very slow in all apps, even though CPU usage is very low, and it does not seem to be under stress.  Additionally;  ul liThe battery is not charging, The battery is stuck at 22%./li liIf i disconnect the charger, it completely dies immediately. After restart, date and time is reset to 1st january 2014 0:00/li liThe battery status is "Replace now" even though it should be almost brand new/li /ul  I've tried these things, which did not help:  ul liRestart/li liShutdown/start/li liSMC reset as per http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964/li liPRAM reset as per http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14222/li /ul  Diagnotics info:  OS version: OS X 10.9.5  precodeAbout this mac -&gt; More info -&gt; System report -&gt; Hardware  Hardware Overview: Model Name: MacBook Pro Model Identifier:   MacBookPro11,3 Processor Name: Intel Core i7 Processor Speed:    2,5 GHz Number of Processors:   1 Total Number of Cores:  4 L2 Cache (per Core):    256 KB L3 Cache:   6 MB Memory: 16 GB Boot ROM Version:   MBP112.0138.B07 SMC Version (system):   2.19f7 Serial Number (system): [removed] Hardware UUID:  [removed]   About this mac -&gt; More info -&gt; System report -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Power  Battery Information:  Model Information: Serial Number:  [removed] Manufacturer:   SMP Device Name:    bq20z451 Pack Lot Code:  0 PCB Lot Code:   0 Firmware Version:   702 Hardware Revision:  1 Cell Revision:  1206 Charge Information: Charge Remaining (mAh): 1979 Fully Charged:  No Charging:   No Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 8954 Health Information: Cycle Count:    43 Condition:  Replace Now Battery Installed:  Yes Amperage (mA):  0 Voltage (mV):   7519  System Power Settings:  AC Power: System Sleep Timer (Minutes):   120 Disk Sleep Timer (Minutes): 10 Display Sleep Timer (Minutes):  10 Wake on AC Change:  No Wake on Clamshell Open: Yes Wake on LAN:    Yes AutoPowerOff Delay: 0 AutoPowerOff Enabled:   0 Current Power Source:   Yes DarkWakeBackgroundTasks:    1 Display Sleep Uses Dim: Yes GPUSwitch:  0 PrioritizeNetworkReachabilityOverSleep: 0 Standby Delay:  0 Standby Enabled:    0 Battery Power: System Sleep Timer (Minutes):   60 Disk Sleep Timer (Minutes): 10 Display Sleep Timer (Minutes):  10 Wake on AC Change:  No Wake on Clamshell Open: Yes AutoPowerOff Delay: 0 AutoPowerOff Enabled:   0 DarkWakeBackgroundTasks:    0 Display Sleep Uses Dim: Yes GPUSwitch:  1 Reduce Brightness:  Yes Standby Delay:  0 Standby Enabled:    0  Hardware Configuration:  UPS Installed:  No  AC Charger Information:  Connected:  Yes ID: 0x0aa1 Wattage (W):    85 Family: 0x0085 Serial Number:  [removed] Charging:   No /code/pre  Anyone have a clue what's going on?  <answer162014> The problems were resolved by Apple servicing the hardware.  <comment180293> Simple: off to the Apple Store with this machine! You have one year warranty, so let Apple replace or repair it! <comment180294> Don't forget to create a Backup. It will be one of the first questions they will ask you there and it's for your own benefit. Use TimeMachine in case you haven't done a backup before. <comment180295> @arne, Yes, you're right. It was bought via a third-party so there's going to be some shipping etc involved which will disrupt my work, so I wanted to see if there was a quicker fix. <comment180340> @ade.se If you have proof of purchase, you should still be able to go to Apple to have it fixed. In any case, it sounds that the battery is broken. There won't be any quick fix.
