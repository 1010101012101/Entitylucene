TextEdit wants to save as RTFD because of graphics, but I have used no graphics <body> I have been copying and pasting lots of contact info into a Textedit file. I have been saving as I go along and it saves as .RTF Now suddenly it says:     This document contains graphics and will be saved using RTFD (RTF with graphics) format. RTFD documents are not compatible with some applications. Save anyway?   I have not intentionally put graphics onto document.  How can I find the 'graphic' and delete it?  <answer66693> Try showing package contents in Finder and deleting all the image files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zEsjX.png" alt=""  You can then either move the rtf file outside the rtfd folder, or open the rtfd file in TextEdit, duplicate it, and save it as rtf.  <comment78595> YES!!!!!  Thank you so much.  That did the trick!
