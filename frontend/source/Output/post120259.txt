It seems there are an increasing number of people experiencing failure to boot due to the GPU having died. I'm in Australia and we have just (and are still in) a bit of a heat wave which may have exacerbated the problem.  Anyway, it may be worth trying the steps I outlined in the Q&amp;A I referenced above, particularly booting into Single-User mode and moving the ATI and AMD related extensions out of the way.  HIH  <comment140310> You definately should go to the shop. Your question is very detailed and you've tried (almost?) anything possible what you can do. A hardware-fail is most-likely the issue now. <comment140574> If you have FileVault enabled, how did you successfully remove com.apple.loginwindow.plist from without appearing to unlock your boot disk from single user mode? <comment140598> @grgarside - i ran `/sbin/mount -uw /` from single user mode - which made the filesystem writable <comment140624> That was it! Thanks! <comment140698> I'm glad it helped, and sorry that you too have a dead GPU. Apple had better move to free repair which likely means replacement of the logic board. <comment169265> Incredible, moving away the extensions worked! Thanks! Not sure what I have now, if the GPU is activated, dead or not. Colors look somewhat blueish on the screen and it could be that animations are lagging. Any hints where to go from here now? Thanks again... <comment169351> I now reinstalled Mavericks and everything "seems" to work fine again <comment333448> @house9 did you do the reinstall? Everything ok after that? I did your steps, now my video is with problems and I am preparing for a reinstall, but I am afraid it will not turn on again. <comment333520> @JohnJohnPichler - I took it to the apple store and they replaced the logic board - cost $300 if I recall, there might be warranty for your specific issue, mine was not covered - good luck.
