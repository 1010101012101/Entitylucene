Add more flags to Mail OSX client <body> Is there any way to add more flags to Mail.app (Mountain Lion 10.8.4)? I have a lot of subprojects, and need more flags.  <answer98111> MailTags from http://www.indev.ca can provide you with a number of ways to tag messages in Mail.  You are not going to get a lot of love out of Apple's mail.app otherwise.
