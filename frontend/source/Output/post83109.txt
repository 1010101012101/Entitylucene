MacOSX 10.8 and 32-bit perl modules <body> I just upgraded from MacOSX 10.6 to 10.8.  Many of my projects depend on Mac::Glue, Mac::Carbon and their ilk.  Even though Mac::Glue comes bundled with MacOSX 10.8 perl, it doesn't seem to work:  precode[kw|~] perl -ce 'use Mac::Glue' Can't load '/System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/MacPerl/MacPerl.bundle' for module MacPerl: dlopen(/System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/MacPerl/MacPerl.bundle, 1): no suitable image found.  Did find:     /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/MacPerl/MacPerl.bundle: mach-o, but wrong architecture at /System/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level/DynaLoader.pm line 204.  at /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12/Mac/Glue/Common.pm line 21 Compilation failed in require at /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12/Mac/Glue/Common.pm line 21.

Does anyone have any idea how to fix this problem?  If MacOSX is 64-bit, does that prevent perl from being compatible with 32-bit modules, despite its claim to be compatible with two architectures?  <answer83199> I found a solution to the problem: use the MacOSX 'arch' command to force perl to run as 32-bit.  (See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2088569/how-do-i-force-python-to-be-32-bit-on-snow-leopard-and-other-32-bit-64-bit-quest .)  precode[kw|~] arch -32 perl5.12 -ce 'use Mac::Glue' -e syntax OK /code/pre  Note that one needs the explicit "perl5.12" and not simply "perl", since (on MacOSX 10.8) /usr/bin/perl is a shell script which delegates to either /usr/bin/perl5.12 or /usr/bin/perl5.10.  <answer105754> Actually, there are two other ways to do it, if we refer to codeman perlmacosx/code :  ol liUse "defaults":  precode% defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes  /code/pre/li liUse the environment variable codeVERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT/code set to "true", "yes" or 1/li /ol  With either one, codeperl -ce 'use Mac::Glue'/code gets you: code-e syntax OK/code
