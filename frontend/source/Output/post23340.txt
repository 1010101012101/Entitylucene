Window manipulation software <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Do any window managers allow me to snap windows to the sides of the display?       I was wondering if there is software out there that will make OS X windows act like Windows 7. For instance, you can "bump" a window at the top of the screen and it will fill the screen. Or, "bumping" the left/right will make the window become half-screen.  <answer23348> I just found a nice app for these functions! It's called cinch and it is aviable in the appstore for 7$ (but you can also use the demo)  <answer23352> An alternative to Cinch that is less mouse-based and more keyboard-based is DoublePane. It is available in the Mac App Store. It provides you with easy keyboard shortcuts to place windows side-by-side, full screen or back to their original positions. It is inexpensive and works as advertised. Hope this helps.   <comment26063> Wouldnt it be a better question if you asked for all the software that can do this? It's a rare time when someone prefers paid over a free solution that has no drawbacks. Those on a budget can make a better choice if they can afford the best or make do with the free? Everyone can vote the best and you can always choose the free and comment why later... <comment26066> Hmm...that's true, I'll edit it. <comment26068> What features does the demo not have? <comment26070> Never mind, I figured it out. Every so often, the software displays a reminder to buy the software. <comment26074> Slightly more generic question that should cover this topic: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x
