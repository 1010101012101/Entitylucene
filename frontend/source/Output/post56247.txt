Mute in OS X Mail <body> Gmail offers a feature called “mute” that silently archives future email that arrives in a thread. It makes reply-all threads way nicer to work with.  Is there an add-on or something that enables this behaviour in Mail?  <answer56251> This can be done in stock Mail.app, but it takes a few steps.  First, go to strongMail/strong » strongPreferences…/strong and in the strongGeneral/strong tab, set strongNew messages sound:/strong to emNone/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M2vf8.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then, click the strongRules/strong tab.  Create a new rule.  Under description, type codeSound/code.  Set the rule to apply if emall/em conditions are met.  For any thread you do not want to sound the new messages sound, enter the content of its subject line (not the Fwd: or Re: parts) in the field for emSubject/em then emdoes not contain/em.  For the strongaction/strong, set emPlay Sound/em to emNew Messages Sound/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DeB1k.png" alt="enter image description here"  Whenever you want to add a thread to the exclusion list, add a condition.  If you frequently add threads to this list, this process can be scripted -- but writing that script would be another question (which you're welcome to post if you want to go this route).  <answer285961> I'll give the correct but non-answer: strongNo it's not possible./strong  Gmail's mute feature is proprietary to Gmail. Even if Apple decided they wanted to add the ability to use the feature, I don't think Gmail exposes it over IMAP anyway.  <comment64575> Thanks for your answer Daniel, but I'm not as concerned with the audible sound the messages make when they arrive in a particular thread but that I just don’t see new messages in a muted thread appear. <comment64577> @EdwardOcampo-Gooding Do you want them to be marked as read? If so, same procedure, but change the payload – instead of *all*, say *any*; instead of *Does not contain* say *contains*; instead of *Play Sound* say *Mark as read*. <comment64635> Yep, that’s what I’m after. Is there a hotkey I can hit from the regular mode to add the current subject to a rule? Where should I look if I need to script this kind of action? <comment64647> You could post a question on this site asking for such a script :-) <comment64651> (I'm working on writing such a script; if you post a question asking for an AppleScript to mark all future messages bearing a particular subject line as read, I hope to be able to post an answer to it) <comment64926> sounds good! Thanks. <comment133268> Any news in this thread?
