>console not working in Sierra <body> I am aware that all users must be logged out for console mode to work. After logging out all users (in fact, even after doing codesudo pkill loginwindow/code), console still does not work.   After entering code&gt;console/code for the user name (regardless of entering the password or not) the window goes black and nothing happens.  I can tell that the login is somehow registered, because after I reboot, upon regular login (i.e. not code&gt;console/code), I am asked whether I want to restore the previous session.  I am on Sierra, recently updated. I did not try code&gt;console/code on the previous version.  I have tried this on another Sierra installation (different box). When I entered code&gt;console/code for the user name and hit enter (did not enter the password), I was presented with a login prompt, but the prompt was unresponsive. I was forced to hard reboot. After that, entering code&gt;console/code for the user name, with or without password, results in black screen.  It seems there are some config remnants somewhere that I could just remove to reset everything. Any idea?
