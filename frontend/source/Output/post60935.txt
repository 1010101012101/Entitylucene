How to set iChat status from the command line? <body> I'm trying to sync my Last.FM last played track with my iChat status... right from the command line. I've come this far:  precodecurl -s http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/Da3X/recenttracks.rss |     grep -m 1 -E -e "         &lt;title&gt;(.*)&lt;/title&gt;.*" |     sed "s/.*&lt;title&gt;//" |     sed "s/&lt;\/title&gt;//" /code/pre  which results in the currently or last played track like  precodeThe Black Seeds – Cracks In Our Crown /code/pre  Is there a way to forward this string as the iChat / Messages status now?  <answer60936> This is waaaay too long to try and summarise into an answer here, but there is a really cool script that was written to do the same thing but with iTunes here.   Should give you what you need :-)  <answer60938> Just found it myself... format the output of codesed/code as AppleScript and call codeosascript/code...  precodecurl -s http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/Da3X/recenttracks.rss |     grep -m 1 -E -e "         &lt;title&gt;(.*)&lt;/title&gt;.*" |     sed "s/.*&lt;title&gt;/tell application \"Messages\" to set the status message to \"♬  /" |     sed "s/&lt;\/title&gt;/\"/" |     sed "s/\&amp;amp;/\&amp;/" |     osascript /code/pre  That's it!  <comment70230> minor improvement - replaceing &amp; with & : http://pastebin.com/fAE4dnJk <comment70289> Answer is updated
