Keyboard shortcut to select some text in a cell in Excel <body> I'd like to know the shortcut I must use to do a multiple selection of some text (not adjacent words) in a unique cell. The reason is because I need to highlight some text of the same cell, and I currently have to do it selecting the text individually. So it would be very helpful to find the shortcut to multiple select, as Ctrl + click usually works. I used it time ago, but I don't remember how I did. Please, could you help me  Thanks &amp; regards Susana        <answer222602> I think that the cmd key is your best bet.  I can't try it, i'm not in front of a computer now, but in most OS X programs and also in Word for Mac, the cmd key allows you to select different nonconsecutive strings of text.  <answer222613> AFAIK, there is no way to select non-adjacent words in a cell in Excel. If you need to format several non-adjacent words, you need to process them one at a time.  <comment269774> Are you using Excel for Mac? <comment269778> Guess that's not working in Excel. Not even in the formula bar? <comment269780> Yes, usually Cmd key works for other apps, but not in this case. That's why I wonder how to do it <comment269781> Yes, excel for Mac. But I think it also happens for Windows
