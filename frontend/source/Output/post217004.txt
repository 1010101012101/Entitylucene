How do I get Automator actions for Microsoft Powerpoint and Word? <body> I'm trying to set up Automator with a folder action to convert any Powerpoint or Word documents I drag into it to PDFs.  I found this question: How do I script Powerpoint to save a directory of PPTX files as PDFs?, but I don't have any Automator actions for Powerpoint or Word.  Here's what I see in Automator.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pH9PR.png" alt="Automator Actions"  When I search in actions for "convert", here's what I get.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BFHk3.png" alt="search in Automator for &quot;convert&quot;"  ul liMac OS 10.10.5 /li liPowerpoint version 15.15/li liWord version 15.15/li /ul  <answer217006> Do you have the full version of Microsoft Office installed?br The Automator actions are part of Office &amp; added when Office is installed.br emMicrosoft Office Home and Student Edition does not have Automator Actions/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VqeB6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Also see : Office applications missing in Automator Library  The mention on there of Viewing by Application or Category doesn't appear to prevent them showing in the search, only in the left pane  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DHvNQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer217029> strongMicrosoft Office for Mac 2011/strong (and 2008) includes several Automator workflows, but Microsoft is no longer providing Automator actions for strongOffice 2016/strong.  So, you must run an codeAppleScript/code from the Automator workflow  Here is the script (edited):  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set theOutput to {}     tell application "Microsoft PowerPoint" -- work on version 15.15 or newer         launch         set theDial to start up dialog         set start up dialog to false         repeat with i in input             open i             set pdfPath to my makeNewPath(i)             save active presentation in pdfPath as save as PDF -- save in same folder             close active presentation saving no             set end of theOutput to pdfPath as alias         end repeat         set start up dialog to theDial     end tell     return theOutput end run  on makeNewPath(f)     set t to f as string     if t ends with ".pptx" then         return (text 1 thru -5 of t) &amp; "pdf"     else         return t &amp; ".pdf"     end if end makeNewPath /code/pre  This script return path of the PDF files to the next action.  hr  Here is the workflow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mw6Bv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment262319> I'll have to check with my company's IT dept about that. Thanks for the lead. <comment262812> Great. That basically works, but only if I have PowerPoint open before I drag a file into the folder. If PowerPoint is not open when I drag a file in, I get an error dialog that says "[There was a problem, and Microsoft PowerPoint was closed](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4msJX.png)". <comment262853> Yes, I get this error when **PowerPoint** is not open. I edited the script in my answer, now no error for me. <comment264770> Doesn't work for me in 10.2.2. Automator gives the error "Expected end of line, etc. but found application constant or consideration.". It highlights the word "up" in "set start up dialog"
