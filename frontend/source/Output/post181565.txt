if i have used someone elses apple id to download an app, will it erase when i update my phone on itunes? <body> i used my friends apple id to download a music app that she had downloaded as i could not find it on my apple id, will it erase if i update my phone on my iTunes off my laptop?  <answer181729> The app will not be erased and you can use it. But as Tetsujin said, you cannot update the app to the latest version without your friend's app Apple Id.  <comment215926> No, but every time you need an update, you'll need to enter their credentials againâ€¦ the app belongs to them, not you.
