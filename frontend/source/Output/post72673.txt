Is there a utility OR applescript that will filter Y keystrokes temporarily? <body> Looking for a way to run a script OR a utility that will actively block keystrokes on my QWERTY keyboard.  Specifically, I want to turn off the Y key, if you're curious.  It is a 'problem hotkey' in Pro Tools.  Thanks in advance for any clues! :)  <comment84494> More information on **why** Y is a "problem hotkey" would be welcome. Maybe the problem can be solved differently (for example, by remapping menu shortcuts).
