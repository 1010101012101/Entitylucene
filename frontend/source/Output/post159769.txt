iOS8 disable auto-connect wifi <body> iOS6 used to have the option to disable automatic connection to specific Wifi networks. This is gone in later versions of iOS yet is emcrucial/em in urban areas with abundant open emweb login/em networks in caf√©s etc. Has anyone figured out a hack, a third party app or so, to bring back this crucial feature?  strong(Somebody else has censored this post, removing crucial details needed to avoid flak resulting from misunderstanding / not knowing the 3G signal/wifi issues where I live; see history for them. emManually forgetting/em a network after each use, or constantly turning wifi on/off, are emnot/em solutions!!)/strong  <comment187763> Perhaps you should just turn the wi-fi off when you don't want to use it. <comment187835> The OP wants to use WiFi just top be able to choose which network <comment187941> Somebody edited my original post, removing crucial details. (Lame censorship!) The point is that there are lots of open networks in cafes, that require web login. They are often useful, due to shitty 3G in the UK, so it is impractical to *manually forget* the network after each use. But also at home keeping wifi enabled is crucial because of sh*tty 3G on this island. <comment218674> Someone please tell me how to stop this. I'm about to burn my iPhone!!
