`CFPasteboardRef CFPasteboardCreate(CFAllocatorRef, CFStringRef) - failed to create global data` warning in vim <body> I just installed vim using brew  precode$ brew install vim  /code/pre  I am on a ssh connection to a MacOSX desktop. I am heavily using codehomebrew/code.  As soon as try to delete a character or copy something in vim, I get the following warning message:  code [15020] CFPasteboardRef CFPasteboardCreate(CFAllocatorRef, CFStringRef) : failed to create global data /code I suspect the vim is not able to access system clipboard.   There is ticket on macport (https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-tickets/2016-May/205983.html), it looks like that it wasn't resolved.   I installed fakeclip plugin in vim but it didn't help either.   Any suggestions on how to get rid of this annoyance over ssh connection?  strongUPDATE/strong  precode$ sudo -u dilawars vi filename  /code/pre  works great. So it is almost certain that issue is with access to clipboard.  <comment350850> I still get the issue even with sudo -u <comment353176> I got the same error. I was able to work around it. My info may provide some clues to your problem.  I had a GNU screen session open in Terminal.  I logged off.  When I logged back on and reattach to the screen session (screen -r), pbcopy in the screen session's bash shells started getting the above error. Also, "open some_file" now hung.  sudo didn't work either:  sudo pbcopy some_file sudo: unknown uid: 502   # 502 is my uid  If I start a new GNU screen session: everything works.  Your copy/delete/clipboard problem in vim via ssh to remote OSX machine seems related.
