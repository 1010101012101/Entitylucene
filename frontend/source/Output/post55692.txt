Now that Apple have stopped selling Click Wheel Games is there a repository for them? <body> I'm aware that I'm probably some kind of technological dinosaur but I love my click-wheel iPod. Now that Apple had stopped selling the click wheel games is there somewhere else I can get them?  Is there an equivalent to cydia / or jail-breaking my iPod classic to get home brew or the like games on it?  <answer55698> I tried and failed to find a repository a while back, however if you're lucky, there are torrents for the complete archive which crop up sometimes. Obviously the torrents exist in multiple places, but there are rarely any seeders.  Obviously you'd have had to purchase them to be entitled to use them, and if you had purchased them, you wouldn't have been able to download them again as this was all before you were able to re-download purchased apps, so this may be an ideal solution to get things you'd lost and not backed up.  <answer63884> There's ways and means of getting the iPod games but they're predominately illegal, if it's just those games you want I'd contact Apple as whilst they've probably stopped selling them somewhere they won't have gotten rid of them completely. If it's just a case of extra functionality and games for it I'd highly recommend looking at the Rockbox project which does come with games and is still under active development.  Here's Rockbox and there's plenty of information online about it.  <comment63916> That would be pirating those games if the publisher did not choose to release them to public to start with. <comment73627> Please edit this so it's clear you are asking about legitimate games being released or at least open source so this doesn't read as a solicitation for instructions on how to get pirated software. We happily host the former type of question. <comment73887> This looks great now. Feel free to flag if answers or edits drive this off track down the line... Thanks @nicholassmith and Omar
