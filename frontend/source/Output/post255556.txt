iTunes won't play song from Apple Music if mp3 in Library is missing <body> I created a playlist on the Music app on my iPhone, where I have an Apple Music subscription. I've successfully streamed songs on this playlist to my iPhone; they're streaming from Apple's cloud.  On my MacBook, in my iTunes library, I have some of these songs as "physical" mp3s on an external hard drive. When I load the playlist in iTunes on my MacBook, it wants to play the songs it knows I have physical copies of from the external hard drive, but will happily stream songs that I don't have mp3s of from the Apple Music cloud.  The trouble is, if that external hard drive isn't connected, the songs that iTunes knows I have mp3s of don't play at all. Rather than reverting to streaming from the cloud, they just refuse to play.  Worse, they stop the playlist entirely; rather than just quietly moving on to the next song, iTunes throws up a dialog box that I have to dismiss before I can move on to a song that it emis/em able to find.  So, the fact that I have an mp3 of certain songs has actually made it emmore difficult/em to listen to them if they appear on a playlist.  Is it possible for iTunes to use the Apple Music cloud as a "back up" for songs it knows I have, but that it can't currently find?
