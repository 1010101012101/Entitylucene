iCloud documents "waiting" <body> Ever since I restored my Mac from a Time Machine backup to return from Yosemite to Mavericks, things have been a mess. I fixed everything but iCloud sync, which seems to be an impossible issue. It simply refuses to sync. The files are always "Waiting", no matter what I do. I've deleted the codeUbiquity/code folder, replaced the codeMobile Documents/code folder, run codekillall -9 ubd/code, rebooted about 20 times, and so on. Any other ideas out there?  <answer143595> Upgrading to iCloud Drive is a one-time, strongirreversible action/strong. You can not go back from iCloud Drive to Documents &amp; Dataâ€”your Apple ID has been permanently upgraded.     Migrating to iCloud Drive will disable Documents &amp; Data syncing for your iCloud account on OS X Mavericks and earlier Macs, as well as iOS 7 and earlier devices.   supSource: OS X Yosemite release notes/sup
