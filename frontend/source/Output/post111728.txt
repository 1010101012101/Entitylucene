Mac OS X trustevaluation agent is stuck <body> Am doing frontend dev for a web app on Mac OS X 10.7.5. In the last couple of days I observe that whenever I refresh the webapp am developing, the server (written by other people) takes a long time to respond (about 50-60 seconds).  I ran the top command and I saw that during this waiting period a process called codetrustevaluat/code (code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TrustEvaluationAgent.framework/Versions/A/Reso‌​urces/trustevaluationagent/code) is 'stuck'. Once that gets unstuck, I observe the server has responded just after that!  Any ideas how to resolve this?  <comment131356> Let's see where this process is coming from. Can you run `ps -ef | grep trust` and add the result to the question? <comment131357> Thanks for the quick response. The result of the abv command is:   501  1916   136   0  1:26PM ??         0:00.47 trustevaluationagent` <comment131358> 501 is probably your own user id. Are you sure this is a system process and not something which is part of the 3rd party server app? `find / -name trustevaluationagent -print` should answer that (after some time)... <comment131359>  find / -name trustevaluationagent -print    /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TrustEvaluationAgent.framework/Versions/A/Resources/trustevaluationagent
