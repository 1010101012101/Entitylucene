Outlook - Smart search <body> Say I want to quickly find all emails by one person.   In some email editors you can type code"from: John"/code and it would understand that you are only interested in messages that John strongsent/strong.  Is this possible with Outlook in OS X? What about Mail?  <answer119191> Outlook 2011 for Mac can do that: just skip the space. So, codefrom:John/code.   It shows your smart search options as you type. Click one of these (or just type them with the colon), and it'll search only that type of thing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ka4Bz.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Or, you can click in the quick search box, then click the strong"From" button/strong in the "strongsearch/strong" ribbon section that appears...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RG7QI.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...then type "John" in the different box that appears.  Less typing, but one extra click.
