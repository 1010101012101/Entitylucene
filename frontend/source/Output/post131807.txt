After closing and reopening the lid, I do not hear any more audio. Why is this? <body> I have a 15 inch late '13 rMBP. After closing and reopening the lid, and playing a music video on YouTube, I cannot hear the audio. I always have to restart the system in order to fix this issue. This does not happen all of the time. I want to know why this is happening, and how I can fix this problem. Anyone else have this issue?  <comment154884> how do you get to the YouTube?
