iPhone 4S linked to old Apple Id <body> I'm trying to clean my old iPhone for selling it.  iCloud address is a different Apple Id from the one I'm using now.  I can not see a way to reset the password for the old linked Apple id.

Please correct me if I'm wrong: you have an iPhone linked to an old Apple ID that you want to erase, but you've forgotten the password and are unable to recover it (why?). <comment283561> I have an old I phone that is a 4s.  I want to send it in so I can get some money but I need to erase all the info on it.  I am not able to do this because to do this I need to enter the old and now invalid apple id which is not my current apple id.  I have tried all of the pass words that I have used to no avail.  I do not see any way to get a new pass word requested for this old apple id. <comment283874> [Can you not recover your Apple ID?](https://iforgot.apple.com)
