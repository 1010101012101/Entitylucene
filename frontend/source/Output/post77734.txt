Gibberish volume in finder which is inaccessible and un-deletable <body> I'm not sure when it got there, but there is what looks like the icon for a time machine volume in my favorites sidebar for finder, but its name is gibberish : "_fTz328nSUG4ZgV4k5KaRm." If I click on it the name flashes the top of the finder window with the body blank then goes back to whatever the window was displaying before. I can't right click it. I can't drag it into the trash, although I can drag it around the favorites bar. I don't know where it came from, but I would like to get rid of it so I don't have to look at it any more. I am running OSX 10.7.5 on an early 2008 Macbook Pro.   <answer77735> h2Drag it off the Favorites bar?/h2  You didn't give enough details, so I'm not sure you can do this, but hold down the âŒ˜strongCommand/strong  button and drag it off the Favorites bar (anywhere on the screen). You will see a cloud-like animation beneath the pointer. Then, release it. br / strongPOOF!/strong It is out of the Favorites bar strongand/strong your hair. :)  <comment90038> I can't believe that the answer was so simple. I'd tried it before but I didn't know you had to hold the command key. Thanks! <comment90047> You're Welcome.
