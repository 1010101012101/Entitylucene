Deploying default Wifi settings and Passwords <body> I am building a default 10.8 image for our corporate Mac users.  We have a local Wifi network which should be set up by default on this image.  I have used PackageMaker to set up all the other deployed software and settings, and would emlike/em to keep it that way.  I am using InstaDMG to build the image (another reason to prefer the modular packaging method I have in place).  I have tried deploying a .keychain file to code/Library/Keychains//code, but the AP is not picked up;      I am also aware of code/Library/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist/code but after deploying this, the system still does not result in the expected behavior.  How can I deploy system-wide Wifi settings to a unbooted images using packages?  <answer77142> I believe PackageMaker includes some first-run scripts, does it not? The easiest way is probably to make use of the networksetup command line tool in a script set to run on the first launch of an image.  To add a WPA network:  precodenetworksetup -addpreferredwirelessnetworkatindex AirPort mynetworkSSID 0 WPA superSecretPassword /code/pre  The encryption type can be one of:  ul licodeOPEN/code â€” open hotspot, no passphrase necessary of course./li licodeWPA/code/li licodeWPAE/code (WPA Enterprise)/li licodeWPA2/code/li licodeWPA2E/code (WPA2 Enterprise)/li licodeWEP/code/li licode8021XWEP/code (802.1X WEP)/li /ul  <comment89442> You might want to specify the OS you are building, as there are major changes between 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 as to how network configurations can be imported and exported. <comment89662> OS Version Added.
