Way to add new even to calendar from a link on an iOS Device? <body> I was looking at Icon Project today on Lifehacker, and they ran a story about how you can use it to create quick access icons to things like brightness and wifi.  I also noticed that some of these have URL arguments in them.  Now is there any documentation of this functionality I can look at, and is there a way to create a new calendar event using arguments and this functionality on an iOS device?
