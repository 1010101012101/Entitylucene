Where is a dmg file mounted? <body> When I double click a dmg file it's mounted (or so I assume) in the filesystem. I want to explore the dmg file in the terminal for hidden files (like the background for example), but I'm not sure where it's mounted - I checked /media and /mnt, but it's not there.  <answer35055> All volumes, including DMGs, are mounted in code/Volumes/code.  You can get a list of mounted volumes by typing codels /Volumes/code in Terminal.  You can navigate to a Disk Image using codecd /Volumes/nameOfImage/code.  <comment39953> You can also drag files and folders from the Finder into a Terminal window, and it'll paste in their path(s).  This is an easy way to find out where something's mounted in the unix filesystem. <comment39981> I don't use OSX, but can you not type `mount` in the terminal to see all mounted "volumes" <comment40045> @user606723 Yes, you can use `mount`. It shows the volumes that are mounted, their mount points, how they're formatted, etc. <comment40636> You can also drag them to the spotlight search box and it'll expand the full path there. <comment40732> Actually, you can get a list of mounted volumes by typing `mount` in Terminal. Some volumes may be mounted outside of `/Volumes` (like FileVault) and not everything under `/Volumes` *has* to be a volume. (It should be, but sometimes normal directories get created under there)
