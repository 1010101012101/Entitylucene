How to extract an .ace compressed file? <body> Is there a way to open .ace compressed file on macOS? I tried searching for solutions but haven't come across any method to extract it yet.  <answer271018> You have the following three options:  ul liThe Unarchiver, which supports only older ACE archives (not created with WinAce). It is available either as a direct download, or from the Mac App Store (with further restrictions/sandboxing)./li liRAR, which can decompress ACE archives. On macOS, it is only available as a command-line utility. As I recall, it supports WinAce archives./li liMacUnace from the makers of WinAce. Note that this is a very old executable, dating back to 2003. Compatibility is not guaranteed. And beware that some versions of WinAce used to ship with bundled adware./li /ul  <answer273333> The commandline Mac version of RAR does not do .ace files, even if the author's site says their GUI Windows one (WinRAR) can.  I just tried: "cait_farm.ace is not RAR archive". (Nice grammar, there.) I've tried both their freeware version and their trial commercial version.  It's correct that The Unarchiver can't handle WinAce files; its failure is why I came looking.  MacUnace doesn't run on modern Macs, nor (obviously) will the GUI wrapper for it, UnaceX.  Seems our only option is to take the .ace to a Windows box, or run Windows in a virtual machine to do it (I keep a Win7 VM around for tasks like this, but it's a hassle.)  <answer287441> Shameless plug: With acefile there is now a python based solution to uncompress ACE archives, that is slow, but works on OS X.  Simply make sure you have Python 3 and then install codeacefile/code:  precodepip3 install acefile /code/pre  Then you will have the codeacefile-unace/code utility installed, that you can use to extract ACE archives, including the newer ACE 2.0 format that is not supported by most archivers with ACE support on platforms other than Windows.  Run something like:  precodeacefile-unace -x example.ace /code/pre  You may have to explicitly give the codebin/code path of your python installation if you don't have that in your PATH (e.g. code/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin//code).  <answer288294> Just use Boxer (http://boxerapp.com/) and the original ACE (http://www.winace.com/files/ace26.exe)  <comment340650> An `ae` file or an `ace` file? Your title and question disagree. <comment340652> @owlswipe my bad <comment340661> No worries. And IMHO just go with the unarchiver for anything like this. <comment341108> I already have The Unarchiver but I wasn't able to export the file. <comment362926> What do you mean by *Shameless plug*? You may need to add a sentence just to clarify. <comment363223> Shameless plug means I wrote acefile.
