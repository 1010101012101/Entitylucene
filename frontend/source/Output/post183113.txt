iPad not playing YouTube videos in Safari <body> My iPad won't play YouTube videos.  I order to solve the problem I have tried:  ul liTurning the iPad off and back on./li liRefreshing the YouTube webpage in the browser./li liOpen the webpage in a new browser tab./li /ul  None of these actions have solved the problem.   What else can I do to get the YouTube videos to play?  <comment218195> What browser are you using? Does this happen with all videos? Are you able to play videos through a YouTube app? <comment218196> I've inferred that you're using Safari, but feel free to edit your question to clarify. <comment218252> Not sure about this, but have you tried going to `https://www.youtube.com/html5` and enabling the HTML5 player? <comment218419> The YouTube app won't even download  and trying the HTML5 player <comment218421> It's now fixed now thanks for the help thow <comment218749> @Inofearu would you provide the solution as an answer or consider deleting this if you don't want answers from others? <comment218817> I tried the HTML3 player and restarting my wifi and I pad mini and it was fixed <comment274138> Can some one close this I can't if so how
