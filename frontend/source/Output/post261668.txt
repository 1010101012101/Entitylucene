Switch context to new window on right-click open in dock <body> I will consider the Sublime Text as an example application here.  When I click the app icon in Dock, it opens and the context immediately switches to it (Sublime window). This is noted as the top panel changes to Sublime.  When using multiple Desktops, I use to have multiple instances of the same app in different Desktops. To open a new instance in another Desktop, I move to new Desktop and right-click open the Dock app icon, so the new app window opens in the current Desktop. In this situation, the context (top panel) don't switches to the new app window.  Is there some way to have this behavior? Or isn't it desirable in general?
