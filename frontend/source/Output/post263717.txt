multiboot mbp retina. windows re-install failed. can i fix the "reset" (from inside windows) from another OS? <body> I decided I needed to "reset" Windows 10 (from within Windows) as I had given up on fixing some issues. Then during the reset/reinstall it froze and I had to power it off. Now when I boot into the Windows partition (rEFInd) to continue it, a "Preparing..." shows up but then a dialog box pops up saying I have to hit "Ok" and reinstall.   The problem is that the reinstall was from within Windows 10 and now I can't get in there. I see Windows files from inside Mac partition and the Linux partitions but wouldn't know what to do to "fix" Windows enough to get the reset going again. I also don't know enough rEFInd commands to get to Windows, or its recovery, that way.  Do you think it is safe enough to just wipe the two partitions for windows (windows and its recovery) and then install from a USB Bootcamp install (the one I originally used)?  Thank you!  PS.  For instance, from with OS X, I see under the Bootcamp partition the usual files and folders like Program Files, ProgramData, Users, etc, but I also see new things like $SysReset and $WINDOWS.~BT. From within the $SysReset folder I see directories; AppxLogs, Logs, MDM, Scratch, and Triggers.dat. There is also a file called ResetSession.xml and inside it are settings like TargetCapacity="100.... and TargetOffset=.... and OverwriteSpace="False"...  Maybe somewhere in something like this there is a way to get the reset going again?
