node npm Installing bower = npm ERR <body> New computer, fresh start. Was installing bower from terminal and got this ERR! message in return. Seems common, but i'm hesitant in forcing it with sudo.  ul liOSX 10.10.3/li ligit version 2.3.2 (Apple Git-55)/li linpm (2.9.1)/li linode v0.12.3 are installed./li /ul     codenpm install -g bower/code   precodenpm ERR! tar.unpack untar error /Users/username/.npm/bower/1.4.1/package.tgz npm ERR!

Do as it says and run with sudo, and you will be able to proceed.  This isn't "forcing" it, it's just elevating your permissions to do something that isn't safe to have accessible to non-administrators, thus requiring sudo.  <answer246837> type codesudo npm install -g bower/code  <comment222675> First part is not really correct - but needing sudo and the reason is correct <comment222676> Actually, it is. All binary directories require root access to write to. Do you have an unusual configuration? <comment222677> I have command line software installed in ~/bin - the issue is not command line but usable by multiple sirs (or the directory installed in is not per user) <comment222678> again, that is an unusual configuration. Normally the only bin directories that come with a Mac is /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. All of those directories require root permissions to access. <comment222695> @Froggard thanks for your explanation. I did run sudo npm install -g bower and looks like bower got installed. Although when doing bower -v it return me with -bash: bower: command not found. What I'm I doing wrong? Thanks <comment222697> @Mark after an echo $PATH = to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/git/bin could this be the problem? I'm very new to this, your help is very appreciated. Thanks again <comment222700> Uncertain. I just ran the command, and it installed it for me. `bower -v` works correctly. Try closing your terminal window, and opening a new one. <comment222706> @Froggard such a simple solution. It worked. Thanks for your help <comment304514> Welcome to Ask Different.
