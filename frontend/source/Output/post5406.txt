Is there way to save google maps for offline iphone without jailbreak <body> I've iPhone 3Gs and want to strongdownload Google maps to use them offline with GPS/strong.  So is there a good app do that for me ?  Note: i don't want to jailbreak my iPhone.  <answer5407> h1NO./h1  You can't download stuff like that for offline without a jailbreak.  <answer5408> I know it's not very helpful but some Android phones do have this capability.  http://www.htc.com/www/product/desirehd/overview.html for example.  <answer5409> No, nor will you find one (in the official App Store). Storing the image tiles breaches Google's data licence. There are a bunch of apps that use OpenStreetMap, which has a more liberal licence.  <answer95443> I would recommend  Offline+Maps  https://itunes.apple.com/app/offline+maps/id502648393  or  City maps 2 Go https://itunes.apple.com/app/city-maps-2go/id327783342  <comment5528> You can, actually. http://modmyi.com/cydia/package.php?id=10733 <comment5529> @Sathya: Thanks, edited my answer accordingly. <comment5530> As Stephen noted, it's against the licensing terms. Last time I looked they allowed for some small images like they have next to directions, but other than that you're out of luck (and they definitely don't respond to GPS).
