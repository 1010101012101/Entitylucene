Microsoft Outlook: Viewing Messages <body> I am currently having an issue with Microsoft Outlook 2011. Whenever I open a message and attempt to drag it down, the moment I release my cursor the message box returns to its original position. I have looked through the preferences, I was not able to find any setting concerning this issue.  <comment42471> Drag it down? Can you post a screenshot of what you mean?
