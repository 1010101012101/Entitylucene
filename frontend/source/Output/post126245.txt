Can I turn on the hotspot in objective-c in IOS 7? <body> Can I turn on the strongcodehotspot/code/strong in strongcodeobjective-c/code/strong in strongcodeiOS 7/code/strong?  I've searched StackOverflow, and some information I've found has said strong"objective-c does not support turning on the codepersonal hotspot/code"./strong But this information was from a few years ago.  Does strongcodeobjective-c/code/strong support turning on the strongcodehotspot/code/strong in strongcodeiOS 7/code/strong now?  <answer126246> You cannot enable such System settings via any app (at least without a jailbreak). strongObjective-c/strong results in an app for an iOS-device, thus you cannot achieve this.  Apple does not allow any app which tries to enter the App Store to activate:  ul liWiFi/li liLocation services/li liPersonal hotspot/li liMany more features not named above/li /ul  <comment147825> Thanks for your reply. If I turn on the `hotspot` by `Setting UI` , can I get the information for the client which connected to this `hotspot` ? <comment147826> You should go to SO for this, if you want to achieve this via code. <comment147827> Sorry...I am new for this. What is the SO ? <comment147828> https://stackoverflow.com <comment147830> I see. Thanks for you ! Best Regards !
