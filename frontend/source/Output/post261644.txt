IOS 10, 5s broken - In app message reply is deleted if interrupted <body> IOS 10, Iphone 5s  I have a problem when quick responding to an IOS Message or text from in another app. IOS 10 forgets what i've written in the pull down.  The problem occurs when I am in the middle of responding to a text. If another alert happen like an alarm, then this will take over and delete what i have written.  This was better in IOS 9. When this happened, and it often did, I could confidently go to the message app and continue my interrupted message reply.  ol liDoes anyone get this?/li liDoes anyone else find this annoying?/li /ol  How to reproduce this yourself:  - set an alarm e.g 9:00am  - Ask someone to text you 3 mins before alarm goes off  - Go to another app except message app  - When the message alert pops up, pull it down to reply in app  - Then write a reply until the alarm goes off  - The message will not save  If you have a workaround amazing please reply.  @Ryanniccolls
