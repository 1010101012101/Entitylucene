Keyboard shortcut (hotkey) for switching keyboard layout on iOS <body> I use iPad mini 4 (iOS 10.1.1) with a Logitech bluetooth keyboard (k380). I often need to switch the keyboard layout because I use more than one language in my writings.   Currently I have to turn off the keyboard and click on the "world" icon on the screen keyboard to change its layout. Then turn on the keyboard. Not practical.  Is there a keyboard shortcut for switching keyboard layout on iOS?  <answer261525> kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd.  Did you know that answers on SE must be at least 30 characters?  <comment327495> Control + Space as well. <comment327498> @TomGewecke Can you confirm this on iOS 10? <comment327505> Yes, works fine for me.  Same as for MacOS.
