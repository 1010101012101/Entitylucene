How to configure where Lion fullscreen apps open <body> I recently noticed that when I fullscreen an app, it opens as a new space all the way to the right, after all my desktops. I don't think this is how it worked before -- I seem to recall that it used to open the fullscreen app immediately to the right of my current desktop.  Is there a way to configure this? Where are fullscreen apps opened on most users' operating system?  <answer50702> Look at emSystem Preferences  Mission Control/em and see if 'Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use' is checked.  When strongchecked/strong, fullscreen windows open to the strongimmediate right/strong.  When strongunchecked/strong, fullscreen windows open strongat the far right/strong, after all other desktop spaces.  You can also rearrange desktop spaces by dragging them to the order you prefer in Mission Control.  (I'm running 10.7.3)  <comment58120> For info, manually reordering spaces and fullscreen apps was added in the 10.7.2 update. <comment58147> This works perfectly - thanks!
