How to customize .inputrc to make Command-Delete and Option-Delete delete lines and words in iTerm 2? <body> I'd like to add a little bit of consistency between editing text in the terminal and editing text in normal OS X programs. I use iTerm2, but I imagine any solution would involve using readline and code.inputrc/code which probably would work in most terminals.  Specifically, I was thinking of adding:  ul likbdCommand/kbd-kbdDelete/kbd: Delete to start of line before cursor/li likbdOption/kbd-kbdDelete/kbd: Delete word before cursor/li likbdOption/kbd-kbdLeft/Right Arrow/kbd: Move cursor between words/li likbdCommand/kbd-kbdLeft/Right Arrow/kbd: Move cursor to start/end of line/li /ul  h2Questions/h2  ul liHow could code.inputrc/code be configured to support these keyboard shortcuts?/li liWould any of these shortcuts generate conflicts with existing terminal or command-line shortcuts?/li liAre there any other shortcuts that would be useful to create consistency with standard OS X text editing keys?/li /ul  As a side note, I am aware that there are Vi and Emacs style shortcuts for performing these operations. In fact I use Vi-style shortcuts quite a lot on the command-line. However, sometimes when my mind hasn't shifted modes, it’s disruptive. Thus, it would be nice if the terminal could support both OS X and Vim style shortcuts.  <answer71728> emPreliminary answer; still hunting for other key combinations/em  The following post explains how to configure Alt+left/right in Iterm2. Interestingly, it requires both the configuration of code.inputrc/code and customisation of iTerm2.  <answer71762> ⌘← can be assigned to code\eOH/code and ⌘→ to code\eOF/code. You could assign ⌥← to code\eb/code like in Terminal, but it doesn't work in vi mode or nano.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOYuu.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IYIfF.png" alt=""  In emacs mode you could also add this to .inputrc:  precode"\e[1;9D": backward-word "\e[1;9C": forward-word "\e[3~": kill-word /code/pre  codeC-v/code shows the escape sequence for the next key combination. code^[/code is ESC in caret notation. codebind -p/code prints currently bound commands.
