Enabling Folder Actions Within OS X? <body> There is an element to OS X known as strongFolder Actions/strong, which causes certain actions or events to occur when items are either added or removed from user specific folders.  How can I enable this ?  (I am using OS X 10.6.8, but if the activation differs for OS X 10.7.5 or 10.8.4 this is also welcomed)  <answer97638> To enable folder actions open your Automator.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e9Ult.png" alt="enter image description here"  There you can create folder actions pending your needs.  Once you have created it, right click on any folder and in the pop up choose the desired action.  <answer97639> Firstly, bear in mind that strongFolder Actions/strong can be configured through strongAppleScript/strong to perform a huge variety of actions, and that there are some default scripts among which you'll find the emadding / removing/em action you mention.   Since strong10.6/strong the strongFolder Actions Setup/strong panel is accessible through any folder's contextual menu:  ol liDo kbdControl/kbd+click (or emright click/em) on any folder for the emcontextual menu/em to show. /li liChoose strongFolder Actions Setup/strong. ( If you've got any emeligible/em services already, it would be slightly different as you'll have to go to choose strongServices/strong and then strongFolder Actions Setup/strong.)/li liChoose the strongadd - new item alert/strong script from the prompt window./li liSelect the emEnable Folder Actions/em option in the upper-left side of the setup's window./li /ol  You'll have, though, to edit the script for it to do something emuseful/em as, right not, it only displays an alert saying that an new emitem/em has been added to the folder.  <comment114602> The actions are predetermined & numerous ?
