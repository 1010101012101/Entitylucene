How to use macports Python in a cron job? <body> I have installed Python 2.7 through mac ports, and now want to have it used in a cron job. Unfortunatly, each time the cron job gets involved, the standard Python of my machine (an iBook G4 using Tiger) which is 2.3 is involved, making my job fail.  My PATH is (from the codeset/code command)  precodePATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin /code/pre  P  How can I have my cron job be invoked with my codePATH/code instead of the faulty one ?  <answer248751> The result of the PATH variable is quite different in the emcron/em world. Invoke the script with the full path to the empython/em binary (e.g. /opt/local/bin/python2.7) and you should be good.  This can be examined by running codeenv/code as cronjob and comparing it to the result of running codeenv/code as yourself in Terminal:  user's cron env:  precodePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin ... SHELL=/bin/bash HOME=/Users/user USER=user PWD=/ ... /code/pre  compared to user's env:  precodePATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin ... SHELL=/bin/bash HOME=/Users/user USER=user PWD=/Users/user ... /code/pre  hr  Alternatively you may add the PATH to the crontab:  precodesudo nano /var/cron/tabs/user /code/pre  In newer systems (probably â‰¥10.6):  precodesudo nano /private/var/at/tabs/user /code/pre  Change  precode...  *       *       *       *       *       some command /code/pre  to  precode... PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin  *       *       *       *       *       some command /code/pre  <comment308334> Just start the python task with the full path to python in the cron job i.e. /opt/local/bin/python - Unless has complex dependencies this should not require path changes <comment308342> Of course, you can change the value of PATH in your crontab. <comment308344> I just set the WAYBAC machine to 10.4, you will find crontabs in /etc/crontab. <comment308345> @fd0 Thanx for this. My VM smorgasbord only include 10.6 and newer... <comment308787> I was mistaken, `/etc/crontab` is the "system" crontab. User crontabs are found in `/var/cron/tabs` in 10.4.
