Location of /etc/fstab in El Capitan <body> I want to activate the NTFS support. But I can't find the /etc/fstab on my mac. osx 10.11.5 El Capitan  <answer244575> code/etc/fstab/code doesn't exist by default, only if anything has previously needed it. codefstab/code itself is merely a text file. If nothing has previously needed one, you can make it yourself.  The standard header appears to be a comment with vague instructions as to how the syntax works...  precode# fstab # # Identifier  mount point  fs type  options1 # /code/pre  below that is your mount or ignore instruction, e.g.   precodeUUID=C126C736-1585-3D12-9CF1-F95EFF0CF744 none hfs rw,noauto   /code/pre  or    precodeLABEL=[drivename] none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  There is far more information on codefstab/code at https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/fstab.5.html than I could possibly précis here, or type codeman fstab/code in Terminal.  <comment301402> you mean you can't find /etc/ or you can't find fstab inside it? fstab may not exist at all; you can simply create it, it's a text file <comment301403> I can't find the file fstab. But will it work, if it does not exist anymore? <comment301404> It only exists if something needed one before, otherwise you need to create it yourself <comment301408> You're right. That's all. If you write your comment as an answer, I'll accept it. <comment301417> The manual page for `fstab` is included in OS X, in a Terminal type `man fstab`, or directly from Apple [FSTAB(5)](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/fstab.5.html). There is no need to link to a Linux OS Wiki which contains some information that is not at all applicable to OS X.
