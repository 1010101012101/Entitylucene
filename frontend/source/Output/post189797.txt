How can I programatically remove folder from Finder's Favorites? <body> I installed one app which adds special folder to my Favorites sidebar in Finder. I like the app, but I don't like polluting the sidebar. Unfortunately, the app doesn't allow me to turn off the behavior and even if I manually remove the folder, it appears again after some time (didn't do any special tests though whether it's after restart or when...).  My idea is that if I could come with some bash command to remove this folder from Finder's sidebar, I could put it to code.bash_profile/code so it gets executed quite often. I'd fight with the same weapons - from time to time, I'd just remove the folder if present. The question is - is there some command?  I looked for it, but couldn't find any clues. Is there e.g. some text or XML file with Favorites listed I could programatically edit in bash?  <comment225179> Does right click, 'remove from sidebar' not work? Is that what reappears; it's not clear how you 'manually removed' it. <comment225209> What app is in question. If it adds itself back in, this is really about modifying that app since your script and the app will then just engage in a tug of war contest. <comment225245> The app is [iDrive Sync](http://idrive.com/), sort of Dropbox. "Manually removed it" means the right click. I can't modify the app, so the tug of war contest is my only option I guess.
