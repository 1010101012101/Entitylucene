Which Trans Music Manager equivalents exist for OS X? <body> I have a Denon DP-200USB turntable that converts analogue records (LPs) into MP3s (one MP3 per side) and stores them onto a USB memory stick.  This lovely piece of kit comes with some software called Trans Music Manager (PDF) that will automatically split tracks (based on silence between tracks) followed by naming and tagging them using Gracenote.   Sadly this software runs under Microsoft Windows, for which I don't have a licence.  Are there any solutions out there that can do this easily under Snow Leopard? Free and open-source software is preferred, but paid-for alternatives would be considered.  <answer16211> I haven't personally tried it, but strongAudioSlicer/strong may be a good candidate     AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI application   for Mac OS X that finds all silences   in an audio file and allows you to   split it into several smaller audio   files and to name/tag them properly.   Doesn't seem to do the Gracenote tag fetching, but you could use strongJaikoz/strong (tag from MusicBrainz db) or strongSimpleTagger/strong (tag from Amazon db) for that.  <answer116007> Open in QuickTime Player and save as iPhone.  <comment17666> You could install windows under virtual box. <comment17694> @romeovs: Windows, even under VirtualBox, requires a licence (which I stated I do not have) and system updates each and every time I start the virtual machine. I am looking for an application, not an operating system. <comment17711> Oops, I read over that. I just proposed this because it's the easy way out... <comment135743> Please note that saving for iPhone will not split the track based on silence, nor tag automatically using Gracenote.
