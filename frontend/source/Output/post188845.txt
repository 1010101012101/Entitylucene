Firefox "not responding", can't force quit, doesn't show in activity monitor <body> I have entered a weird state  Firefox was open. The icon appears in the codecmd+tab/code task menu.  In the dock it shows as "not responding". Force Quit does nothing though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9art.png" alt="enter image description here"  Ok... but then it doesn't show in Activity Monitor either.  I have searched for "Firefox", "fox", "ff", "mozilla" and skimmed through by eye.  I have also tried grepping the output of codeps aux/code and codetop/code in terminal but I can't find it.  I wondered if maybe it wasn't really open and just the dock icon/task switcher were confused, but when I double-click Firefox from the Applications folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKDCM.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have tried relaunching Finder but it doesn't fix anything.  I assume a reboot will fix it, can anyone suggest another avenue?  <answer210118> This is what I answered in a similar question. It did the trick for me.     I had the same problem with NetBeans and this is what worked for me:      codesudo killall launchservicesdbr sudo killall Dock/code      I hope this helps.      I based my answer in this post: Can&#39;t kill Preview app and in previous knowledge.   subCheck my answer here: App crashes, dock icon remains, can&#39;t reboot, yet no process in ps aux to kill./sub  <comment223619> Try quitting "launchservicesd". See [Can't kill Preview app](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188259/cant-kill-preview-app) <comment223624> did you try the "nettop" in terminal to see what is it doing <comment223629> can't see it in `top` or `nettop` <comment223633> quitting (not force quit) `launchservicesd` from Activity Monitor gave me an eternal beachball of death, hard to hard boot the laptop. <comment223634> also sounds same issue http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/176270/app-crashes-dock-icon-remains-cant-reboot-yet-no-process-in-ps-aux-to-kill?rq=1 <comment258946> Whilst this is a useful answer and quoting the content is much preferable to posting a link by itself, it's even more useful if you rather flag the question as a duplicate and provide the link to the duplicate to link the questions. <comment258956> I'll take that into consideration... <comment329268> for me, as a SE user, I find the duplicate flagging significantly more obscure since the link is ABOVE the question - an answer in the answer section is where I look for information.   (and often the "duplicates" are less useful or less directly applicable, often requiring a lot more digging through answers.)   my 2 cents - I upvoted. :)
