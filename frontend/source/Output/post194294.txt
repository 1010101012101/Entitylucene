How to shuffle all songs in iOS 8.4 music app <body> In the old version of the music app you could shuffle all songs when songs were selected:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QAhm6.jpg" width="150"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7n02n.png" width="150"   This feature seems to be absent in iOS 8.4 and the new music app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cs9Eq.jpg" width="150"   hr  h1What are the options for shuffling all my songs in the new version of the music app under iOS 8.4?/h1  <answer194304> ul liIn the My Music tab under the codeRecently Added/code album artwork is a title which by default reads codeArtists/code it is a pink drop down menu./li liSelect codeSongs/code from the list./li liSelect any song to start playback./li liEnable shuffle mode, disable repeat./li /ul  <answer194963> To shuffle all music select Artists, Albums, or Songs, press play on the ear buds  In other modes of play the shuffle is a toggle. It will remember if its on or off. If its on pressing the picture in the Artists list will play all their music shuffled. If shuffle is off it will play all music starting with the most recent album in album order.  The same is true with the Album list. Shuffle on, press the picture, the songs of that album are shuffled. Shuffle off, songs play in album order.  <answer195078> You can also use the command "shuffle music" with siri  <answer195245> The above solutions didn't work for me. What worked for me was after starting a song, I tapped the bottom bar that shows what's playing. Upon tapping, a window with the album cover appears along with the player controls, including the shuffle and repeat buttons.   <answer220580> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ew0nd.png" alt="Music app, scrolled to the top"  Scroll further up the front page of the music app, and there is a "Shuffle All" command hidden there.  <comment232787> @deeksbek did this answer your question? <comment233161> Based on what you asked my solution and the others would work, if you are using iOS 8.4 then it will work. <comment233853> Kind of crap if you're not using Apple's earbuds. <comment234309> @janaspage  if you have a headset you can do it in a public noisy place. <comment238608> For me, if you say "Shuffle music" Siri just says "OK turning shuffle on" but doesn't play music. Then you have to say "Play music" to actually play anything, <comment238610> Although there are workarounds, this is clearly another Apple design flaw. Submit feedback to Apple here: https://feedback.apple.com/ and/or submit a bug report here: https://bugreport.apple.com   See no reason why they should make shuffling music so complicated. <comment243316> "Enable shuffle mode" isn't specific enough!  James Berry's answer says how to do it. <comment243318> @janaspage - did you start from "Songs" or Artist?  I think if you start from a song in Songs, it will shuffle through all, but if you start from a song in the Artist list, it will shuffle that artist. Likewise if you start from a song in an Album, it will shuffle that album. But I'm not really sure. <comment243351> @RandyOrrison There is an icon which is the shuffle icon, you press that. Also James Berrys's answer doesn't necessarily shuffle all songs if you are in a playlist, album or other grouping of music. James Copelands is better but requires a compatible device. Glad you found a solution that works for you however. <comment273043> And doesn't work if there is no photo of the artists - missing from some artists.
