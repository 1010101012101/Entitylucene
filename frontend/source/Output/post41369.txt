App for hi-res frame capture from a webcam <body> I need a simple app to capture single frames from a high-res webcam. Like PhotoBooth, but saves the full resolution of the camera is what I'm looking for.  A similar question was asked here What app to use for high res webcam photo capture? - but I'm looking for an app that just does frame capture, not a more complicated app that does a bunch of other stuff, with the frame capture requiring multiple user steps.  Update: it's for capturing images off a microscope, so live preview of the camera output is essential. Something like Cheese for linux is what I'm looking for.  <answer41374> How about imagesnap. If it's simple you want, then that's a free (with source) command line tool with the following options:  precodeUSAGE: ./imagesnap [options] [filename] Version: 0.2.4 Captures an image from a video device and saves it in a file. If no device is specified, the system default will be used. If no filename is specfied, snapshot.jpg will be used. Supported image types: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, BMP   -h          This help message   -v          Verbose mode   -l          List available video devices   -d device   Use named video device /code/pre  I've just tried it on my 10.7.3 Macbook Pro (early 2011) and it captures images at 1280 x 720 from the built-in camera (which I beleive is its full resolution).  <answer62610> You can use "Capture IT!" (www.toolsfortelevision.com). Latest version is 1.1.3. and it's from 2007. Still, I am using it with Mountain lion and USB UVC film scanner (the same principle as your microscope.  <comment46887> There is also [iSightCapture](http://osxdaily.com/2007/01/24/capture-isight-images-using-the-command-line/) and this looks like it additionally supports options for setting the capture width and height. However, it seems quite old and the links to download it no longer work. <comment46891> Thanks, looks promising. Forgot to mention (updated the question), that I need live preview from the camera. Any thoughts about how to get that? <comment46898> Do you have any idea what the Microscope looks like to the computer device-wise? Is the device listed and functional within Image Capture? <comment46900> Ah, ok. Thats probably a no-go then. I don't know of anything else offhand sorry, but I'll be surprised if there isn't a simple GUI app with a live webcam preview out there! <comment46954> As far as I can tell it's just a USB camera like a webcam - not drivers were required to get it to work. Doesn't show up in Image Capture. Shows up in PhotoBooth, which would be fine, except that PB saves downsampled images
