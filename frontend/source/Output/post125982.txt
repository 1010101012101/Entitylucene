What determines whether 'Warranty' appears in About This Mac? <body> At the foot of the strongAbout This Mac/strong window:   ul lisome Macs show emLicense Agreement/em/li lisome Macs show emLicense and Warranty/em./li /ul  What determines whether the word emWarranty/em appears?   (For someone whose late 2013 Mac Pro 6,1 serial number is listed in their support profile, the word does strongnot/strong appear.)  <answer125988> Are the two spellings of 'license' and 'licence' accurate in your question? The second spelling is usually a British spelling variation, (like labour for labor, aluminium for aluminum, &amp;c.)  I would hazard a guess that the word 'Warrantee' appears because different legal conditions are in effect if this particular Mac/OS X was purchased in the UK.  My iMac, registered with AppleCare and purchased in the the US, does not have 'Warrantee.'  <comment147896> The screenshots that I have seen show *License and Warranty* â€“ thanks for the question. I have edited the opening post.
