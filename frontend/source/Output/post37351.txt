FTP Client with AppleScript support <body> I'm looking for an FTP client with the following requirements.  ul liFile/Folder sync/li liSftp/SSH tunnelling/li listrongOutstanding/strong AppleScript support/li liRuns on Lion/li /ul  The GUI interface is not overly important as it won't be the main interface used, however (and this is subjective) a better interface would be a bonus.  <answer37355> Have you tried Transmit? I think it'll do most of what you need.  <answer37762> At a previous place of employment, we set up Fetch to do consistent uploads via FTP Droplets, and Automated Uploads with it via Applescript. It supports SFTP as well, though I don't remember it being able to actually create SSH tunnels itself.  Free for 15 days, $29 license.  <comment42362> I have, 5 years ago, and I do like Panic's software in general, however my needs have changed over time and I'm looking for opinions/answers on respective levels of functionality.  e.g. What makes the AS support outstanding or are they all the same <comment42363> Unfortunately I don't know what your AS needs are. You might try downloading the latest version of Transmit and open up the AS dictionary in AS Editor. <comment42364> With more effort you can always use `rsync, ssh, scp` <comment42387> In addition to what afragen said, you can download sample Apple Scripts for Transmit from here: http://www.panic.com/transmit/d/Transmit%204%20AppleScript%20Examples.zip <comment42566> @afragen sorry I really don't want to get into shell scripting if I can, it's time I lack. I can write the AS very quickly and let the program do the grunt work of the configuration and transfer handling. <comment42567> @pdd very helpful thanks +1 <comment42852> thanks for the info, very nice automation <comment43154> -1 Question does not show any research effort, if it's answered by a link to Transmit. <comment45325> Why not just run shell script commands to FTP and SFTP from within the AppleScript? <comment45326> That would not be my preferred solution, since it would take me too long to write and maintain, but it is feasible, just not pretty and I'd have to write a lot more script to manage retries etc
