Is it possible to right click an item in finder an "move to" to move a file / folder to another location? <body> Is there a way to get an option when using finder to be able the right click and select "move to", in the same way you can "move to trash". I'd like to be able to move items around my finder this way.   Usually when I've got my laptop connected to a larger monitor I just pull 2 finder windows side by side and drag and drop to organise folders, but it would be really useful when on a smaller laptop screen to be able to do this.   I'm running Yosemite 10.10.5.  <answer272283> I have a strongAutomator/strong emService/em named strongMove Selected Items To....workflow/strong and shows on the emContext Menu/em in strongFinder/strong as strongMove Selected Items To.../strong when emfiles/em and or emfolders/em are selected. I can then choose where to move them to and whether or not to replace existing items.  Here's a picture of the emServices workflow/em and note the settings under emOptions/em for the strongMove Finder Items/strong emaction/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bvzL4.png" alt="Move Selected Items To....workflow picture"  Checking the strongShow this action when the workflow runs/strong check box brings up the strongMove Finder Items/strong emdialog box/em, as shown in the image below, where you can the select where you want to move the emfiles/em/emfolders/em to.  Note that you can change the default strongTo:/strong location from strongDesktop/strong to wherever you'd like and then save the emService/em so it's what you chose as the starting point each time the service is triggered. While not shown in the example picture, I have it set to strongMacintosh HD/strong so when the strongMove Finder Items/strong emdialog box/em appears, I can click the strongMacintosh HD/strong and then strongOther.../strong on the empopup menu/em easily, to bring up the strongChoose/strong emdialog box/em to more quickly navigate to where I want to go.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVazL.png" alt="Move Finder Items dialog box"  You can also assign a emkeyboard short/em to the emService/em in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong  strongServices/strong  strongFiles and Folders/strong. I assigned it: strong^⌥⌘M/strong  hr  Note: When I first saved the strongAutomator/strong emService/em it only showed two dots on the emContext Menu/em, when I expected to see three as that is what I typed in the strongSave service as:/strong emsheet/em. Well, I had to rename it in strongFinder/strong so there were four dots between strongMove Selected Items To/strong and strongworkflow/strong, then save the file again pressing strong⌘S/strong in strongAutomator/strong. This enabled the three dots to show on the emContext Menu/em in strongFinder/strong. Note that if you have more then a few emServices/em it will appear under strongServices/strong on the emContext Menu/em in strongFinder/strong.  I have since found out that had I used four dots in the strongSave service as:/strong emsheet/em, e.g. strongMove Selected Items To..../strong, it would have then shown as strongMove Selected Items To.../strong on the emContext Menu/em without further meddling.  <answer272327> If you select an item &amp; either right click/Copy or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd  kbd C /kbdbr then  kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd V /kbd will Paste to a new location, but kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd V /kbd will Move, as will holding kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd as you right click; you'll see Paste change to Move.  <comment342272> Apple did build in a way to "move item here" but you first have to copy it (to maintain its integrity if anything untoward happens during the process) then use OPT+right click to move the copied item to its destination. <comment342291> Thanks, is there a way to change shot cut keys to say use "Cmd ⌘  Opt ⌥  M" instead of "V" as i think that would be confusing in the long run where you may accidently copy a file as well as move it. Apart from that great solution <comment342292> It's probably better to just remember it as "Paste Special", because Cmd/M is the system wide shortcut for 'Minimise Window' & Cmd/Opt/M is 'Minimise All Windows' - so you'd be fighting a lot of legacy structure to try persuade it to do that. If you forget & Paste instead, you only need to then delete the original.
