Numbers V3: If cell contains a value, convert cell value to X <body> I have a spreadsheet which contains a mixture of text strings and empty cells. I'm looking for a formula to replace the value of all non-empty cells with a single character 'x', while leaving empty cells blank.   <answer166284> Here are a few hints:  ul liuse an auxiliary column;/li liuse functions ISBLANK and IF;/li lireplicate the auxiliary column within the original one;/li liremove the auxiliary column./li /ul  <answer166291> Using Daniel's tips I've come up with this solution:  ol liCreate an auxiliary column/li liAdd the formula:  IF(NOT(ISBLANK(A1)),"x"," ")/li liCopy formula to all rows./li liOverwrite original column with values from auxiliary column./li /ol  This isn't an ideal solution as I need to apply it individually to around 20 different columns. If anyone knows a way to do this without using an auxiliary column I'd be interested to hear it.  <comment194875> Please specify if you want to keep the original values. <comment194876> No need to keep original values. Just convert the string to an X. <comment194879> Please, specify this point within your original question (OQ) and not within comments. Comments are destined to be destroyed. <comment194880> Thanks for the tips Daniel. I'd prefer not to use an auxiliary column if possible as I have around 20 columns that I need to apply the formula to.
