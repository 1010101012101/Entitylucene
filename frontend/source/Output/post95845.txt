Cannot get postfix to listen on wifi interface (en1) <body> I have a Mac running 10.8.4 which I am using as a server which is only connected to my network via Wifi (codeen1/code), however I cannot get the stock codepostfix/code process to listen on codeen1/code.  I have tried a variety of codeinet_interfaces/code settings, for example the default setting of codeall/code, gives:  precode# netstat -an | fgrep .25 tcp6       0      0  ::1.25                 *.*                    LISTEN tcp4       0      0  127.0.0.1.25           *.*                    LISTEN /code/pre  I have also tried:  precodeinet_interfaces = 192.168.1.100, 127.0.0.1 inet_interfaces = 192.168.1.0, 127.0.0.1 inet_interfaces = $myhostname /code/pre  But I can see no listen on codeen1/code.  Can anyone advise?  Should I ditch the stock codepostfix/code and use the Macports one?  (note that I have unloaded and loaded codepostfix/code using codelaunchctl/code between config changes).  <answer95940> OK, long-story-short, there was an additional codeinet_interfaces/code line right at the bottom of the file, which has the setting codeloopback_only/code.  I can only assume it was written there by some automated tool incapable of properly parsing and recreating the config file.  <comment112490> The standard setup of postfix listens on all networks you should not need to set this, How have you setup the postfix daemon in LaunchAgents etc? <comment112492> @Mark Yeah I have used the `launchd` `.plist` provided with the system.  The default `inet_interfaces` setting should work out-of-the-box, however it doesn't.  Perhaps there is something else going on that I'm not aware of with the Mac version?
