What is the real native maximum resolution of mid–2010 iMac's iSight camera? <body> I had understood that the pre-2011 Macs &amp; Apple displays have a built–in iSight camera which sensor is capable of VGA (code640 x 480/code) resolution—unlike the emFaceTime HD/em cameras, which replaced the built–in iSights, that are capable of SXGA (code1280 x 1024/code) resolution.  I had also thought that, when importing feed from the camera to an strongiMovie/strong-project, code640 x 480/code is the native maximum of the camera and the other, WSVGA (code1024 x 576/code), option is upscaled and cropped version of the code640 x 480/code feed.  Moreover, when I open strongPhoto Booth/strong app, I'm stuck with one resolution which is for video code720 x 480/code (DVD (NTSC)) and for pictures code1280 x 853/code.  There is still one more native way to record iSight video: strongQuickTime Player/strong—with which the resolutios are as interesting as follows:  ul liNormal: code640 x 480/code (VGA)/li liHigh: code960 x 720/code/li liMaximum: code1280 x 1024/code (SXGA)/li /ul  This made me suspicious: it says emmaximum/em but the resolution is over 4 times what I had thought the max was.  Now: strongwhat is the real native maximum resolution that the/strong (mid–2010 27" iMac's) strongbuilt–in iSight camera is capable of?/strong What is real and what is upscaled?sup*/sup  If there are no emdefinite &amp; reliable/em specifications available, is there a way to confirm it by myself? Judging by  the lack of moiré pattern and other overall fidelity of the SXGA video recorded by QuickTime Player, it seems to me that it is emnot/em an upscale of the VGA feed.  Wikipedia's entry concentrates on the external iSight camera, and while it has a chapter on the built–in version, but, as of today and like the product entries in Wikipedia, it doesn't refer to any working sources.  sub*) Upscaled emand cropped/em in case of non–4:3 resolutions—the CMOS sensors have almost definitely an aspect ratio of 4:3. /sub  <answer22257> I think it's 1280x1024, as that's what the LED backlit MacBook Pro's and onwards used. The Lion version of Photo Booth uses the max resolution and crops it.   720x480 is actually a standard resolution - it's what most DVD's use.  <answer25957> Some discussion sources report that using QuickTime video capture at the stated emmaximum/em quality. That would hint my built-in iSight's resolution is in fact 1280&times;1024.  Moreover, the iSight upgrade (from 0.3 to 1.3 megapixels) has been noted first at Mac Daddy World and later re-reported at TUAW and Engadget:  ul liThe product ID for the 0.3 MP iSight is code0x8501/code and its vendor is codeMicron/code…/li li…while the 1.3 MP iSight's product ID is code0x850strong2/strong/code and the vendor is codeApple/code./li /ul  Looking at my System information report, I can confirm the product ID is code0x8502/code.  So, summa summarum: strongmid–2010 iMac's built-in iSight camera has a native resolution of 1280&times;1024 pixels./strong  <comment24628> (About the standards: oh yes, I erroneously looked at a non-all-inclusive-list, sorry 'bout that!) <comment24704> Sadly, the IORegistryExplorer doesn't have any device capabilities listed, so the only other tool to grab a raw video stream is [QuartzComposer](http://developer.apple.com/graphicsimaging/quartzcomposer/) (part of Xcode) - It has a nice VideoFeedback.qtz project showing how the apps might use quartz to downsample different camera resolutions to the "standard". Have you read [this discussion](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2293095?start=0&tstart=0) on speculation why video is down sampled?
