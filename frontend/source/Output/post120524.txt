Mavericks - set-up for multiple screens <body> At work I use a MacBook Pro in combination with a Thunderbolt Display. I use the laptop screen as secondary screen while I work on the large display.  I updated my OS last week and am now using Mavericks which is designed to allow for more flexibility using two screens. However, I experience one thing which I did like better before.   While I work on the Thunderbolt display I usually have outlook open on the secondary screen. When a mail comes that I want to read or when I want to reply to a mail it now opens on the laptop screen / same screen.   I'd like the mail or the reply window on the main screen like it used to but I haven't found a way to change this. Is there an option to do that in outlook or the general settings?
