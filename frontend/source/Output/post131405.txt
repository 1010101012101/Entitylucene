How to allow a different user to execute graphical applications <body> I am trying to find a way to su to a user and run a graphical applications (My goal is to run another instance of google drive but for now - just running any application would be fine). I am basically looking for an equivalent of xhost + from Linux.  Currently when I try running iTerm for example as a different user I get:  precodeFAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer /code/pre  So how can I accomplish this?  <comment154340> What's the full command you're running that leads to that error message? <comment154341> Thanks, for example: sudo su - differentuser -c "/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm" Password: ... _RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL. <comment154343> See the duplicate question for the syntax. You want to use target `/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm` for the `sudo` call to start iTerm as another user.
