how to move and merge folders in OSX Mavericks? <body> I have 2 subfolders (which in itself contains many subfolders) in my main folder.  e.g.  precodemain folder == subfolder1 ==== folder1 ==== folder2 == subfolder2 ==== folder1 ==== folder3 ==== folder4 /code/pre  some things in subfolder2 are already in subfolder1. If I drag and drop subfolder2 into subfolder1, it will ask me to replace existing subfolders thus losing things. The only way to merge the folders that I know of is to press the option key. But this only makes a copy. This still requires me to delete the unneeded folder.  I want to move subfolder2 into subfolder1 and merge their contents. How can I do it? Thanks much :)  <answer130344> h11 Quick answer/h1  h3Enter this command in Terminal:br/h3  codecp -r -n ./srcFolder/ ./targetFolder//code br Remove the code-n/code if you want to overwrite duplicates.  strongUpdate:/strongbr codeditto source target/code will also do the trick.  Files in source folder overwrite any duplicates in target folder.

If you're merging two folders that don't have any duplicate files between them, you will see the merge option if you hold the option key. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LBY7S.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, if the folders you're merging contain any files with the same name, the merge option won't show up. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dntm.png" alt="If folders contain any duplicate items"  In that case, you basically have two options:  ol liuse the command line or/li limanually remove duplicates, then click &amp; drag + hold option to merge./li /ol  <comment171995> I'd love to know who made this so difficult to carry out :-( <comment172136> Oh man. Me too. This is weird. <comment224313> Just for kicks I made a script that does this, and then deletes the folder using a trash function I have. `merge() {     echo "Merging $(basename $1) into $(basename $2)";     ditto $@;     trash $1;   }`
