Locating the iBooks folder in iCloud Drive <body> I'm using iCloud drive to sync my e-books via the iBooks app.  I noticed that the synced files show up in the All My Files view.  I tried to find out their exact location, it seems to be iCloud Drive / iBooks (via kbdCmd/kbd+kbdI/kbd) but when I try to navigate there from iCloud Drive, the iBooks folder doesn't show up, even when I turn hidden files on.  Is that a bug or how come this behaviour?
