Failed bootcamp partition, now can't remove it <body> Tried to set up Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro 15" (Mid 2014). Running El Capitan 10.11.3. Windows refused to install (GPT partition only problem?). I followed steps elsewhere to remove and reformat the partition to ExFAT then try and format again through the Windows installer, but this was unsuccessful.  I scrapped the idea and tried to go to Disk Utility to remove the partition. However, if I try to erase the 'Windows' partition (now called Bootcamp), it simply asks me to make another. I can't seem to merge it with the existing Macintosh HD partition?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/60fnN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now for the stupid, require telling off part: I didn't create a backup prior to this, and I think my recovery partition is ****ed.  Is my only solution to do the internet restore and start from scratch?  strongEDIT:/strong To clarify, Disk Utility says the volume is functional and I can indeed store stuff there. I just don't want it!

If this fails, then commands can be entered in a Terminal application window to remove the partition. I will not post these commands unless necessary.  <comment286342> There is no indication that either your OS X 10.11 El Capitan partition or your Recovery partition is damaged. Why do you think so? The Disk Utility normally does not show the Recovery Partition. <comment286358> Thanks @Eimisas. I get to "The volume (name of the volume) appears to be OK" for dev/rdisk0s2, but I believe the volume in question is rdisk0s4. Any idea how I can check that one? <comment286361> @David Anderson Long story short, I initially had Win 10 working and tried to expand the volume using CampTune. It couldn't find a recovery partition, nor could I create one using [this](http://musings.silvertooth.us/downloads-2/). Since I couldn't get it working, I formatted the volume leaving the result here. <comment286481> If you format the BOOTCAMP partition as MS-DOS (FAT), then you should be able to use the Boot Camp Assistant application to remove the partition.

Managed to reattempt with success so Windows is also now installed. <comment286656> Ok, then I will post my comment as an answer.
