Disable iTunes 11 arrows <body> Is there any way to remove these arrows from the songs list? I know they only appear on hover but are still annoying. I always hit them accidentaly when trying to play a song.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R0bpm.png" alt="A wild iTunes arrow appears"  <answer131845> This is no longer possible. There used to be a way to disable them (iTunes 10 and earlier), but the ability was removed in iTunes version 11.
