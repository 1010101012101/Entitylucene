What iOS app displays ToDos/Reminders in the Notification Center? <body> I need a tasklist/ToDo/Reminders app that lists out my current tasks in the notification center.  I know that Reminders will if I add a time or alarm (I won't want this).  I know Things can if I jailbreak (I don't want to).  I just want a list of things I need to remember to do, right there on the Notifications page.  <answer75078> Catch Notes or Memo Board are the only ones I know of that will stay after the alarm has passed.
