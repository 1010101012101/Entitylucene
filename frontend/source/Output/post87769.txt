Searching for punctuation in Preview <body> In Preview (v 5.3 on 10.6.8), if I search for a single letter such as codek/code in a pdf, the program will find and highlight every instance of that letter in the pdf.  However, if I search for a punctuation mark such as code?/code or code;/code, it will report codeFound on 0 pages/code, even when the document is littered with such punctuation.  How can I get preview to search for punctuation?   The reason for this is that I wish to locate all instances of missing references (denoted as code[?]/code) in a pdf output from codeLaTeX/code.  (Yes, I know that codeLaTeX/code will tell me where they are in the source file, but I wish to find them in the pdf.)  <answer155451> A year late but may help others:  For me escaping it in double bracket works so try searching code":"/code or code"?"/code.  Escaping in double quotes searches for whatever is between the quotes similar to the way google does their search options.  <answer256347> Does it have to be in Preview?  Preview doesn't seem to have this functionality as of El Capitan (10.11).  However, I have found and tested two ways that you can search PDF files for punctuation.    ol liAcrobat Reader/li licodepdfgrep/code/li /ol  h3Acrobat Reader/h3  Using Adobe Acrobat, I simply entered the punctuation into the search field in this case a colon (:) and Acrobat found all instances of it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/27t59.png" alt="Sample PDF Page"  emNote:  I did successfully test out the question mark (?) and it worked.  Unfortunately, the only document I had at the ready had personal info on it so I couldn't use it as an example.  However, I made sure to test different punctuation from periods, exclamation points, question marks, commas, etc. and all worked./em  h3codepdfgrep/code/h3  pdfgrep is the PDF equivalent to the command line (CLI) utility codegrep/code.  The useage is simple:  codepdfgrep [OPTIONS] PATTERN FILE/code  So, to search for a comma, and have it tell you what page number it occurs on, simply issue the command:  codepdfgrep -n "?" foobar.pdf/code  codepdfgrep/code is FOSS software and available on Homebrew and MacPorts.  See codeman pdfgrep/code for more info.  <comment102652> Can you search for `[?]` instead? <comment102655> No that doesn't work either... In fact if I search for `[?] d` it will find all locations of `d` and completely ignore the punctuation. I think punctuation is being stripped before the search. Probably nothing I can do about it. <comment318725> Double brackets don't seem to work for the OP's problem whatever is stated inside square brackets are taken as sets of items.
