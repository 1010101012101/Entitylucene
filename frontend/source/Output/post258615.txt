Seeing missed/incoming call updates made on old phone on new iPhone and how to disconnect iMessages from old phone <body> I wonder if you can help me.   My one problem has been solved - saw response to someone else and tried it. :) Second issue, my call list is still updating/including calls made/missed on my old iPhone which my mom is now using and we are currently in different countries.   How can I change this? Earlier i talked her through reseting all settings but Im not sure if that helped coz I can see the call list again now.   Thanks.
