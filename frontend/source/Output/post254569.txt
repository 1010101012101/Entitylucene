A Way to Save Desktop Layouts with Multiple Presets <body> Anyone know if there's an app that will not just let you save window positions for multi-display setups, but also create presets for different situations?    For example  Client A (saved as a preset) -all windows open and size to saved positions -different finder windows open to specific folders and views -browser open to specific tabs at specific addresses -terminal opens up directly to desired directory etc...  Client B (saved as a preset) -same idea but maybe different programs, finder locations, etc..  I took a look at "Stay" but it doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for.  Also, I'm using El Capitan.  Anything like this out there?  <answer254571> I can recommend Moom. You can have different presets for different display configurations.  <comment317175> So far it seems pretty cool, but I don't think it will open any applications for you, is that correct?  I'm sort of looking for this, but also a way to automate opening a series of applications, with finder navigating directly so specific folders
