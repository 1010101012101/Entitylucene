Remove Prolog from MacOS <body> I have a MacBookPro with macOS Sierra v.10.12.1.  I downloaded gprolog from this link and installed this using MacPorts.   Now, given that Prolog does not work like I wanted, I decided to remove it, but I don't know how.  I tried to remove it using Homebrew, running:  precode:~ dario$ brew remove gprolog /code/pre  but this gives me  precodeError: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/gprolog /code/pre  If I run codegprolog/code command in terminal, it gives me   precode-bash: gprolog: command not found  /code/pre  The only way I have to run gprolog is writing codegprolog/code in Spotlight and clicking on gprolog's icon. I also tried to run codewhich gprolog/code and codewhereis gprolog/code, without any results.  How can I uninstall gprolog from my Mac?   <answer264517> You say you installed it using MacPorts but you tried to uninstall it using Homebrew? Homebrew has no knowledge that you installed it using MacPorts. Use MacPorts to uninstall:  precodeport uninstall gprolog /code/pre  If that's not the case, you can manually remove the following files instead:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kkwfY.png" width="187"  <comment331498> *"installs GNU Prolog in /opt/local/ and /opt/local/bin"* (from the download link) â€“ you should look there. <comment331499> I am an old Linux user, so I'm awkward on mac <comment331500> Could I remove the folders containing gprolog without negative effects? <comment331504> I uninstall it removing all these folders and my Mac is now clean!
