Run script for delete HD <body> Is there a way to run a script on a Mac that literally will do  ( sudo rm -rf / )?  I need to schedule a complete wipe of my hard drive on next Friday at 6PM.  I'm not very familiar with scripts so there's no clear answer for me.  Can I run a script that doesn't involve me to grant the emsudo/em password?  I do have my root user password.  <answer251027> You can probably do this in a script- if you can do it on the command line then you can do it in a script, too. But it seems messy- not sure how much will actually get erased before the system just hangs. Wonder what will be left behind.  I'm curious what problem you're trying to solve here (other than erasing a disk at a specified time)... Are you reinstalling an OS when you're done? If you can setup a NetBoot server then you can create a NetInstall or NetRestore image that will auto-erase a specific volume name.  Another idea is to just delete the user account, assuming the data you're concerned about is contained within the user's home directory.  <answer251032> Just create a launch daemon with   precodesudo touch /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist /code/pre  Open an editor:  precodesudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist /code/pre  and edit in the following content :  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;user.local.rm&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/bin/rm&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-rf&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;18&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;00&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Weekday&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;5&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Load the launch daemon with:  precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist /code/pre  This will remove almost any file and folder of your internal disk strongnext/strong friday. My virtual machine stopped working with an empty root folder and (according to the status bar) ~6 GB of disk space occupied. Finally it may be less though and the "6 GB" was just the last reportable value.  strongThis will not erase (=overwrite with random data) your files and folders completely: any decent data recovery tool will probably restore almost all previous content./strong   strongIn El Capitan this only works if SIP is disabled!/strong  <answer251039> Same answer as strongklanomath/strong.  If you're paranoid, you could replace coderm/code by codesrm/code for a secure remove but it can take a lot of extra-time.   In the strongklanomath/strong code.plist/code file, you can write:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/srm&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-r&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-m&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  <comment311962> What version of OS X was in the VM and if 10.11 was SIP enabled? <comment311963> @user3439894 It was 10.11 and SIP was disabled! <comment311964> `srm` doesn't work. I have tested it. With `srm` you can only delete distinctive files and globbing (like `srm ... /*.*`) in the launch daemon doesn't work. <comment311965> Additionally the path to srm is /usr/bin/srm! <comment311986> `srm your_folder_path` doesn't work but, as I wrote it, you must add the `-r` for recursive. It works on my side. <comment312308> with crontab maybe : mv etc/fstab/ /etc/fstab.bak; shutdown -t5 -h now  that will work? gosh i reaaaally need to lookup somewhere to learn how to script lol
