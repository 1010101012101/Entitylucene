iOS weather widget that displays two locations <body> Is there an iOS weather widget (for the lock screen) that displays the forecast for two locations at the same time? I'd like to be able to see the weather at home and at my work at a glance. I live in Oakland and work in San Francisco, which are close to each other but have significantly different microclimates.  It should show at least today's forecasted high, low, and precipitation.   (I'm aware that I can download multiple apps and use a different app's widget for each location, but i'd like to use the same app for both locations)
