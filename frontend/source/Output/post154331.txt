Changing iPhone backup location <body> When I try to follow the procedure laid out in Backup iPhone to external drive on Mac and run  precodeln -s /Volumes/DriveName/Backup/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/MobileSync/Backup /code/pre  to change the backup location for my iPad and iPhone terminal tells me that the file directory doesn't exist... what am I missing?  <answer154334> You need to replace the codeDriveName/code part with the name of your external drive. One way to find the name is to run  precodels -l /Volumes /code/pre  in Terminal.  <answer154335> The path you provide must exist. In this case, code/Volumes/DriveName/Backup//code must exist and be writable.  <comment181590> I did that... Seagate Exp is my ext drive name and i replaced DRIVENAME with "Seagate Exp" and get the same result... other thoughts? <comment181592> That would be `Seagate\ Exp` in this case (to take care of the space character). If this isn't the issue, can you please add the full error message you get *directly to the question*?
