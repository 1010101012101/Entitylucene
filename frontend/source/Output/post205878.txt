Why does WhatsApp require so much space for iCloud backup? <body> When backing up Whatsapp History to iCloud, Whatsapp required nearly the same amount of free space as the total backup. i.e If Whatsapp need to back up 1.8 GB of data to iCloud it will need 1.8GB of free space on the iPhone.  Is there anyway to get around that? I simply dont constantly have 1.8GB of free space.  <answer205879> I would be more worried if the backup of my data takes emless/em space than the data itself. If you want to reduce the size of the backup (and the data), start with deleting videos and pictures contained in WhatsApp conversations.   <comment248386> Well that's because I already have most of it backed up previously. Assuming a Total Backup of 1.8GB, I am pretty sure at least 1.6GB of those are the same as my previous backup. The WhatsApp iPhone version requires lots of free space for this to work. <comment248387> The iCloud backup of WhatsApp is a 1:1 copy of the data available in the app on your phone, it will always have the same size as the app data. Are you more worried about the size of the backup or about the data volume transferred during backup? <comment281329> WhatsApp will compress the data before sending to iCloud. The compression ratio is around 80% of original size. <comment281333> @raptor The compression ratio depends on the number of images in your WhatsApp chats... <comment281335> @patrix agree. texts have better compression than images.
