What are good travel game apps for iPad to entertain a 2-3 year old <body> My wife is to face a 2h flight with our very active daughter and would like to prepare some distractions.  Specifically we are looking for very simple, entertaining games a toddler can handle. We already have "Memory" and she really enjoys it.  It should be as colorful as it can get and interactive where swiping and touching a thing is the most sophisticated gesture she can handle. Doesn't really have to have a goal, just do stuff.  <answer31831> This is an iPhone app, but will work on iPad, It is a game made for toddlers.   http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/bubbles  <answer31839> There are a lot of apps for children. You can find some decent apps here and here, or just by using the terms "iPad app Children" in Google :-)br Enjoy you flight!  <comment36496> Ok I found some more on the second page. Thanks. <comment36626> Ended up buying the painting app, thanks. <comment36627> Goodluck with the flight and the children! :-)
