How to disable Chrome/Safari notifications on multiple devices <body> I have a macbook, iPad and two iPhones (one is mine, second - my wife's). All of them are connected to the same iCloud/apple account. Now, after last updates (starting from iOS 9), once my wife open some page at Chrome/Safari on her iPhone, I receive notifications at my macbook (some app icon at the left side of Dock menu). Moreover, after installing 9.0.3 on iPhone, once I open some page at Chrome/Safari on my macbook, she receives the notification at her iPhone..   The question is - how can I disable it? Is there some option that disables only this feature without disconnecting the whole device from apple/iCloud account?  <answer208590> This sounds like emHandoff/em. Handoff lets you continue an action you start on one device on a different one (e.g. browsing a webpage).   If not already, you have to disable it on every device.
