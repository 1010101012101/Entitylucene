Copy the 'explicit' or 'E' symbol from songs in the iOS Music app <body> I have songs in my Music app that are marked as 'explicit'.  Is there a way to copy this 'explicit'/'E' symbol so I can use it somewhere else?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vl0dqm.png" alt="explicit"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rpyPg.jpg" alt="explicit second"  <answer189102> h1The 'E' is not text, it is artwork./h1  iTunes on your Mac has the same artwork. This artwork is located within the iTunes app. This is how you can find it:  ul liGo to /Applications/li liRight click 'iTunes' and select 'Show Package Contents'/li liNow go to 'Contents' - 'Resources' - 'English' (or any other installed language)/li liIn here you will find the artwork in png format. The 'ViewLineItemRatingE' is the one you are looking for. The @2x suffix means that it is double the resolution and is meant for retina displays./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkB9m.png" alt="explicit small"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K4ZHl.png" alt="explicit large"  emNote: I do not know about copy rights on this artwork. This might differ between countries as well./em  <answer189108> He is probably looking for the following unicode character : ️Negative Squared Latin Capital Letter E  The letter :    NB: The letter is not visible on my Windows. My iPhone displays it.   <comment224070> If only I can show you a photo, okay so you k ow when you are listening to a song right? And the song is explicit, has curse words. So itunes adds an explicit tag next to the song title. <comment224072> I need a way to copy and paste the "E" next to the title. <comment224080> @CousinCocaine I need it in text every time I try to add it into the song title for my other music app it just says "explicit small" <comment224081> It is not text. It is a PNG. <comment224082> I really need it in text <comment224083> it doesn't exist 'in text' it's a picture. <comment224084> It's an image, there is *no* text. <comment224085> It is not text, it is an image. <comment224093> Do you see the other picture @CousinCocaine <comment224094> ? I put it up here. Yes I have seen it. You start to get a bit annoying. The 'E' symbol looks like text, but it is an image. <comment224095> Alright thanks for the help. Much appreciated. <comment224096> Yes! Of course! But how am I able to copy it in text? <comment224097> You can't copy it from the app. But you can do it from here :) <comment224101> Sorry but from where? <comment224102> I am on a phone <comment224103> You can also get it from Character Table on your Mac. Press `⌘`+`⌃`+`Space` and search for "Negative Squared" - You'll get more squared symbols there. <comment224104> I'm on my iPhone I'm sorry if I did not mention it before <comment224105> On my phone it's just a square <comment224107> Can I have it in a square? <comment224108> There's another one related to that one that it without rounded edges <comment224109> Which iOS version ? <comment224110> 8.2 Is what I am on <comment224112> http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/font/segoe_ui_emoji/index.htm This is the one I mean <comment224113> Have you found out how I am able to copy it on iOS 8.2 <comment224115> Are you there? I don't know I've been trying to look this whole time. <comment224119> There is no character white rounded edges. Like said above, the one with rounded edges is an image. <comment224226> jynx, jynx, jynx. can't argue with right though. Moving forward, If you can't find something similar in the comprehensive http://unicode-table.com I'll eat my  <comment224279> Yep, still couldent find it @ProductionValues
