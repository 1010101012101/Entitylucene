iPhone 4S iOS 6.1.2 Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Add New Shortcut not case sensitive <body> My custom shortcuts are strongnot/strong case sensitive (the opposite was claimed here).br Example:br Under Settings - General - Keyboard - Add New Shortcutbr I specify:br ME : Schorschbr Unfortunately, both codeME/code and codeme/code in the text will be replaced with codeSchorsch/code. Clearly, the custom shortcut is not case sensitive.br How/where can I fix this?  <answer84575> It's not the strongShortcut/strong which is case sensitive, but the strongPhrase/strong. And I don't think making the shortcut so is possible. And here's a reason why. If you enter in the emphrase/em section a sentence, or a word, in lowercase, the way you use the emshortcut/em will define the way the phrase will appear. Lets clarify this a bit.  Having the shortcut codeme: whatever/code, writing codeMe/code will be replaced with codeWhatever/code, and writing codeME/code will be replaced with codeWHATEVER/code, and, of course, codeme/code with codewhatever/code.   This won't work if you've used any capitals in the phrase section, which, therefore, makes a point.  <comment100765> I cannot confirm that writing ``Me``, ``me`` or ``ME`` makes any difference. <comment100785> I tested my self and it works as I said.
