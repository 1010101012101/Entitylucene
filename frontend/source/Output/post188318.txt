Terminal command "ls" in AppleScript list <body> How can I create a list in AppleScript that shows the results of a terminal command. For example codels /Applications//code Every application should be shown in the list, so that I can choose an item from the list.  <answer188325> No need to run a terminal command to do this.  Applescript can handle it without the need of a terminal command.    precodeset myList to {} tell application "Finder"     set fileList to name of files of folder "Applications" of startup disk     repeat with currentFile in fileList         copy currentFile to the end of myList     end repeat end tell choose from list myList /code/pre  Setting a terminal command to a variable can be done as followed:  precodeset myVar to do shell script "ls /Applications" /code/pre  <comment222903> Why downvotes? Seems to be a valid question. <comment222904> The OP asks for `ls` as an example. Can all shell commands be invoked like this? <comment222941> Can folders be shown too? And how can I change the place with a POSIX path? <comment224527> @user121028 Like this:   set fileList to name of files of ((POSIX file "/Applications/Utilities/") as alias)
