How to keep both Mavericks menu bars opaque in two monitor setup <body> Mavericks shows the menu bar in both monitors when you have two. That's great, but the menu bar in the passive desktop turns translucent, which is a bit annoying. Is there a way to keep both menu bars opaque at all times? Setting the menu bar opaque in the desktop settings affects only the active monitor.  <answer110015> I just found a fix for this. Check out this video I made.  Step 1. change the order your displays are in.  Step 2. set to opaque.  Step 3. change back the order, now you have opaque on both bars.  <answer116070> you really can't do this but you can:  hide the second display's menu bar by going into SysPref - Mission Control- and uncheck Displays have separate Spaces.  I'm sure there will be an update soon enough that allows you to dedicate one display as your Control display, for lack of a better term.  ... in researching this tho I did find a neat app called bartender which cleans up your bar.  not free and I'm not linking it cause I have no interest in the company at all, but I am giving the trial mode a shot right now.  Good Luck  <comment129648> Ahh I misread your poste. My fix is only to set both opaque. It still does that weird thing when focus in one display the bar in dimmed in the other.
