Skype crash in Mac OS X 10.8.3 <body> I am facing the problem on the login of skype, I've searched on the Skype site and found this link.  However, I'm not able to figure out what causes this issue.   I'm using Mac OS X 10.8.3  Here is the link for the crash report.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lwLOs.png" alt="Crash Screen shot"  strongUpdate/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mfugw.png" alt="This alert also getting additional information"  strongSince your report shows crash in Thread 0, it might have to do with some other application is garbing all ports. Disable all programs specially if you using VMware, Parallels, or VirtualBox to see if the problem is there. â€“ Borderline 8 mins ago/strong  Based On the above comment :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qbWYt.png" alt="Screen 1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W1VdV.png" alt="Screen 2"  <answer86404> I see you found the problem being the call recorder :) I assume skype is looking for it, and it gets refused.  Kill that application, and if you want a new recorder try this one.  http://www.kandasoft.com/kanda-apps/callnote/  <answer89219> Skype stopped launching for me on Mac 10.8.3  and I tried reinstalling, deleting library skype files to no avail. But then after starting in safe mode ( power down, start, hold down shift key until apple and gear wheel appear) Skype worked perfectly and continues to do so after normal restart.  <comment99764> Welcome to this site!

Kill it and try this one:  http://www.kandasoft.com/kanda-apps/callnote/ <comment100557> How are you supposed to kill the call recorder if the program quits immediately every time?! <comment100559> @JoelHuggins It's Skype which is crashing and CallRecorder seems to be the culprit. So killing CallRecorder should allow you to run Skype again. <comment104631> Welcome, and thank you for sharing :)
