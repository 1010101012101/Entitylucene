Can't disable csrutil <body> I want to disable SIP with the command codecsrutil disable/code on my OS X 10.11.5. I tried it many times, got in the recovery mode and typed in codecsrutil disable/code. I got the message:      Successfully disabled System Integrity Problem. Please restart the machine for the changes take effect   Everytime after restarting, codecsrutil status/code doesn't change. It's still enabled.  I actually tried it in recovery mode with code/usr/bin/csrutil disable/code always the same and after restart it's enabled again..  BTW: if you need outputs of the commands, tell me!  <comment299089> Have you tried resetting the NVRAM? Sometimes the settings could get corrupted. <comment299113> @IronCraftMan Yes I reset it now 2 times, and after that I enter 'csrutil clear' also and reboot many times again. But it seems to stay enabled ..
