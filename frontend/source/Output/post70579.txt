What is the preferred method of command line domain name lookup (DNS)? <body> What command line command do I use to lookup a domain address?  When looking at the man pages for nslookup and dig I can see a section saying that these utilities do not use the Mac OS methods of finding names.  So, what command should I be running?  <answer70580> Either command works fine.  Just because it's not using OS X's methods doesn't mean that it doesn't work.  If you want to use "OS X methods" may I recommend Network Utility?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/klddi.png" alt="enter image description here"  This may still call whois and just display it in the window.  <answer70583> codenslookup/code, codehost/code, and codedig/code are perfectly good DNS query tools in OS X, but they all query DNS directly rather than going through OS X's internal resolution system. As a result, they don't check the /etc/hosts file, or resolve Bonjour/mDNS names (those ending in .local). The standard (quick 'n dirty) way to test resolution is to use codeping/code, since it'll resolve the address you give it through the usual system before attempting to ping it. If you want something intended for the purpose, use codedscacheutil/code instead:  precode$ dscacheutil -q host -a name www.apple.com name: e3191.c.akamaiedge.net alias: www.apple.com www.isg-apple.com.akadns.net www.apple.com.edgekey.net  ip_address: 184.24.141.15  $ ping www.apple.com PING e3191.c.akamaiedge.net (184.24.141.15): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 184.24.141.15: icmp_seq=0 ttl=57 time=57.258 ms ^C --- e3191.c.akamaiedge.net ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 57.258/57.258/57.258/0.000 ms /code/pre  <comment263773> Kudos. I've filed a Radar that the manpages should be clearer on this: http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5038477976535040 <comment343165> One issue with using dscacheutil for lookups is that if it cannot resolve a hostname it doesn't exit with a non-zero return code like host does. <comment343193> To overcome the lack of useful return codes I've created a most basic shell script to supplement the standard 'host' command.  `#!/usr/bin/env bash STAT=1 LOOKUPRESULT="$(dscacheutil -q host -a name "$1")" if [ -z "$LOOKUPRESULT" ] ; then  exit "$STAT" else  echo "$LOOKUPRESULT"  STAT=0  exit "$STAT" fi` <comment356305> I guess this doesn't work for `.local` addresses, does it?
