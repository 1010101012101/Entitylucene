Jailbreak and iOS 'hardware encrypted' data <body> My understanding of reading apple security document below http://images.apple.com/ipad/business/pdf/iPad_Security_Overview.pdf  is that using iphone4s or ipad3,   and setting a complex passcode,   the data on the iPhone/ipad is encrypted when iphone/ipad is locked.  If iPhone/ipad is jailbroken, does it mean the original data is lost ?  <answer62517> There are two partitions on all iOS devices. One is for the system, other is for the data. Jailbreaking only affects the System partition. So jailbreaking doesn’t affect your data.  <comment72212> is data on 'data partition' encrypted and cannot be accessed by the jailbroken system ? <comment72213> If the jailbroken system asks for your passcode while unlocking, then you can access your data. By the way, can you give a little context on the problem? I can’t see how you could’ve arrived in a situation like this. <comment72215> i'm just wondering whether jailbreaking (without supplying passcode while jailbreaking) can bypass ipad3/iphone4s passcode-locked system and access all data (which is supposedly encrypted by the passcode). can it? <comment72222> Nope. As I said, it doesn’t modify the data partition, which is encrypted.
