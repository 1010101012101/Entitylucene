Why does my MacBook Pro (mid 2010) not boot OS X 10.9.2? <body> My MacBook Pro mid 2010 does not boot anymore from the HDD with installed OS X 10.9.2.  I came across this solution which is clearing the NVRAM, but my Mac keeps showing the Apple logo and a spinning wheel.  Are there any other ways to fix this?  <comment229431> What were you doing prior to having this issue? <comment229434> I changed to an ssd before but stopped working under yosemite. Then I put back this old hdd but wont work anymore <comment229435> Are you certain that the SATA plug is firmly connected to the HDD? <comment229437> Start MBP in verbose mode: Cmd+V, as listed [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201573), and please provide the output. <comment229438> @MatteoGuarnerio mac keeps showing the applelogo and spinning wheel after cmd+v <comment229439> Have you already tried all the proposed solutions listed [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203176) (e.g. Safe mode and Disk Utility). Is listed your HDD in Disk Utility? <comment229440> The disk is listed in disk utility, when trying to repair disk, I got unable to unmount disk error <comment229473> I'm betting on the cabling. <comment230648> I replaced the cable and it is fine now
