What is the meaning of the "§" symbol (on the upper left corner of the mac keyboard)? <body> The title says it all, but I'll repeat it here:  What is the meaning of the "§" symbol (on the upper left corner of the mac keyboard) as highlighted  in the image here?  Apparently, this is not printed on mac keyboards sold in the US, though it is on models sold in Europe (or Israel, in my case).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aOQYU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer176971> "§" is the section sign, as answered by @Lizzan.  Excerpt from Wikipedia:     The section sign (§) is a typographical character used mainly to refer to a particular section of a document, such as a legal code. It is also called "double S" and "sectional symbol".br   It is also sometimes used to link to a footnote where the asterisk (*) is already in use on a given page.    <answer199650> It's a Section sign, and is used in Minecraft for color formatting codes.  <comment209153> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign <comment209154> @Lizzan , shall put this as the answer or would you like to? <comment209155> Go for it, I don't have the time to write a full answer right now. :) <comment209640> On the standard US keyboard, this character is at Option - 6 <comment246260> It's also the Simleons sign ;P <comment270732> @rolin It's similar to, but not the same as the simoleon symbol.  Notably, the simoleon's graphic design has a normal circle at the center, not a pair of conjoined curves. <comment369572> does anyone know how to change this key to write "back quote" (`) programmatically?
