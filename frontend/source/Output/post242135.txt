/Users folder (and any other high level folder) missing when trying to attach files to gmail <body> When trying to attach a file located in /Users/"user"/ dir to a gmail email, the /Users/ folder doesn't exist, and there is no top level directory (i.e. /) for me to navigate to.  The workaround is that I am forced to copy the file to one of my "favorites" folders so that I can actually choose the file.  Verified this issue does not occur within the Finder app, however also verified that Windows does not have this problem.  <answer242270> Found the solution.  At the top of the little "pop down" window that shows your files to attach, I had to click on the drop down box (where it currently shows "Documents") to choose a different directory:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6GQKa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment297678> Please help me understand this. How are you trying to get to /? Which application are you using. <comment297686> Can you post a screenshot?
