Terminal: List only and specifically, the 5th file in a directory <body> I am wondering if there is a Terminal command which will specifically list the 5th file in a directory. I was initially using the codels | head -5/code command to complete this, however it listed all other files as well as the fifth, an action which is undesirable for the purpose i have in mind for the proposed command.  Thanks in advance.  <answer208203> In addition to codehead/code, use the codetail/code command:  precodels | head -5 | tail -n 1 /code/pre  where the code-n 1/code argument displays the last line of the input.   For more info on the command, type codeman tail/code in Terminal.
