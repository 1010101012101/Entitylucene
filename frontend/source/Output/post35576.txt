Character Picker stopped working in OS X Lion <body> Character picker inexplicably stopped working tonight in OS X Lion.  I was trying to type in Spanish but now the keys which used to accept tildes or accents are merely repeating.  I tried entering the following command in Terminal and restarting my MacBook Air, but it didn't restore the Character Picker:  codedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool TRUE/code  I also checked which keyboard I am using for input.  I am still using the U.S. keyboard, and that hasn't changed.  I tried logging out, restarting, and shutting down.  Is there anything else I can do to restore Character Picker?  <answer35579> You can try disabling it.    precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool FALSE /code/pre  Then reboot. If you want to reverse this change, you can enter the following to change the feature back to be enabled.  precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool TRUE /code/pre
