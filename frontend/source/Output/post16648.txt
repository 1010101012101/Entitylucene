What is this app called? <body> the app in the dock (right of Safari) apparently shows the network speeds in the dock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/foXOC.png" alt="The app in question is the second one from the left"  Does anyone know what the app is called? There are more images of the app in the blog post at link  Thanks  <answer16649> The app is Transmission.     Transmission is a cross-platform BitTorrent client that is Open Source, Easy, Lean, Native and Powerful.   <answer16657> There is an app for upload and download speed though, along with disk access and cpu usage, all shown in the menu bar at the top: http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/.  <comment18197> And the value displayed on the badge is either the total download rate or total upload rate for all the torrents currently being managed by the app. <comment18203> Also, if your question was partially because you are looking for an application to display network statistics, have a look at [iStat Menus](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) <comment18205> Thanks - it is just not as pretty as Transmission. :)
