iMessage app wont open on macbook pro and will freeze mac trying to open <body> I have tried opening it from the dock, launchpad and applications folder but it still will not open and then the mac freezes. Anyone have any suggestions?  <comment246183> Sometimes going to the app itself and using Open in the contextual menu works. You might also trash its Saved State folder in your Library and restarting the app.
