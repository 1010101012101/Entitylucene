Network and general process priority of apps running in background? <body> Clarification: When I mean background, I did not mean head-less process or background tasks, I meant normal apps (like browser or terminal) with the UI not in the immediate foreground.  I feel like there is some kind of optimization (possibly for power management) that reduces process priority. I am running a fairly long running (data loader to AWS) and I would like to switch to other tasks, but the switching causes the process to be very slow indeed. Is there a way to circumvent this optimization?
