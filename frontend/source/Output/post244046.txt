iPhone 5s Phantom Photos Will Not Delete <body> I  have about 14GB of space taken-up by photos that aren't there.  I've seen the date reset to delete recently deleted photos, however that does not work for me.  I do not want to reset my iPhone to fix this problem if I don't have to.    <answer247362> I had the same problem.  iOS devices have a delayed delete function.  To solve the "phantom photo/video" issue, do the following:  ol liDelete what you want deleted/li liOpen Photos app on iOS device./li liOpen 'Recently Deleted' folder. /li liDelete items from phone permanently./li li(Re)plug phone into laptop and Sync./li /ol  The photos/videos size drop to appropriately after I did this.  Cheers.
