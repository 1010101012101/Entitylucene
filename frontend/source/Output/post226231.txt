unable to install homebrew <body> unable to install homebrew I am using this command.  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  getting this error. i have already installed updated command line tool  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/70WHi.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKI5U.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer226234> From your output, it looks like the developer tools version of codegit/code is missing. You could uninstall Xcode (delete it) and try again a manual install of just the tools stronghomebrew/strong needs.  I prefer to install the command line tools as follows:  ul liHave an admin user/password handy - you don't need to be logged in as an admin - just know the password/li licode/usr/bin/xcode-select --install/code/li /ul  That should either error if you have Xcode already installed or command line tools. If you don't have the necessary tools - it will download and ask for installation.  Please note - the Mac App store is having issues right now - you might be doing everything right and need to wait for the server issues to get sorted:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus//li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EVGh6.png" alt="enter image description here"  To get past the check you are running into, the command below needs to return a good match that git is strongMach-O 64-bit executable x86_64/strong:  precodefile $(/usr/bin/xcode-select -print-path)/usr/bin/git /code/pre  <comment274702> The error message includes a suggestion to update via **Apple (menu)  App Storeâ€¦**. What do you see in **App Store.app** under the **Updates** tab? <comment274703> i have already updated Command line tool. check updated second image. <comment274709> What does `/usr/bin/xcode-select -print-path` show? I've deleted my answer since you don't need any software updates and you might only need to run `sudo /usr/bin/xcode-select -r` if you don't get the correct directory listing from the print path command. From what I can tell,your script can't find a git binary and is asking for the developer tools to be installed yet you already have them installed. <comment274734> file $(/usr/bin/xcode-select -print-path)/usr/bin/git /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/git: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64 <comment274735> Have you [opened an issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues) with homebrew themselves? Maybe someone there has seen this before. <comment274736> i have not installed xcode. is that a problem? <comment274741> @user3595194 No - you don't need Xcode. You could try installing it if your  want. It might get enough `git` for the homebrew to complete installing or throw a more intelligible error to you for action... <comment274749> i got it. just uninstall command line tool than let it install with brew. i think there is bug with brew installation command.
