Apple MacBook Pro will not do updates <body> I have this MacBook Pro running OS X Version 10.9.5 and it works perfect in every way except for one thing; it will not get updates.  When I go to "About This Mac" and click on "software update" it will close out the window and --that is all.  I am back on the desktop.  there is no error messeges, or anything.  Any ideas what I can do to fix this?  <answer252460> Three things to try - report back &amp; we can tweak this answer.  ol liTry Launching App Store directly from the Applications folder, rather than via About this Mac./li liClean out the App Store prefs &amp; caches...br Open Terminal &amp; copy/paste each of these 3 lines, hitting Enter after eachbr coderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.appstore.plist/codebr coderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.storeagent.plist/codebr coderm ~/Library/Cookies/com.apple.appstore.plist/codebr and again for the cachesbr coderm -r ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore/codebr coderm -r ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.storeagent/code  /li liMake a new admin account...br System Prefs  Users &amp; Groupsbr Unlock the prefs, if locked, &amp; click the plus button at the bottom.br Set up a new Admin [not Standard] account, then try logging yourself out &amp; into that account instead.br Test method 1./li /ol  <comment314131> It could be that your computer is too old and there are no more updates for your computer. <comment314232> Ok I tried all three suggestions and here are the results:  number one: When I clicked on the app store it just went back to the desktop - I noticed that the app store icon on the bottom bounced up once and that was all <comment314235> Suggestion 2: I attempted to open terminal but it does the same thing - just goes back to the desktop - I get the same results after creating another admin account. <comment314244> Try re-applying the [combo updater for 10.9.5](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1760?) <comment314512> Ok, I downloaded and attempted to re-apply the combo updater but I get the error message: OS X Update combined can't by installed on this disk. This volume does not meet the requirements for this update." <comment314568> I'd be tempted to raise that last comment as a new question; with a link back to this one. I'd say the next step would be to find out **why** you're getting that message, but I'm not sure myself.
