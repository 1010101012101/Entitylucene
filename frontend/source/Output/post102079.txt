Why should I use something other than Parallels <body> I am looking to use Master Genealogist on my Mac Pro with Parallels. Does anyone have experience using this program for Windows on a Mac? Any suggestions for a better setup than Parallels?  <answer102080> You might find an easier solution in Crossover because it doesn't require a complete instance of the Windows Operating System.  I don't know that Master Geneologist is tested, but it would be worth trying. The Codeweavers community is very helpful and supportive of new software packages.  <answer102119> Since you have a Mac Pro I guess you have a big hard drive. Why not setting up strongBoot Camp/strong? You sure can't go wrong with it, everything should work fine when you boot in Windows.  Other than that, I used to have Parallels, but I switched to strongVMware Fusion/strong. I think they're pretty much comparable, I just like more the fact that Fusion is less obtrusive than Parallels.  <comment120242> It would be helpful to better understand why Parallels isn't meeting your needs in order to suggest something that is *better*.
