OS X VPN Clients can't access server <body> We are currently running a Mac Mini with OS X 10.9.1 server and the VPN service is working fine. However our iMac's are having issues seeing the server on the VPN.  The Server IP is 10.0.0.1 and the IP of the connected iMac is 10.0.0.101 When the service order is configured as in the image below, a ping/access to the service over VPN is not possible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qw2kH.png" alt="iMac VPN Issues"  However, if we change the service order with the VPN interface on top ping is working but the internet is not.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dfCaW.png" alt="iMac VPN Works "  The problem is we don't want the iMac's to use the VPN for internet access (we haven't and aren't going to configure the Mac Mini for this), we just want the VPN for Apple RDP. We already have the "Send all traffic over VPN connection" unchecked. Does anyone have an explantion?
