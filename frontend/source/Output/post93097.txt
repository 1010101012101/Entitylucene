Is there a way to enable "Services" menu for an application? <body> Almost every OSx Application has a service men√∫ like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pTz1o.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I've found that my HipChat for MAC doesn't have. I don't know if there is a setting that will enable this menu or it is something related to the way the application was created.  <answer95088> It has to do with the way the application is created. More about Services in Apple Developer Documentation.  I suggest you direct HipChat Devs to this page.  <comment109235> Are you talking about the Services menu, or the group of options - hide, hide other, and show? <comment109277> He speaks of Services. <comment109330> Services, sorry the selected "Show All" could be confused in the screnshot but I am very specific about the Service Menu in the description, thanks <comment109482> Have you tried adding a Keyboard Shortcut for the application in System Preferences/Keyboard/Keyboard  Shortcuts/Application Shortcuts ? Odd that HipChat didn't install any Services, I find every app I install is allowed to do so by default, and one must go find and uncheck them. Bad design, Apple. bad.
