Audio device on iOS 4? <body> I was looking for /dev/dsp or /dev/audio through terminal but I couldn't find either of the two. Is there any audio device on iOS 4 (specifically iPhone 4) for input or output?  <answer26976> The only exposed API to use the audio hardware under iOS is the RemoteIO Audio Unit API.  The driver for the audio input/output hardware does not seem to be exposed via a *nix device on Mac OS X, or in its iDevice derivatives.  <comment30863> This technical question is probably more appropriate for stackoverflow.com than on apple.stackexchange. <comment30879> Welcome to Ask Different!
