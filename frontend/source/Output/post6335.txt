Control draft saving in Apple Mail? <body> Is it at all possible to change the time for saving drafts in Apple Mail. I use MobileMe and whenever I send a mail, the draft is not automatically deleted. I don't want to switch off saving of drafts, but would like to increase the time between saves, since I don't need to save drafts for short emails.  <answer6341> If you go into Preferences, Accounts, select your account, then select the "Mailbox Behaviors" tab, there's an option to disable saving drafts on the server. I know you said you didn't want to disable saving of drafts, but this option will still save the draft on your computer, yet it won't mess up Mobile Me.  <comment6642> Lacking any better solutions this would be valid. I use different devices and even my browser, so when I do have important emails having them on the server in draft is useful. Definitely an option however, and a valid one, but not ideal for me yet.
