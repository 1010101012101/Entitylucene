Webcam Colored Lines - Hardware Issue? <body> Has anyone seen this before? It's happening with any camera app (Skype, Photo Booth, Hangouts) so it doesn't appear to be software related. I'm assuming it's a hardware issue but I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this before. Thanks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BPqe3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer124317> Note that I am GUESSING here but that looks awfully like a damaged sensor. You occasionally see similar displays on LCD panels when they go bad so this might indeed be the hardware error you think it is.  <comment145372> are you using the internal isight webcam or an external camera, and when you take a picture in photo booth for example does the resulting image show the same lines? <comment145376> Looks like a broken camera to me indeed. <comment145382> This is the internal webcam - and yes it is the same when taking a picture in photo booth. <comment302485> can any one help.... coloured lines are seen on the webcamera ,but the laptop display is proper.[![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/486kD.jpg)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/486kD.jpg)
