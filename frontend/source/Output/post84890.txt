Comparing iPad mini data plans; Why choose AT&T, it has fewer countries and is more expensive? <body> I'm trying to choose between the various data plans for an iPad Mini.  Based on this chart it appears that the ATT model (A1454) only works in North/South America, while model A1455 is supported worldwide.  For this reason (limitation) I assumed the ATT plan would be least expensive per MB/Month, however it is the most expensive per month:  precode  ATT       250MB per month $14.99   SPRINT    300MB per month $14.99  (better value)   Verizon     1GB per month $20.00  (best value) /code/pre  What is the value in the ATT network or related technology that I'm missing?  Finally, I've been told that GSM operates worldwide, are both these models GSM or CDMA?  <answer85069> The value of any particular carrier is based on the performance of the carrier in the area you will use the device.  ie. My area has great AT&amp;T coverage, Good Verizon coverage and horrible Sprint coverage.  You are also only comparing the cheapest tier. Prices change and one carrier may be cheaper than another at a different level of service.  <comment97774> The chart that you are looking for is for LTE (**4G**) only. Both models support GSM, and the A1455 also supports CDMA, check here: https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/. Also, both models would work worldwide on **3G** as they support UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz). <comment103978> What @drummin said, and if you already use AT&T then you'd probably want to stick with it.
