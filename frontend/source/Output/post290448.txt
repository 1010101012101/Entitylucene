Show/Hide only specific hard drives on desktop and/or sidebar <body> Is it possible to show only specific hard drives on the desktop?  I have a MacPro tower (3,1) with 3 drives. The boot drive is running El Cap, but there is a legacy boot drive that I would like to keep live, but mostly I don't want users to access it.  Can I put the El Cap boot drive on the desktop somehow, but leave off the legacy drive?  Does not seem possible in the GUI, or by directly writing to the com.apple.finder plist.  Anyone have any tricks?  <comment366617> You can exclude it in the fstab file. Search this site for that keyword. On phone now so limited functionality.
