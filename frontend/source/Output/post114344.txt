Force an App to Open Full Screen in a Specific Desktop Space <body> I'm running Mavericks OS X 10.9  As the title suggests I would like to force an app to open in full screen in a specific desktop space.  I can get an app to always open full screen, then position the app in the desired desktop space.  However, when I close the app and reopen, it will always open as the right most desktop space.  Any one have any ideas as to how I may address this?  <answer132267> Go to System Preferences, Mission Control, and untick "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use"  This has worked for me for the last 10 minutes  <comment141248> How do you get the app to always open full screen? <comment141340> Open the app and set it to full screen. After you quit/close the app, it will reopen full screen. Which is by design and seems to work pretty consistently. <comment155511> have you tried positioning the app fullscreen furthest to the left? If I then close the app and reopen it it wont reappear in that same position.
