Cannot connect to IMAP server anymore in Sierra <body> I am trying to connect to an email server via IMAP using Mail.app. The server only supports SSL connections (port 993). It used to work in some previous version of OS X, and it works with various Windows and Android apps, however I usually get a warning about an invalid certificate (it is self-signed / signed by a local CA).  With Mail.app from Sierra (10.12.4), I get an error message     strongThe identity of "servername" could not be verified./strong      The certificate for this server is invalid.      [ OK ]   Note there is no "Show Certificate" or "Connect" option.  I read somewhere that Apple does not support certain outdated encryption methods, such as SSLv3, anymore, and I'm guessing this could be the cause of this problem.  Is there any way I can make Mail.app connect anyway? Either by forcing it to accept the certificate or hacking something? Or is there a way to install a simple IMAP proxy (which would sit between the server and Mail.app, and handle the encryption that Mail.app won't)?  (Note I'm aware of the security implications of accepting an untrusted certificate and potentially using an old cipher suite. However I have no influence on how the server is set up, and I would just like to make it work.)
