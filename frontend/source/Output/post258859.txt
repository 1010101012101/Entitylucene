iPhone 6S+ (iOS 10). Apple Music playlist does not save sort changes! <body> strongThen:/strong When I wished to rearrange songs within a playlist, I would hit "edit", move the songs using the grey bars accordingly, hit "done" and that would be it. Easy!  strongNow:/strong I do the exact same thing, except upon hitting "done", all the songs revert to their original positions.  What's up? Creating a new playlist every time is a ridiculous workaround.
