Album added to iTunes library but not listed in Albums and Songs section <body> I added a new album to my iTunes (version 11). It has been copied to my Media folder and it plays fine. But it's not listed in my Albums, Artists and Songs sections. I would like to see the artwork in my Albums or list of songs.  I'm able to find the album by searching. What to do? Any ideas?  I believe that adding it again might help, but how do I remove it from my library when it is not present anywhere except search results?  <answer93898> ol liTry pressing kbdcommand/kbd+ kbdL/kbd while the song is playing, this will take you to the song/album in your library. /li liThen right click and choose "strongGet Info/strong" to verify the codemetadata/code for the song &amp; album./li /ol  It may not be displaying as expected if the codemetadata/code for the song doesn't match the filenames.  <answer127826> You can try to search in the playlist "Recently Added" for the items you have added. If they appear in there, right click the items and click on the "Options" tab and set "Media Type" to "Music".  <answer140951> ol liFind the song in iTunes:  ul liIn the search tool in iTunes 11, type the song name to find the song. Once it is displayed, you should be able to click strongonce/strong on the result to go to the song./li liAlternatively, you can press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdL/kbd while the song is playing as described by @DavidLumpkin./li /ul/li liOne the song has been found, right-click on it and choose codeGet Info/code./li liIn the codeInfo/code tab make sure that the codeName/code, codeArtist/code, and codeAlbum/code fields contain the correct information.  ul liIf there is any text - even a space - in the codeAlbum Artist/code field (highlighted in red), strongthe song will be sorted under the codeAlbum Artist/code, instead of the codeArtist/code/strong.

Check your Music and all your albums would be listed.  <answer227284> I found them under compilations.   <answer240078> Some albums need a little more info: add names in the sort areas, and check the "Show Composer in all Views" check box. Worked for me.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PweK1.jpg" alt="Scrrenshot"  <answer248448> Under get info - make sure that the check box 'compilation' is unchecked. This will force the album to appear as an album and not a compilation..  <comment162310> if you can find the tracks/album by searching for it they must be in your Mediathek maybe it is placed where you don't expect it to be. I'm thinking about Sort Album Artist / Sort Album Name. They some times are different From Album Artist / Album Name. so to verify search for them then rightclick-edit and have a look what the Sorted Album Name is.
