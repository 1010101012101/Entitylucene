Always Asked to Configure Firewall for iTunes <body> Whenever I open iTunes, I get the standard OS X dialog, brcodeDo you want the application "iTunes.app" to accept incoming network connections?/codebr Every time I click allow, but I am asked the same thing without fail the next time I open iTunes.  In the Advanced section of the Firewall tab of the Security System Preferences pane, I see that iTunes is in fact set to allow. Changing the firewall settings makes no difference.  Any ideas for how to get this setting to stick?  <answer6454> I looked at Am1rr3za's article, and eventually it just said to reinstall iTunes, which I did. That worked. Am1rr3za, post as an answer if you want the points. Otherwise, I'll accept this one.  <comment6671> do you look at this: http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=9936677 ? <comment6675> @Am1rr3zA Thanks for the link. I tried what they suggested, and eventually fixed it with a reinstall of iTunes. Post as an answer and I'll accept you. <comment75604> Starcraft II (a 10GB game) is doing this to meâ€¦ I have to reinstall? :O /3
