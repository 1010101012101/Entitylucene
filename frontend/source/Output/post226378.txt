Hardening OSX 10.11 <body> I'm following the instruction, on hardentheworld.org to harden my OS X 10.11.  When I send the following command:  precodesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ProgramArguments -array-add "-NoMulticastAdvertisements" /code/pre  I obtain:  precodeCould not write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder; exiting /code/pre  My question is why this error happens and how to solve it?  <answer226386> System Integrity Protection (SIP.) It locks up a variety of files to prevent malicious software from modifying it including /System. You can temporarily disable SIP, modify your files, then turn it back on if you want to have the maximum protection.
