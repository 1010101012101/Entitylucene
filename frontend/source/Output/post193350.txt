Solution for syncing directory hierarchy of images from Mac to iOS? <body> I'm a photographer and need to keep an updated set of portfolio images synced from my Mac to my iOS devices and available for strongoffline/strong viewing. I have around 300 images totalling ~150MB)  Right now the directory that I want to sync looks like this on my Mac:  precodePortfolio-2015/  Project 01/    Car.jpg    Boat.jpg    Bus  Project 02/    Zebra.jpg    Lion.jpg  ..x 150 /code/pre  I've found several solutions that accommodate the syncing part of this problem but for some reason none of them them allow you to mark a folder (and its hierarchy) to work off-line on the iOS device.  So far I've tried Google Drive, Dropbox and OwnCloud. All of these have iOS clients that allow you to 'favorite' individual files for off-line access but none of them allow you 'favorite' a folder.  Does anyone know of a solution that will work for me?  <answer193616> You could use Box.   To my knowledge, they used to offer this feature.   <comment230414> Have you tried [Box](https://www.box.com/)? I think they offer this feature. (I'm not sure, as I'm currently using a combination of Dropbox and iCloud Drive) <comment230533> I've just finished testing Box and it does exactly what I need.
