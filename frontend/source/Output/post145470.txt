Ping command works in Network utility but not in terminal <body> I am on os x 10.9.4  If I ping google from the network utility I get 0% packet loss.   But if I try to ping google from the terminal with codeping www.google.com/code I get 100% packet loss. System Preferences - Firewall shows it is turned off.   What else might be happening?  <answer146790> What is the error message you get when you are pinging from the terminal?  try an nslookup www.google.com and make sure that your dns is resolving correctly  <comment171472> that is ping google.com (without www)
