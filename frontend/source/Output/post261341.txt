Bootcamp problems <body> I have a new Mid 2012 13" MacBook Pro. The last version with USB-3 ports and an optical drive that is not retina. I installed a Samsung 850 pro SSD and have Sierra up and running. I am trying to install Windows 10 with Bootcamp, I have a dvd installation disk. I don't have a USB drive. I have read that you don't need a USB drive anymore since Yosemite. When I try to create the partition I am getting the error that the drive cannot be partitioned. I really don't know what to do as Sierra is the only thing on the drive.   I have made an ISO file of the dvd installer, and it is mounted.  I have run the disk utility and no errors are found.  I shouldn't need a USB DVD drive, correct? All OS past El Capitan aren't supposed to need a USB DVD drive correct? Does having an older model go against this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONXkY.png" alt="enter image description here"
