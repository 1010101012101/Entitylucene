Yosemite Beta - is there a way to see overall status of iCloud Drive? <body> I have moved a large folder with many subfolders to my iCloud drive. If I dig around I can catch a status bar next to a file name (same as during a download), but it seems to be taking a lot longer to upload than I would think. Besides catching an upload in progress I don't see a way to tell what has been uploaded or is waiting. Is there anything I am missing?   Dropbox had a nifty menu bar icon that would display progress and pending files.    <comment177338> You're just a little bit earlyâ€”you can't ask questions about OS X Yosemite until it's released (probably some time this week).
