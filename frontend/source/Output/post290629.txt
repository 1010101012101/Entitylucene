Cannot connect to PS printer / .local address on my local network <body> My MacBookPro running MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 cannot connect to my printer, while other Macs on the same network, running the same software, can.   In System preferences the printer can be identified and added through Bonjour, but when it tries to configure it automatically, it won't connect. The printer has an admin page that the other macs can access through the browser via http://oki-c841.local. My MacBook cannot.   My MacBook emcan/em access other devices on the network, like another printer via http://canon0ebc94.local/ and our Synology, via IP and .local  The issue started after I switched the network connection of the printer. It has only ethernet, so I use a nano router in client mode to give it access to our wifi. This works fine for everyone, except not for my MacBook pro. Before I was using a set of powerline adapters but they gave out. At that time I had no issues printing from this MacBook Pro.   I have been scouring the internet looking for info on Bonjour and other networking specifics that might be at play. I do have Apache server activated and have configured a virtual host, but this issue occurred before I had done so.   Anyone know where this might be coming from or how I could troubleshoot?  Router: Airport Extreme Tower.  Printer: OKI C841 Network-enabled PS printer. Drivers properly installed.  Nano router: TP-Link TL-WR802N.   In Network Utility › Routing table, this is how the devices show up (on another mac):    precode192.168.1.5        a4:2b:b0:e1:3c:7a  UHLWI           0      236     en0   1185 192.168.1.6        a4:2b:b0:e1:3c:7a  UHLWI           0      466     en0    997 /code/pre  Where 1.5 is the printer and 1.6 is the TP-Link nano router, both showing up with the Mac address of the nano router. Neither is accessible on my MBPro. So frustrating that this works on one machine but not on another.
