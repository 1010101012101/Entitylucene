Syncing photos from iPhoto on a Mac to Photos under iOS8 <body> iTunes used to have an option for syncing an iPhoto library with one's iPhone. This seems to be gone now, leaving only the option of syncing a folder of pictures from one's Mac. Is there some way to sync an iPhoto library, or should I export all these photos to a directory and sync that?  <answer146119> Sync Photos from ... iPhoto [or Aperture, a named folder, or Pictures]  ul liAll photos, albums, Events &amp; Faces  /li /ul  That's everything.
