USB key behaves as a CD <body> My USB key behaves as a CD, because I'm not able to copy a code.dmg/code  file from my MacBook Pro 2016 with `sudo dd if=/Users/jeremiegauthier/Downloads/ubuntu-gnome-16.10-desktop-amd64.dmg of=/dev/rdisk2 or with the following method :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WCf4a.png" alt="enter image description here"  Could anyone be able to tell what I need to do to allow the access?  <answer263580> You need to precede the codedd/code command with codesudo/code to give you permission.  I provide this answer with some reluctance because using codedd/code is strongextremely risky/strong. You can easily overwrite your system if you use the incorrect target. If you do not already know how to use codesudo/code on the command line, you should look for other image copying tools, with inbuilt safeguards.
