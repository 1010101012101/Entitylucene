How to exclude a sub folder from iCloud drive in macOS Sierra? <body> I have my Documents folder synced with iCloud drive, I want to exclude some sub folders from the iCloud drive is there a way to achieve this?  <answer256369> It looks like directories that are named "tmp" or end with ".tmp" are not synced. A cloud icon with a line through it appears next to the directory along with anything inside of it.  <answer261437> Also adding .nosync to a name will avoid syncing.  <answer295929> Here are all the file/folder names excluded so maybe one of these could be used for a workaround:  ul liis code.DS_Store/code/li libegins with code(A Document Being Saved/code/li licontains code.nosync/code (in any case)/li liis code.ubd/code/li licontains code.weakpkg/code/li liis codetmp/code (in any case)/li liis code.tmp/code (in any case)/li liis codedesktop.ini/code (in any case)/li libegins with ~$/li liis codeMicrosoft User Data/code (in any case)/li liis code$RECYCLE.BIN/code (in any case)/li liis codeiPhoto Library/code (in any case)/li liis codeDropbox/code (in any case) /li liis codeOneDrive/code (in any case)/li liis codeIDrive-Sync/code (in any case)/li liis code.dropbox/code (in any case)/li liis code.dropbox.attr/code (in any case)/li liis codeicon\r/code (in any case)/li /ul  extension is (in any case):  ul licodetmp/code/li licodephotoslibrary/code/li licodephotolibrary/code/li licodeaplibrary/code/li licodemigratedaplibrary/code/li licodemigratedphotolibrary/code/li licodemigratedaperturelibrary/code/li /ul  extension is more than 2 chars and filename is code~/code  Hopefully in a future version of the OS they let us put .nosync inside the folder to exclude it, or have an .IgnoreList like Resilio has.  <comment373501> what if you put a hidden .nosync file in the folder will that also stop the folder from syncing? <comment373753> It works!  Brilliant!  It does indeed stop the folder. Even after the fact.  I just tried it.  +1 from me
