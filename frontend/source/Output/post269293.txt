What is the "Spray Like" icon in the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar? <body> There is an icon that looks like a spray can on the right side of the Touch Bar (4th-5th button from the right?)  Does anyone know what it is for?  (Sorry I couldn't find an image of it on the web)  <answer269301> It seems to be linked to the simulator in Xcode.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oECu1.png" alt="the touchbar with spraycan"  When pressed this expands into some debugging shortcuts as shown in this screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pa0zk.png" alt="Expanded"  You can also see this icon on 9to5 macs article about the touchbar. 9to5mac link  <comment338292> You can take a screenshot of the Touch Bar yourself by hitting ⌘+⇧+6 in 10.12.2 and add the picture to your question. <comment338294> Ah, didn't know that, I'll post it in about an hour. (kinda busy atm) <comment338301> Ah you are absolutely right! It was driving me crazy. Thanks! <comment338302> but it is sooo intuitive ;)
