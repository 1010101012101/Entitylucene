How to download via home-brew when connected though Internet dongle? <body> I wanted to download python on my Mac OS Mavericks. I found a blog which instructed to download it via home-brew using simple command  precodebrew install python /code/pre  But I am getting failed to download errors. I am connected to the internet via my 3G dongle but when I type into the terminal  precodecurl http://www.google.com /code/pre  Nothing happens!! Could it be the case that I am unable to access internet via the terminal when connected through a dongle? If so please suggest how do I make this to work!!  <comment192194> Does connecting with Safari work? Is there a proxy installed (see System Preferences - Network)? <comment195744> OS X comes with Python, so you might not need to install it.
