What does the undocumented switch, `-v`, do for `tmutil restore` command? <body> I couldn't find anywhere what the code-v/code switch does with the codetmutil restore/code command. An answer would be greatly appreciated.  <answer272787> The codetmutil/code emcommands/em coderestore/code emverb/em syntax is:  precoderestore [-v] src ... dst /code/pre  The use of the code-v/codeemoption/em produces emverbose output/em during the emrestore/em, i.e. additional information about the emrestore/em that's not outputted without it.  As a side note, codetmutil -v/code will output the emversion/em of codetmutil/code.  <comment342843> Thanks, but is there a source to authenticate your answer? <comment342844> @Eliad, Yes, run the command with and without the `-v` switch and see the difference for yourself. :) <comment342845> Will do, but afk atm. Thanks <comment342950> You're right, it was more obvious with an error-less usage. Thanks
