macOS Sierra takes long time to renegotiate networking as compared to Mac OS Yosemite <body> So, we have this weird problem in two parts. I'm asking to see if there is a way to mitigate the Mac laptop part.  The problem on the laptop is emcaused/em by a problem on our gateway. This is a hardware device running pfSense. What happens is that the gateway interface on the device will go down, or appear to go down, and the Mac laptops in the office will no longer be able to ping the gateway or get out onto the internet. The gateway itself recovers in only about 3 seconds. But the problem is that macOS Sierra laptops take around 90 seconds to recover from this event. Whereas the Windows and Mac OS Yosemite laptops in the office recover within 5 or 6 seconds.  Please don't focus on the problems with the gateway device. This question is not about that. I'm researching that separately.  My question is: Is there a way I can make macOS Sierra recover more quickly?  Additional information and questions  ul liThis only seems to happen when on WiFi. The network topology is as follows:/li /ul   precode+-------+ |laptop +--+ +-------+  |  +---------+  +---------+  +--------+ +-------+  +--+  WiFi   |  |Gateway/ |  |Cable   | |laptop +-----|  Router +--+Firewall +--+Modem   | +-------+  +--+         |  |         |  |        | +-------+  |  +---------+  +---------+  +--------+ |laptop +--+ +-------+ /code/pre   Nothing unusual here. When the event happens, I am always still able to reach the Wifi router; I am strongnot/strong able to reach the Gateway, and strongnot/strong able to reach the Internet.  ul liIs there some additional logging I can enable somewhere on my laptop to improve my analysis?/li liIs there some setting I can change so the recovery behavior is as fast as it is on Yosemite?/li /ul  Any advice at all is helpful. I'm just looking for a band-aid while the real problem (the broken Gateway) is addressed separately.
