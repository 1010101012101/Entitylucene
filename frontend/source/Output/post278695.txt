cannot install Yosemite on mid-2010 MBP <body> so I'm trying to install either Mavericks, Yosemite, and El Capitan on this MBP.  Results:  ul liOn Mavericks, I keep on getting a message that says "my copy of the installer is corrupt or may have been tampered with during downloading"./li liSame results as above on Yosemite/li liNo issues installing El Capitan. The MBP booted fine and I was browsing the net without any issues./li /ul  On all 3 cases, I was using the same USB stick; a Sandisk Extreme 16GB.  On all 3 cases, I'm trying to install OS X via a USB stick installer that was created using the "createmedia" command.  Using this page https://github.com/notpeter/apple-installer-checksums  ul liI found out my Mavericks installer is most likely corrupt/li liMy Yosemite installer checks out fine (same SHA1 sum)/li liMy El Capitan installer checks out fine (same SHA1 sum)/li /ul  Any ideas why I'm unable to install Yosemite when my installer is not corruptâ€‹?  Thanks  <comment350757> From where are you obtaining and how are you creating these USB installers? <comment350782> Mac app store. As for how I create them, I already mentioned that in my post. Thanks <comment350783> Try a different USB stick.  I bought SanDisks that I could not for the life of me get an installer to work.  I pulled out a generic 8GB flash I got at a trade show and it worked perfectly.  After talking with SanDisk, it appears the ones I got were counterfeit (SanDisk is the most counterfeited flash disk on the market). <comment350857> How long ago did you get the Yosemite installer from the Mac App Store? Another possibility is that you may need to change your MBP's clock to an earlier date for it to _accept_ the installer. I've had to do this a few times on various machines. A date in late August 2015 should suffice if you wanted to try it.
