Google Hangouts on iPhone - how to have two accounts <body> Can I receive notifications from 2 Google Talk/ Hangouts accounts, by installing only one app? Does the official Google Hangouts app support this?  <answer119282> Yes, in Hangout's settings you can add new accounts.   <answer139932> It may help to add that this is done by clicking on your profile picture and touching the +Manage Accounts item that then appears below your profile picture.
