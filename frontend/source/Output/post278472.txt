How to stop Microsoft Skype For Business for starting after reboot <body> How do I stop Microsoft Skype For Business from automatically starting every time I rebook macOS?  <answer278473> If it's not in the Skype settings, you can always keep apps from automatically starting in System Preferences:  Apple menu - System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - Login Items.  Simply find Skype in the list and press the [-] button on the bottom.  <answer278474> Did you check the Login Items?  codeSystem Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Login Items/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9dAI.png" alt="enter image description here"  To remove an item, choose it and hit the kbd-/kbd-button at the bottom. Just checking or unchecking the emhide/em radio button won't disable the login item!  <comment350409> Thank you. I did 'uncheck' this option but it seems it only works if you completely remove it. <comment350414> Why did you re-post your own question and accept the same solution? <comment350415> Sorry I forgot I posted the previous question.
