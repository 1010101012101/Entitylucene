External 4K monitor shows wrong resolution <body> I bought a Philips 288P6 4k-monitor and plugged it to my Retina MacBook Pro 15".  For a few days it worked just great. When selecting codeScaled/code instead of codeBest for Display/code, it gave me the retina style selection of codeMore Space/code etc.  Now, today when I again hooked up the screen to my MacBook, the display showed an awful 1080p resolution. When I go the codeSystem Properties &gt; Displays/code and select codeScaled/code, only 1080p and bunch of lower resolutions are shown.  What's up with this and how can I fix it?  <comment198717> i don't know the answer, but I just love how you threw 'awful' in there for 1080p :) welcome to 2015 everyone
