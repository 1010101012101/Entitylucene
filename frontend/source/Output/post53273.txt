Encountering: "Error 2000" when trying to jailbreak iOS 5.1.1. What does this mean? <body> Using RedSn0w, I tried to jailbreak iOS 5.1.1 on a 3GS and at the first step of "preparing" an error comes at 91% completion saying: "Error 2000". What does this mean and how can I fix this?   <answer53274> I had the same problem. turn off your iphone and put it in DFU mode than start redsnow, jailbrake and let it install. it worked for me.   <answer61625> DFU mode is the secret!
