I deleted /usr/local/bin on my Mac. Is there any way I can see what was installed there? <body> I accidentally ran coderm -rf /usr/local/bin/code.  Yes, I know, I'm an idiot.  Is there anything short of attempting to run every single application on my Mac to see what applications need to be reinstalled?  <answer150772> Most GUI Applications don't touch code/usr/local/bin/code, so the Applications in your code/Applications/code folder should still be in working condition. Some do install command line tools, but usually there is a menu item in the help or program menu to reinstall that command line item. Bottom line: If you don't use the command line much, you should be fine. If you use it frequently, you will see a "File not found" error when trying to run the command.  The only way to see what was in there, is indeed a backup.  <answer222257> If you used Homebrew, this directory tells you what you have lost:     /usr/local/Cellar/   precodeautoconf/     cloog/        hello/        libmagic/     libxml2/      p7zip/        ruby-build/   w3m/ autossh/      crystal-lang/ imagemagick/  libmpc/       libyaml/      pkg-config/   sdl/          x264/ awscli/       ffmpeg/       isl/          libpcl/       llvm/         pngcrush/     shiboken/     xvid/ bdw-gc/       freetype/     jpeg/         libpng/       mpfr/         pyside/       ssdeep/       xz/ binwalk/      gcc/          lame/         libtool/      openssl/      qt/           tree/          brew-cask/    gmp/          libevent/     libvo-aacenc/ optipng/      rbenv/        unrar/     /code/pre  To correctly execute Homebrew reinstall scripts you might also need to restart bash session if you used rbenv.  <comment177421> I'm guessing that you don't have a recent backup ? <comment177422> I see, this is not a huge deal.  As I run command line programs, if I run into an error I will just install the appropriate program.  Thanks for your help.
