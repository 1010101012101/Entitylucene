MacBook Air 2011 - External Display <body> I currently have a MacBook Air 13" 2011.   I want to connect two external Displays. Does it work? I think it can speak to two Displays. When the internal Display is closed, it should be possible to connect another display to have two one!  I want to buy a Dock where i can close the display and have two external ones.   Does anyone know if this solution works?   <answer62641> The specs say that it only supports a single external display.  <answer115876> Check out the Air Display app.  <comment72351> There's only 1 Thunderbolt port for Air mid 2011 <comment91688> [This guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIVZI1cFiAw) did it with a MacBook Pro and an USB to DVI adapter. Maybe this also works with the Air.
