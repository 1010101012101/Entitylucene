How to move Keychain from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion? <body> I am trying to move keychain database from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion.  I can't find the place of keychain in Mountain Lion anymore.  Even if I will find that keychain file location:  ol liWill it be enough just copy keychain database file?/li liOr is the database file from Snow Leopard not compatible with Mountain Lion?/li liHow to move keychain database from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion? /li /ol  <answer61865> Apparently both Keychain's files are in the same place in Both OS versions sup1/sup sup2/sup. code~/Library/Keychains//code. Copying all the folder's content from one to another should do the trick.   <comment71444> Funny before I can't see that folder.. maybe it's because the installation was clean ? and nothing was saved in Keychain yet :)
