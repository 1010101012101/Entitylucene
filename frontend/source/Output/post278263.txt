TimeMachine backup gets stuck during "Preparing Backup"; can't mount .sparsebundle file <body> I've twice now tried to initiate a TimeMachine backup, and both times they got stuck during the "Preparing Backup..." stage. I think even on the same file, as shown in codetmutil status/code which got stuck both times when processing file code1117289/code. I've restarted the computer.  According to some support links on the web, I should try to get rid of the code.inProgress/code file on the TimeMachine backup server. From what I understand, it's located in the code.sparsebundle/code file corresponding to my backup.   However, opening the contents of the sparsebundle, I do not see it. When I instead try mounting the sparsebundle, I get the following Finder error message:     Image: my-backup.sparsebundle | Reason: Resource temporarily unavilable   I'm not sure what the issue is here. I'm running TimeMachine on a Synology NAS on the network. Running macOS 10.12.4.
