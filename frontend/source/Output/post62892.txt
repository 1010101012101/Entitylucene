How to create new message in iChat without sending, using Automator to grab selected text <body> I am trying to create a service that grabs the URL of some link, then create a blank iMessage with that URL in the body. Basically, I want to recreate that Message share feature in Safari in Mountain Lion, but with Reeder.app, specifically. "Copy Link" from the context menu doesn't always work, esp. when sending to a iphone, the URL drops, and all you get is the alias.  I've set up an Automator with Applescript, and I can definitely send a message to a buddy, if those things are specified. I'd prefer to populate that in iMessage, since I won't always be sending to the same person.  Below works, using set input as a proxy for automator's url grabbing at the moment.  precodeset input to "http://aol.com" tell application "Messages"           set theBuddy to buddy "camelot@mac.com" of service "iCloud"           send input to theBuddy end tell /code/pre  Also tried  precodetell application "Messages"     set theBuddy to buddy "*" of service "iCloud"     set input to invitation message of text chat of service "iCloud" end tell /code/pre  Both from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3923965?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer108550> You have to do it with UI scripting :   precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Messages"     set input to "http://aol.com" as text     click button 1 of group 1 of splitter group 1 of window 1     delay 1     keystroke "Buddy@provider.com" -- type the reciever     keystroke return -- validate the previous input     keystroke tab -- move to message input     keystroke input -- type the message end tell /code/pre  <comment72567> Interestingly, in a workaround, using the two buddies will almost always use with 'send input to "buddy@me.com"', i get a working service. it is available in Safari for a URL, but it is not available in Reeder.app as a service for anything. It doesn't show in the context menu, it doesn't show up in Reeder  Services. Odd. Is this a Reeder issue? I noticed that my service is in "Internet" category in Services Manager...I would still rather have a blank iMessage with a URL in the text, so that I can amend if I want.
