Unable to uncheck the "Encrypt Backup" box, in iTunes 11 <body> I am running iTunes 11, and have just plugged in my iPad 2 (running iOS 6.1.2) in.  I would like my back-ups to be unencrypted, but I can't uncheck the check box that would allow me to, as you can see in the screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kgMnz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Anyone know how to fix this?  I do know the backup password, and have tried changing it but to no avail.  <answer83030> Odd. Offhand, the first thing I would think of is restoring the device, even though that's a bit of a pain. But that might not fix the problem.   <answer100959> you can, if you want delete your backup and create a new one, to do so head over to strongiTunes/strong  strongprefrences/strong  strongdevices/strong select your backup then delete it, now plug in your phone and create a new backup, should take an average 4-7 minutes depending on your device and content on your iDevice  <answer267109> I had a similar issue and documented the procedure here:     I have found that this can be caused by installed Profiles   (Crashlytics Provisioning Profile in my case, but some other people   reported the same with an M1 (the telecommunication company) Profile   installed).      To delete it:      ul   liGo to Settings  General  Profile, tap on the appâ€™s configuration profile./li   liThen tap Delete Profile. If asked, enter your device pass-code, then tap Delete./li   /ul      Then:      ul   liGo to the Summary page for your device in iTunes/li   liDouble check "Automatically Back Up" is set to "This computer"/li   liDouble check "Encrypt iPhone backup" is emunchecked/em/li   liPress "Back Up Now"/li   /ul   <comment95720> This might be a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/81006/9058. Can you check the answer there and report back whether it solved your problem as well? <comment95721> Just wanted to write the same.. <comment335052> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
