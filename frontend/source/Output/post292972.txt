Switching screens with multiple iterm windows across monitors issue <body> So, I have two monitors, and I often have multiple spaces on each, including an iterm2 window for each monitor. An issue I have is that if I have my iterm2 window active on one monitor, and then I switch to my second iterm2 space on the other monitor with a command+right-arrow press, the monitor I switched to is not necessarily the iterm2 window that is in focus. It seems to be in focus exactly 50% of the time (alternating), and this really screws up my workflow when constantly switching between windows. Is there anyway to guarantee that the iterm2 window of the space i just switched into is always the one in focus unless I specifically focus on the other? This is only an issue when changing spaces resulting in an iterm window open on each monitor.  <comment369632> Basically, Spaces was never meant to work with any app using more than one Space. YMMV [with no fix] on anything you try to do once you have that as your setup. Some people [ie me] are much happier if 'Displays have separate Spaces' is unchecked & then they just move in pairs,
