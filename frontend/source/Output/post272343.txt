How to remain logged in to captive portals on MACOS? <body> After upgrading to macos sierra (from osX lion), I am getting a pseudo login page(captive portals) in secured network area to log into the network. Previously I used to do it through the web browser. However in that case I had to keep the browser open which takes much memory. However this captive portal looks good and I can still log in through it.  Now in my secured network, the authentication is refreshed in every 10 mins. In browser, this is automatically done. However in captive portals it does not and I have to relogin in every 10 mins i.e. it is not refreshed automatically. Is there a way to fix this? Many thanks in advance.  <comment342361> can you use something like 1password, lastpass, or icloud keychain to store the login credentials and automatically input them whenever you're prompted?
