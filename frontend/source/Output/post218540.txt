How do I set the mail.app message font to San Fransisco (System Font) <body> I'm using Mail.app in Mac OS X 10.11 (Yosemite).  I would like for messages I compose to appear in the new, lovely, San Francisco font. I cannot seem to make that happen because neither "System Font" or "San Francisco" are available in the OS X Font chooser.  Is there a way to make this font available for message composition?  <answer218543> Here's a way to solve this problem that you emdefinitely should not pursue/em because it may be a licence violation:  ul liDownload the SF fonts from developer.apple.com/fonts/li liOpen the downloaded fonts in Font Book./li liBoom./li /ul  Thanks to tetsujin for this answer to a similar, more general question  <comment264212> @Tetsujin I think the answer is the same (thanks, btw!) but the question is different enough that most people won't find that other question if they're looking for this. <comment264215> Having it linked as a dupe is actually better for Googlers in future - they have twice as many chances to find it ;)
