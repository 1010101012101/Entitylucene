I Can't login with a Google account <body> The problem started after I restored from timemachine, but in a couple of days I saw that my gmail didn't work in Mail.app (my iCloud mail works fine) then I tried log out and log in again (with my google account in system pref.) but after I have selected the services I want to use and press "OK" it will just hang at this screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3qVL.png" alt="  "  I hope some of you can help me to solve this problem.  <answer230262> Found a solution, used this command in terminal codechmod -RN ~/Library//code  <comment280817> can you provide more data on this? Do you have two step authorization enabled in Google account? It works like a charm in my case, no problems occurred. <comment280972> @Farside I don't have two factor autentification activated.
