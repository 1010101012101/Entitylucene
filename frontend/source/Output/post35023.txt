How can I have a fixed order of the menu-extras? <body> Like the OSX menu items for wifi, battery... I would like to be able to have a strongpermanent order/strong of the third-party menu bar items.  I do not want to mix OSX with third-party menubar items, I simply want them to always appear in the strongsame order/strong.  Setting an order for the menu extras to launch in the startup items does not do the trick.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/to4rv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer35050> You can hold command while drag and drop it to change the order. I don't know it will remember the order or not though.  <answer35059> In your system preferences if you remove a menu item for whichever program is on there, and then put it back, it will go on the end of the line (left). So you can remove them and then put them all back in the order you want them. Not exactly and elegant solution but it works.   <answer35344> h2Edit:/h2  As it turns out, disabling resume upon login is enough.  hr  With Applescript, this is a nice solution.  precodeset theAppList to {{name:"Growl", vis:false}, {name:"Caffeine", vis:false}, {name:"Boom", vis:false}, {name:"Shimo", vis:false}, {name:"Twitter", vis:false}} set theDelay to 0.5  repeat with currentApp in theAppList     tell application (name of currentApp) to launch     delay theDelay     tell application "Finder" to set visible of process (name of currentApp) to (vis of currentApp) end repeat /code/pre  h2Important Note/h2  You need to disable resume upon login for this script to work. ("Reopen windows when logging back in").

Also, not all menu items do appear in the login items section. <comment39943> Oh I misread, I didn't realize you meant you wanted it that way on login. I don't know a lot about applescripts but I bet there's a way to automate it using applescript? <comment40256> It could be easier to save it as a regular script and run it with a launchd agent (see [How do I run an Automator action, shell script or AppleScript on startup in OS X? - Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/373813/how-do-i-run-an-automator-action-shell-script-or-applescript-on-startup-in-os-x)) <comment317296> @gentmatt In Sierra it works for all of them
