What's the "Private" directory in OS X for? <body> I was running OmniDiskSweeper today, and I came across something called "Private" using 3.9GB. It is listed directly under the root directory along with Users, Library, System, and Applications, so I am assuming it is something included with OS X itself. I'm just curious about what this actually is, because I don't remember seeing this before. Here are some screenshots:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gaVM.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/taB3F.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wdTBP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Mid 2012 15 inch MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.3 El Capitan  <answer227869> /private has been around for a emloooooong/em time. Every Mac has it.  It is part of your Mac: the directory stores essential system files and caches, along with other databases that your system requires to operate.  hr  I'll give a quick explanation contents of the folders /private/etc, /private/tmp, and /private/var, usually found in /private:  strong/private/etc/strong  Data files for system use, configurations for various command line tools etc  strong/private/tmp/strong  System logs, mostly  strong/private/var/strong  More logs, databases for daemons, virtual memory swap file(s), sleep image etc.  hr  In essence, deleting emanything/em in this directory is probably not a good idea, save for a few files. If you do delete them however, some required essential files will get regenerated on startup.  It's probably a good idea to Google the strongexact/strong full directory path of any system folders you intend to tinker with before actually beginning to experiment with stuff inside.  I hope this helps.  <comment277733> Have you tried googling some of the file names? the more unique the more chance of finding the cause. <comment277757> @Mark I believe your proposed duplicate is more of a /private/tmp-related question, but ComputerScienceStudent's question here asks more of "what is /private for". <comment277759> @Mark, "What's the “Private” directory in OS X for?" and "Why is /tmp a symlink to /private/tmp?" **are not** duplicate questions, not even possible duplicates IMPO. <comment277761> The answer in the duplicate is an answer here - it could be expanded a bit but it is still the same answer <comment277765> Thank you! I won't delete any of them, just curious. <comment277766> Not a duplicate. See the answer below. @Mark <comment277828> I'm leaving this closed. OP - could you remove the imaged and restate what you don't get? Since you've already received and accepted an answer - keeping this closed to new answers is good for the site since it now points to the main discussion on what /private is and does.
