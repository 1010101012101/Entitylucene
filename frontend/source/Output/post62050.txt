changing language on ipad3 <body> I changed language on the iPad3 from english to italian, but I noticed that a few things remain in english. For instance, day and time in locked screen, as well as in the calendar. Is there a way to fix it?  <answer62066> Did you try to change the Region Format settings in Settings  General  International ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oU0X1.png" alt="International Settings on iPhone"  You should be able to change it to Italian.  strongemNote :/strong this is an iPhone capture but it is exactly on the same place on the iPad. It is easier to put an iPhone capture in a post./em  <comment71665> What do you mean by day and time? Names of days like Monday, Tuesdayâ€¦?
