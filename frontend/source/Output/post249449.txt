Macbook Pro mid 2012 connect to projector via thunderbolt <body> Maybe I need to duplicate this question here I am not sure. I need to connect my macbook pro to HDMI port on 3d projector to be able watch full hd or 3d video. What cable should I buy/use?  <comment309425> @Allan thanks for suggestion, yea I've read it, in any case I still have misunderstanding between thunderbolt and mini display port, and what can fit my requirements. <comment309428> Check out this [link](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/228892/119271) or this [link](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/205626/119271) for the differences on Thunderbolt and mDP <comment309437> As written this question is a duplicate.
