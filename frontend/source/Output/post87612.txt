change MAC address in USB device <body> I'm trying to change the MAC on a USB wifi device. The usual way of doing it does nothing...  precodesudo ifconfig en4 ether 11:22:33:44:55:66 /code/pre  After doing the command there are no errors, but the MAC stays the same. I've tried disconnecting the device from any network before trying to change it... and nothing changes.  Any ideas?
