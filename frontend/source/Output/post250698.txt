How to stop iOS from showing tomorrow's birthdays everyday <body> My iPhone, for some reason (I haven't set up anything like that), shows the next day's birthdays everyday at 12:00 (at noon). How do I prevent that? I don't want to remove them from calendar, I just want to remove those annoying notifications.  (Default Alert Times for Birthdays is already set to "None")  <answer250700> ul listrongiOS Calendar:/strong Go to  empreferences / mail, contacts &amp; calendar / calendar / default alert times / birthdays/em   and select strongnone/strong. That should prevent your iOS calendar from notify you whenever there is a birthday in your calendar./li listrongFacebook/strong: Maybe these notifications are from your Facebook app. Try turning these notifications off./li /ul  Also have a look at this (similar) question.  <comment311410> There is an option called "default alert times", and it has the option Birthdays, so it's probably that. **But**, it's already set to none. <comment311435> Try turning off the Birthdays calendar in the Calendar app? <comment311437> @JohnRamos I *DO* want birthdays in my calendar. I just don't want notifications for them. <comment312384> @CanPoyrazoÄŸlu So it did not work? Have you installed another calender app like Fantastical or Sunrise? <comment312527> Nope, it didn't work (it was already set to none anyway). No, I don't use any calendar app or import any calendars (other than Facebook). <comment314776> Have you tried turning notifications for Facebook of temporarily? I Added that to my initial answer above. <comment314813> but I want the calendar reminders for Facebook events <comment315094> But you can deactivate notifications for birthdays in your Facebook app without deactivating other notifications. You can do so in the [Facebook app](https://www.facebook.com/help/103859036372845). <comment315124> Well, just looked at it, it's already unchecked.
