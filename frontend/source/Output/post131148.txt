Will my iPhone receive messages after i re-activate it? <body> My iPhone 4s was deactivated last night by my father because I am grounded. I'm not going to have it for ten days and right now it is powered off and lying on the dining room table and, like I said, deactivated. When I turn it back on and he reactivates it, will I receive the texts sent to me during that time period of deactivation? I have Verizon, if that makes a difference.  <answer131156> OK, here is the good and bad news.     If I have my device turned off, will I still receive text messages?      If a message is sent to you while your device is off, or while you're   traveling outside of the Verizon Wireless coverage area, your message   will be stored for later delivery. Your device must be turned back on   and have coverage for the message to be delivered to you. The network   will attempt to deliver the message for strongfive days (120 hours)/strong from the   date of receipt. Messages not delivered within five days will be   deleted.   If it is officially Deactivated at Verizon store (or web site) then you will get nothing   <comment153979> Deactivated by Verizon? if yes no you will not get them. Or did you Dad rightfully so just take out the battery ? <comment153981> Or did hi actually go to Verizon store to deactivate it?
