IOS 9.1 no longer syncs Exchange calendar <body> Mail, Contacts and Notes all sync fine but Calendar refuses to do so. I've tried deleting and recreating the account, resetting and everything else I can think of including my IT guys disabling normal and active sync on the corporate account and then enabling again, but still no Calendar sync. Can anyone help?
