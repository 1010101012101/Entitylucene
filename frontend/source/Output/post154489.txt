How do I get my computer name to show correctly in the finder? <body> I recently upgraded to Yosemite and following that upgraded to an SSD drive. Life is good and I am happy with everything except that since the upgrades I am seeing a silly variety of names for my computer.  I renamed it to The Shire and now it shows up as The Shire(2) or The Shire(3). No matter how many times I change it back in Preferences  Sharing, it keeps adding all those extra numbers. There are times when I see four or five different iterations of my system - see attached image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d5lsz.png" alt="enter image description here"  To add insult to injury, the old name of my system, the generic MacBook Pro (5) also shows in the list.  From what I have read this may have something to do with Bonjour, but I have not see any solutions out there for restoring order and correct names to list.  Sage advice is welcome.  <answer155074> I solved this annoying bug by unchecking 'Back to my Mac' and 'Find my Mac' in System Preferences/iCloud.   <comment182594> Alas doesn't work for me. <comment182677> I believe this is a Yosemite bug. Hopefully, it will get fixed in the 10.10.1 or 2 release.
