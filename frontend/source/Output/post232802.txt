Can't update Xcode <body> I am aware there are more questions with the same title, but I couldn't find any other post with this specific case.  I have XCode 7.0 and I want to update to the last version (7.3). But it doesn't appear in the updates page of the App Store. So, I searched for XCode in the App Store and clicked the little update button. The button remains pressed and a loop icon appears on the top. But it stays like that for hours and there's no sign it's updating.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QrweG.png" alt="enter image description here"  This doesn't seem to be working, I found in the internet that if I uninstall and reinstall it, it may work. But I don't want to lose all my projects.  <answer234461> Yes I always found updating XCode from the AppStore a painful experience.  Assuming you have an Apple ID*, you can bypass AppStore and download it directly using this link and then find the version of XCode you need.  As @Tetsujin says, also ensure you have an appropriate version of OSX to support the version of Xcode you are going to be running.  Note: * You no longer need a developer account, although you may want to consider this depending on the type of development you are going to be doing. See this Apple Developer page for details and links to create the appropriate account types. Note that you can start with a free Apple ID and upgrade later as necessary.  <answer236075> This can happen with any app if you have formerly downloaded the same app (i.e. With the same internal "bundle id") from emoutside/em the App Store.   Simply move the app to the Trash, restart the App Store app and try downloading the app again.  Trashing an app does never make you lose your settings or even project. This is not Windows (where Uninstallers are common - but even those often offer an option not to delete your data) ;)  <answer262654> In my case, I just had to upgrade to the latest macOS, since Xcode 7.3 requires El Capitan, just as Tetsujin pointed out.  <comment284487> What OS are you on? Xcode 7.3 requires El Capitan. <comment284508> @Tetsujin Thankss
