Portable Monitors for MacBook Pro? <body> I'm looking for a Portable Monitors for my macbook pro (possibily a 14'') Do you happen to know some model that is working on a mac?  I found this one (ThinkVision LT1421) but it does not work completely.  <answer70432> Every single USB monitor or video adapter I have ever seen uses the same DisplayLink chip and thus uses the same DisplayLink driver. While the Mac version of the driver does work, it unfortunately leaves much to be desired. So to answer your question... at the time of this writing, no, there is no strongUSB/strong monitor that works completely with OS X.   <answer70438> Have you tried the latest DisplayLink manager software? It is a bit of a battery-guzzler and has some limitations r.e. 3D acceleration, but may be an improvement on the native OS X driver.  <answer91172> The "Mini Displays" approach from Edovia appears to enable using an iPad as an external monitor (over Wifi), if your Mac runs 10.7 or later.  http://edovia.com/minidisplay/  <comment81728> The article you linked to says the monitor did work with a MacBook Pro. Why do you say it does not work completely? <comment81745> Because the article is not accurate. If you go to the controller site for the apple driver you'll see that it does not support OSX completely. <comment81769> I still need to buy a monitor. :) <comment81777> I think the only 14" choices you have are the ThinkVision and this Toshiba:(http://us.toshiba.com/computers/accessories/mobile-monitor/). You're stuck with 1366x768 or 1280x800 unless you step up to 22" or so, if resolution is an issue. This AOC (http://www.amazon.com/AOC-E1649FWU-USB-Powered-Portable-Monitor/dp/B005SEZR0G) has been reported as working fairly effortlessly in OS X, so that may be worth a look. <comment81781> thank you for the suggestion. I don't need specifically a 14''. I mean as long as it's not a 20+''. This AOC seems interesting but apparently in not available on amazon.co.uk <comment82018> The AOC seems to be in stock here (http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/AOC-e1649Fwu-16-LED-LCD-Monitor-16-9-16-ms/6195290/product.html?cid=133635). It's Â£128.45, but that does include the international shipping across the pond to the UK. <comment107073> There used to be a displaylink software solution using an iPad as a monitor over wifi.  Unfortunately not available anymore.
