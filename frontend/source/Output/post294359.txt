Move 1Password vault from old Mac to new Mac? <body> I did a clean install with a new hard drive in my MacBook, with old drive externally connected.   How do I move my 1Password vault from the old drive to the new drive?  ul listrongIs there a single file I can copy?/strong/li listrongIf no single file approach, will codeFile/code  codeBackup/code work?/strongbr /I have no idea how to do the restore. When I launch 1Password, it keeps asking for a "Secret Password" as well as a "Master Password". I have a "Master Password", but not a "Secret Password". Their documentation seems to suggest that the "Secret Password" is related to their newer online ongoing accounts. I have no interest in getting an online ongoing account, I only want the local storage option. /li listrongIs local "syncing" an option?/strongbr /Their documentation web site suggests "synching" a vault to a thumb drive. The doc talks about choosing the thumb drive in a "file browser", but their dialog box for "syncing" shows only a strange bread-crumb style path through several files. There is no way to redirect that bread-crumb path to the thumb drive. So I am stumped by that approach./li /ul  At this point I am giving up on 1Password, and just copy-pasting the passwords manually out to a text file. Surely there is a better way.  <answer294368> Yes, there's a much simpler way. In fact, you have a number of options, but based on your question I recommend the following:  strongOn your new Mac/strong  Do as follows:  ol liInstall 1Password on your new Mac/li liWhen it launches the first time you'll see a screen similar to the one below:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GeXPo.png" alt="screen shot of &quot;Used 1Password before?&quot; dialog box"  ol start="3" liSelect the emMore Options.../em option to reveal the emRestore from Backup/em option./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IimV2.png" alt="screen shot of &quot;Used 1Password before?&quot; dialog box, after clicking &quot;More Optionsâ€¦&quot;"  ol start="4" liClick on the kbdChoose Backup.../kbd button/li liNavigate to where 1Password has saved its automated backups on your old Mac (if your Macs are not networked, then copy the backup onto a Flash drive first and use this for the new Mac)/li liClick the kbdRestore/kbd button/li /ol  NOTE: As mentioned above there are a number of ways you can do this. You may want to read the How to move your 1Password data to a new computer or device for other options.
