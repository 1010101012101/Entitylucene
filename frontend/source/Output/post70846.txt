Applescript to type text, followed by a modifier key combo? <body> I want to use TextExpander to activate when I type the specific text "attached", and have the AppleScript type out the word "attached" (since TextExpander will remove it), and then invoke the keystroke Control-Z  I can get each to work individually, but not together. Here is the code I am using based off of code I found here:  precode    tell application "System Events"     keystroke "attached"     keystroke "z" using control down     end tell /code/pre  <answer70874> I'm not sure what the TextExpander application name and process name is so I will guess what it is.   precodeactivate application "TextExpander"     tell application "System Events"         tell process "TextExpander"             keystroke "attached"             delay 0.5             keystroke "z" using {command down}         end tell     end tell /code/pre  <answer144092> TextExpander has its own script-ability.

The delay and the Ctrl-Z actions work fine. <comment82317> If the edited version does not work, you may need to save it as an app, change the plist so it runs in the background and remove the tell process..
