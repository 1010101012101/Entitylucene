pcscd does not exist in /usr/sbin <body> I'm trying to install a USB certificate token on OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 (14B25) and the guides tell me to check that a certain daemon named pcscd is running and to start from code/usr/sbin/pcscd/code if not.  Here a link to the guide: http://wiki.infonotary.com/wiki/Installation_of_smart_card_reader_and_smart_card_drivers_in_Mac_OS_X#Manually_running_and_stopping_pcscd  However it does not exist.  I execute:  precodesh-3.2# cd /usr/sbin sh-3.2# ls -la |grep pcscd sh-3.2#  /code/pre  and as visible there is no file named codepcscd/code.  There is also no process called codepcscd/code when running  precodeps -a -u root /code/pre  Should I install some additional package for this one?  <answer168903> I managed to resolve this on my own.  Looks like the smartcard was actually working even if the pcscd executable is not present. Most probably the functionality was integrated into another service.  <comment197236> I think you need to install this https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/ <comment197397> Doesn't help - the file is still missing. It's very odd since I got pcsctest for example but not the daemon executable. <comment198306> Which guides show this? <comment198362> added a link to it
