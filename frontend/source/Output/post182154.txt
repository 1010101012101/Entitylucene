How do I enable logging for ssh log in attempts? <body> I have enabled remote logins via SSH on my Mac. But how do I enable logging of all log in attempts? And where is the log?  My code/etc/sshd_config/code has this content:  precode# Logging SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV /code/pre  <answer182166> Login attempts are logged in code/var/log/system.log/code  You'll be able to browse and filter for them through the Console.
