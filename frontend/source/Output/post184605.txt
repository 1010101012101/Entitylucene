Are there any apps for Mac that have Photos extensions? <body> Apple's website for the Mac version of photos.app states that external editors and filter apps (extensions) will be able to be used. The iPad version achieves this, but I note they don't seem to be reflected to the photo stream.  Are there any apps that support this functionality yet on the Mac?  <answer191075> Looks like this is coming in El Capitan; it was announced at WWDC.   Reported on multiple news sites, but an example snippet from here: "...support for third-party editing extensions that will be available from the Mac App Store and accessible within Photos itself. It doesnâ€™t sound as though that will enable external editing in Adobe Photoshop, say, but it will go a long way toward enhancing the editing capabilities of Photos."  <comment218905> For iOS: Photo Stream uploads a copy of the photo at the time it was added to your Camera Roll. Assuming the edits you make don't actually generate a new copy of the photo (like "Save as" would do on a computer), Photo Stream will not reflect changes. <comment218906> Also, the iOS photos app and Mac photos app are not the same thing. iOS Photos has had extensions since iOS 8 launched back in September 2014. <comment218971> The behaviour seems a bit inconsistent to me. I edited an existing old photo on my iPhone with ProCam today and those modifications made it right back to my Mac Photostream. Perhaps not all apps behave properly yet.
