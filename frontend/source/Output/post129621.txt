How do I change the color of my Dock on Mac <body> I am digging deep into my Mac's files to try and find how to change the color of my mac's dock. I have been able to change little things like the separator, indicator light, trash can, finder icon, etc. But I cannot find the file where the color of the actual Dock is.  I used this code to immediately go to the Dock folder  /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources  If you want a picture please ask and I'll edit a good one so you get the idea.  <answer129622> As far as I know, there's no image that you can change to change the background of the Dock. However, you can give the image to strongDockMod/strong which will let you change the background.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/260N6.png" alt=""  <comment151700> Check this http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1495519 <comment356452> Beware clicking the DockMod link; it appears the app is no longer maintained and the link prompts for Flash Player upgrade (likely indicator of malware). The company's website (Spryesoft) appears to no longer exist.
