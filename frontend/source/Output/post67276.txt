Displaying 'note keys/labels' on Garageband for iOS (specifically iPad) <body> I'm wondering if there is a way to display all the 'note letters' on the keys in the Keyboard on GarageBand for iOS.   At the moment it only displays the 'C notes' - for example C2, C3 and C4.   I have no 'music-based technical knowledge' or expertise and would appreciate any help in being able to see all the notes displayed.  Thanks for your help!  <answer68386> I'm pretty certain that there is no setting to overlay the note names on each key of the GarageBand-IOS keyboard. It's a reasonable question, and I found it repeated a couple of other times on discussion forums.  I submitted this to Apple as a feature request. I encourage you (and others) to do the same using this link.  <comment79572> Thanks for the response! This is an essential feature for new users.
