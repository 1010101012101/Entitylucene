Apple Bug Report (Apple's Response Time?) <body> I did a bug report because of this Xcode Situation ( Xcode.app gets scanned by socketfilterfw (OS X Firewall) at every launch ).  I wonder about the time emApple/em usually needs to respond.  Weeks, Months? I really have no clue.br If you know more (from your experience) please tell me.   <answer189127> There is no easy way to tell how/when/if Apple acts on your bug report. I have filed quite a few bug reports during the last years. Some still seem to be unchanged since I created them, some got closed silently and there is only one where I ever got notified that the fix would be in the next OS X release.  So basically you filed the report, now just ignore it :-)  <answer189155> Additionally, you should file your bug on Open Radar, that is a community maintain website who tries to keep as much reports public. A radar basically contains just the same information you report to Apple.  Note that, usually OSX/iOS developers ask for help regarding concrete radars, this is because "we suppose/believe" that if lots of people reports the same bug, it will be fixed soon. It's a common practice to report a bug on Apple bug tracker by just copying the radar report.  <answer235339> If you've developer account, you can try to report the bug at ï£¿ Bug Reporter with specific details of reproducing the issue. The time depends how on its emRank/em and whether the bug was described accurately.  If it's major issue, I believe it'll get the response fairly quickly.  <comment224131> Looking over the 15 bugs I've reported since 2005, I've never received a response from bugreport.apple.com. If the bug you're reporting is a common one, and thus Apple has many reports already, you'll never get a response. <comment224134> Thanks. Ah ok, I see. I thought they will somehow send me a mail lol silly me. But the status changed ? <comment224136> Thank you for this really helpful clarification! <comment224384> Thank you for the link and the useful information
