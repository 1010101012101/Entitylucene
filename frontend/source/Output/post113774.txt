Stuck on finishing import (from external hard drive to computer hard drive) <body> I started the process of importing my iPhoto library from an external hard drive to my Mac with a newly replaced hard drive.  I have roughly 180,000 photos and it looked like it was uploading all day.  Now it seems to be stuck on "finishing import".  Do I just wait?  Is this a lengthily process, too, or is it really just stuck?  <answer113776> If you are not sure if the process is actually doing something or just stuck, you can get an idea from the following  strongcodeActivity Monitor/code/strongbr code/Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app/code     ul liSee if the process is frozen. In that case activity monitor should show the process/App (iPhoto in your case) in red color. If it is red, there is a high probability that the app is "hung".  /li liSee if the process is actually doing something on the CPU or Hard Drive./li /ul  If you see something going on there, it is highly possible that it is still doing something.   If you don't see anything, you may want to check Console:    strongcodeConsole.app/code/strongbr code/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/code Console shows error messages that the app may have generated to give some idea on what is happening.  Note that both these are indicative and may not be 100% accurate. In the worst case you may have to import again (I would search Google for any issues with importing large iPhoto libraries before trying again)  This is a snapshot of my activity monitor, I have selected QuickSilver and it shows 59.0 MB Bytes Read and 27.6 MB under Bytes Written. This data is dynamically refreshed so you can get a fair idea of the disk usage of an app. The same for CPU. Memory may not be a very good indicator though, even if an app has frozen it may still use memory. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dhN0q.png" alt="Activity Monitor"  <comment155815> If you end up canceling this current import, I recommend the second time over importing the photos incrementally - say 40K at a time. That is a *huge* collection of photographs and the machine could get easily hung importing, caching, and indexing all the data being processed.
