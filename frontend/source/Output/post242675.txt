Store for old mac adapters <body> I'm traveling and hoping to quickly obtain a very old adapter in order to plug my 2006 MacBook Pro into a modern display. The laptop has a DVI port, which I believe is the only display output for it.   So I'm trying to obtain something like this DVI to VGA adapter or a DVI to HDMI adapter. The tricky thing is I need to obtain this in 32 hours for a job interview, so it looks as though mail order is not an option. Transferring files to another computer might be an option, but it would be a little more awkward.   Is there a brick and mortar store that carries mac adapters that are this old? In case it is relevant, I am in the Boston, MA area. Not sure if the official Apple Store would carry them anymore.   <answer242724> Best Buy has many adapters, including this DVI to HDMI converter.
