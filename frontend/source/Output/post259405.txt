Use iPad socket adapter with MacBook Pro charger <body> I have an iPad. Can I use its socket adapter (the part of the charger the connects to the socket) in my MacBook Pro charger   <answer259408> Yes. br /br / The socket adapter of iPad and Macbook Pro have the same standardb:(2.5A 250V~)/b.br /br / So they are interchangeable.  <comment334418> is the only difference the time of charging? I believe the iPad chargers ar 10W and the new Macbook pro chargers are 61W. How much of a performance difference will this make? Thx.
