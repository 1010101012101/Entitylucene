smartcard login <body> On my macos Sierra I can use smartcard to connect to web sites: the OS recognizes the smart card reader and the crypto api in my smart card.  I miss a step necessary to enable the login to the OS with smartcard with the pam.  When I run:  precode# sc_auth hash /code/pre  it doesn't print anything about the inserted smart card. I read about the codetokend/code service. Do I need it? How can I configure it?
