Can't sync photos from Windows to iPhone since iOS 6 <body> Since the update to iOS 6, my iPhone (or iTunes) does not copy the photos I have on my Windows system to the iPhone.  The update to iOS 6.0.1 doesn't seem to have helped.  I have removed all photos from both the iPhone and the sync area on the Windows system, but when I return the photos to the sync area, nothing gets copied to the iPhone.  How can I get my photo sync to work again?  <answer72467> Alright, I got it working again.  Something in the following ritual did the trick:  ul liremove all photos and videos from the sync directory on the Windows system/li lisync/li liempty out the directories on the iPhone visible through the windows explorer/li liremove all photos and videos from the iPhone/li lisync/li lirecreate the sync directory on the Windows system with all the directories and photos (except the "Thumbnails" folder) as you want them/li ligo back into iTunes while the iPhone is connected, note that the "sync photos" checkboxk is cleaerd, re-check and verify that iTunes is looking at the correct sync directory/li lisync/li /ul  ...and the photos are there.  I don't know which chicken-wave was the one which actually fixed the problem.  <answer171839> Use iTunes to manage your photos is not a good ideas, except your own a iMac and iPhoto.Some other software could make done.  ul liKoit Photo Manager/li liiExplorer/li /ul  If you can't be waiting, use iCloud to sync at "%HOME%\Pictures\iCloud Photos\My Photo Stream" and copy out
