Can't add events to iPhone calendar which are more than 1 year in the future <body> My iPhone 5c won't let me add any events to my locally stored calendar that are more than 1 year in the future. When I add them, they stay for 30 seconds or so and then disappear. Why is this happening and how can I fix it?  <answer230881> I think it's some kind of glitch in your phone or settings are not correct.  I checked on my iPhone 5, which runs iOS codev.9.2.1/code and event was saved even 3 years further. It's doesn't depend is it 1 year ahead, or 1 day ahead.  Try to troubleshoot:  ol liWhen you are in a Calendar App, click codecalendars/code button in the bottom, and make sure the proper calendar is selected with checkboxes./li liCheck if the settings of synchronization for calendars are correct. codeSettings/code-codeMail, Contacts, Calendars/code. /li liTry placing event to some other, closer date, closer than one year, if it doesn't work - proceed further./li liTry a Restart. Press and hold the codeSleep/Wake/code button for a few seconds until the red "slide to power off" slider appears, and then slide the slider. Press and hold the codeSleep/Wake/code button until the Apple logo appears./li liTry system update, check if there are newer versions of iOS codeSettings/code-codeGeneral/code-codeSoftware update/code./li liResetting your settings. You can also try resetting all settings. codeSettings/code-codeGeneral/code-codeReset/code-codeReset All Settings/code. You will have to enter all of your device settings again./li /ol  <comment281869> Where do you store your calendar, locally on the phone, in iCloud, with Google or somewhere else? <comment281871> Locally on the phone <comment281888> I checked in my iphone5, it runs on latest iOS, and I don't see any problems creating events further in the future. It seems it's either calendar synchronization issue, or some odd glitch.
