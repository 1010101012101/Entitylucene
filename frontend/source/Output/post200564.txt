How can I revert my etc/postfix/main.cf file? <body> I've already lost my etc/postfix/main.cf file in Yosemite. Could someone help me to revert or give me the link to download it?  <answer200565> If you've manipulated your main.cf already, check your backups to recover it.  Otherwise simply copy the default file: main.cf.default:  precodesudo copy /etc/postfix/main.cf.default /etc/postfix/main.cf /code/pre  and replace the last two lines with:  precodereadme_directory = /usr/share/doc/postfix inet_protocols = all message_size_limit = 10485760 mailbox_size_limit = 0 biff = no mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8, [::1]/128 smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks permit_sasl_authenticated permit recipient_delimiter = + tls_random_source = dev:/dev/urandom smtpd_tls_ciphers = medium inet_interfaces = loopback-only /code/pre  <comment241658> Also - Apple publishes this file on their open source site: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=main.cf+site:opensource.apple.com and before making further changes, consider enabling a local time machine and snapshotting things: `sudo tmutil enablelocal && tmutil snapshot` <comment242045> Thank for your all supports. I will going on with your helps.
