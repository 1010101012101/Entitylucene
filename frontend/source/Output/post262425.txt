Stuck Wifi Proxy Iphone jailbroken <body> When I was using proxymanager and I think I didn't remove the proxy before I uninstalled the tweak not when I join a new wifi network it auto proxy in manual. I have to remove the proxy everytime I join a new wifi network. Maybe there is a way to remove that in I file but I don't know the file where the proxy setting is. I tried to install the tweak again and it says there are no proxies but I am still getting auto proxy in the wifi settings.
