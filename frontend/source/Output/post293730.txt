Error -36 while copying .pkg from ftp server <body> I obtain an error     Some data can't be read or written (error code -36)   while copying a code.pkg/code file from an ftp server in Finder. I have read this related question. I have contacted the owner of the ftp server about this issue. Is there anything I can do myself?  <answer293765> You may want to try a dedicated FTP application, they tend to do a better job (in my experience) than using Finder for FTP copy. Also if you are comfortable in the command line you can do FTP there as well.   <comment370659> You may want to try a dedicated FTP application, they tend to do a better job (in my experience) than using Finder for FTP copy.

IIRC, a .pgk file is just a folder structure (invisible to the user). Use File  New Image  Image from Folder ... and create the .dmg, which is a monolithic file. Transfer the .dmg, then unpack on the other end. <comment370684> @SteveChambers Indeed, I was able to copy it using `FileZilla`. I invite you to repeat your comment as an answer, so I can accept it.
