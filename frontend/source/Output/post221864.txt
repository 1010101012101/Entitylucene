What is the function of each of the system location services in iOS? <body> I'd like to know what functionality I gain or lose by enabling / deactivating each of the services under Settings  Privacy  Location Services  System Services.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TM3yH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment268710> What are you hoping to gain? Locations Services is a single service running in the background, which optionally can be allowed to share its findings with those & other sub-systems. Switching any of those off simply stops that sub-system being able to access the data, it doesn't stop the data being collected. <comment269009> You are wrong. The sub-system will ask for that data and use up resources. For instance, the compass will only use location services if it is used and if it is allowed to use locations.
