Using the same partition for both Time Machine and other files <body> Is it harmful or dangerous to the other files in the same partition as the Time Machine?  Because a lack of storage, every time the Time Machine backs up my Mac, it deletes the oldest backup. Is there a danger that the Time Machine is about to delete my other files in this partition?

Plug in your Time Machine drive and open it in the Finder. You’ll see a folder named “Backups.backupdb”. Time Machine stores all its backup files under this folder. Just leave this folder alone and let Time Machine use it normally.      Place personal files and folders outside the Backups.backupdb folder. Don’t place anything inside the Backups.backupdb folder — Time Machine automatically deletes files and folders inside there to free up space, so you may find your personal files deleted if put them there.
