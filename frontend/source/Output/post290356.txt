How can I export all calendar entries from iCloud? <body> I'm trying to export my calendar for use in Magic Mirror (https://magicmirror.builders), but only one repeating entry is exported, even though I have many entries in my calendar. Is there a setting I'm missing?  I got the URL by going to iCloud calendar and sharing the calendar publicly, and I even looked at the data received by changing the protocol from webcal:// to http://, but I can't see my upcoming entries in the data received, so it's not a problem in the plugin. The entries show up properly in my iDevices and macOS Calendar.app.  <answer295826> Found a workaround for this:  ul liMake the calendar public in iCloud/li liOpen the Calendar.app on an iOS device/li liTap the Calendars button on the bottom and then the codei/code on the calendar you want to share/li liTap the codeShare Link.../code button and send the link to yourself somehow/li /ul  For some reason this link works fine, but the one from https://icloud.com doesn't.
