Trying to Find Photos on Harddrive from Photos App <body> Our hard drive died and we had to get a new one - I have my old hard drive in one of those NexStar things (bear with me as I am not that good at computers!).  I am looking for my photos from the Photo App and I can't seem to find them anywhere on the old hard drive to import onto our new hard drive.  Any ideas?  <answer226410> h2Finding the Library/h2  Pictures from photos are usually in a single big archive called codePhotos Library/code found in a user's codePictures/code folder. Go to the root of your hard drive (the root is what you see when you open it, before opening any folders inside it), and then open the following directories:  precodeUsers &gt; (your user name) &gt; Pictures /code/pre  The library should be there.  h2Opening the Library/h2  To open it, open Photos. The icon usually bounces into its place the Dock while Photos is loading the pictures, and then the window shows up. You will want to hold the kbdoption/kbd key before the window shows up (I usually do this by holding the kbdoption/kbd key when I click on the Photos icon). This will tell Photos you want to open another library, so instead of showing you the usual Photos window, it will open something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8GZt8.png" alt="Choose Library Window"  Click on that codeOpen Library.../code button and find your old library as described above.   <answer266075> I know this is most likely too late to be of use to you but I thought others in your situation might benefit from the information. The Photos application stores your movies and images inside a single database file that is located in the Pictures folder.  code/User/YOUR_USERNAME/Pictures/Photos Library.photolibrary/code  To get to your data you need to right-click on codePhotos Library.photolibrary/code, choose code"Show Package Contents"/code, and then look in the following locations:  Images:      /User/YOUR_USERNAME/Pictures/Photos    Library.photolibrary/resources/media/version   Video:      /User/YOUR_USERNAME/Pictures/Photos   Library.photolibrary/resources/media/master   Hope this helps!
