How can I change this name? <body> This strongxue/strong drives me crazy, I don't know where it come from, how can I change it? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tilZ2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer129530> It's the current user's home directory. It should correspond to the currently logged in user (shown in System Preferences  System  Accounts). The name strongxue/strong is the short name for the currently logged-in user.  If it's on your Mac and it isn't you and you don't recognise it, then you'd have to wonder who has an account on your Mac that you don't know about. Did you buy it secondhand maybe?  You can rename user accounts - see Apple's support website for more info.  <answer129532> That is your home folder. Since no other users are shown it must be that you named it that way.  To change it:  Open system preferences  Users  Unlock it (bottom left)  kbdctrl/kbd click (same as right click) on the account  Click on advanced options  Change the account name  Change the Home directory field to match the new name of the folder in /Users.  Click OK, and close the System Preferences screen.   Log out of the current administrator account, and into the original (renamed) account.  Here is a sample from my computer, only change the yellow marked fields, do not change anything else!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcKO1.png" alt="user"  <comment151591> It is your home folder ? <comment151597> That is your home folder - other users home folders will not have the house icon - and your screenshot does not show another users - what is your user name - shows in System Preferences - Users & Groups <comment151598> If you change the account name you also need to change the folder name on the disk and take care of a few other things. <comment151601> Since the folder has the 'home' icon, it's not just any home folder, it's the currently logged in user's home folder. <comment151918> Why so many down votes?
