OS X Photos App - disregarding shoot sequence, not sorting by time? <body> Normally strongPhotos/strong app shows me the pictures in the sequence I took them (captured in the file metadata from the camera).  However, this download, it shuffled all photos within each date.  It is doing emliterally/em what the option File/View/ "Keep Sorted by Date..." says - sorting by emdate/em only and ignoring emtimes/em.   strongPhotos/strong' floating Info box (Window/Info) shows correct date/time, so strongPhotos/strong emknows/em it is jumbling the pix.    I take pictures of many architectural details in a specific sequence, and I am relying on sequence to tell me which wheel is which.   I've tried clicking that option on and off. I've tried rebooting strongPhotos/strong.  I've tried exporting the originals, deleting all the photos, and importing the originals.  No dice.    Any idea how to prod strongPhotos/strong into sorting on time as well as date?br Photos is version 1.0.1 which is the latest patch supported by OS X 10.10.5.  The phone is an Android with recently added micro-SD card.  This is the first time strongPhotos/strong has been able to pull files off the micro-SD; previously I had to manually drag them out with Android File Transfer. Filenames are like 20160914_193153.jpg. They sort correctly in Finder.
