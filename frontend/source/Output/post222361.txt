Where are drivers installed on the Mac <body> Where are USB serial drivers installed on the Mac? How can I check which drivers are installed, and how do I remove a driver?  <answer222367> Hardware Drivers in OS X are typically in the form of Kernel Extensions and the primary location is code/System/Library/Extensions//code however they can also be within an Application Bundle. You can use codekextunload/code to unload a Kernel extension.  To see what Kernel extensions are loaded use the codekextstat/code command in a Terminal.  Have a look at the manual page KEXTUNLOAD(8) and also the strongUnloading a Kernel Extension with kextunload/strong section in How to Load &amp; Unload Kernel Extensions in OS X, excerpt show below.     strongUnloading a Kernel Extension with kextunload/strong      Unloading a kernel extension from OS X is basically the exact same as   loading a kext, except youâ€™ll use the kextunload utility with sudo as   follows:  precodesudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.ExampleBundle /code/pre      Or by pointing directly to the kernel extensions path:  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/ThirdPartyMystery.kext /code/pre      Again, you can confirm the kernel extension has been unloaded by using   kextstat and grep, where it should return nothing.   <comment269425> As far as I know... all the drivers are stored in System/Library/Extensions...  but can't really comment to the rest, so only making this a comment.
