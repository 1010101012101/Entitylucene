iPhone app that displays temperature as a notification badge <body> I'm looking for an app similar to Fahrenheit, that gives a notification badge indication of the current temperature.  A problem with Fahrenheit that I have is that it's too slow in updating.  I need something that updates the badge at least every 30 minutes (so I don't have to open up the app to get it to refresh).  <answer72174> The app Weather Live has the ability to show the current forecasted temperature on the application badge.  I haven't tested it myself, but it seems promising. Not free, though.  <answer72177> There are several Weather Apps that perform this function. The one I am currently using (as I live in Canada and it has good Canadian weather support) is Degrees.  You could also try Weather Live or eWeather HD. I'm sure there are many more.  One limitation of those badges, if you live in a part of the world like mine, is lack of negative numbers in the badge. Since I use Celsius, this is an issue even this time of year. :)
