Mounting SMB network share from Mavericks recovery mode <body> I would like to be able back up my macbook on a weekly basis doing the following:  ul liboot into recovery mode/li limount a windows SMB network share/li liuse disk utility to save a disk image to the network share/li lipossibly automate this process/li /ul  This seems like it should be possible however when I try and mount the SMB share I get this error message:  precode-bash-3.2# mount_smbfs dyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SMBClient.framework/Versions/A/SMBClient    Referenced from: /sbin/mount_smbfs    Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  I have also attempted to copy the framework folder from the main system volume. However the recovery partition is read-only.  Am I incorrectly trying to mount the SMB share or do I have to make a custom recovery image thats supports SMB?  <answer221883> This is, because the binary for the framework thatâ€™s required is not part of the Recovery System.  I have been trying various things for over an hour now and the only thing that works appears to be AFP:  precodemkdir /Volumes/VOLUMENAME mount_afp afp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@000.00.000.00/VOLUMENAME /Volumes/VOLUMENAME  /code/pre  One important thing that kept this from working for me was that I had used code/Volumes/VOLUMENAME/code instead of the correct code/VOLUMENAME/code in the afp URL.
