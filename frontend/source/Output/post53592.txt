How I can start mongodb automatically? <body> I'm doing like here is described   http://hunterford.me/mongodb-startup-item/  but my file called different and path is here code~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist/code. and mongo is starting well, but after system restart i have go through two last command again  precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.mongo.mongod.plist sudo launchctl start org.mongo.mongod /code/pre  <answer53629> If you have to use sudo to load it, the plist file may be owned by root. Launchd will only automatically load agents that emyou/em own from ~/Library/LaunchAgents, where it will load agents owned by root from /Library/LaunchAgents.  You can do codels -l ~/Library/LaunchAgents/code to view the ownership of the plist. If you actually want it to run under your user account, you can change it's ownership:  precodesudo chown `whoami` ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist /code/pre  However, if you need to run mongod as root, you should leave the plist in /Library/LaunchDaemons  <comment61376> Is there anything preventing you from configuring MongoDB exactly the same way as described in the linked article? <comment63050> thank you very much this is exactly what i'm looking for.
