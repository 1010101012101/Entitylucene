Universal Clipboard doesn't work anymore <body> First time I've installed Sierra a couple of months ago, I tried the universal clipboard with my iPhone 6. It worked immediately like a charm and since I used it, I found this feature really useful for many use-cases.  Unfortunately, this feature doesn't work anymore after I upgraded from a 2 year old iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 Plus.  I know what I need for that feature to work (as it used to work fine):  ul liBoth devices are connected with my iCloud account (same Apple ID)/li liBluetooth and Wifi are turned ON on both devices /li liBoth devices are connected to the same Wifi network /li liBoth devices are next to each other (less than 1 meter). /li liiMAC 10.12.3 (16D32) /li liiPhone 7 IOS 10.3/li /ul  Both iMac and iPhone have been rebooted a couple of times.  No text, no URL, no picture can be copied &amp; pasted from one device to the other anymore.  Any thought what could be wrong with the new iPhone 7?  <answer278969> Turn strongcontinuity/strong (=handoff) on for both devices, and also make sure they are logged into strongthe same iCloud account/strong.  Relevant documentation on Apple's website.  <comment351113> Do all devices have have Handoff (continuity) turned on? <comment351192> Thank you, Handoff was off on the iPhone. It's working back like a charm. yves <comment352250> Glad it worked out for you! I would appreciate if you could accept my answer then :)
