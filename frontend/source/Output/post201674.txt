Can I play audio from computer through VOIP connection? <body> I'm using join.me for online presentations. If I have a video I'd like to share, I can't send the sound to join.me. I was thinking perhaps some Soundflower set up might enable this function. Any ideas about that, or other ways to send audio to a VOIP-type connection online?  <answer201678> I am open to other thoughts, but did find this:  http://support.citrixonline.com/en_US/Meeting/knowledge_articles/000187248?title=Attendees+Unable+to+Hear+Audio+When+Playing+a+Video+(Mac+Presenter)
