Reminders won't sync to iPhone <body> Running iOS 8.1 on an iPad mini, Yosemite on an Air, and 8.1 on a 5C.  For whatever reason, the 5C has stopped syncing reminders to/from iCloud. Works fine between the iPad and Air.  So far I've tried disabling reminder sync on the iPhone (not entire iCloud), and rebooted. When I open Reminders now everything is gone (expected) but none of the lists sync down. Reminders is stuck in a state where the only visible button is the "New List +" section, which does not react to taps.  If I turn off sync and open the app, I'm presented with "New List +" and a default empty "Reminders" sheet.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Reminders then sync'ed.   <answer191623> I had the same problem, until I realized that the in the iPhone's iCloud settings, Reminders is unchecked by default. So all I did - on my iPhone - was go to Settings  iCloud and then just activate Reminders. Within a few seconds all my Reminders between my iPhone and Mac were synced.
