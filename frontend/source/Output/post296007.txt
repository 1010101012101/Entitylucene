Crash with error "No more room to grow table" <body> For the past week or so my computer has been crashing at least once a day with the same error.  precode*** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff8018318b7f): "No more room to grow table: 0x0xffffff8018ab3e00 size:262142, used:262141, requested elem:1"@/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/xnu/xnu-3248.60.10/osfmk/kern/waitq.c:594 Backtrace (CPU 2), Frame : Return Address 0xffffff802e83bd60 : 0xffffff80182dab52 0xffffff802e83bde0 : 0xffffff8018318b7f 0xffffff802e83be60 : 0xffffff8018316122 0xffffff802e83be70 : 0xffffff80182d43ac 0xffffff802e83bee0 : 0xffffff80182d1bb8 0xffffff802e83bf10 : 0xffffff80183b8eca 0xffffff802e83bfb0 : 0xffffff80183ecd86  BSD process name corresponding to current thread: Google Chrome He  Mac OS version: 15G31  Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 15.6.0: Thu Jun 23 18:25:34 PDT 2016; root:xnu-3248.60.10~1/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: B5AA8E3E-65B6-3D0E-867B-8DCCF81E536C Kernel slide:     0x0000000018000000 Kernel text base: 0xffffff8018200000 __HIB  text base: 0xffffff8018100000 System model name: MacBookPro11,5 (Mac-06F11F11946D27C5)  System uptime in nanoseconds: 12138432578219 /code/pre  I've wiped the drive and re-installed El Capitan but I'm still getting the same issue.  I use this machine for software development, so there's a good amount of CPU and memory intense operations, a couple virtual environments, and I run Chrome Canary, Chromium, and Chrome which I know are big hogs as far as browsers go.  However, when running low on memory before I recall there being a dialog window that "Your system is low on memory" and I was able to close programs before a crash.  What would be causing this issue?  Hardware failure?  Memory leak in a program?  I notice that last process name is codeGoogle Chrome He/code so maybe it's just time I switch browsers...  <answer296179> Seems it's a Google Chrome issue and the team is working on a fix.  Check this issue.  <comment373817> It seems to be the Google Chrome Helper process.  Have you tried removing Chrome to see if the problem goes away? <comment374063> What version of Chrome you have? I have the same problem and mine is `62.0.3192.0 dev` <comment374167> I run Chrome `60.0.3112.101 (Official Build) (64-bit)`, Chromium `62.0.3194.0 (Developer Build) (64-bit)`, and Chrome Canary `62.0.3194.0 (Official Build) canary (64-bit)`.  I've switched to Safari, Firefox, and Opera and haven't had any crashes, so I think it's just an issue with Chrome's software, though I haven't narrowed down which one. <comment374168> Well I'm relieved it doesn't appear to be an issue with my machine, then.  I've stopped using Chrome and for the past few days haven't had any crashes, so definitely the culprit.
