How to make ffmpeg use correct libfreetype version? <body> I have a PHP application that uses ffmpeg with libfreetype.  I installed both ffmpeg and libfreetype from macports.  But I keep getting this error:  precode2013-08-30 14:44:21 - Generate poster - Create thumbnail using ffmpeg. 2013-08-30 14:44:21 - Generate poster - FFMpeg lib found. dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib   Referenced from: /opt/local/bin/ffmpeg   Reason: Incompatible library version: ffmpeg requires version 17.0.0 or later, but libfreetype.6.dylib provides version 15.0.0 /code/pre  codeotool -L /opt/local/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib/code shows   precode/opt/local/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib (compatibility version 17.0.0, current version 17.2.0) /code/pre  But I also noticed another version on the system.  codeotool -L /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib/code shows  precode/usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib (compatibility version 15.0.0, current version 15.1.0) /code/pre  So I suspect maybe ffmpeg is trying to use that library.  But I'm not sure.  Any ideas how to fix this?  <answer100541> Try to reinstall with Homebrew instead of macports..? I have had too many dependency issues when using macports.   precodebrew install ffmpeg /code/pre  If you have problems (you shouldn't on a clean Homebrew install) check the answer here.  <comment131129> did you work out how to fix this issue? <comment131192> No.  I followed the errors for a long time, installing one dependency after another, and I got stuck at some point.  Eventually I resorted to letting this particular PHP app use a very old version of ffmpeg (0.5) that the developer recommended, and then it works. <comment131193> do you use mamp by any chance? I found that commenting out everything in /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/envvars did the trick because the binaries were using the MAMP versions of the tools and not the installed versions. <comment131205> I actually use XAMPP.  Maybe the same issue.  Idk I already gave up on it.  Thanks for the tip though, hopefully this will help someone else.
