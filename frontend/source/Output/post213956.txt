What is libgio and how can I update my library? <body> I downloaded a plugin for gimp, but when I execute this, I get:br Reason: Incompatible library version: gmic_gimp requires version 4201.0.0 or later, but libgio-2.0.0.dylib provides version 4001.0.0  But does anyone know what libgio stands for?  I know it is a library file, but I don't know how to upgrade my library version  <comment258322> Did you update your GIMP to the latest version? <comment258521> yes i have the latest version
