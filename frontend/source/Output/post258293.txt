Applications stuck after quit <body> I have had an issue for a bit now where after I quit or force quit some applications they can get left in the dock (they are also in the force quit dialog and application switcher) with only the option to force quit which does nothing this happens with play on mac and any processes I launch from the terminal. The big issue is it is stopping me from shutting down easily as there will always be applications running which can't be destroyed.  I am running 10.11.6  <comment322861> "some applications"? Which applications. Also, if you need to force quit, there's already something wrong. Test on a new admin account, see if the behaviour is the same. <comment322862> It happens with Play On Mac it also happens using normal wine and most processes I launch from terminal for example if I make an application with SDL and launch it it will be left in the dock after quitting.
