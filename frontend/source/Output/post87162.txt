Is there a reader for iPhone or iPad that supports many formats? <body> I'm looking for a reader application that can open many ebook formats, specifically I am looking for pdf, djvu, epub, fb2 and txt.  <answer87271> Book Reader Pro is what you are looking for. The ebook file format support is outstanding. The supported file formats are  PDF/EPUB/CHM/DJVU/FB2/CBZ and XPS.  Stanza would be another good choice but I'm not sure about it file format support.  <comment102002> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please add some details about why you are recommending this apps and which of the formats asked for they support. The idea is for the answer to stand alone.
