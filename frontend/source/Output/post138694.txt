what is access_bpf group? <body> Does anyone know what the "access_bpf" group is / does. I noticed it when I went into Preferences  Users &amp; Groups.  I've searched around and found that it has something to do with Wireshark, however I have not installed the program on my Mac so I'm too sure how the group got added.  <answer138695> The Installer for Wireshark will create the access_bpf group! or in your case who knows :)  Since you do not remember installing and do not use it then just remove it.  To remove Wireshark from your machine, look for following files on your Mac and remove them if they exist:  precodesudo rm -r /Applications/Wireshark.app sudo rm -r /Library/Wireshark sudo rm /Library/StartupItems/ChmodBPF sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.wireshark.ChmodBPF.plist sudo rm /Library/Application\ Support/Wireshark/ChmodBPF/ChmodBF sudo rm /Library/Application\ Support/Wireshark/ChmodBPF/org.wireshark.ChmodBPF.plist /code/pre  Also remove the access_bpf group  <answer138728> Wireshark's installer configures your system so that the user doing the installation can capture network traffic without the capturing program having to run as root.  The way it does this is to:  ul licreate an codeaccess_bpf/code group;/li liput the user into that group;/li liinstall a StartupItem (in older versions) or a launch daemon (in newer versions) that, when the system is booted, changes the permissions of the BPF devices to rw-rw--- and the group owner of the BPF devices to codeaccess_bpf/code;/li liarranges that the StartupItem/launch daemon run at that time./li /ul  Note, BTW, that this also allows you to capture traffic with Wireshark (or Wireshark's TShark or dumpcap programs) without having to run them as root, it also allows you to capture traffic with tcpdump without having to run it as root.  <answer154858> Navigate to System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - Unlock it as Admin - open the field Groups under Users - select and delete.  Or via terminal with  precodesudo dscl . -delete /Groups/access_bpf /code/pre  <comment163640> good search :) the Wireshark is the one making that Group. Since you do not remember installing it it might have been someone else.
