mountain lion & vmware fusion bridged ethernet issue <body> I am running Mountain Lion and I have gone back to using VMWare Fusion to run my local development environment.    However I had added a second network adaptor within VMWare Fusion and I am setting it to use the bridged ethernet, however the little light next to it is always red, is there something I am doing wrong or need to enabled something on the guest OS ?   <comment77546> Are you running the last version of VMWare Fusion compatible with Moutain Lion ? Why did you need to add a second network adaptor on your virtual machine ?
