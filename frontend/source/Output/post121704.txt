Songs on iPhone I never put there <body> There are song on my iPhone that i never put there. Only the playlist iPhone and Purchased are activated and those songs are not on that list. And somehow, I can't remove them. Anybody help?  <answer121788> Look for a little cloud icon to the right of the song name... That mean's it's iTunes match. I had a bunch of songs I would never have gotten on my phone that kept coming up in genius shuffles. Turning off iTunes match did the trick.  <comment141905> Do you have iTunes Match enabled? Do you sync your iPhone with your computer sometimes? <comment171821> I have the same problem and don't have iTunes Match enabled.
