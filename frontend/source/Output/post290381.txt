How to get the recovery steps from the forgot Apple ID feature? <body> I have a friend who forgot her Apple ID password, so I helped her with the emforgot Apple ID/em steps. She already put her Apple ID into two-factor authentication, so after entering her Apple ID the Apple website sent a 6-digits verification number to her trusted number, which came in form of an SMS.   However, the trusted number tied with her Apple ID is currently on an Android phone. Her iPhone has a different number now. After entering the 6-digits, Apple's website told us that it has sent the instruction for resetting her Apple ID password to her trusted number. Well, it's now been days and we still haven't received any instructions on her Android phone which hosted the trusted number.   We tried repeating the emforgot password/em steps again, and are stuck with the same problem.   How can we get the recovery instructions we need?
