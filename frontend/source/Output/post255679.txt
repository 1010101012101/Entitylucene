"geodMachServiceBridge" errors in Console App <body> "geodMachServiceBridge" errors show up every few seconds in the Console App in macOS Sierra. Quitting process from within Activity Monitor didn't help. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G0Ely.png" alt="enter image description here" Tried this solution (from here), didn't help too:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.geodMachServiceBridge.plist launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.geodMachServiceBridge.plist /code/pre  Shows following error:     Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged   Googling relevant names "com.apple.GeoServices" and "GEODiskSpaceManager" didn't return any valuable results as well.  Before trying to disable SIP, decided to ask the community if anyone have any useful info. Thanks.
