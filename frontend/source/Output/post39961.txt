Is there a way to turn on and off the Mouse Keys feature using AppleScript or a terminal command? <body> I'm running Mac OS X 10.7.2. Is there a way to run an AppleScript or terminal command that quickly turns on or off the "mouse keys" feature under the Universal Access tab? Ideally I'm looking for a solution that doesn't involve GUI scripting the System Preferences app, although that would be slightly better than nothing.  I've explored codedefaults write com.apple.universalaccess useMouseKeysShortcutKeys 1/code and various other forms of that statement, but to no avail.  <answer39962> Can't you use keystroke scripting in AppleScript for this?  Something along the lines of:  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat 5 times     //any of these should work     key option     key code 58     key code option     //I do not know if this works     keystroke option end tell /code/pre  <answer39965> Here's the GUI scripting solution:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "Mouse" of pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"     tell application "System Events"         tell process "System Preferences"             tell first window                 tell first tab group                     tell radio group 1                         if value of radio button 1 is 1 then                             # enabled, so disable                             click radio button 2                         else                             # disabled, so enable                             click radio button 1                         end if                     end tell                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell     quit end tell /code/pre  It will launch emSystem Preferences/em if required, but doesn't show the window and quits it afterwards, so from a UI POV, it at least doesn't show the window.  hr  You can change the persistent setting on which the System Preferences configuration is based using the following commands:  precodedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriver -bool YES defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriver -bool NO /code/pre  Unfortunately, this only changes the configuration file and does not apply the changes to the running system.  hr  While you can programmatically press emOption/em keys using AppleScript, like the following:  precodetell application "System Events"     key down option     key up option end tell /code/pre  The empress Option five times to toggle/em setting is at a higher level and doesn't get triggered by this. While all regular codeOption/code key presses are ignored after you only run codekey down option/code, you can still toggle Mouse Keys.  hr  Debugging emSystem Preferences/em while changing the setting shows calls to codeLaunchUAServerIfNeeded/code and codeUAMouseKeysSetEnabled/code in the private codeUniversalAccessCore/code framework. Unless we reverse engineer that framework and write our own binaries, I don't think we'll get a proper programmatic way to do this.  <comment45192> No, sadly, as far as I can tell, option is a modifier, not a scriptable keystroke. <comment45193> @Daniel The commands would be `key down option` and `key up option`, but don't work, even with `delay 0.1` between each. <comment45194> @Daniel Did you try it? <comment45195> I did. Didn't trigger the switch when run. Be careful to never mismatch a pair of these when you try. AFAIK it's impossible to release a key pressed this way unless with the correct `key up`. <comment45196> Yes I tried and no, it doesn't work. :-( <comment45202> A phenomenal answer that only got better with the edit. Well done! <comment115640> how do you find out what the anchors are called? I guessed 'Keyboard' and 'Hearing' but I can't seem to guess what the anchor name for the Seeing tab should be. It's not Seeing, Sight, Vision.... What I'm really curious about is how to find them, without guessing.
