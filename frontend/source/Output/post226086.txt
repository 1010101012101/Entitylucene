Create new @me.com mail account (2016) <body> Every articles/answers I found are dated around or prior 2012. So I'd like to know: is there any tested way to create a new @me.com mail account right now?  <answer226087> Since mobileMe (which handed out the @me.com addresses) was turned off some time ago, all you can now create are @icloud.com emails. If you had an AppleID which predates mobileMe (e.g. a dot Mac account) you would have three aliases:  ul limyname@mac.com/li limyname@me.com/li limyname@icloud.com/li /ul  So the short answer is, no it is not possible to create a new @me.com email address anymore.
