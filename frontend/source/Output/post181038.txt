What is a good application for creating and managing a survey? <body> I need to type in my computer the results of a survey I did. I have dozens of questions and, so far, 10 series of answers. That's a lot a data, and I wonder if there exists a specific application, on OS X, to create and/or manage surveys, polls, "market research".  So far, I am using Numbers.  <comment215228> @Buscar They're web apps, not OS X apps, and they're survey apps for managing survey data collection rather than analysis. <comment215230> @grgarside I know that, do you have a suggestion ? <comment215237> what is the form/format of your current data (can you import them) ? <comment215239> The format is paper! <comment215240> @grgarside I think a web app is more convenient for my needs. I might create a survey online and then type the data I got today (on paper) in the web app. See also my related question [there](http://superuser.com/questions/901961/what-are-the-cheap-and-best-online-tools-for-creating-surveys)... which is being closed :( <comment215241> @Colas Perhaps you want [webapps.stackexchange.com](http://webapps.stackexchange.com) or [softwarerecs.stackexchange.com](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com)â€”questions here specialise more for native iOS/OS X apps? <comment215272> @grgarside thanks for your help! Are you sure super user is only for Apple? <comment215283> This is not superuser, and superuser is not only for Apple products, no. <comment215310> Oops you are right ! @tubedogg <comment215355> @Colas Take a look at these online software: http://www.capterra.com/survey-software/
