OSX El Capitan Unable to add exchange account <body> I had a problem with Lync because of which I went to Keychain Access  Preferences  Reset My Default Keychain.  After that all of my passwords were reset and I had to enter them again. When I was trying to enter the password for my EXCHANGE accounts, it didn't work and I deleted these accounts (hoping i can recreate them).  Once I try to recreate the EXCHANGE accounts, it will connect with the server and then show the option of Mail, Calendar, Notes, Reminders. Once I click DONE, the spinner spins but nothing happens and I can only cancel to go out. The accounts aren't created.   This is happening for both exchange accounts.  I went to CONSOLE and checked the log files and I found this entry:  precode7/20/15 4:46:56.840 PM com.apple.preferences.internetaccounts.remoteservice[586]: __56-[ACUIViewController persistVerifiedAccountWithActions:]_block_invoke_3:103 -- *** Failed: Error Domain=com.apple.accounts Code=13 "Unable to store credential due to error -25291 Requested By: 586" UserInfo=0x7fe8fed589e0 {NSLocalizedDescription=Unable to store credential due to error -25291 Requested By: 586, NSUnderlyingError=0x7fe8fea22120 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.apple.accounts.keychain error -25291.)"} /code/pre  From the error, it seems to be a keychain error because the package com.apple.accounts.keychain is involved in it.  Any idea on how this can be fixed?  <comment235054> Thank you for taking the time to ask your question. Unfortunately we do not allow per-released products questions.
