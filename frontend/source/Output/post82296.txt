Send Wake-On-Lan packets from Mac to Nas for TimeMachine backups <body> I have a NAS box that is "Wake On Lan" enabled. I'm struggling to find a way for to utilise this with my TimeMachine backups from my Mac (Mountain Lion).  My intention is that may Mac will wake the sleeping Nas when TimeMachine backups are scheduled.  Has anybody got any experience of sending magic packets from a mac to a nas? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers  Noel  <answer91886> I resolves this by the using an answer from this question that links to this blog post, and incorporating this Wake UP NAS applescript into the automator app (Changing the MAC and local broadcast IP address to suit)  Wake Up Nas Script:  precodedo shell script "python -c \" import socket data = '\\xff'*6+'\\x00\\x13\\xd4\\xdc\\xf2\\x80'*16 s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1) s.sendto(data, ('192.168.1.255', 80))\"" /code/pre  The automator app is as follows:  precodepause 10 seconds run the above WakeUpNas script pause 4 mins (let the nas start up if needs be) Get Specified Servers (add the servers that you want to wake) Connect to Servers /code/pre  Then adding the above App to the startup items to reconnect to drive when the Mac restarts.  By following the blog post you can also call the app when the computer wakes from sleep by installing Sleepwatcher and a little extra work.
