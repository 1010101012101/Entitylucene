Installing Windows 7 without DVD/Flash Drive - step 6: no permission? <body> I am following this guide, but cannot add the virtual hard disk at step 6. I get a 'No permission' pop-up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qUpdJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I grant myself permission?   <answer252805> One of the commands, given in step 5 that prevents this error message from occurring, is repeated  below.  precodesudo  chown  $USER  bootcamp*.vmdk /code/pre  This command changes ownership from the coderoot/code user to the current user. In your case, I assume the current user is named codeNick/code. To verify you entered this command correctly, you can enter the command below. Here I assume your current directory still is code~/Documents/VirtualBox/code.  precodels -l bootcamp* /code/pre  In your case, the output should appear as shown below.  precodecd ~/Documents/VirtualBox ls -l bootcamp* -rw-------  1 Nick  staff  37376 14 sep 15:43 bootcamp-pt.vmdk -rw-------  1 Nick  staff    682 14 sep 15:43 bootcamp.vmdk /code/pre  From your comments, I assume this is what you currently would get.  precodecd ~/Documents/VirtualBox ls -l bootcamp* -rw-------  1 root  staff  37376 14 sep 15:43 bootcamp-pt.vmdk -rw-------+ 1 root  staff    682 14 sep 15:43 bootcamp.vmdk /code/pre  This output shows you are not the current owner of these files. Additionally, the code+/code character indicates you have added extended security information such as an access control list.  Another one of the commands, given in step 5 that prevents this error message from occurring, is repeated  below.  precodesudo  chmod  go+rw  $PARTID /code/pre  In step 5, a warning is given, which is repeated below.     Note: This access granted by the chmod command will only last until OS X is rebooted.   BTW, the command without the variable is given below.  precodesudo  chmod  go+rw  /dev/disk0s4 /code/pre  One way, to verify you enter the codechmod/code command correctly, would be to enter the following command.   precodels -l /dev/disk0s4 /code/pre  In your case, the expected output is shown below.  precodebrw-rw-rw-  1 root  operator 1, 4 14 sep 15:38 /dev/disk0s4 /code/pre  h2The most likely causes of your problem are given below./h2  ul liYou are not using the default codebash/code shell./li liYou did not enter the codechown/code command./li liYou did not enter the codechown/code command correctly./li liYou were the coderoot/code user when you entered the codechown/code command./li liYou added extended security information to the file entries./li liYou did not enter the codechmod/code command./li liYou did not enter the codechmod/code command correctly./li liYou rebooted the operating system./li /ul  <comment314679> I am doing exactly what the guide tells me to do. No reboot, entered the code once more, got 'disk0s4 was already unmounted' as a result. I still get the same message afterwards. <comment314700> What does `ls -l /dev/disk0s4` show the file mode (permissions) to be? <comment314721> The result I get is:  `brw-rw-rw-  1 root  operator    1,   4 14 sep 15:38 /dev/disk0s4`  Thank you for your help in the past few days, David. Really appreciate it, as it may seem whiney to keep asking questions. <comment314725> That looks OK. What does `ls -l bootcamp*` show for ownership? I assume your current directory is `~/Documents/VirtualBox`. <comment314834> `ls -l ~/documents/virtualbox/bootcamp*` gives `-rw-------  1 root  staff  37376 14 sep 15:43 /Users/Nick/documents/virtualbox/bootcamp-pt.vmdk` as well as `-rw-------+ 1 root  staff    682 14 sep 15:43 /Users/Nick/documents/virtualbox/bootcamp.vmdk` . <comment314895> This time you have the wrong output.
