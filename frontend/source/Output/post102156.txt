Can Homebrew be used to install AppleScript bundles? <body> Can Homebrew be used to install AppleScript bundles?  If so, what sorts of conventions would the project need to follow?  Would it need to include a make.scpt file compile the code.applescript/code files?  I'm assuming that it could reference Github projects.  ** edit **  homebrew-cask is probably the right tool for this; I submitted an issue.
