How do I stop the Address Book folder in Library from getting so large? <body> I was trying to find more space on my hard drive, and when I looked at my Library  Application Support  AddressBook the size was over 17 GB.  The folder inside called Sources had some folders with arbitrary alphanumeric names.  Inside those folders were Images folders with what looked like photos for the Contacts app.  Problem is that it is copying the same images every day, without deleting the previous day.  How do I stop this from happening?
