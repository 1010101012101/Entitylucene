Mail.app not showing the "synchronize" option for an IMAP account <body> I have 6 different IMAP accounts configured on Mail (all of them for gmail / google apps accounts).  All of them, strongexcept one/strong, have a "Synchronize" option in the menu that appears when right-clicking any of the inboxes or other IMAP folders in the left pane.  This one account which doesn't have this option also has occasional major lags in syncing with the server.  emALL of the account settings are identical/em (including enabling of IDLE).  Any ideas what could be causing this and how to resolve?  <answer130549> Look for it in the Mail--Mailbox--Synchronization  if not there..  Sounds like when setting up that account something went wrong  reset that account  remove it and add it new  <comment153017> does it show in the list under mailbox tab -synchronize <comment153037> @Buscarì›ƒ which "tab" are you referring to?
