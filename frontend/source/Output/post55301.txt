How can I "mark as spam" in Sparrow for iOS? <body> I have labels, archive, trash, respond, etc. but can't find any way to tag a message as spam on the iPhone version.  <answer55302> From the messages list, swipe left on the message to mark as spam, tap on the label icon, and select Spam.  <comment63510> funny - I don't think of it as a label, so I didn't look there.   Perfect. <comment63572> Yes, it is not as obvious at it probably should be.
