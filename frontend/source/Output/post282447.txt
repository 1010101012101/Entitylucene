Is it possible to put the list of desktops in Mission Control on the bottom of the screen? <body> So when I swipe up with three fingers and it shows me everything on my current desktop and on the top it has this bar with all the other desktops, is it possible to have that bar display on the bottom rather than the top?  <comment355794> Since I'm not absolutely sure, I'll just say this in a comment. I do not believe you can change the position on the screen of the displayed list of Desktops while in Mission Control.
