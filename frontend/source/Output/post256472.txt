chatty "switching to keychain-db" console messages in Sierra <body> In macOS Sierra I'm noticing a very "chatty" and repetitive series of warnings in the console, like this:  precodedefault 15:27:23.330990 -0700   AppleIDAuthAgent    switching to keychain-db: /Users/XYZ/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db from /Users/XYZ/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db (0 1 1 1) /code/pre  where dozens of processes are all logging the same "switching to keychain-db" message over and over again. These messages are coming from AppleIDAuthAgent, authd, secinitd, lcd, Finder, gamed, Mail, cloudd, and on and on.  Not only that, but notice in the log message it's switching from and to the exact same file and path. The entire thing makes no sense.  Anyone know what this is all about?  <comment319935> Are you having problems with passwords or the Keychain app. <comment323339> I have the exact same issue. It's extremely verbose. <comment328298> I'm getting about 200 a minute. Almost all of them end with `(0 1 1 1)` but a few end with `(0 1 0 0)`. Additionally, while almost all of them are "switching" to and from the same exact path, a few log messages say it's switching from `...login.keychain` rather than `...login.keychain-db`. They are also usually followed by another log message with the text `not switching as we're not in ~/Library/Keychains/: /Library/Keychains/System.keychain (0)`. <comment359929> I've been having a similar issue in that my keychain keeps creating popups asking for the password every few hours.  Im not sure if this related but people are discussing it here. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201609. It even got into the NYT: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/technology/personaltech/fixing-a-login-keychain-password-error-in-osx.html. I suspect they don't have the password so they can't switch to the keychain, but they keep trying. <comment359940> @EvanRosica - All I can say is, in my case I'm definitely not getting repeated password requests from the keychain manager. Just those messages in the console log.
