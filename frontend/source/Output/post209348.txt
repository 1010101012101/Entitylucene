Skipped iCloud Keychain configuration during install of El Capitan <body> During installation of El Capitan I skipped the iCloud Keychain configuration because it wouldn't validate the code sent to my phone.  What was this process for and how do I restart it now that the instillation is complete?  <answer209349> Settings  iCloud  Keychain. You should be able to set it up from ther. Make sure your phone is also on iOS 9.  <comment252517> I only have iPhone 4. <comment252518> I see, its a password manager.
