Unable to upgrade iMac to Snow Leopard <body> I am unable to upgrade my iMac to Snow Leopard even though it seems to meet all the requirements. The iMac has:  ul liIntel Core 2 Duo processor/li liDVD drive/li li4GB RAM/li li185GB of storage available./li /ul  When I try to install, it simply says "Mac OS X Snow Leopard cannot be installed on this computer."  <answer59486> I got a different disc and it worked. Apparently, the disc I originally tried was only to be used on the computer it came with.  <comment68478> What version of OSX are you currently using on your iMac (you can find out in ï£¿ - "About My Mac")? Does booting from the Snow Leopard DVD work (reboot with the DVD inserted, hold Alt/Option when the chime sounds)? <comment68480> Are you trying got use a disc that came with a different Mac? <comment68487> OS X 10.5.8. Yes, I am using the disk that came with my MacBook Pro. <comment68517> Yes, the discs that come with a computer are keyed to only work with that specific model, you need to use a retail disc to upgrade another computer.
