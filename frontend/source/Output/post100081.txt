Applying Filtering on NAT'd Packets NetBSD (pf.conf) <body> Is there a way to filter packets after applying NAT?  What I am trying to do:  Apply NAT to packets going to some host, but block packets with a specific port. I have tried a few things but nothing is working for me. Here is what I have in the pf.conf file.  precodebinat pass on en0 from 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.35 -&gt; 192.168.10.2 block drop out on en0 inet proto tcp from 192.168.10.2 port=65123 to 192.168.10.35 /code/pre  If I remove the nat, the packets with port 65123 are blocked, but if the NAT is there, they are not blocked./li
