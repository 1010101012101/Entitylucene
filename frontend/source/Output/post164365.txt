Prevent iTunes 12 for Windows from stopping podcast update <body> There are some podcasts that I listen to infrequently, but when I do, I want to listen to emall/em of the previous episodes. After I stop listening for a while, however, iTunes stops updating automatically. How can I ensure that it always automatically keeps downloading new episodes of these podcasts?  This is the same issue described in the question "Stop iTunes from automatically stopping podcast downloads" for an older version of iTunes. There weren't any good solutions for Windows then. Is there a solution for iTunes 12?  <comment192690> This question is a direct result of the suggestions to my question on Meta, ["If an old question wasn't answered, is there a good way to bump it?"](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2290/if-an-old-question-wasnt-answered-is-there-a-good-way-to-bump-it/2291) <comment193492> I haven't had this problem with the current version -- maybe this "feature" was removed?  Maybe I have it set differently... not sure. <comment312606> No it's still there, even as of now. It's annoying as hell.
