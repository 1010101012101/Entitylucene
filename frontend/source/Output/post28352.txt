How can I bypass Textmate asking for my password every time I save a file? <body> I'm using Lion and every time I edit a file, TextMate prompt me for my password.  Is there a way to bypass that?  <answer28353> Chances are you are trying to save your file somewhere other than under your home directory.  In my experience, Textmate codeSave/code dialogs often default to the system root directory.  If you try to save there, you will get an authentication request as you normally would not have write permission.  Expand the codeSave/code dialog box and choose somewhere in your home directory tree.  <answer30807> Just codechmod -R ug+w project-dir/code (starting from the root of the project)  <comment32572> Hi there. I voted to move this to www.superuser.com since it is more of a general computer question than a programming question. You should get much better answers over there. Cheers! <comment32573> My bad! Thanks for voting to move it. <comment32574> I reworded your question so that it's not the same thing as the question. I added (and assumed) that you're trying to edit system files, if that is not correct, please edit the question to remove that part. <comment32734> I don't think I'm saving in my home directory. I'm saving in "/users/myusername/rails_projects". <comment32742> @WaleyChen `/Users/MyUsername/` is equal to `~` your home directory, everything below it, ie. `rails_projects` should have permissions set to you, if not, you can change it with `chown username filename` <comment32745> Still getting blanks. I used chown and chmoded everything on the file hello.txt "-rwxrwxrwx   1 nikeelevet  staff    3 19 Oct 23:01 hello.txt" but TextMate still opens a blank file. I think this might be a tricky problem ... <comment35217> So you're being prompted for a password every time you try to edit any file in TextMate? Does this happen if you use another program to edit the files (like, for instance, TextEdit)? <comment35378> yeah same thing happens, but this time i got it to work :p, chmod ugo+w * everything in the project, thanks for the push :) <comment35566> This leaves all files world-writable which might be dangerous - isn't `chmod -R u+w` enough? <comment35653> you're right, it's dangerous, seems that I need at least chmod -R ug+w access though to not get textmate to ask for my pw, thanks! <comment35655> "world"-writable, for the world of people who have an account on your machine. Could be dangerous in some contexts, but...
