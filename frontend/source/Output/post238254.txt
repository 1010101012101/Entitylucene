Can't reduce bootcamp partition size in El Capitan <body> I have a 512GB hard disk using the latest macbook pro running El Capitan. When bootcamp partition was created it was allocated 350GB. Now I want to bring that down to 100GB since the windows partition is hardly ever used. Bootcamp is running Windows 10 Pro.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rNhii.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VFF7b.png" alt="enter image description here"  Disk Utility won't let me reduce the bootcamp partition. The slider let's you shrink macs partition but not bootcamps!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fnGu1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Disk Manager from windows 10 looks like the below: (sorry about the compression!):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LegJX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've also tried tool named iPartition but it report "destructive process for the selected changes".  Here's how my partition table looks (note I don't understand the output myself, but hope someone here can help):  precodediskutil list sudo gpt -r -vvv show -l /dev/disk0 sudo fdisk /dev/disk0     gpt show: /dev/disk0: mediasize=500277790720; sectorsize=512; blocks=977105060 gpt show: /dev/disk0: PMBR at sector 0 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Pri GPT at sector 1 gpt show: /dev/disk0: GPT partition: type=C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B, start=40, size=409600 gpt show: /dev/disk0: GPT partition: type=53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC, start=409640, size=291724536 gpt show: /dev/disk0: GPT partition: type=426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC, start=292134176, size=1269536 gpt show: /dev/disk0: GPT partition: type=EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7, start=293404672, size=683700224 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Sec GPT at sector 977105059       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6          40     409600      1  GPT part - "EFI System Partition"      409640  291724536      2  GPT part - "OSX"   292134176    1269536      3  GPT part - "Recovery HD"   293403712        960   293404672  683700224      4  GPT part - "BOOTCAMP"   977104896        131   977105027         32         Sec GPT table   977105059          1         Sec GPT header        /code/pre  strongCan anyone help guide me reducing bootcamp partition?/strong   <comment292107> When you are running Disk Management under Windows, how much can you shrink the Boot Camp partition? At this point, I am not asking you to actually shrink the partition. I just want know how much it can be shrunk. Just to let you know, it would probably be easier to delete the Boot Camp partition and reinstall Windows in a new 100 GB partition. <comment292113> From the menu bar, select "About this Mac". Edit your question and post the  year and screen size of your Mac. Also, which version  of Windows are you running?. <comment292116> @DavidAnderson updated the question <comment292121> You probably will not be able to shrink the Boot Camp partition down to 100 GB. Currently  the smallest is ~185 GB. You might be able to free more space if you defragment the Boot Camp volume. Unless you get the size down to less than 175 GB, it would be difficult to move the Boot Camp partition. You need to move the Boot Camp partition before you can expand the OS X partition  to fill the free space. Another possibility would be to purchase a product to help shrink/move the BootCamp partition. [Winclone](http://twocanoes.com/products/mac/winclone) is such a product.
