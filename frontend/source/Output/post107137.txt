Why does OS X Mavericks freeze while typing comments on StackExchange Pages in Safari? <body> For a couple of days i am using strongOS X Mavericks and Safari/strong for browsing. Sometimes while writing questions or comments on strongStackExchange/strong pages, the computer strongfreezes/strong, and on the screen appear suddenly some black points like pixels. Not just in the section of browser, but also everywhere on screen. Then i must hard shut down the computer, by strongpressing the power button/strong.  This happened to me until now 5-6 times, in 2-3 days. It was always while typing. Maybe it has sth to do with Javascript, i dont know.. Using strongChrome/strong i did strongnot/strong have this problem until now.  ul liThis is my Safari version: Version 7.0 (9537.71)/li liThis is my OS X version: 10.9 Build 13A603/li /ul  Anybody else having this issue?
