Auto adjust screen brightness data <body> I was wondering if there is a way to retrieve the data generated by the brightness sensor of the screen in a MacBook with this auto brigthness capabilities.  Do you know something how can we do something like this?  <answer251072> See Amit Singh's Experimenting With Light On Apple Notebook Computers but note Apple do not provide official support for these methods:     Please note that there are no Apple "APIs" to access the motion sensor or the ambient light sensor.   Amit's code examines the IOKit entry from codeAppleLMUController/code.  Also related to your question is How do you programmatically access the ambient light sensor on Mac OS X 10.5+?
