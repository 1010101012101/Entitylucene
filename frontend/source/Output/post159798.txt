Bootcamp: Insert Boot disk error <body> Ok so I have been trying all day using all sorts of ISO's that I can find but I run through the process in Boot Camp Assistant ensuring that all three options are selected and I point to my ISO but after the system restarts I just get the "No bootable device" error.   I can access my OSX partition by holding alt/option at startup, Windows also appears here but selecting it just results in the same "No bootable device" error.   I have a mid 2011 mac mini (no cd/dvd drive), OSX Yosemite. I had no issue with Mavericks.   All help appreciated...  <comment187793> You also need a USB-thumb drive! <comment187794> Yes, that is what I am trying to boot from (64GB Stick). <comment187797> I want Windows 7 Pro, I tried this first but thought maybe that there was an issue with ISO, so I got my hand on Windows 7 Home and gave that one a try to see it that was the case, it wasn't it seems BootCamp is creating the Boot Disk wrong and it's not readable :/ <comment187798> Original ISOs? Here's a list of valid ISOs: [digitalriver](http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/14-windows-7-direct-download-links) <comment187800> [Windows 7 SP1 Pro x64 en-us](http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59186.iso) <comment187807> Yep, they are the ones that I have tried using :( <comment187808> Please check my answer to a similar question [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/148246/late-2013-macbook-retina-windows-7-x64-bootcamp-no-device-drivers-found/148898#148898) <comment187815> Giving it a try, thanks, I'll let you know how I get on :) <comment187817> Ok so I followed the instructions on that other thread and still no joy, I copied the updated BootCamp Support files to the USB Drive but I still get the same error :/ <comment187820> Please start from scratch. Remove the windows partition with the bootcamp assistant and reformat  your thumb drive (exFAT) with the disk utility. in your case only the steps 1-5 of my answer are important. Additionally you may add the output of the command `diskutil list` executed in Terminal.app in your answer. <comment187824> Ok, I will start from Scratch again, after removing the bootcamp drive should I then use it again to create everything for me? <comment187847> if you own another thumb drive try that one first. <comment187850> I don't own another, although I may leave it till tomorrow and borrow one ... thanks for all your help, I will let you know if/when I get this to work
