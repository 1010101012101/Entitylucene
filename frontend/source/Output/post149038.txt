Adjusting live webcam video saturation, contrast, and brightness in iOS 8 <body> Is there a way to alter the saturation, contrast, and brightness on my camera while I'm in a webcam session in iOS 8?  For example, when I'm Skyping or using Google Chat or Facetime?  <comment175559> did you read this http://iphonephotographyschool.com/ios-8-camera-and-photos/ <comment175566> @Buscar웃 Good read, but I'm looking for something specific to webcams.  My house is a bit too bright, and it makes me look like an evil ghost in front of my girlfriend and workmates. :) <comment175568> Stick a foil over it :)--pick a color! just kidding, is it a external cam or build in? <comment175570> @Buscar웃 It's built in.  Just a normal iPhone 4s.
