How much free space do I need to install Mavericks 10.9.4? <body> I have downloaded OS X Mavericks 10.9.4 which is 283 MB, and I have free space of 168 GB and I am getting an error as shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcSQH.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3Qn4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer219731> You have more than enough space on your disk  I'd very much like to see a picture of your 'About this Mac screen', from the  Apple menu, just to be certain you're heading in the right direction.  It should look something like this…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a1d49.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also, you'd be better off installing the 10.9.5 Combo Update which will install all updates from 10.9.0 to 10.9.5 without needing any intermediate steps.  emAfter comments &amp; posted picture:/embr You cannot jump over an update using just the delta update, only using a combo.   <comment265898> I've added screenshot you asked for <comment265910> I'd try the combo updater I linked above. I'm not sure the delta updater can jump updates 10.9.2 to 10.9.4 without 10.9.3 first. The combo definitely can. <comment265989> yea the combo did, I tried yesterday night and now I am on 10.9.5 <comment266004> Glad you got there :)
