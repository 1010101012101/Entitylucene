Can OneNote display all notes sequentially in one window for quick browsing (like Evernote)? <body> OneNote on OS X displays one note in one section of a notebook at a time. Is there a way I can get it to display all notes in a section in one big vertically scrolling window, like Evernote does?   I don't like having to click on each note in the section to view only that note.  <answer245022> Unfortunately, no.  One Note is setup much like a spiral bound notebook where you can categorize your notes, make note groups, etc.  That's is one of the differntiating features of One Note over Evernote     User interface: OneNote looks and feels like a digital version of a   paper notebook, complete with tags and notebook sections. Evernote is   more like a filing cabinet, with a simpler notes interface yet   powerful tagging capabilities.   Lifehacker - Note-Taking Showdown: Evernote vs. OneNote (2016 Edition)
