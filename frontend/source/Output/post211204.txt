Sublime Text 2 - Save Dialogue Tab Issues <body> I've started using Sublime Text 2 on OS X and its great apart from one small thing.  I've enabled Tab to go through all controls:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w4uVM.png" alt="OS X Keyboard Shortcut Settings"  However, I cannot tab through on this dialogue that pops up when I try and close a window after making changes  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/62RzT.png" alt=""  Is there a fix to this or is this something that I'm going to have to open a thread on the forum?  <answer211209> Chances are high you have the same keybinding active in Sublime.    Sublime Text uses a huge load of hotkeys/combinations and these are all defined in a simple textfile.  Go to "Menu/Sublime Text/Preferences/Key Bindings - Default", search for that combination and comment it out (or assign it to another hotkey).
