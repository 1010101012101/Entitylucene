Keys of a Particular Scale Only in GarageBand on OS X <body> I used to have an iPad and had great time using GarageBand.  The feature that made my time fun is mostly "Scale" i.e. when I choose a particular scale, for instance "D#maj Pentatonic Blues", the instrument suddenly turns into a "virtual" instrument which does not allow you to play a note that is outside of the scale.  It's not that I don't have any knowledge about the music, but that was super fun. You can mess around all you want and you never get a bad note.  Why is this not available in OSX? Isn't this a great feature?   If it is available, where can I find it?  Edit: A keyboard looks like this when you use scale: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6hUea.jpg" alt="this"  Edit 2: I forgot to mention. I have a MacBook Pro right now. That is the reason I ask this question.  <comment241271> GarageBand is available for $4.99 in the Apple App Store. <comment241308> i have the app.
