Command Line: create a link to folder and access files in this folder <body> I want to do this thing:   ul liCreate a link to a folder./li liPut this link in home (~) directory/li liAccess files in linked folder from home directory (~/LinkToFolder/file)/li /ul  What is the best way to it?  Main Problem. I have a set of scripts, that lay in specific folder in git repository local clone. I want to access them from home directory in very simple way.  codeperl ~/LinkToFolder/myWorkScript.pl param1 param2/code  <answer115147> You can do this with strongSymlinks/strong:  precodeln -s /path/to/original/location /path/to/intended/shortcut /code/pre  For example, if you want ~/Scripts to go to ~/Dropbox/Documents/Scripts you can do…  precodeln -s ~/Dropbox/Documents/Scripts ~/Scripts /code/pre  Then codeopen ~/Scripts/test.sh/code will open the file at code~/Dropbox/Documents/Scripts/test.sh/code.  To see the symlink you can run codels -laPGh ~/Scripts/code.  For example, I have my Mobile Documents folder symlinked as iCloud, so…  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codels -lapGh ~/iCloud lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 grgarside  staff    41B 12 Nov  2012 iCloud -&gt; /Users/grgarside/Library/Mobile Documents /code/pre  <comment134780> good answer, but I want to add, that I must put absolute path as original location :) Please, add this information to answer <comment134781> @gaussblurinc It should work also with relative paths and with ~ (it will be expanded by the shell). Which problem did you have? <comment134782> @Matteo I go to my directory and make `ln -s Scripts/ ~/Scripts`. This thing won't work for me, it seems, that symlink doesn't point on original :( <comment134804> @gaussblurinc:  `ln -s THE_File_or_DIR_POINTED_AT  The_NEW_SYMLINK`. So `ln -s /path/to/Scripts  ~/Scripts` will create in your homedir a "Scripts" symlink pointing at `/path/to/Scripts` . Do not use "~" elsewhere (ie, in the first parameter, for example) as it's only useable in some conditions, but not always. "~" is only evaluated to your homedir in special (common) cases, but not always. <comment134805> @gaussblurinc : not also that `ls -al /the/symlink` will list the symlink itself.  `ls -al /the/symlink/` [note the trailing `/`] will list the content of the directory pointed at. Ie, beware of some special side-effects of using a symlink.
