characters stick at the beginning of CLI <body> When I press arrow up to search through the command history, some characters always remain at the beginning of the command line. Does anyone know what's going on ? How can I fix it?  for example, I ping google.com, it looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WLv0q.png" alt="enter image description here"  then I press up arrow a few times and down arrow a few times, some characters stick at the beginning of the command line like this:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uoCuY.png" alt="enter image description here"  those characters can't be removed or highlight, and I can still use the CLI normally, like this:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dzfmY.png" alt="enter image description here" and move between directory despite the leading characters: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvu8S.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer142656> Your Bash prompt is not properly escaped for non-printing characters, so it thinks the prompt is longer than it truly is (and doesn't delete some of the characters). To fix it, add code\[/code and code\]/code around the invisible parts.  You need to change it to:  precodeexport PS1='\[\e[31m\]\W\[\e[0m\] ' /code/pre
