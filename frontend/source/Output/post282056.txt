Sync specific photo album between devices <body> I don't want to sync all all my iPhone photos on my MacBook because it's going to use too much space.  However, I do want to sync specific albums. Let's say I'd want to sync codeFavorites/code and codeTest/code.  How can I do that?  hr  I didn't sync my iPhone with my mac for a long time because I'm afraid some of the photos will be deleted either from my iPhone or from my MacBook.  <comment355093> What versions of macOS, iTunes and iOS are you running? <comment355095> @Monomeeth `macOS Sierra 10.12.3` and `iOS 10.2.1`.
