Get Keychain to remember an additional field <body> I regularly log on to a financial website using Google Chrome  This requires me to enter a codeAccount/code number, a codepassword/code and also an codeEmployer/code number. I store the codeAccount/code and codepassword/code in my Keychain, but have to enter the 8 digit codeEmployer/code number each time.  Is there any way of getting Keychain to remember this additional number.  <answer170710> That is not possible.  But you can use Chrome to remember your Account number, while the keychain can contain the Password + Employer information.  However, some website (specialty finical) do not offer to save log in credentials for security reason.  <answer170737> There's no way to force Keychain to store the additional field.  I use 1Password for things that Safari/Keychain refuse to remember.br You can manually add fields for sites such as banks [at your own risk] where credentials will not auto-save.  There's also LastPass, but I haven't tried that  <comment200946> Thanks. I have looked at 1Password in the past, but will give a try again.
