Commandline tools not installed with Server.app on Mavericks <body> I installed the Server.app from the App Store to use the bundeled postgres DB:  precodesudo serveradmin start postgres /code/pre  Then I found out, that the commandline tool "serveradmin" (and others) have not been installed as implied by other postings.  Was this a change by Apple, or did I miss something?  <answer138963> I found the path. The path to the server tools is:  precode/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin/serveradmin /code/pre  I think I was too impatient and did not wait for codelocate.updatedb/code to complete.  <comment163936> Commandline tools should be installed by default on OS X server. You can always install them manually by running `xcode-select --install` in the Terminal.
