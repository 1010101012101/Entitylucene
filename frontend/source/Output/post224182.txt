OS X give focus to a window after showing <body> I have noticed something that really annoys me. Say I have some applications running and then I select a particular one using Dock. This application appears on the screen but does not receive focus (windows is displayed as inactive). So, when I type something input is not going to the foremost window.  For more clarification I can say that I always encounter this when focusing Terminal app that is not maximized - window is shown, but no focus on it. Moreover, when I click on an app icon in the Dock and this app was maximized, I have to click twice to see this app.  Have anyone encountered the same?  strongUPD/strong: the problem relates to switching from full-screen app to non full-screen and vice versa. Switching from one full screen app to another full screen app or from one non-full screen to another non-full screen does not reproduce the problem  <answer224185> I would also take a look at bettertouchtool although january 2016 is the last month it will be freeware. I believe it has an option for it  <answer225870> Found solution myself. In system settings on the Mission Control tab the second option of the top group must be checked. I don't know exactly how it is in English, it shall be something like 'Switch to space with application windows when switching to an application' or something like that.  I used this as a tip, it says about the third checkbox, but in my case the second one has solved my trouble.  <comment271850> It's something I've noticed occasionally happens - used to be more so on Mavericks. Try killing the Dock `killall -KILL Dock` & check again. <comment271910> It seems that it didn't help. <comment271911> I'm not sure that I need to use external app for the behavior that should be build-in. <comment271912> True that, however it was a thought that came up. Delete this answer if u see fit <comment271913> Does rebooting restore the correct behaviour? <comment271953> It seems that not :( <comment271966> Then I'd check it in the guest account or make a new admin account & test there. <comment272669> @Tetsujin I've created a new admin account, it worked fine there. After I switched back to my account it also worked fine for some time. Later, problem came  back <comment272747> That leaves the likelihood that it's something running on one account only. The difficult bit is going to be... figuring out what. <comment274166> @Tetsujin I've tested in safe mode, problem is still there. It seems that it is not caused by an application that starts at system startup. <comment274176> Finally I've solved this! <comment274209> It reads "When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application." You should update your question to make it clear that this has to do only with apps/windows in different spaces. <comment274448> I do not agree. I do not use spaces at all, so my problem is not related to them, but ticking this checkbox solved it.
