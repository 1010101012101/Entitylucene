Upgrade to Mavericks from an external HDD <body> I have Snow Leopard on and external HDD. Is it possible to boot form the external drive, and install Mavericks on the internal drive via the Mac App Store?  <answer121849> Yes this is entirely possible. Download Mavericks from the Mac App Store and in the install process select your internal disk as the destination for the install.
