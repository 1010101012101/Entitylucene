macOS 10.13 High Sierra - Location Services will not enable <body> I'm running macOS 10.13 High Sierra on my 2011 15" MacBook Pro. Whenever I try to enable Location Services, the checkbox momentarily turns 'checked' and then goes back to disabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FATjp.jpg" alt="System Preferences - Security &amp; Privacy"  How can I enable Location Services on this Mac? Is it not an option because the Bluetooth is limited to v2.1?
