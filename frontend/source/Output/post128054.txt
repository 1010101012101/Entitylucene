Unknown contacts appeared out of thin air <body> My contact list op my iPhone 5s suddenly shows hundreds of contacts for people that I do not know with full contact info. I have synced with Facebook and have LinkedIn and Exchange installed, but these contacts are not part of my "friends". Has anyone experienced the same issue? What can I do?  <answer128167> There are many possibility:  1: Facebook sync with your contact info, as I know, Facebook will suggest people you may know to you.  2: Are you using a same Apple ID with your families or friends? Contacts will sync to your other device with same Apple ID.  3: Are you using other's SIM card? SIM card store contact inside the micro chip!!  4: Your Apple ID have been hacked.....change your password immediately and never tell others your ID and password.  <answer160166> You need to deselct contacts under the facebook app in settings, then select 'dont allow changes' under settings and restrictions.  <answer174531> Turns out, that Outlook had synchronized thousands of contacts from MS CRM. Deleting them from Outlook solved the problem.  <comment150036> Look if any of your accounts are hacked, by changing the passwords on them. <comment150048> Do they show up in your [iCloud Contacts](https://www.icloud.com/#contacts)?
