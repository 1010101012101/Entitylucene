WhatsApp doesn't use contact name on lock screen notifications <body> Hello Community Members,  I am using iOS device (iPhone) with latest iOS version.  I am facing an unusual problem with WhatsApp.   When I get message from one of my contacts and screen is locked, WhatsApp shows that I got message from name (name it uses is set by user, and not as saved in my contacts)  Example: If I get a message from my brother, whose contact is saved on my device as "Bro" and if screen is locked, it reads 1 message from Mr. Mehta (which is set by my brother as his display name on WhatsApp)  Anyone facing same issue, or it's just me. If yes, any solution for same.  <answer157548> On iOS devices that is the default setting for whatsapp you cannot change it :-/
