Entering Unicode Characters with `ssh ... tmux -CC a -t mySession` on iTerm2 <body> When I ssh into the server and then open tmux, I'm able to enter in Unicode characters. It seems that the problem is specifically with sshing directly with codetmux -CC a -t mySession/code.  Edit: I'm trying to enter unicode characters from my keyboard into text files on my EC2 Ubuntu server with iTerm2 on my macbook using tmux. When I ssh directly into the server and attach to a tmux session, I'm able to enter in unicode characters. If, however, I ssh into tmux directly with the command codessh -i my.pem ubuntu@ec2_domain.com -t 'tmux -CC a -t mySession'/code, I'm unable to enter Unicode characters.  <answer296022> Confirmed fixed w/ Iterm2 3.0.15 and tmux 2.5+ https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/4664  <comment358897> Did you try to use the `-t` switch to `ssh`? <comment358900> @Jakuje Didn't work. <comment358914> Could you be a bit more specific about exactly what you are doing and what you want to achieve.
