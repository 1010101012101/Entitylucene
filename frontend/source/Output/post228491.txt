Outlook for Mac notifications <body> I'm used to Outlook on Windows where if a meeting reminder jumps in I can close the reminders window (clicking the x) and the reminders window will jump in again in a few min (great). Far easier than finding the little snooze arrow.  In Mac closing the window will cause the reminder window to never pop up again on existing reminders unless there is a new reminder. This made me loose some meetings recently. Is there a way to force a Windows like behavior here?  <comment278658> Which version of Outlook are you using? <comment278885> I'm using outlook for mac 14.5.9
