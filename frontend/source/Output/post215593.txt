Ghost contacts in spotlight <body> I have a strange situation, where I see multiple versions of a single contact. When I search for a name I see  ul licurrent version (from iCloud)/li liold version (don't know from where)/li lian even older version (don't know from where)/li /ul  When I try to open the new one, contacts.app start and I see the correct contact. When I try the old one, the app starts but no contact is shown.  I tried clearing spotlight data (block my drive and then unblock it). The contacts first were absent, but soon they reappeared. I guess somewhere on my drive there is a data file which stores the old contacts, but the contacts.app can't access it.  How can I find this file and remove it? It especially annoying in photos which (as it turns out) allow me to tag a photos with three faces and when I search for a name also all three show in the list.  <answer215601> Ok, I've found a dirty solution: I've turned off iCloud contacts, so my Mac had only local "ghost" contacts. Then I've deleted everything in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/sources  I've got no idea what the sources were or why Contacts.app hadn't indexed it (or why Spotlight did), but after turning iCloud contacts back on the only contact version present were the current ones.  The ones from Photos.app however, still are wrong.  <comment260434> If you select the contact, what happens in the contact app to show you the information? Is it in the notes field of another contact or is it a legitimate contact? Can you then delete it? I would also export the correct contact to the desktop and then delete the good contact. At some point you should clean...
