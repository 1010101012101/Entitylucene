Play folder with right button with VLC <body> as a "switcher" I have discovered one functionally that I like in Windows and I don't see in Mac. I want to play all the media files in a folder with VLC with the right click and "Play all" but in this case I need to first open VLC, then click in "Open" and then browse through the folders to finally play the files. Is there any way to play a entire folder with only the right button?  Thanks in advance, best regards.  <answer144324> It doesn't appear possible to do something like codeVLC folder/ folder2//code from the command line. Instead I've successfully created an Automator service that generates a playlist and launches the application passing the list to it.   Here is the service... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cl0uN.png" alt="VLC Service"  To include subfolders enable the option codeRepeat for each subfolder found/code in the first action shown above.  To save you the typing, the shell script code is as follows,  precode# Create playlist PLSFILE=/tmp/VLC_`date +%s`_$$.m3u cat &gt; $PLSFILE  # If file empty just exit [ -s $PLSFILE ] || exit 0  # Launch VLC with our new playlist open -a /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC $PLSFILE --args --playlist-autostart /code/pre  The shell script will do nothing if Finder doesn't find any media files. If VLC is already playing, it will add the files to is existing list. Check the VLC documentation for more information on available options.  Finally you can launch it by right clicking on a folder and then select Services...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NcOMJ.png" alt="VLC Service Launch"  Hope that helped.  <comment169800> What happens if you select a few files in the Finder, then right click on them and select Open? Does it open VLC and add them to the playlist? <comment169801> And you do mean Play a FOLDER no a play file ? <comment301216> Solution works a charm, thanks! I was confused for a bit when my folders kept opening to a track other than the first one. It turns out I had accidentally left VLC set to play tracks in random order.
