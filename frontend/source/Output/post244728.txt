Superuser su password reset <body> I am using OSX 10.6 I am the admin of my computer, however when I try to login as the super user through my terminal using my admin password, I am denied. Is there anyway to reset the password or find out what my password is?  <answer244730> I assume you want to recover the root password. You can reset the password by logging in using your normal administrator account, opening the Terminal and issuing the command codesudo passwd/code.  <answer244736> OS X doesn't set a root password by default, so it's not possible to log in or codesu/code to root. The preferred way to run commands as root is codesudo/code, since that requires your admin password instead of the (nonexistent) root password.  codesudo/code works a little different from codesu/code, as it's really intended to run single commands as root. Generally, you just use codesudo/code as a prefix on whatever command you want to run as root (e.g. codesudo cp -R myApplication.app /Applications/code). If you want a root shell (as codesu/code does by default), use codesudo -s/code.  I don't recommend setting a root password, but if you do need to do it, you can either run codesudo passwd/code or run Directory Utility.app (which is hidden in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications), clicking the padlock and authenticating as an admin, then choosing Edit menu  Enable Root User.   <comment301641> Do you mean the root password not your user password? <comment301655> Thank you, sudo -s was what I was looking for
