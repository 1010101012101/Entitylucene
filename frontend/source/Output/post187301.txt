Using Outlook/Office for Mac 2011 - internal emails sometimes show up with partial code as part of bodytext in Outlook client <body> Emails do not show this code when viewing in Exchange OWA (any os/browser), or Outlook 2010 on Windows.  This is happening to 2 out of the 3 users I have running Office for Mac 2011. Hopefully I have this in the right area, apologies if not.  So far this has been seen (noticed) on internal emails only, but I wouldn't rule out external yet. Source emails that have this issue have come from both Outlook for Mac 2011, and Outlook 2010.  Example of what shows up in Outlook 2011 For Mac:  precode&amp;sthey will all be the same? /html&gt; l&gt;  /code/pre  When I load the user's profile on Exchange OWA the partial code is not there. Looks like the email source code on Outlook has the extra characters, but not when i look at the source in OWA  Running Exchange 2007 SP1, just ensured that all updates were applied to Outlook/Office 2011 and tried searching around Google but I'm at a loss now.  I can't even seem to find anyone that's also suffered from the same issue.
