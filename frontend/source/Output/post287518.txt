Installing Mac OS X 10.3/10.4 from USB <body> I have a PowerMac G4 (AGP) with a working copy of Mac OS 9.2, and a corrupted copy of OS X 10.3. I would like to either reinstall Panther, or upgrade to Tiger. The catch is that for several reasons I am unable to use the CD drive to perform this installation, and am thusly relegated to using USB (I have no FireWire drives or other PPC Macs with which to perform a Target Mode install.). So my question is: how would one make a bootable Mac OS X 10.3/10.4 USB install disk(s) using self-made rips of the CDs?   In the past I have successfully installed Mac OS 9.2 via USB on this machine, however 10.3 always begins the boot process, only to hang on the "Still waiting for root" screen (White background, grey prohibitive logo), and 10.4 always gets as far as the Apple boot logo, only to hang there and stop accessing the USB drive all together.   Any help is appreciated, but please skip the generic "Are you sure it's a genuine CD?" and "Try resetting the PRAM/NVRAM/SMC". Yes I am sure they're genuine, and I have already tried that. I am almost certain the problem is with the way I am making the installer (ripping ISO via Disk Utility, and burning to USB via dcfldd or dd).  <comment363054> Not going to ask any of the *generic* questions :) But it _may_ be useful for context to understand why you are _unable to use the CD drive to perform this installation_? Also, booting from USB is problematic on this model, so I  have the following questions: (1) What USB drives have you tried (include brand/model)? (2) How have you formatted the USB drives? (3) Do you have access to both Panther and Tiger installation discs? (4) Does the Startup Disc Manager itself work (i.e. holding `option` down during startup)?(5) What Boot ROM version is installed? <comment363082> @Monomeeth I can't use the Panther install discs because they refuse to boot (even though I can read/rip them fine once in-OS), and my copy of Tiger is a DVD (the Mac has a CD-R drive, so I can't even read it, I had to rip the image using my iMac). (1) I have tried a 4GB Dane-Elec USB 2.0 disk, which I used to install Linux on my G3 no problem. (2) The disk was formatted with Apple Partition Map and JHFS+/HFS+. (3) I do indeed. (4) Yes, it works fine, and boots other systems via USB no-prob, as does the `boot` command in Open Firmware. (5) Version `4.2.8f1`
