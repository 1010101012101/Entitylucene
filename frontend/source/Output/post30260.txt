Wrong Apple ID for iCloud? <body> My initial Apple ID was associated with a now defunct email address. I just updated my AppleID to a real email. I have managed to update it successfully with everything except iCloud on my phone. The App Store, iTunes, everything else on my phone has the correct ID except iCloud. How do I fix this?  <answer30261> Settings - iCloud (right beneath General). Then scroll down til you see the "Delete Account" button. Should be straight-forward from there.  <comment34734> Thank you! That was easy! I was afraid that the delete account button would affect more than just iCloud. Thanks! <comment110355> Anything else we can do to answer your question? Did it resolve itself?
