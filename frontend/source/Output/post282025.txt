Mapping Windows key on PC keyboard to Expose <body> I'm using a PC keyboard[1] with my Macbook[2], and would like to bind the Windows key to Expose.  Karabiner doesn't seem to offer this out of the box. What's the best way to accomplish this?  [1] HP Wireless Elite V2  [2] MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015), OS X El Capitan (version 10.11.6)  strongEdited/strong: more information about keyboard and MacBook  <comment355061> Welcome to Ask Different. Unfortunately, your question doesn't provide enough detail for us to help you. Can you please edit your question to include what version of macOS you're running? Also, it may be useful to know what type of PC keyboard you have (i.e. what keyboard layout it is)? <comment355068> Thanks, added more info. <comment355084> Thanks for the extra detail. Upon re-reading your question title, I see you're actually wanting to map the Windows key. The problem with this approach is that the Windows key is recognised by macOS as the Command key. With this in mind, have you mapped something else to the Command key? As a minimum you'd have to do that first before mapping the Windows key to something else. However, in all honesty, I would __not__ recommend this approach. Is there a reason you don't want to map another key to Expose? I really would leave the Windows key so that it behaves in the default manner. <comment355097> In GNOME the Windows key does the GNOME equivalent of Expose. I'm also not sure how to bring up Expose w/out trackpad (I'm looking to leave the MacBook in clamshell mode), but I can figure that out, I'm sure.
