zsh stopped parsing ~/.zshrc <body> I'm running the latest OSX on an MBP from '11.  I've installed the latest zsh from macports and all of a sudden it stopped parsing the .zsh. Whenever I login I need to codesource ~/.zshrc/code before any binaries installed through macports are available.  Has anyone seen the same?  <answer121333> This was caused by RVM. I uninstalled RVM and the problem disappeared.  <comment141356> How are you running zsh - if Terminal what command does it run? <comment141358> Not sure if I understand your question. zsh is my login shell so .zshrc should be run whenever I open Terminal.
