Accessing other mac on local network with computer name <body> We have two macs which is connected to a WiFi network. One mac is named 'mobi4' and other mac is named 'mobi6'. In Finder window, I choose Go - Connect To Server and type mobi6, but I get an error "There was a problem connecting to the server "mobi6". However, in File sharing options, it is given that "Other users can access shared folders on this computer, and administrators all volumes, at afp://xxx.xxx.2.106/ or “mobi6”". I tried "mobi6.local" as well in the Connect To Server dialog box.  How to connect to the other mac which just the computer name?  <comment80379> Do you have the Firewall running on mobi6? Can you run iTunes or iPhoto on both machines and them see each others' libraries? <comment80460> Oh, I am not sure. I will test it and say. <comment80501> Have you tried `afp://mobi6.local`? Also, do they appear in the Finder sidebar in the Shared section? (You may need to show 'Connected Servers' in Finder Preferences - Sidebar tab - check Connected Servers box in the Shared section) <comment80543> yup, I tried afp://mobi6.local. However, I get the same error. Ya, If I connect by typing the IP, I see the mobi6 in my sidebar. As @JBRWilkinson said I will try to see if I can see mobi6 iTunes libraries in my mac <comment80544> @JBRWilkinson nope, firewall is turned off in both machines and I am still not able to connect. Also, I can't see mobi6 libraries in my iTunes. <comment81347> @binarybob Suddenly what you said started working. I mean one week back, it didn't matter if I entered afp://mobi6.local or not, I had to enter IP address and access. But this week it started working. Completely dumbfounded by this behavior.
