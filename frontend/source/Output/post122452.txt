Force User logout <body> I've setup my macs to logout the user after 60 minutes of inactivity, but there are many, many times that this doesn't occur.  mail hangs.  some save dialog box was left open, who knows.  Is there a way to force a logout to occur?  <answer122462> You can use a third party program like Power Manager to automatically log out users after inactivity.  The log out process performed by Power Manager is more robust than the built-in method; applications are quit prior to logging out and those applications blocking the process are force quit after an appropriate additional delay.  Within strongPower Manager.app/strong:  ul liClick strongAdd…/strong to create a new event;/li liSelect the strongUser event after inactivity/strong Schedule Assistant task;/li liSelect strongLog Out/strong for strongWhat should be performed?/strong;/li liFollow the remaining steps to create your event./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtJb1.jpg" alt="Power Manager - log out after inactivity"  Disclosure: I work for DssW, the makers of Power Manager.  <answer122463> You could try executing the following Applescript:  precodetell application "loginwindow" to «event aevtrlgo» /code/pre  which forces logout without prompt (aevtrlgo = "Apple Event really go"). This could for example be triggered by applications like SleepWatcher.  <comment143144> This looks nice, i'm going to give it a try.  Thanks for the tip!
