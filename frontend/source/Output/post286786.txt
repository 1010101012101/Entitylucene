Faster way to expand submenus using keyboard <body> Consider the nested menus structure (from Intellij) as shown in the screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F6vig.png" alt="enter image description here"  Using the coderight arrow/code key will cause the codeFind/code submenu to expand. But the right arrow key is inconvenient/slow to reach.    In Linux/Windows the Menu actually opens automatically: is there some faster key combination  - than the awkward code^F2-&lt;E&gt;-&lt;F&gt;-&lt;Right Arrow Key&gt;/code way to nudge OS/X to "move along" a bit faster?  Note: Intellij has strongemover 150 menu items/em/strong so comments/answers like "Why not use Hotkeys?" are naive/impractical.  <answer286790> Why don't you use hotkeys from that menu? code⌘F/code, code⌘R/code etc.  Use codeControl + ]/code  <comment361949> How many `hotkeys` do you want me to remember?? There are ***14 top level menu items*** in Intellij - each of which has between ***15 to 25 subentries*** - some of which are actually submenus ..  so maybe .. ***200 or so menu items ?***   And some of them change from one version of Intellij to the next. This is *not* like `command-c` for copy  - which I *do* use: there are only maybe 15 of those kinds of standard editing shortcuts to remember. <comment361951> I don't think it's possible. I think it's done this way, because you can type the name of the command using the keyboard, and by pressing the `→` you also move "the keyboard focus" to the submenu. P.S. it's just my guess.. <comment361959> Use control + ] <comment361960> `control-]` works!  How did you discover it?  Are there other similar "tricks"? <comment361961> I just tried all combinations with control ;-)
