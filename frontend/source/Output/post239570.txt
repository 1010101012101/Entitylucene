Local LAN network does not connect after turning off wireless in Yosemite 10.10.5 <body> The title says it: if I disconnect my Wifi the network does not come up on the cable LAN, unless if I reboot the system.  Any fix for this, or workaround?  strongUpdate 1/strong: I get this data on my local LAN adapter when I ran codeifconfig/code:   precodeen1: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt; ether XX:YY:ZZ:AA:BB:DD  media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt; status: inactive /code/pre  I have tried, after disabling my wireless (en0), the following sequence of commands, but nothing happens:  precode sudo ifconfig en1 down  sudo ifconfig en1 up /code/pre  strongUpdate 2/strong: the result of codesystem_profiler SPNetworkDataType | pbcopy/code is  precodeNetwork:  Bluetooth DUN:    Type: PPP (PPPSerial)   Hardware: Modem   BSD Device Name: Bluetooth-Modem   IPv4:       Configuration Method: PPP   IPv6:       Configuration Method: Automatic   Proxies:       FTP Passive Mode: Yes   Service Order: 0  Wi-Fi:    Type: AirPort   Hardware: AirPort   BSD Device Name: en0   IPv4:       Configuration Method: DHCP   IPv6:       Configuration Method: Automatic   Ethernet:       MAC Address: 5c:30:0a:be:d9:93       Media Options:        Media Subtype: Auto Select   Proxies:       Exceptions List: *.local, 169.254/16       FTP Passive Mode: Yes   Service Order: 1  TomTom START 50:    Type: Ethernet   Hardware: Ethernet   BSD Device Name: en4   IPv4:       Configuration Method: DHCP   IPv6:       Configuration Method: Automatic   Proxies:       Exceptions List: *.local, 169.254/16       FTP Passive Mode: Yes   Service Order: 2  Thunderbolt Ethernet:    Type: Ethernet   Hardware: Ethernet   BSD Device Name: en5   IPv4:       Configuration Method: DHCP   IPv6:       Configuration Method: Automatic   Proxies:       Exceptions List: *.local, 169.254/16       FTP Passive Mode: Yes   Service Order: 3  Bluetooth PAN:    Type: Ethernet   Hardware: Ethernet   BSD Device Name: en3   IPv4:       Configuration Method: DHCP   IPv6:       Configuration Method: Automatic   Proxies:       Exceptions List: *.local, 169.254/16       FTP Passive Mode: Yes   Service Order: 4  Thunderbolt Bridge:    Type: Ethernet   Hardware: Ethernet   BSD Device Name: bridge0   IPv4:       Configuration Method: DHCP   IPv6:       Configuration Method: Automatic   Proxies:       Exceptions List: *.local, 169.254/16       FTP Passive Mode: Yes   Service Order: 5  XPTO VPN:    Type: PPP (L2TP)   IPv4:       Configuration Method: PPP       OverridePrimary: 1   IPv6:       Configuration Method: Automatic   Proxies:       FTP Passive Mode: Yes   Service Order: 6 /code/pre  <comment294029> Can you clarify?  What do you mean by "not come up"  Is the adapter "turned off" or is it just not getting a DHCP lease? <comment294037> It means that I the LAN adapter is active, but after turning off wifi, the computer does not connect automatically to the local LAN (and from there to the Internet). However, if I reboot, with the wifi turned off, then the computer connects to the local LAN when it comes up. <comment294039> So, you have two network connections to the same network active at the same time?  (That's not advisable as you will have two gateways on one machine) .  Have you tried renewing the IP Lease?  What about turning off the adapter and turning it back on? <comment294042> No, my wifi network is different from my local LAN network. If I go to preferences, it says that the cable is disconnected, but it isn't. Only if I reboot, than I have local cable network. <comment294043> `en1` is typically your wireless.  `en0` is your Ethernet.  Try `ifconfig en0`.  Or, better yet, go to System Preferences  Network and under "Configure IPv4" dropdown, select "Off", then press "Apply."  Then turn it back on. <comment294052> Can you issue the command:  `system_profiler SPNetworkDataType | pbcopy`.  Nothing will come back, but just go to your question and paste the results - `pbcopy` sends the output to your clipboard. <comment294399> @Allan I have updated the question with the output of such command. Does it help? (I still have the problem). <comment294400> @mljrg Please add the manufacturer and the model of the LAN adapter! <comment294402> Did you issue that command before or after you did you `ifconfig en0 down`.  The only Ethernet I am seeing there is `en5` <comment294415> @Allan I issued the command with the wifi turned off. <comment294417> @klanomath the manufacter is Apple, the model is ThunderboltIP
