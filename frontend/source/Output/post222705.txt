How to ensure that windows opened from the Dock open in the current Space/Desktop <body> A Mail window was in the Dock, and I clicked on it to restore it to my current Desktop.  Instead of opening where I can see it, it went to some other Desktop, presumably the one it was in when it was minimized.   I use different Desktops for different projects, where one Desktop may have multiple browser windows, multiple text editors, etc., so I've disabled the default setting of "When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application", because that seems to only make sense if you use an approach of one Space per Application, which makes no sense for me.  As far as I can tell this is the only setting I'm using that may be relevant to this problem, but I really really don't want to have OS X forcing me to constantly switch spaces and force me into a one-space-per-app model.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dygTJ.png" alt="Mission Control settings"  Is there some way to make the window I restore (de-minimize) appear in emmy current Space/Desktop/em?  It could be  ul lia hidden preference that I set with codedefaults write/code;/li lian AppleScript that I have to trigger after restoring the window, to move it to my current Space/Desktop;/li lisome utility application meant to handle this problem/li lisome other workaround or solution I hadn't thought of./li /ul  (An AppleScript would probably be the least desirable approach, but it could be triggered with Alfred, QuicKeys, or BetterTouchTool, etc.)  It might also be worth mentioning that I'm using Yosemite because of problems between El Capitan and TotalSpaces2, but I'd like to know if upgrading solves this problem.  <answer228021> Possibly this helps your situation:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO /code/pre  <answer246164> kbdâŒ˜ Command/kbd "click" on the minimized window in the dock, and it will restore (de-minimize) in the current workspace, regardless of which space it was on when it was minimized.  <comment278092> will this make it open in my current space, or just avoid switching spaces when it is restored? <comment278156> somehow yes. It does not auto change to the space the window is opened again, which helps staying in context. you then can use the context menu in the dock to bring the window to this space. <comment278166> Unfortunately it has a side effect.  Now if I (e.g.) select a window from the Window menu, I do not switch to the space of that window. <comment303454> doesn't work if "Minimize windows into application icon" setting is enabled, but still upvoting this one. <comment303875> Is there any way to make this the default?  I'd rather use `command` to put the window into "the background" (i.e. another space), much like command-clicking on a link puts the link into a background tab in a browser.
