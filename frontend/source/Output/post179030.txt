iBooks for Mac: Duplicate Storage <body> I have recently purchased and downloaded an ePub book from a website, and safely kept it on my code~/Books/code folder. To read it, I used Add to Library from iBooks for Mac. I noticed that it then copied the whole book (630MB) to code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books//code.  Is there a way I can prevent it from doing so?  <comment212143> This site works better if you stick to the "one question per question" rule. Feel free to ask a second question for the part I've removed.
