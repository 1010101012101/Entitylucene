Delete old "Faces" and other data and thumbnails in iPhoto 9.5.1 <body> I split my iPhoto Library into two by:  ol liDuplicating it/li liDeleting most old photos from the strongnew/strong one I will continue to use (and emptying the iPhoto trash)/li liDeleting the photos from the strongarchived/strong one that will stay in the new library/li /ol  The issue is that currently, the strongnew/strong library still contains "Faces" and other thumbnail data from photos that have already been deleted (but preserved in the separate strongarchived/strong one).  These are contained in the codeData/code, codeData.noindex/code, codeOriginals/code, codeThubmnails/code, codeMasters/code, codeModified/code, and other directories.  I rebuilt the library with all four methods in iPhoto 9.5.1 following Apple's instructions, but to no avail.  How can I free this new library of legacy files?  <answer117733> Although it seems tedious, it may be better to export all your photos out of a library and then create a new iPhoto Library and then import them to the new one. I'm also yet to discover a way to 'purge' data that is no longer relevant/needed.  <comment137775> The issue with this is that edits, events, albums, etc. are not preserved.
