Apple TextEdit - where is the file being saved? <body> I used to use Save As… to remember the directory I was saving a file in, but that seems to have disappeared with the latest OS.  I have a file open in TextEdit. How does one go about finding the directory that this file is currently being saved to? I can see the name and I can "open recent" (which just displays the name), but, once open, I can't actually figure out how to determine where this file is located.  <answer53040> Try pressing kbdCommand/kbdkbd⌘/kbd while you left-click on the document window title text. It will show the folder hierarchy in a pop-up menu.  <comment60657> Hey, I didn't know this! I though this only worked for the Finder.
