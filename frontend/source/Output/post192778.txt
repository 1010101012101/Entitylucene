IDE for R in OSX? <body> I am trying to find some editor/IDE for R in OSX.  I am using currently TextMate but not probably the good choice.  How can you type R in some good editor/IDE?   <answer192782> You can easily install coderstudio/code by typing the following:  precodebrew cask install rstudio /code/pre  To be able to install it, you need homebrew installed and homebrew cask.  To install codehomebrew/code type:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  To enable codehomebrew cask/code type:  precodebrew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask /code/pre  <comment229568> There's also a [RStudio disk image installer](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
