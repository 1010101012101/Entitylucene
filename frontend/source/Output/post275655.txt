How can I prevent my bluetooth headset from preempting the internal mic on connection? <body> How can I prevent my bluetooth headset from preempting the internal mic on connection?  Every time I connect my headset I am forced to go into sound preferences to set the mic back to the internal microphone.  macOS Sierra 10.12.3  <answer275683> You must go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Bluetooth/code, select the headset device and click the codeX/code on the right side to remove it. When you need to use the headset again, it will need re-pairing. (Screenshot below shows my Apple Trackpad, for which new batteries are imminently needed!)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3vlO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment346951> My problem is arising when I make a connection. I want to be able to use them as the output and not the input. <comment346964> I'm not sure you can separate the two functions in Bluetooth. I do not have such a device, so I cannot test myself. Sorry.
