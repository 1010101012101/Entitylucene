Is it possible to migrate keyboard shortcuts for all my applications via an export? <body> I have a bunch of keyboard shortcuts setup for Pages, Keynote, and several other programs. Is there a way to export and then import these shortcuts? I just reformatted my home computer and am now going through the painful process of re-creating all the shortcuts.   Paul Irish's dotfiles got me thinking about this: https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles  <answer66791> It depends on how you have defined the shortcut keys. The files responsible for storing these preferences are in the usual place: ~/Library/Preferences  You could simply move the files that store the preferences over to the new Mac:  ul licom.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/li licom.apple.universalaccess.plist/li licom.apple.iWork.Keynote.plist/li licom.apple.iWork.Pages.plist/li /ul  If you were good at parsing JSON or XML, you could do the export to a text file as well using the codeplutil/code tool.  <answer66849> The shortcuts for sandboxed applications are stored in code~/Library/Containers/*/Data/Library/Preferences/*.plist/code. The shortcuts for all applications are in code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code. You could probably just copy the preference files from the old account.  I use a shell script like this to configure the shortcuts in the old-style property list format. You can print the current settings with codedefaults read/code.  precodedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Back" = "@\UF702"; "Go Back" = "@\UF702"; "Forward" = "@\UF703"; "Go Forward" = "@\UF703"; "Minimize" = "\0"; }'  defaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Show Package Contents" = "@\r"; }' /code/pre  <answer81012> The above answer is too complicated.  With Keynote 9 (v 5.3) and Mountain Lion, and assuming that the format bar is visible, you can simply define a key in Keyboard Shortcuts panel of the Keyboard System Preference:  ol liSelect "Application Shortcuts", and click the + icon/li liSelect the Keynote application./li liFor the Menu Title type the font name exactly as it appears in the format bar.  I entered "Times New Roman".  /li liType the shortcut key (I used kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd)./li liQuit Keynote and restart it./li liSelect some text and type the shortcut key.  The font will change to Times New Roman./li /ol  <comment78644> Could you explain why Paul Irish's dotfiles made you think about that or pinpoint the actual code you are referring to? <comment78659> I've defined the shortcuts via the System Preferences  Keyboard panel. Should/can I do this via a text editor? That'd be better for sure. <comment78660> The big thing is that application shortcuts go into the app preference file and system wide ones, the system pref file. You can use `PlistBuddy` and `plutil` to systematically convert a text file into property list additions as well as to issue `defaults write` commands to append them. This is advanced scripting, but doable for a DIY hacker. <comment78662> Awesome. Thanks, bmike.
