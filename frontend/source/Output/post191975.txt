MBPr early-2013 display turns off by itself <body> I've been recently experiencing random issues where the display turns off by itself strongwhile the MBPr is connected to the TV via HDMI/strong.  The computer is not responding even if I press the power button for a minute. Keyboard/trackpad does nothing. But after awhile (can be after 5 to 15 minutes later) for whatever reason, the screen comes back on as if nothing happens. I'm still logged in to OS X and I see the last app that was being used (most often this would be VLC or safari as I also watched Netflix via browser).  ol liHas anyone experienced this? if yes, what did you do? can it be a software/OS failure? I'm running 10.10.3/li liCan this be a symptom of the display problem which resulted in the  MBPr repair program that was started earlier in the year? https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues//li /ol  Thanks very much
