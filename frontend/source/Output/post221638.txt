Installed Snow Leopard on VirtualBox but can't install guest additions <body> My host machine is Windows 7. I installed Snow Leopard on VirtualBox but i am having problem installing the guest additions. The guest additions iso is mounted in code/Volumes/VBOXADDITIONS_4/code. But if I run the install command codesudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditons.run/code I get codeUnable to determaine library path/code.   Is installing guest additions for Mac OS X on VirtualBox even possible?   <answer221639> From Virtualbox Manual : Chapter 14:      strong14.2. Known Issues/strongbr   Mac OS X guests:br   VirtualBox does not provide Guest Additions for Mac OS X at this time   What you are trying to run is the script for Linux distributions. That does not work on OS X due to numerous differences in the system, despite a similar-ish base.  From the content of this, I wouldn't hold out for such support in VirtualBox any time soon.  <comment268423> The only version of Snow Leopard licensed to virtualise on any host is the server version. That & all versions from Lion upwards are licensed for virtualisation on Apple hardware only. No other usage is permitted by Apple's EULA. <comment359171> A workaround would be to create a `*.iso` and insert that. There might be some way to create `*.iso`files on windows like on mac.
