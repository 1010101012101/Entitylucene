Can you prevent iMessage texts from being deleted? <body> Is there any way to prevent deleting iMessage history? Can a particular iMessage with someone be archived so I don't accidentally delete?  Thanks!  <answer275032> No, there's no built-in way to archive iMessage history.    The only way to keep messages is to copy/paste them somewhere and then sync that to all your iCloud devices (or to back them up via your preferred archival method).  <answer275040> I'm not sure if its what you're looking for, but there is a setting called emMessage History/em that keeps messages from being auto-deleted after a certain amount of time.  You can find it in codeSettings -&gt; Messages -&gt; Keep Messages/code. Make sure it's set to Forever instead of 30 Days or 1 Year.  <answer275045> Although not a strict answer to your question, you can archive all messages off-line, including attached images, by using the iExplorer app from Macroplant. It comes in macOS and Windows flavors, too.   Although a bit pricy (US$50) it is an incredible tool for accessing the data on your iOS devices that Apple makes impossible or difficult to do.  [Disclaimer: I'm a happy iExplorer customer. I have no financial stake in the Macroplant.]  <comment345914> Thanks, that's a good feature. Unfortunately it won't stop me from accidentally deleting months worth of convo like I was hoping to have (archive or lock). <comment345971> Take a ton of screenshots :D
