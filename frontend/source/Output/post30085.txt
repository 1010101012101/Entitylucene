How can I sync places between iPhone and computer? <body> I'm looking for a way to drop pins on the map from my computer and have those pins accessible on my iPhone.  I know Maps app has Bookmarks but it appears I can't sync them with Google account or anything. Can I achieve this functionality, with or without third-party apps?  <answer30088> Google Places does exactly that.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZuqj.png" alt="Google Places web"  You can manage places through web interface or the iPhone app.br Places marked with a star (strongSaved for later/strong) will be displayed in strongSaved/strong section in the app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZfSn.png" alt="Google Places app"  You can rate and review places from the app as well.
