Unable to open Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac on my MacPro <body> I keep getting the following error message when I try to open any of my PowerPoint files on my Mac Pro.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pth6H.png" alt="You can&#39;t open the application &quot;Microsoft PowerPoint&quot; because it is not responding"  Any suggestions?  <comment261331> it **could** be that it is still running/hung in the background. Have you tried the "universal fix?" In other words have you rebooted? If so have you then run the Office installer and selected "Repair?" <comment261521> I turned off my computer and turned it back on. Same result. Are you saying I should delete and reinstall? <comment261531> It was running in the background. Problem fixed thank you!!!
