How to reassign default editor for different file types from the command line? <body> I am looking for a way to reassign default editor on OS X. For example I want to reassign all file types opened by TextEditor with TextWrangler.  Probably it has something to do with the codedefaults/code command but I do not know how to list current assignments and change them.   <answer19753> You might want to take a look at this question on Super User. It's not really as easy as editing code.plist/code file with codedefaults/code.  <answer19755> There is a command line utility called Duti which can do this.  http://duti.sourceforge.net/  There is no easy way to do this using built-in commands.
