How to regain warnings about permanent version storage? <body> With Preview in Mountain Lion, I carelessly checked the box –  [√] Do not show this message again  – emimagining/em that the preference was for just strongone/strong volume.   Then realised that the warning (the sheet):   ul lino longer appears for Preview, with strongother/strong volumes that do not support permanent version storage/li licontinues to appear for apps other than Preview, with the volume where I don't require the warning. /li /ul  In other words, I imagined wrong. The preference may be strongapp/strong-specific, not volume-specific.   Please:   ul lihow do I regain the warnings in Preview?/li /ul  Already I sped through code~/Library/Preferences/code sorted by modification date, and opened a few files including codecom.apple.finder.plist/code but at a glance:   ul liI can't find any code.plist/code with content that includes the string emrevision/em/li /ul  If the preference is elsewhere in codecom.apple.finder.plist/code: where?   (I'd prefer to not abandon that file – it's 35 KB with 3,417 lines.)  Also I viewed the content of recently modified code.plist/code files relating to Preview. Unless I'm missing something, nothing relating to revisions, versions or storage. codecom.apple.Preview.plist/code is strongnot/strong recently modified –  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JlGQj.png" alt="com.apple.Preview.* preference files"  – and within those nine, the two that are recently modified seem to contain nothing relating to permanent version storage:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QKZY0.png" alt="screenshot of a .plist in TextWrangler"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OvTNX.png" alt="screenshot of a .plist in TextWrangler"  Any other ideas on how to correct my mistake? – Thanks  <answer70946> h1For apps that are not sandboxed/h1  Example:   h2To regain warnings about permanent version storage for Apple Pages/h2  Quit the app, then a one-line command in Terminal:   precodedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Pages NSDocumentSuppressTempVersionStoreWarning -int 0 /code/pre  – in the codePreferences/code area that's familiar to users of Snow Leopard and less.   h1For apps that are sandboxed/h1  The operating system uses a different approach to containment of some preferences:   code~/Library/Containers/&lt;bundle_id&gt;/Data/Library/Preferences/code  Example:  h2To regain warnings about permanent version storage for Apple Preview/h2  Quit the app, then a one-line command in Terminal:   precodedefaults write ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview NSDocumentSuppressTempVersionStoreWarning -int 0 /code/pre  h3Thoughts/h3  I should have thought first of code~/Library/Containers/code when, in the question, I observed –     codecom.apple.Preview.plist/code is strongnot/strong recently modified    – but I didn't realise what was going on until after I used fseventer to visualise writes for a different user of the OS.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvitJ.jpg" alt="screenshot of Quick Look of a sandboxed preference file for Preview"  hr  h1References/h1  App Sandbox Design Guide: Migrating an App to a Sandbox  A visual record of me finding the relevant key in the code.plist/code for Pages  A visual record of me finding the relevant key in the code.plist/code for Preview  <comment82156> Shouldn't you rather look at `*preview.plist` instead of `*finder.plist`? <comment82163> @patrix already done, please see [revision 2](http://apple.stackexchange.com/revisions/70740/2) of the question. In revision 3 there's additional detail. <comment82175> Why don't you find out which, if any, .plist is involved just by saving them elsewhere, letting the System to create new ones, and just replace these with the old ones?
