Album purchased in iTunes but not in library <body> Immediately after pressing "purchase" for an album in iTunes, a number "1" quickly flashes next to download icon at bottom of screen.  However, album never shows up in "purchased" or "downloaded" files or in my library. I hit "purchase" twice, same thing both times.
