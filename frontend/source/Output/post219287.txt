External monitor does not display in full screen <body> I've connected my external monitor (Dell 2240L 21.5") to my Macbook Air running OS X Yosemite through a mini-display port to VGA convertor.  The problem is that the external monitor does not renders display on full screen. Rather, it is cropped from both right and left edges (around 1 inch from both sides is unused)  What I've tried:  ul liOverscan/Underscan. The slider is not visible in display settings/li liPlayed with Pixel Clock in the monitor's settings/li liTried all the resolutions in strongSystem Preferences/strong - strongDisplay/strong even by pressing strongalt/option/strong key on codescaled/code bullet (it shows more resolution options)/li liTried changing the aspect ratio from the monitor's settings/li /ul  1920x1080 resolution looks fine but the display is trimmed from the sides. How can I correct this?   <comment265199> First thing I'd try is *not* use VGA. <comment265200> @Tetsujin It used to work fine earlier but thanks for the suggestion. I will try connecting it with HDMI, hope it works. <comment266461> @Tetsujin Update: Thanks for your suggestion once again. I connected it with HDMI and it works fine :) <comment266465> Glad it worked :)
