Is there an iPhone app that takes continuous photos? <body> I am looking for an app that can take continuous photos.  In other words, I should be able to set the interval (e.g. every 3 seconds) and for how long (e.g. 2 minutes) and it would just snap photos.  Does something like that exists?  <answer57133> Try Triggertrap, it has time lapse and other options to trigger a photo. It works with the iPhone's camera or, if you purchase the appropriate cable, you can hook it up to a dslr. The free version is limited but I think provides the functionality you're looking for.  Triggertrap Mobile  <answer57299> I've used iTimeLapse a couple times and it seems pretty good.  iTimeLapse Pro  <answer197276> If you can update to iOS 8, then you can have this Time Lapse feature for free from Apple.
