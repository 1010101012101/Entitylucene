Applescript to fill in Keychain dialog box <body> I'd like to fill in the Keychain Dialog box with the Name: and Password fields (printer is windows print queue), but after the Print command, the Keychain dialog box opens up, but never responds to anything till I click OK or cancel.   precode  tell application "TextEdit"   activate   make new document    print document 1 with properties {target printer:"2nd-floor"}    tell application "System Events"           set value of text field 1 of group 1 of window 1 to "CUA\name"           click button 2 of window 1 of application process "SecurityAgent"    end tell   end tell /code/pre  Hope I missing something silly, thanks.  <answer134556> Consider altering the requirement for a password. Printers on Mac OS X are managed by the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) and it is highly configurable.  Mac OS X Hints published this, Disable printer queue password requirements, for disabling printer queue passwords. It should work for modern versions of OS X:     ol   liAs root, or in a Terminal session with codesu/code privileges, edit code/etc/cups/cupsd.conf/code./li   liFind the section below./li   liRemove the items you don't want limited: codePause-Printer/code, codeResume-Printer/code, codePause-Printer-After-Current-Job/code, etc./li   liSave the file, quit the editor, and restart your computer/li   /ol   Section to find and edit:  precode  &lt;Limit Pause-Printer Resume-Printer Enable-Printer Disable-Printer Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job Hold-New-Jobs Release-Held-New-Jobs Deactivate-Printer Activate-Printer Res tart-Printer Shutdown-Printer Startup-Printer Promote-Job Schedule-Job-After CUPS-Accept-Jobs CUPS-Reject-Jobs&gt;       AuthType Default       Require user @AUTHKEY(system.print.admin) @admin @lpadmin       Order deny,allow   &lt;/Limit&gt; /code/pre  <comment159244> I think this all refers to the Administrative password for the Mac you are trying to print from.  I am looking to enter the domain\username and password for the windows print queue  (smb:\\server.com\printqueue) that our students are trying to print to. <comment159252> Have you considered embedding your credentials in the `smb://` URL or used `smbpasswd` to store the password securely? http://willem.engen.nl/projects/cupssmb/ and http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/CUPS-printing.html might be useful for this approach. <comment159256> Since my university forces students to change passwords every 6 months, I originally thought that would not work.  But the installing printers part of my applescript works well,  so that I am going to look at that method.   It would mean they would have to run the script again in 6 months when their password expires, but they were going to have to update their keychain anyway, thanks for the suggestion -Len
