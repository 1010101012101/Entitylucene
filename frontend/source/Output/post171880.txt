Google Maps on iPhone wont update map orientation as I cycle <body> Goole Maps on my iPhone have has stopped changing the orientation of the map in cycling mode.   The first image is a screengrab of Apple's maps. You can see the arrow is the same direction as the direction im going.   The second image is a screengrab of Google Maps. I cant get the map to update as I make turns so that the arrow is the same direction as me. Im talking about how car GPSs always work.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sbVBq.png" width="250" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0CHq.png" width="250"  <answer171887> Tap the 'North Up' symbol, then the next view will go back to Head Up.br [I can't check 'live' as I'm sitting at my compy, but that works for static route lists.]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fHA0w.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment202295> I don't see a setting for that like apple maps has.  If the behavior changed with an update send feedback.
