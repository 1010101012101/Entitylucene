Multiple languages and Emoji button on iOS keyboard <body> I'm using German and English keyboard on my iPhone and want to insert emojis easily. The problem is when you have 2 languages and emoji, it only jumps to the next keyboard. This is very annoying.  Is there a possibility to have a language button (German/English/â€¦) and a emoji button?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O8nq7.png" width="320"  <answer199212> No, this is not possible.  You can quickly switch to a specific keyboard by holding down on the keyboard language button and sliding your finger to the specific keyboard.  Also, the keyboard order is always fixed, so you know to double-tap the keyboard language button to go to a specific keyboard from another specific keyboard.  <answer252215> Yes it is possible. Just add emoji as a keyboard!  <comment238653> This is truely terribly annoying. <comment238660> Thanks for your answer. But is there an alternative keyboard that supports this feature? <comment238698> You can select another language without having to tap the globe button multiple times by long-tapping it <comment238721> @lukas that's what grgarside already said... <comment313537> FWIW, iOS 10 coming next week supports multi-language keyboards. That means you can keep a single keyboard for multiple languages and it will give you auto-correct etc. for all of them. It works surprisingly well. You would then have the emoji keyboard right next to to the main one.

Best to delete your answer to avoid that impression.
