MacBook detects a phantom display <body> I have a probably hardware broken MacBook (Late 2006), which detects an external display without any displays having attached. This happens with a brand new OS X (Lion) install too. The phantom display is named spdisplays_display and have a 800x600 resolution.  How can I turn this display off from software?  I have tried mirroring the display, but that results 800x600 on the internal display too. My other option was to use SwitchResX to set the external display's resolution to match the internal's, but if there is only one way I want to avoid using SwitchResX. (And I think moving the display data for the external phantom display too consumes more power and also makes the machine slower, so turning off would be a better idea.)
