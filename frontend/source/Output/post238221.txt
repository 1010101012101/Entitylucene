Bootcamp [in another partition] running as Virtual Machine on Mac <body> I have strongOS X/strong in partition codedisk1s2/code and strongWindows/Bootcamp/strong in codedisk1s3/code.  Is there a way of running this Windows (codedisk1s3/code) as virtual machine while I am on OS X?  I read something like that for Linux + Windows and a tutorial from Lifehacker to use Parallels, but this is paid and Virtualbox should be better for me, since it's free.  <comment292024> Which version of Windows? I used to do this with Windows XP and VMWare but later Windows licenses don't allow this <comment292027> @Mark Windows 10. I am running OK right now with Parallels Trial. <comment292058> VMWare & Parallels, time to pull out your credit card :) I personally recommend VMWare because of balancing simplicity & performance :)
