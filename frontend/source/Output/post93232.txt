What is the difference between an "iOS App Development" certificate and an "In-House and Ad Hoc" one? <body> I am a member of my employer's corporate Apple account, and I am building a test app. To get it deployed, I created an "iOS App Development" certificate, after registering my device's UDID as required, and that all works fine.  Now, searching Stack Overflow and other places, I find information like to install to a second device I can just plug the new device in and copy across from XCode, without using up another of my 100 device registrations. Furthermore, an "In-House and Ad Hoc" certificate will allow me to share the app throughout the enterprise.  However, there are still a number of questions outstanding:  ol liDoes the iOS App Development certificate give me any extra rights on my registered device?/li liDoes the iOS App Development certificate give me any extra rights on unregistered devices?/li liDo I actually need an iOS App Development certificate, or will an In-House and Ad Hoc one do everything I need?/li liDoes an In-House and Ad Hoc certificate have no technical install limitations, just the legal force of the user agreement?/li /ol  <answer93235> subSource of everything I'm about to say: iOS developership./sub  h3First of all.../h3  You strongcan not/strong deploy a development app on a second device without using another one of your 100 devices.

The development cert may only be installed on registered devices./li listrongYes/strong, if you are serious about development. You could get by with only an ad-hoc cert, but it would be cumbersome, and you wouldn't be able to use hugely helpful Xcode debugging features like Breakpoints and logging./li listrongI don't know/strong, but I would assume so./li /ol  <comment109368> Thanks for these answers! I'd obviously misunderstood the ability to install to a second device from XCode. So, an important reason to use a development certificate (and a key difference from an Ad Hoc cert) is to enable debugging on a physical device? <comment109370> @KenY-N Yes, it enables debugging tethered to Xcode, giving you some nice info when debugging stuff. <comment109399> Lets close this to clean up what's really being solved here. We generally close two part questions and ask that individual questions get asked. <comment109400> Also - perhaps hit us up on [meta] and/or [chat] if its not clear where the line between developer ( Stack Overflow) and user/enterprise ( Ask Different ) lies.
