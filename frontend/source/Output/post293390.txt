macOS: Can't mount exFAT External Drive <body> I have a Western Digital MyBook (25EE) 8TB External Drive. It is formatted with exFAT. I can't recall exactly how it was formatted, but I believe it was done with Synology's DiskStation for my Synology NAS.  I am able to mount and read the drive when I connect it to the NAS, but not on emmacOS Sierra 10.12.6/em.  The drive shows up in Disk Utility, but mounting does nothing. I have run "First Aid" with no errors.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WPyxf.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvzoR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Disk Utility incorrectly thinks that the usage is 8/8 TB. As can be in a screenshot below, usage is around 4.2/8 TB. The drive mainly contains a Synology HyperBackup file (.hbk) which makes up almost single-handedly all of those 4.2 TB.  According to Synology DiskStation, the main partition is exFAT and I think the EFI  partition is vfat:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LM7H5.png" alt="enter image description here"  The drive also shows up in codediskutil/code as codedisk2s2/code but I can't mount it:   precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *8.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:       Microsoft Basic Data WD My Book              8.0 TB     disk2s2  $ mount disk2s2 mount: disk2s2: unknown special file or file system.  $ diskutil mountDisk disk2 One or more volume(s) failed to mount /code/pre   NB: (I tried following these instructions for FUSE for macOS, but I suppose they're not really relevant since exFAT should be supported natively in macOS these days.)

It has many pros and cons. One of the pros, for instance, is file size limit's now up to 16 Exabytes. But...   It's not used and was not designed for formatting hard drives. It is only recommended for strongflash memory storage/strong. That's the only reason it is currently not considered as huge competitor to codeNTFS/code on hard drives. Also codeexFAT/code contributes to the emergence of permission problems and corrupted files. Suppose your situation is related to this issue.  I would try to reformat it although you've got 8TB to transfer.  <comment370164> Hmmm; [Disable the disk check when reconnecting an improperly disconnected disk to OS X](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/230712/93229) may help - last-ditch <comment370331> @klanomath Sorry for the delayed response – I tried nulling the *fsck* per your instructions but it didn't seem to do anything, mounting the disk failed as before, so I removed the line from *fstab* again. <comment371076> Are the permissions of the drive correct? <comment371757> @littletinyman How can I check permissions of the drive? Thanks!
