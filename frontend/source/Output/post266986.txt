Available space not equal to the sum of space taken by all the apps listed on iOS 9 <body> I have one iPhone 4s 8GB version which I updated to iOS 9.3.5 and when I see the storage available, I got 4.2 GB after installing some apps. When I counted the sum total of storage consumed by all apps, it was only &lt; 300 MB. But, it showed that the usage is 866 MB.  I tried hard resetting the phone, (Erase all content) and after restart, I selected Setup new iPhone (instead of restoring from backup). However, I have restored backup of WhatsApp from WhatsApp app itself.  The iCloud backup size of WhatsApp is also 5.1MB only and that of the entire phone is &lt; 100MB only. I have gone through this post and did the same way, but still iOS available space doesn&#39;t add up and also from iPhone available space: significant difference between iTunes and iPhone but still, there is 500MB missing somewhere?  I don't currently have Windows OS/Mac to install iTunes, I use Linux Mint and iTunes doesn't detect iPhone in Wine (on Linux) and I also can't install VirtualBox due to some reasons.  If the solution to this problem requires iTunes, then I may need to install Windows.  Edit: I updated my iPhone from iOS 7.0 to 8.4.1 and then finally to 9.3.5. After that I erased all its contents. Are the iOS downlodaed installation files still there on my iPhone?  <comment334913> I would check to see why you can't install Virtual Box. <comment334997> Just because, I don't want to clutter up my linux os with all that. I would like to know after I install, how to clean it up. <comment335003> @SherwoodBotsford If I have iTunes, I can see how much space the 'Other' is occupying, but how do I clean it? If backup be the only way, then I could as well do it with iCloud (since I have very less, backup 10 MB or so), apart from just 'knowing' how much space does the 'Other' occupy do I have any other use of iTunes for this problem?
