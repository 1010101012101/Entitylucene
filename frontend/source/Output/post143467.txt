iPhone 5s: internet not working on 2.4 Ghz WiFi <body> couple months back I have purchased my first 5Ghz AC wifi router and since than I'm having problems with my iPhone to access internet on 2.4 Ghz networks (any router). Sometimes it works, but most of the time it does not, only if I quickly switch airplane mode on/off it briefly works. I have tried to reset the network settings and it helps but since my home network is 5Ghz, reseting it all the time is not viable solution.  Here are 3 speed tests:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vuOnn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  First one before Airplane mode, second right after air plane mode, third is 30 seconds after airplane mode.  Thanks for any help!  iPhone 5s, iOS 7.1.2  <comment168988> nice graphics for speed test. more interesting would be the console log. <comment169010> Any hint how to get a console log out of a non-jailbroken iPhone?
