Selecting print sizes on Pages <body> I'm new to "Pages" on my OS X, El Capitan, and when trying to print a page with several photo images on it, I don't know what size photo paper to name on the page-size menu.    The photo paper I want, and placed in my Epsom printer is 4X6 (inches).  In searching on line for a technical name for this size, it seems that A6 might be correct.   Unfortunately in Pages, the paper size menu doesn't list either 4X6, or A6.  It uses another code language, with size names like JIS B5, ROC 16K, A5(emno A6/em), but has no listing of their dimensions.   My work-around solution would be to move the document out of Pages, and try to print it through my Mac "Preview" app, but I already gave up on that (originally editing my 4-pic document on "TextEdit", so I decided to try Pages, because when using Preview, I couldn't seem to get the whole document to appear on a 4X6... it wants to print 2 of the pics on "pg1", and then the next 2 pics on "pg2".  <comment330180> You may need something like GrsphicConvertor to reduce the size or your images and create a new one that incorporates them in 4x6.
