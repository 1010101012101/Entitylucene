xxd not found in Recovery Mode, Mac OS X 10+ <body> In Recovery Mode, I was trying to access my password hashes, except bash 3.2 returned codecommand not found/code for codexxd/code.   Any help would be appreciated.  <answer220535> The recovery partition neither contains emxxd/em nor emod/em. Use the one installed to the main OS X volume by entering:  precode/Volumes/NameOfMainVolume/usr/bin/xxd /code/pre  Don't forget to escape spaces in the name of your main OS X volume with a backslash. If you want to save something to a file also use your main volume. The Base OS X you are booted to is read-only and all the smaller r/w disks with less than ~50 MB are lost after a restart because they are in RAM.   <comment266938> I can't access my recovery partition now, but 'od' has a hex mode. Does recovery have that? <comment266942> Or quote the command line if it has spaces, but not both. <comment267037> As a side q, what does xxd do? <comment267060> @FlareCat, Read the `man` page for `xxd`. From `man xxd`: "xxd - make a hexdump or do the reverse." <comment267103> @user3439894 oh sorry, completely forgot about man.
