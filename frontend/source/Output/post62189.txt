Cron doesn't run after installing Mountain Lion. How can I make them run again? <body> My Cron tasks stopped running after I installed Mountain Lion.  How do I get them to run again?  <answer62190> The resolution turned out to be creating the etc/crontab file (e.g., codesudo touch /etc/crontab/code).  Apparently, this file was deleted during the installation of Mountain Lion.  <comment71821> +1 for even having cron around so long after launchd was christened and cron was deprecated.
