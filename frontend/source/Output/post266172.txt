Why does buying full Apple Music clear my music? <body> I recently had a free trial of apple music that just expired. When I bought the full version all of my downloaded music was gone. I used the same apple ID and the same device, just different payment info. Can I get my music back without re downloading it all? Where did i go wrong? And is this a feature or bug?
