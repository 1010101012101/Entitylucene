Home sharing library doesn't show up on iPhone 5 (9.3.2) no matter what I do <body> I'm trying to make my iTunes (12.5.1.21) music library show up in Music on my iPhone 5 (9.3.2). Nothing seems to work, i.e. whatever I try nothing shows up under the My Music tab on my phone (empty view telling me to find some music).   Apple's instructions to use Home Sharing on iOS are:     On the screen that appears, tap the category near the middle of the screen. Then tap Home Sharing and choose a shared Library to connect to.   Obviously, there is no such control in the empty view.  Steps taken, with no effect:  ul liOSX firewall is not enabled./li liActivated Home sharing using the same Apple ID on both iPhone and Mac./li liUpdated to latest iTunes (12.5.1.21). Support for iOS 9 was added in version 12.3.0.44./li liEnabled sharing the whole library in iTunes settings (although I'm under the impression that that is a separate feature from home sharing)./li liDeauthorized and re-authorized the mac, and reactivated home sharing./li liRestarted iTunes, killed the Music app./li liRestarted mac and phone./li liLogged out of home sharing on phone, waited 15 minutes, logged in again./li liDisabled screen lock and let the phone sit with Music app open./li liEnabled Apple Music in iOS, even though I have no interest in it./li liRestarted router./li liChecked that the required ports aren't blocked in the router, as per Apple troubleshooting instruction, although I fail to see how that would affect things since both my devices are inside the same LAN behind that firewall./li liConfirmed that the itunes remote app for iOS could find itunes./li /ul  Are there any magical constraints to Home Sharing they're not telling me?  <comment317077> You might have to put one song on it to make it work, I'm not sure. <comment317078> Yeah maybe, I wouldn't put it past them. If so it would be a pretty ironic misunderstanding of their own feature.
