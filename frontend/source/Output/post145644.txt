Mail/iCal: How to decline with text / answer mail? <body> I am using Mail/iCal with a corporate Exchange server.  With Outlook (yuck!) or its "OWA" approximation, I can answer (accept/maybe/decline) with or without editing the reply mail.  In Mail or iCal, I know three working ways to accept/decline, but I don't see how to edit the reply.  (Plus, after declining, the mail/event is gone, so I also cannot reply to the mail anymore.)  <answer169694> At least on iOS devices, version 8.1.3, this is now directly possible when tapping "decline" using the provided comment field.  <comment222538> Yes, the situation has improved in iOS 8. I wrote the question when I was still using iOS 7.
