Moving the save dialog? <body> I have the following emfrequent/em issue (since I read a lot of PDFs for my job): I open a PDF in a browser on my computer (e.g., Chrome, but this happens on other browsers as well) and I go to save it. I typically like to name the file something like "author,author-name of article (year).pdf". But the save dialog box completely obscures the top of the PDF (even when the dialog is in its small version), so I can no longer see the information that I want to use to name the file.   (Obviously I can first write down the filename in another program and then copy it into the save dialog, but that's a pain, esp. given the number of times I want to do this each day.)  I understand that save dialogs are typically "sheets", which are attached to the top of the window. My question is:     Is there any kind of systematic work-around for this issue?   I know about Default Folder X, but as far as I can tell that's just like a nicer version of Finder, and won't resolve my issue (please correct me if wrong, in which case I would probably be willing to pay more for Default Folder X than they're asking for!). I have tried Googling this issue for quite some time, but it's somewhat difficult because if you include the word "sheet" it typically gives you junk about excel, and the word "movable" typically gives you stuff about moving files.  <comment264939> I'm a big fan of Default Folder X - but it cannot move Save dialogs that drop from the title-bar of a window itself, only 'regular' ones that are not attached.
