iPhone 6 charging best practices <body> ol liShould I charge every night? (Assuming that I consume more than 50% during the day, but sometimes not much more.)/li liShould I turn off the device during the charge?

Ars Technica explains why:     Full discharges put a lot of strain on the battery, and it's much better practice to do shallow discharges to no lower than 20 percent. In a way, this is like people running for exercise— running a few miles a day is fine, but running a marathon every day is generally not sustainable.   Turning off the device may assist slightly in lowering heat, which in turn may extend the life of the battery by a minuscule amount, but it is not really enough to worry about.  <answer158475> There’s no need to let it discharge 100% before recharging. Apple lithium-ion batteries work in charge cycles. You complete one charge cycle when you’ve used (discharged) an amount that equals 100% of your battery’s capacity — but not necessarily all from one charge. For instance, you might use 75% of your battery’s capacity one day, then recharge it fully overnight. If you use 25% the next day, you will have discharged a total of 100%, and the two days will add up to one charge cycle.   ...
