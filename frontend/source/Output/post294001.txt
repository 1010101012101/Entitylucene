.bash_profile + vim colourisation <body> I'm a bit confused as to the colour schemes within vim in iterm.  Here is my situation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6XS6H.png" alt="enter image description here"  as you can see on the left terminal panel there is a lot more colourisation than on the right one (black/grey backgrounds excluded as it's a result of focus).  LEFT: '.bash_profile' RIGHT: '.bashAliases'  I don't understand why the difference.  I would like to use the colourisation on the right.  Anybody any ideas?  Thanks  OSX: 10.11.6  Terminal: iTerm2 Build 3.0.15  Vim: 7.3   .vimrc:  precodecolo elflord syntax on set number /code/pre
