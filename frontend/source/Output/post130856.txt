Is it possible to switch the keyboard layout automatically as soon as I start typing? <body> On my Macbook Pro, I routinely use two keyboards:  #1 is Apple Keyboard (A1243) with International English layout  #2 is Apple Keyboard (A1048) with French layout.  I already have set up a keyboard shortcut to switch language, but I'm looking for a way to automatically switch the language as soon as I begin typing on a given keyboard.   Does the OS even know which layout each keyboard has?  precode        Apple Pro Keyboard:            Product ID: 0x020c           Vendor ID: 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.)

I could maybe take advantage of the fact that I'm using two different models. I'm open to a low level solution (something like listening to keyboard inputs and switch language accordingly, if you can find the origin on the USB bus of a keystroke, but it would be a programming question for StackOverflow I guess).  <comment153584> Keyboards are all electrically the same, just the printing is different.  What a key produces is determined by the software on the machine and is normally the same for all attached keyboards.  But I think I have heard that Keyremap4Macbook can distinguish between hardware keyboards, so you may want to check that app.
