Sync play count from device to iTunes library <body> Library has 30,000 songs--I auto fill iPod with about 1300 songs. After a few hundred songs have played on the iPod I sync back to iTunes. I sort the 1300 songs by play count--and delete all songs with a play count  0.  Auto fill again for more random music.  Back in my library of 30,000 songs the play count is unchanged--all still zero. I'm obviously not playing the music directly in iTunes.   Should the play count be sync'd all the way back to the library?  Is it capable?   What's the goal--to play 30,000 songs on a iPod (that obviously can't hold that much music at once) minimizing a track from repeating--or better said, preventing a track from never being played.
