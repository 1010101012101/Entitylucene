Can I receive local or push notifications to my email address? <body> Can I receive local and/or push notifications to my email account instead of as a notification that appears on my iPhone?   I want to receive the local and push notifications for some apps but I don't want to necessarily receive them as pop-up notifications on my iPhone screen, but would rather access them in my inbox when I have time.  <answer90962> The short answer is No.  iOS does not have any way for you to redirect notifications.  It may be possible to change how emsome/em notifications are sent, and have them sent to you via Boxcar or something similar, but that is going to be limited to a very small subset of applications or services which are designed to offer alternatives. Twitter and Facebook come to mind.
