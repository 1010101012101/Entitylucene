Unarchive a file with a set of provided password list <body> Is there a possibility like in jDownloader, where password protected files are automatically extracted by trying all passwords one by one which are provided by the user?  Something like this:  precode$ unarchive foo.rar --password-list baz.txt /code/pre  <answer221894> ul liGet codeunar/code from http://unarchiver.c3.cx/commandline/li liExtract the archive and put codeunar/code (and codelsar/code) somewhere your shell can find it./li liRun  precodewhile IFS= read pwd; do     unar -p "$pwd" ARCHIVE done &lt; password-list.txt /code/pre/li /ul  <answer222004> The solution from @patrix works perfect, except for the case, when the password is not available in the provided list, then the archive will produce a lot of 0 byte files. My changed solution checks, if a password matches, then it's continues to unarchive.  precodewhile IFS= read pwd; do     if lsar -t "$1" -p "$pwd" | grep "[1-9][0-9]* passed" -E -q; then         unar -p "$pwd" "$1"         break     fi done &lt; password-list.txt /code/pre  <comment268745> Which specific unarchiver are you using? <comment268746> @patrix Thanks for your comment! There is no specific unarchiver I use, because the ones I use don't provide this functionality, thus I'm searching for one, which can already do that, if there is any. <comment268791> Awesome, thank you very much! <comment268921> You should provide your edited solution as an answer, not by editing the question. <comment268923> @grgarside Alright, I added it as an answer. I don't have to check it as solution do I? <comment268924> @Byte No, it's fine to leave the other answer as accepted. Putting your answer as an answer makes it easier to see the development of the solution and is less confusing to search/SEO. <comment269087> Ah, great. I didn't have any password-protected archives to test it with.
