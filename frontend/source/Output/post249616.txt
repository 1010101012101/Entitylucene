How to enable iTerm2's system-wide hotkey when iTem2 is not running <body> For me system-wide hotkey does not work when iTerm2 is closed. Is there a way to enable it? Or maybe create an instance of iTerm that runs invisibly in background and listens for hotkey?  <answer249633> Follow these three steps:  ol liLaunch codeAutomator/code from code/Applications/Utilities/code. Create a service for launching iTerm in Automator in these steps:  1.1. In the first window select codeService/code and press codeChoose/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xAjhE.jpg" alt="Automator Create new Service"  1.2. From left sidebar select codeUtilities/code. From middle section drag codeLaunch Application/code to the right section and select codeiTerm/code from the its dropdown list. Select codeno input/code from upper dropdown list. Save the document by kbdcommand/kbd+kbdS/kbd and provide a meaningful name like codeLaunch iTerm/code./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HnwRb.jpg" alt="Launch iTerm workflow"  ol start="2" liOpen codeSystem Preferences/code and open codeKeyboard/code section.
