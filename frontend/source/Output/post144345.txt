Standard user cannot change password <body> On my macbook, running OSX Mavericks, my daughter has a standard-user account.   I wanted to show her how to change her login password under:   strongSystemPreferences  Users &amp; Groups  ChangePassword/strong    That button was greyed out, even after the padlock was opened.   Note: she is under parental control, but even after I temporarily lifted that, changing the password was not possible.  hr  strongAny ideas, on how to allow my daughter to change her login password?/strong  <answer144364> Okay, I just figured out what was wrong. I had actually disabled my daughter to change her password under parental control (ages ago when I've set it up). To undo that I had to   strongSystemPreferences  ParentialControls  Other/strong  where I could untick the box "Disable changing the password".  <comment170028> After you removed parental control, did she log out and in again? <comment170031> @patrix No, she didn't. <comment170032> Might be worth a try then (disable control, have her log out/in again and then change password) <comment170046> Is the change of a user password prohibited when the user is under parental control? <comment170050> Nope, but that part you figured out already. But AFAIK you need to log out/in if you switch an account from/to parental control
