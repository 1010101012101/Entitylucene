Adding safari-tabs in bulk to Instapaper with Applescript <body> firsttime user here - I'm not a programmer but sometimes have educated guesses on how to solve things with Applescript.  My aim: all open tabs in 1 safari-window - add those in bulk to my Instapaper-account.  I use the following code (thanks to whomever originally created this):  precode-- set theUsername to "my@example.org" -- set thePassword to "mybirthday"  tell application "Safari"     set theWindow to front window     set theTabs to theWindow's tabs --of every window     repeat with eachTab in theTabs         -- send current URL to instapaper         set theInstapaperResult to do shell script "curl \"https://www.instapaper.com/api/add?username=" &amp; theUsername &amp; "&amp;password=" &amp; thePassword &amp; "&amp;url=" &amp; URL of eachTab &amp; "\""         if theInstapaperResult is "403" then             display dialog "Seems like your username / password doesn't match" buttons ("Continue") default button 1 with icon stop             return         else             if theInstapaperResult is not "201" then                 display dialog "Something went wrong, I'm not sure what at this moment" buttons ("Continue") default button 1 with icon stop                 return             end if         end if         close eachTab     end repeat      -- if the window wasn't closed by closing the last tab, close it now :)     if theWindow exists then         close theWindow     end if  end tell /code/pre  On running this applescript, I get returned the message "emSomething went wrong, I'm not sure what at this moment/em" I assume this means that although my username &amp; password get successfully passed along to the Instapaper API, all is not well...  I do not know how to further tackle this problem - the documentation at Instapaper's simple API documentation is possibly helpful.  I'm running the latest version of macOS Sierra.  Only 1 Safariwindow is open, and I'm triggering the script from the script menulet.
