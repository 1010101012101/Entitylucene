Upgrading from Developer Preview to full OS <body> So long story short, I need to install 10.10.3 on a machine (later versions break a specific app I need). I have the 10.10.5 installer and I still have the 10.10 Developer Preview installer laying around. I've seen lots of previous posts saying if you don't have the installer you're out of luck for anything except 10.10.5. However since I have the DP, I installed that. Obviously it's buggy though and this is not useful. Is there any way to upgrade the DP to 10.10.3? I tried the combo update but it says it's not compatible.  <comment362459> Are the developers of the app aware? 10.10 is very old at this point. It most certainly should have been updated for later versions of 10.10 by now, or 10.11/10.12, if it's still being maintained. <comment362460> @WilliamTFroggard company out of business. But it integrates with a device we have to control a lot of the lighting in our theatre. And that device is critical. <comment362462> If you can find someone with access to the 10.10 GM candidate, they should still be able to download it, and you should be able to upgrade that to 10.10.3. Unfortunately, I only have access to the 10.11 GM candidate. <comment362463> @WilliamTFroggard so the 10.10 DP won't work? I might have the GM laying around somewhere or know someone who does. I'll give it a shot. <comment362464> The GM is basically the same thing as 10.10.0. You're normally able to upgrade it to later versions just like the release version. It should work. <comment362465> @WilliamTFroggard thanks I'll look around.
