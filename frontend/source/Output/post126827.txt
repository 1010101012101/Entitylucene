Firefox 28 search is easily interruptible <body> When I search on a Firefox page (kbdcommand-F/kbd) the search interrupts itself all the time.  E.g., I start typing "backtick" and, right before I hit codet/code, codeback/code disappears and I am now searching just for codet/code.  On the other hand, sometimes the search prompt in a tab persists: I go to another tab, and, when I get back to this one, the search prompt is still active with the old text in it.  This behavior started when I upgraded to FF28 a couple of days ago, however, I seem to recall that I experienced this sort of annoyance some time in the past.  Any idea what might be causing this?  <answer126872> Removing the extension "fast video download (with search menu)" solved the problem.   <comment148598> Just to let you know my FF28 in page Find, works fine on MBA 10.9.2
