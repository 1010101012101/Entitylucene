Disabling QuickType into my html form fields <body> I'm creating several html forms.   People asked me to remove the strongQuickType/strong functionality introduced with iOS 8 for some of those forms fields cause sometime it's irrevelant and use screen place for nothing.  It's seems strongQuickType/strong only appears for code&lt;input type="text"&gt;/code.  Even it has not been designed for that, I tried the codeautocomplete="off"/code and it doesn't work without a surprise.  I don't want to globaly desactivate strongQuickType/strong into the parameters or to temporary hide it with a strongswipe down/strong.  PS : strongQuickType/strong is not yet a tag, I propose to add it  <answer193157> It's answered on SO:     i put codeautocapitalize="off"/code codeautocomplete="off"/code codeautocorrect="off"/code      and it works.   The asker said codeautocapitalize="off"/code was not needed.
