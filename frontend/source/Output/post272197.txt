What is iTunes 12.5.5.5.5 saying to Apple? <body> On OS x 10.11.6, According to LittleSnitch, iTunes connects to Apple at boot up. I understand it wants to make some checks about account/user/authorisation. But if I sign out, disable the store and all other net based things (I do not use and have never used Apple Music, iCloud Music, or Apple Match) restart iTunes, it still connects to Apple. There is a steady up/down amount of info, a few 10s of k. What is being said? What is iTunes telling Apple and what is Apple asking of iTunes?  If left alone i.e. iTunes isn't playing anything (not purchased or own music), info is still exchanged/streams.
