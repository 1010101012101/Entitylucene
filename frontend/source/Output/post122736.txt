Using an external microphone with iPad Air or the new iPad Mini <body> I have an external USB microphone that works fine with the iPad 3 using the Camera Connection USB adapter and a USB hub for power. Can a similar setup be used for the new generation of iPads?  Edit: Just to be clear, an answer with practical experience or a link to someone who has verified this setup is preferred.  <answer122737> Theoretically, yes, it should still work fine. However, as I'm sure you're aware the iPad 3 does not have the Lightning connector. You will need to purchase a Lightning to USB Camera Adapter so that you can connect your USB device to the new iPads with Lightning connectors.  <comment143268> I'm more worried about the practical bit; theoretically a lot of things ought to work, but since Apple doesn't officially support them (and yet, it works in Garageband...), I'm a bit weary about plonking down a lot of money on new devices before someone who was verified it answers. Thanks for your time, though :) <comment143665> Bought Lightning-to-USB Camera Adapter, tested to work on iPad Mini 1G. <comment167170> Also tested to work on a iPad 3rd gen (Retina iPad)
