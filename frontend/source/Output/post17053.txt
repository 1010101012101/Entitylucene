iPhone 4 iTunes podcast list shows 3-4 words max? <body> I thought I would download a few podcasts with my iPhone.  I was sad to see that they all look like this:  ul liSome Person discusses .../li liFulano Tal shows how .../li liHow to fully setup a .../li /ul  How can I get a list that will wrap and show more than 3-4 words.   <answer21815> As far as I know this is not possible. The iPhone screen is just to small. I am using the Mac to search for podcasts.  Maybe some of the third party apps could help.  <answer24938> I suggest searching for podcasts on the iTunes web interface from within mobile Safari. Both Bing and Google accept a site parameter that will allow you to filter for a specific site. In thie case, you could search for a podcast and add the strongsite:itunes.apple.com/strong parameter at the end. Like this:      this week in tech site:itunes.apple.com   The search results in Safari should be easier to read. Each link should open in the iTunes app in your iPhone. Hope this helps.
