Unable to send email <body> I receive a msg "the recipient was rejected by the server because the user is unknown" when trying to send an email from me.com to icloud.com. Recipient is in Italy but I have no problem sending to hotmail.com in Italy   <answer286513> The error message you received is simple to understand.  The email address is invalid.  <comment361495> 'user is unknown' is a pretty clear rejection reason. The server doesn't have an account by that name. <comment361501> In other words... The first half of the email address is wrong or contains a typo.
