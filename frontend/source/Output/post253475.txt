I want to install Windows 10 on my 15in Macbook Pro Retina through Bootcamp, can I install Windows 10 on an SD card? <body> I recently purchased a 15in Macbook Pro for school, but I need to also run Windows for some programs I use for class. Could I install Windows 10 on my hard drive, and put Windows apps and games on a 256gb Micro SD card and run them off of the SD card instead of them running off my hard drive? Specs: Late 2013 15 in Macbook Pro, 2.3 GHz i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, nVidia 750m GPU, 512GB SSD.
