Internet connectivity not working outside Chrome <body> Recently, all internet connectivity seems to be down on my Mac outside Chrome. I've noticed it when I could no longer access App Store or FTP servers (through FileZilla but I've tried other clients as well). Firefox isn't working, either.  Everything's fine through Chrome (including FTP protocol) but nothing else would work.  Here's what I've tried: 1. I've made sure "Auto Proxy Discovery" is off 2. I've flushed DNS 3. I went ahead and cleared/refreshed all cache through OnyX  I'm running 2012 Mac Book Pro with El Capitan. Any help would be appreciated!  <comment364158> Google Chrome sometimes/often uses its own DNS resolution methods -  more or less independent of the system's mDNSresponder. So check your system's DNS/network settings and if applicable your router's DHCP/DNS settings.
