How do I boot from my Mac partition? <body> I tried to install Windows 7 on my Mac via Boot Camp, but the disk of Windows 7 doesn't work. When I tried to install the Windows 7 it shows a black screen.  Now I want to boot back to OS X, but I don't know how.  Do I have to re-insert the Mac disk? If yes, how can I take out the disk from the Mac?  <answer15676> Hold the kbdoption/kbd key when you power on and you can choose the working mac partition or insert a bootable DVD to get back to disk utility or a working os. This is called the Startup Manager screen.   The eject key will work once the Startup Manager is running so you can eject the windows DVD.   As I didn't explain the option key - here is a great article explaining how Mac users refer to the keys on the keyboard as well as some handy shortcuts for later once things work again.  <comment17062> I'll try thanks you! hmm, what is "Option" key? <comment17064> @Daniel The "option" key says "option" on Apple keyboards and "Alt" on other keyboards. <comment43997> It says 'Alt' on most modern Apple keyboards in fact, at least here in the UK/Ireland (and at least on laptop keyboards).
