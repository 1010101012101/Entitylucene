Keyboard shortcut to insert text - Keynote <body> I'm new to Keynote and am disappointed by the lack of shortcuts for basic actions like "insert text". Any idea of how to attribute a single key such as the letter "T" to insert text action?  If for any reason a single letter without cmd/opt/whatever modifier key is not recommended, I'm happy with other possibilities..  <answer210691> Have you tried adding keyboard shortcuts through System Preferences? See this article on the Apple Knowledge Base.  <answer210706> OS X does not allow mapping of single characters as Menu Shortcuts.  Apple has specific Human Interface Guidelines on the use of Keyboard shortcuts.  Although this document is for designing software meant to be used in the OS X environment, the principles they use may assist in understanding their reasoning.  At least one strongModifier/strong key must be used when generating shortcuts.  ul likbd⌃/kbd Control/li likbd⌥/kbd Option/li likbd⇧/kbd Shift (used only in conjunction with one of the other 3)/li likbd⌘/kbd Command ←  Preferred modifier/li /ul  <comment254269> I thought I did but I did not quite get correctly how to invoke the command I guess ! No I got this alright, although it seems impossible to bind a shortcut to a single key like "T", am I right ? <comment254276> Correct. Otherwise how would you type a "t" character? <comment254289> @bjbk Sure, if the shortcut were to work also when prompting text, that would be problematic. But when not in a prompting text environement, I don't see what would go wrong ? <comment254292> Do you use single keys in other software?  I know that in Presenter Mode, single keys are mapped for actions.  i.e.: "B" for blackout or "[" for next slide without animation.  But I have not seen this done while editing documents.  Modifier keys are used throughout the OS (even Windows uses them).  In fact, to type a capital letter, the Shift modifier key is always used.  So adding modifiers can be intuitive and useful. <comment254302> @bjbk VI for instance ? Also, inkscape for instance has single key shortcuts, emacs allows for modifier + letter + letter, which enhances considerably the number of possibilities, while not requiring to hit more than two keys at the same time (because, really, cmd+shift+opt+fn+W, how many fingers does ont need for this ?). Thanks for your answer below, I wish I could upvote. <comment254308> I agree.  Certainly would expand the use of the keyboard.  Thanks for your comment and the food for thought! Cheers!
