How does Mountain Lion set the default text editor for the "open -t" terminal command? <body> OSX seem to offer codeopen -t/code command line shortcut to open arbitrary files in the system default text editor.  ul liWhere is this default text editor set?/li liCan I change it from the command line (if possible) or otherwise programmatically?/li /ul  The default choice of TextEdit is limiting.  <answer73827> According to the open(1) man page:  code-t  Causes the file to be opened with the default text editor, as determined via LaunchServices/code  ol liTo change the associated editor, find a file with the extension you are trying to open in the Finder and select it./li liSelect File  Get Info from the menu bar./li liChange the "Open With" to your text editor of choice./li liPress the "Change Allâ€¦"/li /ol  Now your files with that extension should open in your selected text editor with "open -t " from the command line.  <answer73836> It's the default application for plain text (public.plain-text) files. You can change it from Finder's information panels or with duti.  You can also edit ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.launchservices.plist, but it requires restarting to apply the changes.  codedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.macromates.textmate;}'/code  <answer73837> You can also use codeopen -a &lt;application&gt; &lt;file&gt;/code to open a file from the Terminal in the editor of your choice, like so:  codeopen -a TextWrangler.app myfile.txt/code  To make this a bit shorter, I also have an alias in my code.profile/code file, like so:  codealias edit="open -a TextWrangler.app $1"/code  This allows me to just type:   codeedit myfile.txt/code   and the file will open in TextWrangler.   <comment85842> Do you know how to read the current value with defauls also? <comment86611> @MikkoOhtamaa `man defaults` will tell you how to do that, but basically `defaults read com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers` will tell you the default handler for all the file types. <comment86804> Default applications changed from Finder aren't added to com.apple.LaunchServices.plist. You can use `lsregister -dump` or [DefaultApplication](http://www.hamsoftengineering.com/codeSharing/defaultApplication/defaultApplication.html). (Or duti if you're just trying to avoid adding two entries to the plist.) <comment119444> Didn't work for me. <comment140706> Just a heads up, you can also achieve this by running  "Install Command Line Tools" from TextWrangler's application menu. It'll install an `edit` command, which does what your alias does, and in addition has a bunch of command line options. <comment141225> ^ it works perfectly instead of changing the default through command line! Thank you!
