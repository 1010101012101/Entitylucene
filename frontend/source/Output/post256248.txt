iPhone 4S OSX 7.1.2 Wifi switch greyed-out (disable) <body> Apple sent a replacement 4S last month: I have used the wifi w/o problems until today.  I have tried:  1) Rebooting the device several   2) Bouncing airplane mode  Questions:  A) Are there any settings (other than airplane mode) that will disable wifi?  B) Are there any diagnostic procedure that can ID root cause of wifi disabled?  <answer256261> If the Wifi switch is being displayed as greyed out that means that there is a hardware problem with the Wifi modem in the device. I had faced this with my device and Apple replaced it under warranty, I would suggest take the device to an Apple store and they should replace the device as you get 3 months support on replaced devices even if it was a paid replacement.  P.S: Rebooting, Resetting or any other changes can not fix this issue as it is a hardware issue, the earlier you go to the Apple support the better.  <comment319686> Confirmed it was a hardware problem with Apple
