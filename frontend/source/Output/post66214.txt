Are there any free and  lightweight spreadsheet programs for the Mac? <body> I'm looking for a free spreadsheet editor that is simple and lightweight. I don't want to install OpenOffice just to use a some spreadsheets every once in a while.  <answer66215> If Chrome isn't too heavy for you Google Docs has very capable spreadsheet facilities that improve all the time. You can even run it offline if you're going to be away from an internet connection.  <answer66259> If you just need to emview/em an Excel spreadsheet (code.xls/code or code.xlsx/code extension), you may be surprised to learn that Preview in Mountain Lion (and Lion, possibly?) can open and display them quite competently. You won't be able to edit anything, and I'm sure there may be problems with more advanced functions and macros and such, but if you just want to quickly view or print a spreadsheet, it may do the job.  Numbers, part of Apple's iWork suite, is neither free nor lightweight. But at US$20, it's quite affordable, particularly in proportion to the functionality it provides, and it certainly emfeels/em more lightweight than Open/LibreOffice.  <answer66280> There is gnumeric which is Gnomes's spreadsheet. It seems quick and lite. However it is designed for GNOME, one of the Unix desktops and does not look OSX like (note this is even using Cocoa GTK not X11)  Also you need to install on OSX from source. I used macports codesudo port install gnumeric/code which for Snow Leopard and Lion will install binaries. I suspect fink or homebrew will provide gnumeric as well.  <answer72202> I haven't used it, but pyspread looks promising:     Pyspread is a non-traditional spreadsheet application that is based on and written in the programming language Python.       The goal of pyspread is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.      Pyspread expects Python expressions in its grid cells, which makes a spreadsheet specific language obsolete. Each cell returns a Python object that can be accessed from other cells. These objects can represent anything including lists or matrices.   <answer93543> Try OpenOffice or LibreOffice; both have Mac versions as well as PC versions.   <answer124540> I have used Tables, which I can recommend.  The problem I found, however, is that successive versions of your sheet is not saved by Dropbox, because Tables saves its data in a proprietary format, as several files in a folder, and Dropbox will not save versions of folders, only files.  Thus, I couldn't restore previous saved sheets from Dropbox.  (I didn't check the behavior on Time Machine.)  If this doesn't bother you, however, it's a speedy and useful program for small jobs.  http://www.x-tables.eu/more/overview.html  <answer143804> the lack of a true mac native and lightweight spreadsheet has also bugged us for years, therefore we are developing a solution:  http://www.corecode.at/tableedit/index.html  note that later-on advanced features like graphs will probably be unlock-able cheap in-app purchases. we aim to have standard functionality free.  <comment77899> Do you need to be able to edit the spreadsheets or just read them? <comment77901> More difficult than one might think. From time to time I am also searching for a good spreadsheet program on OS X, but I haven't really found anything I could recommend. Here is a (very short) list of [free spreadsheet apps for OSX](http://alternativeto.net/software/microsoft-excel/?platform=mac&license=free). But going for Google Docs may be the best choice right now. <comment77904> wow, that is surprising. I'm using Gdocs already but every once in a while I need a standalone app, for example gdocs couldn't deal with one XLS that I had uploaded. <comment77908> If you don't mind compiling it yourself, you could try [Gnumeric](http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/) via e.g. [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) - but compilation/installation is for sure not lightweight, as you need to compile gtk+ and numerous other dependencies. But OS X integration is not much better than running the [Windows binary](http://people.gnome.org/~mortenw/gnumeric/gnumeric-1.10.16-20110616.exe) in [Wine](http://braumeister.org/formula/wine)... <comment109763> read the question, the OP doesn't want to use Open Office <comment122721> Note that according to the linked page about offline access, editing spreadsheets offline isn't available on any platform. <comment122723> QuickLook on Snow Leopard (at least, on my install) also works with common spreadsheets. While I have LibreOffice installed, the Office.qlgenerator looks to be from Apple (it has bundle ID "com.apple.qlgenerator.office" and is in /System/Library/QuickLook), so I expect it should work on any install of an appropriate version. There are reports online of being able to preview .doc and .docx in Leopard as well, so it's reasonable to expect it to work for spreadsheets. <comment358164> For what it's worth this is from the site: "Pyspread works on Linux and other GTK platforms as well as on Windows. While there have been reports that pyspread can be used on OS X as well, OS X is currently unsupported."
