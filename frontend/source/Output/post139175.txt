Transferring a single folder from a Time Machine to a different Mac <body> Recently, I purchased a new MacBook and I wanted to transfer files from the old one to the new one. I used Time Machine to back up all my files from the old Mac. Is it possible to retrieve not the entire disk, but a single file or a single folder from that back-up Time Machine to a new Mac?  <answer139192> Try this.      Connect the external drive that you use for Time Machine backups.Once   you enter Time Machine, you should see your saved backups in   chronological order. Scroll through your backups and look for specific   items or folders. Older dates are pink, newest copies are in white.      Use the Search field in the Time Machine Finder window to locate the   file or folder you wish to restore.      Use Quick Look to select what you need, and then press the spacebar to   view the file without having to launch its parent application.      Select the file or folder, and press the Restore button. The file will   automatically be copied to your desktop or to the fileâ€™s original   folder.   <answer139200> You can also copy the folder from Finder from code/Volumes/&lt;Time Machine volume name&gt;/Backups.backupdb/&lt;Mac name&gt;//code.  If your backup is on a network volume like a Time Capsule, open the sparse bundle file like code/Volumes/Data/Your Mac.sparsebundle//code first.  You can also run a command like codecp -a /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/Your\ Mac/2014-07-17-184058/HD/Users/username/folder ~/Desktop/code or codetmutil restore /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/Your\ Mac/2014-07-17-184058/HD/Users/username/folder ~/Desktop/code in a shell.  Finder and codetmutil restore/code remove extended attributes like codecom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot/code but codecp/code doesn't.  <comment164144> I would copy the contents over to an external HDD instead of using Time Machine for that.
