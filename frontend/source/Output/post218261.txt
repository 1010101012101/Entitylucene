Stop asking for iCloud password every time I log in <body> I'm not sure if this is related to a caching thing or a preference file or what. Also, I've removed the "?" from my dock but my system doesn't remember it when I shut down and restart, so I have to do it each time.  <comment263913> Two questions are here: what do you suppose the ? stands for, in this case?  One of the main apps Apple wants kept i the dock, perhaps? Or one that's checked in System Preferences, Users & Groups, Login Items (less likely.)                                                                   What this has to do with asking for iCloud password every login could be anything in the Cloud, iTunes or the App Store - anything - but can be set so as not to, each app or iCloud sharing in its own way. Hope this at least begins to help.
