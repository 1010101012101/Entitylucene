Is there any keyboard shortcut to switch my mouse cursor from one desktop to another? <body> I have connected my macBookPro multiples screens from left to right, 1,2,3,4,5...  Is there any keyboard shortcut to just move my cursor from monitor 1 to monitor 5 strongwithout me needing to drag my mouse all the way?/strong  Or possibly a keyboard shortcut that would also move my cursor to the new focused(I mean if I switch apps using Cmmd + Tab) app  <answer248083> There's no shortcut to my knowledge but if you are willing to get your hands a little dirty you can easily achieve this with a combination of 3rd party software, here is how I'd go about it:  ul liDownload and install MouseTools./li liDownload and install Keyboard Maestro./li liAdd KM Macro based on keys combination (to switch from one screen to another, one Macro for each display)./li liFinally for each macro add the Shell action with MouseTools -x xValue -y yValue (which are the coordinate on the display where you want the mouse to land)./li /ul  <comment306178> Thanks but not that dirty :) <comment306180> It's really easy, you can get the mouse position by running ```./MouseTool -location``` so do that when the mouse is at the centre of your display, repeat on the other one and use these values in the macros.
