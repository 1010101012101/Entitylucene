Where are open Finder windows saved between reboots <body> I have had several windows open in the Finder, serving as bookmarks for things I was working on, but recently they have all reverted to my home directory.    I would like to know where these open Finder windows are saved, so that I can look in a copy of that file from a backup, and either restore the file(s) or just retrieve the names from the file(s).  <comment362369> Are these remote or removable locations? A folder will revert to default if its location is removed. <comment362434> No, none of them were removable locations.  (I have no idea how or why they were reset to my home directory.)
