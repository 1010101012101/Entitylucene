keychaindump OS X 10.8.5 how to run it? <body> I am using OS X 10.8.5 and fairly new on Apple systems and especially running scripts.  Can anyone describe how to start Keychaindump, does it need to run thru Terminal, or i need a additional program for it? I admin the machine, but need a lost password on a other users account, is Admin enough to run the program or do i have to be Root? I have access to the other user account.  Some passwords on this account i can find as wifi's etc, but i try to access the master keychain pwd, because the login id been changed, and so far there was not yet a reset on the keychain pwd.  The program i downloaded as .zip but i just needs more information how to run the script, sorry this maybe a inconvenient newbie question for most users here, but anyway thx in advance for any information provided to get me running it.  Here the link to the developer https://github.com/juuso/keychaindump  <comment191416> I'm confused; what do you mean with "because the login id been changed, and so far there was not yet a reset on the keychain pwd "? <comment191420> @Asmus -The other user changed the login password for this account and didn't make yet a changing to the master keychain because forgot the previous pwd. So they wanna try retrieve the master key first instead making a new keychain and loosing all the connected pwd's with. <comment191423> The tool you linked to only allows extraction of data from logged-in users; which, usually, have an unlocked keychain by then. Since the other user changed their password, the system will no longer unlock the keychain during log-in, thus the tool should not be able to extract anything at all.
