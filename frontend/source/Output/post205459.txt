ZSH Slow - Calls sh and env multiple times on every command <body> My ZSH (tried both brew and included version) is slow. Even on calling simple ls command, it takes about 500ms to complete. And I noticed that on the title bar, it says codesh/code and codeenv/code couple of times before any command completes. I am using oh-my-zsh but zsh is slow even after I turn it off.  I don't know what data to provide so I'll post anything as required  PS: My SSH connections to AWS or GitHub are slow as well, didn't try any other ssh connections, but I am guessing they all will be slow as well. Is this a Mac Problem or is it only happening to me?  Thanks  <comment247734> What is your prompt? What happens if you just use zsh with no  startup files? <comment247958> Good call! It was rvm that was causing all the lag! But SSH is still slow
