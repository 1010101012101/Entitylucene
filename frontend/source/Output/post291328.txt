How to "killall" Visual Studio Code in Terminal? <body> I have a small shell script called "k" that i call everytime when i want to reset my complete Development Cycle:  precodekillall node killall Xcode killall Terminal /code/pre  How can i find out the final name of the "Visual Studio Code"-Prozess to kill it also this way?  I've tried:  precodekillall "Visual Studio Code" /code/pre     No matching processes belonging to you were found   precodekillall "Code" /code/pre     No matching processes belonging to you were found   Any ideas? I am looking for a generic approach without any manually lookup of PIDs necessary.
