Cmd+Tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows <body> When I want to switch between windows using Cmd+Tab it does not work with hidden or minimized windows. I can see the icons of these windows in the application switcher but choosing them does nothing. How can I get this to work again?  <answer112358> This one is a bit tricky :   ul lipress kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd + kbd⇥ Tab/kbd to show your running apps.

This will show the application's windows in Expose. Select the desired window with the arrow keys and press kbdReturn/kbd to activate it.  http://www.macworld.com/article/1152366/commandtabminimizedwindows.html  <answer207687> Try this:  On your Mac,  ol liNavigate to System Preferences/li liGo to Mission Control/li liUncheck "When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application"/li /ol  Try using the kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd now.  <answer276705> AppleScript   precodetell application "Slack" to reopen (activate) /code/pre  Or try my app Command-Tab Plus, in addition to proper  work with hidden or minimized apps has many convenient features that are not efficiently implemented in the built-in MacOs App's switcher   For example, there were discussed the problems of Mac Os X apps switcher   Restricting Command+tab options to only apps that are in the current space  Show only apps that are in the current space   <comment131929> Thank you, that worked. It's not very intuitive though. Is there a reason why it is necessary to press option to get the app back? <comment131957> I did not know this trick. A little difficult for the fingers. <comment133817> After playing, here are some notes. Contrary to what one could think, the Option trick does not show all windows in the target application. As long as the target app has at least one non-hidden window, the Option trick does nothing. Otherwise, when the target app has one or more hidden window(s), the Option trick shows **one**, and only one, of these windows. More interesting yet : with apps like the Terminal, or the Activity Monitor, the Option trick will create a new window. **In fact, Apple Tab with the Option trick is the equivalent of clicking the target app in the Dock.** <comment271226> Is there a way to make it "opposite"? <comment274330> this works only for  not minized windows <comment326451> Found this more recent article useful and on point for this question.  http://www.macworld.com/article/2048857/10-tips-for-managing-minimized-windows.html <comment361524> this is true however I fail to see the benefit of apple's approach to not auto show a minimized app's window when the app is selected using command+tab ... linux window managers just do what's most natural ... time to short apple stock <comment361525> would be nice if osx could be configured to behave properly here ... osx is falling behind linux more every day
