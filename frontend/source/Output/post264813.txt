How to change user name? <body> I am rookie in mac and first time when I got mac I set user name as Admin therefore all that associate with the mac begin with name Admin.  I would like to change this name to Aleksey  I found in System Preferences tab where it could be changed  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9C2j.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I am not sure that if I change name I will not get errors in consequences , because as far as I understand such way I will change path.  Eventually I am not sure that path will be changed in all apps where it has been taken  If my explanation not clear feel free to ask  Thanks in advance!  <answer264815> If you have sufficient space on your drive to duplicate your user account temporarily…  ol liCopy your home folder /Users/old-username to /Users/new-username.  precodesudo cp -a /Users/old-username /Users/new-username /code/pre/li liCreate a new user account in Users &amp; Groups.

It might be a good idea anyway though. <comment332264> @j-beda I've done this procedure a few times and I've had odd permission problems happen with third-party apps, so I just recommend it anyway, also see the other questions on this site where people have changed username and my answer suggesting resetpassword solving the problem. <comment332418> @grgaside, probably good advice for the duplication instructions too.
