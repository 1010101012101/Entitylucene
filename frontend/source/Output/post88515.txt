How do I edit current shell command in VI <body> I have seen in blogs on Linux machines you can edit the current bash shell command in VI (or whatever the EDITOR is set to) by pressing ctrl-x,ctrl-e.  This doesn't seem to work on 10.8.  Any ideas on how to edit the current bash command in the default editor?  <answer88528> You want codeset -o vi/code (add it to your code~/.bashrc/code). Then, to edit the current line, just hit kbdEsc/kbd to enter command mode.  See http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Readline-vi-Mode  To edit the current command in a full-screen editor, set your codeVISUAL/code environment variable to codevim/code (I assume you want codevim/code), then in command mode in the current comment, hit kbdv/kbd.  <answer220145> Your codeedit-and-execute-command/code may not be bound for codevi/code mode. Try:  codebind -m vi-insert '"\C-x\C-e": edit-and-execute-command'/code  To make it permanent, add that line to your code~/.inputrc/code file.

Did you try to unset FCEDIT and EDITOR? <comment103643> The documentation for C-xC-e is [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#index-operate_002dand_002dget_002dnext-_0028C_002do_0029) -- what's in your `VISUAL` variable? <comment103655> it is not about 10.8. I am on 10.8 and it works fine with me. I did not change anything in my .bash_profile to enable this. <comment105558> pressing the "v" was the secret sauce I was missing.  thanks. <comment195157> Note: This Apple.SE question is basically the same as the Super User question ["I'm using Bash in 'vi mode'. What's the hotkey sequence to edit the current command line using an external editor?"](http://superuser.com/questions/736368/im-using-bash-in-vi-mode-whats-the-hotkey-sequence-to-edit-the-current-comm) <comment257365> Is it possible to get this `v` command while in emacs (non-vi) mode? <comment297317> Just do Ctrl-X then Ctrl-E.
