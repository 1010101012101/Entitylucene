How do I install the Android wear app on an iPhone, sans watch. Just use Google Fit <body> A senior close relative of mine wants to use the Google fit facilities and web page to keep track of his walks and sporadic /opportunistic exercise. He can't be bothered to remember and manually "start"  and "end" activities, so the Google fit app on his phone would be an ideal match.   However, his handset of choice is an iPhone. Naturally, this Britney a strategic area where iOS and Android compete, there is no Google Fit app for iOS, except for the webview attached to the iOS Google search app. Needless to say,  no activity recording takes place.   So,  I read that it was possible to get the iPhone to feed telemetry and sensor data from an iPhone into the Google Mother ship by installing then Android wear app on then iPhone. This app collects most of the data I'm interested in, namely activity recognition and steps/distance walked.   My question is, (of course its possible) How can I "trick" the setup procedure on the iPhones "Android wear app" without a wear device? Once active, the data I want will be collected and uploaded from the handset.   Has anyone done something similar?  Is there another approach to have the iPhone send data and telemetry to the Google fit service?   I thought perhaps a wear simulator, on my dev workstation could do the trick...  Ideas?
