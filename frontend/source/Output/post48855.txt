Open Terminal.app with directory from a given URL? <body> With the URL code&lt;file:///Library/Fonts&gt;/code (for example in a note in NV) I can open the finder with the given location. Can I do something similar for the terminal? That is, if I write for example (doesn't work, that is the question!) code&lt;terminal://Library/Fonts&gt;/code the Terminal.app should open a new window and cd to that directory.  <answer48895> This works from the command line:  precode/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal /Users/ &amp; /code/pre  Where /Users/ is the directory you want to set the working directory to.  <answer48940> Try the codeopen/code command:  ul licodeopen ./code opens Finder window for current directory/li licodeopen /Library/Fonts/code opens Finder window for code/Library/Fonts/code/li licodeopen http://www.apple.com//code/li licodeopen ~/Documents/my-big-novel.pages/code/li /ul  Run codeman open/code for additional options.  <answer56880> h2Opening a New Terminal Interactively/h2  As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal has a “New Terminal at Folder” Service you can enable in:  strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Services  Files and Folders/strong  With this Service you can open a new terminal by selecting a folder or file path in any application and choosing this Service in the contextual menu (Control-Click or Right-Click) or the Services submenu in the application menu.  It doesn’t support “file:” URLs, but you can select the path part of the URL “/Library/Fonts” and use the Service with that.  There is also a “New Terminal Tab at Folder” Service.  h2Opening a New Terminal Programmatically/h2  If you need to open it from a command line or shell script, you can use the codeopen/code command to tell Terminal to open a directory pathname or “file:” URL:  precodeopen -a Terminal file:///Library/Fonts /code/pre  (This is equivalent to dragging a folder, file path or “file:” URL onto the Terminal application, which opens a new Terminal at that location.)  <comment55955> I don't see how I could turn this into a URL?! <comment55957> Not without writing your own URL handler. I strongly recommend against it as it opens quite a security hole (unless you are really careful and know what you are doing). <comment55958> The term you're looking for is a "protocol handler". It looks like you might be able to achieve what you want with a bit of AppleScript to wrap Terminal.app; see [this Apple Discussion thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1280989?start=0&tstart=0). <comment55961> Thanks to you both. While I don't mind writing code I'll put this on hold for a while. I was silently hoping for a out of the box solution. If one of you put your comment into an answer I'd be happy to mark that as accepted. <comment55981> Sorry, I misread what you were trying to do.  You'd have to register a URL handler somehow.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/595481/register-a-protocol-on-mac-osx  Looks like Terminal supports ssh, telnet, and x-man-page, but nothing else right now. <comment65315> “if I write” If you write it where? In a text file? In a shell script? At the command line? <comment65468> @ChrisPage for example on the `open` command line: `open file:///foo/bar` or (as I wish) `open terminal://Library/Fonts` <comment65689> See "Opening a New Terminal Programmatically" in my answer.
