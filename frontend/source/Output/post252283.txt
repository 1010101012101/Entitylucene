no texting without a sim card? <body> my iPhone 6 plus doesn't have a sim card in it and i can't get it to let me text people without it and I've read other peoples questions and they said its possible to text without one but mine won't let me. can someone help please?  <comment313870> Texting usually means SMS messaging which has to go over a phone connection which needs a SIM. Perhaps the others meant messaging - ask them what app they use to do this or if questions here please provide links to them <comment313874> iMessage should work to other iPhones (when your text bubbles turn blue).  As @Mark points out SMS messages (green text bubbles) require a SIM card.   There are also apps like Text Free or Google Hangouts and others where a phone number will be assigned for traditional texting. <comment313911> You require a sim to text, but you should be able to use iMessage, as long as you've activated the phone?
