What other apps have secret debug menus? <body> I'm aware that Reminders, Disk Utility, and App Store have debug menus. Are there any other apps that have a similar Terminal command for a secret debug menu?  <answer280904> ul liReminders  precodedefaults write com.apple.reminders RemindersDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre/li liDisk Utility  precodedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled -bool true /code/pre/li liApp Store  precodedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre/li liSafari (not to be confused with Develop menu which can be enabled in Preferences)  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQe6C.png" width="304"/li liiCal  precodedefaults write com.apple.iCal IncludeDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre/li liContacts  precodedefaults write com.apple.Contacts ABShowDebugMenu -bool YES /code/pre/li /ul  <comment353353> iCal, not to be confused with the newer version Calendar? Or is it still called iCal in the hardware? <comment353354> @DonielF The preferences are still called iCal, but I’ve called the app iCal too because it doesn’t seem to be available since the rename to Calendar and the app was changed substantially. <comment353357> Ah. I see it's discussed [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/58889/234283).
