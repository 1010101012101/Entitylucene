MacBook SSD filled with 90% "Other" <body> The MacBook of my mom didn't have enough space on its SSD so that it's unable to install a new version of OX X. Looking at what is filling up the ssd it clearly shows that around 90% is taken up by "Other". The thing is that i ran out of ideas what those files could be since i want to delete some too few up space.  What files does OS X group as "Other" and is this potentially a bug that "Other" is taking up so much space?  <comment343162> Unlike on iOS, the Mac offers an easy way to find out what's occupying their storage: just wade in and start looking at files! I'd recommend "Get Info..." (âŒ˜+i) on her Users directory; if that's large, do the same on each subdirectory; and so on until you start finding where your space is going. Alternately, the answer that @Tetsujin linked mentions some apps that can help break down drive usage.
