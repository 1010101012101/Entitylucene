Photos.app creates blank images after importing iPhoto library <body> I imported a not very large (40 GB) iPhoto library into the new Photos app. Photos created a bunch of white images when importing some photos in that library:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/URM4R.jpg" alt="Photos.app blank image thumbnails after import"  The metadata on these blank photos matches the photo next to it, I can tell that it is supposed to be a duplicate.   ul liI ran the repair database option in iPhoto before importing, and it didn't find any photos in the iPhoto folder that weren't in the database. So a bad iPhoto library shouldn't be the issue. /li liI also tried repairing the Photos.app library. While that got rid of many blank photos, it didn't remove all of them./li /ul  Searched all over but couldn't find anyone else who had this.  What is a good way to get rid of these? They're harmless but super annoying  <answer217972> I have the same problem. It turned out that the photos were gone, recovery had to come from a backup.  You can check if you have the same problem by right-clicking a white photo. Then copy the photo name. Then open a terminal and execute the following commands: codecd ~/Pictures; find . -iname &lt;photo name&gt;/code. If nothing is found, you'll know the photo is gone :(  <answer218334> Turns out these blank photos also fail to upload to iCloud Photo Library. Make a smart album to find them efficiently:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jvfi9.png" alt="photos app smart album for failed to upload"  Then go into the album and delete all the photos (don't forget to hold Cmd!)  <comment263851> Hm, I don't think that's quite the same problem. The metadata here shows the blanks are duplicate pointers to the same photo. In your case, they were blank because the photos were actually gone.
