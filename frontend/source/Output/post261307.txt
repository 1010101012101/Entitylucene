MacBookPro freezes in lock screen when waking up after sleep in Sierra <body> After updating my MacBookPro to macOS Sierra, the display sometimes freezes in the emlock screen/em, when waking up from sleep. I have to wait for a few seconds before the Mac allows me to insert my password and unlock it.  Does anyone know how to solve this issue?  <answer263835> I have the same problem (among a lot of other ones with Sierra) but the Apple Support agent I had on the phone told me I was the first to report this and advised me to bring my computer to a store to check my hardware (keyboard)..!  They obviously don't know...  <comment330631> Mine actually crashes, forcing the computer to reboot. Did you take it to a store? <comment330638> No, I was wondering if there were a more immediate solution for fixing this issue.
