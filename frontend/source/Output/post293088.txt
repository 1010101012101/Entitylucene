FileVault personal recovery key <body> How is PRK generated/derived and what is being sent to Apple's servers if I choose "use this iCloud account to unlock and reset your password..." during FileVault setup? I wasn't able to find this in FileVault technical whitepaper. Is it just yet another DEK (Data Encryption Key)?  <answer293092> The personal recovery key is read from /dev/random and base32 encoded afterwards:     ... When activating FileVault 2, the   System Preferences application displays a randomly generated   120 bit password, encoded with base32, to the end   user and advises them to securely store the password for   recovery (see figure 2). The recovery password is read   from /dev/random (through libcsfde and SecCreateRecoveryPassword()   in Security.framework).

Is it just a randomly generated DEK? <comment369770> It depends how you expand DEK! This can be seen in page 8, figure 8. It's one of several possible "keys" for key derivation. It's **no** DataEK but a DerivedEK. <comment369771> What does DEK stand for? Data or Derived Encryption Key? <comment369772> That's the only thing sent to Apple's servers, right? <comment369773> @assp1r1n3 I never checked the content of the IP-packets but I assume it's the only thing sent to iCloud but encrypted again (probably with some temp key).
