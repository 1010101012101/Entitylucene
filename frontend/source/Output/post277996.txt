How can I remove an iCloud account with a disabled preference pane? <body> How can I sign out of iCloud when my administer has restricted my account from using the iCloud preference pane in System Preferences?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5tPho.png" alt="disabled System Preferences"  strongBackground/strong: I signed in to iCloud on the Mac. Then, my IT department put in place restrictions on my Mac, preventing me from opening the iCloud preference pane. Everything was working fine, even with this restriction, until I enabled Apple's two-factor authentication. Now my IT department is telling me they don't want us to connect our personal iCloud accounts on company machines, but I can't sign out of my account because I can't open the prefpane.  strongInfo/strong  OS: OS X Yosemite 10.10.5  Model: iMac (27-inch, Late 2012)
