Mac showing Thunderbolt Ethernet as Airport <body> My network interfaces are showing different names to others that I have seen and I believe it may be causing an issue when setting up a virtual box.  Isn't Airport the other name for the Wifi? This shows it as the ethernet port.  Has anyone seen this issue before? I think it may have happened because I installed Android File Transfer or plugged in my Galaxy S4.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Shh5V.png" alt="Mac network settings"  <answer138504> Are you sure someone isn't playing a joke on you?  Just rename the service. emClick the âš™ icon.../em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ELAkT.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then rename the server. You can call "Thunderbolt Ethernet" something like "Wi-Fi", "Yo Mama" or anything you wish. You'll also want to change the name of the inactive "Wi-Fi" entry to "Thunderbolt Ethernet". Your software seems to have switched the interface names.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eL4Lt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment163433> This is spot on.  I've seen this happen many, many, times.  You can either rename the interface or remove them and re-add them.
