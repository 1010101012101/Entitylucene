Apple's RAID-1 with FileVault encryption <body> as far as I understand is it currently not possible to use Apple's disk utilities to create a RAID-1 system with 2 USB devices, while encrypting the entire devices by default.   So, one possibility would simply be to create a image that is (almost) as large as the USB devices.   Would such a solution work in terms of speed and practicability? Would small modifications in the image require the entire re-encryption of the image? Asked the other way: Would small changes only affect small parts of the image (and therefore also of the USB devices) or would it completely re-write the cipher, thereby essentially re-writing the entire content of the USB devices? In that case, I could imagine that my idea would be far from practical, both regarding time .  Would my solution work or are there any other practical solutions?  I hope, I could more or less precisely specify my question. Summing up again, I would like to rely on Apple's standard tools to build an encrypted RAID-1 system on 2 USB devices.  Thank you very much.
