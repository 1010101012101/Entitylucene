How do I batch set the files "date modified" to the "date created"? <body> I have a folder with a bunch of photos taken by two different cameras, with one camera having been set to the wrong date. I managed to correct the EXIF date using Picasa (see photo.stackexchange), but apparently, it only adjusts the "Date Created" of the file, and not the "Date modified".  How can I make the "Date modified" (shown by default in the Finder) equal to the "Date Created" for a bunch of files?  I've looked in the codetouch/code terminal command, but couldn't find an answer there for my specific issue.  <answer59407> Assuming JPG files:  precodefor f in *.jpg; do    olddate=$(stat -f %SB -t %Y%m%d%H%M "$f")    touch -m -t $olddate "$f"     done /code/pre  For other suffixes just adjust the pattern in the codefor/code statement accordingly.  <comment68443> Put it in an `sh` script, and worked perfectly for me. Thanks! <comment68444> Closely related to http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/57648/9058 actually
