When erasing media in Disk Utility, how can I change the default format? <body> Every time I erase my MicroSD card, I need to change the format from codeExFAT/code to codeMS-DOS (FAT)/code. Is there a way to change the default to the latter, or better yet, to default to the current format of the drive I'm erasing?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4IYw1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer221488> There isn't a setting to change, so you might instead script the codediskutil/code command to do the erase using AppleScript or another scripting language.  precodediskutil eraseVolume disk12345 /code/pre  The codeeraseVolume/code command just wipes the volume and recreates an empty filesystem to match what was there. You could build a little window to ask for the volume or perhaps even list all the disks and then tell you to insert the drive to be wiped.  You also might use codesystem_profiler SPCardReaderDataType/code or the similar strongSPStorageDataType/strong or strongSPUSBDataType/strong depending on how the cards you wish to erase are connected to the Mac.
