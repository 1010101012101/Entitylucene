How to change Home / End behaviour on Yosemite <body> I want to change the kbdHome/kbd and kbdEnd/kbd keys to work like Windows/Linux.   CHANGE:  kbdHome/kbd to kbdCommand/kbd-kbdLeft Arrow/kbd.   // Beginning of the line  kbdEnd/kbd to kbdCmd/kbd-kbdRight Arrow/kbd.  // End of the line  I tried using Karabiner app known as KeyRemap4MacBook. But it doesn't work on Yosemite while I write code on editors like Sublime Text, PhpStorm, WebStorm, etc.   I also did create a codeDefaultKeyBindings.dict/code file (with proper settings) inside code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and codeOSX/Library/KeyBindings//code.  So, is there a way to remap the kbdHome/kbd and kbdEnd/kbd keys for glabally on my mac. I could use Terminal command too. I don't want an app for that.  <answer190013> You might have to change the custom settings in the Terminal app. But it's quite straight forward. See here: http://fdiv.net/2007/05/12/keybindings-in-macosx-terminal-app  I also changed it for my Sublime Text 2:  precode   { "keys": ["home"], "command": "move_to", "args": {"to": "bol"} },    { "keys": ["end"], "command": "move_to", "args": {"to": "eol"} }, /code/pre  <answer206348> It is possible to achieve this behavior using Karabiner. I know you  tried already, but please read. I use it extensively on Yosemite (10.10.2)  Optional (can't remember if is 100% necessary), but follow just in case:  ul liAdd codeKarabiner_AXNotifier.app/code on codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy (tab or horizontal menu on top) &gt; Accessibility (left column)/code/li /ul  Then:  ol liOpen Karabiner codePreferences/code and go to the codeMisc &amp; Uninstall/code tab./li liClick the codeOpen private.xml/code button (under codeCustom Settings/code)/li liAdd this content to codeprivate.xml/code (create the file if it doesn't exists):/li /ol  pre code &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;Fix Home/End System-wide&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;appendix&gt;(Home/End move to beg/end of line, Ctl/Cmd+Home/End move to beg/end of page)&lt;/appendix&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;remap.all_apps_fix_home_end&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ FROMKEYCODE_HOME, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_COMMAND, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP,   ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ FROMKEYCODE_HOME, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP,   ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ FROMKEYCODE_END,  MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_COMMAND, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ FROMKEYCODE_END,  MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;        &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ FROMKEYCODE_HOME, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ FROMKEYCODE_END, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code /pre  ol start="4" liReturn to the codeChange Key/code tab./li liClick the codeReload XML/code button./li liSearch for codeSystem-wide/code in the search box and check the codeFix Home/End System-wide/code (I named it this way to make it easier for you to activate)/li liTry the Home/End keys./li /ol  <comment207188> So i've done it. Do you know the answer? <comment207189> Did you try creating the KeyBindings folder? It may not be present by default. <comment207190> I did that. And i already wrote it in the question. <comment207192> Your question does not make that clear. It sounds like you tried to do it, but stopped because that folder was not present. <comment207194> Ok, edited. Do you know the answer? <comment207198> It is Cmd on MacbookPro and Mac Pro. And i believe the rest is the same. But the problem is not changing Fn behaviour. I am trying to change HOME / END keys. <comment207215> Don't smash your Mac - do edit your post again to explain what "editors" means. Are you in vi, Xcode, Textmate? Be specific with versions if possible. <comment207357> OK, I edited the problem. How do people change or customize their macs? Do we have to use what Apple thought for us? <comment225540> Thanks for the answer. But i have switched to brackets.  I needed some command for OS level. But thanks to Apple it is not possible.  Thanks anyway. <comment248773> Thanks. I will try when i get to office after 10 days. I don't have full keyboard currently. <comment248835> But... But... What about the bounty?... J/k. After answering I found this solution (also using karabiner) which saves you some hassle: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/63972/71410 <comment248933> The solution you found is from OS X Lion. Yosemite is very different. I open bounty again and give you if it is working. Sorry i am agnostic. <comment253832> Just for you to now, this is not working. Copy paste cat.
