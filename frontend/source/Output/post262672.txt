Possibility of powering internal display with eGPU <body> In the last iteration of Apple's Mac OS X, (OS X 10.11) using an eGPU only worked if you have an external display to power or if you were using it as a render engine. A while ago, during MacOS 10.12 Sierra Beta, MacVidCards posted that Sierra had better eGPU support (i.e. no extra system modifications required). With macOS Sierra can an eGPU drive the internal display?  Clarification: I am asking for a friend who wants to use an eGPU but does not have an external monitor to use it with. Said friend wants to use it mainly for games, but hopes it will help with video editing speeds as well.  Any questions, comments, answers, opinions, or suggested solutions other than an eGPU would be welcome.  Thanks!
