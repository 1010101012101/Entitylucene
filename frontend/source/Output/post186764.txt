Image border in Preview app <body> Whenever I have a sprite frame, and I open it in Preview app, I can't see the exact edges of the image because the background of an image is transparent. Therefore, I can't see if there is any padding around it. Is it possible to turn on image borders in Preview app?  <answer186770> You can toggle "Show Image Background" in "View" menu (kbd⌥ alt/kbd+kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbdB/kbd). This will produce "chess" pattern instead of the clear color. Example (I've set white color around this rectangle to be transparent):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9vbK7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment220705> That's it :) Thanks :)
