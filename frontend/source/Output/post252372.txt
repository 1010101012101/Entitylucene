OSX : Script to get foremost window details keeps on giving detail of the minimized window <body> I am trying to get active window details ( app name, process id and window title ) of the foremost window through the applescript given below :  precodeglobal windowTitle,browserTabUrl,appName,appID  set windowTitle to "" set currentTabTitle to ""  tell application "System Events"    set frontApp to first application process whose frontmost is true   set appName to name of frontApp   set x to first process whose its frontmost is true   set appID to unix id of x    tell process appName     try        tell (1st window whose value of attribute "AXMain" is true)            set windowTitle to value of attribute "AXTitle"        end tell     end try       end tell  end tell  return {windowTitle,appName,appID} /code/pre  The script works great ( returns correct app name and window title ) apart from just one issue wherein strongwhen i minimise the currently focussed active window, then also it keeps giving the details the minimised window./strong  For eg: Say I strongopen Chrome browser/strong then the script gives me output  precodeActive Window Details :  Google Chrome, 829 /code/pre  But strongwhen i minimize the chrome browser and some other window ( say skype ) is shown in the background/strong then  Then also the script gives me output  precodeActive Window Details :  Google Chrome, 829 /code/pre  strongQuery : Is there any way by which we can get correct foremost window even after the active window is minimised ??/strong  strongOther Details:/strong  ul liI am trying to run this script from nodejs.
