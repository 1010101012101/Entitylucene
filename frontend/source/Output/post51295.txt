Failed to launch iTerm2 <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   iTerm2 terminals close immediately with &ldquo;argpath=login error=No such file or directory&rdquo;       iTerm2 is immediately closed after launch with the error:  precode"argpath=login error=No such file or directory" /code/pre  If I switch from login to command (with bash -l) I'm getting the following error:   precode"argpath=bash error=No such file or directory" /code/pre  I'm running OSX Lion.  How this can be fixed?  <answer51296> Looks like there is some problem with reading whatever iTerm2 reads as a login shell.  Try changing the preference in 'Profiles/General' to a specific command (i.e. code/bin/bash/code) and see if that works.  Additionally, does Apple's terminal work?  could you do something like  precodeecho $SHELL bash /code/pre  and see if bash actually exists on your machine?  Bash is quite unfussed on what login items you have, so make sure you have a minimal .bash_profile and .bashrc in your $HOME  Give it a try and let's see if we get enough info to help you.  <comment58638> I have this in my .bashrc: $ cat .bashrc export TERM=xterm-256color <comment58639> also look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6788402/error-opening-terminal-xterm-256color <comment58640> and at: http://superuser.com/questions/327791/terminal-strangeness-after-installing-xcode-on-lion <comment58643> It seems that /bin is no longer in my path so the command should be /bin/bash instead of bin. How can I fix this?
