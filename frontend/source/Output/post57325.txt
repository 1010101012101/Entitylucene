Detect installed applications (software dev) on OS X Lion <body> I'm a first time Mac user.   Aside from checking out the installed applications on my Applications folder, are there other ways to find out what applications have been installed on my OS X Lion?  When I tried out the Terminal, and then assumed that the IRB (Interactive Ruby) or Ruby was installed, so I typed "irb" and it did work.  It ran the Interactive Ruby and I was typing simple Ruby commands then!  I tried typing "python" too and the Python prompt then appeared.  I typed some basic Python commands like "print 'hello world'" and it worked too!  I was thinking if there was a way to find out just like the Add/Remove Programs that I was used to when I was still using Windows XP/7 back then.  Cheers!  <answer57481> You can search for executable files with codemdfind 'kMDItemContentType==public.unix-executable'/code. It seems to exclude files inside application bundles and files with a filename extension though.  codemdfind 'kMDItemContentType==com.apple.application-bundle'/code would search for application bundles.  <answer57487> Apple Menu  About This Mac   In the resulting window: (More Info)  In the side bar of the resulting window: Software  Applications  Columns presented:  Application Name | Version | Last Modified  Click on a row to see more details:  ul liKind (architecture)/li li64 Bit/li liApp Store/li liGet Info String/li liLocation (in the file system)/li /ul  I see Python this way (3 different versions actually) but not PHP or Ruby.  <comment65826> I wanted to find out what programs or tools that were installed in my OS X Lion, especially ones that are related to web development?  I was asking myself this questions: "This this already have Apache installed or not?", "Is MySQL already installed here", "What about Ruby?".  I was assuming these questions because of my experience on some Linux installations were these tools are bundled with the installation of the OS. <comment65827> I don't miss "Add Remove Programs" at all, but sometimes I miss having the kind of overview you are after. There's nothing wrong with listing the contents of `/bin` and `/usr/bin` just to get a quick peek at what in on your path. Sqlite is there. <comment65828> Apache is there.  You can enable it in `System Preferences- Sharing - Web Sharing`. <comment65829> You may also find that some of the programs Apple packages with the OS are a bit outdated.  I'm going to start the *MacPorts vs. HomeBrew* shout-outs with **MacPorts** as my pref.  These two can provide you with access to more and more current packages. <comment65845> Is there a way we can determine the versions of this installed programs? <comment65863> Many unix programs tak --version as an argument - also not all Linuxes bundle MySql and ruby <comment65889> @Panoy, if you are worried about versions already you may want to look into MacPorts, Fink, or HomeBrew.  MacPorts has many recent packages available. <comment66061> I think I have ruby installed as I'm playing with the Interactive Ruby on the Terminal but it didn't show up with I've done the procedure you're talking about.  Hmmm, I might check up again just to make sure.
