How much space for Macintosh HD backup? <body> I'm thinking about having a 250 GB pen drive for Macintosh HD backup. Would this be enough according to this chart?  Seems I'm using just 150 GB but Apps storage says is using 315 GB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCgMn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment301758> Wow, that isâ€”weird.
