"Root" users and unknown stuff eating up my CPU space <body> Opened the Activity Monitor and discovered many of the software such as "Alipay dispatcher service" that I have deleted like two years ago is constantly running on the back end of my Mac every second I'm using my Mac, same goes for many unknown softwares like "powerd" "mdflagwriter" "watchdogd" "socketfilterfw", etc, etc, countless.  What could I do to stop them from preying my privacy and constantly running on the back end of my mac and using my CPU space?  I tried the code   precodesudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist /code/pre  but the Terminal says  "Could not find specified service" Then I entered the code "/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist" but the system replies "Permission denied".  What could I do to delete this "dispatcher service" once and for all?  Same for all the "root users" software?  <answer280427> To inactivate, disable or remove the Alipay services several tools/methods are available in the Internet.   One method to disable it seems to be:  precodesudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist  sudo launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.alipay.refresher.plist /code/pre  The preferred method though is to remove all Alipay files and folders:  Booted to Save Mode or Recovery Mode remove the following files if present:  precode$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.alipay.adaptor.plist $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.alipay.refresher.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/com.alipay.adaptor.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/com.alipay.refresher.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist /Library/Application Support/Alipay/AlipayDispatcherService /Library/Application Support/Alipay/AlipayDispatcherService.sig /code/pre  $HOME denotes your user folder in /Users.  hr  One inactivator - after desinfecting your Mac is an AppleScript available here: AlipayDispatcherInactivator-OSX  You can either download the scpt file or open Script Editor.app and enter the following snippet, compile and run it.  precodetry     display dialog "敝脚本会将 AlipayDispatcherService 服务彻底灭活、使其无法继续在后台妨害 OS X 系统介面的视讯效能。其原理就是在该服务尚未加载的前提下、以管理员权限将相关档案全部消灭为 0 byte 的空壳档案、并将权限均设定为「root:wheel 444」（防止写入）。  请在以安全模式开机的前提下执行该脚本，否则可能会导致灭活失败。至于如何以「安全模式」开机，请参考 Apple 相关的官方文章：https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT201262  为应对相关档案卷土重来之可能性，您可能需要在每次使用支付宝之后均重新执行该灭活脚本。请今后在安装、使用支付宝的时候不要再出让任何管理员权限。  如果您此时放弃对此灭活的想法的话，现在取消还来得及、相关按钮就在下方。" with title "AlipayDispatcherService 灭活脚本"      do shell script "cd $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/ &amp;&amp; touch com.alipay.adaptor.plist &amp;&amp; chown root:wheel com.alipay.adaptor.plist &amp;&amp; chmod 444 com.alipay.adaptor.plist" with administrator privileges     do shell script "cd $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/ &amp;&amp; touch com.alipay.refresher.plist &amp;&amp; chown root:wheel com.alipay.refresher.plist &amp;&amp; chmod 444 com.alipay.refresher.plist" with administrator privileges     do shell script "cd /Library/LaunchAgents/ &amp;&amp; touch com.alipay.adaptor.plist &amp;&amp; chown root:wheel com.alipay.adaptor.plist &amp;&amp; chmod 444 com.alipay.adaptor.plist" with administrator privileges     do shell script "cd /Library/LaunchAgents/ &amp;&amp; touch com.alipay.refresher.plist &amp;&amp; chown root:wheel com.alipay.refresher.plist &amp;&amp; chmod 444 com.alipay.refresher.plist" with administrator privileges     do shell script "cd /Library/LaunchDaemons/ &amp;&amp; touch com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist &amp;&amp; chown root:wheel com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist &amp;&amp; chmod 444 com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist" with administrator privileges     do shell script "cd '/Library/Application Support/Alipay/' &amp;&amp; touch AlipayDispatcherService &amp;&amp; chown root:wheel AlipayDispatcherService &amp;&amp; chmod 444 AlipayDispatcherService" with administrator privileges     do shell script "cd '/Library/Application Support/Alipay/' &amp;&amp; touch AlipayDispatcherService.sig &amp;&amp; chown root:wheel AlipayDispatcherService.sig &amp;&amp; chmod 444 AlipayDispatcherService.sig" with administrator privileges     display notification "灭活成功。" with title "AlipayDispatcherService 灭活脚本"  on error     display notification "灭活步骤已被取消，相关档案尚未更动。" with title "AlipayDispatcherService 灭活脚本" end try /code/pre  <answer280455> I can't speak to something called "Alipay', but the rest of those are part of the OS, and you have no reason to stop them.  <comment352730> `sudo launchctl unload /library/launchDaemons/com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist` won't work because the command is case-sensitive: use `sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.alipay.DispatcherService.plist` instead. <comment352736> Seeing the root user in Activity Monitor is normal. Many, if not all, of the processes running under root are essential system services and should not be tampered with, unless you know what you are doing. If you are seeing huge CPU cycles expended by `powerd` then you should [reset the SMC](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295). `mdflagwriter`, `watchdogd` and `socketfilterfw` are processes that deal with Spotlight indexing, system crash reporting and the built-in macOS firewall respectively. Googling the name of a process brings up very useful troubleshooting information. <comment352738> @klanomath it still says could not find specified service <comment352739> right, so Im most concerned about the Alipay dispatcher service, cuz I haven't used their products for like two years and have long deleted it, but their software is constantly running on the back end is just not right.... <comment352752> just upon entering the first line "cd $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/ && touch com.alipay.adaptor.plist && chown root:wheel com.alipay.adaptor.plist && chmod 444 com.alipay.adaptor.plist"     the terminal responds "Operation not permitted"
