Where are currently set wallpapers stored in Mountain Lion? <body> I have set a wallpaper to my desktop, now I want to consolidate all my wallpapers into a single folder so the system can cycle through them.  How can I find a currently set wallpaper's location?  <answer60432> Have a look at this hint: http://osxdaily.com/2011/11/20/show-the-location-path-of-current-wallpaper-in-mac-os-x/  You can (temporarily) show the location of the current desktop picture by executing the following command from the Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock desktop-picture-show-debug-text -bool TRUE;killall Dock /code/pre  You can revert this behavior by executing the following:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock desktop-picture-show-debug-text;killall Dock /code/pre  <comment69555> How have you set it? System wallpapers are in `/Library/Desktop Pictures`. <comment82658> Thanks a lot for this hint. I was looking for this since I just found the addtional Wallpapers ment for Retina display in the System somewhere and wanted to copy them over to the regular folder for the backgr pics. Thanks again Manfredo/Hamburg(Germany) <comment88568> Unfortunately, that reset my wallpaper to another random one in the collection, defeating the purpose :( Although it did show the location of the new wallpaper ;) <comment114879> One thing to note in the links and the above answer (which is good) is that you don't want to do CMD+Shift+G and then select enter ~/Library/Desktop Pictures - as this will take to you the Library folder under your User in the mac. You want to go to a different library - directly off of your hard drive at the root level - that's where this is located.
