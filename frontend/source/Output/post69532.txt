Safari won't enter fullscreen <body> I'm currently running Safari 5.1.4 on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3, and after bringing it out of the fullscreen mode, I quit safari using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd.   When I restarted my Mac, for some reason, Safari won't return to fullscreen mode despite attempts to click on the icon on the upper right hand corner or by going through the emView/em menu manually. ( I've also tried the short cut keys as well, kbdControl/kbd + KbdCommand/kbd + kbdF/kbd, to no avail).   Is there a way to fix this?  <answer91389> I just solved this problem by quitting safari and reopening it again. Once it's open, i just go into fullscreen mode again and it responded nicely.  <comment80987> Is it just Safari? If not, is the Dock process running or do you have a Dock? <comment82394> @Lauri: It's only Safari, all other apps are running as normal. The mail client is able to exit fullscreen and enter fullscreen as normal. To answer your question: I have a dock but doesn't it always run in the background?
