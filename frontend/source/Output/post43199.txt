Turning off ambient light control? <body> I have a mid-2011 27" iMac. I have realized that the screen brightness adjusts depending on the ambient light. When the sun hides behind the clouds, and the room gets darker, the brightness decreases. I have located the sensor to be the camera. When putting a finger over the camera on top of the screen I can reproduce the sun hiding.  How do I turn this magic feature off?  <answer43200> strongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Displays &#x2192; Automatically adjust brightness/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VKFkf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer43201> In System Preferences, go to the Displays section, under Hardware. There is a slider to control brightness, and right under it (or next to it) there is a checkbox to control automatic brightness adjustment.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N5j5I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment49088> Thanks! I really tried to google for this answer but didn't find anything relevant. StackExchange is the greatest. <comment167583> I have a mid-2010 27" iMac, using OS Lion. The "Automatically adjust brightness" checkbox does not appear in Displays. <comment168967> @MikeSchneider Before 2011, iMacs were not equipped with an ambient light sensor, so they can't measure brightness levels. Sorry!
