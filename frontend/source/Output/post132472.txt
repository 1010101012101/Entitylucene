I can no longer use my Kingston DTSE9 flash drive because it is 'write-protected'. How can I remove the write-protection? <body> Disk Utility won't allow me to Erase or Repair the drive, it will only let me verify it.   Clicking on Disk Partition, I get the following message: This partition cannot be modified. This disk is not writable and can not be partitioned.  I used this thumb drive to transfer files from my mac to a PC, and it became write protected after a transfer from one to the other.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MOdSU.png" alt="Screen Shot 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BPWwS.png" alt="Screen Shot 2"  <answer132473> Edit: See Buscar's response first. If this is not the case:  FAT-32 formatted flash drives should not spontaneously become write-protected; it's a sign that either the drive's controller (yes, flash drives have controllers) is corrupted requiring a reformat, or the drive is physically failing. The two aren't mutually exclusive. Every solution I found perusing Google provide a fix within Windows, rather than OSX. I highly suspect that the drive itself is failing and you should backup all data on it and purchase a new one  How to remove a write protection from your USB memory Stick:     ol   liShutdown your computer or laptop/li   liInsert USB Memory Stick into your laptop or Computer/li   liTurn on computer and then immediately start pressing (F8) key then Advanced Boot Options screen will come up/li   liSelect Safe Mode with Command Prompt/li   liAfter loading files if your USB Memory Stick drive letter is (G) for example then write as/li   liC:\windows\system32G: and press enter/li   liG:format G: and press enter/li   liIf ask you (Y/N) then press (Y) and press enter/li   liNow a full format will start which remove write protection from USB Memory Stick./li   /ol   Remove without reformatting:     ul   liAn alternative option is to access your system’s registry./li   liOnce you plug in your flash drive, hit the “Start” menu and select “Run” and type “regedit” for the Registry Editor. /li   liGo to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies.

Rarely some memory cards/Pen Drives are having physical button/switch (yes a miniature mechanical switch) to make it write protect..   Check your pendrive to make sure you did not accidentally activate it by puling/pushing the USB.   <comment156840> This is a good point.
