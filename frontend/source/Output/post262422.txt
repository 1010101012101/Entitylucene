MacBook Pro icons damaged after Sierra Update <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tBtJd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Some icons in Launchpad are damaged since I've updated to macOS Sierra, like DVD Player, Mail, Image Capture, Contacts. How can I fix this?  <answer271269> I fixed this and any other errors with a simple (yeah, riggghhhttt....) reinstall!  <comment328752> What's the question?
