How to make global keychain in Mac OS X Lion <body> I need to create a keychain that can be used by any user.   When I check a keychain as shared in Keychain Acess-Edit-Keychain List, it just disappears and I can't see this keychain in the list anymore.  What's the problem? Thanks.  <answer38328> Create the new keychain in  strong/Library/Keychains//strong  like the System.keychain, this way any user can access the keychain.  <comment40129> how did you create this keychain? if you did it in code, can you modify your question to show your code?
