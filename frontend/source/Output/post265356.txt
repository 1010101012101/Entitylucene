Trouble shooting/recovery from botched Migration from Yosemite to Sierra <body> Time Machine backup of Yosemite MBP migrated to new MBP running Sierra on which new/different user account was set up. All settings including old MBP user account were migrated. Now, screen goes black when attempting to logon using old MBP account pW. Migration Assistant apparently created second user account using old MBP account, so old MBP account password is not accepted. On old MBP, Guest logon is not permitted access to files and folders, and is limited to Safari so that setting was apparently migrated. Data and Apps successfully Migrated. Any suggestions for a work around. Might have to wipe and reinstall Sierra.
