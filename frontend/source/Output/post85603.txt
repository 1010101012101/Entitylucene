Default settings for pmset -g? <body> I remember changing some values to disable Deep sleep mode and hibernation a few months ago, and realised that my battery drains faster now. I just want to revert all settings to default. I changed some back such as codehibernationmode 3/code, but not sure if I'm missing anything else.  Are these values normal for a 15" Retina Macbook Pro ?  (I'd appreciate if anyone can crosscheck with theirs if you didn't tamper with the settings in codepmset -g/code )  On power :   precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay         7200  standby              1  womp                 1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  darkwakes            1  gpuswitch            2  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            0  sleep                0  autopoweroffdelay    14400  hibernatemode        3  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         60  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  and on battery :  precodeBattery Power       -1* AC Power        -1 Currently in use:  standbydelay         7200  standby              1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  darkwakes            0  gpuswitch            2  disksleep            0  sleep                180  autopoweroffdelay    14400  hibernatemode        3  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         5  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  Thanks  <answer85611> Here's my configuration on AC:  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use: standbydelay         4200 standby              0 womp                 1 halfdim              1 hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage sms                  1 networkoversleep     0 disksleep            0 sleep                0 autopoweroffdelay    14400 hibernatemode        3 autopoweroff         1 ttyskeepawake        1 displaysleep         0 acwake               0 lidwake              1 /code/pre  â€¦and on battery:  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1* AC Power        -1 Currently in use: standbydelay         4200 standby              0 halfdim              1 sms                  1 hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage disksleep            10 sleep                0 autopoweroffdelay    14400 hibernatemode        3 autopoweroff         1 ttyskeepawake        1 displaysleep         0 acwake               0 lidwake              1 /code/pre  Please note that I do have a MacBook Pro 13" (Non-retina), however that shouldn't matter.  <answer91162> Complete answer :   Some options like codeSleep/code and codedisplaysleep/code,  can be modified through codePower Saving/code in the codeSystem Preferences/codepanel.   Wikipedia isn't as complete as the documentation  About the differences with Faiz's pmset :   ul liThe rMPB has 2 GPU = GPU switch to save power or enhance performance/li liThe rMBP has no HDD = SMS (uses sensors in the HDD to protect the HDD) has no use/li licodestandbydelay/code : delay before the data present in the RAM is copied into the HDD/SSD. Default is 4200 (seconds, about ~1h), so the computer shifts from sleep mode to deep sleep mode. /li liWOMP for Wake : wake on ethernet magic packet.

Configuration profiles for AC/Battery/UPS differ on a model by model basis, but the numerical value assigned to the default profiles (rather than custom) respectively remains the same. Thus, you can always revert to pmset defaults by running the following command. I've appended codepmset -g/code to the command so the current configuration is shown after running it:  precodepmset -c 2 -b 1 -u 1; pmset -g /code/pre  You can confirm these are the defaults after running the command by opening   codeSystem Preferences &gt; Energy Saver/code and seeing that the code"Restore to Defaults"/code option is greyed out.  <comment98663> Do you have an SSD by any chance ? <comment98664> No, I don't - that's possibly why your pmset has more arguments than mine does. If it helps, there's a Wikipedia page on pmset that describes what each of the arguments are: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pmset <comment289193> Hint: use semicolon `;` to separate commands, not pipe `|`. <comment291178> @t0r0X why not pipe? go on.... <comment291179> A pipe takes the output from the first command and passes it as input to the second. But `pmset` doesn't take its commands from the standard input so all the pipe does here is discard the output of the first `pmset`. <comment291181> @patrix that actually makes sense. will edit. thanks :) <comment292554> Back from vacation. @ njboot patrix explained it. @patrix thanks!
