Problem signing into Apple ID <body> I can't sign into iCloud because the account is set up under my OLD email address and I don't remember the password. How can I change the iCloud account to new email address so that it is useable?  I am using an iPhone 5s with iOS 9.2.  <answer220213> If you don't have Find My iPhone enabled: On your iPhone, go to Settings  iCloud and tap Sign Out on the bottom. Then just sign back in with your new email address.  If you do: Go to the link below and use it to reset the password for the emold/em email.  You can manage your Apple ID at appleid.apple.com.  <comment266509> Start at https://iforgot.apple.com <comment266510> I have an apple ID that I can access but it is connected to my newer email address.  icloud is connected to OLD email address with no memory of password <comment266511> @Lulu Okay, I've edited my answer. <comment266512> The phone will still be activation-locked to the original ID. You will, at some point, have to remember the password. <comment266513> @Tetsujin Right, but only if the OP has Find My iPhone enabled. If that's the case, he'll have to go to the link I provided and reset the password for the old email adress. I'll edit my answer.
