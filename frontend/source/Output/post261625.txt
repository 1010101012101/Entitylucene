Macbook Pro early 2011 Thunderbolt to USB <body> I am looking into expanding my macbook pro's USB ports as I only have 1 USB port working and I have tried everything from resetting SMC and PRAM, frimware updates, etc.  Using a USB hub from the remaining USB port is not really an option as I use it for my Traktor Pro 2 Soundcard  I have been looking around for a Thunderbolt to USB hub/dock but they are quite expensive.  I was thinking will a Thunderbolt to firewire adapter, Then Firewire to USB work?  If not, are there any other options in expanding the USB ports without using the last remaining USB port?  Thanks  <answer261631> In your question what did you mean by: emUsing a USB hub from the remaining USB port is not really an option as I use it for my Traktor Pro 2 Soundcard/em.  I can't think of any reason why using a USB hub would be a problem? If it's a concern about power requirements then there are many powered USB hubs available.  As for a Thunderbolt to FireWire adapter and then a FireWire to USB adapter, this should work.  However, if it was me I'd go with a powered USB hub.  <answer261634> Looking at the Traktor Pro 2 Specifications page, doesn't have any requirement that the USB port must be bus powered or host only.  In fact, they even state there is an optional Power Supply availabe:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v3c3Al.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, the PS is only required if you can't get the 5V .5A from the bus (host).  In this case you have a couple of options  ul liUse the Power Supply/li liUse a powered hub/li /ul  As for going Thunderbolt to Firewire then to USB, I am a proponent of using the "right tool for the job."  Can you do it?  Yes.  But it's a bodge.sup1/sup    Insead, go directly from TB to USB with a  Thunderbolt to USB adapter  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDpj7m.png" alt="enter image description here"  Finally, you never did say why your USB connector doesn't work nor which one. In my experience, it could be a very inexpensive fix to repair the connector.  This is definately something you should look into.   hr  sup1/sup emBodge:/em  emVerb. 1.
