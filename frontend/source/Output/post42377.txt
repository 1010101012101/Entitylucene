How to Unset iTunes Track Start And Stop Time For Multiple Tracks? <body> For some reason a lot of tracks in my iTunes library have senseless start and stop times set. This is really annoying as some tracks get skipped after a few seconds. There are Apple Script commands for setting them but I didn't find a way to clear all times. How can I batch clear them?  <answer42405> I just tried this script from dougs scripts on latest iTunes and it worked on the few tracks I selected.   http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=resettracksstartstop
