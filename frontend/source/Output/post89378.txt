Mac App Store Problem <body> Memory Clean update &amp; Pocket new purchase both stuck in installing bar, though in MAS purchase page appears " installed". Both appear in launchpad as if in progress but with full bar.  <comment104909> Sorry but what is your question here? <comment105223> I can't use/install/uninstall neither !
