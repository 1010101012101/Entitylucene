I've bought Mountain Lion, but where can I download it now? <body> With the release of Mavericks, Mountain Lion seems to have disappeared from the AppStore. At least I could not find anything.  According to this thread:     It's still possible to buy OS X Mountain Lion in the Apple Online   Store  http://store.apple.com/us/product/D6377Z/A/os-x-mountain-lion   I have no intention of buying it again, so does anybody know a way to download it?  <answer110046> OS X Mountain Lion should still be listed in list of purchased applications in the OS X App Store application. You can download it from there.
