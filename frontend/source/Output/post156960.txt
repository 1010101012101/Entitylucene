GarageBand not starting after Snow Leopard upgrade <body> Starting four days ago, I wasn't able to open any of the icons at the bottom of the page of my MacBook. I downloaded Snow Leopard, and now I can open all but GarageBand. This is a complete mystery to me.   I'm currently at OS X 10.6.3. (my Mac was bought used, do I need something newer to run Garageband?. How can I get GarageBand to run again?   <answer156962> You need a GarageBand version 6.05 from here.  And you need to update your Snow Leopard to 10.6.8
