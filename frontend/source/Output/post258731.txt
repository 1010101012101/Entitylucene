MacBook Pro temporarily malfunction after accidentally plugging a key into the USB port <body> I have a non-retina Mid-2012 MacBook Pro. Today I accidentally plugged a key into the USB port and it powers off abruptly and won't turn on. Later when I come back to the laptop it turns on normally. Everything works fine, from the laptop to the USB port. Is this sudden shutdown normal, do I needs to worry about anything else?
