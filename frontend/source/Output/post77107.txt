How I can unminimize windows from an application using a key combination? <body> Coming from the Windows world, I was initially used to using Cmd-Tab to switch between open windows. On OS X this switches between applications, so I had to learn to use Ctrl-` to switch between windows in an application. However, even this doesn't seem to switch to minimized windows and (for better or worse) I am in the habit of minimizing windows. The only way I have found to unminimize them is to long-click on the icon in the dock and select the window I want, which is annoying. Is there a key combination I can use which will switch between windows and unminimize them at the same time, or any related keys which would help?  I am using OS X 10.8.  <answer77119> Witch includes minimized windows by default. You can also assign shortcuts for showing only minimized windows and unminimizing windows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ifEfq.png" alt=""  You could also assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application (path to frontmost application as text)     try         set miniaturized of windows to false -- most applications     end try     try         set collapsed of windows to false -- at least Finder     end try end tell /code/pre  If minimizing windows to application icons is not enabled, this clicks the icon for the last minimized window in the Dock:  precodetry     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Dock"         click (last UI element of list 1 where role description is "minimized window dock item")     end tell end try /code/pre  <answer82184> I'm from the same boat;  the best native keyboard-only  I've found is  ol likbdCTRL/kbd-kbdDOWN-Arrow/kbd; (you enter app expose)/li likbdDOWN-arrow/kbd; (if there are any minimized windows, this'll put a cursor on one)/li likbdLEFT-arrow/kbd/kbdRIGHT-arrow/kbd (to select from multiple minimized windows) emor/em hold OPT if you want all of them restored./li likbdRETURN/kbd/li /ol  hr  alternative step1: getting into app expose before you've kbdalt/kbd-kbdcmd/kbd'ed to an app:  with kbdCMD/kbd still held down, (the task switcher is visible) tap kbdDOWN/kbd, or kbdUP/kbd, or kbd1/kbd (now in app expose)  hr  The above shows only one app's minimized windows at a time; for selecting from any minimized window regardless of app, kbdCTRL/kbd-kbdF3/kbd moves focus to the dock, and you can arrow left to get to the minimized list.  if your kbdCTRL/kbd-kbdF3/kbd instead shows you the app-expose, try kbdFN/kbd-kbdCTRL/kbd-kbdF3/kbd. (In my settings/keyboard, I've flagged "Use all kbdF1/kbd, kbdF2/kbd, etc. keys as standard function keys")  hr  Some apps have specific alternatives; I use Terminal's kbdCMD/kbd-window_number, which unminimizes and focuses that window.  <answer82185> If you want to unminimize ALL windows (not just from one application), you can create the following Automator service and assign it a hot key.  In Automator, create strongnew service/strong  Give it one action: strongRun Shell Script/strong  The shell script is this:  codekillall -HUP Dock/code  This will kill the Dock process (which will then respawn), in the process liberating all windows that have been minimized into the Dock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtoaK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Save the service, then use strongSystem Preferences/strong to assign a shortcut key to the service.  <answer123259> Take a look at tip #10 on http://www.macworld.com/article/2048857/10-tips-for-managing-minimized-windows.html -- that did it for me.  Essentially, you use kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbdTab/kbd/kbd~/kbd as usual, and for minimized windows, hold down the kbd⌥ Opt/kbd key before releasing the kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd key, and the application opens as you last minimized it.  <comment89504> This doesn't really seem to work. Using Witch's default Window Cycle key includes minimized windows in the list, but doesn't actually unminimize them when you switch to them. <comment133675> Using this technique one can easily follow the same path with gestures <comment144297> This works, but seems very clumsy to me; I have to _know_ it was minimised (which isn't obvious from the Cmd-Tab window), and the keychord isn't exactly easy to manage either. Thanks though :) <comment294719> I either can't get this to work on El Capitan, or can't follow what it's trying t say.
