Help merging free space partition with Macintosh HD partition <body> I installed and then un-installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my Macbook Air (OS X El Capitan 10.11.6). I had split the hard drive into 2 partitions - Macintosh partition of 60.6 GB and now I have a free space partition of 59.6 GB. I'm unable to merge these 2 partitions. I have included some screenshots below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/El6ro.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WH4CM.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MGwN2.png" alt=""  Output from codediskutil list/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8U5P.png" alt=""  Output from codediskutil cs list/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OW8Lh.png" alt=""  Output from codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WXghh.png" alt=""  I'd greatly appreciate any help.  Thanks,  Sophia  <answer250240> Before issuing the command to merge the free space, you will need to fix an error in the GUID Partition Table (GPT). The "Recovery HD" labeled partition with the identifier codedisk0s3/code has a GUID of code48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC/code. The correct value should be code426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC/code.  One way, to correct this error, would be to boot from OS X Internet Recovery and enter the following commands in a Terminal application window.   precodediskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0 gpt remove -i 3 /dev/disk0 diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0 gpt add -i 3 -b 119050312 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0 /code/pre     Note: The strongthree/strong keys you need to hold down to start "OS X Internet Recovery" are kbdOption/kbdkbdCommand âŒ˜/kbdkbdR/kbd.   Once the above commands have been entered, you can restart the computer back to El Capitan.  The Terminal application command to merge the free space is given below.  precodediskutil  resizevolume  /dev/disk0s2  R /code/pre  This command will move code/dev/disk0s3/code to the bottom of codedisk0/code while resizing code/dev/disk0s2/code to maximum size.  <comment310625> that worked perfectly - thank you so much!!
