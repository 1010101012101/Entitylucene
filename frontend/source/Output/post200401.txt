How to remove OS X Installer for 10.10. to get back to 10.7, the originally installed OS? <body> I ran OS X 10.7 latest version on my MacBookPro 2011.br Then I installed on an external USB stick 10.10.3 from my running system OS X 10.7.br The installation on the stick was successful.     After testing 10.10 for some minutes I restarted the system, took of the usb-stick and wanted to restart from my internal disk the 10.7 system.br However, now there is the installer and insists on installing 10.10, what I do not want to do.     The disk utility says that my internal disk is not writable and that I cannot modify it.br Starting with an external disk with 10.7 works, but does not allow to reactivate the internal disk.      Recovery with kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd R /kbd  loads 10.7 via the internet (it therefore still know that the original system is 10.7), but I cannot recover the 10.7 system, since I cannot write to the internal disk.    The internal disk is now Master Boot Record partitioned.br I do not know if it was GUID before or not: At least it worked for three years before.br I have a backup, but since this is 1TB I do not want to load it via a USB 2.0 port.    How can I reactivate my internal disk with 10.7? If reasonable I would change to 10.8 (but not higher) if there is a utility that works with 10.8 only.  Any proposal or links to tool to remove the OS X installer and allow me to restart from my internal disk with 10.7?

You may recover the previous GUID and your missing volume with a disk recovery tool like Disk Warrior to some extent. But since you have a backup just restore it:  ul liIn case you have a Time Machine backup:  ul liBoot to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd.
