Interference/Lag with BT Headset <body> I bought a pair of Logitech HBS700 bluetooth headphones which I've been trying to use with my iPad 3. The problem is, at seemingly random intervals, playback stops and I have to wait for a second before I can resume. I'm streaming to the iPad via WiFi from a Synology Diskstation via a Linksys WAG300N. It seems as though the wifi is somehow interfering with the bluetooth connection. Has anyone else had a similar problem with bluetooth headsets and wifi?  <comment96910> Are you sure the lag is related to the bluetooth headset and not to your WLAN in general?
