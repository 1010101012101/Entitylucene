Does iWork support OpenOffice filetypes? <body> I was thinking about getting iWork as a replacement for OpenOffice.  Since I usually saved my files to the OpenOffice format (OpenDocument), I was wondering if it's possible to read these files with iWork. Most important would be reading of code.odt/code (Text) and code.ods/code (Spreadsheets). The ability to write these files isn't emthat/em important.  Saving the files to MS-Office first isn't an option though.  I also noticed that Quick-Look displays code.odt/code files on a system that doesn't have OpenOffice installed so there's probably already some OpenDocument support built into OS X?  <answer3989> I just created some test documents (code.odt/code, code.ods/code, code.odf/code) in OpenOffice and I was unable to open them in iWork. I was able, however, to open the code.odt/code in TextEdit, which probably accounts for the Quick Look compatibility you mentioned.  <comment3806> bad news, but thanks for testing.
