How to get the Dock to open the Documents and Download folder in Finder? <body> When I click on the Documents or Downloads folder in the Dock, a Grid comes up.  Is there a way to get it to just open in the Finder?  Instead of having to click on Documents and then click on Open in Finder.  <answer51429> Right-click or Control+click on the Documents folder in the Finder, and click 'Make Alias'.  You probably want to move the alias somewhere else and rename it "Documents". Then, drag the Documents alias into the Dock.  Vo√≠la, a link to the Documents folder instead of a Documents folder stack.   <answer51431> ol liHold kbd CMD /kbd while clicking the Documents or Download folder on your dock. It will open up your home directory with Documents or Download folder highlighted./li liPress kbd CMD/kbd + kbd O/kbd to open./li /ol  Or right click on the folder on dock, select "Open Documents"   <answer180983> A slightly quicker way would be right-click or control-click on the dock icon and select "Open 'folder name'".  I do wish "Open in Finder" was at the beginning of the stack/fan for easy access though.
