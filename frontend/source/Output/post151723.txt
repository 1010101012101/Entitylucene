Can any experts here figure out how to get Mavericks' Dock.app working on Yosemite? <body> So one of the deal breakers that was preventing me from upgrading to OS X 10.10 is how ugly the dock looked (to me).   Since I had success getting some of the Yosemite's apps up and running on Mavericks (Yosemite's terminal for example, it supports scrolling with trackpad for some cli programs where you normally have to scroll with C-n, C-p or directional keys), naturally I tried the opposite, i.e. running Mavericks' Dock.app on Yosemite. Surprisingly, it worked! At least, partially. Functionality-wise, it works just fine, but on the looks it is missing the background image of the Mavericks' Dock.app.  Can someone more knowledgeable figure out a way to make this work 100%? As far as I know I'm not the only person wishing for this to work so if you can figure this out, you're doing us, a portion of the Mac community a big favor!  <answer152913> There's an app online called cDocks should sort u out     cDock will unleash your Dock! It's a small program to customize your   dock on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and 10.10 (Yosemite). There are several   dock styles included and users can also create their own custom docks.

I too hated the Yosemite Dock and easily got it with cDock, it is easy to get back your old dock and get coloured docks, app spacers and more. It is a very useful app and I believe will do the trick. You can also get the 10.8 dock as well as 10.9. I think this is the best thing to use. Here are some screenshots. Hope it works out!
