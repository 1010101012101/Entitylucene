Deleting photos that have been backed up iCloud <body> If I delete a photo from my camera roll after backing up on iCloud, will the backup (In this case, the photo I deleted) be affected?   <answer135036> Yes, it could be gone over a period of time as more backups are made and you're forced to delete older backups (or if you remove Camera Roll from the backup selection). The next time the iCloud backup happens, it will create a backup emwithout/em this photo. The older iCloud backup with the photo will continue to remain for as long as you have space available on iCloud and you don't delete old backups.  To view the available iCloud backups for your device, go to strongSettings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup  Manage Storage/strong.  Note that iCloud backup happens  automatically over Wi-Fi every day (only once every 24 hours) while itâ€™s turned on, locked, and connected to a power source. You can also trigger it manually from strongSettings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup  Back Up Now/strong.
