Disable Apache autostart <body> I'm on a fresh 10.9 install and the default Apache server is codeorg.apache.httpd: Already loaded/code after each startup. Is there a way to disable that autostart?  <answer119678> OS X provides codelaunchctl/code to control which daemons are started at boot time.  To stop and disable Apache:  ol liOpen Terminal /li liType the following command (type your login password when codesudo/code requests it):  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist /code/pre/li /ol  strongA few words on codelaunchctl/code's code-w/code option/strong  The code-w/code option is the silver bullet for stopping/disabling Apache. It tells codelaunchctl/code to do its job regardless of any configuration settings that would otherwise prevent it from unloading the service, as explained in codeman launchctl/code:  precode-w       Overrides the Disabled key and sets it to false or true for the load and          unload subcommands respectively. In previous versions, this option would          modify the configuration file. Now the state of the Disabled key is stored          elsewhere on- disk in a location that may not be directly manipulated by any          process other than launchd. /code/pre  (It turns out that, in OS X Mavericks (10.9), "elsewhere on-disk" is code/private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist/code.)  The code-w/code option is indispensable if you started Apache with codeapachectl start/code: as explained in this Superuser answer. codeapachectl/code not only starts Apache but also modifies code/private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist/code like this:  precode&lt;key&gt;org.apache.httpd&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;false/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  In this particular case you can also use codeapachectl/code:  precodesudo apachectl stop /code/pre  to stop Apache and to set codeDisabled/code to codetrue/code.  <comment139764> I tried that, but each time I run `sudo apachectl start` the launch daemon seems to be activated again after restart. <comment139767> Try with `-w`: `sudo launchctl -w unload ...`. If it doesn't help, could you post the output of `ps -ef|grep httpd|grep -v grep`? <comment139821> I tried `-w` before, same result. Here is the output: http://pastebin.com/h14t8fEv <comment139829> Thanks, does `sudo launchctl1 ...` return an error message? Could you post the output of `grep apache /var/log/com.apple.launchd/launchd-shutdown.system.log` and `sudo grep apache /var/log/system.log`? <comment139921> Yes: `sudo: launchctl1: command not found` and here is the output: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=zxKvYV4i <comment139924> Sorry, I made a typo, I meant `sudo launchctl...` and not `sudo launchctl1...`, but I've seen that `launchctl` works as expected, thanks for posting the output. Apache is indeed started by `launchctl` when OS X starts up, the PPID is 1, so "something" re-enables it. Do you have other software, like "OS X Server" (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-server/id714547929?mt=12), that requires Apache? <comment140062> No, it's a fresh install and the only thing I've got installed that could start Apache is Xcode. I remember reading a while ago that `apachectl start` registers the launch daemon. Maybe the best thing to do is execute `launchctl unload` on shutdown? <comment140095> That's the key, `apachectl start` starts Apache and modifies `/private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist` to **enable** it in a similar way `launchctl` does (http://superuser.com/questions/455505/how-do-i-start-apache-in-osx-mountain-lion). Try `apachectl stop`, it should stop **and** disable it for good. <comment140172> Works, thanks a lot! <comment140183> Great, thanks for your feedback, I edited my answer to add information on `apachectl`. Option `-w` would have worked too (at least it worked for me), unfortunately the command I told you to type (`sudo launchctl -w unload ...`) was wrong, the correct syntax is `sudo launchctl unload -w ...`.
