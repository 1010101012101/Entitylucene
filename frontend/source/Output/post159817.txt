Sales at iTunesConnect <body> I'm just wondering how this comes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iaDtd.png" alt="enter image description here"  So there are 3 units sold, but apparently just one of them was paid. Do you know why? The screenshot was taken when having codeTransaction type/code activated.  <answer159830> Check the following break-downs to see exact transactions. How much is your app price? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yK1nL.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TJRVa.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see only one paid version was sold. The other two were free.  <comment187872> The price is 1.99$ <comment187873> What do you see at the bottom of page when you select 'By Transaction Type'? <comment187878> No change. Which transaction type shall I select? <comment187879> When I select 'By Transaction Type' in my portal I can see breakdown by transactions. See updated answer. Do you see something similar? <comment187880> Oh I'm sorry. Thought I shall use the filter. See the question for a screenshot of what I see. <comment187881> So does it show discrepancy? 3 units on top, and 27 units at the bottom? <comment187882> @sha: excuse me, I have no idea what you mean <comment187883> Are these two screenshots part of one screen or you took them from different screens? When I go to this page in my portal - total number on top (3 in your case) matches sum of all numbers at the bottom (detail list, 25+2 in your case). <comment187884> I can see that top one is for Dec 6 only, and bottom one for Nov 30 - Dec 7 period. So they don't rely to each other. Show us the bottom portion for Dec 6 only <comment187885> @sha: I'm sorry for confusion, I uploaded a new screenshot, including both <comment187886> I wonder if a free download is how it looks when a family member gets an app for free with Family Sharing for the app store. I don't know for sure, so I'll comment for now. <comment187887> No. Did you change price on the app recently? Was it originally free? <comment187888> @bmike: I think it will be shown as redownload. <comment187889> @sha: yes I did, but shouldn't that change over night instead of in one day? <comment187891> It might take some time to process and populate. So that might explain free downloads. Wait couple days and see how it will look again. <comment187894> @sha so do you think the 2 free downloads might actually be paid downloads but they are displayed wrong? I will let you know in a few days :) <comment187896> No. What I meant that two downloads happened before your price change took effect. <comment187897> @sha oh I see. Thanks for help :) <comment188023> It actually is not the solution but since you took your time and explained it...
