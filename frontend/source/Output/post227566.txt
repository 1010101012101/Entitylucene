ssh port forwarding error <body> I have two Linux servers and one Mac client, and I would like to do SSH port forwarding via local port address on the Mac.  In Terminal 1 on the Mac,  precodelocalhost:~ user1$ ssh -L 8022:server2:22 server1 /code/pre  and from Terminal 2 on the same Mac  precodelocalhost:~ user1$ scp -P 8022 0.0.0.0:file . /code/pre  works OK. But if I use another account codeuser2/code on the Mac,  precodelocalhost:~ user2$ ssh -L 8022:user1@server2:22 user1@server1 /code/pre  I get the following error on Terminal 2.  precodelocalhost:~ user1$ scp -P 8022 0.0.0.0:file . ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host /code/pre  At the same time, another error message appears in Terminal 1.  precodechannel 3: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed /code/pre  Either codeuser1/code or codeuser2/code does not have any special port forwarding settings in code/etc/sshd_config/code, code/etc/ssh_config/code, or code~/.ssh/config/code. Both users have access for SSH login to the Mac (i.e., in "Remote Login" panel of System Preference, these users are in the white list).  I don't see any message in code/var/log/system.log/code.  Which configuration should I check? I use OS X Yosemite.  hr  Here is the verbose output of the codescp/code command.  precodeExecuting: program /usr/bin/ssh host 0.0.0.0, user (unspecified), command scp -v -f file OpenSSH_6.2p2, OSSLShim 0.9.8r 8 Dec 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 102: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to 0.0.0.0 [0.0.0.0] port 8022. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/cta/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/cta/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/cta/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/cta/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.2 ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host /code/pre  <answer227569> When you initiate port forwarding, you don't specify the user.  precodelocalhost:~ user2$ ssh -L 8022:server2:22 user1@server1 /code/pre  You need to specify user in the second command:  precodelocalhost:~ user1$ scp -P 8022 user1@0.0.0.0:file . /code/pre  That should work fine for you  <comment277402> Thanks a lot. It worked. I probably copied a wrong example from somewhere.
