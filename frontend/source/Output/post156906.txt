Yosemite and Teac A-H01 sound driver- alternatives? <body> The Teac A-H01 requires an audio driver, otherwise the sound becomes watery. Teac hasn't released a driver since Yosemite came out.  Are there any workarounds? It seems like USB external sound is fairly standard, so perhaps there are alternative drivers available?  <answer157544> I have same issue, contacted Teac support and recieved the following     Thank you for contacting TEAC-Audio.      Our engineering department is currently working on this issue. Please be so kind to check our webpage periodically for further info, or a possible driver update.      Thank you for your understanding.

With it you can't run any unsigned drivers and old one is probably unsigned.  You might try to disable kext signing if you want to use the driver. Make sure you absolutely have to do it and you don't have other options since this change is system wide and system is becoming less secure after that.  In Terminal:  precodesudo nvram boot-args="kext-dev-mode=1" /code/pre  And reboot. Then try and report if driver is working.  To go back to kext signing put this in Terminal:  precodesudo nvram boot-args="kext-dev-mode=0" /code/pre  And reboot.  P.S. I have become interested in the DAC and now I see it has Optical Input. So other workaround might be just using miniToslink to Toslink (or just normal Toslink cable if your Mac is a Mac Pro)  <answer168344> ol liDisconnect your TEAC USB cable./li liGo to code/System/Library/Extentions/code, and remove the existing TEAC kext directory, like this: codesudo rm -rf TeacUSBAudio.kext/code/li liReboot./li liRe-install the driver, called codeTEAC USB HS Audio KEXT Install Package 273.4.2.pkg/code at the time of this writing./li liReconnect your TEAC USB cable./li /ol  <comment191737> Your answer would be more useful to others if you could actually summarize the steps you did in english. <comment192044> this works perfectly. thanks! I'm worried optical would be a little more damage-prone (since it's for my "docked" macbook).
