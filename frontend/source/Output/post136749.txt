iOS 7 iAd Implementation & iAd Network Temporarily Unavailable <body> I have submitted three iOS apps and they have all been approved. I implemented iAd into them, and the test ads show when I test the apps. But now they have been on the App Store for a few days, and I haven't seen any ads when I download the apps on devices that are not provisioned as test devices. I have already accepted the iAd contract, and the iAd page simply says "iAd Network is temporarily unavailable Sorry: We were unable to locate information relating to your account. Please try again later".  <answer139239> I have the exact same issue , my app rolled out to the app store today.  Some people say that it takes a couple of days for production ads to show up in new appsbr Can anyone confirm?  <comment164203> Please add this as a comment.
