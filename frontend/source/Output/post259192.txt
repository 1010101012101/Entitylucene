How to type `control + [` on a German iPad Smart Keyboard <body> How do you type codecontrol + [/code on the German Smart Keyboard for iPad.  I am missing the "Esc" on the iPad keyboard a lot in order to discard text fields. I read that codecontrol + [/code might work as a replacement.   How do you type this on a German keyboard layout with code[/code not being a dedicated key.  <answer260038> I had an issue where I couldn't get a question mark to appear using the Apple iPad Smart Keyboard with the German as the language, I would switch back to English for punctuation. I just found that you can have the language set as German but then change the keyboard hardware settings to English and now my question mark button give me a question mark. Yay!  So it may work for your situation too. On your iPad go to Setting  General  Keyboard  Keyboard hardware.
