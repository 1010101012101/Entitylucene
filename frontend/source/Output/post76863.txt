How do I Force Google Maps Links to Open the Google Maps App on iOS6? <body> In the past (iOS5 and earlier) clicking on a link for directions within a website opened the separate maps app and provided directions. How do I force links in websites, that would normally open a google maps link in a "desktop" web browser, to open the new external google maps app? I do not find the current google maps website adequate (can't figure out how it would provide dynamic (voice) directions) and the new apple maps app is not opened by those links.  <answer94193> As Matthieu Riegler said, when you go to the Google maps site you will be prompted to launch the app. Unfortunately, there is no way to do this automatically.  <comment89161> Each time you arrive on the Google Maps site it asks if you want to open the Google Map App.
