Repeated requests to update icloud preferances <body> I keep getting requests to update my iCloud preferences.  I do so by reentering my password the the requests keep coming  <answer238284> I faced the same problem on my MacBook Pro (mid 2012) and I fixed it by following the guidelines mentioned here: http://www.rawinfopages.com/mac/content/keep-being-asked-your-icloud-password     "Go to System Preferences, iCloud and clear all the ticks so that you   are no longer syncing anything to iCloud. You should also go into   every Apple app (FaceTime, Calendar, Messages, iTunes, Reminders,   Notes and any other app you can think of), check the preferences in   each app and if you are signed in to iCloud then sign out.      After disabling all the iCloud sync options in System Preferences and   every single Apple app, return to iCloud in System Preferences and   tick all the boxes again to start syncing once more. You might also   need to sign in again with FaceTime and the other apps you signed out   of."   <comment291975> Is it a legit password prompt or malware?  Please post a screenshot. <comment291990> Have you tried completely signing out and back in again?
