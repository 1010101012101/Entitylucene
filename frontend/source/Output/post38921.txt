How do I reset/recover my superuser password without the boot disk? <body> I lost the superuser password for my iMac and I don't have the boot disk.  I already tried the second answer on this page, but every time I type codesu/code from the command prompt, it still asks for a password that I don't have anymore. Is there another way to reset the superuser password?  <answer38922> I found this on the web.   http://en.kioskea.net/forum/affich-73393-change-mac-admin-password-without-the-disk  The obvious downside is the fact you can't actually recover your password: you'd have to delete the account, and use the new administrator. Nonetheless, you could get hold of the files in the Home Folder before the account is deleted, or even after, as OSX allows you to delete an account but keep the files in it.  The files will be protected, though there are some ways in which you should be able to remove the restrictions on them. You could simply use Terminal to codechown/code the directory and all it's contents, and once you remove the permissions all the files in your previous account should be accessible to your new account.   If you decide to follow this method I could provide more information on how to codechown/code the directory, though a web search should do.  Hope it helps!  <answer42627> precodesudo passwd root /code/pre  Enter YOUR password and you're in.  <answer42628> If you have an administrator user account set up on your Mac in addition to the root account, you can use the Directory Utility to do the following:   ol liOpen the Directory Utility from code/System/Library/CoreServices/code or in OS X 10.11 and later, codeSystem/Library/CoreServices/Applications/code./li liClick the lock button and authenticate as an administrator: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoLFc.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liGo to the menu strongEdit  Change root password.../strong: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mv8bX.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liIt should prompt you to enter a new root password: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QRCSs.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  Again, you have to have access to an administrator account to do this (so you can authenticate).  Good luck.  <answer62550> Open Terminal.app and run:  precodesudo passwd root /code/pre  Type the current admin passwordbr Type the new password to rootbr Re-type new password to root    Done!  <answer95632> The best solution for 10.7 and 10.8 is to boot in recovery mode (CMD+R). Then, open a terminal window and type the command "resetpassword". This will open a window which will allow you to reset any user's password.  http://osxdaily.com/2011/08/24/reset-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-password/  <comment48443> Did you enable the root user and are referring to that "superuser" password, or did you lose the last (or all) admin user's passwords? As long as you have an admin user, sudo and this article will let you reset (but not recover) the old root password. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1528 <comment48445> You can also disable / re-enable the root user and pick a new password following this article. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1528 <comment72235> You can also use `sudo su` if you really need `su`. <comment72237> You might also want to have a look at `sudo -i` and `sudo -s` <comment276017> Thank you, it also works for 10.10.
