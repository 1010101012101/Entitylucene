Screen on macbook pro turns black/red or orangeish whenever fullscreen is on <body> Whenever I watch netflix or youtube and go on fullscreen the screen either turns red and black, or get an orange/yellow tint as soon as the bar at the bottom disappears. The screen is completely normal if it's not in full screen, and when there's subtitles on, it's also fine, but as soon as the subtitles go away it'll turn red and black again. Does anyone know how to fix this?     <comment328409> You don't run any kind of 'monitor tweaker' like f.lux, do you? <comment330099> I don't.
