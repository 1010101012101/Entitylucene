Help me please!  <answer267903> You emmay/em be a victim of Apple changing functionality of Safari features. Something they do all the damn time. Which can be frustrating when you are used to that functionality. Trying to figure out strongwhy/strong Apple does something like this is an exercise in frustration. However...  You can edit your Bookmarks/Favorites under the Bookmarks menu option "Edit Bookmarks"
