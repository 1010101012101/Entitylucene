Safari in macOS 10.12.2 is blinking <body> Not sure why some sites in my reading list is blinking/flickering. Notice those site that blinks has a blank icon. Anyone having this problem too? Happening in private mode too.  Safari  10.0.2 (12602.3.12.0.1)  <answer270018> I just experienced this -- same MacOS and Safari versions as original question. I exited Safari and restarted it, and the problem stopped.  <answer273062> Had the same issue. Fixed it by clearing caches from the codeDevelop/code menu and restarting Safari.  <comment339343> I've had this issue for a couple weeks, restarting Safari seems to be the only reliably way of getting it to stop. <comment344447> I get very hight cpu usage when the side bar is open as well.
