Huge Apple Mail Logs (Connection Logging Enabled) <body> I was doing some routine cleanup of my HDD, when I noticed some huge log files in code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Logs/Mail/code.  Where do I toggle those log files off and on?  <answer223391> In the codeWindow/code menu, there is the codeConnection Doctor/code, which has a checkbox, showing the toggle to enable / disable logging.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZACW.png" alt="Connection Doctor"  You can also see at a glance in the menubar of the main Mail window, if it is enabled:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rTnoV.png" alt="menubar"
