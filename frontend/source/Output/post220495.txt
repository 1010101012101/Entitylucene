Can softwareupdate be used to automatically download (but not install) on the terminal? <body> Could the Terminal command softwareupdate be used to download (but not install) any MacAppStore updates, say with a scheduled Calendar running an Automator/AppleScript script?  <answer220523> From codeman softwaredownload/code:  precode-d | --download     Each update specified by args is downloaded but not installed. The values of args are     the same as for the --install command. Updates downloaded with --download can be sub-     sequently installed with --install, or through the App Store (as long as they remain     applicable to your system).  Updates are downloaded to /Library/Updates, but are not     designed to be installed by double-clicking the packages in that directory: always     use --install or the App Store to actually perform the install. /code/pre  So yes, that is possible. AFAIK iCal has lost the ability to run AppleScript commands a few releases back, so you might be better of with a launchd job.
