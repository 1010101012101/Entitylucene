I mistakenly disabled all services in OS X, now it can't boot <body> I ran:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ /code/pre  by mistake, now my Mac does not boot... Any idea how to fix that?  OS version: Yosemite.  <answer261844> The command codesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons//code will force-disable all launch daemons in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ and add respective entries in a emdisabled.plist/em. The command – entered accidentally – strongdoesn't/strong affect the "unforced" load state of a system daemon but overrides any existing state (loaded/unloaded). Removing the disabled.plist will restore an almost default system configuration – except those daemons or agents which have been forced to one of the two states in the initial configuration of the system or after the installation of a third-party app. This can be salvaged by either restoring the file from a backup or – partly – by copying a disabled.plist file from a similar system.  To get your system booting again you have to remove this special file in Recovery Mode.  ul liBoot to Recovery Mode/li liOpen Terminal in the menubar Utilities  Terminal/li licd to /Volumes/NameOfMainSystemVolume/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchdbr Replace NameOfMainSystemVolume by the name of your main volume (e.g. Macintosh\ HD)/li lilist all files with codels -la/code. You will get a list containing ~20 files - all related to user IDs - and a large file emdisabled.plist/em (~10-15 KB)/li liremove the files with coderm *.plist/code/li liReboot, edit /private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/disabled.plist with codesudo nano …/code and replace the existing content – probably some basic xml plist header and one or more daemon, which may have been added by the system while booting - by the following content:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.ManagedClientAgent.enrollagent&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.ftpd&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.rpmuxd&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.usbmuxd&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.mrt&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.stackshot&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;org.ntp.ntpd&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.pacemaker&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  This should be the default content of the file in Yosemite. If you had installed additional 3rd-party apps, it probably contained more daemons previously. E.g I had to remove a Little Snitch and a XQuartz related system daemon to get a somehow "default" emdisabled.plist/em./li /ul  <comment327873> Thx for edit, version is Yosemite <comment327893> Are you able to boot into single-user mode (Cmd-S) or Safe mode (Shift)? <comment327896> Single user only, I tried to do `sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` from there but it didn't help. <comment327901> Hmm.  Okay, we're already in over my head :)  Maybe have a look at [this post](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192878/accidentally-unload-all-launchctl-daemons?rq=1)? <comment327902> Thx, that's it. Actually I'm trying to reinstall the system without deleting user data.... If I find a fix, I'll post there too. <comment327904> @klanomath, reinstall did not work. I think I'm going to rename /System/Library into /System/Library_old and try a reinstall <comment327907> Ok, maybe somewhere in /var ? <comment327911> Thx a lot, I was actually looking at that file right now. It worked :) <comment327912> @Vincebzh I will add the (more or less) default content of the file. Just a second <comment342117> Had a similar issue, got it solved here http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192878/accidentally-unload-all-launchctl-daemons <comment342166> @grgarside Re: your edit. `sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` only writes to disabled.plist but **not** to the other (user related ie. 0;248;501;...) plists. AFAIR I tested this with the root user and fseventer! <comment342167> That's what I thought, but the OP of the linked duplicate is demanding otherwise: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192878/accidentally-unloaded-all-launchctl-daemons-and-now-cant-boot?noredirect=1&lq=1#comment342160_192878
