YouTube apps not downloadable from AppStore to iPad <body> A colleague asked for help with an intriguing iPad problem that I was not able to solve. YouTube app "suddenly stopped working". I am not sure if she deleted the app herself but it is not on her iPad anymore. Thinking this was a quick fix, I quickly found out that strongYouTube app (or any other apps based on YouTube) will not download on her iPad from App Store./strong   We have tried/checked the following:  ul liWe attempted the download in App Store through all of these: emUpdates/em, emUpdates  Purchased/em and emSearch/em. The buttons "download" and "update" are grey and don't work, so you cannot even attempt the download. /li liWe updated her iOS to 9.3.5 last week, but that did not help. (Version 10 came available afterwards.)/li liThere is enough space on her device, so that isn't the problem either (and in this case you would normally be able to press "download" anyway)./li liYouTube website won't open on her browser, but mobile version of the service does. Also e.g. Dailymotion videos do play normally./li /ul  Is system recovery the only option left?  <comment315312> Have you checked Restrictions to see if it is disallowed?
