Spotlight preferences ignored <body> I have set Spotlight preferences to show System Preferences first, and not show Webpages:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zdyj0.png" alt="enter image description here"  and yet these seem to be ignored:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZjQcN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Specifically:  ul lithe "top hit" is never a System Preference. (Although the first result after it always is, if relevant.)/li liweb searches are emalways/em included./li /ul  Is there a way to fix this? I'm using a recently updated Mavericks.  <answer205826> After a bit of investigation, I realise this was mostly a misunderstanding:  ul lireordering the categories doesn't affect what gets chosen as "top hit"/li lithe "web searches" are not "web pages". Web searches are always shown./li /ul  So: Spotlight preferences are taken into account, they just don't affect those two things.
