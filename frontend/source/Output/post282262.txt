My iCloud icon has disappeared and I can't log in to verify my Apple ID <body> I can't verify my email Apple ID, but it's my Apple ID and I have never changed it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FE8bN.png" width="320"  <answer282275> I suggest checking to make sure that your email is correct. I have unintentionally messed up my email, it happens.   Other than that, log on to a PC and try logging in to your email.  <comment355450> What iCloud icon are you referring to?
