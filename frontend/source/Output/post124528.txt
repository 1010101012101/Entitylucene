Shortcut key to special characters <body> I'm developer from Belgium, so I'm using an AZERTY keyboard,  and for some reason Apple has a reduced AZERTY keyboard compared to the QWERTY keyboard, some special charters like code{}/code &amp; code[]/code The code{/codecan be made with the kbd‚å•/kbd key and kbd(/kbd, but for the `[]' isn't such a key available, so is there a way to make a keyboard shortcut to those? Could be helpful since I'm a PHP developer, otherwise I'll consider to buy an QWERTY keyboard.  Thanks  <answer124533> For the Apple French or Belgian azerty layouts, [] should be at option plus shift plus ().  <comment145681> Yes, that is the right one! Thanks a lot! :)
