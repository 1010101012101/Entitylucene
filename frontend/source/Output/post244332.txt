Apple Mail moving wrong messages to Junk Box <body> I have two mail accounts A and B and I don't want the mails from B to be junk filtered. I enabled "junk mail filtering" in the settings and I ticket the option "perform custom actions". The rules I defined are  ul liAccount is A/li liMessage is junk mail/li liTo does not contain address from B/li liAny recipient does not contain address from B/li liSender is not in my contacts/li liSender is not in my previous recipients/li /ul  And the action is simply:  ul liMove message to Junk Box of A/li /ul  I also configured that strongall/strong of the rules need to be met in order to perform the action.  My problem is that Mail still moves Mails from B to the Junk Box of A, how can I avoid that?  h1Update/h1  I just confirmed that the fact that Mail sends the mails to the wrong junk-box is because of my rules because when I disable the advanced rules, mails will be put into the right junkbox (which does strongnot/strong solve the problem! I only want the junk from strongonly one/strong account to be put into its junkbox!)  <comment301113> My guess (& it's not something I can really test) is that the junk filter is moving them before they even reach your ruleset. <comment301116> @Tetsujin but why does it move the mail to the junkbox of a different account? It wouldn't be so bad if it was moving them to its own junkbox. I even tried to check the option that says "filter junk mail before applying my rules" but the mails are still moved to the wrong mailbox <comment301125> Not sure. I'd just add another rule above. If B: stop evaluating rules. <comment301131> I tested some more and it's clear that the condition is not evaluated before the action is performed. It would be interesting if someone can confirm that this is actually working because apple support told me that my configuration is in fact correct for what I want to achieve. Looks like a bug in those custom actions. <comment301190> I'd still try ...  If B: stop evaluating rules <comment301892> @Tetsujin you cant define rules like that in the advanced rules of junk mail. You can specify a bunch of rules and issue a bunch of actions if all or any of these rules are met. I can add another rule at the rules tab of the settings dialog, but those don't affect the advanced junk mail rules. <comment301944> ah, OK - I've never actually used the built-in Junk filter, I have a 3rd party one, so I assumed your Rules were in the regular Rules list. <comment301946> Those rules have the same problem. The action is performed without the conditions being met. <comment301949> Sorry, I cannot repro your issue. I have 18 different rules in my list, some of them with up to 20 components - & not a thing ever gets mis-filed. <comment301951> Well... As I said. It's a bug. I have confirmed that the conditions are ignored with several test rules. It's not an assumption.
