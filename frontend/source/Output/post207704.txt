Keep command output in terminal screen <body> I'm new to Mac, when I use terminal, I found some commands like codegit log/code behaviours different from Linux.  On Linux, they will print result on screen and exit, leave all result on screen and I can see it when I input another command. Screen after running command like this:  precode$ git log commit ********** Author: ****** ....  $ /code/pre  But on Mac, they will print result to a "new screen", after exit, all result will be cleaned so I can't see the previous result. Screen after running command looks like this:  precode$ git log $  /code/pre  Result has been cleared form screen.  Can I change some settings to make it behaviours like linux? Thanks.  <answer207717> The output of codegit log/code is sent to a pager for display, which can be configured via codegit config/code (variable name is codecore.pager/code). By default, codeless/code is used, so you may want to compare the value of code$LESS/code on both systems.  <comment250588> From script or interactive? <comment250591> @willWorkForCookies interactive <comment250600> What is `$TERM` for both? <comment250601> Let's focus on `git` here. If you have similar issues with `grep` (and the answer you get for `git` don't help you to solve them), please ask a new question for this. <comment250602> @0942v8653 For linux is xterm, for mac is xterm-256color <comment250606> That's kind of odd, I've never seen `grep` use a pager automatically... Usually I have to rerun and pipe into less myself. <comment250609> Thanks! On linux `$LESS` is not set and on Mac it has been set to `-R`, means repaint the screen, after put `unset LESS` to `.zshrc` this issue solved. BTW, I confuse the `grep` and `git grep`, sorry for that. <comment250611> @0942v8653 sorry, i confused the `grep` and `git grep`, so sorry
