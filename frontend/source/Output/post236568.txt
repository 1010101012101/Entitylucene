Administrator account apparently lost after forced reboot of OS X <body> Yesterday I ran into one of those rare problems with OS X (10.11.4) where I thought I had to reboot my MacBook. The cursor wheel was constantly spinning and I was unable to quit any apps or even access codeForce Quit .../code. (This was triggered inside Firefox.) So a reboot seemed like an easy way out.  Unfortunately the reboot seems to have corrupted the setup in a bad way. I normally have two user accounts on the MacBook, like codeA/code and codeB/code, where codeA/code is also the administrator account.   After the reboot codeA/code now seems to have disappeared. It e.g. does not show up under codeSystem Preferences/code | codeUsers/code, nor in code/etc/passwd/code. It is also no longer available as a choice in codeLogin Window .../code. The lost account's files still seem to remain under code/Users/A//code, but I can no longer access them because I no longer have administrator privileges.   I this a know problem (perhaps even an indication of malware)? How can I restore account codeA/code and its administrator privileges without risking corruption of its (presumably) remaining original files in code/Users/A//code? (At least I do have recent Time Machine backups and can log in as codeB/code.)  <answer236677> Turns out I was lucky. Booting into Single User Mode (for obtaining administrator privileges as described here) apparently caused some extra disk check. This presumably led to the restoration of some corrupted piece of (meta)data and in effect my account codeA/code, including its previous administrator privileges.   Looks as if the system is back to normal now: much relief!  <comment289550> If you have a Time Machine backup, why not just restore? <comment289674> @IronCraftMan This would seem to make the situation worse (i.e. overwrite all files on my MacBook) before it makes it better. I'd prefer to try something like the following first: 1) obtain administrator privileges for `B`; 2) rename `/Users/A` to `/tmp/X`; 3) recreate account `A`; 4) replace `/Users/A` by `/tmp/X`; 5) shift administrator rights from `B` back to `A`. That's at least the theory ...
