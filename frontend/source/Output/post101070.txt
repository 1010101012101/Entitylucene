Macbook Pro cannot connect to Wireless Hotspot created by a Ubuntu 12.04 Laptop <body> I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on my dell laptop and have created a wi-fi hotspot, with WEP 40/128bit encryption (And I know the security key).  My Macbook Pro finds this network but when I try to connect I get a dialog saying "This network uses WPA enterprise authentication" and asks me for username and password.  None of the following combinations for username and password worked:  Username : network namebr Password: network key  Username: my ubuntu system usernamebr Username: my ubuntu system password  I tried setting the hotspot in both Ad-hoc and Infrastructure mode. Neither worked.  Notes :  1) I am very new to Mac world.br 2) I access internet via a 4G (LTE) USB Modem. Hence the need to setup Wi-Fi hotspot.  <comment118982> It is not clear from your question if you actually know the WEP? or just guessing it ! <comment119009> @Buscarì›ƒ If you are asking whether I know the WEP key, then yes I do. I am setting up the hotspot and I know the security key. Edited the question to reflect it. <comment119882> Does it connects if you do not use WPA?
