Restore libxml2 to Yosemite <body> Ok, so here is the deal. I was working on two projects at the same time and I mistakenly:  precoderm -rf /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib /code/pre  I have another copy of libxml2 thankfully (the other project, homebrew install libxml2). That copy is in /usr/local/opt/libxml/lib. For the life of me I can not get cp /usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/libxml2.2.dylib /usr/lib to work. It always says:  precode/usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib Read-only Filesystem /code/pre  Please can anyone help? I have tried cp -S, -R, -F and I can't get it to cp or mv. I just need to write that lib back and I should be good to go. I don't know what I was thinking when I did that. Running Yosemite 10.10.2, Late-2011 mbp. Libxml2 from homebrew is 2.9.2 I think if it makes a difference.   <answer169702> ul liEnter code/sbin/mount -uw //code and copy 'libxml2.2.dylib' from '/usr/local/opt/libxml/lib/' to '/usr/lib/'/li liRestart your Mac and restore the original file:/li liDownload Pacifist (i think it's a 14-day trial) and the Yosemite System Installer/li liRight-click the 'Install OS X Yosemite.app' - 'Show Package Contents'/li liMount ./Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/seKdX.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liOpen the mounted 'OS X Install ESD'/li liOpen ./Packages/BaseSystemBinaries.pkg with Pacifist/li liIn the new Pacifist-window navigate to 'Content of BaseSystemBinaries/usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib'/li liRight-click libxml2.2.dylib and install it/li liRestart your Mac/li /ul  <comment199362> The version of libxml in Homebrew is I think different from the one in OS X - you need to reinstall OS X and not do that link <comment199363> Um ... you did try to use `sudo`, didn't you? <comment199365> You mean there is no way I can get a libxml2 from another Yosemite? I am forced to reinstall? Yes, I did use sudo <comment199366> I am in single user mode. I don't think I can right click. Maybe in recovery? <comment199368> If I can do it from single user with no libxml then yes, my gf has a macbook air <comment199370> @RinconRex try `/sbin/mount -uw /` before copying. In single user mode the file system is mounted read-only. Your mileage starting OS X with the homebrew libxml2.2dylib may vary... <comment199371> Ok, well I have to wait until my gf gets home. Any tips to make the ssh login smooth? I'm in Berlin btw so she just left for work, no rush on any of this. I have all day. <comment199374> OMG You are a genius sir. It worked! I tried mount -o remount,rw / but nothing. Yours did the trick, back up and running! <comment199375> Hmm now continue with my answer to restore the original dylib <comment199376> Yes, thank you. I will restore the Yosemite dynamic lib. Thanks again! <comment199380> I don't see Shared Support anywhere <comment199385> Mine has no shared support, I have the exact same window as you but not that folder. Just checked the zip too, no shared support, am I downloading the wrong copy? I have 3.2.17 <comment199386> @RinconRex How big is your Yosemite Installation.app? Mine have 5.17 GB (10.0.1) and 5.19 GB (10.0.2 downloaded to the Applications folder yesterday!) <comment199388> Actually it seems I am having trouble with Yosemite system installer being found. <comment199389> @RinconRex Ahh ok. Do not right-click Pacifist (just install it somewhere) but 'Install Yosemite OS X.app' (i don't really know the english name of it) ;-) <comment199419> Ok, finally got it all done. It took quite a long time to get Yosemite Installer downloaded. Also, I had to reinstall libxsml.1.dylib and libexsml.0.dylib as well. Any ideas why? I never touched either of them, doesnt seem possible that they both came up "wrong architecture". <comment199421> @RinconRex No clue, probably the specific installer instructions demands to install the whole bunch of *xsml.dylibs.
