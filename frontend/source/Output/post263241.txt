Connecting an external hard drive to my MacBook Air <body> How do I connect an external hard drive to my MacBook Air? And once it is connected, how do I find it to see what is on my external hard drive? Very new to Apple products.  <answer263242> You can connect external Hard Disk Drive to any of the USB ports using standard cable.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JSktn.png" alt="enter image description here"  As soon as you connect it, HDD's icon shall appear on your desktop automatically.  <answer263247> In Finder Preferences, there is a way to show/hide certain items on the desktop. If you plug in your hard disk and you emdon't/em see it, try changing these options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YjgFI.png" alt="Finder Preferences"  <comment329839> You can also connect external hard drives to the Thunderbolt port if the device has a Thunderbolt cable or you have an adapter.
