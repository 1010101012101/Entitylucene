iCloud login loading <body> I changed my Apple ID password and want to login to iCloud with my Mac.  Entered password, and now it shows me loading and I can't do anything: neither restart the computer nor cancel the request.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jpClw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Please help, it has been over 10 minutes . . .  <answer225597> Force restart it either by holding down the power button or using command+control+power button.  <comment273795> If you feel the need you can force restart your computer using Command-Control-Eject/Power Button <comment273819> Ok. I fixed. Thank you. But can you explain why it stopped ? now all works well, but I have some problems with my icloud account. It shows me that I used all storage and havent any space there, after deleting big information from icloud drive same message appears. <comment273863> @Gor Afraid I don't know.
