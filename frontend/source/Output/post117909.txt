iOS apps for viewing generic map files <body> What are the iOS map-viewing apps that are compatible with the largest number of file formats for topographic maps and trail maps? (such as those found on the USGS website)  I'm really looking for a no-bells-and-whistles mapping "swiss army knife" app that's LOW on branding and not trying to sell me maps.  <answer120243> It looks like Maps n Trax could help:     With [it] you can view your own maps on your own iPhone instead of   just generic online maps or a limited selection of maps chosen by   somebody else. […] for specialist maps with details that are not   available on other mapping applications, such as highly detailed   topographic maps […].   From the description, this looks like something you could use. An user guide can be found here. NB: im am not affiliated with them.
