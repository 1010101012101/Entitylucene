Blank page removal tool for PDF? <body> A command line tool is preferred, but not required.  Do you know of any strongautomatable/strong tool that can automatically detect and remove blank pages from a multi-page PDF file?  <answer72099> Here are a few tools I found on the web. I haven't used them, so I can't comment on how well they might work for you.  strongA-PDF Scan Optimizer/strong has an option for detecting and removing pages with not many visible marks.  the CoolUtils strongTIFF PDF Cleaner/strong "detects blank pages in TIFF and PDF files and deletes them".   Edocfile's strongBlank Page Remover/strong has the effect of deleting blank pages from a PDF file, though it's intended for use with a scanner and a printer as a way of converting a document with mixed single- and double-sided sheets into a document with all single- or double-sided sheets.   Axpertsoft's strongPDF Page Remover/strong can remove blank pages from multiple PDF files at a single command.  All these requires Windows of some flavour, so I hope you have a virtual machine on your Mac.  <comment83686> By "blank", do you mean "completely empty", or "no visible marks", or "not many visible marks"? For instance, imagine a page with exactly one text character on itâ€”a space character. It would have no visible marks, but would not be completely empty. Or feed a blank piece of paper into a scanner which generates PDF files. The PDF file would have an image of a blank piece of paper, likely with some light grey spots or flecks due to tricks of light and dust. Would that page be "blank"? The distinction matters a lot for how a page removal tool would detect whether a page is "blank". <comment84546> By "blank" I mean "not many visible marks."  See this thread where I posted a link to a scan of a "blank" page.   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5245785/detecting-empty-pages-in-scanned-documents/13185209#13185209
