Preventing an app from retrieving iCloud data <body> I have an app that was previously downloaded on a different device but on the new device, I don't want that data, I just want to start from scratch. How can I prevent an app from retrieving that backed up iCloud data?  <comment267407> Which specific app are you talking about here?
