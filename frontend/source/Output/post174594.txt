iOS Simulator cannot create devices after upgrading to Xcode 6 <body> I just recently upgraded to XCode 6.1.1 from 5.1.1.  When I launch iOS Simulator.  I get an error "Unable to boot device in current state: Creating".  I have tried deleting the devices and adding them back manually.  But that is to no avail.  I have reinstalled XCode as well after uninstalling and cleaning my Library and Preferences folders.  That also has not worked.  I am not sure if there are artifacts left over from 5.1.1 that are causing this.  Does anyone know what the root cause/solution is?  Please Advise  <answer174616> What do you find when you go to XCode  Preferences  Downloads?  You may need to update the simulators within this preference.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ufoBj.png" alt="xcode downloads"  <answer174655> This error can happen if you renamed Xcode.app.  I suggest you do the following:  ol liQuit Xcode.app, iOS Simulator.app, etc./li liExecute: sudo killall -9 com.apple.CoreSimulator.CoreSimulatorService/li liExecute: rm -rf ~/Library/*/CoreSimulator/li liReboot and try again./li /ol
