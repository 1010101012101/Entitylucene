Boot Camp 5 drivers not installing on Windows 8 (iMac) <body> So I have a mid-2010 iMac 22" that I just installed Windows 8 on, but cannot get the Boot Camp 5 drivers to install.  I was unaware that my mid-2010 iMac was technically unsupported for the Windows 8, but the Boot Camp assistant native to my OSX successfully installed it anyways. I know that the Apple support pages say that it is unsupported but when I look at what the specs are needed to run Windows 8 (on the Windows 8 support pages) my machine qualifies.  I haven't done much with the Windows partition as of yet, but so far it seems to run fine. So my question is:  ol liIs it possible for me to not install any drivers, and safely use the Windows 8?/li /ol  or  ol liCan we work around the "Boot Camp 5 isn't supported on this Mac" and install the Boot Camp 5 drivers?/li /ol  <answer96914> They don't support it because they want you to use their software  <comment113719> Your machine has the technical specifications to run Windows 8, but it lacks the driver support from Apple. That's what they meant that windows 8 isn't supported.
