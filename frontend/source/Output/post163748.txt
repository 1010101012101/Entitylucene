Script to remove image orientation <body> I need to remove the orientation "flag" of a batch of images (jpeg images), without changing the displayed orientation of the images.  Trying to make it clear : if I have an image in portrait orientation with an orientation flag, I want it to keep this portrait orientation, but get rid of the orientation flag, as it seems some application are not able to handle it correctly. It's a kind of fusionning the image with its orientation flag.  I guess this means recompressing the image, but that is not a problem.  I tried to do it with automator, but was not able to do it. Is it possible ?  <answer163749> Can't offer an codeAutomator script/code but codeJhead/code which is a command line Jpeg header manipulation tool.  ol liDownload jhead/li liStart codeTerminal.app/code and move the file to code/usr/local/bin//code with    precodesudo mv ~/Downloads/jhead /usr/local/bin/jhead /code/pre  and enter your password/li liMake it executable codesudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jhead/code/li liEntering codejhead -v -norot ~/Pictures/folder/subfolder/*.jpg/code should do the job and clears the Exif header rotation tag without altering the image./li /ol  Here is the manual. Make a test with some pictures in a subfolder before you rot your original pictures.
