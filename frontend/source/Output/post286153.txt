Chrome Keeps on Asking to be the Default Browser <body> I have a customized default user profile, running on macOS 10.12.5 "Sierra." Prior to copying this profile over to English.lproj, I answered all of the first run prompts from Chrome and set it to be the default browser for macOS. Now, when a new user logs in for the first time, and runs Chrome, they get a prompt asking them to set Chrome as the default. This is stronghighly/strong irritating as this machine is in a computer lab. Every who uses the computer is logging in for the first time. Closing Chrome throws an error indicating no keychain could be found for Chrome. Has anyone seen this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/amdLA.png" alt="Seen at logoff"
