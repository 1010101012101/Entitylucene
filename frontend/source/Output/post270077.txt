iOS 10.2 not trusting enterprise developers <body> Since I've been installing third party apps that I trust onto my phone, going to SettingsGeneralProfiles and Device ManagentDeveloperVerify has been a routine. But after iOS 10.2, apps that I previously verified weren't working. I attempted to re verify them, but when I clicked verify, it said loading for a second and then didn't verify the apps. Is there anything I can do to fix this?
