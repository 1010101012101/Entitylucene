MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) keboard and trackpad are not working <body> As title suggests, keyboard and trackpad are not working. However, force quit (kbdshift/kbd+kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdalt/option/kbd+kbdpower/kbd) had worked.  Where is the problem and how can I fix it?  <answer260227> Well in layman's terms, your computer has crashed because of some  application overloading your memory(heap) or got stuck in some sort of infinit loop! That is why nothing works(its not just your mouse and keyboard, its everything) but when you press an intrupt key since it has a highr priority than normal processes it prevents CPU to continue the task and pops up tje force quit tab. Just figure out whaylt is choking your system via activity monitor and kill it.  <comment325696> Thanks for response Milad. But External keyboard and mouse have been working. <comment325699> Have you tried booting in [Safe Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262) to see if it's because something is loading that is causing the issue?  Hold Shift while booting.  Also, you may want to have your battery looked at as it may be swelling which would could cause the issue <comment325711> Yes, I tried. But still those are not working. <comment325712> Then it's most likely the top case.(keyboard and trackpad assembly) that is bad and needs to be replaced.  They keyboard and trackpad are USB devices;  plugging in an external one that works indicates there is no problem with that subsystem or with software.   You will either have to take it to be repaired or swap it out yourself unless you have Apple Care. <comment325713> Ok...Thanks for suggestion and quick response.
