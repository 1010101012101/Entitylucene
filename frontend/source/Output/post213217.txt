El Capitan - Macbook won't shut down without force quit and sometimes starts to blank screen <body> • My mid-2015 Macbook Pro Running 10.11.1 frequently will not shut down without holding the power button.   • It also sometimes starts up to a blank screen (with no apps or desktop items showing).  • I've run Disk Utilities to repair preferences, Diskwarrior 5 to build a new directory, rebuilt the NVRAM (PRAM) and the SMC, restarted from Recovery partition and no change.  I don't see this problem all over the internet and I'm just a little concerned.  Thanks,
