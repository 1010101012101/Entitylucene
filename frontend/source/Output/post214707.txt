Do deleted iPhone photos remain in the iCloud <body> Can I delete photos from my iPhone without losing the iCloud copies?  I am short of memory on my phone and want to free up space.  <answer214719> Deleting photos on your phone WILL delete the iCloud copy.  Instead open Settings  iCloud  photos and check the option "optimize iPhone storage".  This is supposed to allow the phone to have smaller photo files, while the original resolution is maintained in the iCloud copy.
