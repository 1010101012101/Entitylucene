How do I fix my camera on my iphone 4? <body> My camera on my iPhone 4 is showing nothing but a black screen. Front and rear camera and it happens in all camera related apps as well. When I reset my phone it fixes it, but the problem keeps reoccurring. How do I permanently fix the problem?  <answer184664> Is the phone jailbroken? If so, try running it not jailbroken for a while to see if the problem reoccurs.  Other than that, try an OS restore - just make sure you do a backup first.  <comment218962> you have a app that is interfering with it. <comment218963> would it be any app or camera apps only? <comment218964> any app that uses (or can use) camera/video calling...you need to find out which one, by turning them off (or uninstalling)
