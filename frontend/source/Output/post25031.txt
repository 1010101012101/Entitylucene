Emoticon keyboard on iphone, not emoji <body> How to have a keyboard that presents shortcuts for common ascii emoticons?  I specifically do NOT want anything that uses the emoji unicode symbols. But instead a keyboard that provides shortcuts for the standard emoticons such as code:-)/code, code:-(/code, code;-)/code, codeB-)/code, code:-*/code, code&lt;3/code, and so on.  Update: so far, it seems there is no way to do what I ask for. So I asked a more specific question asking for SMS apps that support ASCII emoticons.  <answer25033> As Apple doesn't allow for third-party keyboards outside of apps, you'd have to find (or make) an app that does what you want and design your own keyboard to do that.  <answer115989> You can set up shortcuts under Settings &rarr; General &rarr; Keyboards &rarr; Shortcuts.br For example you could set up a shortcut as follows:  phrase = code:-]/codebr shortcut = codesml/code  <answer166559> If you add Japanese Kana or Chinese simplified keyboards there is a smiley face button with a bunch of ascii art smiley faces, but they're not exactly the "standard emoticons" that you refer to.  Eg.  (T_T)\(^-^)  <comment28191> There isn't an official door that apple has provided to make this possible. You could jailbreak the device (generally not my cup of tea) or use some composition app like [TextExpander](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textexpander/id326180690?mt=8) to do the job and then paste the results using the clipboard. A poor solution for snippets as short as you propose, but the best option I currently see to your dilemma. <comment222065> This was correct at the time, but now Apple does allow third party keyboards.
