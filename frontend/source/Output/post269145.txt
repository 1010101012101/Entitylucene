BambooCore wants to make changes in my macos. Is it safe? What is this? <body> I need some help. Recently I have this message appearing each time I start my MacOS: "BambooCore wants to make changes". I don't remember I've ever installed anything like BambooCore. Is it safe? What is this? I tried to google it but there is no straight answer on this question. It shows up under a graphic tablet (never had one) or mouse controller. Did you have a similar experience? How to remove this? I can't find it in apps. Thanks  Edit: The previous owner of this MacBook may have had a Wacom tablet, but I don't know how to remove this software and stop it asking for permission to make changes in the system.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NOk8J.png" alt="BambooCore wants to make changes"  <comment338084> Do you have a Wacom tablet? <comment338161> A piece of advice... if you purchased a MacBook (any computer for that matter) and it hasn't been wiped, you should do so yourself.  You don't want to inherit any problems whether they be malicious or not. <comment338221> I've figured out - it may be a graphic tablet and it probably is. The thing is - I've installed it a long time ago on my previous macbook and migrated to new one. I have removed the app, so the question is - why does it ask me for access? it shouldn't be present. I can't find the way to remove this bamboo core thing. Any thoughts? Thanks <comment339028> OK found it somewhere. It was in user's folder, hidden
