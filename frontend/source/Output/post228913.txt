AD network drives and or apple script editor <body> I have a new Mac laptop. I have it on a Windows domain and I get my drive mapping in the sidebar when I login with my AD account. When I change my account to a mobile account I loose the mapping in the sidebar. I can get it back if I connect to server but anyone know how I can get it to stay?  I did some searching and I thought making an Apple Script would be the way to go. I am a total newbie when it comes to Script Editor but I got it to work fine when I have a network connection here at work. But if I take it home I'll of course get an error. So here is where I am stuck. I need help creating an "if exists" so if a user is at home when it tries to mount the volume it won't give an error message when it fails.  Here is what I have so far. When I press the hammer icon it doesn't come back with an error but when I press the play button it give me a "running" but disappears as soon as it says it.  precodetell application "Finder"     if exists "smb://abc/EmployeesHome" then         mount volume "smb://abc/EmployeesHome" as user name "username"     else (* do nothing *)     end if end tell /code/pre  Any help would be appreciated!
