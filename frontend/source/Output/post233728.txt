New SSD can't be initialized <body> I have an old Macbook Pro for which I bought a new SSD and replaced the HDD with the SSD. Can't go further, see below.  I really don't know what to do. I could  ol lireturn the SSD which, finally, might be broken/li liuse a Linux distrib and gparted or fdisk, but the partition table they generate are not OS X compatible, I heard... Tell me which distrib I should put on my USB stick (GRML, Ubuntu,...)/li /ol  Booted to both Recovery strongand/strong El Capitan off a USB 64Gb Stick.

Why not reseat the HDD and see that the Mac boots or not. Then reseat the SSD. At that point, you'll have a repeatable scenario and can go about building up something that works or know that the Mac needs hardware service or a new cable perhaps or just had a failure at the same time as you swapped unrelated hardware.  <answer233732> Since you are booting off a Recovery/Install USB you should have no problems erasing and partitioning your drive for use in your MBP.  There are a couple things that could be the issue here:  ol liThe drive is defective.  It doesn't happen often but it does./li liThe SATA cable got damaged./li /ol  Do you have an old drive you can try swapping the SSD out with to see if the problem continues?  If it does, the problem is your MBP; and most likely the cable as this is the component most people damage inadvertently.  If not the cable then there is an issue with your MBP  or..  If you have a USB enclosure, you can try formatting and partitioning the drive attached to USB.  If it fails there - you know it's the drive.  If it works, then the issue is with your MBP (again, most likely the cable).  I use this adapter from Anker when working with "questionable" drives as it supports both 2.5" (laptop) and 3.5" (desktop) drives.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rdd0hm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer233735> The error message may indicate that the SSD contains an MBR which can't be properly repartitioned to a GUID partition table.  I recommend to dd the partition table with zeros:  ul liBoot to the thumb drive/li liGet the number of blocks of the drive with   precode#get the device node of the SSD (probably /dev/disk0) diskutil list #replace diskX by the device node you got in the last command #below I assume the device node is /dev/disk0 gpt -r -v show /dev/disk0 /code/pre/li liUnmount the SSD  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre/li liWrite zeros to the MBR  precode#Get the sector or device block size (either 512 or 4096!) diskutil info /dev/disk0 #write zeros to the first blocks dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=4096 count=8 #write zeros to the last blocks #if the logical block size or sectorsize is 4096 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=4096 count=8 seek=(number of blocks(4096)-8) #or if the logical block size or sectorsize is 512 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=4096 count=8 seek=(number of blocks(512)-64) /code/pre  Example: if you got  precodediskutil info disk0 ...
