Can I change my 2011 iMac's graphic card from AMD's to nvidia Quadro? <body> I do lot of video editing work, mostly on FCP &amp; Avid and I feel Quadro card is way to go. Do you think I can get it changed from Apple?  -Reddy  <answer16353> I don't even think the hardware would be compatible. Quite frankly, while you can open up the system and tinker with it, you have to worry about two things:  ol liForm factor - The card is probably a different shape. Apple partners with other companies when designing a system and the fact that they put an ATI in there says something about the engineering of the machine./li liPower &amp; bus interface - These are likely less of an issue, but something to be aware of./li /ol  The iMac is a turnkey system, not an upgradable machine, like the Mac Pro (or, emgasp/em, a PC). I'm sorry that this is not the answer you want to hear, but I don't think that Apple will do it. That said, it can't hurt to ask.  <answer191622> Some cards can be made to work in OS X with custom ROM, however, OS X extensions do not support the card's hardwired device ID, so it would result in a Kernel Panic at boot. If the card is close to another officially supported card in OS X or use the same GPU, there's an easy hack which will allow it to operate in OS X.  h3NVIDIA Quadro 4/h3  This card is very close to GeForce 4 Ti series, using same GPU and PCB layout. Some even have dual DVI outputs.  Custom GeForce 4 Ti ROM will make the card work as a Mac Card, but a Kernel Panic will happen every time you try to boot with original NVIDIA extensions.  To begin you'll need to:  ul lifind the hardware Device ID of your card/li lihave your card flashed and working with a Mac ROM, you can test your card in OS 9 (currently available ROM for Quadro 4 700 XGL)/li lihave an editor capable of modifying plist files./li /ul  For the Quadro 4 700 XGL  ul liDevice ID of the card is 025B (Quadro 4 700 XGL) 10DE (NVIDIA)/li liROM is available online/li liQuadro 4 / GeForce 4 Ti series will use 2 OS X extensions to operate.  First is codeNVDAResman.kext/code (used by every NVIDIA card), second is codeNVDANV20Hal.kext/code (specific kernel extension for GeForce 4 series / NV2x GPUs)/li /ul  hr  h3Before physically installing your Mac flashed card, let's proceed with the Extensions hack./h3  ol liGo to your root disk (OS X installation) and go to folder code/System/Library/Extensions/code/li liBack up the extensions you're going to modify (here codeNVDAResman.kext/code and codeNVDANV20Hal.kext/code). Keep one copy of each in a safe place, and one copy of each in your desktop. Last 2 copies are going to be edited./li liRight-Click on the first extension you copied on your desktop and use "show package content" option. The extension will open as a classic folder./li liOpen the "Contents" folder and Open the file Info.plist with your editor./li liSearch for string codeIOPCIMatch/code and add your card's device ID.  Save the file and proceed to do the same with the second extension./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GSPrl.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="6" liCopy the edited extensions packages to code/System/Library/Extensions/code/li liOpen the Disk Utility application and run the repair permissions utility on your drive./li liNow install the card, and reboot your computer./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgowu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Credit: http://themacelite.wikidot.com/kext-mod  <comment17862> They will say no. That is all. <comment17863> My instinct says Apple would not respond to my questions as they have no option for graphic cards other than 2 AMD models. Guess I should stick to stock cards. Thanks anyway Mosche.
