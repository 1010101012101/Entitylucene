Can I sync Notes to and from a secondary iCloud account? <body> I have my work iCloud account that needs to be primary for Keynote collaboration etc.   But all most Notes are in my personal iCloud account. I can use my personal iCloud account for iMessages and iTunes, is there a way to also use my personal iCloud account for notes?   Did a bit of searching and found this answer - Notes from iCloud account don&#39;t sync with devices when added as secondary account - that is a bit confusing with the various upgrades downgrades of OS. I am on all the latest OS versions.   <answer281317> I'd try (no guarantee) to connect the secondary iCloud via the "Others" button in the mail settings, where you'd have to put in the imap/smtp-server-adress from iCloud.   You can find these here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202304  After that you can enable the Notes and deactivate Mail. The best way to find out is over trial and error although it takes up time...  <comment353980> Is having a separate account on your Mac for personal and work an option?  Both can be running together with easy switching between them.
