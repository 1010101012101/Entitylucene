How can I tell Music for iPad to play all of an artist's songs without making a playlist? <body> I want to play all of an artist's songs that I have, on multiple albums. Making a playlist seems overkill. This was never an issue in iOS 4, as there was a track-shaped option for shuffle play.  Please note that I want something that emalways/em works, so simply "pressing play while on an artist's page" won't do the trick as sometimes a song is currently "playing" already.  I'm running iOS 5.1.  <answer53068> Select the artist of choice, then hit the play button. Selecting a song in any of the albums plays only that album.  <answer202022> Not obvious at all, but:   ul liTap codeMy Music/code from bottom nav./li liTap the red filter menu selection that's located roughly upper central on the screen, just below the codeRecently Added/code section.   ul liThe filter menu should say codeArtists/code or codeAlbums/code or codeSongs/code etc. Choose your desired filter option (codeArtists/code in this case). /li liThe list items below the filter will update. /li /ul/li listrongTap the list item's avatar/strong (emtap the artist photo/em, in this case). strongDo not tap the list item's text/strong (emthe artist's name/em), unless you want instead to navigate into sublists. /li liA queue will begin playing from your selection.   ul liIf you already had a queue, the old queue will be replaced with this new queue. /li liThe first song in the queue will not be random, even if you had shuffle enabled. /li /ul/li liAn almost-too-skinny-to-tap bar will appear at the bottom of your screen.   ul liTap it to view the current song, to access shuffle and continuous buttons, and to preview the queue (menu icon to the right of the fast-forward button). /li /ul/li liComplain to http://apple.com/feedback. /li /ul  <comment49169> I assume you excluded the only option available. At least that's what I usually do: Navigate to the artist, select "All Songs" and then "Shuffle"... <comment49179> @Patrix That only worked in iOS 4 and earlier, in iOS 5, there's no option to do that. "This was never an issue in iOS 4, as there was a track-shaped option for shuffle play." <comment49183> Hmm, probably I'm not understanding what you want to accomplish. See http://d.pr/CLmV for a way which works for me in iOS 5.x. <comment49186> That's where it was in iOS 4, but it's not there on an iPad :( <comment49188> Seems to have gone indeed (didn't realize your question was iPad related). <comment60735> Ahem. "Please note that I want something that always works, so simply 'pressing play while on an artist's page' won't do the trick as sometimes a song is currently 'playing' already."
