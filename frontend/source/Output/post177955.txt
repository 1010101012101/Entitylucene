Can I use a large external hard drive both as installation media and backup drive? <body> I am planning to upgrade my Mid 2010 13" Macbook Pro to Yosemite from Snow Leopard, on a new SSD hard drive.  Being more experienced now with UNIX/Mac, I want to have a clean install to get rid of the beginner cruft I had built up. My idea of a backup is simply a basic copy/paste of my Home folder (about 130GB). Here's my plan:  ol liUsing Disk Utility, partition my new 500GB external hard drive into two parts. One for my Home folder backup, and the other for the installation media./li liCopy my Home folder to the backup partition on the external hard drive./li liUse codecreateinstallmedia/code on the other partition. Tutorial here./li liInstall my new SSD./li liPlug in my external hard drive. Hold down Option key when turning on the computer, and proceed from there./li /ol  Does that sound like a good plan? My apprehension is that the two-partition setup on my external hard drive might corrupt my backup data, given that I also set it up as a bootable installer media.  <answer177964> I can speak from experience - I've got a 32GB USB drive, 8GB of which are a Yosemite installer and 24GB of which are normal storage. It works perfectly!
