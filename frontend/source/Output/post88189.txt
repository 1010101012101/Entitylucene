Why does Apple's website break with 2o7.net blocked? <body> I have an code/etc/hosts/code block on 2o7.net and it seems that Apple's metrics.apple.com is a DNS alias for 2o7. When navigating apple.com with Chrome or Safari, I get the following:  precodeFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)  http://metrics.apple.com/b/ss/appleglobal,appleusmac,appleusmacbookpro/1/H.â€¦er%3BQuickTime%20Plug-in%207.7.1%3BSharePoint%20Browser%20Plug-in%3B&amp;AQE=1 /code/pre  Whenever I get this message Javascript seems to break and pretty much even link on the site is ignored. I'm not sure if this is a browser bug.   I don't want to unblock 2o7.net but would obviously like the site to work. Any ideas?  <answer88194> codedig metrics.apple.com/code gives  precode;; ANSWER SECTION: metrics.apple.com.  4107    IN  CNAME   appleglobal.112.2o7.net. appleglobal.112.2o7.net. 249    IN  A   66.235.133.14 appleglobal.112.2o7.net. 249    IN  A   66.235.138.2 ... /code/pre  so you could try to dynamically update your codehosts/code file every hour or so:  precodegrep -v metrics.apple.com /etc/hosts &gt; /tmp/raw-hosts echo $(dig metrics.apple.com |         grep ^appleglobal |         head -1 | cut -c 35-) metrics.apple.com appleglobal.112.2o7.net &gt;&gt; /tmp/raw-hosts mv /tmp/raw-hosts /etc/hosts /code/pre  <comment103213> These IPs invariably change often, the nature of a CDN. <comment103218> Ah, good point.
