"Command not found" when attempting to cd in Terminal <body> I am getting errors trying to set up web starter kit via Terminal. I get an error trying to install the kit: code$ cd web-starter-kit $ npm install/code returns code-bash: $: command not found./code  How do I get this to work?  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeDavids-iMac-3:~ david$ git clone https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit.git Cloning into 'web-starter-kit'... remote: Counting objects: 4397, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (102/102), done. remote: Total 4397 (delta 12), reused 81 (delta 3) Receiving objects: 100% (4397/4397), 7.15 MiB | 196.00 KiB/s, done.

That is why bash is saying it can't find the code$/code command.  For example, try just codecd web-starter-kit/app/code instead of code$ cd web-starter-kit/app/code.  <answer140509> The first strong$/strong in the command should not be typed.  It represents the unix prompt.  So, instead of  precode$ cd web-starter-kit/app /code/pre  you should use  precodecd web-starter-kit/app /code/pre  <answer140553> Already answered above but just give a little more context - the error message tells you what is wrong:  precode-bash: $: command not found /code/pre  for instance:  precodePROMPT&gt; foo -bash: foo: command not found /code/pre  Often README files or tutorials will prefix commands with a '$' to indicate whatever you have as your UNIX prompt. You're not meant to type them.
