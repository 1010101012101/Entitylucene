How to launch Google Drive in another user's session? <body> This is basically a follow up of a very similar broader question.  Say I have two users, strongfoo/strong and strongbar/strong. Only strongfoo/strong is logged in. If I manually log strongbar/strong in I could set up Google Drive to auto start under emSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Items/em. In fact, it's probably already set up there, and this is what I currently do to achieve what I want: have 2 google drive sessions running simultaneously on my machine.  But, without this, how could I launch it without switching users from strongfoo/strong? And would it be possible to launch it even without logging in strongbar/strong? If not, how could I automate logging in strongfoo/strong and strongbar/strong after reboot? I'm just looking for ways to automate this process (of having to login another user) and keep Drive working even after eventual random failures.  Now, the similar question does have a very intersting answer suggesting using codelaunchd's bsexec/code and a trampoline-like process on strongbar/strong, which would be quite complicated to achieve even with a script. And it does say "emApple Engineers do not recommend its general use/em", whatever that means.  If it were dropbox, I could be using dropbox cli. But Drive doesn't have such an option...  <comment162104> why is it necessary to have simultaneous fobar using Google drive on a single computer ? <comment162105> @Buscar웃 think different, huh? I just want to keep my work and home google drive in sync with my personal computer. But I could as well simply want to run 2 simultaneous GUI applications which have some useful background process but no command line version. IMHO, "why is doing such thing so complicated?" would be a much better question. <comment162107> I have 2 Google (accounts) drives, and did not think of using them both as same time, but ?? let me try. <comment162108> OK, I did it and it works. <comment162110> @Buscar웃 what you mean? Using just 1 mac user-account?! I can't connect to a second drive account without disconnecting the first here. <comment162111> I used 2 Google Drives at same time on one computer. But i cheated, I used the web version only (with 2 browsers), not the installed versions. <comment162146> The GDriveFS project may make this possible: https://github.com/dsoprea/GDriveFS and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10306252/google-drive-with-fuse
