iCloud for Automator and services <body> Since Mavericks, Automator is now able to store services (.workflow) in iCloud.  The problem is that services are not available in the Services menu or contextual menu (right-click) when I store them that way.  Am I missing something? I don't see the point of iCloud for Automator if I have to duplicate the services to ~/Library/Services in order to use them.  <answer117821> You can save services anywhere, not just iCloud or the correct Service location. Because of this, I used to save services in my Dropbox and symlink them on multiple Macs. With the advent of iCloud, I use this instead, saving my services in iCloud then symlinking them on multiple machines.  Also, iCloud in Automator is not just for services â€” it'll sync all the Automator files, including workflows and applications.  <answer218994> I created an alias to the Services folder in iCloud Drive so I can simply duplicate and drag the Automator file. It's not the most elegant solution but the best I came up with.  <comment137619> So I have to symlink the iCloud services to the ~/Library/Services folder to use them? I don't know how to do that... But I'd thought that iCloud-stored services were used by default by OSX. <comment187280> I do agree with Ashen, this answer leaves much unanswered. I tried the symlink trick, but it seems to only work if I symlink *each* service to the ~/Services folder individually. That can't be right. Of course I can just replace the original ~/Services with a symlink, but that isn't very elegant, is it? And I'd really love to know what use it is to have the option to save on iCloud Drive, when these Services can't be used. <comment244047> Using a short link doesn't work. Probably symlink would be the only sync solution there. I decided to just copy (drag n' drop) and the heck with it!
