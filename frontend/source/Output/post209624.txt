How to fix homebrew error: "invalid active developer path" after upgrade to OS X El Capitan? <body> I get this error when I run codebrew update/code:  precode$ brew update xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun Error: Failure while executing: git checkout -q master /code/pre  How to fix this issue?  <answer209625> Run the following commands to fix the above error  precodesudo xcode-select --install sudo xcode-select -switch / /code/pre  I found the answer on https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/23500  I also had to do this:  precodesudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local /code/pre  Because of some permission issues. However, do this only if you have to.  <answer209651> Only the following command should resolve the issue if you are the admin on the machine.  precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  The following article helped me solve the issue  http://tips.tutorialhorizon.com/2015/10/01/xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path-library-developer-commandline-tools-missing-xcrun/  <comment255623> I had to add `sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/` instead of just `sudo xcode-select -switch /` but otherwise this worked great. No need for me to chown the files though. <comment258223> Worked like a charm. Thank you so much for the quick fix.This all seems to be due to El Capitan's new security features. <comment309435> This worked for me, but strangely, it took a couple of minutes after doing this before `brew doctor` stopped failing. <comment322053> This advice has nearly set my desk on fire. My macbook has had the CPU pinned for 10 minutes. WTF is this doing? My fault for trusting commands without understanding them. Others be warned. I now appear to have a bunch of zombie/hydra `xcodebuild` processes <comment348277> It's obvious in hindsight, but I missed it at first: I needed to restart my shell after doing `sudo xcode-select --install`. <comment350388> I too had to do all 3 commands listed above to get it working. Thx.
