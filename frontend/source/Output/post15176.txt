How do I change the OS X Mouse Pointer's color? <body> I have some visual impairment, and I often have problems finding my mouse pointer on the screen.  I want to change the color of the pointer.  I know in "Universal Access" you can change the size, but it still doesn't help that the cursor 'blends in' with everything else on my screen.  I want to make my cursor bright green or red.  I'm using OS X 10.6.7.  <answer15186> I think this application may help you:  h2Mousepos√©/h2  <answer23237> strikeAnything that allows you to change the color is paid software. Here's MightyMouse./strikebr Unfortunately, it looks like MightyMouse has been discontinued :(  I would recommend this strongemfree/em/strong software that displays a circle around your cursor. When you haven't moved your mouse for awhile and you move it, it'll display a circle around the pointer. Here's the software.  <answer108038> Try Omnidazzle you can not change the color, like I want to but you can see a thing round the mouse to find it by pressing a key. Try it.  <comment25922> This is very convenient, free, and user friendly. I wish it was 64 bit, but it does run just fine in Lion.  Wonderful. <comment63712> this doesn't actually change the color of the cursor bout it is a great way to find out where the cursor is. you can get iCursor for free on the mac app store <comment126699> Can you provide links or screenshots that clearly identify why the OP would want to use this program? <comment332464> this doesn't really answer the question.
