Connect two monitors to MacBook 4,1 <body> All I can find on the internet is info on MacBook Pros. I have a regular MacBook, model 4,1, with a Mini DVI and a Fire Wire port. Currently I'm connecting an external monitor using a Mini DVI to HDMI converter.  Is it possible to connect two monitors to a MacBook 4,1 (Snow Leopard), using either a combo of Mini DVI and Firewire, or a splitter on either port?  <answer169991> According to EveryMac that machine can only support one external monitor, at 1920x1200 resolution.
