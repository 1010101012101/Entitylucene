Exclude sub-folders from Finder search <body> How can I force Finder to only search the current folder, ignoring the contents of all the sub-folders?br I don't want to exclude the sub-folders permanently from Spotlight, just for a certain search.  The reason I want to do this is that I sometimes have a folder with sub-folders that contain files/folders that are identically named. A simplified example is shown below:  precodemain | |-config.txt | |-folder 1 |  | |  |-config.txt | |-folder 2    |    |-config.txt /code/pre  When I'm in codemain/code and hit kbdCMD/kbd+kbdF/kbd and type codeconfig.txt/code I get three files. I don't want to click every file to see which one is in codemain/code and which in another folder, so ideally the sub-folders wouldn't show up in this search.  <answer97470> Possible workaround, although this doesn't emreally/em answer the question.  Not sure if there's a built-in option for this.  ol liIn list view, make sure all folders are collapsed --cmd-a (select all) and command-left-arrow are shortcuts for this./li liemWithout/em selecting the search box or using cmd-f, begin typing the name of the file "config.txt" and this will select that file in your current directory./li /ol  <answer97484> ol liThere is a product called Path Finder 6 that offers a feature called "filters and selections," demonstrated here./li liYou could try selecting all the items in the folder you are searching and applying a Label, then perform a Spotlight search for your item "AND" the additional criteria of "file label" by holding down the option key while clicking on the plus sign./li /ol  <answer97657> Use Unix find as follows  precodefind . -maxdepth 1 -name config.txt -print /code/pre  In Terminal, type codeman find/code for details.  If you do this often, you can make it into a shell function.  <comment114274> Interesting question, wonder why ! <comment114318> I've been wondering the same thing.  Cmd-option-f gives access to some more search options but excluding subfolders doesn't seem available.
