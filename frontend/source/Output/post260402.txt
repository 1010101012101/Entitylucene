Automate moving .eml files to Mail folder <body> I am regularly moving emails from one system to another using .eml files to archive them. (I can't simply forward them to myself as one of the systems is off the network.)  What I would like to do is, on the receiving system, have some sort of automation to move any .eml files dropped on a Finder folder into a related folder within Mail.app. Are there any tools that do that? (Automator service, Apple Script?)
