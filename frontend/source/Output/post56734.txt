Spaces and some other fonts are changed to rectangles? <body> I installed Microsoft Office 2011 yesterday on my MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard. I already had Microsoft Office 2008 on this device and simply added 2011. Now for some reason, many of my fonts have changed to rectangles as if I don't have the fonts installed. Also when I am in Mac Mail, the spaces are replaced with rectangles with "A" inside of them.  How can I fix this? Has anyone had a similar experience?  If you need more information from me, feel free to comment.  strongSOLVED:/strong  I used the Terminal command:  precodesudo atsutil databases -remove; sudo atsutil server -shutdown; sudo atsutil server -ping /code/pre  This cleared the cache and resolved the problem.  You could also use Lion Cache Cleaner or CleanMyMac to clear the cache and restore all the fonts.  NOTE: Make sure to open the "Font Book" application and make sure you resolve all duplicate fonts. Right-Click on the fonts with a small yellow attention sign beside it and click "Resolve Duplicate". This can also cause problems.  Gave credit to @da4 and @lri for there answer.  <answer56751> Try cleaning your font caches - the simplest way is to use a maintenance utility such as Lion Cache Cleaner.  <comment65188> `sudo atsutil databases -remove; sudo atsutil server -shutdown; sudo atsutil server -ping` would be even simpler.
