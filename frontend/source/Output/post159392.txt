Terminal command to delete all images in folder and subfolders? <body> I need a terminal command to delete all images (*.jpg, *.png, *.gif, *.JPG, *.PNG, *.GIF) stored in myfolder and its subfolders, preserving the folders structure. I do not need to move them to trash folder.  I guess that some regular expressions are needed, but this overcomes my skills.  <answer159394> To just list them (for review/verification):  precodefind MYFOLDER -type f \( -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.gif' \) -ls /code/pre  To move them to the Trash:  precodefind MYFOLDER -type f \( -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.gif' \) -exec mv '{}' ~/.Trash/ \; /code/pre  To delete them directly (no way to get them back unless you have a backup):  precodefind MYFOLDER -type f \( -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.gif' \) -delete /code/pre  <comment187419> There's also -delete as on option <comment187437> Indeed, thanks!
