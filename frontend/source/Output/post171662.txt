Burn DVD from MacbookPro Retina on a PC? <body> I just finished editing a 2hr HD video interview of an oral history about a famous artist on my 2012 MacbookPro retina running OSX 10.8.4. And now I'm being asked to put it on DVD (not what the original delivery method was going to be).   I'm working in Adobe Premiere Pro, and ideally I would like to use the adobe dynamic link to build my DVD in Encore. Is there a way that I can burn directly to the DVD burner on my Windows PC?  <comment202315> I don't know your software, but if you can output as an .iso image, the PC can burn that. <comment202342> That's what I ended up doing, but I still want to know if there's a way I can link with a DVD drive on a PC. <comment202344> doubt it - the one wouldn't know how to drive the other. <comment333553> Possible duplicate of [How to burn a dvd on 10.8](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128909/how-to-burn-a-dvd-on-10-8)
