kate editor with built-in terminal <body> For programming it is very convenient to have a built-in terminal inside a text editor. Therefore my favorite text editor on KDE-Linux is kate which has great ability of a built-in terminal below the text which is synchronized with the text path. Navigating through the open files and do terminal commands with them is then extremely easy.  I have installed kate via macport on OS X 10.10, but the terminal does not appear even though it shows its icon. Any idea if this a a kate bug or 10.10? If kate is not fully compatible with OS, is there any other text editor on Mac with a built-in terminal?  Thanks!   <answer207142> I don't know about Kate, but with emacs you can do : codeAlt + X - Shell/code and you have a terminal inside a text editor inside a terminal :)  https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/running-shells-in-emacs-overview  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VdM5h.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment249804> Thank you very much! I found however how to fix kate to show the terminal. <comment249805> I found the solution and the problem with kate is explained here: https://trac.macports.org/wiki/KDE and based on it one has to launch Kbuildsycoca. Then the terminal appears, but still kate on OS is not as robust as on Linux. <comment249813> So you don't join the emacs cult ? :( Outch' <comment249944> emacs always has been tricky for me..never really tried it :)
