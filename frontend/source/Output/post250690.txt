How to connect a wireless Apple keyboard to a Mac laptop with broken keyboard? <body> I have a Mac laptop with some keys not working. The login password includes some letters of the broken keys, therefore I have no way to login. Today I bought a wireless Apple keyboard but still got stuck at the login screen. It seems I have to login before I can peer the wireless keyboard to the laptop. So is there any way to get the wireless keyboard to peer with the laptop with broken keyboard? Thanks.
