RetinaPad equivalent for MacBook Pro Retina? <body> Is there anything like RetinaPad for the MacBook Pro Retina?  Essentially, it would be something that would automate the process of setting codeNSHighResolutionCapable/code to codetrue/code so that text would render properly, even if all the graphics aren't updated yet.  If this doesn't exist, would it be something that could be accomplished using codeSIMBL/code?  <answer83113> It sounds like Retinizer might be what you're looking for. It's reversible, works on a per app/per user basis, and doesn't require you to edit the codeInfo.plist/code files directly. I don't have an MBP, so I can't test it myself, but the pictures look pretty :)
