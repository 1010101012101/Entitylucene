2008 MBP Not Powering On <body> I'm hoping someone here might have some insight into an issue we've been having with our 2008 MBP.  I went to power it on one morning with no luck.  The screen doesn't power on and I don't get the Apple boot tone.  It briefly sounds like the optical drive is starting to spin and the front LED lights up, then it just powers down again.  I've tried booting it with and without a power supply with the same results.  I had checked a couple of forums where some people had similar issues and it was suggested that the RAM might be bad, so I tried replacing the RAM.  If I remove the RAM entirely, I get a loud beeping tone every few seconds, but when I put the RAM back in (old or new), it goes back to the previous issue.  Any thoughts on what could be wrong?  <comment192529> It sounds like RAM. I had similar issues with the same model. Try with a single RAM stick, swapping to find if this is the cause. Depending on RAM size, you might not be able to do much, but it should prove hardware.
