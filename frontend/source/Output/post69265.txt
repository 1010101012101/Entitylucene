iPhone playlist changes <body> I've deleted playlists in my iTunes, but I can't get rid of them on my iPhone.br I've tried syncing it but this doesn't work.  Nor does it re-sync them back to iTunes to try and delete again - they just appear stuck on the phone. How do I remove them from my phone?  <comment80509> Have you tried deleting them directly on your iPhone?
