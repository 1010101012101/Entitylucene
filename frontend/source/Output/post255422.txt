Known graphic issue (single-user-mode terminal error) <body> I'm trying to fix the known graphic issue for some MacBooks build earlier. I need to remove some files in another directory in the single-user-mode (kbdcmd/kbd+kbds/kbd).  When I try to remove a file to another directory I get this error:     Sandbox: mv(31) System Policy: deny(1) file-write-unlink /System/Library/Extensions/AMD6000Controller.kext mv: rename AMD6000Controller.kext to /DisabledExtensions/AMDController.kext: Operation not permitted   Here is what I did before:  precodelocalhost:/ root# mount -uw /  localhost:/ root# mkdir DisabledExtensions  localhost:/ root# cd System/Library/Extensions  localhost:/ root# mv AMD6000Controller.kext /DisabledExtensions /code/pre  Then I get the error above..  My MacBook won't boot, so I can only use the single-user-Mode to fix this problem..  What am I doing wrong?  Please help me..  <comment318072> I believe the filesystem is only mounted read-only at first when in single-user mode. You will have to mount it read-write. <comment318074> How? I'm not a pro in the terminal.. <comment318075> the command is `/sbin/mount -uw /`. Type `man mount` first for more information about mount. <comment318076> OH wait, I just noticed you did that already. <comment318078> I think the problem could be System Integrity Protection -- what version of OS X do you have? <comment318080> I think it's El Capitan 10.11.5 or 10.11.6 <comment318084> I know how to disable SIP in recovery mode but my macbook won't boot in recovery mode due to the graphic issue.. Is there a way to disable SIP in single-user-mode? <comment318176> Disable SIP and try again. (Enter recovery mode (cmd + R), open terminal, type csrutil disable, restart) <comment318221> @NoahL Super helpful tip, considering the OP's last comment (10 hours before yours) was they can't get into Recovery Mode in the first place... <comment318222> Codehan: The only place to disable SIP is in Recovery Mode, unfortunately. <comment318224> @Codehan can you boot into target disk mode? <comment318272> After hours I was able to boot in save mode (holding down shift while booting) for 5-10 minutes and disabled SIP in the terminal. After moving the files I had to reinstall the OS. It's working for now but I don't know if this is a permanent solution. My macbook is very slow, especially while booting. @tubedogg
