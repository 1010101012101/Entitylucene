Adding a photo to iPhoto by right clicking in the Finder <body> How does one add iPhoto to the list of choices when right clicking on a photo in the Finder?  <answer162558> You can create a custom service for Finder using Automator.app.  Open strongAutomator.app/strong located in /Applications/ folder by default.  When prompted to choose a document type, choose "Service".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f6jmS.png" alt="Automator Service"  On the top you will see a a box with drop downs.  Select strong"image files"/strong for the drop down box strong"Service receives selected"/strong and choose strong"Finder"/strong for the in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SqRhx.png" alt="Service selection"  Then on the left hand side with the strong"Actions"/strong tab selected choose strong"Photos"/strong then drag strong"Import Files into iPhoto"/strong into the workflow area to the right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dk3Hw.png" alt="Action Selector"  Configure the settings to where the photo will import into iPhoto.  The defaults are Existing album and Events.  Save your workflow and give it a name that will make it obvisous when you choose Services in the Right click menu.  (Ex.  "Import photo to iPhoto")  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBZLu.png" alt="right click service"  Services you create from Automator are saved in the path: strong~/Library/Services//strong  <comment190269> Thanks a lot.
