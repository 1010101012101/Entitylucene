Automator shell Script works, except inside dropbox <body> I used Automator to create a service that runs codepdf2svg/code from the context menu in Finder.   precodefor f in "$@" do     /opt/local/bin/pdf2svg $f ${f%.*}".svg" done /code/pre  It works fine, except it does not work on files stored in my dropbox folders.  How can I fix this?  <answer146967> If any of your files or folders in Dropbox happen to have spaces, your script will not behave as you expect.  You can fix that by adding quotes to the appropriate places like so:  precodefor f in "$@" do     /opt/local/bin/pdf2svg "$f" "${f%.*}.svg" done /code/pre  If that isn't the source of the problem, please update your question with more specifics as to what the behavior is that you see when you run this script manually from the command line.  <comment173203> What does "does not work" mean? Is it not visible in the context menu, does it run without output/result or something else?
