App Store wants to install Public Beta 3 but I’m no longer in the Beta Program? <body> I used to be in the beta program before Sierra came out, but I have since un-enrolled.  I don’t have the beta profile in my App Store settings as mentioned here but the App Store still wants to update me to 10.12.2 Public Beta 3. I am currently on 10.12.1 (stable).  Does anyone know how I can prevent the App Store from showing beta updates?  <answer261202> After you uninstall the Beta Profile, you need to reboot your device for the change to take effect.  <comment327089> @fsb no as this is for macOs and that will differ from iOS <comment327090> You're correct, @Mark, my mistake.  I'll delete it.
