Can I change the brightness on a secondary display? <body> I have a MBP with a secondary display. Is is possible to have the brightness keys (F1 &amp; F2) change both the main display (laptop screen) and the secondary display (a VGA external monitor connected via a Thunderbolt port with an adapter)? If not, is it possible to change the brightness on the secondary display?  <answer20238> Unfortunately, Macs don't have access to an external display's brightness settings. On most displays, that is only controllable using the physical buttons/menus on the display itself.  I agree that this would be a great feature to see, but it isn't really possible now to control brightness over the video cable.  Note that I can't speak for Apple's Cinema Display and Thunderbolt; I haven't tried that and it may be different.  <answer20307> If you're using an Apple Cinema Display it is possible to control brightness as long as you connect the display's USB cable to your Mac. The causes a "Brightness" slider to appear on the screen's control panel in "Displays" System Preferences. Unfortunately the F1 and F2 don't change the brightness settings on the external screen.  <answer20311> If you have an Apple Cinema display and are adjusting brightness via the "displays" preference pane, note that the preference pane will show up both on your main display (the cinema display) and on the MBP. It allows you to set the brightness separately.  <answer20321> One of my favorite tools for doing this is Shades which is "donationware."  You can adjust each monitor separately, and set keyboard shortcuts for them as well.  If you want a command line solution, I found brightness.c which compiled cleanly using:  precodegcc -std=c99 -o brightness brightness.c -framework IOKit -framework ApplicationServices /code/pre  (You'll need Xcode to be installed to compile it. If you want a precompiled version, mine is available here delhttp://share.luo.ma/askdifferent/20237//del )  It will let you set the brightness for either monitor.   UPDATE:  Note that this answer is several years old. The link above is now 404 but there is a newer tool available at http://github.com/nriley/brightness or `brew install screenbrightness`   <answer28474> If you press kbdControl/kbd-kbdF1/kbd or kbdControl/kbd-kbdF2/kbd the brightness on a secondary display will adjust. I have tested this on my MacBook Air 2011 13" and 27" Thunderbolt Display.  strongImportant notes:/strong You have to plug in the USB cable from the Display to the Macbook Pro in order that the keyboard shortcuts work. This only works on Apple Displays.  If you're using a MacBook with Touch Bar, this works for the "brighter"/"less bright" Touch Bar embuttons/em but strongNOT/strong for the Touch Bar brightness emslider/em.  <answer33005> I have 2 thunderbolt displays connected to my MBP. I had to connect only one display at a time in order to adjust the brightness. Then I reconnected them both and all was well. Too bad the control panel doesn't show the brightness slider on both displays but this is a simple solution.  <answer48620> If you press CTRL and F1/F2 the brightness on a secondary display will adjust. Tested and works on my MacBook Pro (Early 2011) 15" and 27" Thunderbolt Display.  <answer56982> If you run Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8, you can adjust brightness easily with Mac Brightness Control utility.  <answer61870> I have two screens connected to my Mac Pro. (This also works for MacBook Pro.) I have the USB on the first screen connected to the Mac. The second screen has its USB connected into the back of the first screen (the 2nd screen display adapter uses an extender to get to the Mac - you could likewise use a USB extender to get to the back of the Mac).  With both screens communicating to the Mac via screen as well as USB, kbdF1/kbd and kbdF2/kbd as brightness control the dimming of the first display, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF1/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF2/kbd control the second screen. No need to disconnect at all.  <answer82619> There are many answers here, but one wasn't mentioned (though it only has limited applicability---you need to have a second keyboard handy.)  When I have a second display hooked up to my MBP, emand/em a second keyboard plugged in, then the built-in laptop keyboard's function keys control the built-in (main) laptop LCD and the external keyboard's function keys work for the secondary.    In case it's changed, this is on 10.6.8.  <answer84060> Screen Dimmer isn't free ($2), but is the only tool I could find that handles multiple monitors (up to 3).   Seems nice and elegant the short time I've used it. Sits in menubar, and has a simple slider and monitor selector, as well as keybindings for brightness increase/decrease.  My 3 external displays are non-apple (1 Dell with displayport, 1 samsung with displayport-dvi, and 1 old acer 19" with hdmi-dvi) on a MacBook Pro Retina 15" with 10.8.2.  edit: For the OP's question this shouldn't matter, but fyi for 3 monitors - it seems to only allow one combination of monitors for dimming (i.e. can't dim completely separately -- this works for me as I use it to dim the 2 side monitors so they don't distract from the main middle monitor)  <answer90886> After experimenting with lots of hot keys I found a solution. I am using a dual screen setup with 27 inch iMac which is connected to a 27 inch Thunderbolt screen.  Using kbdcmd/kbd+ kbdF1/kbd will duplicate the screen brightness of screen 1 to screen 2.  Now you can dim the 2nd screen with kbdF1/kbd  Repeat the kbdcmd/kbd+ kbdF1/kbd and the 2nd screen will revert to last brightness. Now you can dim the iMac screen with the brightness keys.  <answer121330> I have MBP early 2011 connected to LED display and Thunderbolt display and I use the thunderbolt display as extended desktop.  This is how you can adjust the brightness on second display.  ol liPress kbdcmd/kbd+kbdF1/kbd. This will mirror the displays./li liPress kbdF1/kbd or kbdF2/kbd and both screens will increase or decrease in brightness./li liWhen you are done, press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdF1/kbd and your screens will revert back to extended desktop mode./li /ol  Ok, its a pain if you are like me and have items configured on both screens but I found using "shades" the second monitor was always looking dimmer and not the same brightness as the primary screen.  <answer123450> Open System Preferences; Click Displays; In the lower left hand menu, click the Show displays in menu bar; Once your menu bar has the little icon of your monitor, click it and select  Open Display Preferences;  All monitors will have a Preferences menu linked to that specific object.  <answer128441> Another option is Brightness Slider, free in App store.  <answer187315> If you are using a 24" thunderbolt display which has a USB cable in addition to the thunderbolt cable, strongyou have to have both plugged in/strong. Then Ctrl + F1 and Ctrl + F2 should work.  <answer216164> A dead-simple program called Brightness Control has been dimming multiple external monitors for me since 2006. Still working fine on OS X 10.11 in 2016.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L4y1J.png" width="279" height="143" alt="Brightness Control.app" title="Brightness Control doing one thing well"  Only drawback is that you cannot simultaneously run f.lux. If you only have one external monitor, you can use Shady to dim that without quitting f.lux.  <comment22447> Yeah, I'm talking about a standard VGA monitor. Thanks! <comment32738> I don't have a Thunderbolt Display. I have a standard VGA monitor, but I will try it. <comment55686> Thanks, but I don't have a Thunderbolt display. I have a standard VGA monitor. <comment55696> What is the brand and model of the external display, and what is the means of connection? (VGA, Thunderbolt, DVI, Mini DisplayPort). It is always helpful to give full specifications when you ask a question. <comment55705> @WheatWilliams Thanks! I edited my question <comment65435> Yes, but does it allow you to change the *secondary display's* brightness? <comment78906> USB cable did it! Thanks <comment79078> On my Mac Pro (with two DVI displays), 10.7.4, this does not work. <comment80102> This works for my MacBook Pro with dual Thunderbolt displays. <comment91080> I'm looking to solve the same problem but with a Mini DisplayPort monitor. For more on this topic check out: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61045/does-apple-support-ddc-ci-for-3rd-party-displays-via-apples-thunderbolt-to-dvi  Not surprised that Apple doesn't give a damn about standards. <comment95303> This doesn't work with displays other than Apple's I think. <comment109390> Please change the correct answer to the one with the most upvotes so that people are sure to see it. Thanks! <comment119705> Fixed (again). Sorry. <comment119744> Thanks for the fixed link.  It only works for my laptop display on my setup under 10.8, though. When I try to set the external it says "failed to set brightness of display 0x4246511 (error -536870201)" <comment125975> Worked perfectly with my studio display and imac setup.  Thanks! <comment130482> Didn't work for me... <comment132222> Cmd+F1 mirrors the whole display, not just the brightness. <comment135695> This is BRILLIANT! Works very well with dual thunderbolt display setup with MacBook in clamshell mode. Wish I can award 100 points for this! The only thing missing how is how to sync the brightness on the displays, but this is already a huge step forward. <comment154961> seems to set the same brightness to all screens <comment167248> @abbyhairboat Thinking about buying another display, what happens if two thunderbolt displays are attached? Does this change the brightness on both at the same time?  What if you want a different brightness on one vs the other? <comment167249> @y3sh Not sure as I only have two displays atm. I know that adding "shift" switches the brightness control from one monitor to the other; maybe that'll be the secret with 2 thunderbolt + 1 built-in. I can't imagine any key combo would change brightness on more than one display at a time. <comment199007> Wow, it works like a charm even for the macos with damaged discrete gfx card, when you can not change the brightness with the standard keys, <comment217837> Dead link to your precompiled version. <comment233252> https://github.com/superduper/BrightnessMenulet Very good (and tested on `Dell S2340L`) for non-apple monitors but AFAIK works only for main display (where the menu bar appears) <comment234861> Use my own fork of **Brightness Menulet**, it supports auto adjustment based on the `ambient light sensor` https://github.com/MuhammadHewedy/BrightnessMenulet <comment254200> I was able to compile brightness.c just fine, and it works on the built in monitor.  Like @JoshuaGoldberg, it errs out when the external display is connected. <comment254531> Note that this answer is 4 years old. There is a newer tool available at https://github.com/nriley/brightness or `brew install screenbrightness` <comment259564> This has worked for me for the last couple OSX versions (Mavericks, Yosemite). <comment290264> As of today it only controls the brightness of the main monitor.  I think Ina's issue was reported as a bug and maybe they "fixed" it.  To me, setting all the screens to the same brightness is the correct behavior. <comment300855> Macbook Pro ( 2015 ) with external 24" Cinema display only uses control F1 / F2 if the USB is connected.  Just having the thunderbolt connection is not enough to get the F1/F2 to work. <comment301007> I tried all of the above (brighness.c, brew install brightness), as I prefer command line based approaches, and the only one that worked with my external displays was "Shades", which doesnt support command line, but works ;-) <comment302168> Shady seems to only dim one display on OS X 10.11 (if you connect your monitor after Shady is already running, it will dim your main display which doesn't solve the problem). Restarting Shady after connecting an external monitor seems to force it to change the brightness on the secondary display. <comment302173> My habits have changed some. I now dim my built-in display with the keyboard controls (I’ve come to prefer turning down the backlight vs. a semi-transparent overlay), and for my external displays I use a different ancient program called [ScreenShade](http://screenshade.en.softonic.com/mac/download). Fair warning, the original host site has been taken over by malware people so don’t let it open their tutorial on the web. I like ScreenShade for monitor selection flexibility and the keyboard shortcuts (option-plus and option-minus). <comment302174> Thanks for the update. Just installed, works great! <comment302175> There seems to be a problem with CTRL+left/right arrow to switch between Spaces on the main display while using ScreenShade. <comment302177> @victor Hmm, bizarre. I haven’t had that problem. I’d say double check your keyboard shortcuts in OS X Settings  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Mission Control. Otherwise, no idea... the app is from 2008 so no surprise it’s a little janky. <comment302178> Toggled the "Move left a space" hotkey and restarted ScreenShade, works fine now. <comment349883> How does this answer improve on [the answer posted ½ year prior](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/28474/37797)? <comment354081> All this did for me was select the apple icon in the top left of the monitor. <comment360266> I agree with user1380540. The shortcut wasn't working to adjust the brightness. But, when I connected the USB cable of the thunderbolt display, and opened my system preferences -- Display, it gave me the option to adjust the brightness. I am on MBP Retina Mid 2014, Mac OS Sierra 10.12.5 with 24-inch LED Cinema Display.
