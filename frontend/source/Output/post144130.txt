How to verify if the MacBook Pro HDD cable is faulty? <body> Is it possible that I take out the HDD cable and test it with multimeter to see if all wires are connected, etc? Is there a pin diagram for it?  The problem:  I have this MacBook Pro mid 2009, lat year the hard disk was behaving fishy, so I bought a new HDD and installed it. Problem solved, till now. The same problem is back. Mac does not boot. Sometimes I can boot in the Bootcamp windows though. And when I put the  HDD in enclousure and connect to a PC with USB, it is just fine. Even it passed the SeaTools test. When I connect this HDD via USB to my mac, it can boot mac normally, but after some time it crashes.  Another test I made: I put the old HDD in the Mac, it booted fine, but after some time it crashed.  Now I am not sure if it is the HDD cable which is faulty or the HDD or something else.  Is there a way I can test HDD cable seperately and be sure it is faulty before spending 50 quids on a new one?  Thanks  <answer144137> You would use a OHM meter, to test the wires.   The cable and the plugs are 1:1 thus same pin on both sides.  The meter should show full connection, thus no resistance at all.  Some meters have the Audible signal for testing the connection.  I know you know this but here it is anyway.
