How can I backup Outlook for Mac 2016 on my mac? <body> I am in need to clean up my outlook for mac 2016 and looking forward to an organized mailbox. But before that, I need to backup all my email database from outlook mac so that I don't lose any emails. The Outlook for mac export is taking a lot of time to export the mailboxes as they are quite large in number. Is there any other way around to backup the outlook for mac 2016?  <answer278791> Let the export complete. The internal storage of mails in Outlook 2016 for Mac is a cached version for all imap / google accounts that changes internally from version to version.   The export yields a far more standard and stable data dump which serves the purpose of being importable at a later date.   If you have local folders - on my Mac then things are slightly more complicated. Perhaps that's part of the slower export?  <answer278906> ol liWhat exact Mac model do you have?/li liWhat exact Mac OS are you running?/li liFor Outlook, do you have Office 2008, Office 2011, or Office 2016? I have used all 3, but am most familiar with Email cleaning for Outlook 2011 and (currently) Outlook 2016./li liHave you ever done any disk cleanup/maintenance/repairs, from a software perspective?/li liAre you making backups to an external device? And if so, what software are you using for that?/li /ol  Now, regarding Outlook, I assume you have deleted Emails in the past. Also, you should consider deleting any you do not need. For Outlook 2011, there is a way to rebuild its database (ie, Identity "file") to permanently remove deleted Emails. (For Outlook 2016, the procedure is different).  Here's a link for outook for mac 2016 database rebuild: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1274738-office-2016-for-mac-manual-database-identity-rebuild  If that also does not work then you can opt for third party apps, one which is making headlines now a days is mail backup x, check out one of the articles:http://www.mailbackupx.com/how-to-scenerios/how-to-backup-outlook-mac-mails-on-mac.html  Please note that all the third party apps are paid. First go for the manual procedure.   I hope this helps.

If all you want is to have a backup in case something goes wrong while reorganising your mailbox, then it should already be backed up via Time Machine (unless you've specifically excluded it from your TM backups). <comment352615> mail backup x work just fine.thanks
