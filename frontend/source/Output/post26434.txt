View laptop hardware statistics <body> How can I return the temperatures, fan speeds, etc, using Terminal?  <answer26436> Here's a website with a script:  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20051021115356696     While hunting around in ioreg I found a bunch of hardware sensor readouts, including CPU and GPU temperatures. I had no idea this stuff was available without a compiled app, so I excitedly whipped up a bash script (tp v0.1) to display the values.    <answer26490> This website claims to have a free commandline tool to monitor temperature sensors.  http://www.bresink.de/osx/0TemperatureMonitor/details.html     tempmonitor command-line tool      Temperature Monitor      version for the BSD command-line of Mac OS X, temperature sensors only      yes   (Name of tool; part of package download; description; free of charge?)  <comment30217> Might have worked in 2005, but returns nothing on mid 2010 iMac with Lion. Looking at the script, `ioreg -n IOHWSensor` will not return expected values. <comment30219> @koiyu - I agree.  I'll delete this answer.  (It'd be useful if it got another two downvotes.) <comment30242> @Dan, there you go, 1 more down vote. <comment62013> Wow, that tool is awesome! Funnily the guy who coded it was my computer graphics teaching assistent a decade ago :)
