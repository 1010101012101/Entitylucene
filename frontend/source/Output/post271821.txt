Groups in contacts do not appear in iTunes synch <body> I have a very organised contact system on my Mac including groups for my husband's clients and suppliers.  I have just set up an iPhone 5 for him but cannot synch his group of contacts to the his phone.  The option does not appear in iTunes when I try to click on groups rather than synch all contacts.  I have turned iCloud off so now I don't know what to do.  <comment341709> Can you add some screenshots of the relevant parts in iTunes so we see the same thing you do?
