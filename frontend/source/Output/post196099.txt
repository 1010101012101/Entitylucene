discoveryutil: command not found <body> After connecting VPN I often have to flush DNS to get my private hosts to be found. I would do this  codesudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache; sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches/code  Now, after upgrading to Yosemite 10.10.4, I get   codesudo: discoveryutil: command not found/code  So, codediscoveryutil/code is gone in 10.10.4? How can I flush DNS now?  <answer196101> Since discoveryutil was replaced by its predecessor mDNSResponder in 10.10.4 use codesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder/code again (like in Lion/Mountain Lion/Mavericks) to flush the DNS cache.  <answer203262> A colleague has suggested codesudo dscacheutil -flushcache/code. The Apple documentation states     dscacheutil -- gather information, statistics and initiate queries   to the Directory Service cache.         -flushcache                 Flushes the entire cache.  This should only be used in extreme cases.  Validation information                 is used within the cache along with other techniques to ensure the OS has valid information                 available to it.
