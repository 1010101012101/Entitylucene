What should I do after my iphone 6 froze and turned into black screen with a small loading loading sign? <body> My iphone 6 froze and turned into black screen with a small loading loading sign. I charged it last night for the whole night and woke up and found out nothing happened.  <comment339981> Try holding the home button and the power button simultaneously for about 10 seconds. Connect it to a computer running iTunes if that should not work. <comment339986> My iPhone had a similar Black Screen of Death last week. I knew about Home/Power and tried that without success for 24-36 hours. Finally, I found another option: Power Button and the Volume Down button.   Apparently, the former is a Hard Reset and the latter is a Soft Reset? <comment340052> This is only true for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.
