Solution for docking iPad mini on a wall? <body> I'm looking for a solution for a wall-mounted dock for an iPad mini which is being used to control different elements of a home entertainment system for a client.  So far, I think what I like best is this agility case from Otterbox paired with one or more of their various docks and mounts. It looks a lot like I could mount their wall mount right next to a power outlet and just use keep a regular adapter plugged in all the time, or maybe figure out how to mount their power dock to a wall.  Ideally, there would be no cord for children to steal to charge their own iOS devices.  What're your thoughts? Has anyone found a great solution?  <comment196711> There are thousands of products that secure iPads in commercial (airport and coffee shop) use but they really are overkill. Tell the children that the cable for the kitchen iPad is marked with marker (and do so) and they shouldn't take it. Are you really looking to "lock" everything down?
