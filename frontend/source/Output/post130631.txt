My iPhone charger emits a little very high pitch noise when my iPhone is charged... is it normal? <body> When my iPhone 5s is fully charged my charger (which is the official one), emits a super little noise that is very high pitch (I would say nearly an ultrasound...). Is it normal ?  <answer130635> Have you ever wondered why the chargers are so small now days?  Depending on your age, would remember that in old days the chargers were big and very heavy.  It was the heaviest thing to carry around with your Laptop.  Now days there are comparatively small an d light weight.  Let me get to the point.  The new technology use high frequency transformers (15kHz range)  That would be the Ultrasound range.  If the circuit is not correct you would hear that sound.  Here is a sample how it sounds at 10kHz range.  Normally you should not hear the 15kHz, so in your chase the charger is creating lower (10kHz) harmonics, because it is not working properly.  Warning:  If you have a dog make sure it does not go crazy.  <comment153209> @Buscar웃 You mean when the charger is plugged to the sector but not to the phone ? <comment153210> No, it is not normal to hear anything from the charger <comment153211> Is it hot? so you can not touch it <comment153212> @Buscar웃 No, just as warm as any charger. So do you advise me to get it back to the seller ? <comment153213> Guessing here, but it is a bad charger, when phone reports fully charged, the charger suppose to limit the current to zero. A circuit is not doing a good job with that and creates a high pitch noise constantly switching. Get it replaced ! <comment153214> Ok thank you ! :) <comment153215> PLEASE DO. I was wondering what that was. It's driving me [crazy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus). :P <comment153217> @chillin ^^ Do you mean that you discovered that this high pitch sound you was hearing was in fact coming from your charger thanks to my post ? <comment153221> I would say something a little bit more like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyZhQj0k7-s but it is pretty hard to tell since the sound isn't loud at all. <comment153222> In fact it is more 10 kHz as @Buscar웃 said ! <comment153223> I am just 16 yo ! In fact it is exactly this sound but less louder ! Thank you for your detailed answer ! :) <comment153224> Yes I do have a dog but it seems like he is not near enough to be disturbed by this noise ! I will bring my charger back to my career. <comment153226> I am "only" 50 years more than you but my hearing is still ok. <comment153229> @Buscar I'd be willing to bet you can't hear a thing above 14KHz ;-) <comment153230> Non now,have some respect for the elderly..
