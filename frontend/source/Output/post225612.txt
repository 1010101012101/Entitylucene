Disable Screen Sleep AppleScript <body> Is there a way to turn screen sleeping on and off temporarily through AppleScript? I'm making a script at the moment that will run for a few minutes when I'm away, so I don't want it to sleep, but don't want to manually do it every time.  <answer225613> You can use the AppleScript strongdo shell script/strong command with the codepmset/code command to alter the energy saving settings.  The following example disables display sleep:  precodedo shell script "pmset -a displaysleep 0" with administrator privileges /code/pre  <answer225646> Certainly the easiest way to accomplish this is by using codedo shell script/code. codepmset/code is definitely a viable option, though I am personally partial to the codecaffeinate/code command, which doesn't modify any preferences and doesn't require administrator privileges. You could use the following AppleScript to keep your screen awake indefinitely:  precodedo shell script "caffeinate -di" /code/pre  Alternatively, you can run caffeinate for a specified amount of time, after which your display will be free to go to sleep:  precodedo shell script "caffeinate -dit [time in seconds]" /code/pre  <comment274002> Worked perfectly, thanks!
