Kernel_task using 300% CPU time, high fan speed and slow computer in MacBook Pro <body> My MacBook Pro has become slow lately. Activity monitor shows kernel task is using around 300% CPU. The fan is always on at high speed.  Below are the details of my computer:  ul liMacbook Pro 13-inch, Mid 2012;/li liProcessor  2.5 GHz Intel Core i5;/li liMemory  4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3;/li liGraphics  Intel HD Graphics 4000 /li /ul  Please suggest some solutions.  I tried resetting the SMC a few times.  h2Console Log/h2  precodeJun  5 17:17:11 Manishs-MacBook-Pro kernel[0]: Resetting IOCatalogue.

Just type kernel (as you did) in the filter window in the Console then select some 50 lines use Copy, and Paste it in here. One more question, do you use disk encryption? <comment157565> @Buscar웃 I don't have disk encryption. Done as you said about lines from console. <comment172455> There are too many plausible explanations. It could, for example, be a [runaway process](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS147) throttling the kernel. **1)** Please run [Etrecheck](http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck) and either update your post with the output, or post the contents to [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) and update with the pastebin link. **2)** have you used any third party utility, such as Onyx to "clean the system"? **3)** Run the following command in Terminal and update your post with it's output: `(pmset -g; echo; pmset -g assertions) | open -a TextEdit` <comment174957> Seems to work on 10.10 Yosemite Beta, too. <comment219741> What if there is no file corresponding to my Model Identifier (MacBookPro10,1)? <comment226483> @Gujamin, for that case, ``sudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/ ~`` worked for me. <comment231176> I also had to do what Vivek posted just above (I went to the directory in Finder, moved it to desktop, and was asked for my password, that also worked) *I would love to know what causes this.* <comment232818> Neither Christian nor Vivek's suggestion had any effect for me on Yosemite 10.10.3... <comment232819> This appears to have solved it for me on Yosemite 10.10.3 on rMBP late 2012 <comment265807> Vivek's suggestion worked for me on Yosemite 10.10.3. I moved it to a sub folder of ~, but that shouldn't matter. I thought it didn't work at first because it took 60 seconds after rebooting to get noticeably quiet. It had to finish cooling down.
