Google Photos Backup: How to upload edited versions edited in Apple Photos? <body> strongGoogle Photos Backup/strong (aka strongDesktop uploader/strong) only uploads the original photos in my Apple Photos Library. I want it to upload the edited versions, if they exist, and if possible replace the original one. Is there any way to accomplish this? Even if it requires a bit of hacking, I'm interested.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bhJFb.png" alt="screenshot of google photos backup settings"
