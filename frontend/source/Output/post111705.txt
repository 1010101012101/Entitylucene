Iphone 4s screen lock <body> I can't figure out why my iphone4s isn't working. The screen isn't picking up on my touch, I can't swipe to unlock. I can't turn the phone off as I have to unlock it first which obviously I can't. My guess is to leave it wait for the battery to drain out to force shutdown.   My alarm is going off and will continue to snooze every 10 minutes until I swipe the phone to turn the alarm off, which as stated I CAN'T!!!! Any tips?  <answer111708> You can force the phone to restart by holding the lock and home buttons simultaneously for several seconds.  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1430
