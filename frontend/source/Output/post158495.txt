Ubuntu HUD in Mac OS <body> Is there and app or something that gives Yosemite the functionality that Ubuntu HUD has - search menu for items?  I am switching to Mac from Ubuntu. Even thou I was on Ubuntu Linux for only a few weeks and originally came from a Windows background, I got super used to the HUD  functionality. I would like to take that with me if possible.  <answer158499> strongSpotlight/strong on OS X is the closest built-in feature, Use Spotlight in OS X Mavericks to find files and more.  There are third party alternatives that have additional functionality. Well known examples include:  ul liAlfred/li liLaunchBar/li liQuicksilver/li /ul  <answer158594> If you're looking to search the menu of the active program, the Help menu generally includes a search feature that does exactly this.  If you wish to bind it to a key for quick access, that can be done in the Keyboard preference pane, under the Shortcuts tab. Select "App Shortcuts" from the box on the left, and create a shortcut for "Show Help menu".  <comment186341> Thanks for answering. They all seem to be searching the wider scope than the current programs menu. I think the spotlight will suffice for my needs for that. But i need something also for the smaller scope :) <comment187937> Can't up vote! Thanks for answer. <comment305712> The standard shortcut for the help menu is `Cmd + Shift + /` (`7` on an German keyboard) @MihkelL.
