How to restrict "Remote Login" (ssh) access to only certain IP ranges? <body> Can someone please tell me how to restrict SSH access only to certain IP ranges (e.g. local network) and not the whole Internet? I guess this has to be done via firewall.  <answer34098> If you are behind a router and didn't map the port to your computer, that effectively disables SSH access from the internet.  <answer40774> I did not test this, but I'd try this in terminal:  precodesudo ipfw add allow src-ip 10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/16,192.168.0.0/16 dst-ip me dst-port 22 sudo ipfw add reject src-ip any dst-ip me dst-port 22 /code/pre  <answer40779> From codeman sshd/code:  precode/etc/hosts.allow /etc/hosts.deny Access controls that should be enforced by tcp-wrappers are defined here.   Further details are described in hosts_access(5). /code/pre  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/87 offers these examples:  precode# /etc/hosts.allow sshd: 1.2.3.0/255.255.255.0 sshd: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0  # /etc/hosts.deny sshd: ALL /code/pre  The TCP wrapper program in Mac OS X is: codetcpd/code  <comment38894> Yes, I am aware of that. Unfortunately this isn't really a solution for me as this is for my MacBook Pro which occasionally is connected to networks with external IP and no router in-between. <comment38895> That seems very unlikely, and assuming you only have one network adapter, that would imply there is no 'local' network if a public IP address is bound to it. <comment38896> Unlikely or not, doesn't really matter, does it? Apart from external IP situation, consider Public WiFi networks. I know which networks are safe for me and I'd like to restrict access to only these networks. My question is a little more generic though which was my intention. <comment38924> I'd suggest rephrasing the question then. Sounds like you are looking to whitelist (some) IP ranges for some services in the firewall. <comment38927> Done as suggested. Cheers.
