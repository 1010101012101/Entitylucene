What is the best key remapper tool? <body> I use international keyboards which have kbd`/kbd (kbd~/kbd with shift) next to kbdZ/kbd key. I'm used to having kbd`/~/kbd key next to kbd1/kbd (currently, this key produces kbd§/kbd or kbd±/kbd with shift, which I don't use at all). My goal is to remap kbd§/±/kbd key to kbd`/~/kbd.  I have found several key remapping tools for Mac OS, so I want to ask which one do you have best experience with. (I use Mac OS X 10.6)  <answer2439> Ukelele  <answer2440> great question... I've been looking for a tool that will allow me to emulate TouchCursor for Windows on the mac for a long time.  Tried strongUkelele/strong, strongDoubleCommand/strong, and some others that I can't remember right now :)  KeyRemap4Macbook seemed to be closest to what I needed, but I could never get around to configuring it how I wanted it.  Your mileage may vary.  Check out this page that gives some of the aforementioned programs and start playing :)  <comment2309> Neither Ukelele nor KeyRemap4Macbook seem able to do this, but they are both great programs for the other tasks involved in having weird keyboards. <comment2354> Thanks. I use KeyRemap4Macbook for mapping paragraph sign to `/~ and so far it works great for me. No crashes :-) <comment2359> @Peter: glad it worked for you!  I need to spend some more time with it because I need to extend it in order to have it do what I want :) <comment35545> Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. <comment225322> http://xahlee.info/kbd/Mac_OS_X_keymapping_keybinding_tools.html
