10 bit/color channel support <body> I am in need of 10 bit colour/channel (30 bit in total). Everything in my workflow supports 10 bit colour/channel: DSLR, Eizo 276, D700 in my Mac Pro (late 2013). Unfortunately OSX 10.9.8 is still on 8 Bit/channel.  Can any body tell me a work around?  <answer134541> As far as I know OS X does not support 10 bits channels.   Here is a blog article which talks about it : strongNope/strong. br / Another site says they thought Mavericks would bring 10bits channels, but strongnope/strong. br / 4 month later, same site, still strongnope/strong.   <comment159208> You might want to update your question since OS X 10.9.8 does not exist. <comment159223> One line answers are discouraged. <comment159230> See my updates.
