How to disable Clamshell mode in Yosemite? <body> I have my Late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro attached to an external display. I use both displays. At night, when I leave my computer, I want to close the lid to put the Mac to sleep.  Since Lion, there is the famous 'Clamshell mode', which is for a lot of people, but not for me. This causes OS X to switch to single-display mode, using only the external display, if I close it.  Until Mavericks I could prevent this by the famous: codesudo nvram boot-args="iog=0x0"/code kernel parameter, but since Yosemite, this does not work. Is there any solution? I don't want to plug off my computer for the night or put it to sleep by selecting a menu command. Both solutions are really lame.  <answer152783> Not sure it's an exact answer to your question, but how about a Hot Corner to put it to Sleep?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C4dp8.png" alt="Sleep Hot Corner image"  ... or add a key command...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b6aww.png" alt="Key Command"  <answer153743> From what I can tell, if the macbook is plugged in and the external display is attached, it should not go to sleep and work similarly to the Mavericks method. I still have the nvram setting applied and so far so good; the only difference is that I have to keep the lid closed and use USB for keyboard and mouse.  Not perfect but close!  <answer154616> Download INSOMNIAX for Yosemite is free http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/22211/insomniax img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UK1Yk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer162142> Unplug or detach the power adapter before you close the lid. "Closed clamshell mode" requires the MacBook to be plugged into an outlet to activate.

I have set a strongHot Corner/strong on my mac to "Put Display to Sleep". Now before I close the lid, I drag the pointer to the chosen corner with a rather nonchalant swipe across the touchpad.   An extra step but works quite well for me. Hope that helps.  <comment179879> Thanks, but this is not easier than pressing the power button shortly. I really want to close only the lid to initiate sleep. :/ <comment179881> No worries - my Mac Pro doesn't have a lid, so for me, swiping to the bottom left corner with the mouse is by far the fastest. <comment179882> What is preventing it to Sleep when you close the lid ? <comment179883> If your laptop is connected to a power source and has an external display attached, it will not sleep, but use Clamshell mode instead, as far as I know. <comment179887> what does your "pmset -g" shows as settings? <comment179889> Here it is: https://gist.github.com/gklka/19541500bd8ca1f91bd7 <comment180958> You did not understand me. I want it to sleep even when external display is attached. <comment180959> Ah my bad, I thought you wanted the opposite! <comment189437> The preferences shown in your screenshot are not preventing my Yosemite MBP from sleeping upon lid-shut when connected to an external monitor. Nor does any combination of prefs prevent clamshell mode, unfortunately. <comment189442> Not only can I no longer simply shut the lid to sleep the Mac…if I now press the power button to sleep the Mac, but then shut the Mac's lid, it reawakens the system again in clamshell! <comment222835> what? ... i mean... WHAT? <comment265893> this app work perfectly for me thanks..!! <comment356127> _Step 1 of course is just the `power` button for older macbooks._ Any idea what it is for newer Macbooks, namely the late 2016 model?  I have no power button, just a fingerprint button next to `+` and it doesn't put the computer to sleep.
