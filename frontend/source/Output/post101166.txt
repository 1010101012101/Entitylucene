Best CAD system for Mac <body> I need a 3D CAD system for Mac, but as I am student now, I haven't got the opportunity to buy AutoCAD. So, can you recommend some good 3D CAD software on Mac? I found one - Autodesk Inventor, but when I saw that it is "Free" I don't believe it, as it is Autodesk, or it is really free?  <answer101726> AutoCAD for Mac is free for students, along with several other Autodesk apps.

We have a guide at [help] that will assist you in getting the best help here by showing your research and perhaps listing why you feel you need the software. Focusing on describing your details of the task you are seeking to solve with this software package will help us help you. <comment119400> This is not an answer as bmike is correct that you need to first define your needs - data compatibility - training sessions online, input devices and output formats. That being said, the three that I've tried are TurboCad, ArchiCad, and Cadintosh. The last one is made by the same (great) people who make Graphic Converter, and is only about $25. <comment119842> How will you use it?  Architectural packages are different than part modeling, for instance.
