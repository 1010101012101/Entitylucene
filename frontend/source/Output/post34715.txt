How do I play DVDs fullscreen on an external monitor in Lion? <body> MacbookPro6,2 running Mac OS Lion 10.7.2 attempting to run a DVD fullscreen on an external monitor.  My laptop display is primary, but I would like the DVD to run fullscreen on the External (a lovely 23"-er).  I'm fine with using VLC if that's necessary, but I prefer to not make the external monitor my primary display. #ihateyoumissioncontrol  <answer34733> You need to run VLC.  In VLC, go to the Video menu and the Fullscreen Video Device menu and choose which screen you want to use for fullscreen video playback.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFfK4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer38169> Another option is to mirror the display to the second monitor. I did this in a pinch the other day when I stumbled upon this wonderful, emahem/em, feature of Apple's DVD Player  <comment39699> Incidentally, VLC will fullscreen on whatever display that it is running. <comment39980> I thought that I had.
