Find/Replace Unicode codes in InDesign <body> I am typographer and 10 years ago I've made an emOld Church Slavonic/em font which has a lot of characters in Private Use Area of Unicode. Today more than 50 characters got codes inside of Unicode. I change the codes in new font but I have to change codes in lot of texts. For example:   ul lifind E1E6 and replace with 0417;/li lifind E308 and replace with 0437;/li /ul  ...and so on. All text is in InDesign. Is there some simple script to do that?
