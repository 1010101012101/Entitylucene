How can I troubleshoot USB drivers on El Capitan <body> I'm a developer and use Motorola Device Manager, and Android File Transfer to work with my Moto X devices.  Prior to the upgrade to El Capitan, I was able to use the USB port, run "adb" and all other developer level commands.   Now, ever since I did a clean install of El Capitan, (not an update), MDM and the system no longer sees my device.  I suspect this has to do with installing the driver After the OS install vs before.  Why? this forum post seems to indicate that at least one user is able to use the USB port in El Capitan.  Some troubleshooting I've done:   ul liVerified USB functionality by plugging in an iPad (works)/li liDisabled System Integrity Protection (SIP) just in case it breaks the driver/li liUninstalled and reinstalled MDM/li liEnabled / disabled developer mode on the phones/li liUpdated to the latest developer build (besides general release) of El Capitan/li liPlugged in the device and ensured that power was flowing. /li liLooked at USB power stats in the screen below (unplugging and plugging in)... no change in OS reported power consumption on MacBook Pro 2013 /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GOdo1.png" alt="enter image description here"  More troubleshooting steps:  ul liPlugged device into PC. Works.  (Android 4.4)/li liUsed a second phone (Different Moto X, Android 5.1), same issues as above./li /ul  What else can I try to get OSX to "see" the Android devices?    Soon I will boot into Bootcamp and see if that makes a difference....  <comment269298> Hit this deadend today. I am trying to setup android studio and motorola x play on mac El Capitan.
