iPod Touch 4G Screen Protector recommendation <body> I am looking for a screen protector for a new iPod Touch 4G. Reviews at Amazon are very mixed, so I am looking for recommendation from an experienced users.  Other then Zagg's InvisibleShield, which is pretty expensive, what other good protectors (i.e. - high clarity, good scratch resistance, quality cuts) are out there?  <answer15653> I'm going to strongly suggest that you consider NOT applying a screen protector.  The screen is hardened glass, and considerably harder than any piece of plastic you can apply to it, and the image quality will be better without a protector applied.  I've been using my iPhone 4 for almost a year now without a protector, and there is not a single scratch on the screen.  Granted I'm careful about which pocket I put it in, but you shouldn't need a protector.  Note that Apple has ceased to sell protectors other than ones specifically for reducing glare.  <comment17006> Please read the [FAQ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq).

Also, it is not me, but my wife who's gonna use it, and knowing her - it will be "stored" in a crammed handbag - which is my concern. Heck, she was able to render a used iPod that I got her last year dead in two months of use... that is a device that worked nicely for a couple of years before she received it... <comment17048> Apparently the iPod Touch does NOT have gorilla glass, so it's not quite as touch as the iPhone. Perhaps a sleeve cover to put it in when it's in that handbag?
