How to remove iPhone music from Amazon Music app? <body> There's an setting in Amazon Music app "Add playlists from device" which lets you select from playlists in your iTunes library. I enabled this once and music from my iPhone added to the Amazon Music. However now I turned it off but the device music still in the Amazon Music app, how can I remove these songs without going to each one individually and remove it?  <answer262754> Unfortunately after contacting Amazon, it looks like the only way is to remove the Amazon music app and reinstall it again and download the songs that were downloaded before!
