Logging in with Touch ID or a password <body> Just configuring a new MBP here and was wondering if there is anyway to set it up so on the lock screen you can log in with Touch ID OR the password.  I can't enroll the fingers of everyone in my family.  Thanks.  <comment373405> Is the Mac for general use with a single password, or does each family member have their own login? (Preferred as the admin can have finer control such as parental permissions etc) <comment373448> General use, one login <comment373449> I would highly advise you to set up separate users with one admin as recommended by Apple.  [macOS Sierra: Set up users, guests, and groups on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US).  Especially if everyone has different email accounts, social media, documents, etc. <comment373639> It's just me and my kids, I figured out you can just click the user icon to bypass Touch ID login and login with a password, thanks
