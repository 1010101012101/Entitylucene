Using kdiff3 as default git diff viewer on Mac OS <body> I have kdiff3 installed on my Mac (Version 0.9.97, 64 bit). Here's my ~/.gitconfig:  precode[filter "media"]     required = true     clean = git media clean %f     smudge = git media smudge %f [user]     name = My Name     email = me@example.com  [core]     editor = atom --wait [merge]     tool = kdiff3 [mergetool "kdiff3"]     path = /Applications/kdiff3.app/Contents/MacOS/kdiff3 [diff]     tool = kdiff3 [difftool "kdiff3"]     path = /Applications/kdiff3.app/Contents/MacOS/kdiff3 /code/pre  Everything seems to be fine, except for the fact that when I do codegit diff/code, I see the output of the console diff. Any ideas on how to solve this?  <answer176577> Don't use  codegit diff myfile.txt/code  but  codegit difftool myfile.txt/code.  <comment198903> Is it possible to update your Git and use `git difftool` ([docs](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool)) instead?
