Transfer OSX Dashboard Widgets Between Computers <body> Can anyone tell me an easy way to transfer my dashboard widgets from one osx computer to another?  If there was a way to keep their positioning/settings too that would be great.  <answer8081> Widgets are saved at code/Library/Widgets//code and code/Users/[user]/Library/Widgets//code  If you copy code/Users/[user]/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dashboard.plist/code that will copy your Dashboard configuration.  Each widget will have it's own configuration file in code/Users/[user]/Library/Preferences//code, for example codewidget-com.apple.widget.weather.plist/code  <comment8707> thanks for the work!  I'll try copying those files/folders and see what happens <comment8782> still working on it.  copying didn't work automatically but I haven't restarted yet.  don't worry, I didn't forget :) <comment8791> @wajiw you can restart the Dock/Dashboard by `killall -HUP Dock` at a terminal <comment8792> nice, that works.  I had to re-add the widgets but they were there and had the same prefs.  thanks
