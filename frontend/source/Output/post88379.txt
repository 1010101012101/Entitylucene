OS X application manager <body> Unix-sytled, "package managers" like Fink, Homebrew, and MacPorts do a good job of managing 'headless' libraries.  I would like something similar to manage OS X applications with a GUI.    I am hoping to find an easier way to add/remove applications and restore my system in the event of loss or theft or if I purchase a new computer.  Requirements:  ul lifind and install applications/li likeep track of which applications I've installed/li liuninstall applications and preferences/li limanage licenses/li /ul  Candidates:  ul liAppFresh for Mac - best candidate; not free/li lihomebrew-cask - good candidate; limited application support/li liApple's App Store - easily find and install applications; doesn't remove applications; not all applications are in the App Store/li liAppCleaner - removes applications and preferences, but does not install applications/li liosx.iusethis.com - tracks application (which will replace my spreadsheet); does not manage applications/li /ul  Are there others?  <answer112429> Bodega can install, check for updates, and uninstall. It also has ability to search for new applications based on your search terms and/or category. It's pretty good, but it is not all-inclusive.  Macupdate Desktop is shareware that is similar to Bodega, but has no feature to uninstall applications as far as I know.  <comment103428> There is [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask), but it only includes about 150 applications at the moment.
