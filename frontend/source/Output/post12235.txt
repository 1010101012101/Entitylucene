Memory upgrade for MBP <body> I'm looking to upgrade my 15'' 2011 MBP from 4 GB to 8 GB. The memory upgrade on the Apple Store is 200$, apparently it can be done for ~100 $ quite easily.  I've seen this 2x8GB kit from Crucial: Crucial 2x4GB memory kit.  Do you think it's a good choice ? Any better ideas ?  <answer12237> The Crucial kit is one of the better ones out there.  I've used their modules in the past.  However, on my new MPB, I decided to get the 8Gb from Apple.  I'd go with the Crucial if you want good quality and great value.  Here is a video showing installation http://www.ramfor.com/ram-memory/apple-macbook-pro-early-2011-crucial-memory-upgrade/  <comment13130> Thanks, I did the upgrade, seems to work just fine !
