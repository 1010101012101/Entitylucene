Brand new MacBook Pro with Retina display - Mail, Preview and App Store freezes on launch <body> I can never use most Apple-made apps on my MacBook Pro with Retina display, as the UI never responds, however Mail gets new emails and Preview displays images. It's just that I cannot click.  I can't close it and I can't use the menu bar, however it responds to keyboard commands.  I have to force quit these apps every single time. I don't have the 'reopen windows' option on, so I don't understand what is going on. Activity Monitor is normal.  <answer144913> Found out what it was.  strongInk  Write Anywhere/strong was enabled, when it shouldn't. As soon as it was disabled, the affected Apple apps started working again.  I thought it was something to do with the Wacom tablet I bought, but couldn't find any connection. Now I know it was Apple's own Ink software. Maybe I shall report it as a bug.  <comment170014> Just cleared font cache in Onyx. No result. <comment170538> You do not want to mess around with that--bring it to service. But if you must, publish Console log (located in your Utility folder) using (copy/paste) some 30 lines from the time stamp of relevance. <comment170704> Why not? I've been using OnyX ever since Panther. <comment170707> Plus, on a well known forum, I saw somebody fix the problem by doing so. <comment271406> I'm having the same thing, i didn't install ink it appeared on it own
