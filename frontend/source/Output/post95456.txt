iBookstore and Kindle <body> I bought a book in the iBookstore to read on my iPad, but the iPad isn't that easy on my eyes. I recently bought a Kindle because my grandson said the e-ink would be better for reading. Is there a way to convert the iBook to a format I can read on my Kindle?  <answer95460> You will have to change the file format.  This might be helpful to you http://calibre-ebook.com/.  Also this is a good resource: http://www.epubor.com/read-ibooks-on-kindle.html.  Good Luck
