Get Apple ID security questions over email <body> I have forgotten the answers to my security questions, but I don't want to/have time to call apple support and have them tell me my questions. Is there any way to maybe reset/get them over email?  <answer114473> No - Apple won't email you security questions.   You can self-serve at https://iforgot.apple.com or interact with Apple support. Emailing those questions would be a large security breach given that email encryption is not commonplace or supported for Apple's consumer support division.  <answer114943> My suggestion is that you telephone Apple consumer support. They are pretty good. Be nice and have lots of information about your prior purchases.
