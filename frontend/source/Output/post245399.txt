How to sync an iBooks collection created on my iPad? <body> I recently created a few collections in iBooks on my iPad.  When I synced my iPad with my Mac, none of the collections that I created in iBooks on my iPad are visible on in iBooks on my Mac.  How do I get these collections to be visible and fully synced across all of my devices?  Everything is fully up-to-date: the iPad is running iOS 9.3.2, the Mac is on OS X 10.11.5.    <answer245443> You may find your answer here: (Use iCloud Drive or iBooks to access your PDF files, ePub files, and books) https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT205751 or here: (Sync iBooks between your Mac and your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch) https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202759  <comment303146> The first link is not relevant to collections. The second one is simply about the settings, all of which are match those on my iPad and Mac. The collections that I have created on my iPad are not appearing in iBooks on my Mac at all.
