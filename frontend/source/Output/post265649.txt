Where does macOS save apple id associated with an app? <body> How can I find the apple id associated with an application that purchased from Mac App Store?   Earlier we could have find this information from code.plist/code file that placed inside the app bundle. Now I am not able to find this piece of information there. Does macOS save strongapple id - application/strong pair some where in any other form?  I am using macOS Sierra v10.12.2 (16C67).  <comment333147> MacOS assigns decryption keys to the apps you have purchased. It doesn't write the Apple ID in plaintext. <comment333154> @bret7600 where can I find the key? Will it be different for each apps?
