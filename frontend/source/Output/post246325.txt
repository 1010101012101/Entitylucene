Slow progress of Time machine backup <body> I am backing up my hdd with the Time machine. Even small incremental backups take several hours. For an hour or so I am in the state "50.3 MB of 496.3MB", while in Activity Monitor I notice that mds_stores has accumulated already over 116 GB data read, and it increases by about 50 MB/s.   My Hdd is this new pcie-sdd type, so it should be efficient with this sort of backup. Moreover in Console it is written that about 2300 files constitute this 0.5 GB of backup.   I am backing up to external usb Toshiba drive.  Am I missing something obvious? This is not normal, is it? Can I see which of these 2300 files the Time machine is currently backing up? The "preparing" phase was not so long - took about 30 minutes.  <answer260975> I was having the same problem pretty regularly. I tried the usual tricks (stop backup, eject, mount, delete code.inProgress/code files, stopping spotlight, changing the throttle priority (codesudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0/code). Sometimes, this works. Other times it doesn't and it keeps crawling along at a few MB per hour.  One additional trick, that works more frequently, is to force quit the codebackupd/code process directly from the Disk tab of codeActivity Monitor/code. Then tell it to start backup. This usually works for me. Heads up: this may be a terrible idea in other ways (e.g. maybe it could damage existing backups). In my experience, it hasn't so far.  <comment304704> Mine was a very similar question, with no solution, yet. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/244117/time-machine-backup-time <comment304723> Indeed. I am consufed as number of files to copy is low, and these are small files. I do not see any regularities- sometimes backups are slow, sometimes they are quick, and this is not just a function of data size.  I have restarted Spotlight, but ultimately leaving the computer for whole day and night was the only solution. <comment304741> My OS drive (I have a MacPro with multiple drives) only has 50GB used. I just left for a few hours, after turning off Dropbox and PogoPlug. The current backup shows 1.17GB. No idea why this much data think it changed.
