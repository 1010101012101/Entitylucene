How to  use the built–in VPN Server on Mac OS 10.6.6 <body> I know that Mac OS 10.6.6 has a built in VPN server that one can access through command line. Is there an easier way? Can I make an Automator or AppleScript program that starts and stops the built–in VPN server? I have Developer tools installed.  I see that there are several paid software front–ends, like "iVPN", yet I would rather learn how to do this by myself.   The codeman/code pages are a bit thick for me. But if I could find a step by step walk through then maybe I could parse the codeman/code pages.  <answer6319> Looks like this is what you're after, though I haven't tried it myself.  http://blog.theilluminatedengineer.com/?p=136  <comment6621> Thanks this is a bit more complex than I thought, yet I am going to give it a shot. I will try to do this for a few days then before I hit something I will go buy "iVPN"... <comment6622> There is an old version of iVPN, from back when it was open source, available here. http://tinyapps.org/docs/os_x_vpn_server.html
