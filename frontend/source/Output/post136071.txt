How to stop assignment of numbers to hostnames? <body> My devices, including airport stations, keep being assigned a number following their name (i.e. "ATV (3)"). I was hoping Mavericks would fix it but it did not.  Is this fixable, please?  <answer136081> This seems like a problem with your router. Try forcing your hostname with codescutil/code:  precodescutil --set HostName yourhostname /code/pre  h2Why the number?/h2  The bracketed numbers appear because the same Bonjour/ZeroConf name is being used multiple times on the network. If Bonjour detects a duplicate name, a number is appended to ensure uniqueness.  This does not indicate a serious problem. Resetting network caches and devices should help clear out the now superseded name.  Apple's Bonjour Frequently Asked Questions page discusses this behaviour:     h312. What should happen when two devices on the network both use the same service name?/h3      In the rare case where a name collision occurs, your device should add   a digit to the end of the name, for example:      code"Apple Mac mini (2)"/code
