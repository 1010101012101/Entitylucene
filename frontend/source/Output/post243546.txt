MBP Retina 15 inch, late 2013 shuts down randomly <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with: 2 GHz Intel Core i7, Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB. I use it mainly with my Henge Docks vertical docking station and Dell 25-inch UHD monitor with external Apple keyboard. In this setup it works perfectly well. However…  Yesterday, when I have taken my MBP out of the docking station and tried to work just on the notebook without any additional devices attached, it shut down after about 30 mins. No warning message, nothing. Nothing in the system log either - only the BOOT_TIME information after the restart.  In the evening (working from home - no peripherals - just the power adapter) I have experienced another shutdown and then decided to install latest El Capitan patch. After that I have run the built-in diagnostics - no errors found.  I tried to work but there were two more shut downs. After that I did reset the SMC and PRAM, but it did not solve my problem.  Today at work - working with a docking station - computer was stable as rock. No restart - nothing. But when I came home it shut down after about 40-50 mins and then about every 20-30 mins. I have no clue how it can work perfectly well with the lid closed but shuts down without any peripherals attached but with the lid open.  Any clues/hints? I am stuck and desperate (warranty ended long time ago).  Additional info:  ul liUsing WiFi both at work and at home Using Magic Mouse both at work and home Using only external display at work (lid closed in vertical docking station) /li liRestarts only outside of docking station (no matter if battery only or power adapter attached) /li liNewest El Capitan /li liNo sign of any error in the system log, Crash Reporter, Diagnostics etc. /li liNo core dumps (yes, I have increased the soft limit for core dumps)/li liCoconut Battery says it has 91% of original capacity and that is healthy /li liIt shuts down even with effectively idle CPU (just chrome, mail - thats it) so I don’t think it is overheating - the fan is not even turned on /li liNo message after I power it on again Shutdown looks as follows: screen goes dark (though it still has the backlight), keyboard illumination is on - it stays like that for 5-10 secs and then shuts down. It does not boot up again by itself - need to do it manually./li /ul  <answer243554> Sounds like some sort of hardware failure to me, and since that model is so un-repairable your only option is probably to prepare for an expensive Apple Store bill. An (admittedly bad) workaround would be to keep the machine docked and use VNC + an iPad or something to use the machine on-the-go.  <answer294020> Thermal paste MUST be replaced... I had same problem and solved as I exchanged the thermal paste for a quality one...   <comment299969> Please issue the command `syslog | grep shutdown` in Terminal and post the results.  You should have a shutdown code even if you lose power. <comment299985> @Allan you're right. After each such shutdown I have the following entry: "Previous shutdown cause: -128" <comment299987> and according to CarbonHeaders sources it means: "userCanceledErr"... wtf? <comment299988> That's a system error code; what we are looking for is a *shutdown code* and -128  is an unknown error.  The last time I assisted someone with this, it turned out to be memory.  Unfortunately, your RAM cannot be removed.  Start with Apple Diagnostics - hold D while booting from powered off state with AC adapter plugged in.  You may have to do this several times since this is intermittent. <comment299990> Given that it only restarts outside the dock, it may be an issue with the graphics chip.  Diagnostics may tell you that, but a trip to the service center may be warranted here. <comment299994> I have run the diagnostics a few times and I only get info about battery (PPT004). As for the GPU - it has the one integrated with the CPU. Also - it is still used even in the dock... <comment299997> That could be it..given that you are on AC while in the dock and probably on battery while off.  It's best to take it in as they have more robust diagnostics. <comment300007> Thanks @Allan. Your comments were most useful. <comment300013> Glad I could help.  When you get your final result from the repair shop...add it as an answer so we can close the loop.  :-) <comment300080> It has been sent to apple service, will know more in 2 or 3 weeks. <comment304678> Just an update: my MBP is still in service... I guess they totally forgot about it :/ <comment312285> It was the mainboard :( <comment355912> I'm having the same problem.... Late 2013 model, battery less than a year old. Seems like it only happens on battery power for me.
