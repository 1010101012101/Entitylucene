running a simple shell script on startup in Yosemite <body> Regarding stackexchange  post how to get shell scripts to run at startup on Yosemite  The offering here is interesting but all I want to do is set the ip address of one of the ethernet interfaces, en0 with ifconfig. I don't want to launch a deamon.  the command to run is just:  precodeifconfig en0  inet 192.168.1.23 netmask 255.255.255.0  /code/pre  Of course the interface drivers have to be launched and the interfaces available for configuration.  This has to be run by root, other wise it has to be prefaced with sudo, which has to have the credentials provided.  I have the root account activated on this system and am comfortable with and know most of the hazards.  But I don't want to do this manually every time the machine is booted or restarted.  Perhaps someone from Apple has a reference to a patch or info on why the network preference operations for manual configuration of interfaces will not set them on mine.   I have been buying and using Macs since the late 1990's. This is one of only two out of nearly a dozen Macs I have owned that is not newly purchased from a reputable dealer.  Apache server will also not launch with the web sharing option.  Perhaps the machine with the installation is too old? It is  precodeNote: I BOUGHT THIS MACHINE USED FOR CASH  Model Name:    MacBook Pro  Model Identifier:  MacBookPro5,1  Processor Name:    Intel Core 2 Duo  Processor Speed:   2.4 GHz  Number of Processors:  1  Total Number of Cores: 2  L2 Cache:  3 MB  Memory:    4 GB  Bus Speed: 1.07 GHz  Boot ROM Version:  MBP51.007E.B06  SMC Version (system):  1.33f8  &lt;sn deleted for this post&gt;   Hardware UUID:    63410FEB-9CFF-5C8C-A692-8733BBEE36C5  Sudden Motion Sensor:  State: Enabled /code/pre  This does not tell me its actuall manufacture date.  Thank you for time and attention  Jeff  <answer156511> You could save your script whatever you want and call it from a code.plist/code file saved on code/Library/LaunchAgents//code to be launched at startup.  Let me explain how to do it with an example.  ul liCreate you script and save it on code/Users/username/setip.sh/code./li liCreate a new file called codecom.username.setip.plist/code in code/Library/LaunchAgents//code. This file must have the following format:/li /ul  pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"code&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;com.username.setip&lt;/string&gt;    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Users/username/setip.sh&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;    &lt;key&gt;Nice&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt;    &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;integer&gt;60&lt;/integer&gt;    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt;    &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;/tmp/com.username.setip.err&lt;/string&gt;    &lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;/tmp/com.username.setip.out&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  The file is pretty self-explanatory. It will launch the command code/Users/username/setip.sh/code every 60 seconds, will be launched at load, will save errors on code/tmp/com.username.setip.err/code and logs on code/tmp/com.username.setip.out/code.  Restart, and the script will be executed.  <comment183960> Is the script you put in /System/Library/StartupItems/ executable and owned by root? <comment183977> MBP 5,1 is a [Late 2008 model](http://www.everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/?search_keywords=MacBookPro5,1). <comment183978> That said the age of the machine is irrelevant to what you are trying to do. It's the OS that would determine if something will work or not, and running shell scripts at login should not be an issue in Yosemite. <comment184194> @tron_jones: Yes the script is executable and owned by root because it configures a network interface. I set the executable bit on it, I believe that's what you do, <comment184203> If the script is to run as root at startup, this needs to be put in /Library/LaunchDaemons. LaunchAgents run when a user logs in, as that user. <comment184204> Why not just set it in the Network pane of System Preferences, like normal? <comment184323> @Gordon: Because the reason for this exercise is that the network preferences will not set it for me. <comment184346> @JeffK: The network prefs should be able to handle this just fine. Is there some particular reason you can't use a manually-configured IP address for the ethernet service, or that it doesn't work right? <comment209580> So where does the "every 60 seconds" come from? <comment209803> Sorry, forget to include a couple of lines. The "every 60 secons" comes from the line with `StartInterval` and the following value is the time in seconds. <comment219746> it doesnt work !
