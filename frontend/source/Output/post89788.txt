How to share a very large voice memo to Dropbox from iPod? <body> I am a college student and have recorded an interview for a speech assignment on my iPod. It is too large to email (about 24min). I have Dropbox on my iPod but when I try to "share" the voice memo, Dropbox is not an option. I don't have a computer to sync my iPod either.   What can I do to get this turned in?  <answer89792> Since you only have two sharing options in Voice Memos (Email, Message), you are obviously limited to those two things (clearly excluding a computer which you don't have access to).   Caveat: the following steps worked for me, but I didn't have a super-large voice memo to test it with.  ol liTurn off "Send as SMS" in Settings.app - Messages (if enabled)./li liOpen Voice Memos.app and select the memo you want to share./li liTap "Share", and select "Message"./li liType in a embogus/em number. ul liThis shouldn't be hard because we just limited our playing field to only iMessage users by turning off SMS alternate. The goal is to strongnot/strong reach someone obviously./li /ul/li liHit send./li liYou should receive an error message that the message failed to send. em(Perfect.)/em/li liTap the memo, and then select the "Share" icon in the upper right corner./li liSelect "Open in DropBox"./li /ol  <answer225829> Thankfully now strongSave to Dropbox/strong appears as an action in the share sheet.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kCBJu.png" alt="Voice Memos app Share sheet"  <comment105486> Very nice hack. I usually push it through iMessage to the end, but your's is a better "hack".
