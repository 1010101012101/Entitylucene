The kernel is dumping a bunch of diagnostics since one of the hundreds of processes that run all the time had a hiccup and the system couldn't tell you anything more helpful.  It's easy to have a language where you can describe nonsense or illogical ideas. Computers are math based, so if you tell them to divide 5 things by 0 an error arrives. Unless the programmer has considered that this error could happen and writes code to handle those exact errors, the kernel is the last line of defense and it has told you it's giving up and dumping information an engineer might be able to use to debug the problem.  emIf I was that engineer, I would notice that spotlight's strongmdworker/strong process might have been the last one in the vicinity where the crash was logged and that the last change to the kernel was unloading MSDOS extension, so I would ask you if you have any PC drives connected or ejecting and if this crash was actually within 8 minutes (505 seconds) from the time the Mac was started./em  Another high level analogy is if your car stalls, try starting it up again. Only if it's stalling in a repeated way or you have other needs (like you're driving the president around) would you try to fix it yourself or hire a team of engineers to know what to do. In your case, we would need to know a lot about what you have connected to the Mac, if you can boot from a clean install of the OS, if you have expertise or time to troubleshoot this or if you just want assurance on what to do next.

I would say it is a driver conflict, but do not know which one. You are not showing all the drivers in the report, specially the non apple ones. <comment112386> any of the external software could be the problem like the Air Display, DisplayLink, Logitech Control Center, Sunflower ect. <comment112387> Try the cmd-R to get in the repair mode and work from there.
