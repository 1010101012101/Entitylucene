Why do I have /Volumes/Storage Drive? <body> In Terminal, I noticed I have code/Volumes/Storage Drive/code. On my mac, I have no drive named codeStorage Drive/code. Furthermore, no codeStorage Drive/code appears in Finder or Disk Utility. When I codecd/code inside codeStorage Drive/code and codels -a/code, it is empty.  What is this code/Volumes/Storage Drive/code? Why is it not appearing in Finder or Disk Utility? Can I safely get rid of it?  The output of codedf/code does not show the code/Volumes/Storage Drive/code:  pre jerzy@jerzys-mbp $ df Filesystem                                                 512-blocks      Used  Available Capacity  iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2                                                467182912 392156184   74514728    85% 49083521    9314341   84%   / devfs                                                             419       419          0   100%      725          0  100%   /dev /dev/disk1s2                                               1464477344 296803024 1167674320    21% 37100376  145959290   20%   /Volumes/Storage map -hosts                                                          0         0          0   100%        0          0  100%   /net map auto_home                                                       0         0          0   100%        0          0  100%   /home localhost:/-ZOSLTsDfGt2NKFW5Q-SUw                           467182912 467182912          0   100%        0          0  100%   /Volumes/MobileBackups //jerzy@Jerzy%E2%80%99s%20Mac%20mini._smb._tcp.local/jerzy  975093952  72910968  902182984     8%        0 18446744073709551615    0%   /Volumes/jerzy /pre  Here is the output of codediskutil list/code:  pre jerzy@jerzys-mbp:/Volumes|â‡’  diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Primary                 239.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Storage                 749.8 GB   disk1s2 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *16.0 MB    disk2    1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            16.0 MB    disk2s2 /pre  If it helps to know this: I have a 250GB SSD (mounted to code//code), and a 750GB HDD (mounted to code/Storage/code).  <answer161859> Chances are, it's just a folder created randomly by some app or another at some point to use as a mount point and it was never deleted. It should be perfectly safe to coderm -rf/code it, especially if it is empty.  <answer227072> Adobe did this perhaps, while updating Flash Player or playing online games which using Flash.
