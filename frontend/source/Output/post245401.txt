If you do want to develop, you can buy a 4th gen.   h1Do I have to develop everything via iOS swift/Objective-C?/h1  Nope, Apple TV runs tvOS which have its own SDK. But the frameworks are very similar. tvOS also got some of its own SDK which iOS don't have. You do need to develop in Swift or Objective-C.  h1Can I test/install my app without a paid developer membership ?/h1  Yes, Xcode 7 allows you to test app on device without paid account. Though to install app on Apple TV, you will need an USB-C cable.  <answer245467> The short answer if you have a 3rd generation Apple TV.  You can't.  If you want to develop apps for an Apple TV you need the current 4th Generation Apple TV, A Mac with Xcode 7.1.1 or higher and some knowledge of Swift and/or Objective-C (probably go for Swift that's what all the cool kids are doing these days).
