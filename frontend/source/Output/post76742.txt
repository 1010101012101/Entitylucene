Turn main screen off when watching full screen video on TV <body> I connect my Mac via an HDMI adapter to my TV to watch films.  Is there a way to turn off my Mac's screen while watching those?   <answer76773> Decrease brightness to the lowest level would be the best option for me.  There are many other solitons in this thread.
