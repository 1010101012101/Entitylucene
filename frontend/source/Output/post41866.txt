LaunchBar script that returns the path of a folder "dropped" on it <body> I want to make a LaunchBar script that displays in a dialog the path of a file or folder that's chosen in the first pane and then "dropped" on a script. But I can't make it work.  I've got a couple of working scripts that almost do what I want:  Return contents of first pane (used with a shortcut):  precodetell application "LaunchBar"    set x to selection as text    return x end tell /code/pre  Display text written in the first pane and "dropped" on the script:  precodeon handle_string(textFromLaunchbar)    tell application "LaunchBar"        display in large type textFromLaunchbar    end tell end handle_string /code/pre  The latter uses the handle_string() handler but I can't quite make the open() handler work for files and folders:  from the LaunchBar manual:   http://www.obdev.at/resources/launchbar/help/index.php?chapter=SendingItems  Sending items to AppleScripts  To pass a selected file, URL or text to an AppleScript, press the Tab key to trigger the “Send to…” action, select the desired AppleScript and press Return. Files will be passed to the script’s open() handler, URLs will be passed to the handle_string() handler.  <answer41890> The codeopen()/code handler gets passed an codealias/code (which is a kind of a pointer to a file or folder). You can then simply convert the alias to text, but it will show you the path with colons as separators (e.g. "Macintosh HD:Users:Username:Documents:Folder:").  Use codePOSIX path of/code to convert it to a UNIX-style path with "/" separators, and if you want to paste it into Terminal, especially if the path has spaces in it, you should use codequoted form of/code to properly enclose it in quotes.  The following script works with both folders and files for me, when an item is passed to it via LaunchBar:  precodeon open (thisItem)     display dialog (thisItem as text) -- alias     display dialog quoted form of POSIX path of thisItem -- POSIX path end open /code/pre  <answer127057> I see you know about LaunchBar's "large type" feature -- did you know you can send selected text to it with the "Display in Large Type" action? I.e.  ol liSelect your file in LaunchBar/li liTab, "dla", return/li /ol  <comment47526> this works for me too, thank you! <comment47569> Are you trying to use the path in another application? If so, Cmd-C on the file in LaunchBar will put the POSIX path to the file on the clipboard, no need for AppleScript. <comment47620> no, but that's a very useful little trick
