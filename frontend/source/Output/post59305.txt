How to set default homepage in safari 6? <body> Since downloading mountain lion and safari 6 I have lost the ability to set my home page.  in safari preferences there is the ability to tell it what you want for a home page but it does not take.  instead I always get this:  http://d3.zedo.com/jsc/d3/ff2.html?n=790;c=3603;s=2952;d=16;w=1024;h=768.  I want to know how to get rid of this and get my preference working instead.  <answer59309> Two options come to mind:  ol liReset Safari (in Safari menu), restart the application and try again/li liQuit Safari, rename code~/Library/Safari/code to code~/Library/Safari.old/code and try again/li /ol  If the second options work, quit Safari again and copy codeBookmarks.plist/code from codeSafari.old/code to the newly created codeSafari/code folder.  <answer59332> Well I'm sure this isn't the easiest way to do it, but it should work!  ol liNavigate to /Users/yourname/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist/li liOpen com.apple.Safari.plist/li liFind the "HomePage" key/li liGo into the value column for the "HomePage" key and set it to the desired homepage.
