Is there any command I can use to disable brightness adjustments? <body> Is there any terminal command or script I can use to disable brightness adjustment system wide? I currently manage a large network of computers for a school district and we are looking for an easy solution to disable access to that functionality.  <answer136347> The following AppleScript will turn the brightness all the way up and then disable adaptive brightness.  precodetell application "System Preferences"     -- launch     -- activate     set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.displays"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of current pane     tell application "System Events"         tell process "System Preferences"             tell group 1 of tab group 1 of window 1                 set value of slider 1 to 1.0 -- max                 tell checkbox 1                     if value is 1 then click                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell     quit -- optional end tell /code/pre  Source.  <answer136463> You might also run  codecurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serverhorror/brightness/master/brightness.c&gt;brightness.c;gcc -std=c99 -o /usr/local/bin/brightness brightness.c -framework IOKit -framework ApplicationServices/code  and then add  precode* * * * * /usr/local/bin/brightness -v 0.5 /code/pre  to crontab to reset the brightness to 50% every minute.  You can disable the brightness keys with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;custom&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;custom&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN, KeyCode::VK_NONE&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP, KeyCode::VK_NONE&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment161727> Is there any way to disable non-administrators ability to use the keyboard buttons? <comment161731> I don't believe so, short of remapping those function keys to other keys with a tool such as [KeyRemap4MacBook](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/). You might be able to get away with enabling the setting `Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys` in System Preferences - Keyboard. The second option wouldn't *disable* those keys, but might confuse a user into not knowing how to change the brightness. <comment161787> In all my years managing computers in schools, I've never had the need to disable this feature. Are students misbehaving by dimming the monitors?
