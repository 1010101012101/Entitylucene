Adding external ram to 2014 MacBook Pro <body> I'm new to macs so please bear with me if I say something dumb.  I recently switched over to Mac, and purchased a new MacBook Pro, but found that the computer did not have enough ram for everything I am doing (large photoshop files etc.) I was wondering if there is any way that I could get external ram or some type of upgrade for my computer.   Essentially, can I get an external ram drive, or should I go back and upgrade the computer itself?  <answer163190> I'm sorry, but no, you can't upgrade.  <answer163191> The internal RAM is soldered to the motherboard (i.e. totally user-untouchable), but for external RAM, you're welcome to check out this article at your own risk.  UPDATE: After having done some research, apparently RAM disks are exactly the opposite of what I'd thought. They actually turn a segment of your RAM into hard drive space. It still promises massive speed boosts, though, so you should give it a try if you're up for it!  <comment191010> Retina or non-Retina MacBook Pro? If it's one of the Retina models, there's no way to upgrade the internal RAM. <comment191011> It is retina, but what about any external solutions? <comment191013> The pre-edit instructions you listed were for the non-Retina MBP... :) <comment191015> @user24601 yea, that's non upgradable.
