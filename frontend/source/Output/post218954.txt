iPhone music deleted and can't sync music from iTunes <body> I was listening to music in my car one day when all of a sudden the music stopped playing and all the music on my iPhone 6s Plus was gone.  I have now plugged my phone into the computer to put the music back onto my phone from the iTunes library on my computer and it won't upload. The only option it gives me under the music tab when my phone is plugged in is for synching voice notes. I have it checked in the settings that I only want selected playlists and songs to be on my phone and I have several selected.  I am a little confused what the problem is?  <comment264843> I'd try either changing the playlists & resyncing, or if no joy, do a restore.
