How to upload many iPhone photo albums to iPhoto, Picasa or Google+? <body> I'm back from trip to Egypt with 1600 pics on my iPhone. To maintain some coherence and not to lose track of everything I was seeing, I created daily or place specific folders on the iPhone.  I can go back and use the iPhone as guidance for manual album creation, but if I could just grab these albums would save a ton on time.  Is there any way to transfer these albums (not just the camera roll) to iPhoto, Picasa or Google+?  <answer39953> As a starting point you can export the photos into iPhoto and create events defined by date. You can then split the event as necessary to break out specific locations. Or use tags and smart albums to create subsets of photos for specific locations.
