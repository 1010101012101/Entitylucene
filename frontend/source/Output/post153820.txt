You chose to set up a user for services only and then tried to login as that user. Of course it's going to fail.  Services-only is for users that need calendar, email, time machine etc. but not login. If you want to do a basic login that user needs a home folder.  <answer153829> When you set a user to services only this limits them to no login.  As you can see in your Advanced Options the login shell is set to strong/usr/bin/false/strong.  This will deny login.  If you want to share a folder with them setup File Sharing in the Server.app and give them permission to the file share.  <comment181024> Well, but I want to just share folders with them.
