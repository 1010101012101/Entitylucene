How do I move my plants vz zombies safegames to android? <body> I want to try strategies here  https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/162404/is-there-a-way-to-transfer-game-progress-from-an-ios-device-to-android  I am now on android. I want to move app data from iphone to android.  The problem is, alas, I already upgraded to iOS 8.3. Ifunbox no longer can do that without jailbreaking.  What should I do?  I can jailbreak (if so, how)  Or, can I just back up everything to iTunes and then copy the back up data to andorid? I rooted my android already.  <comment293854> What version of iOS are you running? You mention iOS 8.3, but I can't tell if you're saying that you upgraded to 8.3 or if you upgraded *past* 8.3. <comment293895> http://adriansieber.com/how-to-extract-data-from-ios-apps-on-mac-os/ <comment294434> I had ios 8.3 a long time ago.
