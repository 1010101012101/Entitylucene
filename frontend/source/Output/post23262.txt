Dynamically (automatically) change the "download folder" in Safari <body> Saft -- the (now seemingly defunct as of Safari 5.1) Safari plugin -- had the ability to change the name of the download folder (and create said folder if it didn't already exist) that Safari uses (e.g., by creating a name based on the date).  This was incredibly useful for decluttering/ordering my downloads.  Is there any comparable feature in a supported Safari extension (for Safari 5.1)?  P.S.  I know I can create a cron job to do this after the fact, but that seems kludgey and prone to errors because of file timestamps, automatically unpacked ZIP/tar/cpio files, etc.  <answer23284> I am using the Glims Safari Plugin (ver1.0b29) in Safari 5.1 (OSX Lion), which has the feature "Create dated folder for downloaded files".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y79ZJ.png" alt="Create dated folder for downloaded files in Glims"  <answer23289> I created my own "S/W Downloads" folder and put it in the Dock.  I have it show as List, and there is an option to display by date, the newest being on top.  If that is sufficient, there is no need for Saft.  <answer126905> just Control click the download link  <answer235270> With the demise of Glims support (beyond Mavericks?), I broke down and wrote a cron job to automatically change the default download folder of Safari.  The crontab entries look like:  precode@reboot $HOME/bin/rotateDownloads 0 0 * * * $HOME/bin/rotateDownloads /code/pre  The contents of coderotateDownloads/code looks like:  precode#! /bin/ksh  NEWPATH=$HOME/downloads/$(date +%Y-%m-%d) mkdir -p ${NEWPATH} &amp;&amp; defaults write com.apple.Safari DownloadsPath ${NEWPATH}`#! /bin/ksh OLDPATH=$HOME/downloads/$(date -v -1d +%Y-%m-%d) rmdir ${OLDPATH} &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1  # remove old directory if empty /code/pre  This seems to work on El Capitan (MacOS 10.11.4) with Safari 9.1.  <comment25960> I've not yet used it, but just found that glims (http://www.machangout.com/)  advertises this feature (and that it is supported on Safari 5.1).  Anyone with experience/alternatives? <comment148725> and then do what? <comment285401> Apparently glims is not supported on El Capitan (10.11) <comment335276> Im on El Capitan 10.11.6 and Glims is still working with Safari 10.0.2. Some features don't seem to be working, but the Dated Folders part is working fine. Cheers.
