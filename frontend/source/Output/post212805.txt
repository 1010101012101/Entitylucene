Pages: How to put a word between horizontal rules <body> How can I make something that looks like this?  --------   Text   ---------  where the horizontal rules extend to the margin on either side?  <answer212812> ———————————————————————Now is the time——————————————  I don't know if it helps, I use Pages quite a lot, and when I run into layout problems I tend to resort to a Text Box. Then place/extend the box to whatever I require. Use the Arrange function, Object placement, "Stay on Page". Text Wrap, "None", Allowing me to move the box to required location. Also with the facility of moving the box, close to or over any other object or typing.  <answer212883> With strongPages/strong it helps to think in terms of layers.  Combinations of Text Boxes and Line graphics layered and arranged, should achieve the desired result.  Determine beforehand if the graphic and text box should cause wrapping and/or move with the rest of the text in the document or remain static.  h3Create a Horizontal Rule with Text Centered/h3  ul liAdd a strongLine/strong graphic to the canvas (Just one line will do)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TQsCr.png" alt="Add Graphic to document"  ul liPosition the line horizontally to the desired width/li liSet the strongObject Placement/strong properties in the strongArrange/strong tab on the strongInspector/strong as desired./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7Ieb.png" alt="Object placement inspector"  ul liAdd a strongText Box/strong setting the strongText/strong style Alignment properties to Center and Middle/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GXQkD.png" alt="Text box inspector settings"  ul listrongemIMPORTANT:/em/strong Change the background color from emNone/em to a color matching your document's background.

Some of them can be explored by examining the built in templates.  <comment369857> Nice & simple ;).
