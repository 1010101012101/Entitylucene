How can I assign a customisable mouse button to open Notification Center? <body> I want to set my mouse's customisable button to open Notification Centre on OS X Mountain Lion.  Is this possible?  <answer57440> Depending on your mouse and driver software, your best bet would probably be to set a keyboard shortcut for Notification Center and program your mouse button to trigger that shortcut.  You can set up the shortcut in System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts - Show Notification Center. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kuDh4.png" alt="enter image description here"  The setup for your mouse driver will vary, but on a Razer mouse you can assign the button to a Keyboard Function and type your shortcut.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hUbEH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer58970> If you don't have customizable mouse software, you can write an AppleScript to perform the keystroke and then attach the mouse button to the script.  The script I used is:  precodetell application "System Events" to keystroke "N" using {command down, control down, option down, shift down} /code/pre  You will have to adjust the keystroke and the modifier keys to suit whatever you set in the Keyboard Shortcuts preference pane.  Save the script as an application bundle, then stick it somewhere (I put it in code~/Library/Scripts/code). Adjust your mouse button in System Preferences to open the application bundle.  <answer66319> You could also use BetterTouchTool paired with an Apple keyboard shortcut as shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dG4Wi.png" alt="BTT Settings" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qdxUy.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts"  <comment65978> Welcome to Ask Different! What make/model is your mouse and what driver software are you using? Are you talking about the scroll wheel button or a different button? <comment68518> USBOverdrive is great as a generic customisable mouse driver.
