How to fix Photoshop CS3 startup error "One or more files in the Adobe Application Support folder" after upgrading to 10.6? <body> After upgrading to 10.6 (Snow Leopard) Adobe Photoshop gives an error message on every start of the application:     "One or more files in the Adobe Application Support folder, necessary   for running Photoshop, are missing. Please run the Phtoshop installer   and re-install Photoshop."   How to fix this Photoshop CS3 on every launch error "One or more files in the Adobe Application Support folder" message that start occurring after upgrading to 10.6?  <answer59442> The problem is that code/Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax/code isn’t loading. It’s possible the file is actually missing, but it’s more likely that you’ve upgraded to Snow Leopard.  Snow Leopard requires 64-bit versions of every plug-in, including OSAXes. The versions of Adobe Unit Types that shipped with CS3 and CS4 are 32-bit.  To fix this:  ol liDownload the 64-bit version of Adobe Unit Types./li liDelete the old code/Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types/code file (when it's there)./li liDrag the downloaded codeAdobe Unit Types.osax/code file to your code/Library/ScriptingAdditions//code folder./li liLaunch Photoshop./li /ol  sources:  ul lihttp://paulschreiber.com/blog/2010/11/02/howto-fix-photoshops-missing-application-support-files-error//li lihttp://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/unit-type-conversion-error-applescript.html/li /ul  <answer214197> This has happened to me before when I reinstalled Leopard and upgraded to Snow Leopard 10.6. When I tried to double-click or drag and drop to Photoshop the files wouldn't open. I looked in the emLibrary/em folder and there was no emScriptingAdditions/em folder.   So, I went to my Time Machine backup folders (on my external drive) and chose a backup folder  from 3 days ago. Opened emLibrary/em and found emScriptingAdditions/em folder, which contained the Adobe Types Unit file. Dragged the ScriptingAdditions folder to my desktop and then put it in the upper level Library of my hard drive. Works every time.   <comment258566> Did you mean reinstall Leopard and upgrade to SL? Because reinstall SL and upgrade to SL doesn't make much sense.
