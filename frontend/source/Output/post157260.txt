Notifications on dual monitors: how can I specify which monitor? <body> I would like to have notifications on my left monitor and not my right monitor. It's hard to see them when I'm looking at the left monitor (since they're all the way on the right side and they're rather large monitors).  Is there any way to keep the screens in this order but have the notifications appear on the screen I want them to appear on?  <answer183163> You should be able to do this by choosing the monitor on which the menu bar is active. Try - System Settings - Displays - Arrangement and drag the little white bar to the monitor where you want the notifications to show up.  <answer295740> The notification side-tray should appear on the screen which your cursor is currently positioned;  it need not be the screen with the active menu bar... I've found that it isn't always consistent, and sometimes appears on whichever screen it last appeared. I was able to sync it up to the expected behavior by opening and closing the tray from the menu bar icon rather than trackpad gesture.  <comment374132> Wow this isn't at all obvious.
