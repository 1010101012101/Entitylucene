Applescript and Shell: how do I insert a variable? <body> I'm using the following code to set a Philips Hue bulb with specific hue, saturation and brightness using Applescript.  It works perfectly.  precode   set TurnOnBulbA to the quoted form of "{\"on\": true,\"hue\": 65535, \"sat\": 240,\"bri\": 90}" /code/pre  I'd like to add a random color option.  This seems like it should insert a random number for the hue setting, but instead, it inserts the name of the variable:  precodeset RandomNumA to (random number from 0 to 65535)  set TurnOnBulbA to the quoted form of "{\"on\": true,\"hue\": RandomNumA, \"sat\": 240,\"bri\": 90}" /code/pre  How do I insert the generated number of the variable instead of the name of the variablel?  The following probably isn't needed, but I'll include it in case it's helpful to anybody.  It's the code that completes the above for turning on a bulb:  precodedo shell script "curl --request PUT --data " &amp; TurnOnBulbA &amp; " http://myIPaddress/api/myhueID/lights/1/state/" /code/pre  <answer171067> You're embedding codeRandomNumA/code inside a literal (double-quoted) string, so it's treated as part of the literal rather than as a variable reference. To get it interpreted as a variable, you have to do the same thing you do in the codedo shell script/code command at the end -- use code&amp;/code to append a quoted literal, a variable reference, and another quoted literal. Actually, it's slightly more complicated because you have to use parentheses to make sure the whole thing gets codequoted form of/code applied to it:  precodeset RandomNumA to (random number from 0 to 65535)  set TurnOnBulbA to the quoted form of ("{\"on\": true,\"hue\": " &amp; RandomNumA &amp; ", \"sat\": 240,\"bri\": 90}") /code/pre  <comment201279> Man I feel so stupid.  THANK YOU!  Geez, I should have known that.  Tested and it works, of course.  Thanks so much!
