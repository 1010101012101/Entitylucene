Macbook air screen is too bright even on the lowest setting <body> Is there a tweak, hack, or piece of software that can adjust the brightness of the MacBook Air's screen below the settings that MacOS X allows by default?  In low light the lowest brightness setting is too bright for me (and the setting after that is black so that doesn't work at all). :-)  <answer13733> I use and recommend Shades (free), which can darken the screen beyond the built-in brightness control.  If you really want to get it darker, use the built-in shortcut kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd8/kbd to invert the screen colors (same command reverses the effect).  Nocturne (free) allows you to tweak some of the inversion settings.  <comment14590> Don't [cross-post](http://superuser.com/questions/280583/macbook-air-screen-is-too-bright-even-on-the-lowest-setting). Also, explain what's wrong with Flux and Nocturne? <comment14745> shades work absolutely perfect, thanks <comment14746> Flux and nocturne don't do what I want, I don't want invertion I want a dimmer screen. Didn't mean to x-post, just found out about apple.stackexchange too late. Shades tho is perfection. <comment14747> @Johan You're welcome -- glad I could help! <comment14760> Had you bothered to open Nocturne preferences, you would have seen the *Invert screen* checkbox, and quite a few others, right at the top. Leave only *Adjust screen brightness*, and it does what you want. Flux is actually more sophisticated, not doing brightness, but changing the perceived [color temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) of your screen.
