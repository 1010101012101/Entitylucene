MacBook Pro freezing a few programs (different each time) before resuming? <body> I have a 2012 MacBook Pro that is running OS 10.7.5 -- and it's behaving very strangely. I'm actually at a loss as to what to even search for. The best I can do is to link to a video I took of the laptop while it was behaving this way:   http://youtu.be/llTyJvfzItA  Summary of the behavior I'm seeing:   For about 10 minutes at a time, my computer will freeze 2 or 3 programs (they aren't always the same programs). Other programs can work without issue. After ~10 minutes everything suddenly starts working again (and actions that were attempted all get executed rapidly).   All of that behavior is shown in the video (see it start working again right at the end).   Weird things:   ol liChrome thinks that certain tabs are dead because it isn't getting a heartbeat (so it offers to kill the tab). Doing so, or not doing so does not matter./li liThe CPU and memory usage remains near idle level./li liOnly some programs are affected (because of this repeated behavior I've switched to Netscape and back to Chrome; from Textmate to Sublime Text; in attempts to isolate what could be happening. /li liIf I'm playing music through itunes, for example, sometimes when it freezes, it will halt the music until it resumes. Other times, it will continue to work./li /ol  Any help on figuring out what to do and what's causing it would be much appreciated!  h2EDIT/h2  By request here is the Console log around the time of the problem (I began filming at 17:46 so the problems around 17:40 are probably suspect) :   precode2014-05-05 17.40.12 5:40:12.474 PM com.jamfsoftware.task.Every 30 Minutes: Delaying 198 seconds... 2014-05-05 17.40.28 5:40:28.316 PM Evernote: CoreData: error:  (External Records Support): symlink from path /Users/jwhitmore/Library/Containers/com.evernote.Evernote/Data/Library/Application Support/Evernote/accounts/Evernote/jbwhitmore/Evernote.sql to path /Users/jwhitmore/Library/Containers/com.evernote.Evernote/Data/Library/CoreData/com.evernote.Evernote/24458A30-8292-4A14-8D69-EFBA68CA25EE/.support/store-file : Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=516 "The file “store-file” couldn’t be saved in the folder “.support” because a file with the same name already exists."
