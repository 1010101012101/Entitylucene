Will Lion download from Mac App Store resume if network connection interrupted? <body> I'm contemplating downloading it but I'm in an area prone to connectivity outages. Or does it install a pre-loader which then downloads the actual disk image (which I can curl)?  <answer18986> App applications downloaded from the App Store will automatically resume if your network service is interrupted. The Lion download is a DVD sized .dmg file that contains the OS, not a pre-loader.  If your download does get interrupted you can kbdcontrol/kbd + click on the Lion icon in your dock then click resume.   <comment20794> Thanks, Aaron, for sharing. Much appreciated. <comment20947> Unfortunately, experiences may vary...  My flaky Internet connection disconnects every now and then for a couple of seconds (every 200-300 downloaded megabytes approximately), just enough to make the download fail.  And, once every 2-3 times, the download starts from the beginning. <comment22611> I had a similar issue: with Lion about 40% downloaded, I allowed Software Update to reboot the system to apply the SL 10.6.8 upgrade.  When I logged back in, Lion started from 0%. :(
