How to "print" a web page to a PDF in Safari on iOS (iPad)? <body> In Google Chrome it is possible to codePrint.../code  codeGoogle Cloud Print/code  codeSave to Google Drive/code  ... This seems to work like a charm.  I would like to do the same thing in Safari. "Printing" a website to a PDF on some cloud service (e.g., Dropbox). Is this possible? For example, is it possible to add a cloud server to the codePrint/code  codeSelect Printer/code list?  (I have tried a bookmarklet approach before, but I don't fancy that.)  <answer120341> You can print to a Printopia printer which saves to Dropbox. Since Printopia printers are added to AirPrint and can save the printed document as PDF in a location, you can set it up to save to Dropbox as PDF, then you can get the PDF from the Dropbox app on your iPad. Sure, it's a bit of a workaround, but you do end  up with a PDF on your iPad!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5c1oo.png" alt="Printopia"  Alternatively, you can use handyPrint which can share printers as AirPrint printers, but you then need a separate Print to PDF printer for OS X, such as CUPS-PDF.  <answer263121> This is now possible on iOS 10 (and possibly earlier). It works for anything that can be printed  ul liTap the Share button (in Mail, this is in the Reply button)/li liThen Print/li liNow, pinch to zoom the preview (or with 3D touch, pop) to get a full-screen view of the print preview. This is actually a PDF of the view and has its own share pane, so you can, for example, email the PDF./li /ul  <comment140369> Thanks, looks perfect for the job. I think I'll give it a try. But still, $19.99. :( <comment140370> Added handyPrint — bit more of a 'manual' solution though (⤻ @Glen) <comment329672> I don't think this is correct.  I don't see any option on my iPad Air with iOS10 to print to PDF or email the doc.  I can see the Share button and choose `Print` but there's no options to print anywhere (PDF, email, or print). <comment329675> You missed the bit where you need to pinch to zoom the preview image... Once you get the preview to full screen, you'll see a share button (top-right on iPad) <comment348343> Sharing via mail just opens an email with a link for me.
