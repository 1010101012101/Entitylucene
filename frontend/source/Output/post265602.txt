Cannot shutdown/restart properly, force-quit fails, wunderlisthelper does not die <body> Alright, I had another initial post draft written, but then I just found something:  wunderlisthelper will not die...  strongkill -9/strong will cause it to reopen with stronganother pid/strong. I keep hard killing it, and it keeps jumping to a new process.   precode91617 ??         0:00.55 QA2G25RMZ4.com.wunderkinder.wunderlist-helper /code/pre  What is this?  The initial prob is that shutdown/restart will work if not logged in, but will not work if logged into any account. I've tried MANY methods to solve the issue - nothing yet. All other diagnostics (hardware and software) are good.   Also fwiw there is some trouble with force-quit other apps, but maybe unrelated.   <answer265608> wunderlisthelper runs in the background and restarts automatically due to the loaded launch agent. You can disable it from Wunderlist preferences.                      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9a43l.png" alt=""  <comment333400> Alright, with troubleshooting exhaustion I was hoping I found the problem. Keep going... Thanks for the answer
