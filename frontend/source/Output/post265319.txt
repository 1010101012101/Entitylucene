BASH script works when executed from terminal but not from Finder <body> precode#!/bin/bash  declare -a appids=("399220" "399080" "399480") for i in "${appids[@]}" do     screen -dmS app-$i ./run-idle $i     sleep 3     screen -S app-$i -X quit done pkill steam-idle /code/pre  As far as I can tell the screens are just not opening at all, I've looked on stack and some other places but I'm not exactly sure what to look for. I've never really used macOS before just Debian but I'd like to get this working from Finder for ease-of-use.  If I use a terminal window and just execute it with code./start.sh/code everything is fine, it runs, start and closes the screens and kills the extra processes created at the end. But from Finder, it simply echos that they finished and it's complete and nothing opens, neither the screens or processes that the screen should have opened.
