How do I remove a username from the username drop down list on Chrome on Mac OS X? <body> Googling suggests that I highlight the name with my mouse and hit delete - this doesn't work (the name stays in the dropdown list, I instead end up deleting a letter from the name textfield)  A Mac specific suggestion is to hold down the "fn" button when I click delete. Trying that seems to have no effect - nothing changes, that I can see.  How do I remove a specific username from the username drop down on Google Chrome on Mac?  hr  To all the answers suggesting kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdDelete ⌫/kbd It is an editor shortcut for "quick delete entire line". So it only emlooks/em like it works.  It does strongemnot/em/strong add/modify/delete names from the list of login names that are suggested for autofill.  Please test your answer before posting - make strongemsure/em/strong that the auto-fill list is actually different after you've deleted a name.  <answer99508> Was actually having the same trouble and decided to try a combination of kbdfn/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbddelete/kbd  <answer99515> Running Chrome v28 on OS X 10.8.4, by selecting an entry in a dropdown of saved usernames, I was able to kbdfn/kbd+kbdDelete ⌫/kbd and remove the incorrect name.  <answer102096> highlight the name with the mouse and hitkbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd. It worked for me.  <answer104516> The Ctrl+Shift+Delete worked for me. When the drop down options appear, use arrow keys to highlight the option you want to delete, then Ctrl+Shift+Delete removes that option.  <comment113833> If you mean account information saved in a keychain, you can delete it from Keychain Access. <comment113859> @LauriRanta No, not that - just the list of login names that show up for the name field on forms. I'd like to edit the list, not blow away all of them. <comment113873> @blueberryfields I think you meant autofill in data. You can click Ctrl+, which goes to Preferences there you can click on clear browsing data. There you can select the check box "Clear saved Autofill form data". <comment113877> @garikapati As I've said in the question and in my comment above, I'm explicitly looking to edit the list of login names, not to blow away all of them. <comment117071> And did it work? <comment117093> are you sure that it's removed from the list? what happens if you start typing names again? When I try this, the name that's in the text box is deleted, but doesn't appear to be permanently removed from the auto-fill list. <comment120256> It would help if you can elaborate on your answer and provide detailed steps. <comment151381> This worked for me! <comment197265> Type something on the address bar.  The hint appears.  Click down arrow until the item you want to delete is highlighted.  Then, click fn+shift+delete. <comment298980> My rep isn't enough to leave an answer: To clear usernames or emails from login forms in chrome - go to chrome preferences, look for "Manage passwords".  You can filter by domain.  Delete the accounts from there.
