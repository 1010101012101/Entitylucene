Double click windows to minimise in Lion? <body> Before upgrading to Lion I was able to double-click the header bar of windows to minimise the windows. Since upgrading I only seem to be able to minimise by clicking the yellow code-/code button.  Is this a setting that I'm missing?  <answer18087> Go to System Preferences  General. Check "Double-click a window's title bar to minimize".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ganU0.png" alt="Minimize"  <comment19755> What apps have you tried this with? It works fine for me in all my apps... <comment19759> Safari is the one I'm noticing the most, just tested Twitter for Mac and it's the same. <comment19763> Great, worked perfectly. Thanks! <comment19903> Interesting that this got unchecked when you upgraded. I'm always surprised by which settings get lost :/
