Repeated logging in console <body> On macOS Sierra I am seeing the following logged every 3 seconds.   precodelogd[67]: _handle_cache_delete_with_urgency(0x7f939281eb80, 3, 0) logd[67]: _volume_contains_cached_data(is /private/var/db/diagnostics/ in /) - YES logd[67]: 186377856 bytes of purgeable space from log files logd[67]: _purge_uuidtext only runs at urgency 0 (3) logd[67]: 0 bytes of purgeable space from uuidtext files /code/pre  I rebooted into Recovery mode (Command-R during boot) and ran Disk Utility First Aid, with no change in behaviour.  With each run of First Aid I received the following in the Disk Utility list of messages:  precoderesizing core storage logical volume structures ... resized core storage logical volume ... growing file system /code/pre  Which seems odd that each run of First Aid would cause a change to the core storage system.  I'm concerned all of these messages in the log suggests I may have a disk error. Can I safely ignore these? Is my disk failing, or is this normal to have my log files flooded with messages every 3 seconds?  <answer256320> It turns out iStat Menus was the culprit. Upgrading to the latest version resolved the issue.  <comment319665> We like answers to be more than just a single line.  Ideally, you want to explain why your answer is *right."
