Can I use my iPhone as a GPS receiver? <body> I would like to use my iPhone as a GPS receiver.  So here's the setup and the goal, I'm open to suggestions.  I am developing an Android app that uses GPS.  Unfortunately, my office is in the middle of a building where GPS is unavailable.  But my iPhone can get a fix pretty much anywhere in the building, but its especially good near the windows.  There is a window within bluetooth range of my office.  My development environment has both Windows and OS X machines.  I have several iPads available, a couple Raspberry Pis, an iPhone, and just the one Android tablet.  As nearly all these mobile devices have GPS built-in, I would prefer not to spend any additional money on a solution.  So my question is:  Can I use my iPhone as a GPS receiver?  Is it possible to designate the iPhone as a embluetooth/em GPS receiver?  If not, some round-about solution would be fine.. for example, iPhone GPS sent to MacBook, which then pretends to be a bluetooth GPS receiver?  <comment337898> Just a thought (not sure if this works). Can you use the iPhone 'hotspot'  connect as WIFI on android device and location will load the GPS?
