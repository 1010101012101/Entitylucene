Alert sound on the hour, every hour (OSX and iOS) <body> Both my Mac and iPhone (possibly my iPad, not sure) play an alert sound on the top of every hour (I believe -- certainly a few of the hours). I don't use notifications for anything (that I am aware of). How do I stop the sound?  The weirdest thing is that I can't find evidence of anyone else having problems with this.  <answer115287> One possibility ... in OS X  in System Preferences  Date &amp; Time  Clock, you can set such notifications.  <answer115599> You've checked the codeAnnounce time/code option in codeClock/code tab in codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Date &amp; Time/code.  Uncheck it to silent your Mac. Regarding iPhone, there is no such option until and unless you've set the notifications for an app to behave like that.  Please check the image below for reference img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnVkI.png" alt="screenshot of Date &amp; Time settings"  <answer233256> For ios you can try app like "EveryHour Alarm" (https://itunes.apple.com/app/id963108472)  <comment134961> Nice try, but no dice I'm afraid ;-) <comment134963> Do you use any calendaring apps? Does anything show on the screen (on either device) when this alarm goes off? What else have you observed when this happens? <comment134998> If you set this, do you get two chimes? <comment136575> That's not it I'm afraid... <comment136576> Good idea -- I'll try that. <comment226394> I am also having this issue...@ the 58th min of the hour though? It is not even a sound I thought was on my phone and it is freaking me out.
