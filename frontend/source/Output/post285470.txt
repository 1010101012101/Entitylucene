Apple Pencil with Pages <body> I use Pages on my iPad pro and would like to edit using my new Apple Pencil - can anyone tell me how to get Pages to recognise the Apple Pencil? Would be very grateful.  <answer285476> Normally, you simply have to plug the Apple Pencil in your iPad and wait a couple seconds until it is detected...
