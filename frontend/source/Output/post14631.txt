Will I ever spoil my iPhone by placing it on top of my laptop? <body> Does anyone know if I will ever spoil my iPhone by placing it on top of my laptop?  I mean I don't know about these electronic/magnetic stuff and I want to know if there may be any problem putting them close together (especially when my laptop is running and heated)  <answer14646> Your iPhone will not spoil if placed on your laptop. Unless it is so hot that your iPhone warns you about its temperature.  Concerning the electronic/magnetic emstuff/em, your laptop will not give out that much amount of emstuff/em to spoil the iPhone, unless your laptop is a microwave.  <answer218075> Though it won't likely damage your laptop or phone, it's a general rule of thumb not to place two electronics on top of each other. Will you spoil your phone at that moment? Very low chances. Will you emever/em spoil your phone by doing it? Very high chances.  <comment15769> what do you mean that my iphone warns me about its temperature? <comment15770> [this picture](http://dailymobile.se/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/iphone_temperature_warning.jpg) says it all. <comment15795> btw i've got another question. in Singapore we have this ezlink-card scanner which we scan our ez-link card against whenever we enter the MRT. I always hold my phone and wallet together in 1 hand so i was wondering will there be any issues if the iphone gets "scanned" alongside the ez-link card? <comment15866> the chip in the ez-link card is not present in the iphone, and thus cannot be scanned. <comment15898> ok. i'd always thought there's a chance that the phone may go haywire if i put it through some electronic scanner
