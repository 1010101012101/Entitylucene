Exporting SMS messages from iPhone into plain text files <body> Can I get my SMS messages off my iPhone and into a plain text format?  I tried idevicebackup2 for libimodibledevice, but it doesn't work (error messages below).  Besides it seems to operate with an encryption password I don't know. Using Linux.  precodeMoving 128 files [==================================================]  99% Finished Moving 128 files [==================================================]  99% Finished Moving 128 files [==================================================]  99% Finished Moving 128 files [==================================================]  99% Finished Moving 128 files [==================================================] 100% Finished Moving 128 files [==================================================] 100% Finished Moving 128 files [==================================================] 100% Finished Moving 128 files [==================================================] 100% Finished Moving 128 files [==================================================] 100% Finished Moving 55 files [==================================================] 100% Finished Moving 1 file [==================================================] 100% Finished Moving 1 file [==================================================] 100% Finished [==================================================] 100% Finished Removing 1 file Could not remove 'iph/d342710805963ec35279371e6af9093234781262/Snapshot': Directory not empty (39) [==================================================] 100% Finished ErrorCode 104: Error removing snapshot directory (MBErrorDomain/104).
