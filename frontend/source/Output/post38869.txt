How do I evaluate multiple equations in a single cell? <body> I have two equations in a Numbers spreadsheet:  precodeCOUNTIF(PROMO,FALSE) COUNTIF(Purchases :: WL,FALSE) /code/pre  I need to merge these to satisfy one cell's value.  Something similar to codecountif( A &amp;&amp; B , false)/code.  How can I accomplish this?  <comment46016> Thanks for the edit. Still no response? <comment46024> Figured it out! Countifs() solved my issue. As for my original question, I just Have to format it together as `COUNTIFS(PROMO,"=False",WL,"=False")
