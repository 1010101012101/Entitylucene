How can I stop my iMac's remote management connection from defaulting to wifi? <body> I have two Mac computers that I connect to using Screen Sharing and when the Mac Mini's wifi is disabled I get great performance out of it. The problem that occurs is when I enable wifi on the Mac Mini and use screen sharing it appears to bypass the ethernet connection and use wifi instead to connect resulting in a slow connection. Is there any way to force the iMac to connect to my Mac Mini via ethernet instead of wifi when wifi is enabled on the Mac Mini?   <answer52026> In strongSystem Prefereces/strong  strongNetwork/strong set Ethernet above Wifi. That should do the trick.  <answer52383> Use the strongSystem Preferences  Network  Action (cog) menu  Set Service Order/strong to alter the default network.  You can change the strongService Order/strong of your network connections. The order tells Mac OS X to prefer one network connection over another.  Drag your Ethernet connection above your Wi-Fi connection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fekbp.png" alt="Service Order in Mac OS X 10.7&#39;s Network System Preference"
