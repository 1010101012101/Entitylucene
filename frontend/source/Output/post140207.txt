Trying to find what driver my printer is currently using on OS X <body> I have two Macs, and one (with Mavericks) is working with a Sharp printer no problem, the other Mac (also with Mavericks) on the same printer cannot print to it.   The mac having the problem can see the print can add it, and for all intents purposes it believes it is printing to it. I want to confirm what driver each Mac is using and I cannot locate that specifically. I have looked at all the drivers on each machine and they both look to have the same driver options on each computer.   So how to I tell which driver they are each currently using?
