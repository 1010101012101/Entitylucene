Run script in automator (without terminal) <body> After trawling through Stack Exchange and other forums for a few hours, I'm still not sure what I'm doing wrong!  cliclick automates mouse movements on macOS. When running the following command in terminal it runs/works as it's intended to.  precodecliclick w:750 m:2656,1138 w:750 m:2827,1000 /code/pre  However, I would like to create a .app to avoid running/opening the script in terminal.  When pasting my command into the Automator  Run Shell Script and testing the result is:   precodecliclick: command not found /code/pre  <answer282168> You probably installed codecliclick/code in code/usr/local/bin/code which is not part of the search path the emRun Shell Script/em action uses. To overcome this just specify the full path within the action  precode/usr/local/bin/cliclick w:750 m:2656,1138 w:750 m:2827,1000 /code/pre  <comment355260> Thanks for your quick reply! Works like a dream.
