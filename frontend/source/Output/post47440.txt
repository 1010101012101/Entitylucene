Alternative of `route -n` of Linux in Mac <body> How can I see the list of routes and its corresponding gateway in a Mac ? The command in linux is coderoute -n/code .  For a particular IP address, I am able to get the routes for an particular IP address via coderoute get 10.0.0.0/code.   <answer47442> I'm not at a Mac to play with terminal, but is codenetstat -rn/code what you need?
