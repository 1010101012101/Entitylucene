CLI: get CPU real speed (e.g. Intel SpeedStepping) <body> Can you query for the real CPU speed in OS X command line/terminal?  precode$ system_processor /code/pre  – only provides the hardware spec info.  precode$ sysctl hw.cpufrequency /code/pre  – only provides the hardware spec info.  precode$ sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu /code/pre  – this gives some good info.  But, nothing about real-time speed.  I see there is Intel's Power Gadget that provides an API in C++, so one could go that route.  But, I am looking for a lighter alternative that does not require a 3rd party full desktop app installed - just to read the CPU speed.  For example, on my ArchLinux boxes I can just run:  precode$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq /code/pre  ...to see the CPU speed.
