El Capitan Sharing & VMware <body> I have MacBook Pro with El Capitan 10.11.3 and VMware 6x installed on it with Windows 7.  I noticed that my MacBook Pro can be seen as network disk from Windows 7. I can see the personal folder as shared folder and all files in it.  How I can disable this? Also, can others see the same if they are in the local network with me strongor/strong worse in public?  I have disabled all from System settings - Sharing, nothing should be enabled  <comment275924> I tried to make question more clear :) <comment275925> Did you enable Sharing in OS X (System Preferences - Sharing)? <comment275926> No, there is no checked checkboxes.
