Numbers 4.0 missing <body> I just did a clean install of Sierra and migrated my settings from 10.11.6.  App Store showed a number of updates. I updated Pages to 6.0, but Numbers 4.0 only has an option to "Open".  When I click "Open" it starts Numbers '09 version 2.3.  I still have Numbers version 3.6.2 which I updated on 2 Sept.  How do I update to Numbers 4.0 ?  Additional Information: A couple of days ago my 10.11.6 stop showing Updates for Pages and Keynote, which I had not updated. (I still use older Pages, and will continue to do so until Pages catches up with the previous functionality.)  I no longer see Keynote offered as an update, but have never actually used.
