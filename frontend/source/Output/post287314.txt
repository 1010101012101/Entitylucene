macOS Sierra boot issue (forbidden sign) <body> I had three operating systems (Sierra, Windows 10 and Ubuntu) installed and decided to get rid of Windows .. so using Disk Utility I removed the Windows partition.   I wasn't able to boot anymore and I got "no bootable device press any key", following some troubleshooting practices I was able to boot into Mac white screen as default OS but after entering username and password I end up with the forbidden sign .. using Recovery Mode I find that within Disk Utility the old drive partition has a description with FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF.  <comment362739> This is a common error, but as you didn't actually copy/paste the correct FFFF's I can't find it... Please edit the actual name into your question <comment362745> FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFF Is that what you need ? <comment362753> There are plenty of q&a containing [FFFF...](https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF)... <comment362761> Indeed - though the search engine seems to be rather fussy over the number of F's :/
