Can't install El Capitan update 10.11.3 because can't restart normally <body> I've got the typical problem that OSX can't shutdown/restart normally. I'm on El Capitan but it happened in the past with Mavericks etc. Don't know why they can't fix this...  Anyway, now I want to install El Capitan update 10.11.3, the final step is it wants to restart the system.  I click the 'restart' button but the restart fails.  I can hard boot by holding down the power button... but then the update doesn't finish its install - it still says I need to restart if I go into App Store.  Restart or shutdown from the Apple menu don't work.  I tried a codeshutdown -r now/code from Terminal... this successfully restarts but the update still 'needs restart' when I go back in after booting.  MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012) El Capitan 10.11.2  <answer224892> I was able to complete the update by:  ul lihard shutdown (hold down power button)/li liboot into safe mode (hold down kbdshift/kbd when powering on)/li liopen App Store and click Restart for the uncompleted update/li /ul  was then able to restart successfully from safe mode, completing the update
