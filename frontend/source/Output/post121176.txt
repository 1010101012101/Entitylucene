Bug with the automator action "rotate an image" and tags <body> I have the following bug.  I have created a small app that rotates an image, with the help of codeautomator/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QOVMA.png" alt="image"  But when I apply this action to a file with tags, it removes all the tags of the file (by tag, I me am the codeFinder/code's tags, introduced in codeMavericks/code).  ul liCan you reproduce that bug?/li liWaiting for the bug to be removed, how can I do to keep tags when rotating (with automator)?/li /ul  <answer121200> Yes the Tags do get wiped on mine.  As an example of resetting them. You can collect the tags first apply your changes and then reset them after.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i6TqP.png" alt="enter image description here"  1, set the first strongSet Value of Variable/strong  to the file path (input)  :var named File  2, Pass the file path to a strongRun Applescript/strong : collecting the tag info.  This example works on a single file.  Code:  precodeon run {input, parameters} set tag to do shell script "xattr -px com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags" &amp; space &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of (item 1 of input) return tag /code/pre  end run  3, pass the result on to a strongSet Value of Variable/strong :var named tag  4, strongGet value of Variable/strong :var strongFile/strong:  ignore input from the above action.  5,Pass it onto the strongRotate Images/strong Action  6,strongGet value of Variable/strong :var strongtag/strong:  The image path from the Rotate Images Action will also be collected  by this action.   7, Pass the file path and tag array on to a strongRun Applescript/strong  precodeon run {input, parameters}      set theFile to item 1 of input     set theTags to item 2 of input     do shell script "xattr -wx com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags" &amp; space &amp; quoted form of theTags &amp; space &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of theFile  end run /code/pre  This is just an example which worked on my simple tests and you may want to test it on copies first.  <comment141237> By tags you mean the EXIF metadata ? <comment141239> By `tag` I mean the new tags of Mavrick <comment141558> Thanks, I did it, but it is not working. Can I email you my test, so that you see what's wrong. Could you give me a hint on how to do it for several images? Thanks. <comment141587> You can leave a comment on my blog. Which will give me an email address from you. I can reply to it and you can then use the reply email address. This will mean neither of our email addresses are posted here. And email addresses are not shown on my blog.  http://www.markosx.com/thecocoaquest/ <comment141609> I have added your blog to my bookmarks. Thanks. <comment141612> You missed a space out in the first applescript. I have updated to include it in a better way
