Autocomplete is broken in Google Chrome <body> I use Google Chrome as browser. I like the feature that it autocompletes the web-address when I start to type. e.g. when typing "app" it's autocompleted to "apple.stackexchange.com" and I just need to press enter.  But now the autocomplete feature seem to be broken on Mac OS X for me. It works fine on Windows. Now on Mac OS X when I start to type an address it is autocompleted, but just for a small part of a second, then the autocompletion disappear, so I never have the change to press Enter so I can use the autocompletion.  How can I fix this? Is there any settings I can change? or is it a bug?  This didn't work on version 12.0.742.112 and it doesn't work in the current version (13.0.782.107).  <answer16737> Try this (strongreference/strong):  precodeTurning on/off Auto-Suggestions 1.

The suggestion is shown, but only for a very short period and then disappear. <comment18299> Sounds like you may have found a bug (http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35309).
