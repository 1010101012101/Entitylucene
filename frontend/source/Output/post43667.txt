iOS Simulator installed apps location in Xcode 4.3.1 <body> Where can I find the apps installed on the iOS Simulator?  I am running Xcode 4.3.1. I have found the location of the simulator at   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone Simulator.app  but for the life of me I can't find the installed apps.  <answer43670> On my computer, it's code~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Applications/code  Simple codeNSLog(@"%@", [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath]);/code did the trick.  <answer46661> I had the same issue and then realized that my whole iPhone Simulator directory was now under my User folder:  precode/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Applications/[app guid] /code/pre  The one trick with that was that the Library folder was a hidden folder, which I was able to see after turning hidden folders on in system prefs.  <comment53347> To make the user `Library` folder visible again: `chflags nohidden ~/Library` <comment54192> Yes, thanks for that.
