mvim (MacVim 7.4) opening new windows rather than tabs (Mac OS X 10.8.5) <body> I am using the above and editing new files using codemvim &lt;filename&gt;/code. The first time after I installed mvim in the /usr/local/bin directory it seemed to open files in new tabs by default, this behaviour has now stopped.  h2I would like to know the .vimrc setting to turn it back on or mvim switch that I should use to open files so that they are tabbed instead of opened as new windows./h2  The .vimrc I am using currently is:  precodeset number set ruler "folding settings set foldmethod=indent   "fold based on indent set foldnestmax=20      "deepest fold is 10 levels set nofoldenable        "dont fold by default set foldlevel=31        "this is just what i use set ignorecase /code/pre  I don't think any of the above should change the behaviour of mvim and the way it opens new files.  I've already read: MacVim -- switch to tab where file is opened if trying to open an already-opened file; and Use MacVim as standard Terminal?; and I am also in the middle of reading :help mvim  I am sure I have read the answer somewhere, however I cannot remember where and now cannot find it.  <answer105666> h2use the code--remote-tab/code command line switch, as in:/h2  precodemvim --remote-tab foobar.txt /code/pre  The answer was obtained by reading codehelp:mvim/code it is located in section 14 of the help file titled strongmacvim-hints/strong.  Extracted here is the relevant section of the MacVim 7.4 help file:     Scenario:       ~ You want to open a file in a tab in an already opened    window, but typing "mvim filename" in Terminal opens it up in a    separate window.       Solution:       ~ Use the |--remote-tab| switch.  If you    have several windows open you might have to specify which window you    want the file to open in by using the |--servername| switch.  The    title of a window usually ends in something like "VIM" or "VIM3" ---    this is the server name of that window.  So to open a file named    "foobar.txt" in a window whose title ends in "VIM3" you would type    (the order of the arguments matters):          codemvim --servername VIM3 --remote-tab foobar.txt/code       For more information, consult the |client-server| manual page.
