How to make an NTFS Shared Volume Writable <body> I am on a Macbook Pro with OS X Yosemite. I have another Mac Mini running Windows 8 that I have connected to via a Router.   I am essentially trying to share files from an NTFS volume, but I need to make it writable. I open a Finder window and then do strongGo â†’ Connect to Server/strong and then enter the name of my Mac Mini Shared Folder.  Everything works great, but it's only read only. I've tried editing /etc/fstab using the following TutsPlus Tutorial, but that didn't work.  I'm looking into using 'mount_ntfs' on the command line but I just can't get my head around it just yet.  I'd appreciate a little assistance.  <answer165231> NTFS is a strongdisk file system/strong. Usually you may access NTFS only by directly attached devices (e.g. PATA, SATA, SCSI etc.)  If you connect to a share over the network you use a strongdistributed file system/strong or strongnetwork file system/strong. They do not share block level access to the same storage but use a network protocol (e.g. AFP, SMB, NFS etc.).  Since the NTFS volume is attached to the MacMini, you won't be able to mount it via fstab or mount_ntfs on your MacBook Pro.  Instead check the permissions / ACLs in the file sharing settings in Windows 8.  <comment193837> Thanks. I managed to get it to work, but I really don't know what I did, but I suspect it's when I turned On 'File and Printer Sharing' (across Private, Public and Guest, etc.) under 'Advanced Sharing' in Network Sharing Center in Windows 8.
