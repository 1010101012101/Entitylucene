(Kali Linux) FATAL: Module wl not found in directory /lib/modules/4.9.0-kali3-amd64 <body> I ran a bunch of stuff trying to get my Wi-Fi to work, which included updating my codesources.list/code file and running codeapt-get update/code many times, but the Wi-Fi just won't work. I think I understand the driver codewl/code is important, but whenever I do codemodprobe wl/code, it gives this error:   precodeFATAL: Module wl not found in directory /lib/modules/4.9.0-kali3-amd64 /code/pre  I have Kali Linux 2017.1, the latest version at the time of this post. I am dual booting on a MacBook Air 13 inch, early-2015 version.  <comment374380> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's not really about Apple hardware or software & would be better on a unix site. <comment374383> @Tetsujin, The OP states "I am dual booting on a MacBook Air 13 inch, early-2015 version.", so how is this off topic? SinByCos, is using Apple hardware, or does this not qualify because it's not a question about macOS or Windows installed via Boot Camp? <comment374385> @user3439894 - It's not a question about Apple anything, it's an issue with an unsupported OS which merely coincidentally sits on Apple hardware. If you don't agree with my vote, don't vote along with it; that's kind of how it works here. <comment374467> What @Tetsujin said.
