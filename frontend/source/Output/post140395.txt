Can connect over SSH from Mac to linux <body> I have an Xubuntu server set up with SSH. I can connect to it using Putty on Windows and via a Chrome SSH plugin on my Mac. However, when I use terminal client it just hangs for a bit and then I get a connection reset. The debug output is:  precodessh xxxxx@xx.xx.xx.xx:2222 -v  OpenSSH_6.2p2, OSSLShim 0.9.8r 8 Dec 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 102: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to xx.xx.xx.xxx:2222 [xx.xx.xx.xx] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/xxxxx/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/xxxxx/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/xxxxx/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/xxxxx/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.2 /code/pre  Does anyone have any advice?  <answer140398> I noticed in the debug output that there is mention of port '22' even though I specified '2222'. It like you need to put a '-p' flag in when using terminal:     ssh -p 2222 myname@xx.xx.xx.xx   This seems a bit weird as with other terminals I was using:     ssh myname@xx.xx.xx.xx:2222   <comment165498> Could you run this again with "-vvv" at the end please?
