How can I remove one of the partition and expand the other to max capacity? <body> I am aware of this solution (Can I remove one partition on an external drive, while keeping the other intact?), but since it is asked 2 years ago, I want to ask again to see if there is any new approach to this kind of problem.  Here is the screen of the Disk Utility.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o681l.png" alt="enter image description here"  In my portable drive, I have two partition. I would like to remove the blue one ('ExtraAppleID') and then expand the red to take up all the remaining space.  However I cannot find any way to remove the blue partition.  The MBP is running 10.12.1 (macOS Sierra).   <comment337390> Let's put a bounty on the old question if it needs updated answers.
