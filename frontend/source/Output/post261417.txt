Replacing hard drive with SSD mid-2009 <body> I currently have two A1311 21.5" iMac's (mid-2009) that I would like to upgrade to SSD drives (while I'm at it, they're also getting new screen glass). Contrary to several pieces of advice I have received, I do emnot/em want to use a hybrid drive... I want no moving parts related to memory in my Mac.  So, what I would like to do, would be something like a Western Digital 1TB SSD and I want to do a complete replacement - I don't want the original 500GB Western Digital HDD to stay in (I want to use those old drives for testing on my other Macs).  So here's the question(s): what equipment do I need to do this upgrade? The other question is (within the first), what should I look for in an SSD before purchasing it (recommendations would be appreciated but not expected).  strongNote:/strong there was an answer to this question on iFixit; however, I didn't think I trusted some of the information in that answer.
