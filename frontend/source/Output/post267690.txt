How to remove automatically subscribed calendar for public holidays on my iPhone? <body> As you can see in the screenshot below, somehow my iPhone subscribed to a calendar which is called "Deutsche Feiertage" (German public holidays).  How can I find out where this is coming from and how can I remove it (not just hide or disable notification)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3vr2.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am not hundert percent sure, but I think it is there since I upgraded my Mac to macOS 10.12. It was also there in the calendar app. There it was really easy to delete it. But I cannot find I way to get rid of it on my iPhone (using iPhone 6 Plus with iOS 10.2).  <answer267700> You can't delete the iOS holidays calendar, only hide it. It is a subscribed calendar but it's part of iOS.  <answer268408> Open your calendar, at the bottom center of your screen select "Calendars":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wueA8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Go down to "Holidays in the US" and deselect the check mark on the left side of your screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciJNh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You're done!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/94scB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment336975> Yes this is how to hide a calendar.
