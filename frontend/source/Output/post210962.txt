The website "secure-web.cicsco.com" requires a client certificate <body> My dad got the message in the subject line in Safari today, with a list of certificates and "cancel" and "continue" buttons. He chose "continue".  I gather from a discussion at Apple's site that it's possible to undo this choice by using Keychain Access to find and remove any unwanted items.  No problem if it were me, but I'm not sure I can walk him through the steps over the phone-- especially as he's not 100% certain which site(s) produced this message. So I'm wondering, what actually happens if we leave things as they are? What possible negative effects should I be concerned about?
