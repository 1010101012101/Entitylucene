No photos in My Photo Stream Folder on my PC? <body> I have tried everything and not matter what I do, none of my photos on my iPhone sync with my "MY PHOTO STREAM" folder on my PC. If I want to transfer my photos from my phone to my computer I have to connect my phone to my pc and transfer that way. It stopped syncing many months ago :0(  <comment174904> Did you check the iCloud Control Panel, make sure it's set to sync, in Photos/Options? If it is, try disabling it, sign out, sign in, re-enable.
