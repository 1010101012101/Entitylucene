Disable ⌘+p and ⌘+s in Terminal.app <body> I continually hit kbd⌘-P/kbd and kbd⌘-S/kbd while Terminal is in focus, due to alt-tabbing between my text editor and other programs.  Does anyone know how to disable these keys in Terminal.app?  <answer69736> You could try out Keymando which will let you set specific shortcuts for programs. In this case, you would set those commands to do nothing.  Another solution would be to use iTerm 2, which allows you to specify shortcuts for keys (or to ignore).  <answer69743> h1Removing a Default Keyboard Shortcut in OS X/h1  h2TL;DR Version/h2  Run the following two commands in Terminal, then restart it.  precodedefaults write com.apple.terminal NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Export Text As..." nil defaults write com.apple.terminal NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Print..." nil /code/pre  h1Full Explanation/h1  You can use the defaults command to disable a built-in keyboard shortcut for an app (for a custom shortcut, just remove it from Keyboard Preferences).  To disable it, you need to know the emexact/em name of the menu item the shortcut is associated with and the bundle identifier of the app.  To get an app's bundle identifier, run codeosascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'/code in Terminal, replacing codeAppName/code as appropriate.  Once you have that information, the proper command is:  precodedefaults write BUNDLE_ID NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "MENU_ITEM" nil /code/pre  Followed by a restart of the app.  h1Restoring the Shortcuts/h1  If you want to undo this, you can either remove the entries in Keyboard Preferences if they appear there (they don't always), or rewrite the codeNSUserKeyEquivalents/code dictionary.   First, check if you have any other shortcuts set, by running codedefaults read BUNDLE_ID NSUserKeyEquivalents/code.  If you only see the entries you created, then you can just run codedefaults delete BUNDLE_ID NSUserKeyEquivalents/code and restart the app.  If there are other entries (most likely custom shortcuts you set in Keyboard Preferences), then you need to modify the entry, read below.  h2Selectively Restoring Default Shortcuts/h2  Run codedefaults read BUNDLE_ID NSUserKeyEquivalents/code. You'll get some output like this:  precode{     "Other Shortcut" = "@\\U2190";     "Export Text As..." = nil;     "Print..." = nil; } /code/pre  Remove the lines you want to reset (codeExport/code and codePrint/code), then copy the remaining output as-is; make sure to include the curly brackets. Then type (but don't yet run) codedefaults write BUNDLE_ID NSUserKeyEquivalents '/code. Paste your modified text after that (be sure you included the single quote before pasting), then close the single quote (code'/code) and run the command. Once you restart the app, the default shortcuts should be restored, while keeping any existing ones.  <comment81016> Definitely recommend iTerm 2. Great app, and constantly has updates too! <comment116029> For iTerm2 to "disable" Print: Prefs  Profiles  Default  Keys  Add shortcut key ⌘-P  Ignore. <comment286346> on iterm2 if i ignore CMD+P it will allow me to map CMD+P on vim? <comment302527> @ArnoldRoa was hoping for the same, no luck here though. You?
