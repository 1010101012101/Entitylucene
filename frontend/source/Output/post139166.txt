You can get rid of it using http://www.macbartender.com app.  <answer139169> You can disable it only with some tools, Bartender is not free, but a nice tool.  I think you will love NCBackgrounder - after the Installation you can disable Notification Center (or Customize it) and the best thing is - it's completely free.  I hope this works for you.  <answer139171> It is the Notification Center icon.

I also found a command line approach http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/06/disable-notification-center-remove-menu-bar-icon-os-x/ <comment164159> I'm fairly certain this does not address the question being asked. Want to add some more detail so it doesn't get down voted? <comment164161> That does more than remove the icon. It unloads Notification Center completely, which is not exactly the question you asked. Just wanted to clarify for future visitors. <comment164162> @samh You're referring to `MonoThreaded` comment to be exact :) Accepted answer also removes NC completly not only the icon.
