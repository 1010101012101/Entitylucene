Remote (Dell) printer errors <body> When I configure and print to remote Dell printers, I get an odd errors in my codesystem.log/code:  precodesandboxd[xxx] ([xxxxx]): DellSecureFilter(xxxxx) deny file-write-create /private/tmp/fx20140919212407.job /code/pre  This occurs each time I attempt to print.  It works just fine for local network printers; only fails for printers that are connected by a vpn and on a different subnet.  These same printers work fine on Windows machines, so there is something going on with security somewhere that I'm not seeing.  <comment172139> "...only fails for printers that are connected by a vpn and on a different subnet..." I would bet that the vpn is the problem. <comment172143> Apple product and OSX please. <comment172171> Well, I do not believe this is a VPN problem.  I think the crux is that sandboxd is not allowing the creating and writing of files for this process to the tmp folder.  I think the question is ultimately, how can I change the permissions of a process in sandboxd to see if this resolves the problem and if ultimately Dell has a bug in the way they've written their daemon for OS X.
