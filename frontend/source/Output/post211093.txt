How to mount Core Storage volume under Linux (or force conversion on unrevertible volume)? <body> I tried to mount HFS+ partition in Linux today, but I had problem with  precodehfsplus: unable to find HFS+ superblock /code/pre  I've found later that this partition is in fact Core Storage container for the logical volume, what could mean I should at least know corrected offset of the real logical volume on this partition.  I tried to follow advices seen in plenty of places to revert the volume using codediskutil cs revert UUID/code, however my problem is that I see:  precodeLogical Volume C4FE8... ----------------------------------------------------- [...] Revertible:      No [...] /code/pre  Logical Volume Family above this has all encryption related fields set to emNo/em/emNone/em. However I cannot find a way how to have this volume revertible.  Because it's only 300 GB of data on 1TB drive, I've managed to shrink it. The idea I have is to create empty partition of the same size as the volume and the copy it using codedd/code. Then I would have pure HFS+ partition probably mountable under Linux. However codegpt/code in recovery doesn't allow me to add next partition to disk0 saying "resource is busy". Graphical utility seem to have some bug and I cannot confirm new partition (in recovery mode as I don't know the password to superuser account).  Now, does anyone manage to mount Core Storage volume at least read-only under Linux? Or maybe someone found the way how to make this Core Storage volume revertible?  <answer242324> I don't know if it's possible to remove CoreStorage entirely once a disk's been converted, but it is possible to mount the HFS volumes inside (provided they are not encrypted - if so, you'll also need to use libfvde).  <comment372484> How far did you get ? I'm stuck on a message saying `libfvde_io_handle_read_volume_header: unsupported core storage signature ` Using the fvdemount from an Ubuntu Iso I would also be happy with just read-only, maybe we can help each other ?
