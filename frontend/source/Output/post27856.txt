How can I take a larger screenshot on my iPhone? <body> I would like to take a screenshot of an entire web page in Mobile Safari, not just the part that's visible on the screen. I'm running iOS 5 on an iPhone 4, but I'm pretty sure this functionality isn't built in anywhere. What app or trick do I need?  <answer27864> It's not ideal obviously, but if you need a shot of the page exactly as it appears on the phone, your best bet is to scroll around the page, taking a series of screen shots and manually stitch them together on a PC.  Printing to a PC as a PDF is an alright idea, as is setting your desktop Safari to send the iPhone user-agent, but neither will give you perfect renderings of what it looks like on the iPhone, often there will be substantial formatting differences.  <answer32208> This question has been asked on StackOverflow.  Webpage Capture ($2.39, demo, confirmed on SO) or Website Screenshot ($0.99) should do the trick.  emI have not tested any of them./em  hr  As a side note: since Safari for Mac itself doesn't do full page export*, it really doesn't come as a surprise there's no way to do so on iOS.  *yes, of course you can print as PDF, but that's completely different from saving a full-dimensioned, not-paginated, not-styled-for-print version of the website (for which a third-party app such as LittleSnapper is necessary)  <answer32234> Webshot Free can do this (there's a 99¢ ad-free version too). It's supposed to let you just change http:// to webshot:// and it will open the same URL in in the app. That didn't work, but cut+paste did.  There may be other apps which are better for certain needs, depending on what you want to actually do with the page. If you just want a JPG or PNG of it, Webshot Free works fine.  If you are trying to save a page for reading later, iCab Mobile ($2, universal) will let you save a .webarchive or a .pdf file. [Note: the print to pdf function is actually provided by 3rd party webapps, but it's integrated into iCab].  There are a variety of "Print to PDF" apps in the app store, PrintBureau, seems to be one of the better ones (and is universal).  <answer32249> ol liLaunch Mobile Safari on devices running iOS5. /li liType the URL of the website of interest./li liAfter the web page is done loading, touch the gray Reader "button" to the right of the URL address.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxSJJ.png" alt="Mobile Safari web browser"/li liMobile Safari is now in "Reader" mode (note the purple text color), select the img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8j8oy.png" alt="enter image description here" icon and choose "Mail this Article".

You can then save it, email it or share it   on Social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Flickr. Saving as PDF   enables you to archive your files and access them for off-line reading   and for record-keeping.      This version also enables you to export pdf files to iBooks,   Evernote...and any other app you have for reading pdf files.      The app captures the complete webpage whether visible or not as an   image instead of HTML. This is useful for keeping track of pages   visited, keeping a log of dynamic pages, for storing information (eBay   auctions, digital magazine, digital newspapers...) or for later   reading or for sharing with somebody somewhere that cannot access a   webpage.       The screenshot can be saved on the device itself and can also be   transferred via iTunes File Share.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iSqRU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment31921> Are you open to a solution that uses the print functionality (with or without reader)? I'm fairly certain unmodified iOS can't by itself print to a PDF (but let's see if anyone can answer in the next few days) If I needed this today, [Printopia by Ecamm](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/printopia/) lets your mac receive any iOS print and convert it to various file formats. <comment31923> Not providing this as an answer, as you specifically say you want to use the iphone, but changing your user agent on normal safari then printing as pdf would do the trick. <comment36981> Huh? Just tried on my iPhone, the mailed article is the Reader view, not at all the original website. Plus, it only works if the website is compatible with the Reader mode! <comment36982> Matti, agree with your comment that "…only works if the website is compatible with the Reader mode!" which is why I clearly stated on 5 that "some websites may not render properly…". This is the closest (without jail breaking) that I know of to capture the entire webpage (though not as it originally looks). <comment37066> I changed your title. I hope that's what you meant. Let me know if it isn't. <comment37156> Ah, but I think the OP is interested in capturing the _look_ of the page rather than its contents, don't you agree? At least, that's what the term “screenshot” means to me :-S <comment37300> Webshot! Webshot webshot webshot webshot.
