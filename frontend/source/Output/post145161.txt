Suddenly SSD become unreadable, need to initialise it <body> I use my SSD with Mac OS on it on several mac (mine is with apple right now). It works well with one mac mini but fails with the macbook air, is shows the following message : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KOT6E.png" alt="enter image description here"  (sorry for french...) So it ask for an initialization which I don't want to do (I'm not the kind of guy whom like to re-install a full backup on a sunny Saturday afternoon) so I tried this command line in terminal :  precodesudo gpt recover /dev/disk1 /code/pre  Which gave me this annoying error :   precodegpt recover: /dev/disk1: no primary or secondary GPT headers, can't recover  /code/pre  I'm kind of lost, any help would be great !  <comment171089> Sounds like the plugging and unplugging did something to it. The MBA is rather sensitive, so check your cable connection in there. <comment171096> @Buscarì›ƒ well, the MBA recognize another disk with the same connector (every time) and mine doesn't work every time (like 20 tries) furthermore, disk utility can see the size of the ssd... I don't know what to do.
