Old password not being accepted when attempting to change password <body> I was trying to change my password from System Preferences on my MacBook Pro. I followed the procedure by filling in the old password along with the new one. However, I am informed that the old password is incorrect! I tried several times but it didn't succeed. The old password is not working so the newer one is not being set.  <answer197295> You can reboot into recovery and run coderesetpassword/code from Terminal to reset your password.  <comment235852> Welcome to Ask Different! Please add your OS version, and add details as where exactly are you trying to change your password on System Preferences. Thanks! <comment235860> did you set it up so that you can use the Apple ID to recover ? <comment235861> is cap lock on? did you change the keyboard layout ?
