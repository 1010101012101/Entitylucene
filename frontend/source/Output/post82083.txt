why does my Apple TV (1st gen) not show up in iTunes <body> I cannot connect my ATV to iTunes (10.7.(21)). No ATV is shown in the device list, nor is there an Apple tab in the iTunes preferences. ATV gives me a 5-digit number to enter in iTunes - but where???  Went through all the troubleshooting steps recommended by Apple - to no success. ATV won't show up in IT - wirelessly or ethernet-connected  PS: strangely enough the ATV showed up in the remote speakers list in IT...
