Why are only some songs on my iTunes account transferring to my iPhone? <body> When I first added songs to my phone, all of them were there. Then today I noticed some songs were on the iTunes library but not on my iPhone. On iTunes I have 311 songs but on my phone there are only 140.  Also, I did make sure that the playlists, artists, etc. were checked that I wanted, but still some music is not synced.   <comment71424> Did you uncheck some of the songs? You might be syncing only playlists, or certain artists.
