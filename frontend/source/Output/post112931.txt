Weird local domain behaviour <body> I just clean installed mavericks on my mac and local domains i use for web development still work. Surely clean install wipes the host file, so how is this possible? Its not really a problem, i am just wondering how its possible!  Current hosts file  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost  fe80::1%lo0 localhost /code/pre  <comment132563> Were your local domains previously listed in the host file? <comment132566> yeah, like 127.0.0.1 jf.co.uk <comment133322> Now a few days have passed, do the domains still resolve locally? <comment133816> Yeah they do, i've come back from uni as well so its not my router <comment133821> It is unlikely to answer the question but you may want to reset the DNS cache: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5343
