Early 2011 15" Macbook Pro running Windows 7, front USB port misbehaves <body> I have an early 2011 15" MacBook Pro on which I primarily use Bootcamp &amp; Windows 7.  The front USB port works well using OSX but under Windows, it thinks any storage device lugged into it is an iPhone.  When the "iPhone" is ejected, it says "it is safe to remove the device" but the machine hangs once the device is unplugged--no response from touchpad or keyboard.  The only option is a hard-shutdown (press &amp; hold Power button) followed by warnings about improper shutdown upon reboot.  This issue effectively makes my MacBook a single-USB port machine.  Can I triage this or is a hardware repair in order?
