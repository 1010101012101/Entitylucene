ExFAT formatted SD card not recognizing space <body> I'm trying to Homebrew my Nintendo Wii, and a 2 GB or under SD card is required. However, the Wii will also recognize 4 GB cards if enough junk is put on it. I'm attempting to do this with my Optima 4GB SD Card (goo.gl/qqJn8p) on Mac OS X, El Capitan (v. 10.11.6). After formatting it to ExFAT, I put a 1.28 GB file on the card. Everything went smoothly. The next time I tried, though, I got an error saying that there wasn't enough space, even though there's plenty left. Here's a screenshot of the SD card info.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/mqUruCi.png"   I know that this is a common problem with USB's, but is there any solution for SD cards?  *As a sidenote, I formatted with Disk Utility.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/5rmaN9X.png"   (ex-post from Stack Overflow)  <comment360464> What's the partition scheme? If it's GUID, try changing it to MBR. <comment360466> The fact that the total capacity shows as being less than the remaining space rings alarm bells. I'd try 2 things; first format it with the official formatter from the SDorg -https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html - then test with Fight Flash Fraud app [F3X](https://github.com/insidegui/F3X) to make sure it's the size it claims to be. <comment360493> I've done this before. The Wii doesn't need exFAT. I just used FAT32 or (FAT) with a MBR. Try copying the files again, and it should be fine. <comment360563> Just formatted to FAT32 with SDFormatter and checked the card's status with F3X and everything seems to be okay. There's no longer the negative gigabytes in Disk Utility. I noticed that although there are nearly 3 GBs worth of files in the card, it says that there are 2.71 GBs left. After trying to put an 80mb file in it, I got the same error message saying that there wasn't enough space. Image for reference: http://i.imgur.com/prA4ePc.png
