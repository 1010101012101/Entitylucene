iTunes asking for password for wrong iTunes account <body> I purchased a new phone at Sam's club and they transferred the data from my old iPhone to my new iPhone. But now more and more apps will not update with out the password for an iTunes account that I don't know who's is. Even apps that I have downloaded since that data transfer have this problem. I have tried rebooting my iPhone, logging in and out of iTunes, and deleting and reinstalling the app but nothing works.   <answer184614> Try signing out of iTunes on your iPhone and signing in as your Apple ID. After you login as the right account, delete all the apps you have downloaded and redownload them.   <comment218655> What error do they give? <comment218658> If they set it up you should go ask why they used a new applied and what the password is.  Also ask why they didn't use your existing appleid <comment218670> The problem is that I live 2 hrs from the location I purchased the phone <comment218688> You will have to go back, since they screwed up. You could call them to get the log in information, but I doubt they will give it to you. <comment219966> The OP may lose information not backed up when deleting the apps though.
