My Mac is making an odd noise every couple of minutes <body> Total Mac OS noob here, after spending a lifetime on Windows I have my first Mac.  Every couple minutes I hear an odd sound (playing through the speakers), it sounds like two beeps in quick succession, with a puddle-like noise in the background.  It doesn't seem to be anything listed under Sound Effects in the control panel.  What does this sound mean, and do I have to do anything?  <answer192922> This sounds like the sound Skype makes for a Contact Available notification.  <answer263292> Temporary solution  Go to Skype- Preferences - notifications- Event: Contact becomes available and untick "play sound"  I'm almost 100% sure that I don't have  any pending request yet this sound plays randomly in every minute. I removed the tick from the menu and it's fine now.  <comment189399> What happens if you adjust the volume? Does the volume of the sound change too? <comment189400> @AlistairMcMillan Yes it does <comment189401> Could you record the sound for us? For example using the voice memo app on your phone. <comment189402> I'll try my best <comment189403> Found it by cycling through the sounds on various apps, it was the *Contact Available* sound on Skype, never heard that on Windows, cheers <comment229121> @JMK Then answer your own question, its allowed, and you even get a badge from it!
