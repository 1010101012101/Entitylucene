IOS 6.4 on an iphone 5 and the email ceased to work <body> "It can not be updated." That is the only reason it is still running IOS 6.4 and not the newest. Inherently you would expect problems, and the answer would be; update it.br But this iPhone 5 apparently can not be updated. Basically, how do you fix an iPhone 5 that cannot be updated, cannot be restored to be updated, cannot be connected to itunes; etc.   Editbr Open the email app, it crashes constantly even after restarting. Really the problem is it needs to be updated. Just looking for any stray information that might help.br Thanks!  <comment247672> We need mor information. What prevents updating? What error(s) are you getting with email? Give exact quotes if possible. <comment247675> Check the edit in a minuet <comment247682> Why can't you update it? Have you tried from iTunes?
