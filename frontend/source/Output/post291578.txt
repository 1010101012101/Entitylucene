How to fix stuck/'disabled' zooming on trackpad? <body> I recently bought myself a new Trackpad, since my old Magic Trackpad broke. Ever since, however, zooming (two finger pinch) gets stuck/disabled/not working somehow and, besides rebooting, the only simple solution is go to codepreferences â†’ Trackpad/code and disable &amp; enable PinchToZoom`.  It's very annoying, but also strange that his occurs suddenly. This shouldn't be happening. I can't find anything on the web regarding for a permanent fix.  Does anyone else do?  <answer295176> Since you've already played with your System Preferences, I'd suggest testing to see if this happens while booted into Safe Mode, and also strongwithout any external devices connected/strong, including both USB and Bluetooth.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your Macbook into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Macbook/li liRestart your Macbook/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. does zoom work on the built-in trackpad when using Safari, Photoshop, etc)/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your Macbook as normal/li liAgain, test to see what happens with zoom etc./li /ol  Now, if after you've gone through the above steps you find that:  ul lizooming works during Safe Mode but not when you're logged back in normally, let me know./li lizoom still isn't working during Safe Mode, then it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics (see below)./li /ul  NOTE: The steps below are for Mac models introduced from June 2013 onwards. If your Mac was introduced before June 2013, it uses Apple Hardware Test instead.  strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong  Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  <comment370299> Just chiming in to say I have the exact same issue! This started around when I got the new OS X update, around the same time you posted this question. <comment370316> Sadly haven't found a solution for this.. <comment371896> What macOS are you running? Which version of Magic Trackpad and computer? And you can't think of anything that prompts it? <comment371917> Hi @DonielF - I'm running 10.12.5. I've an update that I'll be installing right now (10.12.6) which I postponed for a long time. Though, I doubt it'll change anything. I really got no clue what causes this. It mostly happens/notices the error in either Safari, Photoshop or Sketch, as these apps are the ones I zoom in.. It seems completely random. However, it started since I bought the Magic Trackpad 2. Strangely enough, the problem also appears to happen when Bluetooth is off and I'm working on my Macbook alone, away from the Magic Trackpad 2. <comment371989> Hm. And you never took it over to Apple to have them take a look at it? <comment371991> No, I have not. Besides that Apple is more than an hour drive, I'm pretty sure it's a software issue. I could try a second user account, but I use many apps installed on my main user account. Oh well, perhaps I can try for a day, since it easily happens multiple times a day. Wish it was September already, so the official of High Sierra is released and I can do a clean install. <comment372024> @SanderSchaeffer you might as well try a macOS reinstall, it may be some sort of unresolved update error. You won't lose any personal information or anything and will go right back to where you were. You can reinstall whatever macOS version you have using the Purchased section of the App Store <comment372583> Thank you for your elaborate help in writing such long suggestion. Your tip helps finding out whether the problem is a software or hardware one. However, I think @Jackson1442, with his comment, did the trick actually. I did a quick reinstall without losing data last Wednesday and, although I haven't used my Macbook in the weekend, I haven't had any problem ever since. Not 100% sure I've got rid of the problem, but we'll see. The only 'problem' with your safe mode though, Is that the problem occurred once a day, not after login or within 5 minutes.. Yet, big thanks mate :) <comment372588> That's great! :) And I agree - if the problem was only intermittent and very occasional, troubleshooting steps like booting into Safe Mode can be a PITA, but sometimes troubleshooting just requires, well, a lot of patience! Hopefully the macOS reinstallation fixed it for good! :) <comment372931> Ok, that's a bummer. Every multi-touch gesture works, except for zooming. So the reinstall didn't fix the problem. However, as other gestures work, can I verify that the problem isn't the hardware?
