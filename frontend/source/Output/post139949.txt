How can I find my lost iPhone 5c? <body> I lost my iPhone 5c in Gypsom, Colorado and am pretty sure it has 50% or more of battery remaining.   How can i locate it?  <answer139960> If you have Find My iPhone enabled on the device, go to icloud.com and see if the device is online. If it is, you can locate it on a map and put it in lost mode to track the location as well as send a message to it.  <comment164915> Start by calling your number. If a honest person found it they will answer.
