Chrome Kiosk Mode on Yosemite Reveals Topbar <body> I'm trying to use an iMac as a kiosk interface for some local web content. Up til now, I would just use Google Chrome in kiosk mode (from a shell script that opens Chrome with the --kiosk flag). This used to work great, making it impossible to navigate out of Chrome without a keyboard.  Now I need it to work on a machine running Yosemite. On this machine, launching Chrome with the kiosk flag still allows the user to reveal the topbar if they move the cursor to the top of the screen. Is there any way to prevent this behavior?
