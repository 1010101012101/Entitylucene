How do delete menulets added via "Onyx" <body> I added some menus via strongOnyx/strong and now I don't know how to get rid of them again. Holding option and clicking on the menus doesn't provide an option to close them and I cannot delete the "iChat.menu" in strongem/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/iChat.menu/em/strong because I get an error message telling me that it can't be deleted because it's needed by OSX.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z49oO.png" alt="My menubar"  Thanks for the help :)  <answer226082> Generally speaking you can remove Mac OS menus like that by kbdCommand/kbd dragging the menu off the menu bar (EG hold the kbdCommand/kbd key, click the menu and drag it down)  Tetsujin's suggestion also holds merit as the settings applied in Onyx can be strongun/strongapplied in Onyx by clearing the check box and then applying the change.  <comment274412> Presumably Onyx can remove them also.
