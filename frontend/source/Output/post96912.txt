Windows desktop not showing properly under Parallels Desktop <body> I'm stuck and not finding any real solutions...  I have MacBook Pro (2011) running Mac 10.7.5.  Research led me to look into using Parallels Desktop to have Windows on same machine.  So I did and then installed Parallels 8 for Mac, then installed Windows 7 on the virtual machine.  Originally, this Windows 7 instance has it's own "desktop" via C:\Users\Me\Desktop and has a bunch of folders and other links on it.  Somehow, somewhere along the way, these folders are not visible on the windows desktop, but instead some other Mac-based shared folder of a desktop through parallels.  I've tried swapping in/out of "coherence" mode, but still can't seem to get the original folders back and running.  Any ideas, suggestions?  Thanks
