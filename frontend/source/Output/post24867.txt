How can I export an MS Outlook .pst file to Apple Mail? <body> I want to export an MS Outlook .pst file to Apple Mail. How can I do this?  <answer24869> Do it via an IMAP server, which you can install on the Mac. I used codedovecot/code, created an account on it, added that account to Outlook and just moved it all over. Then in Mail, I created the same account, and copied everything over.  I prefer this method because it completely preserves all the properties of each message, including attachments. Exporting and importing through another method (including Thunderbird) doesn't preserve everything properly.  <answer24883> You can use Outlook2Mail. It can export mails, contacts and calendar entries.  But there are a few caveats:  ul li12,95USD/li liOnly U.S./English versions of Windows and Outlook are supported at this time. Little Machines does not guarantee the successful conversion of non-English characters, languages other than English and date formats outside of the United States./li liYou need a computer which is still running Outlook to export. You can't just copy the PST to your Mac and convert it./li /ul  <comment27959> thank for answer but now i use pop3 to get email <comment27972> Irrelevant. You're setting up a mail server on your own computer for the purpose of transferring mail between Outlook and Mail.app. This has no bearing on your current email account. <comment28103> -1 - Limited and not free, just go the IMAP route. <comment28104> +1 - This is reasonably simple to do and complete. It doesn't hurt that it's free too. <comment28113> slomojo, you are wrong to vote this down simply because it requires a commercial utility. People who develop commercial utilities need to make a living.
