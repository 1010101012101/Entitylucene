Change resolution for single Space/Desktop <body> I'm guessing this is likely not possible, but I have a setup on my rMBP 15" where I want most of my windows to be at 1920x1200. On one program, which has its own desktop, I'd like to scale that down some. Is it possible to assign a custom resolution to a single Space that doesn't affect other Spaces?  <comment353048> What do you mean by _On one program, which has its own desktop_? Is this some sort of virtual machine? Can you provide details of the program in question? <comment353092> I think the app might have one window and mbm29414 is using it full screen, as per https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25072. <comment353155> @Monomeeth I have Xcode open on a Desktop/Space where it is the only window. So, I guess I'm asking for a way to change the resolution of a single Desktop/Space. I know I can monkey with fonts and font sizes, but that's my second choice. <comment353185> AFAIK that's not possible.
