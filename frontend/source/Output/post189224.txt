Can Find My iPhone still locate a device if it is restored with DFU mode? <body> How does this work? You can restore phones in DFU mode but you're faced with Activation Lock if you have enabled it. Will you still be able to locate it?  <answer189267> You can't locate the device with an active Activation Lock.  Any restored device can't be located with Find My iPhone:  ul liIf I remote wipe my iPhone, can I still locate it remotely?/li /ul  <comment224408> I thought the question was meant if someone else tries to reset the phone e.g. through DFU mode, can you still locate it? <comment224409> @Gabkano Yes, that's what this answer answers. DFU restore activates Activation Lock, as mentioned in the question, therefore the device can't be tracked any more. <comment224430> and that's also possible in lost mode?
