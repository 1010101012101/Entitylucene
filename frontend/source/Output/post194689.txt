Pages: Change Body Style for Entire document <body> I'm using Pages 5.5.3 on OS X 10.10.4. I can't figure out how to change the size of the Body style for the entire document. If I try to increase the size of the Body text it only changes the size of the text where my cursor was last - the rest of the document is unaffected.  Thank you in advance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/okzba.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer194697> When you click on the font size selector, an kbdUpdate/kbd button appears beside the style you have selected:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Suxu5.png" alt="Pages - update style throughout the document"  Click on it and the style is updated to the new parameters. Existing and new text with this paragraph style will adopt them.  <comment232332> Did you try selecting all text using "âŒ˜ A"?
