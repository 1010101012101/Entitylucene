MySQL does not start on startup <body> In the System Preferences panel, I have the MySQL there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dOgxd.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O6SRo.png" alt="enter image description here"  I chose it to start up every time my Mac starts up, however this doesn't work, I have restarted MySQL many times, but it will not start up at all - which I require to start up emmanually/em.  How can I fix this?  <answer30388> There should also be logs in /usr/local/mysql/data. You'll have to "sudo su" from a Terminal session in order to see that directory. Check for any errors being reported in a filed named like this: "Your-computer-name.local.err"  Report back whatever you see that doesn't make sense.  You can also check out the startup script to make sure there are no errors. Find that here: /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MYSQLCOM  <answer31608> Starting MySQL server automatically actually means executing the code/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld/code d√¶mon on startup. If MySQL won't do it for you, it's easy enough to add the necessary instructions yourself.  For this, we'll add a launchd job descriptor to the code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code folder. The procedure is very well described in this Mac OS X Hints article.  hr  emNote: I would have liked to copy and edit it here, since it adds some details that are unnecessary in this case, but I couldn't find license information about Mac OS X Hints' content, so I'll simply link./em  <answer31614> Use terminal and paste this snippet:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysqld.plist /code/pre  <comment34831> Did you search for any hints in /var/log already? <comment34853> Hmm, I don't see any type of logs in the `/usr/local/mysql/data` directory. The file/directory does not exist in `/Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MYSQLCOM`. <comment36228> You don't have to be root to use sudo, being an admin user is enough. <comment36230> Ok, thanks for the input :-)
