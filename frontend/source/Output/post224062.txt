What filesystem should I use to share across Mac (Yosemite) and Linux? <body> I need to move large files (5-5Gb) from a Mac to a Linux machine.  Network transfers are too slow, so I wanted to use USB drives.  However filesystems seem to be a bit of a nightmare: HFS+ is hard to read on Linux, NTFS and Ext4 are hard to write on Mac.  Any advice on what's the best way to do that?  <answer224068> You can use exFAT but you may have to install the packages on Linux.  Probably along the lines of:   precodesudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils /code/pre  This has the benefit of read/write in Windows as well.  <answer224086> If you're only using files not bigger than 4GB and a drive smaller than 2TB, you can go with FAT32 (which also works on Windows). Otherwise I'd go with exFAT as well, but sometimes Windows gets problems writing to that as I experienced.  <comment271693> If you want to use what's natively supported out of the box, so-to-speak, in both Linux and OS X then FAT32 is it.  You'd have to write the files from OS X to the USB drive using `split` splitting them in half for example as FAT32 has a 4 GB individual file size limit and then use `cat` on Linux to joint the pieces back together.  Otherwise the path of least resistance would be to install what's necessary to read (and write)` exFAT` under Linux as OS X can work with that natively and handles files over the 4 GB FAT32 limit. <comment271772> Works perfectly - thanks. I just had to format the drive on Mac first. OS X would not recognize it when I formatted it on Linux.
