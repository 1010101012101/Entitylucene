How to enable Mac OS X server email alerts <body> I have a specific Mac mini server that does not send out email alerts, even though I have an email address configured.  I also want to note that I am not using the mail server within server.app.  I have other servers that are sending email alerts correctly and none of them have the mail server within server.app turned on.  Questions:  1) Do I have to enable Apple Push notifications and configure an Apple ID for this to work?  2) Do the email alerts go through Apple's servers after step 1 is configured above, or do they come directly from my server?  3) If they come directly from my server, can I specify a relay host to go through my ISPs SMTP gateway?  4) Is there any way to generate a test alert to test whether this is working or not?  What is happening is that the disk on this server is filling up and I am not getting any notifications.  It only happens once every couple of months, so I am never sure when it is going to happen.  <answer152198> I've come up with my own answers for this in case anyone comes across this question.  1) No, you do not have to enable Apple Push notifications.  2 &amp; 3) You can configure them to go through your ISP's SMTP gateway with the following steps (for 10.7.x and 10.8.x).  ul liGo to Server.app/li liGo Mail/li liCheck "Relay outgound mail through ISP"/li liClick edit to the right of that checkbox/li liSpecify your ISP's SMTP gateway in the "Outgoing Mail Relay" field./li liSpecify SMTP relay authentication if required. Click OK./li /ul  4) Use the command line shell to issue this command:  precodeecho hello | mail -s TESTSUBJECT youremail@yourdomain.com /code/pre  <comment145860> So what you really want is to have a message when the disk size reaches certain limit. <comment145930> That's correct.  The alerts are showing up in the server.app panel under alerts, however, they are not getting emailed, even though I have setup an email address under alerts \ gear \ configure email address.
