iMac disk write issues <body> I have a problem specifically with Photoshop Elements 12 Organiser and the ability to write to the internal drive on an iMac 5k with El Capitan.  I have full read write access to the files on the disk but when I try to write the metadata to the photos I get the error "An error occurred while reading files or writing files to disc.  The disc may be full or there may be a problem with the source media". I also have other issues accessing and erasing from SD cards.   <answer224396> What happens if you save your Photoshop file to a different directory or hard disk?  What are the file Permissions? Select your file in the Finder and go to File  Show Info  Permissions  It sounds like your file or folder permission are messed up. Also, Repair Disk Permissions (Applications → Utilities → Disk Utility):  <answer224562> I have specifically added myself as a user with read/write access. I had assumed that the 'everybody' group with read/write access would react in the same way as being named separately.  <comment272141> Can you write into said folder from other apps? <comment272368> I think it has something to do with deleting files (Photoshop elements appears to create a new file with the metadata, deletes the old file and then renames the new file).  When I try to delete files normally, Finder asks for my password to approve the deletion. <comment272369> The files are in a separate folder within Users which I have created and given myself read/write access <comment272421> Where did you make these changes? In Finder? In Photoshop Elements 12 Organiser? Usually you don't have to modify any OS X folder permissions on your hard drive. Saving files should be working out-of-the-box. <comment272429> I had set up a folder using Finder under "Users" called "Shared". I right clicked on the folder to "Get Info".  I had the custom access set as Read & Write for "system", "wheel" and "everyone".  Adding myself as an individual user to the list with Read & Write access has cured the issue.  I think the problem was that Photoshop was updating the metadata on the file by first making a duplicate file with the updated metadata, then deleting the old file and then renaming the duplicate file.  Finder was previously asking for my password to delete files. <comment272430> Photoshop doesn't seem to be able to cope with needing to have a password for deleting the original file as I had multiple copies of the original file.  I am such happier in general now being able to delete without the need for a password. <comment272431> I'm not sure why the system treats me differently when listed as an individual user rather than as part of the 'everyone' group but I can live with it. <comment272434> It's not a disk write issue. You are experiencing file and folder permission issues.  I don't know The PS Organiser’s folder structure, somehow the Application can’t write to your subfolders.  I would rather create a new Organiser Library in /Users/yourname/Pictures/Organiser and move over your existing data. Again, you don’t have to tweak your folder permissions all the time. <comment272575> I had decided to have a new folder which everyone could access to the files rather than giving the family access to my user area.  I've never been a great fan of separating files by user.
