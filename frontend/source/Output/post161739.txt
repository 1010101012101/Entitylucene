Archive not shown in Mail.app on Yosemite <body> I'm not sure what happened, but I don't see Archive mailbox in Mail.app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBPBF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Compared to iCloud.com, there is a Archive directory.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7hUnB.png" alt="enter image description here"  Wha might be wrong? How can I bring back the Archive box in Mail.app? I use Mac OS X 10.10.1.  <answer161897> I don't know exactly what happened, but the box comes and goes. I set the Archive box in the favorite toolbar so that I can bring it up when it's not showing itself.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aq05S.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/smqJD.png" alt="enter image description here"
