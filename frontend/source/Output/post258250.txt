Missing yellow background for dead keys <body> I have a regular US keyboard on my Macbook that I have set to "U.S. International - PC" in the keyboard preferences input source.  I'm living in Spain and learning Spanish so this is useful for quickly typing accented characters: ' + a = á, ~ + n = ñ, etc.  I don't get the helpful yellow box though. For Macbooks with the physical European international keyboard, pressing a dead key (' " ~) causes a yellow background to appear around the insertion point until the next character is pressed.  This is a very useful feature, particularly as I am still adapting to needing to type a space after these keys to get them as free-standing characters.  Is there some way I can enable the yellow background to get the same behaviour as Macbooks with the international keyboards?  (I am running Sierra, though the behaviour was the same with El Capitan.)
