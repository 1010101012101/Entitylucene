Bluetooth audio choppy/skips on El Capitan <body> I'm using the music receiver bluetooth TP-Link HA100 and when doing streaming from Spotify or iTunes the audio has clicks in and out and skips like a scratched CD. Simply unusable. I'm on MacBookPro late-2011 strongEl Capitan/strong 10.11.2  This is a known issue, I already tried these unofficial solutions:  http://lifehacker.com/fix-your-bluetooth-audio-in-yosemite-with-this-terminal-1670380974  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/179209/90762  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7263274?start=0&amp;tstart=0  but they don't work.  Note 1: the audio lags/skips seems to increase everytime I do something on Mac (that is, open an app, scrolling a page in Chrome, ...).  Note 2: no one of the above issues on iPhone and iPad  Note 3: while streaming from iPhone/iPad if I just enable bluetooth (not stream) on MBP the audio begins to lag!  It's a lot frustrating and I can't believe bluetooth con OSX is so much crappy and there's no bugfixes on the horizon! Someone can help me?  <answer225965> I have found yet another unofficial solution! it worked for me and i hope the same to you. i believe the macbook utilizes bluetooth in the background for handoff and FaceTime. i believe it searches occasionally for data or cues that are sent from secondary devices or stays quietly paired with a device you may already have (causing gaps in bluetooth connectivity). i signed out of FaceTime (disabling it) and disabled handoff. i have an iphone, and it seemed to create some kind of bluetooth interference. try this and see if it doesnt help or solve the issue    <answer242206> Just spoke with Apple Support, they gave me a cure for  Choppy Bluetooth Audio interference.  I have a Bowers and Wilkins T7 and this worked for me.  So power down your iMac  Unplug all your connected items from the back of your iMac. Then unplug power cord from back of your iMac and wait 20 seconds. Plug in all your items back your iMac usb,s etc and then the power plug.  Then hold down the P &amp; R &amp; Alt &amp; Cmd buttons ( Little finger on the P, forefinger on the R and thumb on both the Alt/Cmd buttons).  Then press the power on keep holding down all the buttons till you hear the startup sound 3 times, then release the buttons. Wait till everything powers back up and hopefully that is your problem solved. I hope this helps  <answer248275> Sorry but my solution was to sell the TP-Link HA100 and buy an Airport Express. No problems anymore.  <answer254736> This happens to me on Sierra as well. Sometimes it looks like it happens on it's own, and it always happen after I get a phone call. The audio becomes choppy, my magic mouse is choppy as well, etc.  However, turning off bluetooth on my iPhone seems to be an immediate workaround fix.  <answer256305> Restarting just worked for me, on Sierra. I don't even have an iPhone (have Android) and using a bluetooth headset.  <answer257350> Ok this worked for me. Switched on bluetooth headphones and iTunes music was skipping. Left the sound running, switched off bluetooth keyboard and mouse and music became ok. Switched keyboard and mouse back on and music was still fine. So I don't know whether it's a priority device issue or what but it worked for me :-)  <answer261679> wireless mouse interferes with bluetooth  <answer274977> I tried all the listed solutions and nothing worked for me on MAC Sierra.  Just the:      sudo killall coreaudiod   worked for me but only for max 1 hour. Than I had to reenter which is quite annoying.  The bluetooth sound quality was dropping extremely especially while playing videos (high CPU and memory usage). It was unbearable.  What finally worked:  I activated the sound equalizer which I already had installed but never used: "boom2" (unfortunately not a free applications; may be there are other apps free which might work as well).  This software resides between the Audio source (in my case Video application) and the bluetooth processing unit of MAC Sierra.  Because the bluetooth part remains in this solution unchanged the problem can not be related to bluetooth buffers or frequency interference on the radio waves itself.  It is a problem of the operating system itself.  I hope this solution might help others as well but I can not assure that this works in your specific environment.  fregatte  <answer288236> I have a similar problem. My bluetooth headphone was working perfectly, but it started getting choppy somehow, and I did answer a phone call via FaceTime.  The stuttering only happens when the current application is Chrome or Safari. Restarting the browsers and/or disabling extensions or closing some of the tabs didn't fix the issue.  My workaround is to go to System Preferences - Sound - Input. As long System Preferences stays in that screen, it doesn't stutter anymore when I switch back to Chrome or Safari... But then my bluetooth magic pad gets a bit laggy, though it's tolerable...  <comment277265> Thanks for your response, I am having the same problem. Trying out your suggestion to disable handoff. Will report on the results <comment285807> Didn't do the trick for me (MacBook Pro, 15-inch, Mid 2015). And for those looking, handoff can be disabled from System Preferences  General  Allow Handoff (...) <comment289432> Disabling hand-off in my mid-2014 Macbook Pro 13" El Cap 10.11.4 seems to have worked. <comment302977> and for how many days did this work? I can reboot and is OK for a day <comment325209> Looks like in this P & R & Alt instruction tambourine and rat tails are missing <comment327691> just turn it off and use track pad while you play or use bluetooth <comment328464> Didn't work for me either (MacBook Pro 15" macOS Sierra 10.12.1). <comment345835> Boom2 is well-known 'crapware' & is best left alone, well away from your Mac. <comment358464> This solution is great!!!!!! Thanks so much this was driving me crazy.    sudo killall coreaudiod totally fixed my problem!     Boom2 is great software if you need it!!! I've used it for years to be able to hear media on my macbook air that was too quiet.  Unless you have something better, Tetsujin, I'm going to start using Boom2 for this. <comment360664> What a terrible workaround, but disconnecting my headphones from my iPhone fixed this for me. I'm on macOS Sierra and I have Plantronics Backbeat Pro headphones. <comment363999> Welcome to Ask Different. Please don't add comments in the _Answer_ field as this is for answers to questions.
