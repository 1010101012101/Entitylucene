How do you turn off the Bedtime app alarm if you wake up before it? <body> I've updated my phone to IOS10, one of the features I quite like is the bedtime app (and no longer needing a 3rd party app). Whilst the features are pretty easy to figure out I can't seem to figure out... how to turn off the Bedtime app alarm if you wake up before it?  E.g I woke up before the app, left the room, came back and the alarm was going off. Ideally I wanted to stop it before it started.  <answer254825> After setting it up, there is no way to turn it off; you can just edit the time you want to wake up and the hours you want to sleep. You can, however, turn off the wake alarm.  <answer258047> To reiterate you will do the following.  ol liSwipe up from the bottom of the screen. This will bring up your control center./li liTap timer./li liTap the bed time tab./li liSwitch off the whole thing by sliding the switch somewhere near the top to off./li /ol  Note, I'm visually impaired  so I'm depending on what my screen reader says the switches are to slide. If I'm wrong adjust where the switches are on your interface.  <comment314627> I have the same problem, it kept going off even when I had tapped the Snooze button but then would ring again every 8 minute. I turned it off with the switch for now... also it doesn't write any data in the chart at the bottom <comment315585> Mine gives me 1-5 minutes of sleep every morning right before the alarm goes offâ€¦ Not sure which is better  <comment330611> I suspect this will also stop the Clock app from writing your sleep data to the Health app. <comment331645> It will, but you can always add this manually or use a different sleep data tracker for ios.
