starting mysql from the console and my.cnf <body> Is this possible to start mysql from the console.   I tried with strongmysqld start/strong but it fails to start, how to start it?  I didn't find strongmy.cnf/strong in Mac, I wanted to change strongdatadir/strong settings, if there any way to do this?  Thanks!  <answer39224> To start mysql, run codemysqld_safe &amp;/code. The ampersand at the end starts the process in the background, so you can continue to work while it runs. Most likely, it needs root privileges to run, so add codesudo/code to the front if it doesn't work without (you will need to be logged in as an administrator).  By default, there is no codemy.cnf/code file. Defaults are used automatically. There are a few different starting files in the codesupport-files/code folder, for different usage styles. You can copy any of them to start with, and place the file in any of these locations (in order searched): /etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf $MYSQL_DIR/etc/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf
