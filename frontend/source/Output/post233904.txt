How do I backup 2 external hard disks to 1 external hard disk? <body> I currently own two 2 TB external hard disk and one 5 TB external hard disk. Is it possible to backup the two 2 TB external HDDs to the 5 TB external HDD using my Mac?  <answer233906> This can even be done in Time Machine:  Choose the 5 TB HDD as only Time Machine backup drive (OK, my disks are smaller  ):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N8bfe.png" alt="Choose backup drive"  Then exclude your internal drive by adding it to the excluded items - the backup drive is excluded automatically:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IF4Lu.png" alt="exclude items Time Machine"  The final result:  You get a folder emBackups.backupdb/em with one folder emvm/em (the name of my Mac) containing folders (with date names representing the backup date) and each with two folders representing the two drives (emData1/em and emEncrypted/em). I added and modified files successively on both volumes and initiated a backup after each step.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/riYMB.png" alt="final result"  hr  strongNeedless to say: it's recommended to backup your main drive/system drive also!/strong  <comment285856> And Time Machine will backup both 2TB externals to the 5TB? How will the contents of each 2TB external be separated in the 5TB? Via 2 main folders? <comment285857> @mannyrothman I will add screenshots soon! <comment285860> Awesome guide! Thank you so much! :)
