Black screen after chime before booting <body> I have a mid 2014 rMBP 13". When turning it on, I can hear the chime and then the screen remains black for a variable amount of time between 15-25 seconds.  It doesn't always happen, the issue seems to be random (but it happens really often, I'd say more than 70% of the times).  After those 15-25 seconds with the black screen, it goes on to the Apple logo or the Bootcamp menu if I had the ALT key pressed. Most importantly, when this issue happens (i.e. when the screen is black for 15-25 seconds on boot), if I start Windows it complains about several hardware failures and the SD card slot is reported as "unplugged". And Mac OS has a laggy touchpad for a little while. When the issue doesn't happen, everything is completely normal, no failures on any OS.  Things I have tried:  ul liRemoving all peripherals/li liResetting PRAM/NVRAM/li liResetting SMC/li liRemoving Windows/li liReinstalling OS X/li liWiping whole disk and reinstalling OS X only/li liSlow OSX booting with black screen before apple logo/li /ul  Nothing helps  The problem is that strongthe computer has had its motherboard and SSD replaced under warranty, but the issue is still present/strong so I doubt it is related to a hardware issue.
