macOS Sierra: Localhost will not connect <body> I originally posted this here on October 18th and a user said I should ask it here:  I just updated to Sierra from El Capitan. When I went to continue my work on my localhost, which happens to be on my Mac, it stopped working. When I go to codehttp://localhost//code 1st it says "It works", when I reload the page, it says "This site canâ€™t be reached", the same when I go to codelocalhost/~matthew/code. It does not list all the files and folders like it should. Does anybody know why or have had a similar problem? Any way to fix it? I've checked Terminal and localhost is in fact running.  I've already tried using codelocalhost/~matthew//code, codehttp://localhost/~matthew//code and code[actual ip address]/~matthew//code. None of these work.  The server is apache. The codeSites/code folder is already in place under codeUsers/Matthew//code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d5m0p.png" alt="Localhost on macOS Sierra won&#39;t work"  <comment328920> Things have changed between OS X 10.11 and macOS 10.12 in reference to Apache and PHP. Have a look at [How to Set up Apache in macOS Sierra 10.12](http://digitalshore.io/local-web-development-environment-apache-macos-sierra-10-12/), which also address PHP. <comment328922> Tried this and it doesn't work. <comment328924> @MatthewCampbell Which set-up guide did you use and what's the content of your hosts file (/etc/hosts)? <comment328927> Out of personal anecdotal experience: Are you connected to a proxy? If so, try disconnecting. <comment330171> @bluefirex I don't believe I am.
