View All Assigned Keyboard Shortcuts <body> Is there a way (probably an app) that lets you see all global (and possibly local) keyboard shortcuts that have been defined? Something similar to ActiveHotkeys on Windows. I dislike assigning new keyboard shortcuts without being sure that they won't cause shortcut collision.  <answer17137> I'm not a Windows user so I'm unsure of what ActiveHotKeys does. However, on System Preferences on the Mac OS X, there's a Keyboard preferences which when clicked will display "Keyboard Shortcuts" (the choice to the right of "Keyboard").  Hope this helps, and please mark your question as answered if this is what you're looking for.  <answer17167> There is a rather expensive program that does just this. I installed it on several classroom Macs, to help new users learn keyboard shortcuts:   ul liKeyCue by Ergonis Software. /li /ul  Works well, easy to use, but at $28.00 a little pricy.  <answer108293> There is a cool widget for dashboard by dashkards that has both general OSX shortcuts as well as a good list for several common apps. Its got a small ad banner, but it's quick to access which is nice. http://dashkards.com  <answer108294> There is a very nice app that's freely available to show you all shortcuts when you hold down the command key a bit longer than normal.  ul lihttp://www.cheatsheetapp.com/CheatSheet//li /ul  It works on Mavericks and several older OS and I've never had problems with it other than forgetting to quit it after I'm done discovering shortcut keys. It appears to be advertisement supported, so consider that if you prefer to pay to support developers as opposed to be part of what's being sold.  <comment18646> That's a great first question. I hope someone has an equally great answer! <comment18653> Sorry, I realized I didn't really explain at all what ActiveHotKeys does, and that link isn't that helpful. http://www.freewaregenius.com/2009/05/06/activehotkeys-reveals-used-hotkeys-on-your-system/ does a better explanation; basically, it shows you all shortcuts that are assigned to all applications. <comment18724> This looks great. $28 is a little pricy for a utility like this, but I think the trial version should suffice. <comment127482> Related to collisions: [Global keyboard shortcut conflicts](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/13410/8546) <comment127483> It's a great app but for minimising the risk of collision, it doesn't show *all* shortcuts. (Neither does KeyCue, but KeyCue *can* show more.)
