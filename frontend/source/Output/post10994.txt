Can I do anything to have my iPod Touch (2nd gen) louder? <body> To me, It's quite difficult to understand podcast when there is some noise around, for instance in noisy subway. I think I've read something about the weak output sound level of the iPod touch 2nd gen...  Is there any means to increase the sound of poscast on that device ?  <answer10996> Directly on the iPod, I don't think so, if your sound settings are maxed.  Try     strongSettings/strong  strongiPod/strong  strongVolume Limit/strong : Off   and     strongSettings/strong  strongiPod/strong  strongSound Check/strong : Off   hr  On iTunes, go to the "Info" window of the podcast audio file, and in the strongOption/strong tab, try to see if you can set the audio volume to 200%. I know it works on music, but it should also be available for the podcasts.
