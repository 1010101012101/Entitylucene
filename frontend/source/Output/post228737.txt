Is there a configuration for El Cap 'Find Your Cursor' to work for vertical shakes? <body> As one of the El Cap features, Apple touts:     strongFind your cursor/strong      Rapidly shake your finger on the surface of your trackpad to increase the size of the pointer so itâ€™s easy to spot. You can also shake your mouse to enlarge the pointer.   I find that I place my right hand to the right of the trackpad and use my index finger and when I try to perform a "shake" there is a much larger vertical component to the action. I thought this new feature wasn't even turned on because my shake never made the cursor grow in size.  However, I adjusted my hand position and made the shake much more horizontal and I see the special effect. The problem is this is an unnatural position for me to use the trackpad.  Is there a way to toggle how much horizontal or vertical components are required for a shake to trigger the cursor size to grow?  <answer228740> The only option is to disable this feature, found in System Preferences  Accessibility  Display.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGWHs.png" alt=""  I translate "back and forth" as being horizontal movement only. There are no options for adjusting the sensitivity, or for registering vertical movement.
