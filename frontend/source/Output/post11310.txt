How can I select files in Midnight Commander on a MacBook Pro? <body> I find really annoying to use Midnight Commander under OS X when using the non-extended keyboard (laptop).  I found no way of simulating an INSERT key press (select file) and I would like to find a solution that does not require me to reconfigure MC, specially because I cannot do this with each machine I'm connecting to from my MacBook.  I will give extra bonus ;) for and extended solution what will solve the problem not only for the INSERT (select file) but also for switch selection and add/substract selection (NumMultiply,NumMinus,NumPlus).   Remember that Numlock area *, + and - are not the same as the ones from the standard keyboard.   <answer11312> Control+T will select files:  http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2008/06/07/mac-os-x-and-midnight-commander-the-missing-insert-key/  <answer11351> Ctrl-T is standard hotkey for file selection â€” http://linux.die.net/man/1/mc.  As for switch/add/substract, just type shift-8 for *, shift-= for + and - for minus.   All this works in MC out of the box.  <answer28726> For those like me who were drawn here by a Google search based on the title of the question (not relating to Midnight Commander), I still haven't found a great solution.  However, for Word processors (a common usage of needing to find the "insert" key to toggle Insert/Overwrite mode), you should be able to click the text that says "INSRT" or "OVER"/"OVWT" in the status bar on the bottom of the Word Processor to change modes, as detailed here for Open Office.  Not awesome, but at least functional.  If neither Midnight Commander nor a Word Processor drew you here, then...good luck in your quest!  <comment11870> ^T works but the others do not and I tried to use an external keyboard and when I press *, + or - from the keypad it will work. <comment11874> That's strange. Works for me though (with iTerm2). What happens then? Make sure your command line is clear when you do that. <comment11884> Interesting, I am also using iTerm2 and pressing the keypad *-+ it doesn't bring the selection window. <comment11934> That's all I can help you with, unfortunately.
