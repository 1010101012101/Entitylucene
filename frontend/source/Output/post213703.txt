Prevent a program (steam) to start for a time period <body> Out of habit I play games, but it's something that I'd like to change without deleting all of the games I have. So I was wondering if it's possible to prevent steam from starting in the same way there are apps that block you from accessing the internet.   <answer213705> How do you launch Steam?  I think you could create some kind of scheduled task in Automator/cron that either moves Steam.app to another location (preventing your Dock icon from working) or, if you use Spotlight, somehow breaking the application bundle.  For example, you could disable with:  precodemkdir ~/NoSteam/ mv /Applications/Steam.app/Contents ~/NoSteam/ /code/pre  And re-enable with:  precodemv ~/NoSteam/Contents/ /Applications/Steam.app /code/pre  Kludgy but effective.  <comment257990> I suggest `chmod -x /Applications/Steam.app/Contents/MacOS/Steam` to disable it, and `+x` to reenable it. This uses features as intended. <comment257991> Max's suggestions is reasonable - more graceful than mine! <comment258013> There are lots of third party apps for that. At the end of the day, if you're setting up a system to stop yourself, you'd easily beat it if not spend loads of time trying to. Simple solution is work on your self control.
