Postfix auto start on Sierra for smtp relay <body> Postfix works great when I start it manually.  Can relay off of it from other hosts on my network; telnet to it on port 25 etc.  How do I get it to auto start such that It will always be listening on port 25?  I understand it starts up every minute or so and sends whatever has been manually written to the queue (like with the mail command) but I want it listening for connections on port 25 (Which it does if I start it manually).  I've found a bunch of things online but can't get any to work (they seem to apply to previous versions of OS X).  <answer268405> To get this working on Sierra you have to modify the existing launch daemon slightly:  ul liDisable SIP/li liModify em/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist/em:  precodesudo nano /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist /code/pre  remove the lines:  precode&lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string&gt;60&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  add the lines:  precode&lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  save the file and exit nano/li liReload the launch daemon:  precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.postfix.master.plist /code/pre/li liEnable SIP/li /ul  <answer274982> It is not necessary or recommended to modify plists in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons â€“ rather make a copy in /Library/LaunchDaemons and modify that.  <comment345837> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed. <comment345993> Confirmed: this is the way my Postfix server runs :).
