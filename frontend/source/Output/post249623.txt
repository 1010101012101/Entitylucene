How to check for internal damage after a fall? <body> Without taking the mac apart since I tend to break things easily. Wasn't a really huge fall about 2-4 feet. Landed upside down and no visible damage.  <answer249629> If your mac is running the most El Capitan (OS X 10.11.x), and was made after 2012, you can perform the Apple Hardware Test (instructions see Method 1). If the mac was made before 2012, or is not running OS X 10.8.4 or above, you will have to follow the second set of instructions I will include in this guide.  hr  Method 1  ol liDisconnect all cables, with exception to the power adapter (which is required to continue), keyboard, mouse, Ethernet cable, and display./li liPower off your computer, then power it on using the power button located on the computer. /li liPress the 'D' key on the computer while starting up, but before the grey screen appears./li liWait for a minute or two, and select your language./li liTo perform a quick check, you may press the t button, or return./li liTo perform a thorough check, you must select "perform extended testing"./li liThe status of the check will appear in the bottom right of the screen./li /ol  Method 2  ol liSee step one through step 3 in method 1./li liFollow onscreen instructions./li /ol  Sources:   https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18765  https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201257  <comment309724> What year and model is your mac? You can find this under the ï£¿, and clicking 'About this Mac'. I just want the type and year to walk you through the Hardware Diagnostics and Testing. <comment309725> 13 inch mid 2012 Mac Book Air <comment309726> Dunno why but it feels like the mac seems to perform better now compared to before <comment309728> The hardware test likely cleared the RAM caches and reset the PRAM. <comment309730> I understand this is off topic, but for improved performance, clear the PRAM before a boot, see this Apple support article. https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204063
