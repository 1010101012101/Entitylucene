Unexplained file share mount requests <body> I have lately been developing some lighting control software, which is working with the Open Lighting Architecture (I installed that via Homebrew, codebrew install ola/code). All is working fine, but there is one annoying side effect which neither I nor the OLA developers have been able to explain. Whenever I fire up the OLA daemon, generally by running codeolad/code in a Terminal window, a few moments after the daemon starts I get prompted for credentials to mount a file share on the Mac Mini which I have set up as a media server in my living room: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mR6TX.png" alt="Mount request dialog"  Or, if I am not at home, after a longer delay I get an error dialog reporting that the server cannot be found.  This is nothing but a minor annoyance: It does not interfere with the startup or operation of codeolad/code If I dismiss the dialog, it doesn’t bother me until the next time I stop and launch the daemon. If, on the other hand, I enter my credentials, I can stop and restart the daemon without further interruption, as long as I am at home and Puck is reachable. In that scenario, codemount/code shows me the following:  precode➜ ~ mount /dev/disk1 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) //james@Puck._afpovertcp._tcp.local/Macintosh%20HD on /Volumes/Macintosh HD (afpfs, nobrowse) /code/pre  The last line is not present until I respond to the authentication dialog. I have no idea why something is trying to perform that mount. Nothing in the codeolad/code configuration files refer to it, and I have no Login Items which attempt to mount it. There clearly must be some alias or configuration file in the directories that codeolad/code traverses when searching for lighting interfaces which causes this, but I am at a loss to explain or find it. Can anyone help me figure out how to stop this?  One note, I did try looking in code/etc/auto_home/code, code/etc/auto_master/code, and code/etc/autofs.conf/code after Googling around for ideas, and none of them contain anything which looks at all suspicious to me. Any assistance towards enlightenment would be greatly appreciated!  For what it’s worth, I am running OS X 10.10.3 on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013). This was happening under 10.10.2 as well.  <comment249580> For whatever reason, this has stopped happening. So, I am glad about that, although I still wish I had some clue why it had been happening for so long.
