App Icons Go White - 2nd Gen iPod touch iOS 4.2 <body> I have 2 iPod touch labs (15 in each) and on occasion all of the app icons just turn white (not on all of them, just one or two at a time).  The apps still work, but the only way I can find to restore it is to wipe the iPod and re install the apps.  What would be causing this? These are 2nd generation iPod touches so they can't go to anything past 4.2
