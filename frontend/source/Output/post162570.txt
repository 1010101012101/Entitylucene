How do I change permissions of folders on a hard drive from a booted USB drive <body> I am trying to save my files on my Hard Drive that has a crashed OS. I created a Bootable USB with Ubuntu and successfully booted.  I can see my folders, but I can't actually open them because I don't have permission.  I tried to do this:  precodesudo chmod 777 -R Pictures /code/pre  Where codePictures/code is the name of the folder I want to change permissions to.  All I want to be able to do is to copy the folders &amp; files from my Hard Drive to my USB drive.  How do I do that?  <answer162706> For anyone else that has this issue, the guys over at AskUbuntu solved it for me.

What do you see if you type "ls -l" in the folder containing the Pictures folder? Also try "id -u yourusername", what do you get?
