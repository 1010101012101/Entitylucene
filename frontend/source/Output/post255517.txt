Mail encoding issue <body> I have a problem with Mail. My name is Oğuz and there is a Turkish character in my name. I set up a 'live' email address in Mail. When I send an email from a web browser my name appears as "Oğuz", but when I send one from Mail my name appears as "O?uz". Also, other Turkish characters in my last name do not appear correctly. How do I fix this issue?   <answer256174> I have solved this issue.   1-) Create a new contact using name which you want to use as e-mail sender name. 2-) Add email account that contact.
