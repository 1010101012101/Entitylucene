Default email signing with OS X Mail <body> I have both a GPG key and an SSL certificate. I am able to sign emails by choosing OpenPGP or S/MIME in the upper right corner of the window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0BwlB.png" alt="Signing drop-down"  I can then activate the signing by clicking the appropriate icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DC4uk.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now my question(s):  ul liis it possible to sign by default? (always unless specified)/li liis it possible to sign by default only for a given account?/li /ul  strongEdit 1/strong  The ideal setup with three accounts would be  ol listrongaccount 1 always signs with S/MIME (the address is in the S/MIME certificate)/strong/li liaccount 2 always signs with GPG (the address is in the GPG certificate)/li liaccount 3 do not sign (the address is not present in any certificate)/li /ol  strongEdit 2/strong  The priority is the S/MIME certificate, I could also live without GPG where only account 1 is using the S/MIME certificate by default.  strongEdit 3/strong  I was now able to set S/MIME as the default (see emDefine the security method to be used/em, in the GPGMail 2 hidden settings FAQ). When I then switch to account 2 (the one with the GPG key) the default falls back to GPG (as the address of account 2 is not present in the S/MIME certificate).  precodedefaults write org.gpgtools.gpgmail DefaultSecurityMethod -int 2 /code/pre  So far so good, now I just have to find out how to sign by default with S/MIME (and not with GPG)  <answer213355> I have some email accounts that use S/MIME and some that use GPG. When I select to use the email address configured for GPG, GPG email signing is enabled by default. When I select to use the email address configured for S/MIME, the S/MIME email signing is enabled by default.  I had to enable some settings in the GPG preference section of Mail.app, but nothing else.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uyf92.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PfDZJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Itjm3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment206241> OS X Mail.app default behaviour is to keep the last signature button state for all new mails of an account if an S/MIME certificate for the current account is present. If that doesn’t happen for you, I suspect the GPG plug-in is to blame. What happens when you enable GPG’s hidden [Enable/Disable Sign by default](http://support.gpgtools.org/kb/gpgmail-faq/gpgmail-2-hidden-settings#enable-disable-sign-by-default) preference? <comment210773> This preference is no longer hidden. Enabling it enables Sign By Default for both S/MIME and GPG. (which is what I was looking for when arriving at this question) <comment210803> @GhostLyrics What I would like it to be able to handle both separately: S/MIME enabled by default and GPG disabled by default. <comment257555> "is it possible to sign by default? (always unless specified)" Yes. This is set via GPG. <comment257568> Mail.app already does what you are requesting. I have email accounts that use S/MIME and some that use GPG.  When I select to use the email address configured for GPG, the GPG sign is enabled by default for signing.  When I select to use the email address configured for S/MIME, the S/MIME signing is enabled by default.
