Keyboard not responding after plugging in USB device <body> I have MacBook Pro Retina and this issue happens to me very often as I am android developer. Sometime after I plug my Android phone to the USB, my macs keyboard stops responding and only way is to reboot system. I think I managed to brake the keyboard once with a simple pendrive...  I've extracted some logs from the moment the issue happened again. I'mpretty sure if there is anything, there must be in few last ones.  precode14.07.2014 21:30:18,524 Terminal[1927]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x1b400005 14.07.2014 21:30:23,987 Google Chrome[356]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x0b42bfb3 14.07.2014 21:30:23,987 Google Chrome[356]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x0b42bfb4 14.07.2014 21:30:23,987 Google Chrome[356]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x1b400005 14.07.2014 21:30:37,762 Google Chrome[356]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x0b42bfb3 14.07.2014 21:30:37,762 Google Chrome[356]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x0b42bfb4 14.07.2014 21:30:37,762 Google Chrome[356]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x1b400005 14.07.2014 21:37:03,000 kernel[0]: CODE SIGNING: cs_invalid_page(0x1000): p=10814[GoogleSoftwareUp] final status 0x0, allowing (remove VALID) page 14.07.2014 21:37:33,267 com.apple.kextd[12]: Can't create kext cache under / - owner not root. 14.07.2014 21:37:33,276 com.apple.kextd[12]: Can't create kext cache under / - owner not root. 14.07.2014 21:37:34,000 kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::message - kIOUSBMessagePortHasBeenReset. 14.07.2014 21:37:34,000 kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::message - kIOUSBMessagePortHasBeenReset. 14.07.2014 21:37:35,000 kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::_deviceGetReport - DeviceRequest for reportID 0x0 returned with result 0xe000404f - retrying 14.07.2014 21:37:36,273 WindowServer[146]: disable_update_timeout: UI updates were forcibly disabled by application "Android File Transfer" for over 1.00 seconds.

You will see lots of text there, just look at the bottom one and plug in the USB. Now copy some 10 lines after you plugged in the USB and paste in here. <comment163508> I'll paste it as soon I encounter the issue again <comment163509> ok, if you want to alert me, use the @Buscar웃 in your text, otherwise I might not see your update. <comment163865> @Buscar웃 I've managed to reproduce issues and paste some logs. I don't see anything spcific in them however. I'm pretty sure that the issue happened after 21:37, but pasting more just in case.
