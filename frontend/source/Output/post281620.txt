How to sync passwords between Chrome and iCloud Keychain <body> I'd like to use Chrome (currently Version 57.0.2987.133 (64-bit)) and on my iPad I'd like to use Safari (obviously). Since 10.10 the sync between Chrome and MacOS Keychain stopped working for me.  Is there any trick to make this work again?  em1Password or other 3rd party password managers are currently no option for me, as I don't trust their security. (see here or here)/em  <comment354425> Just wanted to let you know I've used 1Password for a number of years and have been very happy with it across all my devices. It is constantly updated, so I'm sure they're on top of patching vulnerabilities. Evenso, I don't use it with iCloud (or any cloud service) and personally don't use the various web browser extensions. Having worked in the IT Security field, I know we can only ever _manage_ the risk, not eliminate it. That's why I choose not to use anything to store passwords etc in the cloud (not even Keychain), but I _may_ be overly cautious in that choice. <comment354565> @Monomeeth how do you sync passwords between devices? Manually? <comment354566> After the initial setup (when a lot of entries are made), adding new entries doesn't happen often. And since it's not common, syncing manually is no big deal (and it's very quick). For example, if I'm away from home and I've added a new password (or whatever) into the 1Password app on my iPhone, all I need to do when at home is launch the 1Password app on the Mac select the necessary option and the data is synced between both devices. It's all over in less than a minute, and data goes both ways (e.g. if my wife added a new password at home, it's now also on my iPhone). Works for me.
