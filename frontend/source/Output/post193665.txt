Different UI for same version of YouTube official iOS app <body> I have the same version (10.22.11614) of the official YouTube app in my iPhone 6 and iPhone 5, but the UI is not same in both of my phones.   My iPhone 5 has the new material design and my iPhone 6 has the old UI.  Why for the same version I'm having two different UIs?  strongiPhone  5/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IKinG.png" alt="iPhone 5"  strongiPhone 6/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FcMGL.png" alt="iPhone 6"  <answer193687> According to this blog Google is testing the Material Design YouTube app.  One of my phone is part it the other one is not.   <comment230886> Must be something to do with iPhone 5. I have a iPhone 5s and I get the non material design UI only.
