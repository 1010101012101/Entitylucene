Extending searching into the archives folder in Mail.app <body> When I'm doing a search into my mailbox, Mail is not looking into the archives folder, and that is pretty annoying.  I checked "Look into every folder" into the preferences, but it doesn't change anything. If I want to look into the Archives folder, I have to click on it, and then I can type my search criteria.  Isn't it possible to search into this folder as well when I'm on my main folder?  <answer209551> Here is a solution fro this post that might help:  Alex     It appears that this is linked to Spotlight in some way.      I recently turned spotlight indexing back on for the volume holding my $HOME and immediately this started working again.      I assume that without the spotlight index it can't find the Archive directly automatically, then finds it via IMAP when I run through the steps in the question.   <comment252786> Thanks for replying. The thing is, I'm not using spotlight at all, I'm using alfred. But what's the point with spotlight in this case, I'm not sure I understand. Thanks ! <comment252788> @guillaumeb, I don't understand either. [sheepish grin] <comment252790> @guillaumeb, the solution. <comment252791> Great. Let's hope someone is going to help me. Thanks a lot anyway ! <comment252792> @guillaumeb, just to let you know, I think I will leave the answer there just incase it helps someone who stumbles across this question later. <comment253217> Anyone can help me ? I'm feeling alone here. :) Thanks
