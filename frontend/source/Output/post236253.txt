Export an iMovie project to QuickTime to import into another iMovie project <body> I have iMovie '11 and wish to export an iMovie project to a mov file that I can import into another iMovie project. How can I do this?  <answer236256> Open the project, then select strongShare/strong → strongExport Movie/strong.  Select a destination and other options if relevant, then select Export. Once the project is exported, you can import it just like any other video.  More information: iMovie ‘11: Export your movies to a Finder folder
