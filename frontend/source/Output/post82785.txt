I want to buy a game that uses a different currency <body> I am trying to buy an app that costs 399Â¥ , but I use dollars and have no way of getting yen... I live in America . The game isn't sold here and I wasn't allowed to purchase. It said my account wasn't authorized.... Is there anyway for me to get the game, like buying yen with dollars , or is it just reserved for people in Japan ?    <answer82786> You can just create a second iTunes account in another country. It's a bit of a hassle when you have to update your apps (you have to switch accounts), but if you really want that app, it's worth it.  If you've jailbroken your iPhone, you can tackle this issue with iUsers.
