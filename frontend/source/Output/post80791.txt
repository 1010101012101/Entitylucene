Command line tool to convert DOC and DOCX files to PDF <body> Is there any command line tool to convert DOC and DOCX files to PDF? If no, can it be automated by some Automator script (open-print to PDF-close)?  <answer81191> If you have Office:Mac 2008 Business Edition or Office:Mac 2011 Home/Business Edition, Automator actions are included with those editions.  One of the Automator actions included with those versions of Office:Mac is "Convert Format of Word Documents", and one of the options in that Automator action is PDF.  This page has great information about Automator and Office:Mac.  If you have Home/Student Edition instead of Business Edition, or don't have Office at all, you can accomplish it via AppleScript.  Mac OS X Hints has an article about bulk converting text files to PDF via AppleScript, and the comments to that article give some options to convert DOC/DOCX to PDF via RTF.  That might result in a loss of formatting or linking if you've got very complex DOC/DOCX files, but might be sufficient for files that aren't terribly complex.  <answer250554> In Office 2016 the Automator approach will run into issues due to security sandboxing. (The symptom: Word stays open, and you get an "Error while printing" dialog.)  A workaround is to install LibreOffice, which can be used to convert files from the command line. On MacOS, the command is:  precode/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice \   --headless \   --convert-to pdf \   myfile.docx /code/pre  The PDF will only be as good as LibreOffice's conversion from MS Office, of course, but it's adequate for many purposes.  Another approach, if you emreally/em don't care about formatting, is to use codepandoc/code and LaTeX:  precodepandoc -t latex myfile.docx -o myfile.pdf /code/pre  You'll need to install pandoc and LaTeX as described in this answer, though, and your PDF will come out looking like a LaTex document -- basic formatting, headers, lists, etc. will generally be preserved, but things like fonts and margins won't.
