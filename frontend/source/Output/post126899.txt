Left Command key does not have the same function as the Right Command key <body> Since updating my computer to Mavericks all my commands have gone wonky.  My main key problem is my left command key. The right one works correctly with all the shortcuts I use, but the left one zooms out the screen and puts similar applications side by side.  I've tried a lot with System Preferences but since I am new to Mavericks it's hard to find what I am looking for.  <answer126921> Go to strongSystem Preferences  Mission Control/strong and check the shortcut for strongApplication windows/strong. It must be set on the left kbdâŒ˜/kbd key (this must be the only OS X section that accepts single modifier keys).  Mission Control http://cdn.mactrast.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Mission_Control-582x480.png  <answer169879> I had the same problem. At first I didn't have a problem until I chose Restore Defaults in the keyboard menu shortcuts. From that moment I had the same problem with the left command key.  I checked Mission Control and the command-left keyboard shortcut was not selected, so I didn't see any problem there but just to make sure I selected every shortcut again and the problem is gone.
