Privacy Pane wont let me add a preference pane to control my computer <body> I have a 2010 Macbook Pro 15 inch and i just upgraded to yosemite with a fresh install (no data on any hard drives). I am trying to set up FunctionFlipper, a third party preference pane that will let me turn my dashboard key into another key (i ant to use it to show launchpad).  I installed it even though its from an unidentified developer by opening it manually with command click and open. But to use it i need to add FunctionFlip.prefpane to my list of apps that can control my computer under the privacy tab. When i unlock it to be edited and hit the plus button, i navigate to Libraries - Preference Pane but the functionflip.prefpane is grayed out and it wont let me add it to the list.  How do i add Function Flipper to the list of apps that are allowed to control my computer?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VQW4Y.png" alt="screenshot of greyed out pref pane"  <answer155605> This is a known bug in the latest OS X Yosemite. You can’t select or drag codeprefPane/code extension file from the Finder window dialog.  When you’re prompted with the same screen, press kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd and enter the path to the packaged application at:   code~/Library/PreferencePanes/FunctionFlip.prefPane/Contents/Resources//code  Check out the gif to see how it works.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fd8el.gif" alt="Move PrefPane packaged application into Security &amp; Privacy"  <comment183059> Allow access to FunctionFlipper app to control your computer in sys pref Security privacy. <comment183060> thats the problem, thats exactly what i am trying to do. But FunctionFlipper.app is inside FunctionFlipper.prefpane and it wont let me click the .prefpane because its greyed out. <comment183068> maybe I do not understand- go to system preferences- security and privacy- privacy tab- select accessibility- is the FunctionFlipper showing there? <comment183069> No, and when i click the plus button to add functionflipper and navigate to it in the finder it is grayed out and cant click on it to add <comment183077> Thanks for the reply! I did exactly as you said and it showed the FunctionFlip.app in the Resources folder after i manually entered the path, but when i clicked FunctionFlip.app and hit open it did not add it to the list, my list remains completely empty. <comment183081> function flip seems to be working, but it isnt listed in the apps. So it behaves as if it is listed but is invisible in the list... <comment183228> Great, if the answer addresses your problem, please choose it as answer to mark this as answered. <comment183432> i guess it does, its just weird it is invisible in my privacy pane
