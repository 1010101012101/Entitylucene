Is there a file copy utility for OS X that's similar to TeraCopy for Windows? <body> On Windows, I use TeraCopy for improved file copying. Are there any similar equivalents for OS X?  In particular, I'd like to see things like copy speed.  <answer4418> I looked around for something like TeraCopy a while back but everything I found was pretty horrid.  In the end I decided to just use codecp/code and codersync/code on the command line.  <answer4436> Since you mentioned “better” and in particular “copy speed”, I believe the only answer is Xfile. Other than that, nothing will beat cp ;)     The world’s fastest file manager for OS X   It’s not free, quite the contrary.   <answer4462> Have you first compared speeds between TeraCopy and the built in Mac OS X file copy? I hate to sound like a generic condescending Mac user, but what exactly is wrong with the built in one?  <answer17667> Try Ultracopier, looks a bit like TeraCopy and works on Mac &amp; PC  About copy speed, all is same for the big file. Ultracopier (my software) is better for small file. But warning, I have this this big performance mistake:  ul liAll copy small file from network from into strong3s but 1min42s/strong for Teracopy/li liAll copy big file from network from into strong1min20s but 2min47s/strong for Copyhandler/li /ul  <answer22860> While much more than just a copy utility, Pathfinder shows copy speed. Along with Launchbar, it's one of my must have utilities.  <answer48034> The best suggestions from this thread are:  ul liPathfinder/li liXFile/li liUltraCopier/li liMiniCopier/li /ul  <answer56704> An app I developed, Ultracopier, fits your use case.  Here is a YouTube demo showcasing the PC version in action.   <answer148922> There is one application that I found online that works similar to tera copy, and that too for mac osx, named turbo copy pro: http://www.turbocopypro.com/  This is a multi-function application and you can view the copy speed and also pause and resume the copy process similar to tera copy. The only drawback it has is that it is not free.  I have tried and tested the trial version and it owrkds absolutely fine. Please have a look and post your review.  <answer256112> You may also consider Hedge for Mac tool. It's mostly for backup purposes and can be used to fast copy large files/folders. It has free version but most interesting features are to be paid.  <comment4222> aha, that makes sense. <comment4293> I would like to compare speeds, but the built in one does not tell me the copy speed. Unless there is a way? <comment4341> With maths...? Find a folder of weighty size (or a large file, but you'll get different results for one vs many files) and find out its size. Time how long it takes to copy. Divide size by time it took to copy, and you'll get the average speed. <comment4351> It would be nice if the UI would simply display the copy rate, as opposed to me having to do division. Because I'm lazy. :) <comment4357> Or you can install iStat (http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) and see the disk throughput in a nice graph/number… <comment25496> XFile also crashes **a lot**, and is not particularly fast *at all*, at least in my experience. <comment71205> Doesn't osx's own copier do just that? <comment71254> @foley do just what? afaik, it just shows you a progress bar. teracopy has considerably more features. <comment95486> This is the most useful answer of all <comment95490> If you can treat the Mac drive as an external drive, like a NAS, and do the copy from a windows machine, file pilot copy would work for you. They have a free “no registration required” eval download at http://www.filepilotsoftware.com . It is super fast, particularly for update copies, and has an easy to use GUI interface (but can also be run in a batch mode like a script). <comment95491> If you would list the specific features past a progress bar and time estimate, people here might have more suggestions. Are you still looking for a solution? <comment160763> Consider ForkLift: http://www.binarynights.com/forklift/. <comment297018> What is meant with the "All copy" and "from into" and "Copyhandler"?
