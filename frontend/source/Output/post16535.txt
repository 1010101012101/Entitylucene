Auto open textmate project on startup <body> How do I get textmate to remember what project i had open last and reopen it automatically?  Right now I have to select it from the menu.  <answer16536> By default TextMate should open the last open project or document - but it can be switched on/off - maybe it is off by you ??  Here is how to switch the feature on/off: http://manual.macromates.com/en/expert_preferences#oakdisablesessionrestore     strong22.7 OakDisableSessionRestore/strong      When you launch TextMate it will open the project / document which was open when you last exited. You can however disable this feature by running:      codedefaults write com.macromates.textmate OakDisableSessionRestore 1/code   This means that you should run the above line in a Terminal - with a 0 instead of 1  <answer99651> This command allowed me to re-open a project (I'm running Mountain Lion):  precode    defaults write com.macromates.textmate NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool NO /code/pre  TextMate needs to be strongclosed/strong when you issue Terminal commands, otherwise they will not work.  See this page for more information.  Make sure you created a TextMate project using TextMate. In other words, do not drag a folder into TextMate and assume that all the open-file states to be reloaded.  You must have a code.tmproj/code file into which you drag your files into.  <comment55143> Strange, totally not working for me, though this appears to be the "right" answer. <comment76418> not working for me also... Tried both: defaults write com.macromates.textmate NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool NO defaults write com.macromates.textmate OakDisableSessionRestore 0 Nothing seemed to get previous projects and files to open. Very frustrating.
