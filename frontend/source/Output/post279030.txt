After the image has been saved, can I still edit text-boxes & shapes in Preview.app? <body> If I add text boxes and shapes to an image using Preview.app, save that image, and then close the image window, the next time that I open the image in Preview, all additions are uneditable.  In other words, all edits are made permanent upon save.  Is there a way to retain the ability to modify markup elements in Preview.app?  <answer279037> No, the edits are saved directly to the image.  <answer280090> If you convert the image to a PDF, and then edit the PDF, you can edit the additions in Preview.app, even after saving.  To save an image as a PDF, you can use:  ul liemFile/em → emExport As PDF.../em/li liemFile/em → emExport.../em/li liemFile/em → emPrint/em → emPDF/em → emSave As PDF.../em/li /ul
