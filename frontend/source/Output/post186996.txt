What's the name of my sound card driver's file? <body> I want to run fuser to determine what process is using my sound card, but I don't know what file to use. I ran fuser on /System/Library/Extensions while playing a YouTube video, but did not see any process IDs.  <answer187645> If you have an idea of which process is making the sound, you might be able to try them until you find it.  For example, QuickTime Player, when playing a movie, does not use any subprocesses.  Similarly iTunes when it is playing a song.    On OS X 10.7 Lion, I did the following:    ul liopen Activity Monitor, /li liswitch to "All Processes, Hierarchically"/li lifound the application process I wanted and clicked it, /li liclicked Inspect/li liclicked Open Files and Ports/li /ul  <comment220953> i'm really not sure it works like that on Mac - [Mac fuser man](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/fuser.1.html) it's likely to all go through CoreAudio <comment354326> What kind of MacBook is it?  What version of the operating system is it running? Is the sound card the one supplied with the computer?
