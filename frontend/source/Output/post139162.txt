How to use latex2rtf without root installation <body> This is a very basic question, as I am a newbie on Unix systems. I have installed latex2rtf following the OS X specific instructions. As I do not have root rights (university computer), I installed Xcode to modify the Makefile:  precode#Base directory - adapt as needed # Unix: DESTDIR?=/Users/.../latex2rtf /code/pre  Where ... is my home folder. Then I run the commands codemake; make check; make install/code (could not use codesudo/code) and latex2rtf was installed to latex2rtf folder in my home directory. If I try to open latex2rtf file in bin folder, I get a new terminal window, where I can write anything without any kind of response. If I write latex2rtf in terminal I get a message: code-bash: latex2rtf: command not found/code    So a simple question: how do I use latex2rtf on OS X in this case?  <answer139259> Thanks to Mark for the solution, which was pretty basic, indeed:  Open your code.bash_profile/code file in Home directory (you can use terminal to open it, or tick "Show Hidden Items" in Finder on OS X 10.9.4). Add following to it:  codeexport PATH=$PATH:/Users/.../latex2rtf/bin/code  Where the part after ":" specifies the location of codelatex2rtf/code file. In this case "..." is the home directory.  Save the file and exit. Run following in terminal:  codesource $HOME/.bash_profile/code  codelatex2rtf/code command should work now in terminal. The code is from here.  <comment164143> You need to put /Users/.../latex2rtf on your PATH - Althogh for this software I would ask the system administrator how to get latex on the computer
