How can I share a Google Drive file to anyone on iOS? <body> When I am on my phone I can't figure out how to share a Google doc with anyone who has the link to the Google doc.  I can see how I can share with other people who are using my domain, and a part of my G Suite.  But I do not see how I can share a file with anyone who has the link to that file.  Can you help me?  <answer287624> If you're the G Suite administrator, you can control whether users can share their Drive files outside your organization. You can also set the default sharing options for new files created by users.  To allow users to share outside your organization to anyone:  ol liSign in to your strongGoogle Admin console/strong./li liFrom the Admin console dashboard, go to strongApps  G Suite  Drive and Docs/strong./li liClick strongSharing settings/strong./li liUnder strongSharing outside of emorganization/em/strong, select strongON/strong. Users can invite people outside the organization to view, comment on, and edit their files./li liSelect the options according to what you need./li /ol  You can fine tune the sharing settings. Read more at the G Suite docs.  <comment363194> That turns the link on for anyone in our org, not for the world. <comment363195> @AndrewWarner Are you the G Suite administrator? <comment363196> Yes @DakshShah. Is there something I can do as an admin? <comment363197> @AndrewWarner Edited my original answer! :)
