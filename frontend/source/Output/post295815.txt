Directory names with a dot (.) in macOS <body> I have a problem with folder naming in macOS â€” I need to name a folder with *.Menu in the end. But if I do that Finder thinks it's some sort of a system file and not a directory. The same goes with *.framework. Is there some setting in Finder to turn off this behaviour?  <comment373601> I would advise against using extensions that are used by the system for purpose other they what they are already registered for, for the system, as this may cause unwanted problems. I'd choose a different naming convention! <comment373605> You could use ._Menu for example.  Should please both you and Mac maybe. <comment373607> @john, nah, it doesn't look nice, but thanks for the idea :) Anyway, for now I decided to just make a whole hierarchy representing a namespace. It solves the problem, it's just I don't need a whole hierarchy for the moment. I think it's unfortunate that Apple decided to treat folders with special names as bundles. They should 've used zip archives with custom file extensions to represent .app, .framework and other system bundles.
