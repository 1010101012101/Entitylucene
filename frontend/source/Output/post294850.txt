Audacity Says "Error Locking Temporary Folder" and Won't Open <body> I was using Audacity and it kept saying that it couldn't save to the autosave folder. I went to turn it off and it said it couldn't save its user configuration file. Now, when I try to turn it off, it says "Error Locking Temporary Folder." What can I do to fix this issue?  <answer294851> There was not enough space on my computer, the hard drive was full. I had to delete some stuff in order to open Audacity again.
