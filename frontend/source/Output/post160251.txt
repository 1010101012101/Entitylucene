Time Machine space <body> I have a iMac with a hard drive of 1TB. Used 536 GB. It has an external hard drive of 1TB with Time Machine and the normal copies. The computer had a problem that did not afected the hard drive and has been 2 months to repair.     Now the iMac works well and I connect the external hard drive of 1TB for the Time Machine back up and it says that there is no space. It says "it needs 528 GB"  I do not undestand. Does it mean that it does not recognize the copy made 2 months ago? if I have 536GB used, isn't 1TB in the external drive enough ?   <answer160300> http://pondini.org has massive amounts of info on troubleshooting Time Machine. In particular, "Reconnecting"  to  your  backups may answer your question.  <comment188387> Time Machine may think it's a 'new' machine - open it, open backups.backupdb & see if it has 'myMac' & 'myMac(2)' listed. <comment188505> It seems that the only solution is to buy a new external hard drive and make a new copy from now. (as I do not want to delete the old copies) if I have 536GB used, do I need a 1TB hard drive or 2TB is necessary ? <comment188506> @Tetsujin. No, It has not created myMac(2) <comment188805> The steps on ["Reconnecting" to your backups](http://pondini.org/TM/B6.html) did not help you? <comment188900> I do not want to try the terminal. It is too risky for me. The rest of things does not work <comment190469> I understand your aversion to the Termimal, but sometimes it's the only way. Just be sure the source is reputable if you don't understand the commandsâ€”or take the time to learn enough UNIX to understand them :)
