VirtualBox "The screen resolution for this app to run" on Mac 1440 x 900 <body> I installed Virtual Box and Windows 8.1 from https://modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads The resolution of my display is code13-inch (1440 x 900)/code Also I installed Guest Additions.   I can't run most if not all of the application in Windows 8.1 due to the error "The screen resolution for this app to run". But my current resolution is the biggest one. Does the error mean that whatever I do I won't be able to solve that issue on my mac?  If so should I download Window 7 instead?
