Apple Music songs not showing up on iTunes Library <body> All music I've added to my Library from Apple Music is gone (The files I used to own before Apple Music still shows up). I went into the MusiciTunesiTunes Media directory and the Apple Music folder is still there with all the songs I've added organized by artist names. I tried dragging some of those to the "Automatically Add to iTunes" folder but it didn't work. Heck, I even tried dragging them manually one by one to the iTunes library and it still didn't work.  Please help me figure out how to get these Apple Music files show up on my iTunes library. Thanks in advance.  P.S. I searched those songs on Apple Music to add from there. Some don't have the option of "Add to My Music" while some would create a duplicate file in the iTunes MediaApple Music folder if that option exists and I click it (these songs do show up on Library).
