Mac OS X - Terminal window shows up but closes immediately <body> I'm using Mac OS X Lion 10.7. I open Terminal and its window shows up but immediately close and its icon remains in the dock. It's working fine a moment ago. I don't know what i have messed. I looked at the log file in the Console application and see "login: USER_PROCESS 172 ttys000"  <answer88796> What shell are you using?  Try flipping the default one.  I found a bad .profile configuration crashed bash, and temporarily switching to another shell to edit the .profile fixed my issue.  <answer88816> Try to hide the current code~/.bash_profile/code from your shell. Just rename it to code~/.bash_profile_bkp/code and see if something changes.  <answer88831> This looks as if there is an issue with one of the configuration files for your shell. To fix do  ol liWith Terminal still running, use kbdShift-Cmd-N/kbd to run codezsh/code/li liIn codezsh/code run codels -l .bashrc .profile/code and rename all files you found (codemv .bashrc .bashrc.save/code, codemv .profile .profile.save/code)/li liWith the window still open, type kbdCmd-T/kbd to open a new tab running codebash/code./li liAssuming this worked, review code.bashrc.save/code/code.profile.save/code (and anything called from there) for errors. You can also rename them back and run codelogin/code in the running shell which may show some errors from executing the scripts and give you some hints on where to look for problems./li liIn case running codebash/code in step 3 didn't work (tab closed again) you may also have to rename code/etc/profile/code and code/etc/bashrc/code with codesudo mv /etc/profile /etc/profile.save; sudo mv /etc/bashrc /etc/bashrc.save/code/li /ol  <answer187427> I recently had this issue because I uninstalled the version of bash installed by macports (code/opt/local/bin/bash/code) not realizing it was my default shell. The solution was to change my default shell back to code/bin/bash/code via the advanced user options in the Users &amp; Groups System Preferences. (See @sdmeyers' comment on @Pyrolistical's answer for instructions.)  <comment104101> Does this happen if you create a new user and then use that? <comment104104> Can you describe how the default shell can be changed? <comment104125> In the User & Groups System Preference, Right(Control)+Click on the user whose shell you want to change. This should present an "Advanced options..." option. Select it and it will bring up a pane allowing you to select a number of options including the Login shell. BTW, this option is really the only option I'd suggest ever changing.
