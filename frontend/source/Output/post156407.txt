Trouble with updates <body> Why can't I do updates on my new Notebook Air for Pages, Numbers and Garage Band.  I keep getting dialogue box that says it can't do the update either because the program was bought by a different user or it was cancelled. ???  <comment183882> Perhaps it's associated with another Apple ID.  Do you have more than one Apple ID (e.g. your icloud.com or me.com email address)?  Apps that you've previously downloaded/updated should be under your purchased tab in the App Store application.  I'm not sure what happens with apps that came pre-installed.  Perhaps they associate with the Apple ID first entered into the iCloud prefs pane... <comment183898> What version of OS X are you running?
