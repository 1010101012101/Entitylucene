Debounce mechanical keyboard in OS X <body> My work has me back on a Mac.  I am using my mechanical keyboard (USB, Cherry blue switches, not that that's important) with OS X.  The problem though, is that i get relatively frequent "bouncing" or "chatter" of the keystrokes.  For example, if i type codehello/code something like codeheello/code might appear.  This is rather annoying, especially when entering passwords.  Under Linux i could solve this in software by debouncing, using the codexkbsetbouncekeysdelay/code setting (adds a minimum number of milliseconds, like 40ms, between keypresses; rather a blunt tool but solves the problem perfectly).  However, i haven't been able to find an analogue under OS X.  Does anyone have any software-based suggestions?  Am i overlooking a simple plist setting somewhere?  <answer247141> Have you tried going to System Preferences-Keyboard and increasing "Delay Until Repeat"?  <comment304553> Can system preferences/accessibility/keyboard/Slow Keys help? <comment304880> No, i'd prefer not to have to hold down each key for longer (i type relatively fast), i simply want to introduce a minimum time between acceptance of new physical presses of the same key (note that this different from the key repeat and key delay settings, because i have the impression that my keyboard is actually firing multiple spurious keypresses in a very short timeframe).  Thanks though! <comment304943> As mentioned in the comment above, my issue is separate from the key repeat delay.  This value is in the order of a few hundred milliseconds, while the multiple keypresses (literally bouncing â€” this is the technical term for the phenomenon) are within about 30ms of each other, which is way too short to be caused by the software key repeat value you refer to.
