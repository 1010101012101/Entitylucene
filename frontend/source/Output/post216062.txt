Apple Hardware Test result: 4HDD/11/40000000: SATA(0,0). But repaired Disk and Permissions w/o a problem <body> Ran an Apple Hardware Test. Result: 4HDD/11/40000000: SATA(0,0).  Then repaired Disk and Permissions. Result: Volume appears to be okay.  But during use, sometimes it freezes randomly and my MBP restarts with the message "Your computer restarted because of a problem." Then "You shut down your computer because of a problem."  I also got the no entry sign a few times in the past 2-3 days. But like I said, the disk repairs have no problem. So is the disk corrupt or not or is it the cable?

I had a similar issue with the Fusion Drive on my iMac - corresponding to the freezes were log entries for I/O-errors. AHT reported no problems. Look into the Console `/Applications/Utilities/Console.app` and try to narrow the timeframe to the last freeze and post the entries found there. <comment261079> Also: what does "no entry sign" mean? Where did that message appear? <comment261167> @J.C. http://imgur.com/9BcHk0W This was the no-entry sign that popped up several times when I restarted my mbp. I had to shut down and boot until it works or boot in Recovery mode to repair disk and then it would log in.
