Is there a hashtag on the English wireless keyboard? <body> I have a wireless keyboard and can't find the hashtag. I have found it on my iPhone but can't find it on the mac keyboard  <answer237824> If  Shift 3 doesn't produce #, then try Option/alt 3.  Another less likely possibility is the \ key at the far right.  It all depends on which layout (US/ABC, British, British PC) you have active in system prefs/keyboard/input sources.  Change it to the one that matches the printing on your hardware.  <comment291502> I have just found my answer in another message, Alt 3 gives the # that i have been looking for for a long time <comment291527> pleas provide a link to that question or answer (note we don't have messages here)
