Early 2015 MacBook Pro battery not charging <body> My MacBook Pro battery is not charging for days. It only stops at 8% (not increase or decrease) when I plug in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/05PZB.png" alt="enter image description here"  In addition, the light at the end of charger does not turn on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0Gl9.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is the problem of it? How to fix it?  The detail of my MacBook Pro is as follows: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YP1lo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer285688> The lack of a charging indicator light is not a good sign, as it implies a hardware problem of some sort (i.e. cable, charger and/or MBP).  However, one thing you could do is reset the System Management Controller (SMC) to see if that resolves the issue.  ol liShut down your Mac/li liUnplug the power cable from your Mac/li liFor 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the kbdshift/kbdkbdcontrol/kbdkbdoption/kbd keys (on the strongleft/strong side of the strongbuilt-in/strong keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liAfter 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button /li liPlug in the power cable/li liTurn your Mac back on with the power button./li /ol  If the problem still persists after doing this, an easy test to do is to see what happens if you use another charger/cable. If the problem still persists with another charger/cable, then you really should run Apple Diagnostics (you can also run diagnostics in the meantime if you haven't got access to another charger/cable).  strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong  Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  <comment360358> What is your MacBook Pro version? Update your question with more details in order for other people to help you. <comment360365> Have you tried a different charger?  Have you tried an [SMC Reset](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295)? <comment360367> I haven't. I will try this and tell you the result. Thank you! <comment360370> Once you have determined that your charger works (you can try your charger on a different Mac, too) see this [answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/245547/119271) <comment360373> Does the light charging indicator turns on when charging from 0% to 8% ? <comment360374> Thanks for your great answer. I had tired your solutions, the following are results: 1) Rest SME, failed at step 3. After pressing 'shift-control-option' & 'power button' simultaneously, there is no response (dark screen); 2) Run Apple Diagnostics. At step 3, it said '! Connect the power adapter to run Apple Diagnostics', but my adapter are connected. 3) Haven't tried another charger, since it's too late in our region. <comment360375> No. I charged my battery when the battery was used to 8%. <comment360377> It is quite strange. After I unplugged the power cable from your Mac for about 20 mins, then I plugged in again. It works back to normal. And the light turns on. Don't know why? Very baffling. <comment360378> Resetting the SMC _may_ have resolved it. The _no response dark screen_ you refer to isn't a problem as your Mac was switched off. You'll have to monitor it for a day or so to see if the issue is resolved or not. Good luck! <comment360379> You are right. Thanks a lot.
