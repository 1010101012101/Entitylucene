How do I find out if my MacBook Pro supports virtual extensions? <body> I am curious to know if it's possible to use my MacBook Pro as virtual host to test application in different OS environments. I guess it would improve performance of applications running on virtual OS .  <answer276218> Yes, All recent Macs support virtualization.  Apple released native hypervisor functionality with their OS X Yosemite release, their Hypervisor.framework.  What this does is it allows you to run a VM natively on OS X, without the need for client hypervisor (such as VMware Fusion or VirtualBox).  Source  <answer276221> There are a handful of Intel processor extensions that indicate easy virtualization (VMX / APIC) - but anyone could write a virtualization engine on code alone with enough smarts, budget, engineering so just because a specific extension is lacking, you can't virtualize.  That being said - you'll be hard pressed to find a Mac running OS X (now macOS) that doesn't have VMX or better:  ul lihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization  codesysctl machdep.cpu.features/code/li /ul  <comment347577> I'm pretty sure all Macs support virtualization and don't require any configuration to do so. <comment347581> Does Mac support kernel based virtual machines ? <comment347583> Can't cite an "official" answer, but seeing as I can virtualize a whole lot using Parallels Desktop on my MacBook Air with decent performance, it *has* to have hardware or firmware support.  The days of viable pure-software virtualization are far behind us. <comment347589> I will give it a try to veertu <comment347593> Could you please add relevant sections from your source to the body if possible? It makes it easier to read and provides security in case the link dies. <comment347598> Thanks for your answer. As per @JMY1000 's comment, please provide at least a brief summary of the Source. Over time links break and then anyone else looking at your answer will be stuck.
