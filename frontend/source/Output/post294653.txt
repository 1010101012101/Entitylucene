How to check individual in-app purchases as developer on iTunes Connect? <body> Is there any way to check each in-app purchases my app is receiving on iTunes Connect?  On Android for example you have a list of every purchase with an ID so if a client makes a complain I can easily check if he actually made the purchase, but on iTunes I just see statistical data, but not list of every purchase, so I can't check purchase.  My worst fear is a purchase properly charged but not registered by our servers, so the client loses its money and I can't confirm the purchase.
