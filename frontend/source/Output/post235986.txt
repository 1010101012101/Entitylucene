Create El Capitan install partition <body> I went through a lot of articles on how to create bootable os x install partition but eventually I ended up with a need of making resize of my system partition - unfortunately DiskUtility shows this option greyed out. Any ideas why? I don't want to loose my existing system installation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3iGU4.png" alt="DiskUtility window screenshot"  Properties say that it is a physical volume and it's not using CoreStorage. This is the output of diskutil list command:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPic7.png" alt="diskutil list"  And it seems like I managed to resize this disk0s2 partition with:  precodediskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 480GB /code/pre  command. Still don't get why this option is absent in DiskUtility. It used to be there. And unfortunately this is not what I was looking for. After I resized this volume DiskUtility didn't allow me to create a new partition. Therefore I think the problem is in that I didn't partition drive properly from the very beginning. diskutil splitPartition doesn't work at all - it says that it cannot unmount disk. Any ideas other than to wipe HDD contents out and install from scratch? I don't want to install Snow Leopard first and update it to El Capitan. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1pPJP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer236037> Try to return everything back:  precodediskutil resizevolume disk0s2 R /code/pre  and then:  precodediskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 480G jhfsx InstallOSX 10G /code/pre     Resizing a volume that is currently set as the computerâ€™s startup disk   will invalidate that setting; use the Startup Disk System   Preferences panel or bless (8) to reset the resized volume as the   startup disk.   <comment288758> I will try it this evening when I get to home. <comment288802> I removed the `1`! The resizeVolume (in contrary to the splitPartition) verb doesn't require a *numberofPartitions*. <comment288900> Yes, this command works fine. I managed to extract InstallESD.dmg to this partition, but it doesn't seem that it is bootable. How can I make it bootable? <comment288901> @cave-canem I have chosen recover from image to extract InstallESD to this partition. It's of hfs+ type now. But it is not bootable. <comment288947> I do not quite understand what it means to "make a bootable InstallESD" <comment289051> @cave-canem I tried to burn InstallESD.dmg manually. I think that the article that I followed is a bit errant. I managed to locate https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201372 and I think I will try it this evening.
