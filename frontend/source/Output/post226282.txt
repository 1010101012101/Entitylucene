Will windows be open after restart? <body> I restarted my MacBook and I had some important tabs open in Incognito mode. Will they still be open when I reboot?   <answer226283> So you mean browser tabs rather than application windows? strongAnswer is no/strong. That's the purpose of private mode / incognito tabs. Once closed - they are gone.  If you talk about opened programs, that is possible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/99l41.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment274777> Oh shoot, ok. Thank you, anyways.
