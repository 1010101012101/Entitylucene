App store still showing beta release of El Capitan months after withdrawal from beta programs? <body> Months after withdrawing from the beta program, following the guides for exiting, and then installing the production release of OS X 10.11 and installing 10.11 back when it was new, then restoring from a Time Machine backup prior to installing the beta release, everything was fine except app store still offers me beta releases. How can I stop this? Right now I am on OS X 10.11.2 the app store is offering me 10.11.4 beta though 10.11.3 is the current OS X version.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dwMoT.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer224825> Try following these steps, and no more beta software should ever show up in the App Store.  ol liOpen System Preferences and click App Store. /li liFind "Your Computer Is Set to Receive Pre-Release Software Update Seeds"/li liClick "Change"/li liSelect "Do Not Show Pre-Release Updates."/li /ol  emhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2990027/operating-systems/how-to-leave-the-os-x-beta-program.html/em  <answer254271> This worked for me! After unchecking the beta software enrollment in the system settings, I ran:  codesudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog/code  codeman softwareupdate/code doesn't document this flag, but it seems to clear pending updates from the App Store, and on the next run of the App Store it will repopulate based on the current configuration of your system, therefore it will not show the beta update, but it will still show other regular updates for your system.   man page: https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/softwareupdate.8.html  <comment272681> I did that, it was part of 'following instructions'. That option has not been available to me for months. <comment273507> Against my better judgement I upgraded to the beta version. I'd really like to get the App Store only notifying me of production releases. <comment273543> The 'upgrade' said the beta, 10.11.4 in the app store for me but the actual version installed was 10.11.3 , the production  upgrade. <comment316557> Welcome to Ask Different.

After opting out of the beta updates, MacOS Sierra still displayed the next beta of MacOS, but the command in the answer reset the catalog to "production" as the terminal output said.
