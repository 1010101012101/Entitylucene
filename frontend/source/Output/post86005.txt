Shortcut to eject all external hard drives but not MobileBackups <body> So far I've been using the following AppleScript to eject all external drives at once conveniently using a shortcut:  precodetell application "Finder"     eject (every disk) end tell /code/pre  This script is is stored in code/Library/Scripts/code and I have assigned a shortcut to trigger it in FastScripts.  But there's one problem. When you have strongTime Machine Backups/strong enabled, OS X mounts a virtual codeMobileBackups/code volume in code/Volumes/code to store stronglocal snapshots/strong. This volume will be ejected alongside all the physical external volumes. I want to avoid this as this will stop local snapshots from being made (until it's mounted again at next login).  h3How can I add an exception to exclude code/Volumes/MobileBackups/code in the AppleScript above?/h3  <answer86008> This AppleScript code:  precodetell application "Finder"     set diskList to the disks     repeat with mountedDisk in diskList         if name of mountedDisk is not "MobileBackups" then             eject mountedDisk         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  ejects all mounted disks except when named codeMobileBackups/code, that is, code/Volumes/MobileBackups/code.  <answer164857> I've slightly modified this to do exclusions as a set.  precodeset exceptionsList to {"MobileBackups", "startup disk", "home", "net"} tell application "Finder"     set diskList to the disks     repeat with mountedDisk in diskList         if name of mountedDisk is not in exceptionsList then             eject mountedDisk         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <answer271261> You can do the following instead:  precodetell application "Finder"   eject (every disk whose ejectable is true) end tell /code/pre  If you have partitioned disks mounted, hold down the  "Option" key, run your script, then release the key when done.
