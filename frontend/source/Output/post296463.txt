How can I turn my Mac into a typewriter? <body> A fairly niche request, I'd guess: I want to turn my old MacBook Air into a computer that runs WriteRoom (or another text editor) and strongnothing/strong else. I don't need or want any web connection--I can save files to a USB drive to transfer them, or print out pages. I don't want any other applications. I want my laptop to turn on, go to WriteRoom, and do nothing else. How close can I get to this scenario, and how should I go about doing it? I'd prefer to do it without hiding or restricting access to all the apps--I just want a stripped-down electronic typewriter.   <comment374404> They quick answer probably is "set WriteRoom as the only autostart application for a login which logs in automatically". If you are looking for something a bit more sophisticated please clarify this in your question. <comment374419> https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21985?locale=en_US
