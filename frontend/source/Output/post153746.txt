Has anyone turned off FileVault after it has completed? <body> I have a 1TB SSD in a 15" Mac Book Pro  It took about 30 hrs to Encrypt, which during, the computer was virtually unusable. It just finished with that and now it says it is optimizing with 5 DAYS!!!! remaining. I wish I never agreed to do it. Has anyone turned it off after the whole process is complete and if so how long did that take?  <answer153758> Just go to System Preferences, click on Security, then FileVault then click the button that says turn off FileVault. But if you have it on, I would recommend leaving it on. It increases your security, and may take a while to turn off (decrypt) your files, but it's your choice.  <answer181282> I have a mac mini late 2012 with 1TB hard drive. There were 875GB free when I decided to turn off filevault 2 on Yosemite. It started at 9am and was done before 8pm. I checked disk activity from the activity monitor and it said about 975GB read/write at the end and the speed varied from 40MB/s to 20 or even 10MB/s at the very end. So, it seems like regardless how much space you have used, the OS will have to go through the whole disk read and write. My reason to turn it off was that it is my work computer and I think my office mates should be able to turn it off, turn it on, and log in with their account.  I'd like to add that the OS locked my keyboard when decrypting the harddrive. Plan the job accordingly.   <answer240187> NEVER EVER TURN ON FILEVAULT....WORST THING YOU WILL EVER DO. if something goes wrong in the startup process you mac will not turn on and you will need to call support.  They will walk you through several steps and then have you turn it off.  I just spent the better part of two hours doing this.  And by the way you may lose the contents of your home directory during the decryption process..   <comment180961> Why not just leave it on? It will take a while to decrypt your files and using FileVault increases your computers security. But if you really want to go to System Preferences, Security, then click FileVault. Then click turn off FileVault. <comment180970> I am just super bummed right now because of how long this is taking and how bogged down my mac is running.  I have an important editing project to work on and everything is slow, and the optimizing is now saying 15 days to completion.  I'm even thinking of rolling back to the last time machine I did right before I installed Yosemite. I wish there was some type of warning about this when they ask you to use FileVault. <comment180986> Yeah that sounds terrible but from the looks of it all you can do now is wait. :( <comment182282> It sounds like there is something bad with your partition. On my MBP it takes approx. 1h for 750GB encryption. Try `diskutil cs list` in Terminal to see if encryption was successful. I had a similar case once where I decrypted / encrypted several times without success. Probably you should wipe your disk and reinstall. <comment199129> In my case it also took several days but with not performance impact. I did not notice any problem during the process. I have a 750 GB HD with over 500GB of data. <comment205016> I have even more ridiculous situation, Can you imagine "Optimizing 3532 days remaining", this is my way :)  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/174108/filevault-optimizing-43-days-remaining <comment295101> Welcome to Ask Different!
