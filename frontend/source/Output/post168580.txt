Sync Notes from Mac and iOS devices without iCloud <body> I did some research, and discovered that people have had nightmares with syncing notes from the Notes app via iCloud, in that all of the notes get permanently deleted. Before seeing these articles/forum posts, I had considered activating cloud sync for my notes, but given the danger, I don't think I'd like to do that.  Thus, I'm looking for an alternative solution. I have heard of OneNote, Box, and so on, but what I have not found is a way to sync one's notes from the Notes app on both Mac and iOS across some other cloud. If anyone has any ideas I would really appreciate it.  <answer259229> emNOTE: i assume in my answer that you just don't want the Apple iCloud servers/em  h3you need an other email account to do this/h3  ul liyou add one more email account (any but not iCloud)/li liand then you activate at this email account the section NOTES /li lithe notes are created in an imap folder named codenotes/code/li lido it on both: iPhone and Mac/li lithen you move all notes on Mac to the other account/li lithen you can switch off the NOTES with the iCloud account/li /ul  h3iPhone (iOS10):/h3  codeSettings/code - codeNotes/code - codeAccounts/code - em(some account)/em - codenotes/code - emswitch: on/off/em  h3OSX 10.11.6/h3  codeSettings/code - codeInternet Accounts/code - em(some account)/em - codenotes/code - emcheckbox: on/off/em  <comment197940> 'people' have issues with everything. Just read this site every day to see what they can get up to. The myriad with no issues don't post about it. <comment229871> @Tetsujin Haha, good point. There's this poem I read once that said that "there's a crack in everything [and] that's how the light gets in" or something along those lines. Perhaps this is the (or only one) crack in iCloud... but I don't see any light coming in here. Kidding. Then again, that could be a fault of people as well, but that's better said on the Philosophy forum. <comment318398> Many users are also in search of solutions without any cloud because they are working on sensitive information.
