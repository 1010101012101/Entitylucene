Photos getting deleted from favourites album <body> Will deleting the photos from my phone mean that the ones in my Favourites Album will be deleted too?  <answer213472> Yes, if you delete a photo from your Camera Roll that photo will also be deleted from all other albums, including the Favourites album.br Photos in a album is just a link to the photo in the Camera Roll.  <answer213473> Short answer: Yes. At least for iOS9.  A bit longer answer: The Favorites Album in the Photos App in iOS9 generates a link to all photos that is marked with a "heart". If you delete the photo then the link in the Favorites album also disappears.
