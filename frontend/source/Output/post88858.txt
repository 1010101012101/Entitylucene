Hard Drive Preview / Disk Utility Used Space Discrepancy? <body> So I recently cleared a lot of space off of my hard drive as a sort of "spring cleaning," and I got it down to less than 40GB, but my computer doesn't seem to agree with itself on that. If I look at the info of my hard drive on my desktop, it gives me this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fbR3A.png" alt="Hard Drive Info"  but when I look at the partition in Disk Utility, it gives me this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVnxw.png" alt="Disk Util Partition Inspection"  How do I get DiskUtil to realize how small my hard drive is?  <answer88871> Do you have Time Machine enabled? This could be a result of the Time Machine snapshots...    Have you looked at this thread here: How to fix Disk Utility, About This Mac, and Finder that disagree on hard drive space usage?  To disable Time Machine Snapshots :   Open the Terminal from Applications/Utilities Enter : sudo tmutil disablelocal Enter your password at the prompt  <comment104200> I believe that get info excludes anything that's in your bin/trash. <comment104212> I'm not sure that it's even necessary to disable Time Machine to get this space back. I think these snapshots are only kept for at most a week and will be delete if you need the disk space anyway (for example if you try to create a large file)
