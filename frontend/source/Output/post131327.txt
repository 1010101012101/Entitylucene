using iMac 2008 (display port) as external monitor with MacBook Pro 2013 (thunderbolt) <body> I am trying to connect a MacBook Pro 2013 to an iMac 2008. The latter is a 24 inch model and has no thunderbolt, just a strongMini Display Port/strong.br  Any idea how to connect the iMac to the MacBook Pro, to use as an external monitor?   <answer131331> ol liWith both the iMac and Macbook off connect the computers with a Firewire cable./li liTurn on the MacBook while holding the "T" key. This puts the MacBook into Target Mode and a firewire icon appears on the screen. From now on you only need touch the iMac Keyboard and mouse./li liTurn on iMac while holding the Option key. This allows you to choose the Start Up volume, in this case the MacBook.

Press the power key of the MacBook to turn it off.  Hope this helps  There is no way of connecting the iMac through display port or thunderbolt since it is incompatible as stated in the comments below  <answer131335> This will not work since Target display Mode is a feature only available on iMacs since 2009.   <answer131406> The previous answers are correct: You cannot have a 24" iMac used as a raw display for another Mac (per Matthieu Riegler's link to this article).  A nifty workaround might be Synergy.  It's a virtual keyboard/mouse switcher and might be a good fit, assuming your Macs are running at least 10.5.  <comment154253> It's an 24" iMac as stated in his post and it's not compatible : http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3924 <comment154255> you're right, I will edit my answer. <comment154257> Do you want to use both monitors at the sametime or only the iMac screen ? <comment154347> http://www.screenrecycler.com  A Cable-Setup is not possible, but the App should work though. <comment154533> Thanks to all for the speedy replies. It looks like the iMac won't do as a monitor...:-( Will try the Synergy suggestion though. <comment207044> Is Target display mode is the only option ? <comment207072> The other option would something like Remote Desktop, so to me : yes. <comment336532> Nice solution unfortunately in this way you're using the hardware of the iMac instead of the one of the MacBook <comment336606> You are right Nicholas, I must have read the question wrong
