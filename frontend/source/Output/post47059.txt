Accessing ~/Library in Open/Save dialogs <body> Sometimes, I want to save a file somewhere in ~/Library/. I can think of two ways to do this: either go to it in Finder and drag the folder to the dialog, or use a tool such as Default Folder to make the folder a favorite.  Is there any way to navigate to ~/Library/ within a Save dialog on Lion without using a third-party app?  <answer47061> In the Open/Save dialog, press kbd⌘/kbd kbd⇧/kbd kbdG/kbd (command + shift + G), then type "code~/Library/code" and press enter.
