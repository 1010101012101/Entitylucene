How can Growl trigger an shell script or AppleScript (NOT vice versa!) <body> When a codeGrowl/code notification gets issued I want to trigger an AppleScript. I had a look at the "Actions" in the codeGrowl/code preferences, and you can trigger things like an email or a text-to-speech call, but not an arbitrate shell script  or AppleScript.  Any idea how to do this? Does a codeGrowl/code plugin for this exists? I searched the net for it, but could only find solutions for the other way around (i.e. issuing a notification from a script).  Many thanks in advance!  <answer81056> There is currently no support in Growl for this feature, but according to this Google Groups post:     Growl 2.1 will be bringing a Script action capable of running either    shell scripts or AppleScripts.  This will be a 10.8+ feature though as    Growl 2.0+ is sandboxed, and the tool we need to run arbitrary user    scripts while under sandboxing is a 10.8+ feature.    Growl 2.1 is still in Alpha testing.  <answer146524> Growl 2.1 does support ScriptActions, but it doesn't seem to be documented anywhere but a google group thread. Below is a simple example from the thread. You create a script file with the content, place it in code~/Library/Application Scripts/com.Growl.GrowlHelperApp/code, and then set it up inside Growl as described in the same thread.  precodeusing terms from application "Growl"     on perform action with notification         ignoring case             if notification's app name is "test growl" then                 activate me                 display dialog "goodbye" with icon 1             end if         end ignoring     end perform action end using terms from /code/pre
