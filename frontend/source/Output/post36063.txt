What is the meaning of Wired Memory in OS X? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What is in wired memory?       Recently I bought a MacBook Pro Core i5 with 4GB Memory (RAM).   After using Xcode and quitting it, all of my memory is committed and I have only 100 MB of free RAM.  So I closed all of my remaining apps, but RAM usage is still high and I don't had much free memory.  What's happening? And what is the meaning of Wired in system memory?
