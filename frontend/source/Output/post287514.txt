CPU consumption alert script <body> Sometimes a website on Chrome sneaks on me, and starts consuming 100% CPU continuously. I only notice that when the fan is running full speed. Then I use the Chrome Task manager to find the culprit and shut it down. I do not want to investigate why some websites do that, just shut them down.  Question: Is there a script or something, that would alert me if: CPU usage 100% for longer than a minute.   Using the existing Chrome Task manager that already monitors CPU usage by Tab, would be nice, if I can just get an alert from it.
