How do I show keynote presentation over Airplay and remote connection with presenter notes on my laptop? <body> Macbook Pro 15" retina running Mavericks Keynote v 6.2  I need to give a presentation to a room full of folks both locally and abroad.  The room I am presenting in has a display with AirPlay.  I can play my slideshow with presenter notes with expected results - presenter notes on my laptop, presentation on the AirPlay.  The problem seems to be with any remote software I try and use to show the presentation to my colleagues abroad.  I've tried Linq, webex, hangouts, and join.me and all will show my desktop (with presenter notes) and don't seem to be able to see the extended desktop, with the presentation view.    I am very new to this - is there a known way to do accomplish this that is getting by my google-fu?
