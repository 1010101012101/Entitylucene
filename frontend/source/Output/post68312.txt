How do I make my Mac stop responding to an Apple remote? <body> I've got a MacBook running OS X 10.5 and an Apple TV sitting next to each other.  The remote for the Apple TV is being picked up by the MacBook.  I want it to only control the Apple TV.  <answer68314> OS X 10.5: Go to codeSecurity/code in codeSystem Preferences.app/code, then select codeDisable remote control infrared receiver/code at the bottom.  newer versions of OS X: Go to codeSecurity and Privacy/code in codeSystem Preferences.app/code, then click on codeAdvanced/code at the bottom and select codeDisable remote control infrared receiver/code.
