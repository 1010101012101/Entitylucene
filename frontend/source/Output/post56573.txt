How can I make Safari stop webpages from overriding any shortcuts? <body> I sometimes need to edit pages on WikiDot, but WikiDot overrides the kbdâŒƒ/kbd+kbdE/kbd shortcut (and many others), which is a emsystem-wide/em shortcut I often use due to the lack of an kbdend/kbd-key on my keyboard.  Is there a way to stop all webpages from overriding any shortcuts?  <answer68334> There are three ways to prevent this behavior on a web page.  ol liPreferred method - Use the settings on the Web App to disable or change shortcut keybindings./li liUse a third-party Safari extension that allows you to modify the keybindings for javascript./li liDisable Javascript in Safari./li /ol  <comment64971> Just a heads up, command-right and command-left are shortcuts for end and home resp. <comment64974> not really a solution, but these key parsers are Javascript based, so disable JS.  Unfortunately (or fortunately as some people will have you believe) you will probably find a lot of functionality is removed. <comment116065> Can you post any links for a Safari extension that can do this?
