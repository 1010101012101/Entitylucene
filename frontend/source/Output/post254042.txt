Keynote, numbers and pages not available on El Capitan after reinstalling <body> I had installed Windows on my MacBook Air after wiping its HDD and then decided to have OS X reinstalled. One thing I noticed is that the office software that had previously showed up in the dock wasn't installed. When I look up Pages on the Appstore it shows a 20€ price tag. How can that be?  <answer254044> If it was associated with your Apple ID before the OS X reinstallation the reason is that you are haven't logged into the Mac App Store with your Apple ID.  Go to 'Store  Sign In…' and enter your Apple ID credentials. After that you will see "Download" instead of the price for Pages.  <comment316237> If you had them installed previously, look on the Purchased tab of the App Store and see if you can download them from there. <comment316247> That's it thank you very much!
