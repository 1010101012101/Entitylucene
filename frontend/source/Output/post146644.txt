AirDrop: Bluetooth or Wi-Fi? <body> How does AirDrop work? I thought it is just Bluetooth, but I am starting to doubt that now.  Whenever I turn AirDrop on, my Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are automatically turned on. If I turn the Wi-Fi off, and try to AirDrop, emsometimes/em it works, but sometimes it doesn't. It emnever/em works if I turn the Bluetooth off instead.  So... Why does this happen? How does AirDrop work?  <answer146645> Bluetooth LE is used for local discovery of other Airdroppers and WiFi direct is used for transmitting anything of meaningful size since it has a MUCH faster xfer rate.  And here's a longer version of that explanation.  <answer146646> AirDrop uses Bluetooth to create a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi network between the devices.  Each device creates a firewall around the connection and files are sent encrypted, which actually makes it safer than transferring via email. AirDrop will automatically detect nearby supported devices, and the devices only need to be close enough to establish a good Wi-Fi connection, making it possible to share files across several rooms.  <answer148580> It uses Bluetooth to locate the Air Drop enabled device &amp; create device to device Wi-Fi link (Wi-Fi Direct) to transfer files  <answer168751> There's a way to use Airdrop without Wi-fi connection  There's a way to bring back the "Airdrop" to Finder again even that you just in Ethernet/LAN connection. Simply run the command terminal below:   precodedefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces 1  /code/pre
