Harddrive is full of Audio and Photos, how can I find them? <body> I have bought a new Macbook and when I go to About This Mac - Storage I see: 1.11 GB Audio and 750 MB of Photos.. But I have not copied any Audio or Photos to this laptop.  How can I find where these files are? For example in Windows there was this app: WinDirStat https://windirstat.info/ Anything like this for Mac?   <answer134337> How about Daisy Disk? It's a fantastically fluid and feature filled application for the cause.  However, I think the majority of the space taken up by photos are operating system/application assets  <answer134339> If you do not want to install third party software (and deal with side effects) you can use the Terminal located in your utility folder.  type codemdfind .mp3/code to find mp3 files  repeat for mp4, jpeg, PNG and so on....  <comment158985> are any of those files in your Pictures folder or Music folder? <comment158986> There are no files in those folders. <comment158987> This even finds texts in pdf files!! <comment158989> This is a great software, thanks! <comment158992> You need to use the (.)mp3 to only show files with mp3 extension.
