iPad: app stops when screen is locked <body> Basically I have a problem with apps stopping when the screen is locked. I have first encountered this issue when I started using Strava.   I would normally start recording on codeStrava/code, lock the screen and put the codeiPad/code into my backpack, after I finish the ride, I would unlock the screen just to find out that the app is not running.  I initially though that this is codeStrava/code specific issue, but I have since tried Endomondo and it exhibits exactly the same behavior.  Few details:  ul liIf I start the recording, then lock the screen, then unlock it within the short period of time (~ 1 minute or less) - the app is still running. Which means it does not stop immediately after the screen lock/li liIf I don't lock the screen, but just put the codeiPad/code into my backpack, the screen locks automatically in 5 minutes. In this case, no matter how long I ride, the app will keep running and will be still active when I unlock the screen. This is a workaround but not prefered solution/li /ul  I would like to know why does iPad stop apps after the screen lock and how do I change that behavior.  I am using codeiPad mini/code and codeiOS 8.2/code  UPDATE:  based on the comments and answers from other users, few more details:  ul liLocation Services are enabled for these apps and set to "Always on"/li liBackground refresh is enabled in the system and for these apps/li /ul  <answer194112> Maybe Background App Refresh is deactivated?  Go to Settings  General  Background App Refresh and check if a specific app is blocked, or if the general switch is off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aRfz6.jpg" alt="Background App Refresh iPhone"  <answer194114> Maybe Location Services are set to "While Using" for those apps?  Go to Settings  Privacy  Location Services and look for Strava.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ajbx8.jpg" alt="location services"  In my settings is set to "Always"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4T71z.jpg" alt="always, while using the app, never"  <answer225839> The worst, but working solution will be to set screen locking to 30 seconds, so that it will go to sleep faster. Looks like apple does it on purpose.  <comment231433> Unfortunately this is not the case. The background refresh was alway enabled for these apps. <comment231435> Your talking about a GPS tracking? Can you check Settings - Privacy -  Location Services and check the app? I think you might need to have the app running on the foreground then click the button to switch off the screen. I you press the home button first, the app is not active. <comment231439> @Rogier, I don't press the home button. I have the app running in FG before lokcing the screen. The app is obviously granted access to Location Services too <comment231450> No, the location services are switched to "Always"
