software for autoslicing a song <body> I'm searching a program for slicing a song (MP3, wav, whatever) automatically in different patterns.  <answer11541> I hope I understand correctly, you are trying to edit a song, perhaps for a ringtone or something ?   You could try Garageband that ships with your Mac,  Or you could try this Program, Audacity, I find it very useful. http://audacity.sourceforge.net/  Hope it helps  Karl  <comment8764> please be more explicit about the meaning of "slicing in different patterns"
