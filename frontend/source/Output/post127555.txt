How to upgrade RAM of MacBook Pro 15-inch, Mid 2012 <body> I want to upgrade my MacBook Pro 15-inch, Mid 2012. It has now 8 GB of RAM. I want to upgrade it to 16 GB.   Any suggestion on how to do this are greatly appreciated.  <answer127575> macsales.com aka OWC is a fantastic website for buying RAM. I purchased 16 gb for my late 2011 model with no problems. Order the RAM amount that you want, then when the ram arrives you must unscrew the back cover of your macbook and find the RAM to remove, which you will then replace with the RAM you bought. I highly suggest watching a YouTube video on the correct procedure to do this, as it is virtually impossible to describe the process in words. Search on YouTube: installing RAM MacBook Pro. Good luck!   <answer257257> Instructions directly from the Apple Support Site (link):     strongStep 1: Remove the bottom case/strong      ol   liShut down your MacBook Pro.

If you prefer a more visual approach, this YouTube video (one of many I found) also shows how to perform the upgrade on a non-Retina MacBook Pro (mid-2012).  <comment149473> I've removed the shopping recommendation part of the question, see the [FAQ] for why such questions are usually off-topic. <comment149476> is this a retina or non retina model? The non-retina model can be upgraded to 16GB, the retina model cannot be upgraded at all. <comment149481> Even though some say that your computer can only be upgraded to a certain amount of RAM, many have found that it can be upgraded to 16 gigabytes with no problems, as I did with my computer. <comment149505> non-retina model
