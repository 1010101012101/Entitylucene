Restoring original photo size after exporting from Apple Photos <body> I exported a number of important photos to a back up hard drive and then removed them from Apple Photos as they were not regularly needed.  When I then opened up the photo from the HD it was substantially reduced in size. I tried importing them back to Photos but it remained smaller in size than the original.  How do I restore the original size of these photos?  <comment341189> You probably don't, unless you have an actual backup - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188510/how-to-export-photos-from-the-new-photos-app-in-full-quality?rq=1 which is probably related
