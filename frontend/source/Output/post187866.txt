Shuffle by album on iOS-devices? <body> In iTunes and on iPods (excluding the most recent Nano) there is an option to playback a playlist shuffled by album. This option does not exist in "Music.app" on iOS-devices. However, since you can play a playlist in order I was thinking that it would be possible to emulate the shuffle by album-behaviour if you somehow managed to sort the playlist in a random by album order and then just play it from the first track with shuffle disabled. This raises two questions:  ol liWhat determines the sorting order for a playlist on an iOS-device?/li liCan you somehow (maybe with an Applescript) sort a playlist in iTunes in a shuffle by album order?/li /ol
