"Recent items" menu in Finder suddenly starts showing duplicates <body> I am on OS X 10.11. Today, suddenly, the recent apps in my "Recent items" menu in Finder started showing duplicates: in other words, if I recently opened Google Chrome (for example), and then open it again, I get two entries for Chrome. And the same with every other app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UNsuG.jpg" alt="Screenshot"  What's going on?
