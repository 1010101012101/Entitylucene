Inbox emptied but system information still shows mail occupies space <body> It was time to clear out space on my Macbook Air Laptop OSX 10.12. I saw via      About This Mac  System Information   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvaZz.png" alt="enter image description here"  that Mail folder has about 25GB of stuff in it. I looked around for ways to clean it up. Thus deleted every piece of mail from my mailboxes including inbox, sent and drafts folder. Then also clicked on      Empty Deleted Items   to ensure nothing else remains.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j5K8B.png" alt="enter image description here"  Still,System information shows there is the same amount about 25GB of mail left. How can I clear that up?  Thanks.
