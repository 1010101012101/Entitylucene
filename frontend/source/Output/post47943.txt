Configuring @me.com account on Adium <body> I am trying to set up my iCloud (@me.com) account in Adium. But it never logs in, and it says that my password is wrong. However when I set it up in iChat it works fine.  I have googled for this sort of problem a bit, but found no answer.  Why is it happening?  <answer47979> Officially you cannot use third party clients for connecting to AIM with iCloud account. It seems that the protocol is the same, but authentication is different.     AOL/Apple changed the authentication method for new iCloud accounts. This will have to be fixed in libpurple before it'll work again in Adium.   This quote is from this board.  Try using a nightly build of Adium, if it's fixed â€” it's there.  <comment54919> We need more information. Does it keep asking you for your password when setting it up? Randomly? <comment54940> It won't even log in. It says the password is wrong. It works on iChat though.
