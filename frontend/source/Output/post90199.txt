Change Keyboard Layout on Lock Screen <body> I've been struggling with the following problem:  I am writing something in German during the day, therefore I change my keyboard layout to their QWERTZ style. When I lock the screen or close my MBP it somehow locks the keyboard style as well.  When I come back and try to type my password, no success. My password has a certain special symbol that cannot be typed on the US keyboard using German layout.  I try the shortcut to change layout and nothing happens. At the top of the screen I can't see the flags either.  Is there a way to change keyboard layout on the Lock Screen?  Everytime this happens I have to reset the computer using the power button, which is bad to my open applications.  <answer90200> Go to System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups.  Click Login Options. Check the box next to strongShow Input menu in login window/strong  You will then see a keyboard icon when your screen is locked.  Command + Click the keyboard icon should allow you to change the input.  <comment105860> Worked like a charm. Thank you!
