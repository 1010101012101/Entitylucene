How can I sync a particular music folder to iPhone? <body> I want to sync the music folder on my system with iPhone. The folder does not contain any sub folders and only contains mp3 files. I want my iPhone music library to get synced with this particular folder like if I add/delete any song the change should be reflected on my iPhone when I sync it.  <answer235218> That sounds like an ideal task for iTunes &amp; a single Playlist sync.  ul liLaunch iTunes, connect iPhone then select it from the top menu  /li liClick Music in the Settings section, not 'On my Device'/li liSet 'Selected Playlists...'/li liChoose a single playlist to sync./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iTUFR.png" alt="enter image description here"
