Assigning external button for mouse click on separate keyboard <body> I’m trying to assign an external button through USB to click the mouse. Is there a program on the Mac that can assign this. I am aware of switch control but not sure if it’s relevant.  I have RSI injury in my hands so I move the mouse with my foot but the mouse click is the hard part. I have an old keyboard sitting here I’m wondering if I can hook up the old keyboard put it on the floor and just hit the space bar when I want to  mouse click.  Now the tricky part I don't necessarily need the laptop keyboard because I use voice recognition software for typing but if I set up the old keyboard on the floor as a keyboard it will take over the role as the keyboard.  If there was a way to assign the floor keyboard to appear as a button instead of a keyboard then I could use both keyboards. I just don't want voice recognition software to mouse click when I SAY hit the space bar  <comment247513> Which kind of keyboards do you have? Two Apple keyboards? USB or Bluetooth?
