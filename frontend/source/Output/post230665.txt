I can't delete in tmux <body> I have searched around and the closes thing I could find to my issue is this:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23848061/cannot-get-delete-key-to-work-with-tmux-and-osx  I am running OSX and I am using iTerm2.  When I go into a tmux session my delete key does not work. I also try to use Ctrl+H and Ctrl+?, which those are not doing anything for me.  In iTerm preferences-keys, I have delete sent to ^H. In preferences-profiles-keys, I also have the box checked, Delete key send ^H.  Vim is able to delete in tmux but from the command line I can not.  h2.tmux.conf/h2  precode# Set default term set -g default-terminal "xterm"  # remap prefix to Control + a set -g prefix C-a unbind C-b bind C-a send-prefix  # force a reload of the config file unbind r bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf  # Start number at 1 set -g base-index 1  # UTF-8 set-option -g status-utf8 on  # supposedly fixes pausing in vim set -s escape-time 1  # set default terminal set -g default-terminal "xterm-color256"  # Vi copypaste mode set-window-option -g mode-keys vi bind-key -t vi-copy 'v' begin-selection bind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection bind p paste-buffer  unbind % unbind '"' unbind [ bind | split-window -h bind - split-window -v bind ^C-s copy-mode set-option -g default-shell /bin/zsh setw -g history-limit 10000  #quick pane cycling unbind ^A bind ^A select-pane -t :.+  # Clear pane bind C-l send-keys -R \; clear-history  # add airline to tmux status bar if shell "test -f ~/.tmuxlinesnapshot" "source ~/.tmuxlinesnapshot" /code/pre  Any help would be much appreciated!  <answer231325> Tmux uses code^?/code for delete. stty was not sending code^?/code.   I changed that using codestty erase '^?'/code and then changed my preferences in iTerm2 for delete to send code^?/code  https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/335
