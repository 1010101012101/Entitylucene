Changing application icon in Dock <body> I've changed the icon of an app I'm using to fit in more with the style of everything else by replacing the .icns file in the codeContents/Resources/code folder. After a restart, the cache cleared an the Dock icon changed.  However, whenever I actually start the app, the icon reverts to its old self. Then when I close the app again, it's back to what I want it to be.  Does anyone know what might be causing this? Is there another cache out there that I need to clear? Or is this something the app is actively triggering?  <comment130961> It's a custom Qt app some guy wrote, and I seriously doubt that it's actively changing the Dock icon, given the fact that the icon is reverting back to the old/original 'inactive mode' icon. There'd be no point to do that actively for esthetical reasons in any case.
