Migrating from Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS) to OS X (dev environment) <body> I'm about to migrate from Linux to OS X and I wonder if will encounter issues with development, as I probably will need lots of packages which are available in apt, yum package management systems. How can I find out whether these packages are available for OS X as well?  <answer181338> There’s a third-party package manager called Homebrew, which is in fairly common use in the Mac development community. It’s very similar to apt or yum on Linux systems, and will have a lot of the same packages.  The easiest way to find out if a package is available is to Google for “brew &lt;package name” (as codebrew install/code is the installation command, not codehomebrew install/code), or to look through a list of Homebrew formulas like http://brewformulas.org.  <comment215634> OS X has a package manager called [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). If you’re worried about whether a package will be available, probably best to start by seeing whether 1) it’s built-in, or 2) a Homebrew version is available. <comment215636> Are ther available or is it possible to install epoll/libevent ? <comment215637> @skzd Both of those are there. <comment215641> @alexwlchan Feel free to post this as an answer :-) <comment215642> I've edited your question to focus on one aspect, as multi-layered questions don't work very well here. Feel free to ask the other aspects in additional questions, but please consult the [FAQ] first to avoid overly broad questions.
