How to swap between apps and system panes using just keyboard <body> I've already known that how to swap between windows of the same app using &lt;cmd&gt; + &lt;`&gt;, swap between different apps using &lt;cmd&gt; + &lt;tab&gt;, but  How can I swap between, for example, "Safari" and the window after clicking "About This Mac"?  Okey, I the problem I met is that when swapping from "About This Mac" tab to "Safari", &lt;cmd&gt; + &lt;tab&gt; works just fine, but it don't work the contrary way, which I means from "Safari" to "About This Mac". I just want to do this by keyboard.
