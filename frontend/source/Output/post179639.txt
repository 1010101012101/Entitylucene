Bright Pixels on MacBook Pro Retina <body> I was on a normal day, doing my thing when I noticed a pile of dust on my screen. So I did what most people would do, I grabbed a clean microfiber cloth, took another embarely/em damp microfiber cloth and carefully cleaned the area on my MacBook Pro, once I was satisfied, I went back to using my computer and instantly I noticed a bright 'line' on my screen. In the picture it looks small but it is very obtrusive. I have tried running those pixel-fixing videos, I've tried to do the 'eraser' thing but the pixel, works fine, it's just very bright in that area. Have I messed up my Mac's display? I've this since Late November 2012 and I never purchased Apple Care. Thanks for your help in advance  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DsOWK.jpg" alt="Image"  *Notice the bright spot on the right (looks insignificant in the picture)  <comment213035> Tapping the screen with a microfiber cloth or rounded object (sharpie cap) will make it good, then the bright spot will fade back in <comment213038> I'm guessing these are pressure marks, I hope this isn't permanent <comment213063> Unless you rubbed the screen coating off [been there, done that, many many years ago] - what's it look like with the screen off & tilted to catch the light? Can you still see the mark? <comment213064> To clarify - are we talking this large vague stripe http://i.imgur.com/eabIVuT.png or the tiny bright spot http://i.imgur.com/JQyNiLZ.png ? <comment213118> @Tetsujin The "tiny bright spot" the stripes just show up when taking a picture <comment213120> OK, then I'd check what the screen looks like when it's off <comment213121> @Tetsujin When the screen is off, you can't see the spot at all. You also can't see it when anything black is over the spot <comment213124> then I'd look at the many pixel-massaging techniques on Google to re-flow the LCD <comment213126> I'm at WikiHow, I'lll see if those will help
