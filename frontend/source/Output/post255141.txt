App Store on my Mac not working <body> The App Store on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015), isn't working. It keeps loading, but does nothing.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHyHP.png" alt="Screenshot of the App Store"  Does anyone else has this problem? I can't find the solution on the interwebz. Can't be the only one with this problem!  And the thing is, I can't really update my Mac, because I can't enter the App Store. If I even need an update.  <comment317696> What version of macOS? <comment317698> @tubedogg it's running version 10.11.3! <comment317821> Have you tried logging out of the app store and logging back in again? <comment318093> Here's how to update from the command line: http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/13/install-mac-os-x-software-updates-terminal/
