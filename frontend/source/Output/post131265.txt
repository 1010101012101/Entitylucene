Keychain: ask for certificate from command line <body> Is it possible to ask for certificate (.certificateRequest file) from command line?  I want to mimic behavior like Keychain - Certificate Assistant - Request for Certificate in Certificate Buro from command line.  Good tool code/usr/bin/security/code does not provide requests to Certificate Buro. Maybe I wrong here.  Could anybody help with it?  <answer131275> Use the supplied "certtool" program. The "r" option allows you to generate a new certificate signing request (CSR).  <comment154262> thanks! how to specify email and display name like [here](http://monosnap.com/image/m8AcWQxc77Uwazxo5mo5GX3k0jeqPv) <comment154264> When you run the command, it will run you through a series of questions where you can enter for example the common name, email, country, etc. Please mark the question as answered, if this solves your problem. <comment154273> so, I can't use it as a part of sciprt? <comment154306> Sure, but you will have to feed those answers to the script via its stdin. You could use for example the program "expect" to do that in a neat way.
