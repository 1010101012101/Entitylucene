How to restore default system files? <body> Does anyone have the default SArtFile.bin (path: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SArtFile.bin) for Mavericks 10.9.5?  I was tinkering around with the file listed above but forgot to  back it up.br Does anyone know how I can restore the file to its original form so I can undo my changes, or how to restore default system files?  <answer219284> updating &amp; re-installation OS X without formating is keep your files. It's not a windows where all your file puts in to Windows.old and later you need go for folders take them from there.   <answer219547> Basically you have three places where you can get the original system files (except backups):  ul liRecovery HD/li liCombo update installer/li lithe (Mac) OS X installer/li /ul  hr  The Recovery HD is a basic OS X system only and just contains a subset of the files of the full system. Some files may even be outdated or different compared to the files of the full system. To mount the Recovery HD enter codediskutil mount Recovery\ HD/code in Terminal. To get access to the system files mount emBaseSystem.dmg/em:  precodehdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg /code/pre  To copy a file enter:  precodesudo cp /Volumes/Mac\ OS\ X\ Base\ System/path/to/file /path/to/file /code/pre  in your example:  precodesudo cp /Volumes/Mac\ OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SArtFile.bin /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SArtFile.bin /code/pre  hr  The Combo update installer may contain the file in question. Like the Recovery HD it only contains a subset of files of the full OS X system. To extract and install the original file, download Pacifist and open the installer package. Search for the file in question and install it. You need admin privileges to do that.  hr  If the file isn't available in the Recovery HD or the Combo installer you have to download the newest OS X installer (in your case emInstall OS X Mavericks/em (10.9.5)). The approach is similar to the Combo updater method. Right-click emInstall OS X Mavericks/em - Show Contents, navigate to /Contents/SharedSupport and mount the InstallESD.dmg. Open the folder emPackages/em in the mounted image and then the file emOSInstall.mpkg/em with Pacifist. Search for the file in question and install it. You need admin privileges to do that.  hr  In your case you are lucky because the file emSArtFile.bin/em can be found in the Recovery HD. So use the method outlined above to recover the file.  <comment195710> reinstall the combo update of the OS - also which ones there are several - i.e. you should give the app they are ion <comment195800> I don't want to reinstall OS X. I only want the actual files. Thanks. <comment195801> reinstall is the easiest way <comment196153> how do you reinstall the combo update without losing files? <comment196163> The update will only change the OSs files which you should not have changed - if you have then you need to know how to get them back before you do - i.e. you should be proficient in Unix first - that will include knowing how to restore you backups <comment196525> I reinstalled the combo update. It didn't fix the problem :( <comment196529> What are the full paths of those files? <comment196541> The paths to these files are: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ArtFile.bin
