Missing space on Fusion Drive (partition problem) <body> I know this or similar problems have been discussed, but (to be honest) I can't see the trees for the wood.  I tried to create a partition on my fusion drive (1TB Hd + 240 MB SSD). No partition was created but afterwards the capacity of my (1.2 TB) drive had been reduced to 617 GB. With 414 GB in use, approximately 400 GB of disk space is missing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a8qjv.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7jac.png" alt="enter image description here"  Terminal diskutil list says:   precodediskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage myLogicalVolGroup       999.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.1 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage myLogicalVolGroup       239.7 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3 /dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS HD IMac 1              +616.6 GB   disk2                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2                                  7EE2FE6D-3D37-46AA-B948-52243490F324                                  Unencrypted Fusion Drive /code/pre  and:   precodediskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 53DFB831-BFCA-4552-A8F5-387F3905003A     =========================================================     Name:         myLogicalVolGroup     Status:       Online     Size:         1239058563072 B (1.2 TB)     Free Space:   615951769600 B (616.0 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume A1418DDB-CB43-493F-9341-F23AE2FA7150     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     999345127424 B (999.3 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 2E45A45F-D1C1-4B62-97FA-5223DD9C965E     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     239713435648 B (239.7 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family E3B8F7DC-C327-44A7-8BE2-2BFD2AE646EB         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         None         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 7EE2FE6D-3D37-46AA-B948-52243490F324             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          616601616384 B (616.6 GB)             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               HD IMac 1             Volume Name:           HD IMac 1             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS             LVG Type:              Fusion, Sparse /code/pre  Would this simply be a matter of:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack 7EE2FE6D-3D37-46AA-B948-52243490F324 0g  (?) /code/pre  Hope some-one can help me with this.  <answer229504> Starting with OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) you'd have to enter a distinctive ( 0) size to execute the resizeStack command. The magical code... 0g/code doesn't work anymore.  strongBut/strong in your case the coderesizeStack/code option is the wrong one because your Logical Volume Group already occupies almost all available space on the Fusion Drive:  Total disk space: 1240 GBbr LVG size:             1239 GBbr PV1 + PV2 size:   1239 GBbr LV size:                  616 GB  The resizeStack option is appropriate if you want to resize the LVG and all subsequent Core Storage items (like the LV, PV and LVF).  Here you just have to expand your Logical Volume to completely fill the LVG with the following command:  precodediskutil cs resizeVolume lvUUID size /code/pre  In your case that is:  precodediskutil cs resizeVolume 7EE2FE6D-3D37-46AA-B948-52243490F324 1239g /code/pre  If you get an error (not enough space...) choose a slightly smaller size like 1238g.  hr  After further investigations one have to state that the Fusion Drive is corrupted:  Boot to Internet Recovery Mode, destroy the LVG, rebuild the Fusion Drive and restore your Time Machine backup: here is a how-to. Start with strong'Rebuild Fusion Drive' (recommended if you have a Time Machine backup)/strong.  <answer229638> If all else fails, I do it like this. I booted in recovery mode and did what you suggested:   precodediskutil cs resizeVolume 7EE2FE6D-3D37-46AA-B948-52243490F324 1239g The Core Storage Logical Volume UUID is 7EE2FE6D-3D37-46AA-B948-52243490F324 Started CoreStorage operation Error: -69674: The provided Core Storage logical volume has an incorrect size; you should run whole-disk repair /code/pre  So that was no good.

I spite of all the rules I say "Thanks for your efforts so far @klanomath"  <answer231784> Had the exact same situation. With the same error messages when trying to resize or repair the volume. None of the Disk Utility suggestions worked. In the end, followed the link provided by klanomath to rebuild the Fusion drive and restored from Time Machine backup. Back up and running in under an hour with the free disk space reclaimed.   This seems it's the only solution, on El Capitan.  <comment280140> I'm messing things up.

(y/N) Question: would that “destroy” not only data, but also my “fusion” drive? <comment280292> @RPPeters Just use "Schijhulpprogramma" to repair your disk. Choose the Fusion Drive and hit "Repair" ("Schijf-HBDO"?). But I don't think anything will be repaired. <comment280295> No, nothing repaired. Still 400 Gb missing. <comment280297> @RPPeters How did this (the unallocated LVG space) happen at all? Did you try to create a second Logical Volume or install Boot Camp? <comment280298> I tried to add a partition (with Schijfhulpprogramma), but after an hour or so of rattling hard drive, I restarted my iMac..... <comment280299> @RPPeters That's an important hint. If you try to add a partition all the files and folders which would reside in the future partition have to be moved to lower block numbers - which may take a while. Do you have a Time Machine backup? <comment280300> Yes, I have a Time Machine backup. <comment280303> @RPPeters Updated answer with a link to an earlier similar question/answer... <comment280307> Please know I am a half-wit. What precisely do you mean with "destroy the LVG"? And would it be ok to boot from an external hard drive (which is a lot quicker). <comment280309> @RPPeters This is described in the How-To. <comment280311> So it's the section starting with "'Rebuild Fusion Drive' (recommended if you have a Time Machine backup)" ? Just to be absolutely sure.... <comment280312> @RPPeters Yes, but detach your backup drive before booting to Internet Recovery Mode. After rebuilding your Fusion Drive you may attach it again <comment280313> Ok, I'll give it a go.... And: Th....s <comment280434> Ok. Thanks to @klanomath (definitely NOT thanks to Apple), my Fusion drive has been restored to its former glory. 823 GB available instead of 202 GB. Apple used to be foolproof, but those days are long gone.  Remains the question: Can I make a new partition on my Fusion drive? (To make a Mavericks bootable partition, as El Capitan and Adobe InDesign CS 6 aren’t particularly good friends, to say the least.) I don’t think it’s possible. Or is it…..? <comment280458> @RPPeters Sure! It's no problem to create a new partition. Either by shrinking the LVG and adding a new classical partition or by shrinking the LV and adding a new LV. But please ask a new question.
