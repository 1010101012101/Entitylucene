How to know when phone was last rebooted? <body> Occasionally I get the message about TouchID needing my password after reboot. Problem is, I haven't been rebooting. So I'm concerned my phone is rebooting itself in my pocket without me knowing it. I want to know for sure if my phone is rebooting by itself, or if the TouchID message is just erroneous. How can I find out if my phone is rebooting?  iPhone 5s, iOS 8 (latest)  <answer172023> There appears to be an app called "System Status Lite" that is capable of displaying the system uptime (which should be the time since the last reboot). I haven't used it myself, so I can't speak to its accuracy, but here's a store link.  <comment202454> sometimes just resetting off/on the cellular would fix that <comment202510> Works. Good find. Seems accurate.
