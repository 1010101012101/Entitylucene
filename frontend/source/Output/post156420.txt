My MacBook Pro recently stopped responding to my hdmi adapter and cable <body> One day my Mac just stopped working when I connected it to my TV using an adapter and HDMI cable.br Every time I plug in the HDMI and turn the TV to those settings both my TV and Mac screen go black. I can see my cursor on my Mac screen but it is very small. I can only then do a forced shutdown and restart my computer.br I at first thought it must be my HDMI adapter, but I just got a new one and the same thing happens.br I have all my updates and none of my settings have changed that I know of.  <comment183891> does your TV shows up in displays ? the cursor size change indicates there is a connection! <comment183892> I can't do anything on my computer once I select on the TV to be in the HDMI setting. Normally I used to be able to see the TV in the display settings, but now I can't do anything but move the cursor around on my computer screen. <comment183894> sorry, I missed that, so your computer just locks up! try repairing the permissions in Disk utility - just in case. Also try restart in Safe mode, that sometimes fixes some issues. <comment183909> Where is Disk Utility located? And is restarting it in safe mode just going and selecting to restart the computer? <comment183911> Disk Utility is in your Utility folder. Starting in Safe mode will start with minimal apple only drivers. Then restart again in normal mode. Sometimes that fixes some minor issues. <comment184121> You start in safe mode by holding the Shift key as soon as you hear the chimes & continue to hold it until you see the Apple logo. This may take longer than a normal boot.
