Can I make fn + caps lock enable caps lock when caps lock is mapped to control? <body> I know that I can remap caps lock to control. However, I occasionally wish that I still had a way to use caps lock.  After mapping caps lock to control, is there a way to temporarily reenable caps lock (perhaps via kbdfn/kbd + kbdcaps lock/kbd)? I would prefer to emnot/em have to map a different modifier key to caps lock.  <comment364762> I'm remapping to escape and I have the same question!
