MBP Boot Camp Windows 8 brightness issue <body> I am unable to get full screen brightness on my 13" MacBook Pro when booted to Windows 8 Professional. As a result, I can't use my machine outside unless I'm booted to OS X. I checked all the power settings in Windows and everything's already set to 100%.

Not a proper solution but i found a way around the problem. Set What to do when the lid closes option to Do Nothing for both 'On battery' and 'Plugged in' in power option. When you turn on your computer, close the lid and open it again and you will find keyboard shortcuts for screen brightness function after doing that. You can try this if the adaptive brightness setting does't do a thing for you.  <answer226146> Tried Both methods at the same time and it has seemed to resolve the issue, However when i was in the change advanced power settings I changed the DIM Display section to 100% and just made sure all the display section options were at their highest possible brightness.  Issues resolved Cheers lads.  <comment241226> This is also an identical issue and process in Windows 10
