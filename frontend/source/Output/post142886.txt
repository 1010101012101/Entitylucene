Prevent automatically appending file extension when renaming file <body> I originally have a file called codeconfig.yml/code. When I go into Finder and change its name to codeconfig.yml.old/code, it appears to have changed the extension. However, opening the file in TextWrangler reveals that Mac has just appended a "hidden" code.yml/code at the end, causing the filename to be codeconfig.yml.old.yml/code.  Right now, the only way I can append an extension is by going to Terminal and running codemv path/to/config.yml path/to/config.yml.old/code. Is there actually a way to use the GUI to do this?  <answer142887> ol liGo to Finder/li liopen Finder Preferences/li liUncheck "Show warning before changing an extension"/li /ol  Optionally, check "Show all filename extensions" to verify that Mac did not automatically append extensions when you add your own.
