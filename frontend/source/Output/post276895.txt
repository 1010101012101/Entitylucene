Events are off by one hour after creator entered DST <body> I'm working in in a timezone without DST shifts, while my colleague works in a timezone with DST. We have a daily meeting that is setup by my colleague in the corporate Exchange calendar (not sure what version it is, looks like 2014 or later) and I have this event in my Apple calendar.  All went fine until recently. After they switched to DST, our daily event is shown in Apple calendar one hour later than it should be.  This far I've tried:  ul liturn on timezone support in apple calendar/li liturn off timezone support in apple calendar/li lichange my timezone in Exchange web-interface to event creators timezone/li lichange my timezone in Exchange web-interface to my actual timezone/li lidifferent combinations of timezone support and exchange timezone/li lichanging exchange timezone and forcing apple calendar to re-sync as described on apple forums/li /ul  None helped. When I changed timezone in Exchange to my actual timezone and opened, the event was shown in Exchange web-interface as it should be (at X o'clock on dates before DST shift and X-1 on dates after the shift). When I changed timezone in Exchange to event creators timezone, the event was also shown as should be (Y o'clock both before and after the shift)  But no matter what I do, Apple calendar shows event 1 hour later.  More info:  ul liI run Sierra 10.12.3 (updated recently, issue was present in 10.12.2 as well)/li liMy mac is set to my actual timezone and shows correct time/li /ul  If any other details are needed, I'll add.  strongUPD:/strong tried forwarding event to myself from exchange web-interface: time for forwarded event was correct, but it was a separate event with name starting with "FWD: ", and though I pressed "Forward series", only one event was added to apple calendar.  <comment349359> Problem was solved by deleting old event and creating new one, but I think many will still appreciate a working solution
