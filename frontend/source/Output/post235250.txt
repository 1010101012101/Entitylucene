Can the Show/Hide timing of the menu bar be adjusted? <body> When using a strongbrowser/strong with multiple opened strongtabs/strong in strongfull screen/strong mode, the menu bar is constantly blocking my access to the tabs, because my gesture to the tabs area bounces off the top of the screen triggering the Show/Hide behavior. Its harshing my browsing!  The only setting I see is in preferences.  codeSystem Preferences &gt; General --&gt; Automatically show and hide the menu bar/code  Is there a preference file I can edit to change this setting?
