find -printf work around <body> I'm trying to use a script to call compare file size. Unfortunately the version of codefind/code on my mac does not support the code-printf/code switch. Any suggestions?  <answer170046> You should consider install GNU find using homebrew.   To install homebrew you just need to type the following in your terminal:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  Then install codefindutils/code by typing:  precodebrew install findutils /code/pre  Then your codefind/code version will support the code-printf/code and should be the latest:  precode$ find --version find (GNU findutils) 4.4.2 , nc.

For me homebrew prepends 'g' to the find command. <comment235212> @acornblue the "g" is for GNU
