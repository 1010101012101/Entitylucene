How can I find what is making my Mac run hotter and causing the fans to run more often? <body> My Macbook Pro's fans are running louder. I've also noticed that the average internal temperature is significantly higher. (187°F as I write this.) This didn't used to happen unless I was running full-screen video or recording multitrack audio. I've made no other changes to the computer that I can remember.   Recently, I turned on Spaces, and I thought that perhaps leaving these open was running the processor more heavily, creating more heat. But turning Spaces back off didn't help.   How can I see what background processes are running? Is there a way to track this down?   <answer40461> You can use Activity Monitor to view all the processes running on your Mac at any time. If you prefer to use the terminal, you can use emtop/em.  <answer40481> h1iStat Pro (free)/h1  ...allows you to monitor various stats about the hardware.  You can toggle between top CPU hogging and top RAM hogging processes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sy0eg.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/De8KL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer40553> While we are talking about system process monitors like Apple Activity Monitor, let me mention that Bresink's free  h2Temperature Monitor/h2  is useful to track all the various heat sensors in your system and to record graphs of readings over time. In conjunction with strongActivity Monitor/strong, strongemtop/em/strong or strongiStat Pro/strong you can observe the correlation between active processes and CPU core temperatures.  <comment45752> That did it; the Kies wifi monitor was gobbling up a gigabyte of RAM. I killed the process and the temperature went down to 117°F. Will look into how to remove it permenantly. <comment45753> Glad I could help. The wifi monitor might be [loaded at login](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/40444/11791). <comment45754> You sure that's the right link? <comment45756> Have posted a followup question on the Android site: [What happens when you kill the Samsung Kies Wifi Agent?](http://android.stackexchange.com/q/19531/1119) <comment45757> It wasn't. It's fixed now. You can skip the first paragraph of the linked answer. <comment45759> Thanks for that link; I found [another file](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3286521?start=0&tstart=0) there that's associated with Kies; I disabled that one as well. The Galaxy Tab is an awesome machine, but Samsung's Mac software isn't as good.
