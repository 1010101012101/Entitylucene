Alternative ways to switch between applications if cmd+tab doesn't work <body> What are alternative ways to switch between applications?  kbdCmd/kbd+kbdTab/kbd doesn't work for me in some games. For example on steam; "Crusader Kings II", "The Talos Principle".  So i have no ability to switch to another application like Safari when needed unless I quit the game. This is very inconvenient.   I also tried kbdCmd/kbd+ kbdH/kbd  and  kbdCmd/kbd+kbd Alt /kbd+kbdH/kbd, they do not work either.  kbdCmd/kbd+kbd Alt /kbd+kbdEsc/kbd force quits the game immediately.  <answer173439> kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd doesn't work because the game is running  in strongFull Screen/strong.   In most games you can enable emWindow Mode/em within the game's emPreferences/em and / or switch between emWindow Mode/em and emFull Screen/em with a shortcut.  As for my experience, doing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdM/kbd tends to do the trick.  <comment204051> Cmd+Tab works in most of applications (and games), that run Full Screen. But thank you for the tip. <comment204053> Cmd+M also doesn't work for me. <comment204057> @klm123 No luck with the *Preferences*, either? <comment204076> Some luck, I can play with borderless window, but menu bar makes it hard. And this is not what I want, since not all application have window mode.
