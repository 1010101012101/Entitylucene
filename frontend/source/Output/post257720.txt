Mac OS Sierra upgrade generates cgpdftoraster quit unexpectedly error printing to Cannon MG5550 <body> Since I upgraded to Mac OS Sierra, I sometimes (but not always - ie with some docs  not others) get a cgpdftoraster quit unexpectedly error when printing to Canon MG5550.  The printer is usb-connected to my 13 inch 2015 MacBook Pro.  This happens when printing pages and (some) pdf documents.   <comment321910> This seems to be a problem several Canon users are experiencing with Sierra, see https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=cgpdftoraster.
