Force add or discover a Bonjour host with known IP <body> Both client and server are running OS X 10.10.  I'm connected to a home VPN and can connect to hosts at home as long as I have their local IP addresses. Problem is iTunes doesn't allow me to enter an IP address to connect to a shared library; it uses Bonjour only, which works using multicast packets. And my VPN server doesn't forward multicast packets, so I can't connect to shared iTunes libraries.  This is frustrating because I know the IP address of the iTunes library host. I don't really understand how the client's Bonjour service works. Is there a way I can force my Mac's Bonjour service to add that as a host with the iTunes service?
