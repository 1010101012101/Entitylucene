Is there a limit for devices where I can download my purchased apps? <body> I'm thinking about renting an iPad for use. And I would like to know if I can put my password to download my apps every time I rent an iPad, or is there a limit?  <answer43064> You can download any app and other media purchased with your apple ID to a new device - as long as you authorize your new device with that apple ID.   This is what the official Apple documentation says:     Your Apple ID can have up to strong10 devices and computers (combined)/strong   associated with it. Each computer must also be authorized using the   same Apple ID. Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple   ID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID   for 90 days. You can view which devices or computers are currently   associated, remove unused devices or computers, and see how long   before they can be associated with a different Apple ID from the   Account Information page in iTunes on your computer.
