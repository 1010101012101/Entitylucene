Dropbox syncing RTF-editor for iPad with color markup possibilities <body> I'm looking for an app for iPad in which you can:  ol liSync with dropbox/li liSave and edit RTF-files/li liColor markup text (in addition to making text bold, change fontsize, et cetera)/li /ol  <answer62290> I think you're looking for something like Textastic, which can sync with Dropbox, FTP, SFTP, etc and does code highlighting for code &amp; markup and has a customizable keyboard area.  <comment42894> I am looking for the same. It would already help if there was a converter between RTF and Pages, so that I could convert my existing RTFs to .pages files on the iPhone/iPad, edit them in Pages, then convert them back to RTF and store them again in my Dropbox.
