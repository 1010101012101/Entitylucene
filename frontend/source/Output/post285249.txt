Using a 2008 iMac as monitor? <body> I currently own a 24" iMac (2008) and have been looking to upgrade. I'm going to purchase a Dell Inspiron 7567.  I was wondering instead of purchasing a monitor, if I could use my 24" iMac. I know only the 2009 and later iMacs support target control mode, but is there any way around this? The Dell has an HDMI 2.0 and the iMac has a MiniDVI and FireWire. I'm open to using dongles or software, anything that doesn't exceed $60?  <comment359763> This will not work.  You are better off buying a used monitor with that $60. <comment359771> You could struggle and see if Microsoft Remote Desktop will work as a second display.
