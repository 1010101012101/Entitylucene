Copy screenshot to Google Drive Document <body> This question is related to this one : Mac (OS X 10.9.2) no longer saving screen shots   If I use only kbdcmd/kbdkbdshift/kbd it works as expected, a new image is created on my desktop. If I only want to copy it to the clipboard in order to paste it later  into Photoshop or a Google Drive Document : I hear the sound but nothing append when I paste it (using kbdcmd/kbdkbdV/kbd) . I'm using Sierra 10.12, I'm new on macOS so that's maybe a stupid thing, the options "copy to clipboard" is checked in the system pref :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KUz1I.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any Idea how to solve it ?   <answer288049> What key combo did you use for capture to clipboard? I just tried it and it worked fine. I'm running Sierra too. I used control-shift-command-3 as my keys and then pasted into Notes. All went as expected. I had same setting in system pref keyboard as you showed. Also make sure that wherever you are pasting it accepts image files.
