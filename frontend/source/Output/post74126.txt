Is there a (working) iTunes 11 "search" shortcut? <body> The Help Topics say that Ctrl+Alt+F should go to the search field, but it don't here. I'm on Windows 7, with iTunes 11.  Is there a shortcut for the search? (I really don't like to have to use the mouse)  <answer74128> I don't have a Windows install handy to test, but the OS X version did change the shortcut from kbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdF/kbd to just kbdcommand/kbdkbdF/kbd. The equivalent Windows shortcut would likely be kbdcontrol/kbdkbdF/kbd.  <answer74355> Same problem here, but I have the answer: kbdCtrl/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdF/kbd  <comment86253> No, I tried every combination with "f" or "s". <comment86388> Hey... that works now. I thought I tried every combination with "f" last time... anyway, thanks!
