Is it possible to edit the path and view the folder path in the Finder? <body> I'm not sure what it is called on the Mac, but when I open my Downloads folder (or any other folder), I'm referring to this file explorer window that shows me my file structure.  I know there are options, like I can view my files and folders in panes, or in a detail view, etc.  But what I hate is that I can't modify the current path location easily, nor can I cut and paste the current folder path.  This really drives me nuts, I wish it could be more like Windows's file explorer as it is so easy and intuitive to use.  Is there a hidden option for these 2 issues that I am missing?  <answer63795> You can drag the icon at the top center of the window to a Terminal window and get the path.  Selecting and copying a folder or document in a Finder window also saves the path so that when you paste it in a Terminal window you get the path.  Command-click the top center icon also allows you to navigate up in the path.  <answer63796> Finder does not have a bar like in the explorer on Windows, but there are some things you can do to achieve similar results.  To have the current path always visible, open a window and go to View  Show Path Bar. This will add a bar to the bottom of your windows which shows the path of the selected file, the same as if you were in search view. You can also Command-Click on the icon at the top of the window to view the path as a menu. As noted by @lhf, copying a file will also copy its path. You can also drag a file from the window or path bar to most places where a file or path is expected, such as open or save dialogs.  To go to a folder based on its path, press kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd. This will pop up a box where you can type in a path, and either the current or a new window will open at that path. This also works in open and save dialogs.  <answer63798> Not an answer to the question per se, but I've used and beta tested (unpaid) Path Finder in the past, it provides a more intensive/technical Finder than the OS X Finder.  Some of the features that I prefer, among many:  ul liTabbed Finder/li liPath dropdowns (like Windows 7 Explorer)/li liDual panes/li liEasy access to metadata/li /ul  <answer63837> Try FinderPath  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sqFgJ.png" alt="enter image description here"     A Finder addition that displays a small address bar in Finder windows.   <comment73788> It's called a *Finder window*. <comment73839> [A similar question at Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/174297/address-bar-in-finder) <comment263779> This doesnt work on El Capitan. <comment263887> @jdln - Apple seems dead-set on ruining OS X. <comment340891> so does Path Finder allow you to edit the path? I have been using the FinderPath with regular finder, but I find that it comes nowhere near Dolphin  (linux) that I used to use. <comment340892> Works for me on Sierra. <comment359853> @dorien Did you have to do anything special to get it to work on Sierra?
