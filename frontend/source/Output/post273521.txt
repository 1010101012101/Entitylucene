How to get into Windows 10 Safe Mode on 2016 MacBook Pro? <body> I'm told I need to get into Windows 10's Safe Mode running under Boot Camp, but I'm on a Mac Book Pro, 2016 model, which does not have function keys at start up.  How can I force Safe Mode for Windows 10 on the most recent MBP?  Previous Question: Can&#39;t boot Windows 10 past loading animation under Bootcamp  <answer287355> Make a bootable USB key using the Windows Media Installation Tool (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and boot from it on your Mac.   I just finished going through this, and fixed it. It was a pain because you can't run the tool on a Mac, so you must run the tool on a spare PC. I was on vacation, and didn't have one until I got home. My Windows 10 boot up was stuck at the blue logo.  Once you re-start the Mac with the USB drive created by the tool, hold down the Option Key, and you'll see the USB option EFI Boot.    When that starts, select 'Repair your computer,' NOT 'Install Windows'  Troubleshoot  Startup Repair   That worked for me... Don't forget to keep that USB drive around :)   <comment343863> Are you able to boot normally - or is this your problem ?? <comment343864> Maybe read here: http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/start-windows-10-in-safe-mode-boot-advanced-options-f8-exit-3421988/ <comment343865> Windows 10 sits with the spinning dots, unable to get to the login screen. I don't have a USB recovery drive. <comment343873> Windows 10 will automatically drop to the internal recovery if you hard shut down 3 times at a failed boot. [I've never tried this on Boot Camp, only on actual PCs] Safe mode, btw, is Shift, not an f-key. <comment343876> Neither option works under Bootcamp. Tried hard shutdown during start up 5 times. Couldn't get it to kick into recovery.
