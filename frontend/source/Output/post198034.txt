341kb "Icon" file in my Google Drive folders? <body> I'm not sure whether to ask this here or on another Stack Exchange site.  See this screen capture:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BWOXJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  This seems to be consistent on most if not all of my Google Drive folders as seen in Finder.  Also I don't know why the file name is vertically offset like that.  But basically, I don't want it there as it seems to be getting bundled in with .zip files that I try to create... How do I remove these and stop them from getting back into my folders?
