Open a favorite web page quickly using the keyboard? <body> I have a Google spreadsheet that I open every morning  I'd like to open it quickly using just the keyboard after startup, as opposed to:  ul liopening Firefox/li ligoing to the address bar/li lityping in the tag name/li liarrowing down/li lihitting enter/li /ul  Is there a way to do this with just a few keystrokes?  Assuming I don't already have a browser running (I prefer to use Firefox if that matters)  Also, I would rather not have to use a third party app to do this  strongUPDATE:/strong  Realize that I could have FF run at startup which would save me at least one step...  strongSUMMARY:/strong  I would really like to have an experience like opening the web page from Spotlight if possible; the webloc file does show up in spotlight but it's way down the list... I'd like the first few letters to bring it to the top. Perhaps there is a way to assign priority to Spotlight items?  <answer130858> You can create shortcut to Your page somewhere on Your hard drive (drag and drop address from Your browser). Then use strongBetterTouchTool/strong http://www.boastr.de to launch this link using global keyboard shortcut.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ALSXl.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also drag this codewebloc/code file to strongDock/strong.  Edit: you can also add this codewebloc/code file to codeLoginItems/code and Your webpage will start automatically when You log in.  <answer130859> If you really want to use Spotlight to do this, in System Preferences  Spotlight you can drag and drop "Web Pages" to the top of list.  <answer130882> I use LaunchBar and it can do what you want. Assuming you have added the spreadsheet to your firefox favorites, You would just:  ol liHit kbdcommand/kbd + kbdspace/kbd/li liBegin typing the title of the page /li liHit kbdreturn/kbd once the correct favorite appears/li /ol  LaunchBar does cost and though I think it is worth the cost, there are two alternatives that are free and almost certainly will work for you: Alfred or Quicksilver  <comment153569> Safari maps `Command` + the number keys to the first 10 bookmark bar items <comment153573> Hi, thanks for the comment. I'm hoping to stick with Firefox and would also like to do this without already having a browser running (edited question for better clarity) <comment153574> Thanks for the suggestion, I noticed that I could drag it to the dock (not a bad option); would rather stay away from 3rd party apps as mentioned though <comment153579> So You need to use keyboard instead of clicking this with mouse/trackpad ? <comment153585> You can assign priority of spotlight file types in the spotlight preferences <comment153635> Hi, I tried this but the result is still way down the list. What constitutes a "web page", I have the webloc file saved on my desktop currently for testing... Thanks :) <comment153636> Thanks, so far this isn't helping move the result up the list, see my comment on **samh**'s answer <comment153637> Thanks, I don't really want to get a whole new app just to access one web page quickly, unless it's really worthwhile to use the app for other purposes that I haven't discovered a need for yet. <comment153638> All three apps are useful for quickly accessing lots of different things. I barely scratch the surface of launch bar's capabilities, but I like it for launching apps, keeping a clipboard history, and jumping quickly to websites or songs that I want to listen to. <comment153677> Hm. It turns out "web pages" are pages in Safari's history. .webloc files show up for me in Spotlight's "other" section. Your other option within Firefox would be to press Command-L and start typing. If it's saved as a bookmark in Firefox, it should appear at or near the top of the list as you type the first view characters.
