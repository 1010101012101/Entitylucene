apachectl Yields 404 on Shortname, Base Directory Pages <body> I am building a website for my own education, and am trying to learn Apache.  Consequently, I've noticed an odd behavior I was hoping someone could explain.  Basically, when I start Apache via WebSharing, I can access both my shortname index and the base directory that Apple provides.  When I try to visit the same Apple-provided sites after starting Apache via command line codesudo apachectl start/code, I get code404/code on both pages, even though codetop/code registers codehttpd/code processes running.  What don't I understand about Apache as provided by Apple?  <comment58565> Placeholder - edit I made is not accurate. <comment58567> The solution is to create a `/usr/htdocs`.  In my case, I created a symlink to the default /Users/name/Sites. <comment58631> That doesn't make much sense, I suspect something is off with your configuration. <comment58661> Any thoughts in particular?  I don't want to be reliant on Apple's button-pressing magic, as I would like to rebuild this server on a different OS and want to know more about Apache. <comment58669> Did you install a second Apache installation by any means? <comment58688> No, not at all.  I am only using the default, bundled-with-Lion Apache. <comment58690> Even having edited `/etc/hosts` and setting up virtual hosts, without the symlink Apache-launched-without-WebSharing cannot find my local site.  Go figure.
