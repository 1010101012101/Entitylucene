An Error Has Occurred: Downloading and installing Keynote <body> Update: Looks like the installer is looking for a previous version of Keynote to upgrade, from appstore.log:  precodestoreagent[473] &lt;Critical&gt;: SoftwareMap: No app was found with bundle ID com.apple.iWork.Keynote to upgrade to 6.2 /code/pre  First question here.    I purchased Keynote last night and switched to the Purchases tab to watch the download begin (0K of about 434MB).  Immediately the progress bar changed to the Installed button but I saw (via Little Snitch) that bandwidth was still being consumed by storeagent.  Later, storeagent stopped consuming bandwidth and App Store said Could Not Download Keynote: An Error Has Occurred.  In Applications I saw Keynote with its own progress bar empty.  I've tried emptying the ~/Library/Cache for storeagent, signing in and out of the App Store, restarting the Mac (OS X Mavericks) to no avail.  Any ideas?  Here are the most relevant entries from Console:  precode6/19/14 6:18:26.767 AM storeagent[401]: *** Assertion failure in -[SoftwareInstallOperation _startInstall], /SourceCache/Pisa/Pisa-232.9/iTunes Protocol/Built Into App/SoftwareInstallOperation.m:338  6/19/14 6:18:26.768 AM storeagent[401]: error Error Domain=SoftwareInstallOperation Code=0 "The installation could not be started."

In the Terminal run:     defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true   Start App Store, in the Debug menu, choose Reset App, sign in again, then choose Start Scan for Updates.  Tried Keynote again and it worked.    <comment160610> Please use code formatting, not quote formatting, for logs.
