Intempestive remote server/connection failed windows <body> I have the following connection failed message on OSX 10.12.4. I'm used to access to a distant hard drive through a VPN (Cisco Anyconnect), but I removed that connection and the vpn software about two months ago. Everything was fine until yesterday where that message always showing up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVCQ8.png" alt="Connection failed picture"  I've been in touch with Apple customer support, but so far, they were not able to help. There is no trace of the former server in network system preferences, finder, etc.   By monitoring the console, I noted that I have the following logs when the error windows show up : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DHXag.png" alt="logs"  Regarding the logs, I checked in keychain if they were any references to the remote server, but I did not find anything. Would someone have an idea about how to solve the problem ?  <answer284250> Found the problem, if anyone has it. Bitdefender tries to follow old shortcut that I have pointing toward folders on the remote server. I don't know why suddenly it tries to follow those folders, but if you need to solve this problem :  ol liOpen bitdefender/li liClick on "Antivirus for Mac" in the menue/li liPreference/li liExclusions/li liAdd the problematic folders, it should do the job/li /ol  <comment357120> Welcome to Ask Different.

The request was allowed via connection alert." <comment358425> Hi, I just did a clean install and re-installed some of my software (airmail, dropbox, steam, chrome, bitdefender), the message keeps showing up.
