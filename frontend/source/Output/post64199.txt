Mouse pointer disappears in web browser <body> I have this issue and from what I discovered a lot other people do - my pointer disappears. I can see stuff beneath reacting to the movement, but the pointer is gone. It happens rarely, but is confusing enough. Cmd + Tab to Finder fixes the issue, but then when going back to the browser, the pointer is gone again.  It mostly happens in Safari and Chrome. I haven't seen any solution that works.  I'm using OS X 10.8, but this problem existed before that too.  <comment75314> Do you have always the same web sites open when it happens? <comment76120> no, but some of the sites are similar, my gmail is always open. <comment76129> If it only happens in the browser it's most probably coming from something happening inside it - JavaScript running in a window/tab or browser extensions. If the sites are different I would proceed the analysis by disabling all extensions for a few days to see if the problem goes away then. <comment77851> I don't use any extensions (except for AdBlock)
