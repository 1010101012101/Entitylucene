Key to boot from USB on Ubuntu MacBook Air <body> Recently, I removed OS X from my MacBook Air and installed Ubuntu 14.04 on it.  I have been trying to install Debian during last week, but I don't have idea what's the key to enter into 'BIOS boot options' to boot from pendrive.  <answer176841> hold the C key to boot from any media(s)  <comment208924> C for 'external boot' Opt for a choice - https://support.apple.com/en-is/HT201255 <comment208926> Doesn't work, when I hold the C key, it dispays a grey screen during some seconds and after starts from sda1 and load my os. <comment208930> if C doesn't work, your device is not bootable <comment209099> Option. If that don't work, then worry about bootability <comment209961> worked with Alt. <comment209974> how about ALT? ;) <comment210143> alt == opt... it's the same key
