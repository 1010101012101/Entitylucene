rEFIt, linux and optibay <body> I've installed rEFIt on my mid-2010 MBP, currently running Lion.  I'm going to buy an optibay, fit an SSD and install ubuntu on it.  Will it be possible to get the ubuntu installation to appear in the rEFIt boot menu?  Also, is it possible to get my existing Windows partition to appear in the rEFIt boot loader?  The windows partition was installed before I installed rEFIt.  Thanks.
