Now I can't get things back to the way it was before clicking that OFF. I have no internet, phone, text, gmail on my 4s iPhone now! Help!  So, I cANNOT receive email from you now, either! I'm on desktop and can't get on as guest...  <answer134533> If you have removed VPN connection completely, it's easy to configure your VPN again. As I don't know the details of your VPN, here is very general PPTP configuration guide that could give you better idea of the procedure:  ol liChoose strongSettings/strong from your home screen./li liChoose strongGeneral/strong/li liChoose strongVPN/strong/li liChoose strongAdd VPN Configuration/strong/li liChoose strongPPTP/strong at top of screen./li listrongDescription =/strong whatever you wish, for eample: "VPN Connection"/li listrongServer =/strong VPN server IP address or hostname./li listrongAccount =/strong Enter your VPN Username /li listrongPassword =/strong Your VPN Password/li listrongRSA SecurID =/strong OFF/li listrongEncryption Level =/strong Auto/li listrongSend all Traffic =/strong ON/li listrongProxy =/strong OFF/li liClick strongSAVE/strong at the top/li /ol  strongConnecting and Disconnecting/strong  Just go to Settings and slide VPN selector to on. You will receive a welcome message and a VPN indicator will appear at the top of your deviceâ€™s screen. To disconnect, go to Settings and slide indicator to off.  Hope it could help  <answer216452> What you have to do, if you were fooled into the app hooked, is go into settings then general. From there, find profile and click delete account with hooked.   <comment157942> I don't see how disabling VPN would cause a lot of damage? What did you do exactly? <comment157948> VPN turns off *every time you lock your phone*, so this doesn't make much sense. <comment158996> As Rob and 0942v8653 told you, we need more indications about your problem because right now it is hard to understand it. <comment250197> Sounds like the OP activated airplane mode inadvertently. VPN would have no affect on the wifi or phone radios.
