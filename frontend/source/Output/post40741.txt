Access the system library folder rather than the user library folder with Terminal <body> I am trying to codechmod/code a folder in the library of my Mac but I can only get to the folders below the user level.  I need codeLibrary/WebServer/Documents/.../code, but I can only get to codeuser/me/.../code, etc.  Does anyone know what I need to do?  <answer40743> Even administrator users should use codesudo -s/code or codesudo chmod /Library/Webserver/code since the default group structure on OS X is to protect system resources from modification without the logging the privilege escalation. You will need to be an administrator of the mac to use sudo, so you can always codesu/code to an existing admin account first before using sudo.
