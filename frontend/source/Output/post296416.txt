What is the normal temperature for Mac while exporting 3000 photos to a SD card? <body> I recently copied 3000 photos to an SD card during that time the fan speed was 1400 RPM and after half progress the temperature was 75 °C, then after 5 secs it decreased to 50 °C. Is this normal for a MacBook early 2015 Retina display?  <comment374363> Intel® Core™ M-5Y31/M-5Y51 processor: TJunction = 95 °C
