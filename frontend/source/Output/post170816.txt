Make keyboard movement keys (like ^f, ^b) work in non-english layouts <body> They work perfectly in the english keyboard layout in almost any window with text input. But as soon as I switch keyboard layout to something not-english (russian in my case) those shortcuts stop working.  How can I fix it? I've got really used to it.  <comment200893> did you look for the layout differences (key positions)
