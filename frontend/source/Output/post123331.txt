Is there a way to disable the sorting on click within mail.app? <body> Let me first tell you my specific problem:     I'm setting up mail.app for a senior citizen (read as in bad eyesight,   bad hand-eye coordination). I taught a setup were emails would be   sorted by newest first. But every other week it happens instead of   opening the most recent email some sort column would be clicked (and emails will permanently be sorted in some non-intuitive way).   Reproducing the order is a "precision" task the person can not do   alone.   So I'm asking is there a hidden option to permanently disable this emfeature/em (similar to iOS)?  Or at least what would it take to program some tool that will revert this "setting"?  <answer123362> Someone might know if you can disable the sorting, but if that isn't possible, you can create a keyboard shortcut to switch the sorting back.   Would that be something the user could type?  ol liGo to System Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts / Applications./li liClick the + button./li liChose Mail.app/li liType codeDate/code into the Menu Title field/li liSelect an easy to press and remember combination. (You can't overwrite already existing shortcuts. When I tried this to    test if it would work I used kbdcommand/kbd kbdshift/kbd    kbdD/kbd )/li liClick "Add" and you are set./li /ol  <comment144620> I will try that. I just will leave the question open for a few more days in hope a permanent solution shows up.
