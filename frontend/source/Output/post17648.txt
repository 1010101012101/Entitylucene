How to play Flash games in iPad without internet connection? <body> I want to play flash games with iPad 2, so someone told me iSwifter can help.  I want to know whether iSwifter can only run with internet connection. If it needs connection, is there any other application the can play flash games without internet?  <answer17654> There is no application that can play flash games without the internet. That is a pretty good idea, though.   <answer86395> Yeah, there is no app can play flash games without the internet.   I only found some cool flash player for iPad in aneesoft blog to play flash videos.   <answer107763> No its not possible to play flash games without being connected to the Internet, it's like using a phone without a battery. My suggestion for you is play flash games online directly from your browser.  <comment19300> Pretty much out-of-luck on this one. iSwifter requires internet access to work.
