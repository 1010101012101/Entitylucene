Can't find untested extension in order to remove it: SafariTabSwitching <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bq4Rj.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't need this extension anymore because Safari 9 has this feature built-in, but I can't find it anywhere to disable or remove it. It's not listed in my Preferences - Extensions. I looked through my ~/Library/Safari/Extensions but it's not listed there either.  How do I remove this extension so that I don't get this annoying popup every time I launch Safari?  <answer217796> Generally, Safari plugins should be in code/Library/Internet Plug-ins//code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/igBd2.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, I discovered SafariTabSwitching is actually in a different location  emSource : Safari Tab Switching FAQ/em     strongHow to uninstall?/strongbr   Remove this file: code/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/SafariOmnibar.bundle/codebr   Alternatively you may download this uninstaller and run it. Note that uninstaller won't remove SIMBL Agent as you may use some other SIMBL plugin and we don't want to break them.   <comment263383> I don't see anything similar to SafariTabSwitching in "/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Disabled Plugins" or in "/Users/kenny/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Disabled Plugins". I also recursively grepped the entire /Library and ~/Library trees for the text SafariTabSwitching. <comment263428> I discovered it's a SIMBL  plugin. Answer revised accordingly
