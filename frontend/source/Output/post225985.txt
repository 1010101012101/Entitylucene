Unable to install with admin <body> I am trying to update MAMP MySQL from this link, but when i double click the file as mentioned in the blog. I get message saying,      The file “Install_MySQL_5.6.25.command” could not be executed because you do not have appropriate access privileges.   I tried to see the rights strongGet Info/strong and it shows i am the owner and i have read and write. br If i am the owner, why can't i install it?   <answer225991> The file might not be marked executable. Try this:  ol liOpen Terminal.app/li liEnter: "chmod u+x " (without the quotes but with the space) but don't press enter yet/li /ol  3.Drop the "Install_MySQL_5.6.25.command" file on the Terminal.app window.  The full path to "Install_MySQL_5.6.25.command" should appear.  ol start="4" liPress enter/li /ol  The file is now marked as executable and you should be able to run it.  <comment274347> It says cannot execute binary file <comment274349> Try typing: file drop the .command file on the window  it will show you what kind of file it is. Where did you get the file? Can you supply a link or the first few lines of the file? <comment274350> I got the [link](http://blog-en.mamp.info/2015/07/how-to-use-mysql-5-6-with-mamp-and-mamp.html) from here <comment274351> Looks like the file might simply not be executable yet. I have updated my answer to account for that. Make sure the file is unzipped too!
