Shutdown mac with kill all processes <body> Is it possible to shutdown/restart the Mac completely (processes-wise)? My problem is that I'm having issues with terminating a service (codepkill/code and codekill/code are not doing the job, I don't know why), and if I shutdown or restart the computer, the processes are still running in the background.  The processes I'm talking about are codecatalina/code and codetomcat/code - manually started Apache services.   <answer278066> The processes which you mentioned (catalina &amp; tomcat) are not system services. These must have been set to start their daemon when these packages/services are installed and executed for the first time. Please refer this https://www.mulesoft.com/tcat/tomcat-start to get more information on how you can set it to run manually.  <answer278070> The way to do this is given in my answer here. However this is not a duplicate as the other question asks about GUI apps.  The command you need is shutdown  e.g. to reboot the machine immediately  precodesudo shutdown -r now /code/pre  e.g. to shutdown the machine in 60 minutes  precodesudo shutdown -h +60 /code/pre  If tomcat and catalina are setup correctly then they will controlled by a launchd setup (or if less well done a Unix script) that will restart the process(es) when the machine starts up or the process is killed. So running kill on then does kill them but another process will start.  <answer278071> Two items are likely wrong:     ul   li...the processes are still running in the background.  /li   limanually started apache processes/li   /ul   Both are probably not so. They have been restarted automatically. To prevent this,  ol liTry to kill the process by sending it the TERM signal  precodesudo kill -15 {PID} /code/pre/li liCheck if your services are restarted automatically by launchd  precodelaunchctl list | grep tomcat /code/pre  If yes, unload e.g.   precodesudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist /code/pre/li /ol  <comment349938> Please be more specific about the processes in question. If you restart your computer, *all* processes do get killed and are restarted as needed. So if there are some specific processes which bother you we need to investigate what actually is executing them. <comment349940> @patrix, I updated my post. <comment349943> If the tomcat etc tasks are setup correctly killing them should restart them <comment349944> Are you asking how to shutdown the Mac or to stop certain processes (stopping process is not shutdown)
