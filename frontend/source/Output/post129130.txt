To how many bluetooth receptors can I send sound from my MacBook? <body> I have two 2.1 surrounds system at home and I would like to pair both with my MacBook via bluetooth to play at the same time. Is that possible? In that case, what should I look for?  I did a little research and found that a mac can pair up to 7 devices (in the link that follow this message). But it doesn't answer my question. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3887#howmany  Some idea? Thanks in advance!  <answer129172> I have used aggregation to play sound via Bluetooth and wired audio at the same time. I originally used soundflower. But you can use apples AudioMIDI app which does the same thing.  Apple have instruction here.  How to combine multiple audio interfaces by creating an aggregate device  Which basically shows you how to create a single output selection that sends the output to more than one device.  I am unable to test this against multiple Bluetooth devices but think if there is any way to do it then this would be it.  <comment151160> so what is your question then? <comment151222> @Buscar: My question is on the topic ;) To how many bluetooth receptors can I send sound from my MacBook (at the same time)?Is that possible?
