Why ALT+. (last parameter) does not work in Bash? <body> I am used to it from Linux terminals. Using both Terminal and iTerm.  <answer256333> Try kbdESC/kbdkbd./kbd instead, this will work in both Terminal and iTerm.  <answer266541> By default, the Alt-key doesnâ€™t work in MacOS (OSX) Terminal. Simple solution for this problem:  Terminal  Preferences  Settings  Keyboard Just check codeUse option as meta key/code at the bottom!  This will disable Mac extended characters (ex.
