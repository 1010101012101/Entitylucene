Email pdf to PC and the attachment does not show on PC <body> When i email files (usually PDF ) files many of my recipients on PCs do not see the attachment.  Iphones and ipads no problem. I have seen where i must put the attachment at the end of a msg, and make sure it is an icon. Supposedly if set a certain Boolean to false it forces the attachment to the end of the email, but not for me.   Plus I right click to make sure displayed as thumbnail.  defaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool false  But nothing works..

Most PCs see attachments as just that, a 'link' at the bottom of the email, not inlined & visible like in Mail. <comment211976> I just did some more testing. I will work properly if i send the email plain text with the attachment .
