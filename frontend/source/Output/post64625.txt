Turn On Air Play on iPad Without Double Tapping Home Button <body> Is there a way to enable Air Play Mirroring on the iPad without (!) double tapping the  home button?   I'd like to physically lock away the home button to use the iPad on a booth but still be able to mirror the screen on an Apple TV. Is this possible?  <answer64626> If you have gestures enabled, you can swipe up using 4 fingers and then scroll to the left to access Air Play.  Not sure of any other ways.
