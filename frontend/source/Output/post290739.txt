FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in) detected on USB hub, but no picture? `sudo Killall VDCAssistant`, restarting, etc does nothing <body> Why does my laptop camera keep losing picture? Is this possibly just a hardware failure? Specifically, this is in regards to a mid-2012 MacBook Air running macOS Sierra 10.12.5 with a 2GHz i7 &amp; 8GB RAM. The laptop has led a pretty sedentary, suburban life (not banged around a lot or used on the go). Maybe it's just five year old ribbon cables from the camera through the laptop hinge finally giving up?    As of today, the camera picture just isn't coming back. None of these get me picture again:    ol listrongzapping the PRAM:/strong    ul lihold down kbd⌘/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdp/kbd+kbdr/kbd while booting/restarting...  /li lilet the mac chime 3-4 times, then let go./li /ul/li listrongDisk Utility's First Aid in recovery mode/strong (or internet recovery mode):    ul likbd⌘/kbd+kbdr/kbd, or,/li likbd⌘/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdr/kbd at bootup/li /ul/li listrongresetting the SMC/strong (System Management Controller):    ul lishut down, unplug power, hold kbdSHIFT/kbd+kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdPOWER/kbd for ten-fifteen seconds then boot up./li /ul/li listrongApple Hardware Test/strong:    ul liRestart holding down kbdd/kbd  /li liRunning the basic test, and, running the extended test just result in the message: code4HDD/11/40000000: SATA(0,0)/code for a computer which does not have an HDD.../li /ul/li licode$ sudo killall VDCAssistant/codebr codeNo matching processes were found/code/li licodesudo killall AppleCameraAssistant/codebr codeNo matching processes were found/code/li /ol  ... no picture, but the camera is emstill/em detected in USB:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X7tNO.png" alt="enter image description here"  After zapping PRAM, resetting SMC, recovery mode Disk Utility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AczjR.png" alt="After zapping PRAM, resetting SMC, recovery mode Disk Utility:"  After codesudo killall VDCAssistant/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HS0jh.png" alt="After &lt;code&gt;sudo killall VDCAssistant&lt;/code&gt;"  OF NOTE:   ul liI'm not sure, but I don't think AppleCameraAssistant is a thing anymore in macOS Sierra?/li liAlso, takes a couple invocations of code$ sudo killall VDCAssistant/code to get the codeNo matching processes were found/code return message.

Thanks you.  (sad there is no support for the unicode character: &#x23FB;)  <answer291415> Just wanted to chime in and say that this also just started happening to me. I'm on an identical system: 2012 MacBook Air, 2Ghz i7, 8GB RAM, running 10.12.5. I managed to fix it yesterday but it happened again today. I think it has something to do with the Zoom.us video meeting software? Very annoying since I just started a new remote job where I need to have Zoom meetings with folks fairly regularly...  <comment366997> What does rebooting without First Aid do? <comment367000> @Tetsujin nuthin. <comment367002> Then you need to try figure out what needs fixing each time. .. then what's breaking it. <comment367032> @Tetsujin Are you aware of any non-expert level means to capture the entire state of my computer with the camera working so that I may capture the state of it when it stops working and examine the Delta? <comment367035> I suppose [enabling the Disk Utility debug options](https://www.lifewire.com/enable-disk-utilities-debug-menu-2260807) might be a starting place... <comment367036> There's no debug since El Cap. All I could think would be to try over-installing the latest combo updater. I'd also try the hardware test. <comment367478> @Tetsujin thanks - the Apple Hardware Test reports that my laptop (which only has an SSD) has an HDD error: `4HDD/11/40000000: SATA(0,0)`. Seeing as the AHT screen reports is circa 2013, I am suspicious of it's usefulness here. How would I go about over-installing the latest combo updater? <comment367919> Welcome to Ask Different.

Did you try all the steps - pram zap, repair disk first aid, `sudo killall VDCAssistant`, etc? In addition to fsb's comment, if you feel it was a useful question, please upvote :)
