When swiping between spaces, sometimes the background moves and sometimes it doesnt <body> Since upgrading to Sierra I've noticed that sometimes when I swipe between spaces the background image moves left or right as I swipe along with whatever icons I have on my desktop and whatever (lets say) open finder windows I have. Other times the background remains static but everything else moves left or right as I swipe.   I have the same (default) bg image for all spaces.  I have also noticed that the behavior seems to remembered by the space I am moving to/from. For instance, right now I have 2 full screen spaces and then 4 "desktop" spaces and then 2 more full screen spaces. And if I swipe into or out of the desktop 4 space then the bg remains static, but swiping to any other space, the background moves.  I realize this is not a big deal, but it's annoying... thoughts?  <answer282274> I have this exact same problem. It usually resolves itself after a reboot or removing the affected space but is slight annoying as it does consistently happen after a few hours of uptime.   <comment354613> This might be a bit too late, but I had the same experience a few days ago. I just restarted my mac for software installation and the effect is gone. For the past few days, whenever I switch spaces, the background stays static, not moving, only the other space i'm moving to, slides into the view, unlike the normal perception of the whole spaces being moved out. I couldn't find how to enable it back again. Any idea why it happen and how to enable it? <comment368151> This happens all the time for me on Sierra, on both my work and personal MacBook Pros.
