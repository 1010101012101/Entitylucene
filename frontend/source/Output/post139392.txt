iPhone won't sync with my iTunes account <body> I bought an iPhone 4 online and I'm trying to get my mp3s onto it. I downloaded iTunes on my PC and got them on there, but now I can't get the phone to find the music. I click on Music and it just says that it's empty and you can download music from the store. I'm new to apple product and to smart phones all together (I know I'm late don't judge me.) Please help.   Also, my PC and iPhone have never been synced. I don't know if that's relevant, but I thought I should throw that in here. Thank you.   <answer139481> ol liRun iTunes on your computer/li liDrag and drop your mp3s to the open iTunes window - this will add the songs to your iTunes library/li liConnect the iPhone to your PC /li liClick on the iPhone button once it appears in iTunes/li liGo to the Music tab once you entered into your iPhone in iTunes/li liCheck the "Sync music" and "Entire music library" options as described in the first section here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1351/li liClick on the "Sync" button - this will transfer all the songs from your iTunes library to your iPhone/li /ol
