Calendar Event Inspector window appears off-screen <body> I use the Calendar application on a MBP running MacOS 10.12.2; some of the time I have an external monitor attached; other times I use the MBP on its own.  I generally switch between configurations multiple times per day.  After attaching the external monitor, and if the Calendar app main window is on the external display, when I select "Get Info" or press the Space bar on an event to look at the details, the event inspector window sometimes appears off-screen, or partially off-screen, depending on how the displays are arranged.  If the event inspector window emdoes/em appear, it is on whichever display own the Dock.  Is there a way to cause the event inspector window to always appear in the same display as the Calendar view?  Or, if the event inspector window appears off-screen, is there a way to "call it home"?  Currently, the event inspector window only appears if the displays are aligned horizontally and the Calendar app has been restarted after the change in display configuration.
