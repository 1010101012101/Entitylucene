How can I log all notifications? <body> Dropbox, PushBullet, Thunderbird and a dozen other apps create notifications. Is it possible to log these in a Unix-like way?  I dislike the tiny messages popping up for a few seconds and then disappearing without a trace.  Basically, I want to be able to grep a file which contains a line for each notification.  <answer221698> As was linked by Arthur Hammer, https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/142811/37689 states that notifications are stored in an SQLite database. The following python script should get you started:  precode#!/usr/bin/env python import os import re import sqlite3  # Location of notification centers database under Yosemite tmp = os.environ['TMPDIR'] conn = sqlite3.connect(tmp + '/../0/com.apple.notificationcenter/db/db')  for notification in conn.execute('SELECT * from notifications'):     encoded_data = str(notification[-1]) # last item     clean = re.sub('[^\w\s-]', '', encoded_data) # remove some funny stuff (fixme: removes too much?)     sp = clean.split('\t')     # Find NSActualdeliverydate, message content seems to always come after this     for ix in range(len(sp)):         if 'NSActualdeliverydate' in sp[ix]:             break     # Skip blanks     for ix in range(ix+1, len(sp)):         if sp[ix] != '': break      print 'notification', sp[ix].replace('_', '\n').strip()  conn.close() /code/pre  You can then either pipe this to a file and then grep the file, or just grep the output of the script directly.  <comment251115> [This](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/142811/144046) answer and [this one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/168503/144046)Â indicate there is a notification center SQLite database. It's not simple plain text though. <comment268536> Thank you. PushBullet, Dropbox and the other apps I was investigating do not appear to log the relevant data though, sadly. I dumped the sqlite databases and grepped for tokens/strings that I want info on (like the notification titles, files, sourcee, etc - and nothing came up.
