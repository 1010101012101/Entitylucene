Disk Utility reading disk incorrectly; viewing ext4 as JHFS+ and seeing Recovery HD <body> This is imported from Superuser, I felt like I would have an easier time getting an answer here than in Superuser - it is copy pasted, as below.  hr  So, I have some strange issues in Disk Utility and diskutil. It's not a problem (hopefully), but I just want to make sure that I'm not on the path to disk corruption or failure. This is how my disk utility reads my hard disk:  (as they are listed)  ul liDisk Description  : APPLE SSD SD0256F Media /li liTotal Capacity    : 251 GB (251,000,193,024 Bytes)/li liConnection Bus    : PCI /li liWrite Status :  Read/Write/li liType and Location : Solid State Disk, Internal/li liS.M.A.R.T. Status : Verified/li liPartition Map Scheme :  GUID Partition Table/li /ul  And here are the partitions:  ul liMacintosh HD  ul liFormat : Mac OS Extended (journaled) /li liSize : 202.66 GB/li /ul/li liRecovery HD  ul liFormat : Mac OS Extended (journaled) /li liSize : 650 MB/li /ul/li lidisk0s4  ul liFormat : Mac OS Extended (journaled) /li liSize : 46.8 GB/li /ul/li lidisk0s6  ul liFormat : Linux Swap/li liSize : 681.6 MB/li /ul/li /ul  The reason for my worry is two things: 1) Recovery HD is visible, which, I could be mistaken, but this shouldn't be visible OR mounted in Disk Utility, and 2) disk0s4 is actually ext4, NOT JHFS+.

Anyone have an inkling to why this is, where is disk0s5, and will this be a problem?  <answer202867> If you want better answers, try refining your question. Also, post a comment after my answer, so I will be notified.  Question:     1) Recovery HD is visible, which, I could be mistaken, but this shouldn't be visible OR mounted in Disk Utility   Answer:     In the MBR partition table, the id should be codeAB/code and you have codeAF/code. In the GPT, the partition type should be code426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC/code and you havecode48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC/code. This is why it is visible.   Question:      2) disk0s4 is actually ext4, NOT JHFS+.   Answer:      You used the codegdisk/code to change the partition type code for disk0s4 from codeAF00/code to code8300/code while disk0s4 while it was still mounted. The Disk Utility application will not see the change until you unmount and mount disk0s4.   Question:      where is disk0s5   Answer:     Currently, the fifth entry in the GPT is not being used. You have not given any information regarding the values in this table entry, other than due to its absence the partition type must be code00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/code. For all anyone knows, the UUID, attributes, label and starting/ending sector numbers may still be stored in the fifth table entry.    Note: I have observed the Disk Utility application requires the entries in the GPT to be in ascending order and contiguous. The output of the codegpt/code command shows the indices to be in ascending order, but since the fifth entry is missing, the indices are not contiguous. When a situation like this occurs, the Disk Utility application can incorrectly display the contents of the GPT. emIn your case, the errors shown by the Disk Utility application where most likely caused by the use of codegdisk/code./em  Why did you use a BIOS/MBR install of Ubuntu? I know you can download such an iso, but the EFI/GPT iso version also works on Mac's. This is what I choose for my mid 2007 20-inch iMac. This way you can avoid using a hybrid GPT.  <comment244919> Questions 1) and 3) are well enough answered - thank you for that. I have somehow resolved Question 3) with disk verification and repair, and I don't really mind the Recovery partition showing up. In Question 2), the situation has changed but Disk Utility still is incorrect in the way that it identifies the partition: it now says that disk0s4 is formatted as MS-DOS, yet the partition is definitely ext4 (checked it with gparted). I feel as though the fault does not lie with my use of gdisk (as the partition has been remounted on the frequent reboots that I do), so is there another explanation?
