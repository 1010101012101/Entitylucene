Which process is eating my connection? <body> I found something is eating 100KB of my rx Internet connection.  Doing iftop I found that most data is coming from 69.31.72.192.  Running this command line:  precodelsof -P -i -n | cut -f 1 -d " " | uniq /code/pre  the list of processes is this  precodeUserEvent SystemUIS Finder sharingd Dropbox Google /code/pre  Dropbox syncing is paused, Google goes away if I close Chrome, but the connection is eaten anyway...  I came from linux and it is really shocking to see the system eating resources without knowing what is going on...   My four suspects are   precodeUserEvent SystemUIS Finder sharingd /code/pre  I actually have two questions:  ul liHow can I check which is the exact process that eats the connection?/li liCan I take control on how the process(es) use my connection (which is really limited)?/li /ul  <answer122728> Activity Monitor has a network tab which should show you what you need. It has columns for process and sent/received packets &amp; bytes.   <comment143245> turn off sharing. run netstat <comment143246> How would you know which processes are taking resources  in Linux? <comment143251> Linux - `ps aux` and netstat <comment143265> Both those are on OSX so what is different?
