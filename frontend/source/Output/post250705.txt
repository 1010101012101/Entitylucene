how can I tell which prepaid SIM number is which? <body> I have two IPad devices with two different prepaid SIMS. How can I tell which number belongs to which? When I look on the settings it says Unknown. When I look on the 24/7 Telstra app it lists the two numbers but does identify which device they belong to.  I want to recharge one device and not the other but not sure which to add the credit to...   <comment311625> Call customer support, or check the sim holder that came with them.
