How to change how long notifications stay on a Mac? <body> I have a webpage that will display notifications to OS X's notification (system notifications).  But it will disappear in 10 to 15 seconds.  Is there a way to change how long it stays?  (and what about change to not disappear at all?)  I found several pages dated 2014, which suggested using  precodedefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime 60 /code/pre  or use code3/code instead to make it 3 seconds. But this method doesn't work for my Mavericks and El Capitan OS X.  <answer255149> precodedefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui bannerTime 2 /code/pre  Works for me on El Capitan.
