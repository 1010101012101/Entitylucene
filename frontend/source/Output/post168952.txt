How do I do a clean install of Mountain Lion with no disc? <body> I purchased an iMac in late 2013. This model has no disc drive. It came with Mountain Lion pre-installed. If I ever needed to perform a clean install of Mountain Lion, how can I? I don't have an installer file and no disc came with the computer. What's the official way to deal with the fact that I essentially don't own a copy of the OS my computer came with?  <answer168964> For Repairs/Recovery:  One is to use the build in recovery installed on your hard drive. To check for it use disk utility, but it is a hidden partition so make it non hidden first.  Second one is to use the Internet Recovery.  For clean install:  is to create a bootable USB, with complete ML installer. (you need to have/purchase the ML installer package), and a USB with 8GB space.   http://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/How-To-Re-Download-Apps-From-The-Mac-App-Store.htm  Example:  OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0     The OS X Recovery Disk Assistant lets you create OS X Recovery on an   external drive that has all of the same capabilities as the built-in   OS X Recovery: reinstall Lion or later, repair the disk using Disk   Utility, restore from a Time Machine backup, or browse the web with   Safari.      Note: In order to create an external OS X  Recovery using the OS X   Recovery Assistant, the Mac must have an existing Recovery HD.      To create an external OS X Recovery, download the OS X Recovery Disk   Assistant application. Insert an external drive, launch the OS X    Recovery Disk Assistant,  select the drive where you would like to   install, and follow the on screen instructions.   <comment198382> My wife purchased a Mountain Lion upgrade from the App Store and we created a USB installer from that. Can I use that on my computer, or is it copy protected and tied to her computer? <comment198386> It is a universal installer. No copy protection.
