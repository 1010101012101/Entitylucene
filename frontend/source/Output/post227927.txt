Trouble Installing Pygame on Mac - error code 255 in None <body> I need to install pygame on my MacBook for a class, I was able to get it installed fine on my Windows machine, but the OSX installation process has been much rougher. The error I'm getting when try and clone the mercurial repository:   precodepip3 install hg+bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame Command "hg clone --noupdate -q http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame /var/folders/97/gp7g9lv51w92vlqkbskfx55c0000gn/T/pip-zu8qunw4-build" failed with error code 255 in None /code/pre  Also all of the other steps in the installation worked fine and Mercurial is properly installed.  <answer228041> Using brew and not hg fixed the problem, I used this line for installation:   precodebrew install homebrew/python/pygame /code/pre  <comment277839> Does that directory exist (and why use such an odd one) <comment277841> If you don't need to use `hg` you might have better luck with https://brew.sh on OS X - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/222333/pygame-installed-through-homebrew-does-not-work <comment277842> @Mark I didn't specify a directory, I simply used the command: pip3 install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame <comment277844> Welcome to Ask Different.
