OSX Mail duplicated same email multiple (67) times in outbox after failing to send <body> Yesterday I was hooked up to a poor internet connection when travelling abroad.   As a result, my emails got stuck in the "outbox" when I tried to send them. Not a big issue as it was nothing urgent.  I noticed however that Mail kept trying to send these emails, and each time another copy of the email was added to the outbox with a new timestamp. Before I called it a night there were 67 entries of the same email - just a log I told myself, because no email client can be so stupid that it will create new copies for each delivery attempt without disregarding the previously failed ones..  So today, only minutes after connecting to a better internet line at a different hotel I received a "Mail - thanks :)" email from a colleague, enclosing a screenshot of his inbox with, yes you guessed it, 67 copies of the same email from me.   Any thoughts on how this could have happened and how to prevent it in the future?  For the record, my setup is  ul liStandard OS X Mail app on El Capitan./li liIMAP for incoming mail/li liSMTP for outgoing mail/li /ul  Thanks, Geir
