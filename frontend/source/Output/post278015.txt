Is this access possible with iOS? <body> I've been told by a "friend" (completely questionable at this point) that they can access my phone and it's contents without ever having touched my phone (phone comes and stays with me at all times). They claim "I can go through your phone,  look at all your apps and you'll never know because you can't see that I accessed them." The type of access they described doesn't sound like access but copying the phone image to another phone but that's something they show in TV shows. My question is if this is possible or are they actually bsing me?  <comment349885> It sounds like total BS to me, unless they have your iCloud password.
