The document “X” could not be autosaved. You don’t have permission <body> I have a Mac OSX Lion file share over the AFP protocol in our office and users are having trouble saving to it. Here's the process:  ol liOpen an existing file on the server/li liMake changes/li liSave changes, error: "The document “X” could not be autosaved. You don’t have permission."/li /ol  Additional notes:  Users cannot save new files directly to the server (same permissions error); however, they can save the file to their desktop first and then drag it to the server in the same location.  Here is a print out of the permissions for that particular directory:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xlPCL.png" alt="enter image description here"  The permissions appear to be wide open...emright?/em  For what it's worth, here is a screenshot of the error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kkjKI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any ideas what I can do to resolve this issue?  <answer70515> Which place do you have users created on the server?  Are they here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LuONS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Or are they here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqZeI.png" alt="enter image description here"  The important question is are they local users (which will give you the behavior you have) or are they local NETWORK users?  <comment81842> Thanks for your answer. They are created in server.app, but mine looks slightly different than yours. Remember, I'm on 10.7 server: http://cl.ly/image/003A3u1Z3M2F <comment81843> It's all I had to screen shot, sorry.  Is only one person opening a file at a time?  Or are three or four (multiple users) opening the same file? <comment81845> I've tried it in both scenarios. Same issue. <comment81857> Are there any flags on the directory, and what xattrs does it have? Try `ls -leO@d` (and be sure to run that on the server, not a client). <comment81863> I tried, sorry to have wasted your time.  At least you know something it's not.
