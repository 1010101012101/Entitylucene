How can I enable magic mouse momentum scrolling in Windows 7? <body> I have my magic mouse and I've gotten it working with windows 7. Left and right click work as well as scrolling.  Now I want smooth/inertial scrolling as well as middle click. Is it possible?  Also is there a way to imitate the ability in OS X to scroll any window regardless of whether or not that window has focus?  <answer7574> I don't believe there is any way to setup middle click unless you do something like map a key/mouse combination to middle click in some applications.  The fact that the magic mouse doesn't have a middle button means you can never 'tell' window that you've pressed it.  If someone wrote a driver which accepted both right &amp; left buttons being clicked as a middle click that might be possible but I don't know of anything which exists which does that.  <answer7585> Answering the second part of the question, KatMouse is your solution.  It brings very Mac-like cursor/scroll interaction to Windows.  <answer108216> This link has the solution you need for momentum/inertial scrolling under windows. Works pretty well but not as good as OSX though. http://coburner.de/dev.php?s=en&amp;p=Magic_Mouse_on_Windows  <comment8139> You could break out the part about scrolling in windows which are not in focus to a separate question. <comment126880> Answers need to provide more than just a link. In case the link becomes invalid, it is a good idea to summarize the contents of the article to make your answer stand alone. <comment168640> Second the previous comment, as the link is now invalid. <comment182163> This utility can be downloaded from here: https://www.mediafire.com/?lyqrszbajp8f4zj.
