I took a screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5ucN.png" alt="stuck login"  Anybody experiencing the same issue?  <answer272525> Combining part of your solution and part of the solution from Can&#39;t login with Google using Internet Accounts, I got mine to work again by:  ul liOpening Keychain Access  login and searching for 'google', then deleting all the 'accountsync' and 'oauth' entries. The resulted in my Google account being removed from System Preferences  Internet Accounts./li liCompleting this: https://www.google.com/accounts/UnlockCaptcha/li /ul  I was then able to go to System Preferences  Internet Accounts and add my Google account back. It showed the spinny wheel on the gray screen for a second, then disappeared and I was in! Mail and Calendar show my Google data now.  I have 2-factor auth enabled.  Another solution to this would be to login to your GMail account via another program that access's macOS's shared accounts, like Calendar.app.  <comment342450> Same here, with Mac OS 10.12.3 on multiple machines with multiple google accounts. I also created new local accounts on the machines to see if it's a keychain problem. Wondering if it's a macos problem or a google problem? Or something in our network? <comment342452> My theory is it is a change in Google auth and Apple has to react. Or one of them aims for world domination! <comment342459> I am talking to Apple support right now and it is funny how they try to blame it on Google when there is no proof that Google login is failing. Funny and sad world we live in today! <comment342460> Yep same issue exactly on both my macs. I was able to set up my iPhone etc just fine but both macs just hang with the grey screen as pictured after accepting my email address and password. <comment342471> https://discussions.apple.com/message/31380393?ac_cid=tw123456#31380393 <comment342483> In a chat with google they said "It's a workaround for now and is still under the works by our technicians. We appreciate your patience for now." And the workaround was a suggestion to add the google account in apple mail via "Other Mail Account" . Which works, but you will miss calendar sync of course <comment342529> Looks like google fixed it! <comment342564> I have a workaround for this issue as described [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/272520/188697). Hope it helps. <comment342597> I was able to add now without any tweak. Do you think Google or Apple fixed it already? <comment342598> @wesselI agree. I was able to add now without any tweak! Thanks <comment343318> I have faced this issue current and tried many methods but all failed. <comment343402> Tried this myself, still getting problems for it <comment343430> Also reporting issues with this solution on fresh install of sierra <comment343435> Precisely the same problem. Again Apple is breaking essential functionality without as much as whoopsie daisy. Ever since Jobs died, quality is on the decline. Cook's not up to the job. <comment343443> No. Problem persists. <comment343453> Same issue as well :(. The suggested fix of removing the entries in Key Chain ended up removing the account from my other MB. Now re-adding isn't working on either of them ... <comment343484> Try contacting both Google and Apple support. Show them this page. They need not collect data because it is easily reproducible. <comment343490> Update 10 hours later: adding an internet account through Contacts.app worked. Looks like the iCloud sync is working intermittently. Maybe try again?
