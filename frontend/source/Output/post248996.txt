External monitor blurry <body> When I connect my Macbook Pro 13" 2015 to an external monitor, the quality is horrible. I know it' worse than it should be, as I compared it with my Windows.  This is a common problem, as I have seen hundreds of people asking forums going back years. But they all trace back to one solution: http://www.mathewinkson.com/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitor  But this does not work for me... The problems I have read are identical to mine. Is there any other way this could be fixed? I@m honestly considering returning my Mac at this point...  <comment308721> What brand is the external monitor? What resolution and refresh rate are you choosing? What connection method are you using on the MBP and the monitor (HDMI, Mini DisplayPort, VGA)? <comment308794> Use a different interface like DVI or Display Port rather than HDMI and you shouldn't have this problem. <comment372838> Have the same problem and I tried HDMI and VGA output. Both displayed very jagged fonts. Tried on three different monitors. When I go into the display settings it appears to be working in RGB, as intended.
