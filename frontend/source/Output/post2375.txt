Installing mc (midnight commander) without root access? <body> How do I do that? The normal installers (with code.pkg/code files) ask for a root password. It is possible to run normal mac software without root access, but how do I run and install this shell software?  <answer2376> You can compile it yourself or use HomeBrew, that doesn't require root access.  <answer2392> Compile it elsewhere on a Mac where you do have the necessary tools installed. Move the binary over to the other machine.  <comment2033> I can't install homebrew without root: user@mac is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported. Failed during: /usr/bin/sudo /bin/mkdir /usr/local <comment2034> And compiling it myself also requires a lot of sudo - which I can't do. Hell, there is no gcc and cc on this mac. <comment2035> Without gcc you will be unable to install it, with or without homebrew. Btw homebrew can be installed anywhere, see the [official documentation](http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/installation). <comment2044> Why canâ€™t you add yourself to the sudoers file? <comment10852> "NOTE: This method might not work for machines managed with Directory Services." - which is exactly the case for my machine. <comment28017> If you get an error regarding the SSL cert for the mc download be sure to upgrade homebrew first, as there is a fix in the latest release.
