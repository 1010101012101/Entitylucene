Get low battery notifications for mouse earlier <body> Is it possible to tweak the % that I get warning of low battery for my Magic Mouse 2?  I currently only get it at 2% at which point it's very close to dying so I have to stop what I'm doing and plug it in. A reminder about 10-15% would allow me to plug it in the next time I have a natural break.  <answer283897> There is a way!  Sadly you need BTT (Better Touch Tools) for this. BTT was free, but to support ongoing development there is now a pay-what-you-want license model starting at 5 USD. But afaik you can test it for free for some days.  How to set the notification:  ol liStart BTT → Menu bar → Preferences → Basic Settings → Check "Launch BTT on startup"/li liSwitch to Advanced settings (top left hand corner)/li liGo to Mouse settings (top right hand corner) /li liUnder "General" at the bottom there is "Warn if battery level is lower than X %"/li liCheck the option and set your level./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pckxd.png" alt="btt screenshot"  <comment333311> Good question. To bad there is no answer <comment358169> Thanks just installed it now, seems like the app does a lot more that I can poke around with. <comment358293> Yes, the app is for me a must have! Window snapping, custom keystroke commands and so much more!
