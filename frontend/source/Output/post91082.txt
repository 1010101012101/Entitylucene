Thermaltake External HDD USB 3.0 docking station gets unmounted <body> I'm using a Thermaltake External HDD USB 3.0 dual drive docking station on a Mac Air. I can see the files and seem to be able to copy small files fine. When I try to move a lot of files it gets unmounted. The drives are WD 2TB are formatted NTFS and I'm using TUXERA ntfs daemon to read the drives.   Is there a docking station that works on Mac and NTFS drives with USB 3.0? Thermaltake does not have drivers for Mac.
