It looks like you can, but in fact it doesn't affect the menu bar clock.  System Prefs  Language &amp; Region  Advanced...

You can use the Time settings to set a custom menubar clock format: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OR9fW.png" width="64"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDobo.png" alt=""  <comment358866> What device, what OS? <comment358870> This doesn't remove the colon in the menubar! <comment358889> @user3439894 - it has to be Mac, iOS doesn't have System Prefs, & OS is pretty much irrelevant, as it's never been possible. <comment358891> The question as phrased originally didn't make it clear, so I added those bits. <comment358987> Now I understand , the examples where not there before , I thought he was talking about 24h to 12h Format ,I never perceived the colon in time format as being a problem ,sorry I couldn't Help
