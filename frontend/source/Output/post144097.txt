Is it possible to increase price of an App? <body> Is there any way to increase the price of an app being sold on the App Store? (Where one could increase the price as necessary).  Where I could read more about App selling strategies?  <answer144100> You can set and change your price at any time. You can set price changes immediately, or scheduled ahead of time.  You can choose which price from a range of tiers provided by Apple. eg. 99c, 1.99, 4.99, etc.  You can't yourself choose 49c or $2.68, or any arbitrary value.
