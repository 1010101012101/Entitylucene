Strange Distorted Colors on mac wakeup <body> I am using 2015 Macbook Pro 13'' model. I am on OSX Sierra 10.12.3 (16D32).  When I wake up my computer I see strange distorted colors  I searched and found that many people have faced this issue.   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7747195?start=0&amp;tstart=0 https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/54ueud/weird_screen_colors_after_wake_up/  The only solution which I have found is that I go to settings - displays and then change the display resolution and then set it back.  Has anyone been able to permanently resolve this?
