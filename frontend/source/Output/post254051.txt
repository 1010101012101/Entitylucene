Messages not working on El Capitan after password change <body> I am running OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 on a MacBook Pro 15" Retina (mid 2015) with Messages 9.2. I also have an iPhone 6 running iOS 10.0.1.  A few days ago I got an alert that someone had signed in to iMessage on an iPhone 4s that I didn't own. I changed my password, and ever since I haven't been able to use Messages on my MacBook. If I try to send a message using my phone number it tries to send as a text message and fails. If I try to send it from an email address, it sends as an iMessage and fails immediately. Everything works fine on my iPhone, but conversations from my iPhone aren't syncing to my MacBook.  I've signed back in to Messages on both my MacBook and iPhone. I've signed out and back in several times on both. My phone number and emails are all checked in the "You can be reached by iMessage at" setting. I've tried deleting the content in ~/Library/Messages/ and emptying the trash. I've restarted my MacBook several times. Nothing so far has worked.  Anyone know what I should do?  <comment316294> See if any of this is any help - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/105221/messages-wont-let-me-sign-in-to-imessage/205322#205322
