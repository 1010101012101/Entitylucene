How to use a PDF in a presentation <body> I have to make a little keynote tomorrow, and I have all the slides saved as PDFs. I will be using a projector as a second screen to my laptop. What's the best way to transform this long PDF document into something more slidy? If I open in with built-in Preview, I get some annoying issues such as the page number that pops out on the bottom of the slide whenever I flip a page and the non-full-screen-adapting when the ratio of the PDF isn't the same as the ratio of the screen.  So, any solutions?  emNote/em I don't own a Keynote copy, so options like PDF to Keynote are not valid ones.  <answer87618> I'm going to answer my own question a few seconds after I first asked it. The first issue (page number popping out when flipping pages) is easily gone if, instead of using simple Full Screen mode, you use Slideshow (kbdShift/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd) mode.  Still having problems with screen ratio though.  <answer87658> I have switched to Skim from Preview for presenting PDFs on a data projector. It has more &amp; better presentation options and itâ€™s free. Starting with Lion, Preview.app drove me crazy. Regarding screen ratio: If I see correctly, both Applications will strongnot/strong change the aspect ratio of the PDF when in presentation mode (e.g. for square PDFs)  <comment102446> I suspect you can't alter PDF rations - they are designed to be as the originator sets and the viewer cannot alter - which is why I prefer vector graphics or HTML, or I suspect Keynote slides <comment102611> Thank you, I gave it a try and it worked much better than Preview did. It was driving me crazy too! Thank you. <comment102658> You are welcome!
