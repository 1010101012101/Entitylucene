Something keeps directing sub domains back to my own local host 127.0.0.1 <body> I run mamp pro locally for web development and for each site I have internal maps for:  precodedomain.com = remote   dev.domain.com = remote domain.dev = local /code/pre  I expect domain.dev is handled by mamp on my machine, but on one of my domains I try to go to subdomain.domain.com which should be a remote machine I'm being directed to my own 127.0.0.1 localhost.  Could someone point me in the right direction im guessing i need to edit a host file somewhere?  <comment105985> Hmm - seems odd. What does `host subdomain.domain.com` resolve to? Does adding a terminal . after .com yield a different answer? (e.g. `host subdomain.domain.com.`) <comment105989> from the network utility traceroute utility shows it resolves locally to 127.0.0.1  and a . after makes no difference <comment105999> Well - I was hoping to get you to test DNS and not the routing, but since you know that, you've probably not made a DNS mistake. I'd need hands on the machine or more troubleshooting to guess where you are having issues.
