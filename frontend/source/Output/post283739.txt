Not sure how phone synced or how to make it stop? <body> I got an iPhone 6s Plus for work and currently have an iPhone 6s as a personal phone. When setting up the new work phone I used a different email (my work email as opposed to my personal email) and created a new Apple ID. So how would it be possible for me to text my girlfriend (also an iPhone user) from my personal # and it comes through on her phone with my new work #? How would I make this stop?
