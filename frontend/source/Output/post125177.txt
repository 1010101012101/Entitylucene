deleted audio clips play when exporting keynote screen recording to video <body> These audio clips were created when when I re-recorded over the end of a recorded slideshow in Keynote 6.1.  This bug has been around since 2008, but the workarounds (exporting the movie without sound, then getting the audio from package contents and splicing it with the movie in iMovie) posted for it online don't work anymore.   Does anyone have other workarounds? Other than not using keynotes for audio? I've queued up a bunch of recorded slideshows.   I thought of trying to do a screen capture of the screen recording playing, but it plays in full screen. Also, sharing to YouTube hangs the app.
