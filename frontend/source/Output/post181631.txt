AppleScript Quicktime Player to play audio file generates error <body> My Quicktime Player (Version 10.3 727.4) can play mp3 files without any problems, but when I use AppleScript I get an error message:      The document “audio.mp3” could not be opened. The file may be damaged or may not be a movie file that is compatible with QuickTime Player.    I've been trying different sound files, different compressions, aif, wav, with the same result.   A minimum script goes:  precodeset audioFile to "/Path/to/the/audio.mp3"  tell application "QuickTime Player"     activate     open audioFile     play the front document end tell /code/pre  Does anyone have any suggestions of what I'm doing wrong or any other solution to script a media player.   <answer181632> A pure guess would be that you are passing it a text/string reference rather than a file ref.  try codeset audioFile to POSIX file "/Path/to/the/audio.mp3"/code  <comment216022> Yep. That solved it, Thanks a lot! <comment216023> Cool, glad it worked :)
