Using caps lock key instead of right click (contextual menu) <body> I'd like to remap kbdCaps Lock/kbd to right click - for the cases where I can focus on objects with cursor keys, or tab.   For instance after selecting files in Finder I'd like to hit kbdCaps Lock/kbd and get the contextual menu you'd get on right click.  <answer9231> The 3rd party tool http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/ seems to be able to do what you need to remap your keys.  One possibility is to remap kbdCaps Lock/kbd to kbdControl/kbd and thus pressing kbdCaps Lock/kbd + left-click would open the context menu.  Sure, this doesn't remove the need for a mouse click, so the right-click might be a better solution :)  <answer9236> You can use BetterTouchTool for this. Just create a keyboard shortcut which is bound to right-click.  There are to caveats, though:  ul liThe right-click command will be sent to wherever the mouse is, not on whatever is focused via the keyboard./li liTo bind the CapsLock key, you may need to use a combination of KeyRemap4MacBook (to rebind CapsLock to some other key), as well as PCKeyboardHack (to improve CapsLock rebinding support)./li /ul  I'm not sure if there is any way to invoke the context menu on the focused element rather than wherever the mouse is. However, if you do find such a way to do this, you can use a combination of KeyRemap4MacBook and PCKeyboardHack to rebind it to CapsLock.  <comment9941> The user posted the same question at [superuser](http://superuser.com/questions/250794/assigning-caps-lock-key-for-contextual-menu-right-click-on-os-x). (No solution there either at the moment...) <comment146302> this tool is available using a homebrew cask: ``brew cask install keyremap4macbook``
