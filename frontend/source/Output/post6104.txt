What new iPhone App that lets you maintain a single list, star items and sort them? <body> There was a new iPhone app released recently but I can't recall its name. It had some very simple features:  ul liKeep a single list of things/li liStar items/li liSort those items so that stars rose to the top/li /ul  What was its name? The app in question is not 1list.  <answer6105> Figured it out, it was LittleList  <answer6126> I was guessing it was strongWunderlist/strong.
