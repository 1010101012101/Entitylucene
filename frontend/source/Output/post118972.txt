Pixel Perfect iOS7 Lock Screen Image With Apple Configurator <body> I'm using Apple Configurator to supervise a number of devices (iPhone 5S) and one thing that bugs is that our logo on the lock screen is blurry.  I've tried PNGs at both the exact screen and the following I've found from various sources, but no matter what I try the image gets scaled.  What resolution should  my iPhone 5S lock screen image be so that it displays "pixel perfect" after being applied with Apple Configurator?   I can't believe that a company as well known for its design would leave a gap like this.  Thanks  hr     iPhone 5/5C/5S: 1,040x1,536   -- CNET     Wallpaper: 1392 x 744   -- Deko  <comment138743> It doesn't really matter about iOS 7 - see here for various screen sizes... http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/89099/what-size-should-a-background-image-be-for-apple-configurator-to-place-it-on-ios <comment138744> iOS 7 introduces parallax, which certainly does make a difference. As I said before, I've tried creating wallpapers at the native resolution but they're still scaled. <comment138745> My experience is they scale before iOS 7 too. Flat images with extra room for the crop might be needed if you are really peeping pixels. <comment138749> Sigh. The problem is text looks blurry if scaled. Cropping is easy to work around. Thanks though.
