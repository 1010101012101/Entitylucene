save IPv4 address for different WIFI <body> I have a macbook pro, that I use at work and in my house,  the problem is that i have to set up manually the TCP/IP IPv4 address for each place, the address doesn't change once im on a location, but I have to change it manually when I go to the office and when I get home,  So how can I save it so that when I connect a specific WIFI the IPv4 address will get configured specially for that place?  Thanks!  <answer90597> I create a location for places like that.  I have the default location(Auto) for my house but for each of my job sites I have a location with specific hard-coded IP/DNS.  You can create a location in Systems Perf - Network.  Then to select each location go to the Apple icon - location - xxx.  That is the simplest way I think to do it.
