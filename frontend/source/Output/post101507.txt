Restore multiple minimized windows? <body> This question particularly deals with the latest version of Google Chrome on Mountain Lion, but the underlying premise applies to other browsers/applications as well.  What I am wondering is: is there a way (via keyboard shortcut, or third party application) to open a series of minimized windows simultaneously?  For example, in Google Chrome, one might have four windows open (each with a set of tabs), that you minimized with kbdâŒ˜ cmd/kbd + kbdM/kbd. This leads to a few questions:  ol liOnce minimized, is there a keyboard shortcut to bring that window back?/li liIs there a keyboard shortcut that would bring emall minimized/em windows back?/li /ol  I would like to restore emall minimized windows/em with a keypress, not just one at a time.  <answer101514> The opposite keyboard shortcut for the cmd+M is the  kbdcmd/kbd + Tab  that will bring up all open windows  keep holding the kbdcmd/kbd key  scroll till you find lets say Chrome  still holding the kbdcmd/kbd key use up down arrows that will bring all open windows with in that app.  THIS QUESTION WAS ANSWERED HERE:  Actually there a multiple ways doing the minimizing and the maximizing all windows at once.  I prefer the kbdcmd/kbd + kbdF3/kbd to hide all at once. Then kbdF3/kbd to show all.  Then there is a 3 party app called Witch.  <answer101620> If minimizing windows to the application icon has not been enabled, you can unminimize all windows with a script like this:  precodetry     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Dock"         click (UI elements of list 1 where role description is "minimized window dock item")     end tell end try /code/pre  This script would unminimize the last minimized window shown in the Dock:  precodetry     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Dock"         click (last UI element of list 1 where role description is "minimized window dock item")     end tell end try /code/pre  This would unminimize all windows in the current application:  precodetell application (path to frontmost application as text)     if name is "Finder" then         set collapsed of windows where collapsed is true to false     else         set miniaturized of windows where miniaturized is true to false     end if end tell /code/pre  You can assign shortcuts to scripts by for example using FastScripts or Alfred.  <comment119646> Thanks for the reply!  I was actually hoping for a simple key combination that would restore all windows in the dock simultaneously - which is a bit different from the other thread.  The solution presented there is good for restoring one of the minimized windows (select it with up/down), but it leaves the other windows in the tray... <comment119741> This is exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
