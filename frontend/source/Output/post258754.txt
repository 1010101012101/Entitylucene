How do I move a window so that its title bar is above the visible screen area? <body> How can I drag/move a window so that its top is above the screen?  I want to be able to resize a window taller vertically than the screen itself, and then take a picture of the window, but I don't care about getting the window's title bar in the picture, only the content of the window, which is actually smaller than the screen but cannot all be viewed at once because of the title bar making the window's size too large.  <answer258810> Enter Full Screen does exactly that. Click the green button located in the top left of most windows or type the keyboard shortcut code⌘ Cmd + CTRL + F/code You will notice the title bar moves right out of the viewport.  But this can still produce a scrolling window if there is too much content.  Suggestion:  ol liDrag the window down to the bottom of the screen./li liGrab the edge of the window to stretch it taller until you reach the top of the screen./li liPress codeCmd + Shift + 4/code then codepress spacebar/code once. codeClick/code whichever window you would like to capture. Before clicking a window you will notice hovering over a window will highlight it in blue and the mouse will change to a camera./li /ol  Unfortunately, you cannot repeat 1 and 2 if the window still contains too much content. This is because on the second attempt to move the stretched window down the window is automatically reformed to fit the screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQ2Ow.png" alt="screenshot of window at bottom of screen about to be stretched back to the top"  <answer278168> Maybe rotating the display will do the trick. Since screens are landscape by default, try this screen rotation hack to grab some screenshots in portrait mode. It's not really a hack so much as invoking hidden features with the keyboard and a mouse click.  ol liLaunch System Preferences/li liPress codeCmd + Opt/code keys and click “Display” Note: this will not work if have an open System Preferences that has at some point had an active Display pane. In this case you will need to close the System Preferences window and start over with step 1. /li liSelect either 90 or 180 degrees from the Rotation drop down menu./li /ol  Happy snapping.   <comment323558> What is the window you want to capture the contents of, is it a Browser window or other type of app? What Mac do you have? Do you by chance have a Mac that has a Retina Display? <comment323625> Ok good answer, I used some terminology wrong in my question though: when I say title bar, I mean the whole top part of the application window, not just the place where its name is displayed. So, the "title" bar of the app I want to photograph actually remains in ful screen mode.
