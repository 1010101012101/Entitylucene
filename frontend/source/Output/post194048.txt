Can I control audio/vibrate/DND on iOS remotely? <body> I have 2 iPad minis and an iPhone 6+.    Sometimes I like to hear the "ding" of a message or mail, sometimes I dont.  Its a pain to go to each device to change the settings.  Is it possible to set a remote iOS device to DND or turn the volume/vibrate/DND on/off from another device?
