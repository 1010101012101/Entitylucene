iPhone 4S does not get detected in Windows <body> When I connect my iPhone 4S to my computer, iTunes does not detect it. iPhone pops the message of USB connectivity and defaults to Mass Storage. Windows shows the message that "Device is ready to use" and I can read both drives of the iPhone in Windows Explorer. However iTunes does not detect the device and the "Devices" tab does not appear.  I've tried:  Restarting the phone. Restarting the computer. Connecting the phone to a different computer.
