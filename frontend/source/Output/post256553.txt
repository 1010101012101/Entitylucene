Save email on disk <body> I'm using Fastmail and its web interface as my email client and I'd like to clean it up but save multiple hundreds of emails to some text-based format.  Is there any macOS email client or utility that can do it?  <answer256590> You can use Mozilla Thunderbird, with ImportExportTools plugin.  If you need a step by step guide, here is one with images, is quite old, but gives the idea. Use software/plugin from Mozilla site.  <comment320225> The plugin is a bit buggy when trying to export a folder (it misses many emails from it) but I was able to do it in the end by selecting all the emails and exporting them at once instead. :) Thanks!
