How can I control sound from different applications? <body> I have a radio app that I listen to all the time. Then I want to visit a website which has sound (or a game).   Is there a way to mute sound from an application?  <answer28934> I suggest you use jackosx, which is free.  <answer32075> Audio Hijack Pro allows you to mute sound from any application. It is actually for recording an application, but you can mute applications as well. You can use the demo to just mute the sound. You shouldn't have to purchase a license.br Here's a screenshot. As you can see, the controls are at the top. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/swyQE.png" alt="Audio Hijack Pro"  <answer37974> Also take a look at Hear, a systemwide Audio program that does mixing, EQ, etc.  <answer227883> strongFinally something that works like in windows/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/njKUl.png" alt="Screenshot"     Volume Mixer for Mac lives in your menu bar. With simple features like muting apps by double clicking and detaching an app from the master volume by right clicking, Volume Mixer is easy to learn and simple to use.   http://www.volumemixer-app.com/  Sadly not for free but it seems to have been harder work than you think, so support the devs!  <answer227891> Perhaps I'm missing something here (emphasis mine):      Is there a way to strongmute/strong sound from an application?   If you are looking to simply mute quickly across applications, couldn't you just use the kbd/kbd key (I know, the emoji is not an accurate representation of the key, but it's the emthought/em that counts, right?)  <answer256279> There's a nice open source app, BackgroundMusic, that provides for per app volume control in OSX10.10+:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P3YX6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment282095> I sadly muss add this note: It's not that stable it should be. But it's worth a try! <comment305557> OP asked for a way to mute **individual** applications. Not all at the same time. ;)
