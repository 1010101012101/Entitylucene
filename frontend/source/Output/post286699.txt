Photos 2.0 is different on 2 Macs <body> I have emPhotos 2.0/em on my 27" Mac and on my Mac Air. I edited pictures in emPhotos/em on the 27" and then copied that emPhotoslibrary/em to a hard drive so I could continue to edit on my Mac Air on a trip. That library won't open on the Mac Air. The message is "the library is from a newer version of emPhotos/em and cannot be opened". emPhotos/em is emversion 2/em on both Macs. I tried to update emPhotos/em on the Mac Air and get the message that it is "up to date".  Can I delete the emPhotos/em app on the Mac Air and then download and install it again? Or something simpler and safer?   <comment361812> It is safe to delete the Photos app and download it again from the App Store. I'd try that first. If you have access to both Macs just now, click on "Photos" in the menubar and choose "About Photos" to see what the actual version number is of each. On my Mac right now the full version number of Photos is "2.0 (3150.4.120)". <comment362060> Both my Macs show the same 3150.4.120 that you have.  Even so, I will delete the Photos app on my Air (that's the one that Apple says is the older version) and reinstall it.  Thanks - I'll report back. <comment362070> As it turns out, I am not permitted to delete the Photos app.  The message I get is that Photos is part of the Mac OS and cannot be deleted.  Both my Macs are running Sierra 10.12.5  So that rules out deleting and reinstalling Photos in either machine. <comment362071> When you copied the library to your MacBook Air, was Photos open on your iMac? If so, if you copied it while Photos was writing to it, then the file could be corrupt. That might be the reason for the "newer version" message. Even if Photos was closed and you had iCloud syncing enabled, copying the library while the OS was syncing might have corrupted it. <comment362216> Thanks for these thoughts.  I actually did not copy the file onto the Mac Air (to conserve memory).  I connected my 2TB Seagate which had the file on it and tried to open it from there.
