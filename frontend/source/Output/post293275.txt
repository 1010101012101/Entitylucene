Does it make sense to format an external HDD as APFS? <body> I’m currently on macOS Sierra and will upgrade to macOS High Sierra as soon as it comes out, which means my machine will be using APFS.  I also have an external HDD (emnot/em SSD) that has quite a few years on it, already. I use it solely for storage. I have it formatted as exFAT so it’s compatible with both macOS and Windows, out of the box. But recently I’ve noticed that I never connect it to a non-macOS machine.  So, would it make sense for me to reformat my external HDD as APFS? Are there any benefits to it over the current exFAT (speed, file integrity)?  <answer293313> APFS gives several benefits over exFAT, for example:  ul liProtection against meta-data corruption caused by for example sudden power loss, system crash or if disconnect the external hard drive without unmounting it first. exFAT only detects corruption using checksums, but cannot rollback like APFS./li liBetter support for full disk encryption/li liAllows snapshotting the file system (i.e. you can create "frozen" versions of everything on disk, which will never change - even when you continue to alter the contents of your files)/li liAllows cloning a file into two copies that can be independently changed while only requiring the disk space for one file plus the size of the differences compared to the other file/li /ul  On the other hand, exFAT has a range of advantages too:  ul liOlder file system that is "tried and tested" for years on macOS/li liSimpler file system with less overhead/li liMost probably slightly faster (but this will depend on the final implementation in the release version of High Sierra)/li liAs you mentioned, the drive can be used without extra drivers on Windows/li /ul  Only you can decide which set of benefits are most important for you.  <comment370003> Isn't NTFS read-only on macOS? I couldn't write to NTFS without installing additional software like Paragon. However, I would recommend exFAT for compatability with macOS, Windows and Linux <comment370015> @M.J.K Yes, I meant exFAT. I was searching around for this before posting the question, saw a lot of things relating to NTFS and got confused. Fixed. <comment370016> To the people voting to close, how in the heck is this “opinion based”? Either there are explicit technical benefits (as the examples I referenced: speed, reliability) or there are not. Those are not subjective. <comment370029> tbh, right now it's subjective because APFS isn't yet finalised & still in beta. Honestly, I'd give it a year, or at minimum til 10.13.1 - as, if it goes wrong, there are no tools as yet to fix it. <comment370045> @Tetsujin That's not really correct - the High Sierra betas include fsck_apfs for fixing problems with APFS file systems.
