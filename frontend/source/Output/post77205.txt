Parental Controls Always Allow does not work for Avid Media Composer <body> I've enabled Parental Controls on a new Nov 2012 iMac being used in a school for public access (OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion) and have restricted the applications this account can use. Everything works fine with the exception of emAvid Media Composer/em (the main reason we purchased the iMacs...). Avid Media Composer is marked as an application that the account is allowed to use in the parental control settings.  When I try to start Avid Media Composer under this account, a message pops up saying that this user doesn't have permission to use the application, giving the following three options:  ul liAlways Allow.../li liAllow Once.../li liOK/li /ul  When clicking strongAllow Once/strong, I have to enter the admin account username and password and the app starts without problems. But when I click strongAlways Allow/strong, it asks for the admin account as well, but then pops up the same message again and again. I have verified that I'm using the right admin account username and password, but it's still refusing to run the application.  When I disable parental controls, everything works, but the moment I turn it on again, it fails, despite having Avid Media Composer in the list of allowed applications for this account.  In the Console application, I can see the following error message whenever this happens:     com.apple.launchd.peruser.504: ([0x0-0x1de1de].com.avid.mediacomposer[2033])    Job failed to exec(3) for weird reason: 13   Has anybody else experienced this or knows how to fix this?  <answer139445> I found this problem too! Turn off parental control and it works fine. Interesting as I have two Mac Pros and one with PCs on does allow MC to work. The other with the PCs on and it does not. I suppose best answer is to turn off Parental Controls for an separate account just for users whom use AVID.
