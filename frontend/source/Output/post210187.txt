How can I remove the window shadow in El Capitan? <body> ol liI tried ShadowKiller and ShadowSweeper, they do not work anymore on El Capitan./li liI tried to disable System Integrity Protection, but it does not work./li litoggle-osx-shadows also does not work: https://github.com/puffnfresh/toggle-osx-shadows/issues/17/li /ol  Does anyone have other way? Thank you!  <answer235233> To quote many sources, namely Reddit and Life Hacker(to disable system integrity protection):  ol liReboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down kbdCommand/kbd-kbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appears on your screen./li liClick Utilities  Terminal./li liIn the Terminal window, type in codecsrutil disable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd./li liRestart your Mac./li /ol  This emshould/em work.  <answer259590> The Apple System Integrity Protection prevents system files from being tampered with including styling of the UI. For this reason you cannot modify the window without disabling the System Integrity Protection. However doing so may put your Mac in danger. Therefore if the SIP was disabled malware or malicious content could modify or corrupt important system files which are required for the OS to run normally. However the side effect of this is restricted customization.  <answer262959> copied from my question about the same issue:  There is a solution - SIMBL plugin called winBuddy which is available through mySIMBL.  It allows you to turn off window shadow and/or window borders for every app.  I've just tested it and it seems to work properly, there are some minor glitches here and there but nothing major and I think they will get fixed soon.  Minor glitches include:  ul liYou can't change window options for apps which don't have menu - like Bartender for example/li liYou can't change window options for some apps, as winBuddy does not show up under 'Window' in menu./li /ul  edit: I've forked winBuddy and created a version which has window borders set to OFF by default for all apps (that is the look I was going for), maybe someone finds it useful.  <comment254144> Same experience here - ShadowKiller no longer works in El Capitan, and toggle-osx-shadows didn't work for me either. <comment306229> It's worth pointing out that this can make your operating system less secure so it's worth reading about System Integrity Protection before you chose to disable it. <comment324831> I'm assuming that's supposed to be "cannot modify" instead of "can". To improve your answer, consider explaining _why_ a Mac would be "in danger" with SIP disabled. <comment324832> You can disable SIP, proceed to make changes and then reenable SIP. IMHO It's going to be okay, SIP didn't even exist before El Captian.
