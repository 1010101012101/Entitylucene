How can I fix the initial scroll position of a Finder window? <body> When I open my Finder after a reboot or closing all Finder windows, the Finder starts out with the "All My Files" view. However, the scroll position is set such that the first four files are hidden out of view and the 5th file appears as the first file that I can see. To see the first four files, I've got to scroll up.  Interestingly, if I click on another one of my Favoritesâ€”-say, Desktop--and then switch back to All My Files, the scroll position is right where it should be, listing my most recently opened file first. (As opposed to the 5th most recently opened file and hiding the other 4 out of view just above.  Is there a plist file or something I can trash such that it resets the Finder's idea of which file should be first? (Putting the first file... FIRST!)  Really stumped. Wonder if it's a bug.

'~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist' (I would suggest pulling it to your Desktop and restarting to see if it resolves the issue - if not, you can put it back in its original location to prevent losing any of your Finder preferences. If it does resolve the issue, then move it to Trash and re-configure any Finder preferences you had set up previously.)
