Running 3 External Monitors off a Mid 2014 MacBook Pro <body> I have a MacBook Pro retina 15 inch. It's a retina model with a i7 4980HQ 2.8Ghz quad core processor, a 2GB Nvidia GTX 750M graphics with 2GB VRAM and 16GB ram.   I was wondering if I would be able to connect 3 monitors to it to use mostly for coding, but perhaps also some occasional gaming.   would the best way to do it be through the two Thunderbolt ports using a 2 Thunderbolt- DVI adapter and one monitor through the HDMI?   Will they all work properly, will there be any difference in quality if I'm using 3 monitors of the exact same model.   <answer260006> If you Google Mid 2014 MacBook Pro and go to this link Apple says "Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to strongtwo external displays/strong, both at millions of colors."  I added the emphasis.  <comment325446> You probably will be able to run all three displays, despite Apple only saying two are supported.
