Outlook 2011, where are located messages placed in "On my computer"? <body> I'm using Outlook 2011 under OS X Mavericks. I moved some messages to my Exchange account to folders located in the section "On my computer".  I need to know where these messages are physically located on my computer.  <answer127098> You should check out your personal folder (user) and navigate to:  ul liDocuments/li listrongMicrosoft User Data/strong /li liOffice 2011 Identies/li liMain Identity/li /ul  Please note that Outlook 2011 does not use a strong.PST/strong file format  <comment267864> Just a simple footnote... the name of directory "Microsoft User Data" is localized... just in case your OS is not an english version and you happen not to find it :-P
