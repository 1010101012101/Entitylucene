What is the reason for the large minimum brightness of MacBook Air (or other devices)? <body> When I use my MacBook Air in darkness for various reasons (e.g. causal stargazing or working late in close quarters) the last brightness notch before "black" is way too bright for me.   There are add-on work-arounds (see for example Macbook air screen is too bright even on the lowest setting) so I'm not asking how to get lower brightness.  I'm wondering if there are some hardware issues when operating at very low brightness that should be avoided, or if it's just a question of difficulty to assure the customer display quality at very low brightness, or something else?  hr  I just saw this and couldn't help it!

The brain will perceive that as a constant light, but less bright. However if the intervals become too long, you'll start to experience the display as flickering. Therefore there's a limit as to how low brightness you can achieve with this method. <comment355760> @jksoegaard OK that's an interesting theory. I should be able to look at it with a photodiode or phototransistor and oscilloscope, except I don't have those handy. However they may modulate the pulse width at constant period instead of varying the period. But that could also have limitations as well. I like this theory! <comment355981> It is likely a log or linear scale and that is just what you get when computing the values <comment355986> @William Volume is also *likely a log or linear scale* and it works great, going down to very low values before shutting off. I'd guess that Apple can implement whatever scale they decide is optimal for the user experience.
