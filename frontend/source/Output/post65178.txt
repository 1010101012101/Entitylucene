How can I create a custom alert sound in Mountain Lion? <body> I want to use a personal sound file (currently an mp3) instead of the system alert sounds (sosumi, basso, etc.)  I remember this being really easy on Macs a couple of decades ago, but can't figure out how to do so today.  <answer65181> You need add the sound file to code/System/Library/Sounds//code, or code~/Library/Sounds/code. (If you don't know how to locate that easily, you can search for "sosumi", and follow the breadcrumbs at the bottom of the finder window.)  The sound file needs to be converted to AIFF or WAV format. Macworld has a good writeup on how to do this using iTunes or garageband.  Then, in codeSystem Preferences-&gt;Sound-&gt;Sound Effects/code, it will show up as an option for your system alerts.   <answer65187> It is still easy!.

Quicktime Player only seems to offer "Movie" and "Audio" as export types, at least for this file - I had to use iTunes, and followed the instructions from the macworld link above. <comment77696> @Patrix, I'll take a look at my past questions - in general, when an answer is helpful, but doesn't fully solve the problem, I upvote, but don't accept, but I'll see if I've overlooked some accept opportunities. (And I did accept one here.) <comment77701> I updated another way on my Original Answer.
