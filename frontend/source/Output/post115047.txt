How to Record Both Mic Audio and Speakers while using headset <body> I'm trying to record my screen with sound at the same time, but right now, my jack stopped working (it's with the red light) and I have to use a headset so that I can have sound on my Mac.  So my question is: Can I record my screen, my audio input (me babbling) and the supposed audio output that should come from speakers (that now its coming out from my headset).  Is there a way, Or is it just impossible?  <answer131803> I've seen many questions like this. The simple solution is Soundflower. You can download it for free at http://cycling74.com/products/soundflower/. As to where you're recording, you would need to select the Soundflower (2ch) or Soundflower (16ch) as your input.   Input 1 = your microphone's audio/your babblingbr Input 2 = your speakers' output
