Mount and repair external hard drive with command line tools <body> Is it possible to force-mount an external Fujitsu hard drive with command line tools, if it can't be mounted using strongDisk Utility/strong? Whether it doesn't matter? I ask because this is not my Mac and at the moment I don't have it  I have an error message strongthe disk 'name of the disk' could not be mounted/strong  Info: MacBook Pro/OS X Yosemite  Another question: Can I repair this disk through command line tools?  I have an error like this strongexit code 8/strong something with filesystem and error using Disk Utility:     Error: Disk utility canâ€™t repair this disk. backup as many of your files as possible   <answer251116> Yeah, if Disk Utility is telling you it's time to backup and erase then it's not looking good. Perhaps other disk repair utilities can help? But you might just want to heed the warning and backup and erase.  :)  You can force unmount volumes but you can't force mount them. Using the command line, get the device name:  codediskutil list/code  In my case, it's disk2:  codediskutil mountDisk /dev/disk2/code  Or:  codediskutil mount /dev/disk2s2/code  You can run a repair like in Disk Utility, in this case you'll want to include the slice number (disk2s2):  codediskutil repairVolume /dev/disk2s2/code  <comment312054> Please add an error log. There are many reasons why a volume is not mountable: drive corruption, unknown file system, corrupted file system etc.
