Which are the ways to access "Now Playing" in WatchOS 3? <body> I make use of the emNow Playing/em view on Apple Watch to switch between songs playing on my iPhone's Soundcloud app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c62Hv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  However, I haven't yet found a satisfying (fast) way to access this view.  In WatchOS 3, the only way I know of is to click the "Dock" button on the side, and then swipe through the active apps to the location of emNow Playing/em, and then click it. I think it's cumbersome.  I was hoping that there would be a complication to access this view, but for some reason Apple hasn't included one.  There is a emMusic/em complication, and once in that app, there is a "Now Playing" button. But strangely it doesn't seem to be linked to what's playing on my iPhone at the moment, even when I've set the emSource/em to my iPhone. Perhaps this "Now Playing" function is reserved for Apple Music only.  So, my question is, what are the possible ways to access the emNow Playing/em view? Is there something I'm missing?  <answer258340> Update the wake screen setting to show the last used app.  Go to General  Wake Screen  On Screen Wake show Last app on the iPhone App.  You can choose from options include session, 8 minute, 1 hour, always.  Now the watch always wakes up to the now playing screen.
