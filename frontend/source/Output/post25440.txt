What is the best make of RAM I can get for a MBP Mid 2010? <body> I have a MacBookPro bought in October 2010, and is the Mid 2010 model. The mac has suddenly started running pretty slowly as I have been using Xcode and Photoshop excessively. So, due to your previous experiences, please can you tell me the best ram that you can get for my Mac? I am looking to upgrade the 2x2GB to 2x4GB.   This is the RAM I am looking at buying: http://www.crucial.com/uk/store/listparts.aspx?model=MacBook+Pro+2.4GHz+Intel+Core+2+Duo+(13-inch+DDR3)+MC374LL%2fA  <answer25441> tbh pretty much any brand of ram you have will still have samsung chips on the board :P Brand doesn't make ANY difference as long as the timings and frequency are the same. With laptop memory things such as heat dissipation and cooling aren't a concern when buying memory since none of the chips have heat dicipators  <comment28790> I personally had some less than great experience with Crucual more than 5 years ago. Since then people I really respect have nothing but great words for them. Apple RAM is good if you need it to be covered by warranty, but pricey. Since my bad crucial experience, I've gone with RamJET.com and am an extremely happy customer. Pick someone you trust and understand their warranty - support. The good places outnumber the bad. OWC/MacSales and MicroCenter seem to be good as well. <comment28793> Welcome to Ask Different! Questions about hardware recommendations ("let's go shopping") are off-topic for this site.
