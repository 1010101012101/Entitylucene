How am I able to export all of my applications' names on my Mac into a CSV or TXT file? <body> How am I able to export all of my applications' names on my Mac into a CSV or TXT file? I am currently running OS X Yosemite 10.10.3.  <answer182973> In a Terminal:  precodemdfind kMDItemKind="Application" &gt; ~/Desktop/apps.txt /code/pre  This will create a file named codeapps.txt/code on your Desktop, containing the full paths for everything that OS X considers to be an "Application" on your system.   This is might be a lot more than you want. You can limit the search to a given folder by adding code-onlyin &lt;dir&gt;/code, so:  precodemdfind -onlyin /Applications kMDItemKind="Application" &gt; ~/Desktop/apps.txt /code/pre  will limit the search to the code/Applications/code folder (and its subfolders). Note that you might also have apps under code~/Applications/code, i.e., inside your Home folder.  <comment217964> When you say _"all of my applications"_, do you mean in the `/Applications` folder or all executables on the filesystem everywhere? <comment217965> I mean the `/Applications` folder. <comment218041> It is possible to select all of the applications, copy them, then paste into a text file. <comment218118> Interesting approach, thank you.
