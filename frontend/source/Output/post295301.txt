VIP Alert Notification <body> Is there a way to set up VIP Alert Notifications to allow the sound even when my iPhone is on silent? I want to be able to receive notification of VIP emails during the night, but do not want the bother of a notification from someone calling/texting me.  <answer295457> As of iOS 11, you can only allow emphone calls/em from specific contacts through a global silent mode (strongDo Not Disturb/strong).  This is defined under Settings → Do Not Disturb → Allow Calls From.  There is no exception list for emEmails/em or emMessages/em yet, even though this feature has been requested for years.
