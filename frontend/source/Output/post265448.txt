Exclamation point over Airport icon, when connecting to wired base access point - DHCP? <body> I've got a WNDR4500 router connected by LAN to my main Netgear router and acting as a wired base access point (to extend my wifi network).     Its network is seen by MacBook laptops but when I try to connect, I get an exclamation point over the airport wifi signal icon in the menubar.   Have I got a setting wrong?br I currently have it set not to act as a DHCP server; I think maybe that's what the MacBook hates. What is the correct way to set this up so that Apple devices can connect to it?  <comment332954> I'm flagging this for reopen for two reasons... 1. The OP's assumption isn't right [imo] & 2. we have a reasonably good [QA on it already](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/49082/how-do-i-troubleshoot-my-wi-fi-connection-when-an-exclamation-mark-appears), so it would probably be better if we then marked it as a dupe instead. [oh... & 3, it would get me a hat ;))
