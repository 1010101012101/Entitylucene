What could I use to read epub books on OS X? <body> I would prefer a good and free solution for reading codeepub/code books on OS X.   It looks that by default OS X is not able to open epub books.  <answer12653> Stanza is a very good epub reader for OSX that is free.  <answer12655> Calibre  ePubRead Firefox Addon   Crossplatform Sony book reader   Mac OS X Port of FBReader   Adobe Digital Editions  <answer12656> Amazon Kindle for Mac works quite well.  You can download it directly from Amazon, or get it via the Mac App Store.  <answer37737> Scarlett in the Mac App Store.  http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scarlett/id457009670?mt=12  <answer37745> http://calibre-ebook.com/  might be a bit full featured but will do the job.  <answer55544> I use strongCalibre/strong on my desktop machines; it's very feature rich and can convert to and from code.epub/code so you can use it with most of the "specialty" readers. You can even "tweak" your books to fix minor typos and oddities from conversions. I don't think that is up to the normal Mac usability, but it does work.  I've also used the strongKobo/strong reader to read various epubs; it has some nicer page layout than Calibre and allows comments and highlighting that is pretty unique to Kobo.  I'll admit I haven't used it on Mac, but I think it's great on Windows and Android. I'm pretty sure it's strongStanza/strong on my iPad, though.

You're welcome.  <answer96030> Bookle is a native epub viewer for OS X, but its development seems to have stopped at a kind of a beta stage. It doesn't support searching, and I didn't really like the full screen mode or the library model.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UL22N.png" alt=""  I have used calibre's ebook-convert to convert some epub files to plain text:  precode/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert input.epub output.txt /code/pre  <answer284312> Other alternatives:  E-Book Preview, http://macbookreader.com/wp/bookviewer (v.5.7 is the last full-featured free version) Bookreader Free, http://macbookreader.com/wp/  (there's also a paid version) Kitabu, www.kitabu.me Clearview, Canoe Software (App Store)   Stanza was freeware, copies are still lurking on the Internets.   <comment13274> This reads .mobi files not .epub <comment13275> Bah, I forgot that I had to convert them using Calibre. <comment13280> Great list. It's just too bad that Adobe Digital Editions is so horrid. <comment13284> Yeah, considering adobe *should* be peerless for digital media, and yet reader and DE are garbage. <comment64362> Down vote, link doesnt work! <comment93310> Stanza was the best ereader but Amazon bought it and they don't want a epub reader <comment93312> possible duplicate of [Is there a practical ePub book reader program for Mac OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22497/is-there-a-practical-epub-book-reader-program-for-mac-os-x) <comment112724> Are you in some way affiliated? We need to know that. <comment112728> and reading epubs is much better than pdfs as you the user can change the font and the word wrap <comment219600> Calibre doesn't seem to show the content of epub books
