Disable Reminders "due" date <body> Generally, there is no option to set a "due" date and time for a reminder, just a "remind me" date and time.  However, often when I have a reminder and I change the "remind me" time a "due" time appears as so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jVsAi.png" alt="due date"  The "due" date and time does not have a check box like "remind me".  How do I get rid of the due date?  The due date seems to be related to a bug where the reminder keeps notifying me and appearing on my screen before it's supposed to remind me (as per the "remind me" date).  How can I fix this and in general prevent it from happening?  <answer227681> strongQuick Answer/strongbr To remove the strongDue/strong field, simply update it to match your strongAlarm/strong (both day and time).  strongHow To Reproduce/strongbr Add a new scheduled reminder by tapping the empty line at the bottom of today’s strongScheduled/strong list (on iOS). Then instead of tapping strongDone/strong, tap the ⓘ and change the strongAlarm/strong. With a poor connection the strongDue/strong popped up field every time.  strongHow To Keep This From Happening/strongbr Tap strongDone/strong (in the upper right corner, under the alarm clock graphic) after creating a new reminder. Then wait for the network activity indicator (next to your network symbol) to stop spinning before setting a new strongAlarm/strong. The reminder should have shifted into its correct, sorted position by then.  I have to wonder what the purpose of this strongDue/strong field is, since there isn’t a way for the user to set it directly. It seems like something that’s used internally by iOS and macOS that’s never supposed to be exposed to the user.  It is worth noting that the web app at iCloud.com used to have a checkbox to add the strongDue/strong field. It has since been retired, though it is still accessible via AppleScript.  <comment273256> Have you tried checking `On a Day` then unchecking it? I’ve seen the `due date` before, and it usually resulted from moving a repeating reminder that was past due, although it’s difficult to reproduce. <comment273265> @Phong it is difficult to reproduce.  My current workaround is to simply delete the reminder and recreate it.  I might have tried your solution but I'll double check when it happens again to see if it works. <comment277456> @Phong this happened again and I tried checking *On a Day* and unchecking it several times to no avail.  I even tried checking the box and clicking *Done* but that also did nothing, as did changing both dates (the "remind me" date and the "due" date). <comment277508> It just so happens that it happened to me today as well. I will post my workaround as an answer. <comment278265> I confirmed this behavior with my own device.  This workaround *is* what I asked for, although it's such a hassle to set the new date I might just go back to removing and re-adding reminders.  Maybe.  Thanks. <comment350833> I have noticed some apps that sync with Reminders deliberately add the Due Date field to reminders they create, which suggests that the Due Date field is not an internal piece of Reminders being inadvertently exposed. It seems more like a forgotten (or merely unused by Apple) piece of the Reminders API.
