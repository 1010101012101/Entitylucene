Set default input/output sound <body> I have a mac that is hooked into a sound board, I have external sound card that interfaces between the computer and the soundboard, this works great.  However, whenever the computer restarts it sets the input &amp; output to the 'internal microphone' and the 'built in output'.  I'd like to default to the other soundcard. How can I do this?  I'm running OS 10.6.3  <answer3787> I use SoundSource (Freeware) to set my output/inputs and they persist (I have a Firewire Audio Interface and a M-Audio Pro USB).   What sound board do you have?  Why are you running 10.6.3 and not .4?  <comment3573> sorry, I originally posted this question on SuperUser and didn't receive any answers and came across this stackexchange site and copied the question over. I am probably on .4 (I've been updating regularly) but I cannot verify as the computer is not at my office. <comment3574> My soundboard is a Yamaha MG32-14FX <comment3628> @Nathan Have you tried setting the output/input with SoundForce? do you still experience the same issue? <comment11071> I've tried SoundSource several times now, it doesn't persist for me on 10.6.4, 10.6.5 or 10.6.6.
