Remotely working on iMac, but with screen darkened <body> I have my main iMac in my kids room (little house, alas) and often I have to work late at night; I'd like to connect from my MacBook to the iMac keeping the screen black, as in sleep mode. Is there any sort of magic to achieve this? What if I plug a Mini DisplayPort cable? Will it exclude the monitor? Thanks, Guido  <answer37534> You might be overlooking a simpler solution: throw a sheet/blanket/whatever over the display before you walk out of the room.  <answer37742> Lion has the ability to do a virtual desktop from one mac to another. Maybe the following works:  ul liCreate a second user account on the iMac, with 'sleep display' properties set./li liMake that account the active account on the iMac, and wait for it to go to sleep./li liThen use share screen on the MacBook to connect with a virtual desktop to your own account on the iMac./li /ul  I am not sure the iMac won't wake up when you virtually connect to it, but it's worth a try.  <comment42585> My iMac has a ventilation slot on the back near the top. This should not be covered or the machine could overheat. <comment42586> If you use Apple Remote Desktop tools, it is possible to lock the screen, displaying a static image over a black screen, while working on it remotely. Someone may be able to hack together a solution for you that kicks off this screen lock process while you connect with Screen Sharing, but personally I'm a fan of EmmEff's solution. <comment42588> Unfounded worry, IMHO, but if one is that worried, it'd be easy enough to fabricate some sort of physical screen blocking apparatus that does not block the port. <comment42591> Fair enough; the current iMac user guide does not warn against blocking the ventilation openings, although that is still my advice! <comment42595> Further to that, I cannot imagine a common bed sheet would completely block the ventilation port enough to make any significant difference.
