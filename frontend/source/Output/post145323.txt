Is it safe to wipe off iPhone screen with a wet wipe? <body> I am wondering if cleaning an iPhone screen with a wet wipe could have any negative impact on the touch-sensitivity of the screen.  <answer145328> I would not use a wet one, but damp.   With wet you might crate drops that can sneek in in places they should not.
