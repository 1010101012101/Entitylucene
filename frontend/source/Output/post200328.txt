Is there a way to either save/copy/or email an entire iMessage conversation? <body> Is there a one (or a simple) step process to either email myself, or cut/copy, an entire (like year long) iMessage conversation without having to buy an app/software or to go through and keep marking post groupings through "more" so I can send to my email?  I read about finding a hidden library folder in the question pertaining to the bulk download of pictures in iMessage. This did not really help.  Also, when I log into iMessage from my Macbook, my iPhone messages that predated the purchase do not show up. Even assuming it did, however, I still want to move the conversation out of iMessage so I can paste it into a word doc for posterity.  <answer200340> ol liSign in to Messages on OS X/li liSelect the conversation you want to save/li liFile - Print - Save /li li(optional) Use whatever pdf editing software you choose to extract, copy, transform the PDF version of the conversation/li /ol  <comment241393> possible duplicate of [Bulk Download Pictures from Messages](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191869/bulk-download-pictures-from-messages) <comment241394> You may want to check out this thread, which goes over downloading entire iMessage conversations (and photos) to the computer, broken out by date. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191869/bulk-download-pictures-from-messages/191874#191874 <comment241397> I tried this and it did not work. I think that was more geared toward photos where I want to preserve the text in a document format. <comment241400> possible duplicate of [How to back up my text messages from iPhone to computer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/194990/how-to-back-up-my-text-messages-from-iphone-to-computer) <comment241401> @gracey209 in the linked method, while the title is for how to save images, the HTML files that it also produces in the _export folder contain the conversations themselves :) <comment241427> Its on my iPhone not my Macbook. Although it is an iMessage it is not showing up on the OS X, I think (?) because I bought the Macbook after the last text was sent/rec'd. <comment241435> @gracey209 I've had a newly wiped or set up mac download lots of past iMessage history. Hopefully this works for you if you set up a new user account. <comment241541> I think I was doing it wrong. I read the article linked to a comment and It has a different way of doing it than I have tried. Thanks <comment241543> But the iMessage conversation is on my phone and all that shows on iMessage on my Macbook are messages sent/rec'd after I set this machine up. I have no access to my phone's old messages. I am going to connect my phone again to my Macbook and try to capture it a different way. I'm clueless I think!
