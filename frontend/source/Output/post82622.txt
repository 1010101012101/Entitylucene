My cursor on my Macbook Pro has a box around it that enlarges everything <body> One day I was surfing the web when suddenly a large clear square appeared around my cursor!  I honestly don't know what to do about it, but it seems like there could be a simple fix.  You can see in the picture below what the box around my cursor looks like compared to the normal screen.  Is there something I can reset or do to clear the box that encircles my cursor?  <answer82623> Could this be the Zoom accessibility feature?  It can be toggled with Alt-Command-8.  Also see System Preferences = Accessibility = Zoom for more details and options.  <answer82624> As Thilo said it is probably an accessibility feature, to expand a bit go to accessibility in system preferences, select zoom, towards the bottom is zoom style, make sure it is set to full screen not picture-in-a-picture.  <comment95311> Would you mind uploading the screen shot to another hosting provider and then linking to it here? Flag the post, or ping me, and we will edit the picture in. <comment95313> You are likely right. This would make sense if the "Zoom style" was set to "Picture in Picture". I'm hoping the OP will post screen shots as that would show us for sure. <comment95332> Thank you! The box has been removed from the cursor. Thank you for your help. :)
