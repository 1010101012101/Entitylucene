Do Not Disturb keeps enabling itself on my Mac <body> Do Not Disturb on my Mac keeps enabling itself at midnight or after every reboot even though I do not have it scheduled. As you can see from the screenshot below, DND is not enabled at all. What could be causing DND to automatically enable? I am running El Capitan  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/35l9H.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment301506> I've seen this happen when you have DND on another i-device and both are signed-in with the same Apple ID. Is that the case here? <comment301513> Sounds like a corrupted .plist file or cache to me. I'm too busy to hunt down the file where those would be stored right now, but maybe someone else can elaborate on this. <comment301514> I opened `com.apple.notificationcenterui.guid.plist` and set `dndEnd` and `dndStart` to zero. When I reboot, DND is no longer enabled
