One Time Machine server on two different addresses <body> I have a netatalk based Time Machine server set up at home. Right now, it is accessible only from my local home network. It only allows me to do backup, when I am at home. Sometimes, I'd like to access the Time Machine drive from outside home. I can connect to the server via ssh and forward the necessary port (548) via ssh tunnel. This way I know, that the connection is secure. Unfortunately, I cannot get it to work properly.  After setting up tunnel with codessh -L 8890:localhost:548 server/code I go into Finder and try to connect to custom server codeafp://localhost:8890/code. The connection is successful and I can see my time machine drive. I cannot mount it tough. I can select it in Time Machine settings as backup drive, but I cannot backup anything to it.    Future solution is to create vpn and connect to this netatalk server via vpn. How can I tunnel this via ssh?    Additional question, that came to my mind is, how well protected is afp. Is this encrypted? Could I just forward the ports to my backup netatalk server to outside world and live happily?
