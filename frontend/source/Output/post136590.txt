How can I delete a partition (coreStorage logical volume?) from the Terminal? <body> I finally understood why Disk Utility will not change the partitions on my HDD, even though I added the most recent one myself (maybe significant: to test Yosemite DP) with it. Now I see it says it won't change either partition, because it has encrypted data and CoreStorage objects. It tells me vaguely to use codediskutil/code from the command line for this, but this makes me a bit uncomfortable. I found a very similar question here,  with a great but incomplete answer about how to resolve this. How can one drop the smaller partition, then?  Note that I don't even see my pain partition from codediskutil corestorage list/code (output below), which is worrisome.  Also note (also in the older question) that the name of the disk is unstable, sometimes Disk Utility lists my original, old name for the disk (Toshiba…), sometimes the name of the new, smaller partition. Note that I made these partitions from within Mavericks, not Yosemite. Why would Yosemite mess with this?

If force is not given, and the first partition has a resizable file system (e.g. JHFS+), the                 file system will be preserved and grown in a data-preserving manner; your format and name                 parameters are ignored in this case. /code/pre  Verify the boot Volume structure.   precodediskUtil VerifyVolume / /code/pre  Verify the partition map:  precodediskutil verifyDisk disk0 /code/pre  Boot into Recovery Mode, or Internet Recovery if needed -- if any errors appear:  You emshould/em be left with:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *320.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            319.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  <answer141279> I know this is an old article, but this recently happened to me and the easiest way to get rid of the Yosemite partition is to:  ol liBoot your other OS, mine was Mavericks/li liOpen Disk Utility/li liSelect the Yosemite partition/li liSelect the erase tab, erase it, /li liSelect the main drive and go to the partition tab, where you can then delete the Yosemite partition and resize it back to the original size./li /ol  <answer192509> ran into the same problem and found this article that fixes it a little easier   Just run diskutil coreStorage list, find the logical volume uuid,  and then run diskutil coreStorage revert (that uuid)  in your case diskutil coreStorage revert 2F7B1893-07E8-4194-840B-F2552042E055  http://awesometoast.com/yosemite-core-storage-and-partition-woes/  <comment162080> Can you please update your post with the output of the following command: `diskutil list; echo; diskutil cs list` <comment162113> This is a great answer. I am a bit hesitant to try it (or to buy a large external HDD and spend a day backing up just to try this — my online backup is on Amazon AWS with Arq, but not the entire disk). But I will see what I can do and accept your answer, or maybe even sooner if others say it solved the same problem for them. Thanks! <comment162115> @László You're welcome. I just tested this on a spare boot drive to confirm, but as I said, I would not ever do this on my main volume without an up to date backup (or two!). You should always have a backup my friend, no matter what! [These Toshiba drives are excellent - I use them all the time](http://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Portable-Hard-Drive/dp/B005J7YA3W) BOL. Cheers. <comment162274> This basically worked, things look great – apart from the fact that both of my Recover HDs are now gone. How big a problem is that? Why did that happen? Shall I fix this somehow? How? Thanks again! <comment162318> @László that shouldn't have happened. I don't know why it did. It's not a big problem, but I recommend fixing it. To do so, boot into [Internet Recovery](https://www.apple.com/osx/recovery/) and reinstall OS X. All your data will be preserved. A fresh recovery partition will be automatically created during the installation. <comment167865> This is exactly what was supposed to work but did not, thus the original question. But thanks! <comment177586> Thanks for this. I used the first two commands to delete the partition, but since I was a bit wary of using mergePartitions, I went to Disk Utility after that. The Partitions tab was no longer greyed out, and I could take it from there (delete "unused space"/orphan partition, resize disk, add new partition.) <comment177850> I tried this, and it appears to have wiped my drive. This may be related to the fact that I had FileVault enabled. Do you know if it is in fact wiped, or is there a way to use diskutil to recover my boot partition? (Don't worry, I have backups. Didn't lose anything; just curious.) <comment177889> @ZevEisenberg if the drive is wiped, for all practical purpose...(given you have a backup) it’s wiped. i assume you confirmed in in recovery or the like. Your best bet is to restore from the TM backup to the previous state. SIDENOTE: From my experience in upgrading, Yosemite appears to be creating LVG on the drive despite NOT selecting encrypt disk on startup. I was able to remove the LVG using the `revert` option is diskutil. Obviously, this requires a volume that was not encrypted beforehand. BOL. <comment221335> I had a corrupt Fusion Drive partition which Disk Utility refused to reformat. I followed the first two steps of this procedure (with the difference that because I rebooted with a recovery drive I couldn't use `sudo` and the distil command was `diskutil unmountDisk`). I couldn't do the mergePartitions command because the partitions are on different physical disks, but when I switched back to Disk Utility it automatically recognized the deleted LVG and offered to rebuild the Fusion Drive. Success! Thanks for getting me on the right track. <comment258734> How long did it take to destroy the LVG? I am on the 3TB Fusion Drive on a first gen 5k iMac.
