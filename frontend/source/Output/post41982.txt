Change iBooks Author study card behavior? <body> So when you're reading an iBook made using iBooks Author, and you go to highlight something, you're able to use that as a study card along with a note of your own creation that you annotate with the highlight.  My problem is this: The first thing you see when you open the study cards is the highlighted text itself, not the note you've added with it. This I see as an oversight due to the fact that logically speaking, when you highlight something, you're not highlighting a question, you're highlighting an emanswer/em.  Is there any way to change what displays initially when you run the study card feature, either in iBooks Author when you're creating the iBook, or in iBooks itself?
