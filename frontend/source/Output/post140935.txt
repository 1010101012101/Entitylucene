How do you sync iPhone 5 with macbook to import iMovies? <body> I tried to contact Apple for support since I just bought iMovie for my iPhone 5.  They just shut me down, no response.  I figure it was because my macbook is an older model and out of warranty.  I can get my movie clips to show up in iMovie on my macbook.  How do I get the new movies I made on my iPhone into my macbook for editing and filing?   <answer140945> iMovie for Mac and iMovie for iPhone are unfortunately two separate and incompatible tools. You simply won't be able to transfer the iMovie projects to iMovie on Mac.
