is there Dictionary app on iphone that can translate word printed on real paper? <body> Is there any Dictionary app act like this:br 1.capturing the image of the word on the book by its camerabr 2.converting the image of the word to text,and show its meaning in other languages    <answer14123> Yes, application is called Word Lens, and the technology behind it is darn impressive :) Have a look at the video presentation.br But it only works for translations from english to spanish (and vice-versa). Supposedly more languages to come but no progress since it launched.
