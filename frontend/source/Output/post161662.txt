Can you set own prices when selling music on iTunes? <body> Can you set your own track/album prices when selling music on iTunes?  I was able to find answers on several forums (not on Apple's website/KBs), but they were contradictory (some say that it's $0.99 automatically, some that you can choose the price).  Can someone clarify the pricing parameters an artist can use on the iTunes store?  <answer162693> Check this info in official Apple site.This &amp; this interesting sources. I think it could help.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ETl8T.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you already have an account with iTunes for music distribution, you can review your pricing options in the legal documents by logging in to https://itunesconnect.apple.com/ and then selecting Agreements, Tax, and Banking - if you don't have a selling account, you can apply and if accepted, you will get to review the legal agreements and then decide to proceed with signing them if you wish.  ul lihttps://www.apple.com/itunes/working-itunes/sell-content/music-faq.html/li /ul  <comment190458> @bmike - thanks for adding information.
