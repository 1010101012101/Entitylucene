How to delete Google apps from my launchpad? <body> After I have downloaded Google Chrome because my Safari wasn't finding servers, multiple google apps appeared on my launchpad that I can't delete. I uploaded a picture so you understand what I'm talking about: http://i.imgur.com/KWy1yFV.png  When I click on them, they open and instantly close.
