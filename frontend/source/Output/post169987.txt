App Store doesn't fetch updates anymore <body> I'm on a MacBook Pro, mid 2009, OS X 10.10.  An update to Yosemite (10.10.2) came out five days ago, but going to the Updates tab in App Store only returns a dialog box with the following message:  precodeAn error has occurred Can't connect to the Apple Software Update server. /code/pre  I have turned off Firewall, logged out/in from App Store, removed App Store cookies - but despite this and after googling over an hour I'm still clueless.   Any ideas what could be the problem?  <answer169998> There are a couple of empossible/em solutions here:  ol liRepair permissions and retry./li /ol  If it won't work:  ol start="2" liDelete (consider doing a backup before) your code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist/code and code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist/code files and try again./li /ol  <answer233492> If I wanted to troubleshoot this - I would do the following:  ol liMake a new admin account on the Mac and restart./li liLog in to the new account (you might have to disable auto login for the old account)/li liOpen Console.app and look over two log files  ul li/var/log/install.log/li li/var/log/commerce.log/li /ul/li liOpen System Preferences (while watching the logs above) and unselect all of the App Store options. Turn off "Automatically check for updates"/li liRun the App Store App - click Purchases - sign in to the App Store./li /ol  At this point you should have dozens of log fie entries that may point to a network error, a certificate error, an account error or perhaps a permissions problem.  The App Store app is basically a web browser that runs some code, interacts with several servers and needs date/time/encryption certificates to be correct to function properly.  You also might consider installing a clean OS onto a USB drive to boot to it and do the tests if you have any security/firewall software you don't want to uninstall / disable on the main Mac OS.
