Unable to determine meaning of status bar icon <body> I have a status bar icon that does nothing when you click on it. I have no idea what it does or what it means, it just appeared one day.  Does anyone have any ideas on its meaning?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfZSE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment329806> Really interesting! If you have Xcode installed, you could use the Accessibility Inspector which will tell you what it is. Otherwise, you could download the trial for Bartender (https://www.macbartender.com) and look in its preferences to see what it is. <comment329807> Take a screenshot and add it to your question, maybe someone will recognize it. <comment329808> There's already a screenshot.
