Can read mail on iPhone but not on computer <body> I can check mail on my Phone because the password was inputted when set up.  After a while I forgot it and cannot check mail on my computer!  I tried to retrieve it by using the "I forgot ..," but after many tries, not successful.  How can I find out the password that I "saved" in my iPhone ?  <answer140390> You cannot. Use iforgot password technique to set a new password.  <comment165485> There's no way you can read it as plain text.
