Showing the road speed limit on iPhone <body> I am looking for an iOS application that can display the speed limit of the road where I am located. I am mostly interested in the USA, particularly Boston and California. Gratis is better but not necessary.  <comment195420> Here in CA if they catch you looking at your iPhone screen while driving it is $300 :) <comment195440> Do they still also have that silly rule whereby you're allowed to have a sat nav, but can't stick it to your windscreen & instead have to sit it on some kind of bean-bag that falls off the dash every time you go round a corner - which of course is *far* less distracting than just sticking it to the screen in the first place? :P <comment195441> [Navfree](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navfree-gps-usa-+-street-view/id405922167?mt=8) though apparently it doesn't have all speed limits, depends on the underlying open streetmap
