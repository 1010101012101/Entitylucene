how can I add command line parameters to an application shortcut <body> Chromium has command line flags.  I'd like to use them, but I'd like to put them on the shortcut, since I tend to launch Chromium via spotlight.  Is this possible?  <answer8109> Make an Automator app called "ChromiumLauncher" that runs the commands you want. Drawback is you will get the ChromiumLauncher bouncing in your Dock for a second or two before it goes away.  <answer8115> It will launch faster if you cut out Automator and just do it with Applescript (and then save that applescript as an application bundle).  Here's an example:   precodedo shell script "open /Applications/Chromium.app --args --enable-expose-for-tabs" /code/pre  <comment8744> Automator!  Why do I keep forgetting about that thing? <comment8778> +1 Good to know. Didn't know AppleScript could make Apps.
