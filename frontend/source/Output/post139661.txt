Where can I find this iPad mini wallpaper used in Apple's advert? <body> Can somebody help me find this wallpaper (image taken from http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/). I've looked all over the internet but couldn't find it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjTXs.jpg" alt=""  <answer139662> One way it could be done is to take the image you posted, and using Photoshop or other graphics editing app, magic-wand select the image on the iPad, copy and paste into its own layer, select it again and use the Edit menu Transform  Skew to square the corners. Then save the now relatively rectangular image as a JPG or whatever and use that as your background pic.  OR  Go to Google images and click on the camera icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3oux.png" alt="enter image description here"  Upload the file, and see what google finds for you. With luck, you'll find a hi-res royalty-free image.  <answer139669> Apple sourced this image from Robbie George Photography. It's called "Lake Mattamuskeet", you'll find it on his page.   <comment164622> Thank you! :-) Was trying to find it at least for a week but couldn't. <comment164668> The asker is not reproducing the image created by Robbie George. The asker is correctly attributing the Apple advertisement featuring an image by Robbie George, which makes it a derivative work. As such the question is Fair Use. The answerer also provides a link to the original creatorâ€™s site, citing the title. It is no different than a shopper asking another customer where to find a half-remembered brand of a product on the shelf of a grocery store.
