How to export conversation history from Microsoft Communicator for Mac (2011)? <body> Got a new Mac &amp; trying to move my stuff from old Mac. I am unable to find a way to move the conversation history of Microsoft Communicator 2011 (version 13.1.2) from old Mac.  <answer119583> After running this command,   precodefind ~ -type f -exec grep "special search string" {} \; -print /code/pre  I was able to find the Conversation history at  precode/Users/&lt;my_mac_user_id&gt;/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Microsoft Communicator History/&lt;my_communicator_login_id&gt; /code/pre  Just copying the entire folder to new mac solved my problem.  "special search string" is an unique string you would have used while chatting with your friends/colleagues.
