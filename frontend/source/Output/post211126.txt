OSX and 2-Factor Authentication with Google Authenticator PAM <body> So I'd like to enable 2-Factor Authentication in OSX Yosemite. In Ubuntu I was able to do it using the google authenticator pam module (pam_google_authenticator.so).   I was able to build the module without an issue, and I placed it in /usr/lib/pam and modified /etc/pam.d/authorization and /etc/pam.d/screensaver with the line  precodeauth       required       pam_google_authorization.so nullok /code/pre  I was still able to login to my account ok, and then i ran google-authenticator to generate the secret, and added it to my google authenticator app. tried logging in, but no luck.  Just wondering if anybody here might have any experience in this/know where I can ask.  In system.log i get the following error(s):  precodeOct 15 17:32:23 Mac-b888e39a59cc authorization(pam_google_authenticator)[1180]: Did not receive verification code from user Oct 15 17:32:23 Mac-b888e39a59cc authorization(pam_google_authenticator)[1180]: Invalid verification code Oct 15 17:32:23 Mac-b888e39a59cc authorizationhost[1180]: in _openpam_check_error_code(): pam_sm_authenticate(): unexpected return value 19 /code/pre  Here's the 2 guides I adapted my method from:  Using Google 2-Factor Authentication for Ubuntu  MacOS X Challenge-Response  Has anybody successfully done this before, or know of another way besides the "bluetooth + iOS App" solutions?
