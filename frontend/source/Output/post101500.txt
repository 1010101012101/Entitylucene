iPhone Passcode for Powering Off <body> I am looking for an option to require a passcode to power off my iPhone. That way, if the phone is lost, the person who finds it cannot simply turn it off, rendering codeFind My iPhone/code useless. Is there a way to accomplish this?  <answer101502> In the current OS, this isn't possible. However, there is a jailbreak mod that will accomplish this functionality called PowerGuard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HCafS.png" alt="enter image description here"
