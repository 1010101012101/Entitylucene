How can I activate an iPhone 5s locked to another person's iCloud account? <body> I bought a used iPhone 5s and unknowing to me it is locked to an iCloud account with a gmail address (p*****@gmail.com). I formatted the iPhone and upon activating it the iCloud prompt appears and frankly speaking I can't trace the old user of the phone. Please what can I do to activate it because i don't have a clue where the previous owner lives. Please help me because I used my savings to purchase the phone.  <answer177986> Sorry but there isn't a way to remove the previous activation without the previous owners iCloud details. That would defeat the purpose of these anti-theft measures.  Apple provide instructions here on how to remove the activation lock. You will need to contact the previous owner. Please speak to whoever you bought the iPhone from.
