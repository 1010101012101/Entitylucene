Can I change the application icon of an Automator script? <body> I have created a couple of automator scripts. I was curios if there is a way to change the application icon, on those scripts, to something other than the robot.  <answer370> I found a hacky way to do it after you have created the applet  ul li(Create your icns icon file - however you want)/li liOpen Applications Folder/li liRight-click on automator script/li liClick on view package contents/li liAdd your icon to resources folder/li liRename it to AutomatorApplet.icns/li /ul  I am sure there is a better way, but I figured out how to do it this way.  <answer372> After the script has been created do the following :  ol liFind the strongsource app/strong with the icon you want/li liemGet Info/em of the strongsource app/strong (kbdcmd/kbd-kbdi/kbd)/li liClick on the icon inside the strongsource app's/strong info window (Not the one in the big Preview section at the bottom, if you have one of those; the little one in the top-left corner.)/li liCopy it (kbdcmd/kbd-kbdc/kbd)/li liemGet Info/em of the automator script (i.e., the strongdestination app/strong) (kbdcmd/kbd-kbdi/kbd)/li liClick on the icon inside the strongdestination app's/strong info window/li liPaste the icon from the clipboard (kbdcmd/kbd-kbdv/kbd)/li /ol  This method works for every files in Mac OS X.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bo9w5.jpg" alt="picture to illustrate instructions"  <answer373> You can also change the icon just as you would normally for any other folder or file in Mac OS X:  ol liCopy the image you want to use as your icon. Ideally it should be 512x512 already./li liChoose Get Info on the file/folder/app in Finder/li liClick on the Icon and you'll notice a blue outline on the icon - now press kbdCommand/kbd-kbdV/kbd or choose Paste from the Edit menu./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZDIrL.png" alt="Example"  (Screenshot taken from Super User question 37811)  <answer198717> To complement the existing, helpful answers:  ul liThe accepted answer works in principle, but:  ul listrongrelies on extended attributes of the HFS+ filesystem, which are lost when copying the bundle to a filesystem that doesn't support them/strong. For instance, you cannot store a custom icon in a Git repository./li lithe strongicon displayed by the bundle emitself/em/strong, such as when showing an alert, is still the strongemoriginal/em icon/strong./li /ul/li lipercent 20's answer is strongmore comprehensive and portable in principle/strong, but comes with strongtwo caveats/strong:  ul liAny strongchanges to codeAutomatorApplet.icns/code are lost whenever you modify and re-save the bundle/strong in Automator.br Thus, for instance, you'd need a script to put the updated icons in place programmatically every time the bundle is saved./li liAs others have noted, there are strongicon caching issues/strong, which can be tricky to resolve; as of OSX 10.10.4:  ul liEven a reboot doesn't make the new icons appear in Finder (though it does appear in other contexts such as in the Dock), but there are two strongworkarounds/strong: either (a) move the bundle to a different folder, or (b) rename the bundle; given that reverting to the original path and name makes the problem reappear, you'd have to plan ahead: create your bundle in a different location or with a different name, then move / rename to the desired location / name./li liAlternatively, you can use a tool such as OnyX and check codeIconServices/codeunder codeCleaning &gt; User/code to clear the cache./li /ul/li /ul/li /ul  <comment339> +1 for your brief and complete explanation, but if you add some image it's become better. <comment342> I like this solution better. Much less hassle. <comment150094> This is the way I think it should work, but for some reason, it is not working for me. I am OS X 10.9.2, and after replace the icns file, I have already try to log off and log in again, still not helps. <comment159805> That doesn't do anything. There's no action when i type the cmd-c or cmd-v. <comment166417> This does not behave as it should in Mavericks <comment166419> For a visual demo, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1WMoisK6Rs <comment169553> @qed I also thought it wasn't working in Mavericks, but then realized to copy and paste the little icon at the very top of the Get Info window, not the one in the Preview section... Studer might want to update step 3 to indicate which icon to focus on. <comment187551> I just got percent20's method to work by adding one more operation: 1. Follow the "hacky way to do it" process above 2. Close the app bundle and once again do a Cmd+I Get Info on the app icon 3. *Delete* the current (now legacy) icon in the Get Info sheet 4. The icon in the .icns file you inserted in 1. above will appear. S <comment193809> I tested this answer on OS X Mavericks (`10.9.5`) and it worked... after a reboot!  Seems there is some icon caching going on that a reboot must clear up.  I didn't need to follow @SimonPride's additional steps above. <comment269264> still working on El Capitan too, supertip, thanks! <comment350198> You can paste **any** image from anywhere. <comment350210> [Platypus](https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus) (`brew cask install platypus`) is simpler than Automator, offers more options, including setting a **proper icon**, and is open source. You can create a launcher with it without writing any applescript code. E.g. it took a couple of minutes to make an mpv launcher that accepts files via drag-n-drop.
