Can't select Time Capsule disk in Time Machine when trying to do first backup on Ethernet <body> I can't figure why I can't select the Time Capsule disk in Time Machine when trying to do the first backup using Ethernet.   Tried updating the TC to 7.7.8.  Tried doing the backup with Ethernet cable between TC and Mac but with wifi off as well as on. When wifi on I tried while being connected to the TC or not. Still not working.   I recently installed a 3rd-party SSD, enabled TRIM and did a fresh install of Sierra as well as recent Mac OS and other Apple updates.   I didn't connect the TC to my internet router.  I just want to use the TC on its own Wifi, without it ever being connected to the internet.   Thanks for any help you can give me.
