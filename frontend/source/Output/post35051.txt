Is there a way to sort audio by file name in the music app on iOS 5? <body> I got an MP3 audiobook download for Christmas.  The downloaded and unzipped files are named in this manner:  ul li01 Prologue.mp3/li li02 Chapter 1 - Don't start yappin.mp3  /li li03 Chapter 2 - Stack  Exchangin your way to success.mp3/li li04 Chapter 3 - Don't eat that Unicorn meat and three other warnings.mp3/li li05 Epilogue.mp3/li /ul  After syncing them to my iPhone and opening the music app I saw that they are displayed in alphabetical order by title:  ul liDon't eat that Unicorn meat and three other warnings. /li liDon't start yappin'! /li liEpilogue/li liStack  Exchangin' your way to success./li liPrologue/li /ul  Listening in the order they're presented in while I'm driving is bizarre. Is there a way to sort audio by file name in the music app on iOS 5?  <answer35052> Have you tried setting the strongtrack number/strong in iTunes and then syncing again?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L6gKg.jpg" alt="itunes get info" title="it&#39;s from Google Images, don&#39;t blame me for the song ;)"  <answer35061> While not actually answering your question, do yourself a favor and select all the files for your audio book, Right-click one of them and choose 'Get Info' opening a dialog, similar to that in Lo√Øc Wolff's answer;  Click the 'Options' category, and change the Media Kind to 'Audiobook'.  Only when something is classified as an Audiobook will you get features such as resuming mid-file. Music will always start from the beginning when you re-select it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ZuVJ.png" alt="iTunes Get Info Dialog, Choosing Audiobook as Media Kind"  <answer71220> I was frustrated by this as well and ended up writing a simple script for just this task using Ruby (which comes pre-installed on MacOS and is available on all OSes) with the taglib library. If you're a little programming savvy, just plug in the directory where the files are into the "mydir" variable and save this script (say as  "rename_audio_title_to_filename.rb" ). After running it, the filenames will match the title tag and when you drag them them into Itunes playlists, they will be sorted correctly.  You can also change the mp3 to other file formats that are supported.  pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"code#! /usr/bin/env ruby  require 'taglib'  mydir = "/path/to/my/audio/files"  Dir.glob "#{mydir}/*mp3" do |filename|   TagLib::FileRef.open( filename ) do |fileref|     tag = fileref.tag      puts "The title is #{tag.title} and will become #{File.basename(filename)}"     tag.title =  File.basename(filename)     fileref.save   end  end /code/pre  Then just run it:   pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"coderuby rename_audio_title_to_filename.rb /code/pre  <comment39933> Have you tried setting the **track number** in iTunes and then syncing again? <comment39948> +1 For the chapter titles alone. <comment39950> This is great advice, thank you. <comment257842> Actually what would be cool is a script that will parse the track number from the file name and insert it as the Track Number on the metadata... <comment257844> So it seems you have to do this manually, one file at a time....  kinda annoying....  but at least it works!  :)
