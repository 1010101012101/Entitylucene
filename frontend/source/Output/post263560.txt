Iphone 6 won't leave the charging icon <body> I'll plug my iphone 6 with its adapter and cable to the wall and it would show the charging icon for 30 minutes (the longest I've waited until I asked this question).   The steps I did:   Connected iphone to my laptop  Held down power and home button for 20 seconds   ul listill showed the battery and cable icon on the screen. The itunes icon didn't pop up. /li /ul  Let go of the power button and held the home button, still no change  Thought I'd disconnect cable from the laptop and connect it to the adapter while still holding the home button = no change   So my phone has been dead for like 3 hours with no progress, but only showing the charging battery icon, but no actual charging happening.   Recently, I had my screen replaced at whole accessories and noticed that this problem has been happening after I got my screen fixed.  If I call them and it turns out to be their fault, how should I go about this situation? Could I get it done for free? I don't know how this goes.   I tried all methods, but nothing seems to be working, What should I do?
