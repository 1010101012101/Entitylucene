How to get deleted device list from Apple developer account? <body> While reseting the device list, mistakenly I have selected those device which I suppose to remove and removed those devices which I suppose to keep. Now how can I get that device list which I have removed from developer account?  <answer100771> Contact Apple Care about this. From a recent question I understood that they keep this information for a emvery/em long time.  They had a track for me of an iMac DV which I don't own anymore sinceâ€¦ (imagine the spinning beach balloon starting here).
