OS X 10.8 hosts file completely ignoring new entries. Help! <body> I have a hosts file that I've added a couple URLs to a while back and it's been working fine, but any new entries now get completely ignored. I've added these to test it...  codegoogle.com      test-domain.com/code  codegoogle.com      www.test-domain.com/code  And I've read through a bunch of posts about this issue. It makes no difference if I put them at the top or the bottom of the file, nor if I follow the entries with 2 carriage returns.  I'm totally at a loss. Any ideas?  <answer96452> As far as I'm aware, the code/etc/hosts/code file on UNIX systems is intended to map IP addresses to hostnames and vice-versa. You have not added IP address information for these hosts.  See the man page for more information by typing the following at the command line:  precodeman 5 hosts /code/pre  You haven't specified how you are attempting to use this file or the records inside of it, so it's hard to say why it was working previously.  <comment113233> You can't enter those values. That's not how the hosts file works. You need to direct an ip to a domain. You can't redirect based on domains. So you'll need to enter 127.0.0.1 test-domain.com to have 127.0.0.1 as the routable address when test-domain.com is entered into a browser (or other).
