There is not a GO button in the menu bar <body> Any idea how to add a GO button to my menu bar to the MAC PRO? Menu bar I have contains:  Safari  File  Edit  View  History  Bookmarks Window  Help     NO "GO" Bar    <answer256177> Start Finder: then the menu bar reads: Finder File Edit View GO Window Help. It is a Finder menu not Safari menu that has GO.  <comment319360> 'Go' is a Finder menu, not Safari. Click the desktop then look again.
