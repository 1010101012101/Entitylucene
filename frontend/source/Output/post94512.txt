Automator Service with Google Translate <body> I set up an Automator Service that receives selected text and then runs a simple shell script to pass the text to open google translate:  precodeopen https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/"$@" /code/pre  It opens google translate just fine, but doesn't pass the text along with it. How can I fix?  google translate service  <answer94515> It worked for me as long as pass input was set to as arguments. You could try restarting or creating a new identical service like that.  You have to URL encode the input though:  precodeopen https://translate.google.com/#auto/auto/$(ruby -rcgi -e 'print CGI.escape(STDIN.read)') /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0FgBN.png" alt=""  Or if you don't want to use ruby:  precodexxd -p | tr -d '\n' | sed 's/\(..\)/%\1/g' /code/pre
