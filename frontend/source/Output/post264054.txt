My external monitor quit working, and it doesn't show up in System Preferences <body> I have an HP external monitor that was working fine, but I turned it off, and when I logged in, the external monitor wasn't working. How can I troubleshoot this?  FACTS:  (1) All the connections are tight.  (2) When I turn the external monitor on &amp; off it display "no signal."  (3) When I reboot the computer, I have the same issue.  What troubleshooting steps would I take to identify whether the problem is with the monitor or my Mac?  <comment330895> What Mac, what OS, what connection method [cables/adaptors etc]? We have nothing to go on at the moment. <comment330897> The quickest and easiest troubleshooting step is to connect your HP monitor to a known working video source.  If it works there, then the problem is either your Mac, video adapter, and/or cable. <comment330944> 1. Do what @Allan suggested. Then, if the problem IS your Mac, come back here and do what Tetsujin suggested, otherwise we can't help you.
