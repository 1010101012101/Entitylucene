OSX Finder: Select multiple discrete files/items using keyboard <body> Let's say I have got a bunch of items in a folder on my Finder. And I want to make a non-continuous selection. I can do that using my trackpad and kbdCMD/kbd + emclick/em as in this answer: How do you select multiple specific files?  But I don't want to use my trackpad (I am way faster using my keyboard). On Windows, you would hold down the kbdCtrl/kbd key, navigate using the kbdArrow/kbd keys and select the desired items/files using kbdSpace bar/kbd  This is also unanswered on Apple Discussions: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3298378?start=0  Mind that this question doesn't answer as it has two continuous items albeit on different lines.  <comment373452> I am looking for a script or automation for this same action
