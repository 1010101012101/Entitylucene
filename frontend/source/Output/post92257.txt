Some way to launch/display Notification Center from Quicksilver/Launchbar/Alfred? <body> Pick your favorite launcher (Quicksilver, LaunchBar, etc.)… My current choice is QS, but I'm ok with methods for another launcher. Is there a method to launch/call the notification center from one of these applications?   I know there is a way to set a global hotkey, but stronganother/strong global key is the last thing I need… my current ones are already causing conflicts with one or two apps, and I'll never remember another one. Is there a way to index whatever script or system action is triggered by the two-finger swipe from the edge of the screen?  <answer92259> Well, it wouldn't be pretty, but what I would do is to just assign a really esoteric keyboard command (something guaranteed not to conflict with your existing shortcuts) and then write applescript to invoke that keystroke.  precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke "Some Rarely Used Letter" using {"command down, shift down, control down"}  --Or whatever end tell /code/pre  Then name the script "Open Notifications," add it to the QS catalogue and then you'll start bumping into it when you type "ONoto" or whatever you like to type.   <answer92262> Here is what you want:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "Notification Center"         click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  Then, just save the script, then just add it to quicksilver's triggers.  <comment108244> I'm sure you could write an apple script, and then connect said script to quicksilver <comment108352> Exactly what I was looking for, and it even works when I have [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/) hiding the menu bar icon.
