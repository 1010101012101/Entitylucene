How to perform "Exact Match" in macOS or Finder smart search? <body> Is there any way to perform exact match search in macOS? I want to search file that contains "Endorsement Number", but entering endorsement number as the search criteria shows me the list of file that contains endorsement and number in the result.  I want to find only the files that contain "Endorsement Number".  P.S. It doesnâ€™t have to be case sensitive.  <answer266267> Did you try searching for "Endorsement Number" with surrounding quotes?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQ2bh.png" alt="enter image description here"  I just tested this on my System (macOS Sierra 10.12.2), and a search for "Endorsement Number" (with quotes) returns files that contain "Endorsement Number" excatly, while files that only contain emEndorsement/em or emNumber/em are not shown in the search results.
