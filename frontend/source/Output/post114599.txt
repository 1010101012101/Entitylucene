How do I stop the sync attempts for an app? <body> Whenever I sync my iPhone with iTunes, the phone tells me:     strongiTunes Sync/strong      1 item could not be synced. See iTunes for more information.   And iTunes tells me:     The app "The Elements" was not installed on the iPhone "[...]" because not enough free space was available.   This makes sense, because the app "The Elements" is very large. strongBut I don't want it on my iPhone anyway./strong  How can I stop the attempted sync of this specific app?  <answer114600> ol liGo to iTunes and select the device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0WxJ.png" height="30"/li liSelect the strongApps/strong tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0JVwA.png" height="30"/li liPress the strongWill Install/strong button so that it removes the status and returns to an strongInstall/strong button.  h1img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ldDpC.png" height="30" supsup→/sup/sup img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aU4PE.png" height="30" supsup→/sup/sup img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yZNNT.png" height="30"/h1/li liPress strongSync/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kRxcQ.png" height="30"/li /ol  <comment134279> I tried that before. That is, I pressed the "Remove" button, which then became "Will remove". But the "Sync" and I got the same thing. However, I (only now) noticed that there was a (somewhat darkened?) icon for the app on the phone. I deleted it there and now things are OK. Thanks anyway (+1).
