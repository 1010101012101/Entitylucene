MacBook Pro Lion + lavalier mic records nothing <body> How can I record audio using a lavalier mic and MacBook Pro OSX Lion?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rkv3f.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5kU2S.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have just opened my brand new Audio-Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone. I tried to connect it to the jack just next to the earphones jack and record sound using quicktime player.   Recording works well without a mic, but when I connect the mic and choose codeBuilt in input: line in/code instead of codeBuilt in Microphone: internal microphone/code, only silence is recorded.  The microphone was tested on a Windows 7 notebook, and it works well.  <answer157112> The ATR3350 is not compatible with Macbook Pro. Nor is it compatible with iOS devices. It's a turkey and I regret having bought it. The manufacturer is deliberately misleading people about this unit.  <answer186450> macbook air needs a lavaliere plug that has 4 sections to the plug to override Mac's attempt to only allow mac products. An inexpensive lavaliere type will work with a 4 section inexpensive plug  <answer294139> ATR3350 is compatible with iOS devices.  I have it working on both my iphone6 and iPad Pro (9.5 inch).  At this time however it still does not work on my MacBook pro (13" Retina 2015)  <comment65403> Can you specific which Macbook you have. <comment65439> Updated the question accordingly. <comment65515> To test the mic you can try something like Skype, System Prefs - Sound, etc that will show you a gauge of how much sound is being picked up.
