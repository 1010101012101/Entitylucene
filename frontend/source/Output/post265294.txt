Can I install Yosemite on a different Mac with another Apple ID <body> Can I use a copy of OS X Yosemite installer to install Yosemite on a Mac owned by someone else who obviously has a different Apple ID?  <answer265301> Yosemite should be a free upgrade.  You can also download it for free here.  https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/48498/os-x-yosemite  <comment332647> The download link on MacUpdate points to the App Store where OSX Yosemite is no longer available, at least if you are already on a newer macOS version. <comment332653> If you send your MacBook in to Apple for repair, and they replace the SSD, they will automatically install the latest OS that is compatible with the computer. So from that, you can reasonably infer that Apple could care less about which Apple ID was used to install an OS version. <comment332700> Yes you can depending on the model. <comment332705> I "purchased" Yosemite for free on my macbook so was able to download it from the app store.  I don't want it for my own mac, but for a friend who is on snow leopard and has never upgraded even though she sent it apple for a full service on several occasions. <comment332706> And thank you for the help and link :) <comment332808> The link I posted has it for free, which is why I posted it.
