Wrong icon for Application folder <body> For some reason, my Applications folder is using the Address book icon in the Dock.  How do I change this back to the correct icon.   I am using Mac 10.7.2 (although the problem has been there since 10.6).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TV6xC.png" alt="Wrong icon for Applications folder on Mac"  <answer31942> The icon is not "wrong" : You just have to select "Folder" in the "Display as" menu, not the "Stack". Do this by right-clicking on the folder and select stack.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/soKNd.png" alt="enter image description here""  emPS : Just right click on the icon in your dock to make this menu popup./em
