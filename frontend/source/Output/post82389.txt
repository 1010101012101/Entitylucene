how do I open .packproj files? <body> I can't seem to run an installer with this extension. googling I find no one else with the same problem, which makes me think this is something which should be handled natively, only apparently it isn't. Can anyone shed some light on this? Thank you in advance!  <answer82393> code.packproj/code-files were files used by developers in the process of application development for OS X 10.2. They contain xml-strings â€“ try editing the file in TextEdit or TextWrangler, you should see an XML-structure, or see this example.  It can't really be emrun/em alone, it's used to tell packaging applications how to pack the application into a real application.  To put it short, it can be used with the application Iceberg:     (.packproj): Creates a project file for use with Iceberg. This allows you to use Iceberg to edit package options before creating the actual package.   Do note that this is ancient code, and may not work (supposed to work from OS X 10.2 and up).
