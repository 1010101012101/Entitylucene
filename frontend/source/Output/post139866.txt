How to make certain keystoke in AppleScript? <body> I am trying to make a program that records a live stream for a certain amount of time and then saves it on my desktop. This is what I have so far.  TWiT Live Recorder (30 sec version)  precodetell application "Terminal"      do script "curl http://bglive-a.bitgravity.com/twit/live/high --ignore-content length -o ~/Desktop/TWiT_Live_Archive.flv"      delay 30 end tell tell application "System Events"      keystroke "^C" (^C is the stop signal) end tell /code/pre  But for some reason this does not stop the recording. Why do you think this would be and how can I fix it?  <answer139890> code^C/code is not a valid keystroke. Use:  precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke "c" using control down end tell /code/pre  <answer139891> I've haven't an OSX up my sleeve but I think the problem is : code^C/code is not like kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdC/kbd.   What you are looking for is :   precodekeystroke "c" using control down /code/pre  hr  edit: Was too slow :3   <comment164976> Thanks dude. This worked.
