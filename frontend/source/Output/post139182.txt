How to find the location of an opened file <body> Imagine that I have two files of the same name in two different folders. Now, one of them is opened and I am not sure which one is that. How to find it?  I tried "save as" option and that is not helping me much.  I am using OS X Mavericks.  <answer139183> In most apps you can codeCommand/code-codeClick/code or codeRight/code-codeClick/code on the document's icon in the title bar of the app and it will display a drop down menu with the full path. You can select a folder from the drop down to open it in the Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BcAzj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment164146> What App is it open in? <comment164148> @Mark LibreOffice Writer <comment164149> This also works with "secondary-click" (right-click). <comment164150> I forgot about right clicking. I updated the answer.
