Where are the PNG files for the UI theme stored? <body> I like using my Mac with the "graphite" theme, but I'd like to still keep the color "traffic light" graphics.  I remember from various theme modifiers in the past that these are simple PNG files, so I figured if I copied the color ones into the graphite directory it would use them.  I forget where in the System these files are.  Anyone know?  <answer92653> You might try  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/UI.bundle/Contents/Resources /code/pre  <comment108673> There's no UI.bundle at that path.  I'm on 10.8.3, if it matters. <comment108674> Interesting... I spend most of my time in 10.6; but, in checking a 10.8 machine, it looks like everything is in an ArtFile.bin or ArtFile200.bin (for retina macbooks?) file.
