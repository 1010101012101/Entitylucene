iPad stuck in Guided Access <body> Hello I haven't used Guided Access in a while and I needed to use it again. I had previously set a passcode and I went to use it expecting it would ask for a new passcode, but it must've used the old one. I have no idea what the old one is and I can't get anything off. I had tried holding down Home/Lock for 10 seconds but it just seemed to start up, unlock itself and go back to the app I was on.   Guided Access was still turned on and I have no idea how to remove it.  <answer87223> If you continue to be unable to guess the passcode by brute force attempts, you can connect the device to a computer that has synced the device and unlock things with a sync.  Also, this article shows an alternate method involving a reboot, force quit, and other manipulation of settings in a specified order. Hopefully it helps if you can't use the two "approved" methods above.  http://blog.technguide.net/2012/08/how-to-get-out-of-guided-access-on-ios6/     ol   liHold the Lock Button/li   liSlide the Slide To Power Off slider [If touch is disabled/you're unable to slide it, do a hard reset â€” hold the lock and home button for 8 seconds until the Apple Logo appears]/li   liWhen your iDevices powers up, immediately exit the app that automatic open./li   liGo to Settings  General  Accessibility  Guided Access/li   liClick Set Passcode/li   liEnter new password/li   liReboot again./li   liWait for the app to automatically open and Triple tap the home button/li   liEnter the new password/li   liUnlocked!/li   /ol   <comment101930> I've figured out the passcode but I am leaving this question here and I would like it if someone answered so people will know how to do this. <comment103241> The 1st answer worked!! Thanx soooo much you saved my life :D <comment118138> It took me a few tries to time it correctly between power on and guided access enabled, but I can confirm that the second method also works.
