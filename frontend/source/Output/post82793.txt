iPhone 5 Lightning to USB Cable - Is it safe to use replicas? <body> I need to buy a Lightning to USB cable for my iPhone 5.  In eBay you can find replicas for one third of the price. strongDo you know if these can ruin your phone?/strong If I use an original power adapter, a counterfeit USB cable will have any impact?  <comment95472> Although these clearly are not duplicate, It would be best for the site to have both narrow versions of the same question consolidated.
