Map volume controls to Function Keys on Sierra <body> Since Karabiner is not yet updated for macOS Sierra, is there a way to map volume controls (increase, decrease and mute) to function keys (in my case to F10, F11, F12)?  From System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Display, I can map brightness keys, but is there a workaround for volume too?  To be clear, it's not an Apple keyboard.  <answer278278> Karabiner-Elements is the successor of Karabiner and available for macOS Sierra.
