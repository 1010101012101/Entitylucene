Search inside Notes app in OSX 10.8 <body> As far as I can tell, the search function in Notes only shows you which notes have that string. Is there a way to find the occurrence of the term stronginside/strong the note itself (without copying to a text editor)?   EDIT:  kbd⌘/kbdkbdF/kbd Does not show me any in-note searches. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgBnC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer101753> strongIt appears this solution only works on 10.9 Mavericks…/strong  hr  Select a note, then press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdF/kbd and type your search.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pXvn7.jpg" alt="Notes.app Searching"  This will not work for 'pinned' notes that have been opened outside of the Notes app.  <answer103540> Just in the interest of tidying up loose ends:      It appears this is not possible prior to OSX 10.9 (Mavericks).  <comment119868> That is a bit odd isn't it. Considering all the normal menu items for searching are there but greyed out. <comment119895> I don't see that view of the notes or the search box. (See edited answer.) What version of the Notes app are you showing there? I have 1.5, with OSX 10.8.4. <comment119896> @beroe Oops, seems this was introduced in Mavericks then :( I was sure I'd done this in ML, but obviously not… <comment119898> Good to know they fixed it in 10.9. Did they finally make it so that images in notes are synched to your iOS device too? <comment183058> is it possible to get the updated version of notes without updating my entire OS?
