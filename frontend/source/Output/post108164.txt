How to run a shell script upon user authentication (e.g. screen unlock)? <body> I would like to specify a shell script (say one to send me an email) whenever a emgiven user is authenticated/em, for example if prompted after sleep, fresh login or fast user switching.  PS: I found answers for running a script when the computer wakes from sleep and another for when a user logs into a fresh session, but that is not exactly what I'm looking for.
