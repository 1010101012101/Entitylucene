Finding files with square brackets in filename <body> I have a ton of files - TOSEC ROM sets - on my Mac (El Capitan) that have filenames suffixed with a tag in square brackets - for example  precodeManic Miner (1983)(Bug-Byte Software)[a] Manic Miner (1983)(Software Projects)[a] /code/pre  I'd like to search for these files, with the aim of moving and/or deleting them.  If I try to search for the files using Spotlight:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SVpxU.png" alt="enter image description here"  ... no files are found.  If I try searching for them via Terminal:  precodels *[a]*.* /code/pre  ... I get a list of all the files in the directory.  What's the best way of finding all files with code[a]/code in the filename, and moving and/or deleting them? Is there a way to encapsulate the code[/code and code]/code so a Spotlight search will work?  <answer243164> In Terminal, use code\/code to escape any character:  precodels *\[a\]* /code/pre  <answer243165> If you want to find and delete files that have code[a]/code in the name you can use the following command in a Terminal:  precodefind . -name "*\[a\]*" -print0 | xargs -0 echo rm /code/pre  The above command will find and echo the coderm/code command with the filenames containing code[a]/code. The codeecho/code portion of the command line is added as a safety precaution. Run the command to see that you are okay with its output and then run it again without codeecho/code in the command line to actually delete the files the command outputs.  The shell treats the square brackets differently and as such they need to be escaped with a backslash code\/code and why the output of codels/code was not what you wanted.  <comment299360> I'd have a look at [EasyFind](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/easyfind/id411673888?mt=12) on the app store, freeware. Very comprehensive search options, though no indexing, so it's slower than other methods <comment299458> Thanks - definitely a useful tool, I can see it coming in handy. <comment299460> @KenD, Glad it worked for you. By the way the app mentioned by Tetsujin, EasyFind, is an excellent and handy app to have when you want to do some searching from a GUI versus the command line.
