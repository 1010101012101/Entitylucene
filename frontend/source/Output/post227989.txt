How can I make a color icon a character in the private area of unicode? <body> How can I make my own emoji-like color icon and assign it to the private area of unicode? I recently learned that there's a tool for this purpose for Windows that's called Private Character Editor but what about for Mac? I don't even know what kind of file type the image should be and if this can be done without any special app.   OS X Mountain Lion  <comment277919> See this earlier answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/76637/how-can-i-create-a-custom-colored-icon-font <comment278094> @TomGewecke, thanks for the link, but it doesn't seem to talk about how to assign the newly created glyph to somewhere in the private area of unicode? I'd like to use a lot of existing unicode characters and newly created ones at the same time, so changing the look of existing characters by switching to my own font is not enough. <comment278098> There's really nothing to talk about.  Font editors typically present you with a grid of all possible codepoints and you put your glyphs wherever you want in that grid, including one of the 3 PUA's.  One look at FontForge or one of the others and you will see it right away.
