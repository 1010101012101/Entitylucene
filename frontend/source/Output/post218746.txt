Why is my macbook pro non-retina slow to sleep (15-20 s) despite no sleepimage? <body> So, the situation:  ul linon-retina macbook pro mavericks OS X or newer/li lihave to wait 15+ seconds for macbook to sleep/li lialready tried setting codehibernatemode=0/code (no sleepimage)/li lisee the following text after typing codepmset -g log/code in the terminal:/li /ul  codeTimedOut InternalPreventSleep "com.apple.powermanagement.darkwakelinger" 00:00:15/code  <answer218747> The XLab website says that this 15 sec delay is likely something Apple has added for Mac's that support PowerNap. DarkWake is assumed to be an internal name for PowerNap, and is referenced on a Patent.   For more, please visit the article on Xlab:  http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/mavericks_post_install.html#Delay_before_sleep  <answer218748> I've seen this question come up all over the web with no fix, so will post my solution here.  The issue is that the mac is running a newer OS than it was designed for, and thus doesn't play well with the Power Nap feature available in Mavericks and newer OS X. Non-retina macs lack the hardware to use Power Nap, but power nap isn't emcompletely/em disabled as it should be on a non-retina mac.  The Power Nap feature is still operating to some extent (though logically it should not be on this older hardware). So when your mac tries to sleep, Power Nap hangs because it doesn't know what to do with your old hardware, so the system waits until the whole process times out after 15 seconds.  To disable Power Nap (or darkwake as it's called in the system internals) you'll need to simply toggle it off. But because the file you need to edit is in the System folder, you'll have to disable system-wide security first, make the edit, then re-enable security.  ul li1) Reboot into recovery mode  ul liTurn off the computer./li liHold the Command+R (⌘+R) keys./li liPress and release the power button./li liRelease the Command+R keys once you see the Apple logo./li /ul/li li2) Disable System Security  ul liOpen the Terminal (in Utilities Menu  Terminal)./li liType codecsrutil disable/code./li /ul/li li3) Reboot like normal/li li4) Get a plist file editor if you don't have one (I used codePref Setter/code)/li li5) Open the following plist file using your editor  ul licode/System/Library/CoreServices/powerd.bundle/com.apple.powerd.plist/code/li liYou may need to press Command+UP (⌘+↑) in the file chooser dialog a few times to get up to where /System lives./li /ul/li li6) Make the plist modification  ul liFind the row with codeKeepAlive/code and change its codeTrue/code value to codeFalse/code/li liSave and close/li /ul/li li7) Reboot into Recovery like before/li li8) Enable System Security  ul liOpen the Terminal (in Utilities Menu  Terminal)./li liType codecsrutil enable/code/li /ul/li li9) Reboot like normal/li /ul  Now after activating sleep a few more times, it should be noticeably faster than before. I get 5-8 second sleep times.  <comment264484> I'm aware of that post, and it might be a good read for others.
