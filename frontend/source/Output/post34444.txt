Is there a keyboard short cut to edit a cell in Numbers? <body> Back when I used Excel you could easily do all the navigation and editing on a spreadsheet with the keyboard. I could navigate around with the arrow keys and hit kbdF2/kbd to edit a cell and start typing.  In Numbers '09 I can navigate easily using the arrows then start typing to overwrite the contents of a cell. But I can't figure out how to navigate to a cell and then edit its contents without clicking on the cell with the mouse[1].   strongIs there an easy way to do this without the mouse?/strong  hr  1 -  Okay, so I did figure out one way (kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdC/kbd, kbdspace/kbd, kbdbackspace/kbd, kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdV/kbd) but it's such a hack that the mouse starts looking better.  <answer34445> There are two ways to change the content of a cell using the keyboard:  ol liNavigate to the desired cell with the arrow keys and then simply start typing. The previous content of the cell (if there was any) will be replaced./li liNavigate to the desired cell with the arrow keys and the press kbdALT/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd. The content of the cell will emnot/em be replaced and the cursor appears at the end of the cell content./li /ol  <answer34470> kbd⌥/kbdkbd↩/kbd.  Or just return if you've unchecked emReturn key moves to next cell/em in the inspector:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybhz7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment39483> I went with Lri's answer because you'd repeated what I'd mentioned in the question about overwriting and they'd added the tip about changing the return key's behavior. <comment349966> I can't find this option any more in Numbers 4.0. However, Alt+Enter works anyway.
