Change Keyboard Layout in Turkish F Keyboard Layout <body> I changed the keyboard layout of the Mac to Turkish F keyboard layout. But three keys (x,w,q) are not in their default places. I want to change the layout on my keyboard.   Is this possible?  <answer48074> Yes, using the free application Ukelele, you can change your keyboard layout into exactly what you want.  <comment55101> Have you added a layout that you downloaded somewhere?  Apple provides layouts called Turkish, Turkish qwerty, and Turkish qwerty pc, but not Turkish F. <comment206621> What you mean by 'default places'? Places of all keys on the Apple keyboards on the their default places, but if you used to use PC/Win keyboards then their is a different for some keys. I am also Apple Turkish F keyboard user and typing at this layout about 10 or more year, and well know about ability to change layout by using Ukulele software, but in my opinion it is not right choice because its more right places for keys on Apple keyboard by default.
