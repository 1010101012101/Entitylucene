Why MacBook deleted my files and left me only with DS_Store? <body> Well this is a very awkward situation. I can't understand why my files are missing after reproducing the following steps.  1 - Copy files from Desktop folder and paste into external pen drive.  2 - Paste files into another computer (Windows).  3 - Delete files from pen drive.  Noticed folders are created on Windows, but empty.  However, when going back to OS X, the original Desktop folder holds all sub-folders but with no files too.  There is only a lot of code.DS_Store/code files remaining there.  Is there anyway to recover these files?  Could it possibly be a pen drive virus?  <comment258428> Did you test your method by repeating your actions using different files? My only guess would be that your 'paste' action was actually Cmd/Opt/V rather than Cmd/V, which would move instead of copy. <comment258429> If I moved instead of copying, why there are still the folders remaining? It would have moved all stuff.
