How do I undo this setting on a MacBook? <body> Turns out cats' paws are not a very reliable input method. The cat walked across the keyboard, and now I am stuck in a "secure text field". It looks like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aVSHK.jpg" alt="ono halp"  How do I get out of here?  [question asked on this person's behalf, since I couldn't find them an answer myself]  <answer20736> Found it. kbdcmd/kbd+kbdF5/kbd.   [The by-proxy OP found the answer on their own.]  <answer21773> You've managed to enable VoiceOver! If your sound had been turned on, you'd also hear your computer speaking the words that appear on screen. VoiceOver is OS X's built-in screen reading software for the vision-impaired. It can speak and display lots of information about the elements on screen, including the currently-active text field.  You can disable/enable it with kbd⌘/kbd+kbdF5/kbd (or kbd⌘/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdF5/kbd on newer keyboards). This and more accessibility-related settings and keyboard shortcuts can be found in the Universal Access preferences, and the Universal Access section of the Keyboard preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bjr1s.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6x3Lo.png" alt=""  (In Lion, it seems you get an intro dialog when enabling VoiceOver — perhaps this doesn't happen when the computer is locked, or in previous versions of OS X.) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LLtgS.png" alt=""  <comment22807> I've never seen that before. How do you even activate it? <comment22813> @Kyle Dunno. Ran into somebody on the twitters whose cat made this happen. I've never seen it before, and neither had the Googles... <comment22816> It must be a specific app then <comment22954> Weird...didn't know there was a time limit. <comment23866> For the future curious... this is VoiceOver. <comment23895> @jtbandes do add more info, and I'll transfer the checkmark! <comment230245> I read a bunch of other posts that didn't help. The simple direction to hit Command F5 fixed the problem. Thanks!
