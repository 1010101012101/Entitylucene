iPad 3 stuck in recovery mode <body> I jailbroke this iPad sometime ago and just updated it to 7.1.2, it's now stuck in recovery mode and won't come out even though I tried the button pressing method.   There's a lot of photos on it that wasn't backed up, is there a way to get the iPad out of recovery mode or retrieve the data inside it?  <answer137216> This may pull you out of recovery, but it will clean wipe the iPad. Download the Latest ipsw supported by your iPad. Put the iPad into DFU mode. Open iTunes and press the restore button holding the kbdoption/kbd + Restore if on a mac, or kbdShift/kbd + Restore if on PC and select the downloaded ipsw file.  P.S: Try this for recovery, it is a paid software. I haven't tried this personally, but the software description says that it can recover data from an iDevice stuck in recovery  <answer146805> Here's a better solution I got to keep all my stuff it's the last one on the page https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4310336?start=60&amp;tstart=0  <comment162950> What do you mean by the button pressing mode,is it the DFU mode? <comment162951> I don't think it is in DFU mode cause it has the connect to itunes icon, and what I meant by the button pressing method is the one where you press the home button and lock button together <comment163035> I think my situation is more like this guy's http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90492/jailbroken-iphone-4s-stuck-in-recovery-mode-after-ios-update?rq=1 <comment163038> Yes, ThatÂ´s why I say there is almost no chance of recovering the data, but you can make the iPad usable once again. <comment163041> Couldn't I get out of recovery mode by just clicking restore in itunes? do I need to go through the steps you said in order to get it working? <comment163042> Try to do that, even if does bring you out, it will be a new updated version and there is a chance of issues as your device was previously jailbroken. <comment163044> Ok, thanks for the help, I will use your method to restore if there is no other method to get the data back. <comment172963> Welcome to Ask Different!
