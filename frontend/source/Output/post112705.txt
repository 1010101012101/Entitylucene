Why does iTunes keep re-downloading my deleted podcast episodes? <body> I delete my podcast episodes from iTunes after I listen to them. Recently, I migrated from a Lion machine to a Mavericks machine (both iTunes 11), bringing my iTunes Library with me (but not my preferences file). Since then, when iTunes updates my podcast, it insists on re-downloading the episodes I've deleted (and worse, now they're marked as unplayed).  Is there a setting I need to change to stop this? It used to work fine.  <answer133169> I still don't know why it was doing this, but I've since set iTunes to automatically delete played podcasts after 1 day, and stopped deleting them manually. That does what I need.  <answer270198> Try this: Go to Settings. Tap on the 'Podcast' section. Tap on 'Limit Episodes'. Select how long you want your episodes to be kept.  <comment339506> Which podcast - some get reissued and iTunes don';t see them as being the same. BBV did this with In Our Time <comment339511> This was fixed in iTunes after the OP posted the question and accepted his own answer. <comment358003> @fsb Nothing wrong with an alternative answer, questions aren't just for OP.
