Installed Firefox Beta and now Bing is default search engine in location bar <body> I updated from Firefox 31 to Firefox Beta (32) and when I now do a search in the location bar (the big one to the left) I get results from Bing.  How do I change this back to Google?  <answer143751> about:config  browser.search.defaultenginename  <answer143752> In the search bar (not the the address bar), you can choose which search engine you prefer.  It looks like this on FF31 when you click on the small arrow, a pop up window will open.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y5W1A.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer191545> You can set it to Google in Firefox Preferences. Go to Search tab and select Google as default search engine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cqNQT.png" alt="enter image description here"
