3 TB Fusion Drive missing space after unsuccessful Windows installation via Bootcamp <body> I have been trying to install Windows via Bootcamp on my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017, 3 TB Fusion Drive; Mac OS 10.12.6) and messed up. Here are the steps taken so far:  ul liRan Bootcamp and partitioned successfully/li liRebooted to install Windows 10 and hit an error/li liStopped Windows installation and rebooted in Mac OS/li liTried to restore to single partition using Bootcamp and hit an error/li liTried to restore to single partition in Disk Utility, messed up and Fusion Drive now show as 1.62 TB only/li liRan First Aid in Internet Recovery Mode and had nothing to repair/li liErased and reinstalled Mac OS in Internet Recovery Mode/li /ul  However, half my Fusion Drive is still missing. How do I restore to a single 3TB partition? I have all my data backed up on Time Machine. Appreciate it if someone is able to help please, thanks!  strongdiskutil cs list/strong  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group F3C88EBD-849D-460C-87A0-5951EB3BCA0F     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         1616854839296 B (1.6 TB)     Free Space:   53248 B (53.2 KB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 19F3173E-21AA-498D-BF4D-CF0A00207DCC     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     120883990528 B (120.9 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 051E7004-96A8-4052-B376-88F56AE15CBA     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     1495970848768 B (1.5 TB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 8C0ED5DA-37D5-40D6-AE1E-9291F2738B5B         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         None         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume ED2463F3-F297-4C53-88C7-6701DBF8E63E             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          1611000053760 B (1.6 TB)             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS             LVG Type:              Fusion, Sparse /code/pre  strongdiskutil list/strong  precode/dev/disk0 (internal):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            120.9 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3  /dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            1.5 TB     disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             1.5 TB     disk1s3  /dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +1.6 TB     disk2                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2                                  ED2463F3-F297-4C53-88C7-6701DBF8E63E                                  Unencrypted Fusion Drive /code/pre  strongdiskutil info disk1s3/strong  precode Device Identifier:        disk1s3    Device Node:              /dev/disk1s3    Whole:                    No    Part of Whole:            disk1     Volume Name:              Recovery HD    Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Volumes/Recovery HD     Partition Type:           Apple_Boot    File System Personality:  HFS+    Type (Bundle):            hfs    Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended    Owners:                   Enabled     OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 SATA    SMART Status:             Verified    Volume UUID:              6BD5580D-FF8B-3C7A-A9D4-4328AE128DF3    Disk / Partition UUID:    D70E2D06-129A-492F-8F2F-41952CB59CB3     Disk Size:                1.5 TB (1504278159360 Bytes) (exactly 2938043280 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Volume Total Space:       1.5 TB (1504278159360 Bytes) (exactly 2938043280 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Used Space:        733.2 MB (733249536 Bytes) (exactly 1432128 512-Byte-Units) (0.0%)    Volume Available Space:   1.5 TB (1503544909824 Bytes) (exactly 2936611152 512-Byte-Units) (100.0%)    Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Yes     Device Location:          Internal    Removable Media:          Fixed     Solid State:              No /code/pre  <answer292722> Your 3.1 TB Fusion Drive isn't really missing space. Stopping the Windows install and trying to revert to a previous state inflated the size of the Recovery HD at the expense of your main macOS volume "Macintosh HD". The normal size of the Recovery HD partition is 650.0 MB with ~526 MB occupied by a base macOS system and ~124 MB of free space.  hr  Now you can either remove the oversized recovery partition (alluding to this answer: How do I regain unaccessible free space after a failed Boot Camp install on a non-Fusion drive?), expand the Logical Volume disk2 and reinstall macOS to recreate the recovery partition strongor/strong you can resize your current recovery partition to a smaller but non-standard size and expand the Logical Volume disk2.    The first option takes at least 90 minutes, the second probably less than two minutes.   The second option works like this:  ul liBoot to your main macOS volume/li liGet the partition list with codediskutil list/code and here the device identifier of the recovery partition/li liResize the oversized 1.5 TB recovery partition:  precodediskutil resizeVolume diskXs3 1024m #with X either 0 or 1 /code/pre  If you get a "too small" error choose a slightly larger size like 1088m until you are successful./li liGet the UUID of the Logical Volume with codediskutil cs list/code/li liResize the CoreStorage stack with:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID size /code/pre  In your case that's:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack ED2463F3-F297-4C53-88C7-6701DBF8E63E 3105817m /code/pre  If you get a "too large" error choose a slightly smaller size like 3105812m until you are successful. The larger your Recovery HD has to be in the first resize step, the smaller the size has to be here./li /ul  <comment369301> @klanomath sorry, didn't think about that! I've edited my post and added the disk0s3 info. <comment369304> Yikes ok, have edited the post again. Should be correct now! <comment369306> AdminInfo.plist and 3 folders (com.apple.boot.P, com.apple.recovery.boot, System) <comment369311> While resizing CoreStorage, I'm getting this error: `Error: -69711: This operation couldn't proceed because the target's boot helper was mounted; you may want to try again` <comment369312> Did you boot to Recovery Mode or is your recovery partition mounted? If the latter unmount it. <comment369313> The recovery partition was mounted. The resizing works now. Thank you so much for your help!
