Do I have to reinstall XQuartz every time I upgrade MacOS? <body> I use a slightly weird setup where I will connect from my Mac laptop to a linux machine, using codessh -X/code, and from there connect to a Windows machine using coderdesktop/code. This works just fine, but whenever I update Mac OS (even minor upgrades), I find I have to re-install XQuartz. If I don't, coderdesktop/code fails with the message codeERROR: Failed to open display:/code. After I re-install XQuartz, it works as expected (no reboot or log out or anything, just opening a new connection with codessh -X/code).  Is there a way I can avoid having to reinstall XQuartz all the time? It gets a little annoying.  <comment360707> It happens to me as well. Evertytime I update macOS Sierra I have to reinstall XQuartz. Have you reinstalled yours yet? In case no, it might be worthwhile reporting a bug at their website. I plan to do that next time I updated my macOS.
