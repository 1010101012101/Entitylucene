Deep sleep keyboard shortcut <body> I have been a windows user for a long time now and I have been used to pressing just one key in my keyboard to hibernate the machine every night. I recently bought a mac mini and I press kbdShift/kbd + kbdCommand/kbd + kbdEject/kbd to put it to sleep and then it would go to deep sleep in a while. But I am wondering if there is a keyboard shortcut to do this or maybe change the default sleep to a deep sleep.  Mac mini late 2012 with standard HDD, i5, 4gb ram  <answer142258> The two keyboard shortcuts for sleep: Display sleep: kbdShift/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdEject/kbd Computer sleep: kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdEject/kbd  Source: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343  To change the default sleep mode to hibernate (in the terminal):  precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 /code/pre  I don't think there's any way to preserve the normal sleep behaviour and have a separate keyboard shortcut for hibernation without writing a script that changes to hibernate mode when called and changes it back after, somehow, but this command does work on my MBP. There's a number of options for sleep that you can see with:  precodeman pmset /code/pre  <comment167636> Yes my bad, I meant to say Option + Command + Eject. But its not the deep sleep. <comment167649> Sorry, I didn't understand what you meant by deep sleep. I've amended my answer with how to change the default sleep mode. <comment168234> Thats exactly what I needed. Usually when you put the mac to sleep the light blinks. After like 4 hours it goes into Deep sleep (hibernate) where the light doesnt blink
