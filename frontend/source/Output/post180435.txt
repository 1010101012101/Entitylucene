Macbook pro 2009 update not taking effect <body> I downloaded the update for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3. I restarted when it told me, but the update did not take effect. When I manually rebooted, that didn't work either. How do I solve this?  <answer180436> In the Updates section of the App Store, if the 10.10.3 update is fully downloaded, the "Update" button next to it should be replaced by a "Restart" button. Click it, then click "Restart" on the notification that'll come up in the upper right of the screen, and then a restart will happen and the update will be installed.  <answer180467> If for some reason an update appears to be stuck, even after following user24601's advice, then the next thing to try would be to download &amp; run the standalone OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 Combo Update which contains all updates since 10.10.0 &amp; usually will bring things back into line.
