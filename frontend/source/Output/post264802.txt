Restore data from encrypted iOS backup without respective device <body> My iPhone stopped working but I have encrypted backups on my machine. I won't get a new iPhone but I obviously want to extract all my data. Is there any tool how I can extract the data without buying a new iPhone?  I know about many 3rd party tools, but they all have a cost behind it, and I'm wondering if you know a way to do this.  <answer264809> You can decrypt an iTunes Encrypted Backup (when the password is known) using backup_tool.py from iphone-dataprotection on Google Code.  Navigate to an suitable destination in Terminal, then run the following:  precodehg clone https://code.google.com/p/iphone-dataprotection/ python iphone-dataprotection/python_scripts/backup_tool.py ~/Library/Application\ Support/MobileSync/Backup/backupname decrypted /code/pre  supReplace codebackupname/code with the encrypted backup folder name./sup  The tool will prompt you for the encryption password, then output the decrypted backup to the folder ‘decrypted’.  <comment331978> I do have the password, but is there any more information about this tool? I would like to not run my data through a CLI tool I know nothing more of but the name. <comment331979> @supersize You can read the python code of the tool before you run it, I have experience with the tool I've used it a few times but it's been a long time and I don't have a source of any more information, there might be more available on the Google Code but that's basically shut down now
