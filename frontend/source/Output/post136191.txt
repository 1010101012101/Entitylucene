Prevent Spotlight from indexing future hard drives <body> Using Mavericks, how can I prevent Spotlight from indexing all drives except my primary internal drive?  In my work, I connect dozens of new drives every week, and I do not want the .Spotlight-V100 folder to be created on them.  I know I can add each drive to the Spotlight privacy list, but that can only be done after connecting the drive, and then the .Spotlight-V100 folder has already been created.  I could disable Spotlight completely, but then I lose the convenience of indexing my internal drive.  I want to use Spotlight for my internal drive only, and disable it for all other drives, including ones that have yet to be connected.  <answer136213> A file called  precode.metadata_never_index /code/pre  place in the root of any volume will suppress indexing behaviour.  You can generate this file automatically  the following files need to be created as root  the following shell script will create the requisite file should an active (less than 30 days old) spotlight entry not be found.  precode/var/root/unindex.sh /code/pre  to create this  precodesudo vi /var/root/unindex.sh /code/pre  or use your preferred text editor  The contents should be  precode#!/bin/bash # suppress spotlight indexing of new volumes # pc 26-june-2014 v0.1 # v 0.2 27-june-2014 add mdutil  # get the last volume mounted  vol=$(df) vol=${vol##*%} echo $vol     # is this a volume that has been indexed in the past month  count=$(find ${vol}/.Spotlight-V100 -mtime -30 | wc -l ) [[ $count -gt 1 ]] &amp;&amp; {  # then it remains so  logger -t unindex spotlight activity detected in last 30 days exit 0 }  # else create index supression file logger -t unindex creating ${vol}/.metadata_never_index touch ${vol}/.metadata_never_index # and stop spotlight indexing the drive logger -t unindex mdutil -i off /Volumes/${vol} mdutil -i off /Volumes/${vol} /code/pre  make sure it can be executed...  precodesudo chmod a+x /var/root/unindex.sh /code/pre  now add an entry to launchd, create the file   precode/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.misctools.unindex.plist /code/pre  to create this  precodesudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.misctools.unindex.plist /code/pre  with contents  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;org.misctools.unindex&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/var/root/unindex.sh&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartOnMount&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  now activate the job  precodesudo launchctl load org.misctools.unindex.plist /code/pre  the job will launch every time you mount a disk, look in the console for messages filtered by 'unindex' for it's actions e.g. from my machine  precode 26/06/2014 09:02:35.824 unindex[1362]: creating /Volumes/hfs/.metadata_never_index /code/pre  <answer136216> Use the command line tool strongmdutil/strong.  For example, say you connect an HFS+ journaled volume named "LEAVE_ME_BE"  Use the following command to disable indexing of the volume. If ownership is enabled, running as codesudo/code may be necessary:  precodesudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/LEAVE_ME_BE /code/pre  Check indexing status of all connected volumes:  precodemdutil -s /Volumes/* /code/pre  Read the man page linked above for further options.  <comment161511> something like disable the USB port ? <comment161603> Very thorough answer, thank you.  I'll give this a try tomorrow.  I wasn't aware of the StartOnMount feature.  Are you sure this script will run fast enough, before Spotlight starts indexing? <comment161635> It worked on one drive, but not on another.  The syslog shows Spotlight working just before unindex starts. `Jun 26 19:33:00 macpro mds[12724]: (Normal) Volume: volume:0x7fa145816800 ********** Bootstrapped Creating a default store:3 SpotLoc:/Volumes/B025_0626AI/.Spotlight-V100 SpotVerLoc:/Volumes/B025_0626AI/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1 occlude:0 /Volumes/B025_0626AI Jun 26 19:33:00 macpro unindex[13367]: creating /Volumes/B025_0626AI/.metadata_never_index` <comment161688> Looks like it may be failing on drives with no spotlight folder <comment161717> It seems to be random.  I've tried about a dozen drives today, none of which contain a Spotlight folder.  For half of them, your script runs first, while the other half run Spotlight first. <comment161719> Ok, I've used njboots suggestion of mdutil to explicitly stop spotlight indexing the volume. Spotlight and the Mount event are run asynchronously, so it's random which one gets in first  . The edit is in the unindex.sh file.
