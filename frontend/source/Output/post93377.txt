Natively binding mac's remote home button <body> Is there an apple script, automator task, shell, secret or even very small app which I can simply bind just 1 button on the remote?  I'm well aware of Better Touch Tool, but it gets remote exclusivity and I want remote to work with any app. And it's a little strongbloated/strong too. I also know about Remote Buddy (love their other tool), but that's just strongtoo much/strong (a.k.a. probably embloated/em and eventually buggy too) and too expensive for this simple job I need.
