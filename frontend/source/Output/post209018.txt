XtraFinder makes Finder windows not all restore <body> I love XtraFinder, but it seems to prevent all windows from restoring when Finder restarts (e.g., after typing codekillall Finder/code in the terminal).  I'm on Yosemite (10.10.5), and Finder restores all windows and tabs when I reboot or relaunch it emwithout/em XtraFinder. However, when it boots emwith/em XtraFinder, no windows open at all (although Finder has started), and when I click on the Finder icon, it opens one window from the previous session (always the same), but not the other ones.  This happens whether or not the codesave open tabs when quitting Finder/code option in XtraFinder is enabled.  How to have the original session restore behavior with XtraFinder enabled?  <answer248600> Seems, from the duration it is left unanswered, this is yet to be worked on. For the time being, as a work around, save the window with all its tabs. And reopen the same window after restart.    <answer248714> The problem is gone. I realized the OS X setting for restoring windows was disabled. I enabled it, and Finder windows are now restored properly (even though the XtraFinder option codesave open tabs when quitting Finder/code is disabled).  <comment252100> Which folder does it open? (When you click on it) <comment252123> It's a window with with a few tabs to personal folders. They always get saved and restored properly.
