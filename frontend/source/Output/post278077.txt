Safari default keychain to store the autofill info <body> I'm testing the autofill feature of Safari. When I add the login and password for a site, Safari stores the information in the "Local Items" Keychain. My question is if I can change this default keychain to another one, for example mykeychain. I want to use a password protected keychain only to autofill data.   Is this change possible on macOS?  <comment349957> Ok, I'm going to edit it :)
