Computer slows when battery is low <body> My Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion slows down dramatically when the battery is below 4-5%. All the applications running are very slow to respond, and several have the "Application not responding" message when I right-click on them in the dock. Now everything works fine when the battery is above 5%, so I'm wondering what goes on when the battery is low that causes the performance drag. Basically, I have two questions:  ol liWhat is causing this lag (for the sake of curiosity)?/li liHow can I fix it (for the sake of practicality)?/li /ol  strongSystem Info:/strong  ul listrongDevice:/strong Macbook Pro (Spring 2012) 13-Inch running Mountain Lion (10.8)/li listrongMemory:/strong 8GB/li listrongProcessor:/strong 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7/li listrongStorage:/strong 500GB SSD Drive with more than half free/li /ul  <answer61295> See if this link provides you with some useful knowledge. http://smallbusiness.chron.com/change-processor-speed-macbook-pro-43635.html  It's likely that the MBP is automatically scaling the processing power back to conserve battery power, but that isn't necessarily the only cause.  <answer194019> This is normal, the same thing happens on my MacBook Air (11 inch, 2014) when the battery gets around 5%, performance drops significantly, it does this because your battery level is so low, just plug it in a charger and it will start working normally again. If this doesn't solve it, try resetting the SMC.  <comment70742> It sounds like CPU speed stepping to me. <comment105873> has the provided answer solved your problem? Because I don't see any of the described settings in 10.8 <comment105890> @barbaz - It didn't really solve the problem, but it seems like there is no solution so I accepted it. <comment185011> Same problem with MacBook Air 2013. <comment236754> I'd really like to find a solution to this, it's annoying for me as I can't do any work with the last 10% of battery life, so it's effectively dead anyway. <comment302374> Soooo is there a command I can run or a kernel change I can make to prevent this??
