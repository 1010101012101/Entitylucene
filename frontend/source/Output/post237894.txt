Mail: How to show all recipients by default? <body> The top of my Mail messages say codeTo:/code followed by the primary recipient, plus a link labelled codeand 3 more…/code. Clicking that link reveals the additional recipients.   I'd rather not have to click the link, I'd like to see all recipients always.   The limit appears to be based on length, not kind. Such as, if codeTo:/code recipient's name and email address are short enough, the codeCc:/code recipient is then shown.   I've tried clicking codeApp Prefs / Viewing / Show message headers: Custom…/code, then clicking code+/code, then typing codeTo:/code and codeCc:/code and codeBcc:/code, but this doesn't override the apparent length limit.   Is there something I've missed? I've also reported to http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html. Thank you.

And hiding the left-pane list of mailboxes does not help.
