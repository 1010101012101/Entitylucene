Different "Preferred Networks" for different Network "Location" <body> The question is: can I have different "Preferred Networks" when switching from one to another Network "Location"?  This issue has been discussed before at Ask Different: Can't I use different WiFi networks for different Locations?. However, I do not like a solution that ought to use some external App.  I would appreciate any comment! Thanks!  <answer177988> Each of your Locations will show WiFi.  To differentiate by location you have to rename them.  To do that click on the Gear box icon at the bottom of the location screen and choose rename service.  Now you can get creative in naming the service to your liking in each of the Locations. The WiFi function will remain.  <comment210632> It supposed to do just that. So what is not working ? <comment210727> All WiFis are appearing in all Locations :-( <comment210734> You have to name them something other then just WiFi :) Like WiFi Home, WiFi Friend,,,,,Click on the Gear box and rename service according to the location!
