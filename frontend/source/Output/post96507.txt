What chargers are compatible with A1226? <body> I need to buy a power supply for my A1226 15-inch Macbook Pro (2007), but I can't find any anywhere. Apple's online store, ebay, or amazon. So I'm wondering if the charger doesn't have to be the one for your specific model. I found this charger that says that it's for Macbooks and 13-in Macbook Pros. It's 60W, so I'm guessing that it'll work. Will it?  <answer96508> For your mac you'll need a 85W power adapter like that one.  <comment113288> Maybe that's why I've melted three 60W chargers. <comment113290> That's very likely.
