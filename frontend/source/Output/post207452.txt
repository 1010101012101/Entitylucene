No passcode if at home? <body> Is there a way to set up the iPhone so that when I'm away from home it requires a lock code, but when I'm at home I don't need a passcode?  <answer207493> Actually, the basic functionality does not provide this feature.  You can do this by Jaibreaking your device (getting write priviligies to system partition) and installing tweaks like :  ul liAutoProtect/li liCleverPin/li /ul  <comment250390> Good idea.
