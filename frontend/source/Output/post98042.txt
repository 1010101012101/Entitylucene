Plugged faulty USB into Mac Air, won't turn on <body> I have an external DVD drive with an AC power input. I plugged it into a power source and then into my Mac Air (the generation released a year ago). The computer shut down immediately. When I attempted to turn it back on, it made typical startup sounds the first few times but won't anymore. I've tried resetting the SMC multiple times. The charger indicator light suggests that the SMC reset worked, but my laptop still won't start up. After all this, I realized that the external DVD drive's power cord was from another appliance. It's hard to decipher the voltage information on the back, but it says:  precodePRI.: 100-240V ~ 50/60Hz 0.8A SEC.: 13V= 0-2.3A (SET AT 2.0A) /code/pre  Any suggestions? I'm really concerned that I've fried my laptop.  <comment115052> Did you try start up in safe mode? Was that a USB charger cord ? <comment115054> It won't show any signs of life, so that isn't possible. <comment115055> OK, try taking the battery out and disconnect from power than connect again. <comment115056> There isn't any easy way to remove the battery. I would need to remove the back plate and I don't have the necessary screwdriver. <comment115057> Well, it has no signs of life so you need to do some surgery. Is it charging the battery ? <comment115058> It sounds like there was a spike in power to the logic board.  The USB ports are designed to shutdown in the event of an overcharge but that failsafe may have failed.  Your best bet may be to take it into Apple.  If it's under warranty I wouldn't mention the DVD drive situation, just that it's refusing to power on.  Even if it's out of warranty they'll test it out (I can only imagine pulling the battery, not much else to disconnect) and give you a free quote.  Good luck!
