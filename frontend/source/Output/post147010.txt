If so, you can do the following to restore the backups:  ul liGo to Settings - General - Reset - "Erase All Content and Settings"/li liIt will ask if your sure, you are. /li liWhen the phone resets, it will ask if you would like to set this up as a new phone or restore from backup... tell it you want to restore./li liit will ask if it's an iCloud or iTunes based backup, give the correct answer./li liWait until the restore is complete./li /ul  Note that if you're doing this from iCloud, you'll need to be WiFi connected for quite some time for the restore to complete.  If you have NOT been syncing/backing up your iPhone, you may be out of luck :-(  Alternatively, if this is really a question about how to recover your AppleID &amp; Password, you'll need to follow these steps on Apple's website.
