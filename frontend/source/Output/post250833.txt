Manually recover Calendar files from backup not working <body> I recently 'resetted' my iMac and I want to emrecover my calendars/em.   I know the concerned files are stored in  code/Volumes/MyExternalHardDrive/... .../Users/Library/Calendars/code.  I copied these files to code~/Library/Calendars/code.  However, when opening the Calendar app, nothing seems to change (my former events don't appear).   (This may seem a bit simplistic, but this method worked perfectly for the "AddressBook" files, and I was foolishly hoping to be as lucky with the calendars...)
