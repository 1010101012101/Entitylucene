How do you access a subdomain on localhost with VMWare Fusion on a Mac? <body> I am able to access localhost on a Mac through Windows XP on VMWare Fusion by using my Mac username like this:  precodehttp://username.local:3000/ /code/pre  But how do I do that with a subdomain, something like this:  precodehttp://username.subdomain.local:3000/ /code/pre  Any ideas?  I am able to access subdomains on my Mac no problem, by adding things like codeblog.localhost/code to code/etc/hosts/code.  What is the equivalent on Windows?  <answer17290> Navigate to codeC:\windows\system32\drivers\etc/code where the 'hosts' file is located.
