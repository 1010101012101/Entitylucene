MacBook Pro fan running with no CPU load and computer is COLD <body> Under normal circumstances (not installed new programs recently; had the usual programs running) I found my MacBook Pro 13" (Early 2015) with the fans running at average speed.  I always have the Activity Monitor CPU load indicator in Dock, to keep an eye at CPU usage, but this time it was not some program that got stuck using 100% CPU.  I downloaded iStat Menus to check temperatures, and I confirmed everything is strongcold/strong:  precodeAir Flow Proximity: 38°C Battery TS1: 33°C Battery TS2: 32°C Battery TS_MAX: 33°C CPU Core 1: 43°C CPU Core 2: 42°C CPU Gfx Core: 42°C CPU Proximity: 41°C CPU System Agent Core: 44°C DDR3 Proximity: 39°C PCH PECI Die: 45°C Palm Rest: 32°C Palm Rest 2: 31°C Right Fin Stack: 36°C SSD: 36°C Hard Drive: 35°C  Fan: 6198rpm  CPU Vcore: 1.87V DC In: 16.45V PBus: 12.93V /code/pre  These values are steady since half an hour, and the fan keeps running at this speed.  Do temperature values look normal? The computer chassis is strongcold/strong, and the air blowing from behind function keys also is cold.  What could be the cause and what can I do?  <comment231027> Have you tried performing an SMC reset? <comment231028> Nope. I just found [this page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295) and I'm going to try it right now. <comment287210> @mescalinum Did the SMC-reset work? <comment287388> @flindeberg nope. now I no longer own that macbook
