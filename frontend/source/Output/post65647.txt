How can I install Messages.app on Lion <body> Is there any way to get the final version of Messages.app installed on Lion?  For reasons I'll not get into at this point upgrading to Mountain Lion is not possible.  I had the beta of Messages.app but removed it because it was buggy.  Is there any way to install the 1.0 version on Lion?  <answer65655> Update: strongThe final build of Messages isn't available for Lion. It is only available on Mountain Lion./strong  MacRumors had an article on this:     Apple has not removed the download entirely, however, as it is still   accessible via direct download (63.8 MB)   You can also download it via Mac Update.  <comment77369> Thats still the beta.  I want the Final version <comment77379> @dstarh oh. The final build of Messages isn't available for Lion.
