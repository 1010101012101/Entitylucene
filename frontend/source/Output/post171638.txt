Never have Chrome track my location when using Google.com <body> I spend a great deal of time outside the USA, but I only want to use Google.com.  Not Google.com.zz.  (Were zz is a two letter country code). In Chrome, when I type Google.com, I always want the search to be with Google.com.  When using the omnibox, I want the search to be only Google.com.    And when I go to the bottom of the Google search page, I never want to see...  (the name of the city I am in) - From your Internet address  I only location I want to see is...  unknown  I had this working for the longest time, but something seems to have gotten reset and I can't figure out what it is, even after googling and an hour or three of wasted time.  <comment201953> This doesn't answer your question, but might be worth checking out: I use http://duckduckgo.com as an alternative to google for search. They don't track you. (I have no stake in duckduckgo except as a user)
