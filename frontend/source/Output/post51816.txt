QuickLook HTML plugin? <body> I'm looking for a plugin that will display me the text of HTML files in QuickLook rather than a preview of the rendered HTML.  Does anyone know of such a plugin?  <answer51978> You are looking for qlcolorcode. qlcolorcode allows you to have syntax highlighting in your quicklook preview:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Kzbs.png" alt=""  <answer60875> qlcolorcode didn't display HTML files by default on my installation of 10.8. I could get it to display them by adding codepublic.html/code and codepublic.xhtml/code to codeCFBundleDocumentTypes:LSItemContentTypes/code in code~/Library/QuickLook/QLColorCode.qlgenerator/Contents/Info.plist/code and logging out and back in.  You could also remove code/System/Library/QuickLook/Web.qlgenerator//code, but it also handles codewebarchive/code and codesvg/code files. Removing the entries for codepublic.html/code and codepublic.xhtml/code from the codeInfo.plist/code didn't seem to work.  <answer158843> I had to get rid of the Web.qlgenerator to make this work, using either the QLColorCode or the QLStephen plugins, in OSX Mavericks.
