Stop iOS 7 update installation <body> I made a mistake and accidentally started downloading iOS 7 on my device.  I didn't notice it until it finished downloading but now it says it needs minimum of 50% charge to start installation.  I strongdo not want to install/strong and and I am concerned of charging my phone as the download might start automatically   Will it install automatically?  <answer140746> It should not install until and unless you click on install.  <comment165882> This is true. The update will always require input from the user. When the download finishes, simply hit cancel when the prompt appears.
