What is the iPad's screen refresh rate? <body> Is it 60 Hz like the phones/touches?  <answer8013> 60Hz.  Apple DTS has not changed any of their answers about 60Hz refresh rates with respect to any device model, and no one has reported any higher rate.  <comment8642> I've seen the number 60Hz floating around the net for the iPad, but can't find any super trustworthy sources the explicitly state this number. I'd say it's a safe bet though. <comment338886> 60 Hz is good enough for geometry dash lol
