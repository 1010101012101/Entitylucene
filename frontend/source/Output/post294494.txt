Debugging Apple Watch Wifi <body> Apple Watch should connect automatically to any network I was previously connected with on my iPhone.  At my university I need to register devices for network access by providing them with a MAC address. There are strongno/strong further logins required and the network is open.  I connected to this network with my iPhone and it works. Then I registered another device using the MAC address from settings - General - About - MAC Address.  However, the Apple Watch just doesn't connect.  How can this be debugged?  <answer294505> Unfortunately watchOS 3.x can't connect to a Wi-Fi secured by WPA2-Enterprise.  I have experienced the same behavior in the past with watchOS 2.x as well.  This assumes:  ul liYour university's Wi-Fi is part of eduroam or uses a smiliar Wi-Fi login using your credentials (user name + password)/li liYour university's Wi-Fi thus uses the WPA2-Enterprise security protocol/li liYou can connect to the Wi-Fi just fine with iOS devices like your iPhone/li liYou use an Apple Watch running watchOS 3.x/li /ul  With iOS you can enter your credentials. They will get saved and can be transferred to watchOS. The certificate, however, cannot be provided from iOS to watchOS.  h1Let Apple Know/h1  Contact Apple and let them know. Apple cares about user's feedback. Use Apple's feedback form for Apple Watch.  hr  strongUpdated answer/strong  emdivB has pointed out that the network uses a MAC address filter instead of the WPA2-Enterprise security protocol/em  Please make sure to provide your Apple Watch's MAC address to your university as well as your iPhone's MAC address.  You can find it on your iPhone:  codeWatch.app &gt; General &gt; About &gt; Wi-Fi Address/code  <comment371728> Can you please add your specs? (which Apple Watch, which version of watchOS/iOS) <comment371768> Thank you for the updated question. Have you provided your Apple Watch's MAC address to your university as well?
