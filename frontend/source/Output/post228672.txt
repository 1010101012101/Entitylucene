Creating a bootable Windows USB drive when Bootcamp is already installed <body> I just upgraded to El Capitan, and am now having issues booting directly into Windows. I need a bootable Windows USB stick to repair my bootcamp partition, but I'm having a difficult time making that happen.  I thought I would simply be able to use Bootcamp Assistant to create the bootable USB drive (as I did when I first install windows through Bootcamp on Yosemite), but I no longer have that option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8j4xa.png" alt="Bootcamp Assistant"  As the above image shows, the only option I have is to remove my bootcamp partition, which is not what I want.  I've tried to manually write the ISO to the USB stick by using the terminal according to this question (multiple times), but it never shows on the boot menu. I've also tried using Rufus, and that shows as a bootable drive, but then I just get a black screen after I select it as the boot device.  How do I create a bootable Windows USB Drive when Bootcamp does not provide me that option? This is on a 2015 MacBook Pro, originally shipped with Yosemite and just updated to El Capitan.  UPDATE:  I was able to create a bootable USB stick by using Rufus with the following settings:  ul liPartition Scheme: GPT partition scheme for UEFI/li liFile System: Fat32/li liCluster Size: 4096 bytes/li liCreate Bootable Disk using ISO Image  ul liStandard Windows Installation/li /ul/li /ul  Since Rufus is a Windows program, I'll keep this open in case someone can answer how to do this in OS X.
