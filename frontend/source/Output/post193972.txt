Make a window jump between displays? <body> Any good apps (app store official would be preferred) that make a window jump between displays?  When I used a Windows PC at work there was a program installed, I can't recall what, that when i selected a button on the applications window it automatically made the window jump to the 2nd display at the same location.  There was also a full screen button too but Apple has that feature built in ha.    Anyone know of a way to duplicate this action?  Especially since there are times windows seem to open up in random locations and I hate having to drag them across displays.  <comment231323> i believe that what Mission Control was created for. You simply click the key that has three windows on it, then drag it into another desktop... <comment231338> I'm not sure how thats any different than what I described.  I'm still having to drag a window between multiple displays whether its in Mission Control mode or not. <comment231363> You can assign the apps to each desktop by right clicking the icon in the dock. <comment231494> The only Options I have when I right-click are Remove from Dock, Open at Login, and Show in Finder.  Also I am using a Macbook Pro so not sure that option is viable either since there are times I am on the go and don't have my second display attached.
