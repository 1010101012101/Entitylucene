How to close all windows of Mac OS X Finder? <body> Having 30 or 40 windows of different folders open, is there any way to close all of them at once? I tried to relunch Finder, and I was happy for a second having no open window anymore, but it reopened all the folder windows again :-)  <answer74505> Yes, you can use the shortcut kbd⌥ option/kbd + kbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdW/kbd.  <answer74522> A sidenote on this: Often such commands are not visible in the main menu if you just click it. However, if you press ⌥ emwhile the menu is open/em, then the menu will change to view the alternate feature.  Another example:   strongFile/strong  strongGet Info ⌘I/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIPQl.jpg" alt="File menu without modifier keys pressed"   will turn into strongFile/strong  strongShow Inspector ⌥⌘I/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBrFj.jpg" alt="File menu with ⌥ key pressed"  once you press ⌥. As you can see in this image, strongClose Window ⌘W/strong turns into strongClose All Windows ⌥⌘W/strong as well.  <comment86533> Brilliant way, thank you <comment86543> Holding down *Option* while clicking the close button also works <comment86551> Great comment! Thanks <comment160158> as an apple fanboy, you might automatically know the meaning of the hieroglyphics that describe the shortcut, but it might be helpful to mention the words option and command, for those who have not carved those symbols into their macbook. the command symbol was there, but the option one is not. "knowing" a symbol means something is all well and good, but the average user just looks at the keyboard and goes "duh? dont' see that key"
