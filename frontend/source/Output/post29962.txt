How to restore the AddressBook database from backup <body> How do I transfer my address book files in the abcdp format to my new MacBook Pro with Mac OS X Lion?    The files are from a 2008 MacBook running Mac OS X 10.6; the hard drive crashed, and the computer won't start up at all. Luckily, I had everything backed up with Mozy. I restored the files on the new MacBook, but I cannot read the abcdp format. I've tried a few other solutions such as copying the abcdp files into the metadata folder with no luck.  <answer30045> Assuming that you mean an codeabcddb/code (not codeabcddp/code) file, what you have is the SQL Lite database file AddressBook is storing all contacts in. Quitting AddressBook, copying that file to  precode~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/AddressBook-v22.abcddb /code/pre  (where code~/code is your home directory – note the codeLibrary/codefolder is hidden by default in Lion; click “Go To” while holding kbdAlt/kbd in Finder or do a codeopen $HOME/Library/code in Terminal to reveal it) and restarting AddressBook should be your ticket to a successful restore.   <answer40517> First, the database file is ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/*.abcddb (with abcddb meaning Address Book CoreData database). The files in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Metadata have extensions like .abcdp (Address Book CoreData person) and .abcdg (Address Book CoreData group). The metadata files can serve as a backup if the .abcddb goes bad or missing. So if you want to restore those abcdp files, you need to:  ol liBack up your Address Book data/li liQuit all applications/li liMove, rename, or delete the .abcddb file mentioned above/li liPut the abcdp files into the Metadata subdirectory listed above/li liLaunch Address Book.app/li liSelect and drag the contacts out to save them in one or more vCard files/li liRestore your Address Book backup created in step 1/li liImport the vCard(s) created in step 6/li /ol  If you need any help or clarification on this technique, please leave a comment. I hope this works for you!  <answer126258> If you have not only code.abcdp/code files but the whole codeLibrary/Application Support/AddressBook/code backed up, just copy directory somewhere, add code.abbu/code extension and open it (code.abbu/code should be associated with codeContacts.app/code). One downside is that it does not propose to merge contacts but to replace them.  <comment45827> abcdp files are Address Book CoreData person files from the Metadata subdirectory. Since the originator wrote "files in the abcdp format", this is what I assume they are talking about. <comment46328> @bneely: good call – wasn’t aware of those. <comment86252> after reinstall (reformat, too) with slow leopard, i had tried importing the whole folder from TM bkp, but, that did NOT work.  so i just copied the abdddb file and VOILA!  thanx!
