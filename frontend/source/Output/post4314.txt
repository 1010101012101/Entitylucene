How tell Safari to open new tab instead of a window <body> How do I tell Safari to always open links that want a new window in a new tab?  I know I can use cmd-click to do this but that's not what I want.   There has to be a setting somewhere?    <answer4315> You can use Safari preferences (kbdâŒ˜ ,/kbd) to change this setting, you can use automatically or always for opening pages in new tabs instead of new windows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v7Srv.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer4316> In safari preferences (command + ,) on the "Tabs" tab you can set this options.   Or you can right click the link and choose the option you want. Or depending on your current configuration command + click on the link could open the link on a new page or a new tab.
