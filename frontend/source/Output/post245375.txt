How does apple's EFI compare to the UEFI standard? <body> Apple's EFI in macs were the first implementation of EFI by Intel but then Intel revised their work and made UEFI for PC's which is newer and possibly better. I wanted to know if Apple's EFI has been receiving updates through the years or is it outdated compared to UEFI ?   <answer245422> The Apple EFI firmwares are always automatically updated when you update the version of an OS or upgrade the OS.
