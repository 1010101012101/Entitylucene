Settings on Mountain Lion Server for Publishing Calendar <body> mountain lion server offers the possibility to publish calendars. Such a calendar (I assume an ics file) could be published on a webserver that could be hosted on the same mountain lion server. Everything could be fairly easily done via iCloud. But let's assume that I would like to publish a calendar on my own hosted osx server and that I would like allow access for a selected group of people only, who have an account on this server can access the calendar.  This triggered a few questions, related to the web server settings in server.app.   ul liWhat are reasonable settings in the server.app for 'Websites'  ul liwhat is a good location to store the calendar files (should they be straight under '/' or in a dedicated folder at a certain location in the directory)?/li lithere is a setting for "Who can access" -- will this be sufficient to allow access to only the selection of users that I would like to have access?/li /ul/li licurrently, I have a static IP via dyndns. Based on what I currently understand, the dyndns URL can be used as a domain name? How would it be possible to have the calendars be available under a sub-domain (something like 'www.hiddencal.server.dyndns.org')?/li liwhich ports need to be open? Would this be a security issue? And what could be done to minimize issues?/li /ul  Are there other settings / things that I should consider?
