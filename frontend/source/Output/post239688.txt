How to transfer movie from android to ipad <body> I have a movie on my android external sd card. I would like to transfer it to play on my ipad. What is the simplest way to do this?  I have a very slow internet connection but both computers are on the same wireless LAN, if that helps.  <answer239698> I think this can help  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3g4P.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liDownload Shareit app on both the devices./li liClick the send button on your android device and receive button on the iPad./li liSelect the file you want to send and it creates an hotspot and click the receiver's name/li /ul  Usually, this sends the files with blazing speed if it's a movie so it should be completed in 1 or 2 minutes. Hope this helps.  <answer269720> Here's another method:  ol liDownload Airmore on your Android and iPhone./li liAccess their site then connect your Android first./li liGo to Files -- ExtSDCard -- search for the movie file./li liCheck on that and click Export./li liAfter that, connect your iPad and go to Videos then click Import. Select the exported file./li /ol  You're good to go after that. :)  <comment294264> Does it require an internet connection to work? Also on the ipad side, which app will it then be available to?  Just the built-in movie viewer? <comment294267> no internet connection is needed <comment294268> You just need an internet connection to download these apps <comment294270> Sounds great. But once the file is transferred, the ipad sandboxes everything so would you be able to play the movie from a 3rd party movie player for example? For example, goodplayer. <comment294271> yeah you can play it through any player on your device <comment294273> Sounds perfect. I will give it a go thank you. <comment294274> let me know if this helps <comment294283> did it worked for you
