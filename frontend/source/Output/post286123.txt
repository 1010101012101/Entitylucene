iBooks and Notes crashing on startup <body> I installed the iOS 11 Beta, then downgraded back to iOS 10.3.2. I restored to my iCloud backup and everything looked alright. However, I am having issues after the restore, some of which include:  ul liBackups of Whatsapp conversations will not restore, as it thinks I am not connected to iCloud, despite being listed in iOS Settings./li liiBooks and Notes crash on startup./li /ul  Any help is appreciated!  Thanks in advance  <answer287024> Same here on an iPad, plus iCloud Drive app was saying I need to enable iCloud Drive, but it's already enabled.   I managed to fix the iCloud Drive app problem.   ul liSwitch off Settings-AppleId Account-iCloud-iCloud Drive/li liReboot/li liSwitch on Settings-AppleId Account-iCloud-iCloud Drive/li /ul  Nor ibooks nor notes got fixed.  Any hints with ibooks and notes crashes are welcome.  <comment361152> same here . . .  i guess it's about document scans. Do you have some on your notes ? <comment361217> @ArsenSench  nope <comment362342> After restoring iPad and restoring Backup, notes and iBooks seem to be working again.
