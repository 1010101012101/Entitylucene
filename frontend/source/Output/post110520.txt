How to bring iPad's 5 finger pinch functionality to iPhone <body> On the iPad, a 5 finger pinch will bring you to the home screen. How can we replicate that function on iPhone?  <answer110542> It's not possible to configure this five finger pinch gesture on an iPhone without jailbreaking it. Currently there are no jailbreaks for iOS 7 (see jailbrea.kr for available jailbreaks).  If the iPhone is a device with a version of iOS that can be jailbroken, then this can be achieved after a jailbreak using codeSBSettings/code and codeActivator/code (both installed through the Cydia app store). You can even assign custom gestures, like for example, a three finger pinch or a four finger pinch, for this action.  <comment130196> That's not possible
