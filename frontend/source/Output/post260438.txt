Macbook Pro is Excruciatingly Slow <body> I have a Mid 2012 Model Macbook Pro, nearly 3 years old, and my computer has recently become extremely, stupidly slow. It's becoming hard to perform simple tasks on the computer, like opening a Google Chrome Page, opening any app on my computer or even switching to a different application via the dock. I use this computer for school, however much of my classmates (who have the same model computer) aren't having the same problem as I am.  Usually, it takes about half an hour for my computer to start up and log in, and another half an hour to get everything set up on my desktop (as in loading up desktop, dock, menu bar and letting the computer speed up and stabilise). Below is an image of my Activity Monitor:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7lEEx.png" alt="Image"  I have nothing on my desktop as of now. My Downloads folder is rather full, and I still have 200 GB of storage out of my 500GB remaining. I can't figure as to why it is this slow, and I know it's not because of my internet connection because I have a second Macbook Air laptop (relatively new) that runs at beautiful speeds.  What should I do about this?  strongSpecifications:/strongbr Macbook Pro (13 Inch, Mid 2012)br Processor: 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5br Memory: 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3br Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MBbr Storage: 500GB total, 200GB remaining    <answer260441> Troubleshooting is a process of elimination, so you will need to try a number of things one by one and take note of the results.   strongStart in Safe Mode/strong  First of all, try starting your MacBook pro in Safe Mode and testing to see whether you still suffer the same sluggishness in performing typical tasks.

Take a note of the results and report back.

Furthermore it modifies low level functions of the macOS, what can cause dangerous consequences.  Test.  <comment326082> You can try to upgrade the memory to 8GB or 16GB because it looks like you used up most of the memory on your computer, and it starts going into swap file. For slow startup and other performance issue you can try upgrading the drive to an SSD. <comment326083> Can you please share what version of macOS you're running? Also, it'd be good to provide a second screenshot showing the CPU tab of your Activity Monitor. <comment326086> Alright I'll try these out now. Thanks! <comment326087> My macOS is currently Sierra Version 10.12 <comment326108> After trying all of what you suggested, I found that resetting the SMC improved start up time by a large amount. However the computer still freezes and works incredibly slowly once it has fully logged on. Resetting the PRAM doesn't appear to have done anything, and performing in safe mode is just as painfully slow as normal. I performed a hardware diagnostics test with the extensive testing box checked, however the test found no problems with hardware. The SMC reset helped startup time and smoothness, but once the computer reaches the desktop, it seems to slow to a halt again. Any ideas?
