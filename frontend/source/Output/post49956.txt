How do I find hidden UIScrollView settings in Safari and Lion? <body> The question (and answer) Can you disable rubber-band scrolling in OS X Lion? is very useful, so I would like to learn how to find these settings.  How can I find out what these variables are so I can turn them off without needing to find a question here one by one?  <comment69987> This has had some flags as a dupliate, but all the duplicates have been focused on the end result - what to type - as opposed to the process of uncovering hidden defaults. Do we have that question on the site? If so, please flag for removal / merging.
