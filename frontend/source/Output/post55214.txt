What's the services/running processes manager in Mac OS X? <body> I installed MySQL but I am unable to see if it is running or has stopped. How do I see what are the currently running services corresponding to the "Services" interface in Windows?   <answer55218> The application "Activity Monitor" is located in /Applications/Utilities and will display all processes similar to the Unix command 'top'.  <answer55220> For most of the "services" (called Daemons or Agents) you can check:  In terminal: code$ sudo launchctl list/code  For example only MySQL you can filter the output of the command above, like code$ sudo launchctl list | grep -i mysql/code. Note code-i/code is to make the filter case insensitive.  These can be controlled with a GUI named Lingon.  There are some other "services", that will install themselves in:  precode/Library/StartupItems /code/pre  For those, there is a command like  codeps -ef |grep /Library/StartupItems/code to view whether it is loaded and running. But there isn't a generic mechanism to stop, start or restart.  In which category your MySQL installation falls is impossible to say, as your question is lacking details on what exactly you have installed, what its source is, how it was installed, etc..    <answer111154> you can use top in the terminal in osxâ€¦ I am surprised there is no command line service manager in osx. Wow!  <answer144451> No, cat concatenates or displays /dev/null  which is the bit bucket or nothing so codecat /dev/null/code shows me nothing.  Try codeps -ef/code on the command line. This will show you process status everything full  To just see MySQL run  precodeps -ef | grep -i mysql /code/pre  <comment130826> Doesn't `cat /dev/null` show you all windows services that run on OS X? <comment361810> Note: By default it'll only show processes you own. You should switch it to show all processes in the `View` menu.
