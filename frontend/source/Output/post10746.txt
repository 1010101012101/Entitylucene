Is there any AirPort product that supports to receive audio streaming and share a hard drive on USB? <body> My impression is that I need both an Airport Express for sound, and an AirPort Extreme for sharing the hard drive.&#1;  Is this true, or there are alternatives?  <answer11262> Your impression is correct. AirPort Express's USB port does not support hard drives, and AirPort Extreme doesn't have an audio output jack:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1SRlr.jpg" alt="enter image description here" title="click to embiggen"  Sucks, don't it?
