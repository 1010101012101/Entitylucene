Finder search multiple file types <body> I want to create a Smart Search Folder that will contain code.xcproj/code emor/em code.xcworkspace/code files.

For reference, this is the custom query that I've used:  codekMDItemFSName == *.xcodeproj ||kMDItemFSName == *.xcworkspace/code  <comment321717> Look at [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/135705/88313).
