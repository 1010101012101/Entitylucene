How can I position windows with the maximize button? <body> I was watching this video when the instructor was able to position a window by using the maximize button and clicking on one of four positioning options, as seen in the image below.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PMf4a.png" alt="enter image description here"  This was also emnot/em specific to the program, as it was done in different windows for different applications.  strongIs this a native OS X feature? If so, which settings were enabled? If not, are there known applications allowing for this feature?/strong  <answer141660> This looks like Moom which Is available from the App Store   http://manytricks.com/moom/  <comment166940> This is exactly what is seen in the video. Thanks!
