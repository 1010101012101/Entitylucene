Equivalent to "Protected View" and "Enable Content" in MS Office 2016 for Mac? <body> I have been provided with a "form" to fill out in MS Word format. I have MS Office 2016 installed on my mac, and supposedly I am supposed to be able to click "Enable Content" to be able to fill out the form. However, there is no "message bar" on MS Word 2016 for Mac where this button is displayed on the Windows version. Is there a way to do this on a mac?
