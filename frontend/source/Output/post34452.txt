OS X Lion Connection to Business network? <body> I have a client that wants to connect an OS X Lion macbook air to his business network remotely, and I was just wondering if anyone knows of a way to do this easily. Normally, I would set up a VPN server and allow for a connection in this way, but that is not a process I can recommend to "less techy" people. Is there an easier (while still secure) way to set up a business network connection remotely? Thanks beforehand.  <answer37235> You could try programs like Hamachi or even Teamviewer which now supports VPN. They both have easy to use installers for the less tech-savvy.  Otherwise if you have access to a Mac computer, you can create(export) a network preference file which can be double-clicked to automatically load the VPN settings.  <answer44355> I don't see a reason not to set up a VPN. You can add the VPN menu to the status bar and your client can simply select their VPN and enter a password when prompted. It's no more difficult than say, a TeamViewer connection setup. (In fact, VPN is arguably easier, since the system stores your username and merely prompts for a password. TeamVewer requires an ID and a password.)  I emjust/em began using VPN this week, and it's super easy. Really. To add VPN to the status bar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGzZ7.png" alt="Add VPN to Status Bar"  Then, your client can simply click to connect, like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFksM.png" alt="Click to connect to VPN"  sup(VPN info blurred for security reasons.)/sup  <comment50428> I fully agree with you. The VPN setup in Lion is quite easy.
