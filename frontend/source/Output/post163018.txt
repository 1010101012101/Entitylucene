How do I convert from Case-Insensitive to case-sensitive in 10.8 <body> I just got a new (well refurbished) MacBook Pro running 10.8.3. I am a programmer, so I have need of a case-sensitive filesystem. It is fresh and I am reluctant to upgrade it or do much with it until I can change the partition to be case-sensitive.  To be sure, I ran "diskutil info disk0s2" on it. Under filesystem personality it says "Journaled HFS+". Which I understand to be the case-insensitive format.  I have done a little research and supposedly iPartition can do it, but I am reluctant to buy it because I think it can be done without spending money. Even if it is a more complicated method. And because I just got it, so I am not afraid to reinstall Mac OS X if need be. I would just need a way to do it without a disk.  So, what is the quickest and easiest way to make the partition case-sensitive?  <answer163100> I've run in to this before and the only solution I'm aware of is to reformat your file system. Here's what I suggest you do:  ol liBoot off of your OSX install media and use Disk Utility to clone your OS image on to another drive./li liReformat your main drive with the file system you want/li liRestore the contents of your backed-up system to the main drive./li /ol  You could also go largely through Time Machine for this, but I'd recommend going straight at Disk Utility.   Here's a random link to someone's article on cloning a drive with Disk Utility.  <comment190777> I bet if you create a Time Machine backup or boot from the installer (and run Disk Utility), you can make a backup of the current system, then format your drive how you want it and load the backup image. BTW - I once installed Case-Sensitive HFS, because, as a developer joining a project, I thought I needed it.. Caused all my builds to break and produced headaches until I reformatted as case-insensitive. <comment190778> @Doc What kind of builds where you doing? I am a web developer. So I generally deal with Unix/Linux systems anyway. I have actually had headaches caused by using case-insensitive systems before (Windows and in one case a Mac). <comment190780> By the way, you should make that an answer to this question so that I can vote it up and possibly use it as the choice answer if I go that route. <comment190797> Why exactly do you need case sensitivity? Usually Unix ports were the main reason and these have mainly been converted to build OK <comment190870> I am a web developer. I deal with case sensitive files quite often. <comment190881> I was working on a cross-platform C++ application. I do a decent amount of web development now and I've never had a problem with case-insensitive HFS+, though, I'm not developing for OSX (Linux is my target) and thus I don't run web applications on OSX <comment190947> I will have to look up how to create an install disk from within the OS since it did not come with one. <comment190948> I will probably just use VMs for it. I will think about it more. Maybe I can just stick with the VMs for it. I have just always preferred working with case-sensitive formats. It especially avoids problems you can sometimes have when committing to git, hg, or svn (**shivers**). <comment274384> pthurmond It's pretty easy if you google it for your version of OS X. <comment340441> This is not recommended if you use any adobe products, they simply won't install on case-sensitive fs on osx. <comment340513> That seems like a ridiculous mistake in design. But I do remember using Adobe Acrobat on one awhile ago. Maybe that has changed.
