iPhoto opens automatically by creating files on Desktop <body> strongMy problem:/strong  iPhoto opens automatically, when I:  ul liCopy and paste any kind of file to my Desktop/li liSave any file type to my Desktop/li liCreate a screenshot (which is automatically saved to Desktop)/li /ul  iPhoto doesn't open when I:  ul liMove any file type to my Desktop/li liCopy and paste a file anywhere in documents (not Desktop)/li /ul  According to this I think the problem is with emcreating a file on the Desktop./em  strongWhen the problem first appeared:/strong  I tried to create a shortcurt to an application and looked through several blogs. I ended up in creating a test-service, which launches iPhoto. I wanted to map that service to a shortcut, but it  didn't work out...   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ik9Hu.png" alt="photo of automator application"  strongWhat I've tried so far:/strong  ul liI've deleted the service I've created./li liI went to System Preferences  Keyboard and "Restored all Defaults" in each category for all the shortcuts./li liI've unchecked every Service in the System Preferences./li liI went through the Preferences of iPhoto./li liI searched Google for like 3 days./li /ul  Does anyone has any clue how I can fix this behavior?   strongEdit:/strong  Sorry the confusion: the behaviour hadn't anything to do with the service I've created. It was a Folder Action assigned to my Desktop.  <answer76893> Maybe the service is saved somewhere else? As far as I know, they go into ~/Library/Services/ (you can go there by switching to Finder and press Shift+Control+G or select "go to folder" in the Go-To-Men√º).   Maybe you saved your Automator script as "Folder Action"? Have you checked them, too? I think they are visible as a submenu when Control-Clicking on the Desktop.  <answer76896> Look in the folders  ul li~/Library/Scripts/li li~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Automator/li /ul  if you can find that automator script or workflow with the service where you included iPhoto.   Maybe it got corrupt or something.  <answer76900> Have a look at Folder Actions Setup.   You can open this by right-clicking on any folder in your home folder, choose "Services  Folder Actions Setup ...".    You can also find it here: /System/Library/CoreServices/Folder Actions Setup.app  <comment89195> Have you thought about re-installing iPhoto? <comment89196> Yeah - but how do I manage reinstalling it without paying the 15$? <comment89198> How did you originally get it? Have you looked in the Mac App store under "Purchases"? If iLife came installed on your computer, it should be available for re-download via the Mac App store. <comment89199> Thanks for the answer - the service was saved in /Library/Services, but I deleted it. Unfortunately, I don't see any "Folder Action" when I control-click the Desktop... <comment89201> It came installed on the computer. When I open up the App Store I can see iPhoto under my purchased apps. However I don't see anything like a button the redownload the app which is described in here: http://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/How-To-Re-Download-Apps-From-The-Mac-App-Store.htm <comment89202> Should I just go for it? ;) <comment89203> I guess I don't see any reason why not (I just hate for there to be some major issue during the un/reinstall process). I just tested it by deleting the Evernote app. I then rebooted and under Purchases in the App store I had the option to "Install". I re-installed Evernote and all worked well, so un/re-install iPhoto *should* be easy. <comment89292> You got it right! It had nothing to do with the service I've created. I launched the Folder Actions Setup and was able to delete another iPhoto.workflow I've created before I set up the iPhoto service.
