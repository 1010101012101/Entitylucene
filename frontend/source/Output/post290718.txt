How to get in DFU recovery mode when your phone is looping in recovery mode? <body> So I understand how to get into DFU mode when the phone is off. However, the problem is that I can't figure out how to actually turn the phone off because it's looping in recovery mode.  Long story short -- I was running iOS 11 and wanted to downgrade back to iOS 10 and thought I was in DFU mode, but was in recovery mode, so the restore failed.  Getting in DFU mode also suggests that to release the power button after seeing the Apple logo screen, but in this recovery loop, what happens is that the APple logo appears for a split second, followed by the "plug into itunes" screen.   Any luck would be greatly appreciated.
