Remap keypad 1 to line end <body> As a long-time Windows developer that has to use OSX just for Xcode and apps, does anyone have a way to remap keypad 1 to the equivalent of Windows num-unlocked keypad 1 [end]? I've tried Karabiner and can see how to map home/end in the 6 buttons above the arrows, but not how to do the same for keypad number 1.  I'm constantly inserting number 1 into the code because that's where my little finger has been trained to unconsciously go!
