Mac app to show hard drive consumption/usage? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How can I find more disk space?       Is there a program or app that i can use to tell me where all of my hard disk space has gone? I'd like a graph (pie chart) if possible, but I prefer free/low cost over the aesthetics of such a program.  <answer13454> DaisyDisk should suit your needs. It costs $19, but has a free trial available. Paying for the app gives you:   ul liNo "nag-screens", badges or overlays/li liAll functions, including the in-app deletion, are available/li liFree updates/li liPriority support by e-mail/li liOne license can be used on multiple Macs/li /ul  So registering isn't exactly emrequired/em and there isn't a time limit, but there are some features that you don't get with the free version.  <answer13456> Disk Inventory X is a great tool for this. While its not a pie chart, it is a visual graph of your usage, as well as relative sizes to other files. Colors are also used to group like files together. I have used this a few times to find what was using up extra disk space.   Its free too.   <answer13467> I've been using GrandPerspective for several years now and been very happy.  <answer13468> WhatSize is my tool of choice and has a free trial. If I didn't need the extra functionality it allows, I would also check out a free trial of DaisyDisk. Although it's more focused on pretty animations and presentation than full function (at this point in it's life), there are advantages to getting DaisyDisk through the Mac App Store. GrandPerspective makes my head hurt but I know many people who swear by it instead of at it.  <comment14243> Saved again several GB thanks to it this week. Don't just run it once but do it from time to time. Also, I had to use the beta version on my SnowLeopard MBP. The one proposed by default just crashes at launch. <comment14244> Yah, pretty sure it hasn't been updated in a while except that beta to run on newer machines. <comment14245> If you're comfortable with the command line/terminal, `du -hs *` will get you far.  Even better, the same command will work on just about any *nix system. <comment14250> This did the trick for me! I may register eventually. <comment173420> I've tried a number and settled on DaisyDisk. Fast and well designed with a UI that "just works".
