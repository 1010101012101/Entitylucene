iOS Alarm app Labels stored in iTunes Backup? <body> I can't seem to find any iTunes Backup extraction utility that claims to be able to extract data from the pre-installed iTunes codeAlarm/code app (specifically the labels that are in each "alarm"), so cannot have complete confidence these are backed up despite the Apple webpage on backups not stating that they aren't.   So how can I extract these labels from a backup?  <comment289921> I really don't understand what you're asking. Can you please ask a question instead of saying you should've used the app that was made for reminders. (Which is also called reminders) <comment289927> [IronCraftMan](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/143445) - Perhaps I needed to put the subject line of my question's text in the questions, also. The question is in the sentence ending with the `?`.
