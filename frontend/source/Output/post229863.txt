Item: "Documents", Kind "Unknown" in Login Items <body> In my Login Items on Mac OS 10.11.3 I see an item called "Documents". The Kind is specified as "unknown" and there is a yellow warning sign at the end of the line.   No further information is shown when I hover or click the warning sign or the item. I checked the loginwindow.plist, but couldn't see anything relating to the item in question.  I don't want to merely clear it out.   Does anyone know what this item is supposed to do and how I could further inquire what is wrong with it?  <answer236056> Somehow or another it sounds like your Documents emfolder/em was added to your startup items. I emthink/em this used to be a way to have the Finder open a specific folder on login, but it hasn't worked that way for some time.  It is not serving any purpose now, and there's no reason to keep it.
