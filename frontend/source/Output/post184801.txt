How to prevent "Look Up" functionality from showing link previews? <body> As you know Apple just updated the look up function and added previews of the link you highlighted. As a non-native I often use look up to see the meaning of a word. When the word appears as a link, or within a link highlight shows the preview instead of dictionary.  I was wondering if there is a way to switch between them or disable preview options.   <answer184821> No definitive answer, but I do have a workaround for you.  Select the link including a whitespace before or after it, then use the look up function on the whitespace part of the selection.
