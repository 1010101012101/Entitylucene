Can I watch a video on my Mac but have the audio go through my iPhone? <body> I would like to get the sound from my MacBook Pro to play on my iPhone. For example if I watch a video on my Mac I would be able to view it on my Mac but get the audio through my iPhone. Is this possible?  <answer117302> Yes, you can do this with Airplay if jailbroken. If your application cannot do this by default, you could use a program like AirFoil / AirFoil Speakers - you only have to be connected on the same wifi network.  This is something I use in my own situation.  <answer117311> Yes, you can do it.  You need to be on the same WiFi network and use a pair of matched applications on your Mac and iPhone.  The best known of these are Airfoil (for the Mac) and Airfoil Speakers Touch on your iPhone. See this: http://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/  Note that Airfoil Speakers Touch strongdoes not/strong turn your iPhone into Airplay speakers so you can only stream to it from a computer running Airfoil and not, for example, your iPad.  <comment137093> You can't use Airplay unless you jailbreak the iPhone. Apple does not allow any app that runs the iPhone into an Airplay **target** rather than source. <comment137094> @TonyWilliams as I said, AirFoil can do this and I'm using this without Jailbreak. As long as you're on the same wifi network it will work. <comment137096> That's **not** using Airplay. Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil uses AirPlay where available but actually does it's own streaming to Airfoil Touch on iOS devices. <comment137140> Thank you for the answer. Airfoil worked decently but the delay of about 3 seconds made it unusable for watching a video. <comment137154> That's pretty bad lag. I think I got mine down to less than a second and could adjust that out inside Plex and VLC.
