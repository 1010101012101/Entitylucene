Import multiple photos from Dropbox to iMovie? <body> I have a lot of photos in Dropbox on my iPad mini that I would like to upload in one go to iMovie.  So far I can only figure out how to export to iPhoto, then I have to import to iMovie. Not very convenient or fast! Any suggestions appreciated.   <answer136684> If you have a PC/Mac and use iTunes, it would be a lot quicker to do this using the File Sharing feature for apps.  Here are the steps to do this, taken from the Apple iMovie help documentation at "iMovie Help for iPad: Import from iTunes":     ul   liConnect your device to your computer, then open iTunes on your computer.  /li   liIn your iTunes library, select the device near the top of the iTunes window./li   liClick the Apps button./li   liSelect iMovie in the Apps list below File Sharing (you may need to scroll to see it)./li   liDo one of the following:   ul   liDrag the file you want to add to the iMovie Documents pane./li   liClick Add below the iMovie Documents pane, and in the window that appears, navigate to the file you want to add./li   /ul/li   liTo copy the file to your device, select the file, then click Open./li   liThe file appears in the iMovie Documents pane when copying is complete./li   /ul
