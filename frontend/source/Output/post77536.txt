I need to download Lion again... thanks  <answer77539> I suggest you to do a complete backup with time machine, then formatting, install lion and restore all the data (including application and preferences) from time machine backup.  If you cannot download lion from app store, you have to search it on the web....  <comment89856> Do you want to turn this into "under what circumstances can I re-download the Lion installer?
