How do I get rid of errors for disconnected networked drives? <body> Every time I log into OSX 10.9.4 (and several slightly older versions since I've been updating) I get several pop-ups asking me to connect to a remote/networked drive that I've previously configured, yet deleted:  precodeEnter your name and password for the server "my_remote_server". /code/pre  ..followed by the error about connecting, but that's fine because the drives have been deleted on the server side, so there should be no way to actually connect.  There is a pair of pop-ups per drive/server (each drive has its own server, and I configured several drives). I also get a similar message when opening my Chrome browser.   I removed these drives (using Finder-Go-Connect to Server) and the problem is still there. I've also checked code/etc/fstab/code, code/Volumes/code, and used the codedf/code command although that's pretty much the same as checking fstab.  It appears that the drives are completely disconnected/unmounted, so the problem is that I'm still getting the error pop-ups. I tried this but it didn't work: http://whatsamknows.tumblr.com/post/37368603810/get-rid-of-server-connections-interrupted  How do I fix this?  <answer140454> If it's every time you log in, it could be in your login items. Check System Preferences → Users &amp; Groups → Login Items for links to those volumes.  <comment165550> no idea why this was downvoted. have +1 on me <comment165551> are you using LDAP? <comment165553> I'm really not sure, how do I find out? I did all of this stuff a long time ago and I'm finally coming back around to fix it :) <comment165554> Under 'Login Items' there were some rows with my directory, and they each had a little yellow warning symbol next to them. Deleting these rows fixed the problem
