Applescript - the activate command makes application "half-active" <body> strongWhat I did:/strong  Using this link,  I created the following Applescript:  precodetell application "System Events"     click (first button whose subrole is "AXZoomButton") of (first window whose subrole is "AXStandardWindow") of (first process whose frontmost is true)     set frontApp to (name of first application process whose frontmost is true) as string     tell application frontApp to activate end tell /code/pre  This code allows me to "press" the green button at the top left corner of the window.  I run the code, using Alfred.  (Mountain Lion 10.8.4, Alfred 2.0.6)  strongWhat happens:/strong  Zooming works fine, but  ol lithe zoomed window of the application loses focus./li lithe three buttons, red, yellow and green, at the top-left corner of the window are all dimmed in grey after running the code./li lithe menu bar still shows the application title, indicating that the application is still foremost./li /ol  (In this sense, the window is "half-activated"?)  If I click the window, those buttons go back to normal, showing red, yellow and green.  strongWhat I want:/strong  I want to keep focus on the zoomed application window after running the code using Alfred.  Can anyone help me out, please?  <answer98203> Move the codeactivate/code command outside the codetell application "System Events"/code block:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)     click (button 1 where subrole is "AXZoomButton") of window 1 end tell activate application (path to frontmost application as text) /code/pre  Or you could probably just remove the codeactivate/code command completely.  <comment115358> Your code worked perfectly. Thank you so much (^o^)/
