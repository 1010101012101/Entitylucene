Can I sync drafts to gMail from iPhone mail? <body> I have gmail set up via exchange. My drafts aren't syncing back to the server. Should they be? Is there a setting somewhere?  <answer28240> No, this is limitation of GMail via Exchange on iOS.  The only way to have draft support is to use the GMail template when adding a new mail account.  <comment32435> in which case, you don't get push. :( <comment32437> that's absolutely right
