Updating L2TP over IPSec VPN Server Address from Terminal <body> Is it possible to update the VPN server address from terminal?  I've tried updating the server address on code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist/code... but if I do so and then run codenetworksetup -connectpppoeservice &lt;servicename&gt;/code it still connects to the old server.  OTOH, if I open system preferences and initiate the connection from there, the new configuration is picked up...  Is there any way to change the VPN server address AND initiate a connection to the new server completely via terminal?
