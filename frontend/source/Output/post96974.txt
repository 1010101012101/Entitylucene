How to export to HTML in Keynote 09 <body> I've created presentation in Keynote 09. Now I want to export it to HTML, but without navigation buttons. After selection Share  Export - HTML I see only option to select movie quality:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ao8s0.png" alt="enter image description here"  On Apple forum I've found some instruction on how to configure my export:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TYmOM.png" alt="enter image description here"  Unfortunately I don't see these all options. Do you have any advices how can I get access to these settings in Keynote HTML export?  <answer96983> Keynote (with iWork 09) does not have Flash options/features in the export to HTML they were available only up to iWork 08. Hopefully someone will be able to tell you how to edit the HTML Keynote now creates so that the navigation controls are not shown.  <comment113792> Can you please add a screenshot of the window you see after selecting "Share-Export-HTML" (see [How do I upload a picture here](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1744/how-do-i-upload-a-picture-on-here) for details)? <comment113796> I've just uploaded screenshot to the url http://imgur.com/C60Cr9I <comment113831> Thanks for the information. I'm able to manually edit generated HTML code, so it's not a problem.
