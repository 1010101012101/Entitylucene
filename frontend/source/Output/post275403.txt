Deleted iCloud Backup and now Manage Storage doesn't show anything <body> I just deleted backups from my iPhone 5s and now it doesn't show anything at all from my device, not even what my next backup would be. Will this change with time, or do I have to manually tell it to automatically back up iCloud?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YxBMW.png" width="320"  <comment346439> If you deleted the backups, what are you expecting to see here?  If you go to `Settings - iCloud - Backup` it should show you when your last backup was. <comment346443> @Icon Please make your edits worthwhile; your new title still did not summarise the problem. <comment346455> Sorry @grgarside. I'm a proofreader by trade. I can't let typos slide. Sometimes I clarify the intent of what is being written, but sometimes not.
