Did I expose myself to information-theft via possible malware on iPad by opening an e-mail in Safari? <body> I received an email from cdhhospitals.org/upload.htm and opened it. I immediately was redirected to a waiting screen. I immediately closed the Safari app.    I tried to track this site down and the search states that this site may damage your computer.  Did I expose myself to information-theft or anything alike?   <answer60002> It appears the site is distributing malware. If you opened the page on your computer you should first install a good antivirus/antimalware program, try Sophos which is good and free. If it was on your iPad (as your tag suggests) there's probably a bit less cause for alarm as there is currently no known virus which can infect an iPad.  Next it's probably a good idea to change all of your passwords, most importantly your AppleID as it stores your confidential information and credit card data. You can manage your apple id here.  <comment69147> Does this actually do anything on Macs, or is it only a Windows problem? <comment69148> Depends on the malware. A virus can be written for mac just like it can be written for windows. <comment69179> My question was supposed to refer to the cdhhospitals.org thingie. <comment69182> Without downloading the malware myself, removing my own antivirus software in order do so and thus potentially exposing my own computer to infection in order to analyse it, I cannot tell you. All I can tell you is that the site is distributing malware of some kind. <comment69302> It is OK to say you don't know.  I was wondering if perhaps someone here did know the details about this particular site.
