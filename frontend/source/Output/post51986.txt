Why does my Terminal command line screw up like this? (bash's fault?) <body> When I use the command line history ( kbdCtrl/kbdkbdR/kbd , kbdCtrl/kbdkbdP/kbd )  The command line screws up like this:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKWPZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  The cursor is supposedly located at the end of the line ( just pressed kbdCtrl/kbdkbdE/kbd )    If I press enter, just codesource ~/.bash_profile/code is executed, the rest is just rubbish on the screen.br Although it works as it should, I'd like the terminal to not  be visually broken.  edit: This is my PS1: codePS1="\033[0;31m[mac] \033[0;37m\w\033[1;36m&gt; \033[1;0m"/code  <answer51992> It's most likely an issue with what you've set your PS1 to in your .bashrc or .bash_profile.  Specifically, I'd expect it's related to incorrect escape sequences.    Here is a link with more information.  It's hard to tell exactly without seeing what your PS1 is set to.  <comment59530> Oh that's probably it. I updated the question with my PS1. Although the colors show correctly, the escape sequences may be wrong. <comment241287> Your PS1 *seems* fine. Set it as mine and used command line history to bring up `source ~/bash_profile` as you described and it worked without issues, but I'm bad at reading those escape sequences manually, so there still could be an issue there that just didn't take effect due to other differences in out setups.
