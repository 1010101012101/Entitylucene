iCloud is stuck on uploading items and no longer syncs <body> I got the macOS Sierra update when it went into public beta, and I've been trying to use the automatic Desktop / Documents upload feature with iCloud. I've enabled the feature, however since September 7 no files have been uploaded. By this point, the bottoms of my finder windows say:     15.78 GB available on iCloud, uploading 156,106 items (543.2 MB of 543.2 MB)   However the files are never actually uploaded. I keep my screenshots folder on my desktop and I take a lot of screenshots, so I can see that September 7 was the last date any file was actually uploaded.  What should I do? Is there a way I can disable and re-enable the feature without risking loss of data? Are there any solutions to this problem? What should I try? So far I've tried rebooting, and tried software update to macOS 10.12.2 public beta.  <answer264916> Happened to me as well, here is what I did:  ol liBack up all items in the strongemDocuments/em/strong and strongemDesktop/em/strong folders/li liOpen up strongemSystem Preferences/em/strong/li liClick on strongemiCloud/em/strong/li liClick on strongemOptions/em/strong next to strongemiCloud Drive/em/strong/li liIf strongemDesktop and Document Folders/em/strong is disabled, enable it/li liIf it enabled, un-enable it./li liUncheck the strongemOptimize Mac Storage/em/strong and click strongemDone/em/strong/li liRedo the opposite of this to re-enable iCloud/li liMove all strongemDocuments/em/strong and strongemDesktop/em/strong items back to their respective area./li /ol  It is helpful to note if you are experiencing sync issues in any of the other categories in strongemiCloud Drive/em/strong, try disabling them and then re-enabling them.  <answer272826> Have you changed the date and time on your computer or phone? This is a possible explanation of why iCloud is not syncing.  <comment332122> Since not all items are backed up won't this cause a loss in data? It displays a warning about how documents will be removed... <comment332276> @LukeTaylor I don't think it should wipe anything from your local storage, and when you turn it back on, it will start the sync again, replacing all duplicated files. <comment332278> Unchecking the box brings up a warning that "if you continue, items will be removed from the Desktop and Documents folder on this mac and will remain available in iCloud Drive". It's kind of ambiguous about how it will treat unsynced items. <comment332288> @LukeTaylor, In finder, do you see the iCloudDrive on the top left? Click on it and let me know if your files are inside the documents and desktop folder <comment332292> They are, but I haven't yet disabled the iCloud sync for these. Most of them have the ☁️ icon indicating that they haven't yet been uploaded. <comment332298> @LukeTaylor Interesting, can you by any chance backup your data to an off-source location such as a hard-drive or another cloud option such as Google Drive or Dropbox? <comment332300> Turning off and on didn't help. All of iCloud drive is stuck, as it turns out. I've tried relaunching finder, etc. I'll edit my question. <comment332323> @LukeTaylor When you say "relaunching", I assume you force-quit and let it relaunch? Can you try moving all desktop and document items to a temporary new location that is not affiliated with Desktop or Documents. If the syncing message does not appear, move all items back into their regular place and let them sync. If it does appear, toggle it on and off like my solution above suggested. Let me know how it works out. <comment342923> They're all correct. I rely on those times and dates daily, I'd know if they were off.
