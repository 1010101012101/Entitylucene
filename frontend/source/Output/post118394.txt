Spotlight search in OS X Mavericks 10.9.1 crashes when indexing mails in Mail app <body> (Note, this is a cross post of https://discussions.apple.com/message/24066877#24066877 in case someone in this community can help a lot of the people with Mavericks Spotlight problems - I've read all the posts on the stack exchange forum too)  emstrongLong story short; Any idea at all why spotlight keeps reindeing, crashes and never finishes?/em/strong  strongBackground &amp; Symptom:/strong  Since upgrading to Mavericks my Spotlight haven't been indexing and searching properly. My main issue is Mail app because I search there 30-50 times a day but I can see the symptom is also there with searching for Apps or files. I've tried absolutely everything, been Googling and been on chat and phone support with Apple (still have time left on my extra warranty) at least 20 times and must say its shown no results so far.  strongDetail:/strong  I've got 2 drives in it - 1 HDD and 1 SSD - everything OS, Apps and Mail is on the main SSD drive and I've even tried to have spotlight just index that but to no avail.  It worked prior to the upgrade from Mountain Lion to Mavericks.  I can see in console that my mds_stores crashes constantly (which maybe explains the behaviour) - maybe ~20 times a day.  The main thread that crashes is codecom.apple.metadata.spotlightindex/code but there are a couple of others too rarely (codeMDSSecureStore/code and codecom.apple.libdispatch-manager/code)  The other thing they all have in common is this message:  precodeException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) /code/pre  and 50% of the codemds_stores/code crashes have this in common:  precodeException Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000100000001 /code/pre  Here's some of the things I've done (and some of them many times in various orders):  ul liReinstalled OS X Mavericks bare and reinstall/repaired on top of the existing install/li liMoved a lot of the IMAP mails into local folders/li liTried different user account/li liUninstalled all kinds of stuff on the machine in case anything of that was the culrit/li liSpotlight reindexing (both by dragging my drive into the spotlight exclusion as well as via the command line mdutil commands etc)/li liTurned off FileVault (had to in order to get into Safe Mode)/li liReset NVRAM (⌘⌥PR)/li liHave repaired disk permissions/li liHave rebooted in safe mode (⇧)/li liHave rebooted in Recovery console and run resetpasswd/resetpassword and fixed ACLs/li liTried disabling everything but my mails in spotlight (Mail app)/li liLots of other things.../li /ul  strongAny ideas at all?/strong I had to write here because I've run out of options and I have on faith that Apple can sort it out (its been more than a month of open support cases).  <comment206032> Turned out this was caused by some OS X instabilities Sophos Anti Virus. It was a "known" issue too apparently. Since then I've been using Avast and its been working fine.
