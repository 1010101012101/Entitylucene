Toggle Natural scrolling from command line with reload <body> I'm looking to make a script that quickly toggles the Natural scrolling settings, so I need a way to do it from the command line.  I think I found the correct defaults command, but I'm not sure how to apply it without logging out. Here is the command I'm using:  codedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences  com.apple.swipescrolldirection -bool/code  <answer60878> The same setting is visible in the Magic Mouse and Trackpad panes. This works if you have a Magic Mouse connected (but not if you do not):  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "mouseTab" of pane id "com.apple.preference.mouse" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     click checkbox 1 of window 1 end tell quit application "System Preferences"' /code/pre  This works if you have a trackpad:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Preferences"   reveal anchor "trackpadTab" of pane id "com.apple.preference.trackpad" end tell  tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     click radio button 2 of tab group 1 of window 1     click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 end tell  quit application "System Preferences"' /code/pre  nb: the "Accessibility Inspector" tool that comes with Xcode can be used to locate UI items to click on.
