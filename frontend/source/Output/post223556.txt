iPhone "Speak" is wrong: how to disable / remove languages? <body> "Speak" is wrong.  My iPhone international/languages settings are only: strongEnglish and Japanese/strong.  However. sometimes in Messages for instance, for some reasons the "Speak" feature reads Japanese as Chinese...!  And the Japanese text is clearly Japanese .... (for instance it contains pure-Japanese hiragana).  Chinese is nowhere in my settings, Text is clearly Japanese, "Speak" shouldn't talk Chinese.     Is there a way to disable/remove any Chinese language from the "smart text recognizer" / Accessibility / Speak options ?
