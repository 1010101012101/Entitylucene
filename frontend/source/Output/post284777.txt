Unlock my iPhone <body> I forgot the PIN code of my iPhone 5S; I tried many times to unlock it and I finished to block it indefinitely. I haven't got any backup files and before resetting it I want to recover all my photos. Is there a way to unlock it or at least save my photos?   <answer285177> On this link there are a few ways to unlock iPhone. Maybe some of these are fit for you
