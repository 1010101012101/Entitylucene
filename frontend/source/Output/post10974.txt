Print .docx without Pages.app <body> Sometimes I simply want to print Microsoft Word documents. If I view them in Quick Look, they display as I would like to print them. However, when I try to print them from the Finder, it opens Pages.app and the rendering is significantly different.  Is there anyway to print the document as Quick Look renders it?  <answer10977> You can open Word documents with the built-in TextEdit app.  It will display and print them the same way (as far as I can tell) as QuickLook does.  <comment11562> So it does. I was thrown by the fact that QuickLook doesn't show page breaks.
