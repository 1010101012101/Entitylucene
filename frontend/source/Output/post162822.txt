HyperSwitch alt+tab broken? <body> HyperSwitch kbdAlt/kbd+kbdTab/kbd behaviour stopped working 2-3 days ago. It simply does nothing. I haven't changed my HyperSwitch's preferences and I don't remember installing or updating anything that would create a conflict. However cmd+tab window preview is working, so the app is clearly up and running.  Is anyone experiencing the same problem? Or everything works well? I have already contacted the creator of the app to get some support.  Meanwhile, is there any free app with the same kbdAlt/kbd+kbdTab/kbd window scrolling feature?  <answer162833> No idea what feature you are looking for as I've never used HyperSwitch and their website doesn't show much.  For a "better than Apple's" Application Switcher, I use LiteSwitch X. If you want one that switches between windows instead of full Applications, try Witch  <answer260651> After months of digging I found out what was my problem. As I visited this page like a million times I'll leave here my story as it may be helpful  My issue was related to the new "Secure Input" feature of os x. When Secure Input is enabled, apps like HyperSwitch, Contexts etc... will not be able to grap hotkeys.  Some app may be bugged and not release the secure input lock, or (like in my case) you may have some issue with Iterm2. In this case just disable it, Iterm2 menu - Secure Keyboard Entry and you have your life back!  <comment190482> what is LiteSwitch X really? Witch is paid, I asked for free options... @Insomniac <comment190515> LiteSwitch is very similar to the built-in app switcher but a bit customizable.  Change the window color, show background apps, quit an app, etc.  Only windowing options are to show all windows or just the front-most window when switching.  If you want a switcher that shows the windows and lets you pick a specific window, you would have to try Witch or get HyperSwitch working again. <comment193411> I see the same behaviour, do you got any feedback from the developer? <comment193581> I have no answer yet
