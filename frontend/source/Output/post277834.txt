Should I keep my login Keychain locked? <body> I only recently discovered that I can lock and unlock the keychain, but I can't understand if I actually need to keep it locked, because if I do, I constantly am asked to enter my password and unlock it by different services, essentially making it impossible to keep it locked. On the other hand, I like the idea of locking the keychain for things like ssh keys and whatnot. Am I doing something wrong?
