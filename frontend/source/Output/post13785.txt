Google sync with iPhone causing incorrect dates on phone <body> If I add a event in Google Calendar the time comes out wrong on the iPhone.  When I add an event on the iPhone the time on Google Calendar comes out wrong but the date is right?  Anyone got any ideas?  <answer13786> You can set the timezone in both the iPhone and Google Calendar.  In Google Calendar, it's in the first page of the settings.br In the iPhone, it's in codeSettings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendar &gt; Time Zone Support/code (at the bottom).  You should set both in the same timezone, then see if it fixes the issue.  <comment14674> Wow its strange that you have to set the mail timezone and it is different from the clock time zone but nevertheless thanks very much! <comment14676> @thelearner actually, I shorten the the title, it's "Mail, Contacts, Calendar". It has nothing to do with mails. Sorry for the confusion, I've updated my answer. <comment14693> yeah I got what you meant, my only issue is why would I need to set the region for mail and then set the region for time - surely there should only be one setting - Apple weirdness <comment14721> @TheLearner wait till you travel to another timezone, then you'll see weirdness... :P
