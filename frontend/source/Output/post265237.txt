Corresponding ipfw rules in MacOS for this Iptables rules <body> I need to give Internet access to a VM under Vmware fusion 7 in Host-Only mode. I know how to do it in Linux, with the following IPtables rules:  precodesysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1  iptables -A FORWARD -o eth0 -i vboxnet0 -s 192.168.56.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE /code/pre  But I can not find out how to do it in MacOS Sierra. Any help?  Thanks in advance!  <answer265298> To enable NAT for a host-only network in VMware Fusion do the following:  ol liEnable forwarding by adding a file /etc/sysctl.conf with the content:  precodenet.inet.ip.forwarding=1 /code/pre  and reboot/li liConnect the Mac to the host-only network and make a note of the network/netmask of the host.only network:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kMK3j.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liEnter codeifconfig/code to get the vmnet IP of the Mac   precode... vmnet3: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500         ether 00:50:56:c0:00:03          inet 192.168.9.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.9.255 /code/pre/li liIn the IP setting of the guest VM enter an IP/netmask according to the host-only network settings (with the example above that's in the range 192.168.9.2-254/255.255.255.0), a gateway (the IP of the Mac from step 2) and a DNS server./li liOpen the pf.conf file with:  precodesudo nano /etc/pf.conf /code/pre  and add the lines:  precodenat on {en0, en1} proto {tcp, udp, icmp} from 192.168.9.0/24 to any -&gt; {en0, en1} pass from {lo0, 192.168.9.0/24} to any keep state /code/pre  after the line coderdr-anchor "com.apple/*"/code.  Depending on your Mac and your network configuration only one interface is sufficient (either en0 or en1). Also use the proper network/netmask (your vmnet config instead of 192.168.9.0/24)!.  Save the file and exit nano./li liCheck your pf.conf with:  precodesudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf /code/pre/li liIf no error occurs enable pf with:  precodesudo pfctl -ef /etc/pf.conf /code/pre/li /ol  hr  After a reboot you have to relaunch pf because it's not started automatically while booting. To launch pf while booting check step 4 in this answer: What is the modern way to do port-forwarding on El Capitan? (forward port 80 to 8080)  <comment332568> Your question is unclear. What's the VM's operating system? And why don't you use VMware Fusion's nat-mode? Because enabling nat via pf for a host-only network **is** (more or less) nat-mode! <comment332569> The VM's OS is W7. I need the host-only mode to create a private network to execute safely samples of malware. <comment369216> Works well with Virtualbox and ''Host-only Adapter" mode
