Not booting from USB, blank boot option menu <body> I've recently rebuilt a 2009 MBP back to working order and bought an optical drive HDD replacement, however after installation when I wished to install windows onto the other drive I held option during boot and found the menu was completely blank. (i had the cursor but that is it). I read somewhere resetting the NVRAM solved the problem but it didn't work and on restart the MBP would boot at all USb or either HDD, i've since put the optical drive back in but still no success  Any help greatly appreciated, thanks.
