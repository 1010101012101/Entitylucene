Stock notifier for OSX <body> I am looking for a stock notifier for osx (macbook pro). Is there anything available ? Perhaps, integrated with Growl or Osx notifications.   <answer59236> How about the iStock widget for your Mac's dashboard?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7Lga.png" alt="enter image description here"  An other option is StockMeter which has Growl support indeed and you can install it in the menu-bar of your Mac, so you've got fast access to the data.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i1dbr.png" alt="enter image description here"
