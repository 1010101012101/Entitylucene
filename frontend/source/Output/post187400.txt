Safari broken, cannot install any extension <body> My safari refuses to let me install any extension. All installations ended up with a message:     Safari can't install this extensionbr   An error occurred while installing the extension &lt;extension name.   I have tried at least 2 dozens of unrelated extensions from safari extension page. Restart safari many times. Nothing works!  What can I do? Can I reinstall Safari? If I reinstall Safari, how do i ensure the passwords that are saved by Safari are not lost?  I am using OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 on rMBP 15â€³ 2014 model.  <comment221485> I'd start with the basics - Disk Utility, fix permissions & repair drive. Reinstall 10.10.3 from the [combo updater](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804?viewlocale) Let us know how it goes... <comment221539> Done the fix permission and drive repair - there are some permissions fixed and drive is perfectly ok. Also tried to reinstall 10.10.3 from the link but got a page not found error. So far still the same, can't install any extension. <comment221542> my bad - I tried to clean the 'nationality' from the link & failed :( try https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804? <comment222794> Sorry, it doesn't work after I install the OSXUpdCombo10.3.3. Still have the same problem. <comment222895> I reinstall OS X from the recovery and it is still not working. I really hate to reinstall the whole MBP from scratch up... <comment222899> Finally fixed it by deleting the extension directory in ~/Library/Safari... it is probably due to my Kaspersky safari virtual keyboard extension. Thanks to this link https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5144452 <comment222915> Glad you got it :)
