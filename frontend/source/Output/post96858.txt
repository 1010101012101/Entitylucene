How do I enable "mouse trails" in OSX? <body> I have a lot of screen real estate, and am constantly "losing" my mouse.  I'd like to have a simple way of easily finding the mouse that doesn't have to be reconfigured when I undock from my 28 inch monitor and rely on my retina display.  Windows has a feature that allows for "mouse trails" so I can easily find the pointer wherever it is.  How can I get similar functionality on the Mac?  I looked under the "accessibility" tab but found nothing.  <answer96866> There's no built-in option for that. You could try HotMouse for $0.99 in the App Store, or OmniDazzle (free) if you're really feeling crazy.  <answer96868> Under Accessibility - Display there is an option to make it larger, and thus easier to find.  Otherwise, go with one of Tortilla's options.  <answer251389> I use Pinpoint from the app store.  <comment303285> None of these exist as of July 2016.  Simple Mouse Locator ($0.99) is available though.  Hard to believe mac doesn't have this baked in though. <comment303286> As of 10.11.5, this option no longer exists. <comment303450> 10.11.5 has the 'Shake mouse pointer to locate' under the Display set of options in Accessibility. <comment312490> Welcome to Ask Different.
