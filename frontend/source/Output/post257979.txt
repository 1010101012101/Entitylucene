macOS Sierra mousewheel inertial scroll <body> Seems that macOS Sierra now comes with some kind of inertial scroll when using the mouse wheel; scrolling slowly does not scroll at all and scrolling rapidly builds up momentum. I find this very annoying (mostly the not scrolling at all part), even more when using parallels or vmware.  Has anyone found a way to disable this and bring back the none accelerated scrolling?   Thanks  Note: you can disable the inertia for the strongtrackpad/strong under emSystem Preferences/em code-&gt;/code emAccessibility/em code-&gt;/code emMouse &amp; Trackpad/em code-&gt;/code emTrackpad Options .../em
