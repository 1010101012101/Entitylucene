Message: The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer when inserting SD card <body> I did a video shoot a while ago using a 32 Gb hama sd card on a canon 5d. When i went home and inserted the camera on the card reader I got the following error:  “The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer” . When I Insert the card to either my canon 5d and 7d I get the following message: Card cannot be accessed. Reinsert change the card or format card with camera.  Also worth to mention is the fact that i looked back at the footage during the shoot and it was all there. The card was full towards the end of the shoot, and i had to replace it, but i accidentally took first the battery off while the camera was still on. (I think that is what has caused the problem).  my specs:br 15 -inch mac book pro (2,6 Ghz Intel Core i7) Yosemite 10.10.05  What should i do? I really need this footage! Any ideas / or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
