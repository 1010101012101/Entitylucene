HDMI 2.0a Flakiness on late 2016 MacBook Pro <body> If I plug in the USB-C to HDMI 2.0a adapter for my TV it doesn't work until I reboot Mac OS Sierra into Windows 10 on my Bootcamp partition, then reboot it back into Mac OS. Sometimes if I shut the laptop down completely instead, and then turn it on, it works. What's the deal here?   The adapter is by" UpTab". I tried another adapter by "Club" and it's worse than the UpTab, since it does the exact same thing but repeatedly loses signal in Mac OS. This does not happen in Windows 10 though, same adapter.  I am not so sure it's the adapter, since it works consistently and is not at all flaky with Windows 10. It's only flaky and problematic in Sierra.  This must be a Mac OS problem.  UPDATE: I discovered that there are NO adapters currently that support the EDID queries that Mac OS uses to connect to all displays. The proprietary nature of the method they use to send signals is inherently flaky and requires a bit of shutting down, rebooting, closing the lid, opening the lid, saying a magic word, waving your hand and then repeating the process. Eventually it will work but not until these things are done a few times.  Thanks Apple for sucking so hard.   <comment329493> One of the reasons I am a bit scared to get 2016 Macbook Pro. I just got me a new shiny 27" and I don't see how I can connect it.  Those chinese HDMI Adaptors only output 1920x1080 which is not enough for 27". <comment329875> There are HDMI 2.0a adapters that convert USB-C, the problem is there's only 2 right now and both are a little flaky with Mac OS.
