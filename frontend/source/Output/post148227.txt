Label view on Apple Mail for OSX <body> I'm using Apple Mail on OSX (Mavericks). Since I'm accustomed to use Gmail webmail, which shows labels behind each email, I'm looking for a way to show labels (see for instance picture below) in a similar way on Apple Mail.  Is it possible (I assume some plugin may exist)?br/ If not, are there other mail clients supporting this labels functionality (i.e. Mail for OSX Yosemite)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1JQYm.jpg" alt="Gmail label sample"  <answer148231> Google uses Labels instead of folders, so in Apple's mail the messages with a given label will appear in a folder with that given labels name (assuming the codeShow in IMAP/code option is selected in Gmail's Labels setting for any given label).   If this doesn't work for you you may want to try out http://mailplaneapp.com for your gmail/os x needs.  <answer152489> Take a look at MailTags from http://indev.ca/MailTags.html - it'll show Gmail Labels in a separate column.  <comment174715> Maybe the question is not clear: my purpose is to show labels next to each email, as in the picture.
