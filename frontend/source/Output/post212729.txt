Where is Safari Reader CSS or HTML in El Capitan? <body> In OS X El Capitan, Safari Reader View file for modifying the CSS is no longer found in Safari application and in code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Safari.framework/Versions/A/Resources//code.  Where is it located?  Is it locked by System Integration too?  If there is no way to modify, I think in downgrading to OS X Yosemite.    <answer220122> I tried codemdfind -name Reader.html/code and on my copy of El Capitan it yields the following path:  code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SafariShared.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Reader.html/code   So it looks like the file has indeed been moved.  <comment256829> If the file is protected by SIP, then you can disable, edit the file, and re-enable SIP. <comment256832> Isn't the file `Reader.html` inside that folder? <comment256846> I have already searched all the folders and I didn't find.
