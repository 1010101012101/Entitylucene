How to make ⌘⌫ delete a line of text in Messages? <body> The shortcut kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌫/kbd normally deletes a line of text in a text field. But in the new Messages app in Mountain Lion, this is the shortcut for "Close Conversation…" (or, if you choose "Save history when conversations are closed" in the preferences, it's "Delete Conversation…").  Is there a way to disable this shortcut such that kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌫/kbd can again be used for deleting text?  <answer57737> I use kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdLeft/kbd to select all the text on the line and then hit kbd⌫/kbd. To select all the text, I'd substitute that with kbd⌘/kbd + kbdA/kbd.  It's not perfect, but it works.  strongEdit:/strong  Based on CanuckSkier's answer, I've gotten the delete conversation message tobr go away with the following command on the Terminal:     defaults write com.Apple.iChat NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Close Conversation…" nil   It's also a little cleaner than using the System Preferences method, because you have no command instead of an extra obscure one.  <answer57743> You can change the shortcut for "Close Conversation" to something else, that should avoid the conflict. To do this, open Keyboard Preferences, and then go to the "Keyboard Shortcuts" tab. Click Application Shortcuts, then the + button to add a new one. You should get a popup like this one (I'm still on Lion, but I don't believe they changed much): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IMokn.png" alt="New Keyboard Shortcut"  Change the application to Messages, enter the proper menu title (if it uses an ellipsis, you may have to enter that exact character — not just three periods — by hitting kbdoption/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbd;/kbd), then enter in a shortcut you're unlikely to use.  It's also possible to disable a keyboard shortcut from the command line, rather than just setting it to some obscure command. However I haven't tested this on Mountain Lion or Messages app, so no guarantees.  If you're comfortable with the command line, the proper command would stronglikely/strong be codedefaults write com.apple.Messages NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Close Conversation…" nil/code. However I don't have access to Mountain Lion, so the com.apple.Messages part is just a guess. You may want to test first by trying codedefaults read com.apple.Messages/code and see if it pops up with an error. It should spit out a long list of plist-formatted preferences, if it doesn't the app identifier (codecom.apple.Messages/code) is probably wrong, so you'll need to do some digging to find out what it is.  emAgain let me stress that I haven't tested this second option on Mountain Lion or Messages at all, it's just based on how things work in previous versions of OS X./em  <answer57744> Control-K deletes the selection, or if there is no selection to the end of the current line. This works in any true Cocoa text view.  <answer58463> Open System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts.  Quit Messages if it is opened. Click the code+/code at the bottom of the list on the right. In the pop-up, select the “Messages” application, enter codeClose Conversation…/code (with proper ellipsis, as @CanuckSkier stressed) in “Menu Title”. In “Keyboard Shortcut”, type kbd⌥⇧a/kbd, for example. We'll redefine the “a” right after.  Open code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.plist/code with your favorite text editor (it can even be TextEdit), and look for (kbd⌘F/kbd) codeNSUserKeyEquivalents/code. You should find the string code~$a/code somewhere nearby, which is our encoded previously-defined shortcut. Simply replace the “a” with the special character “⌫” (you can copy-and paste it from this post). Save the file.  This should do the trick to define kbd⌥⇧⌫/kbd as the shortcut  :)  <answer73955> ol liQuit Messages./li liOpen a terminal window and do:  precodedefaults write com.Apple.iChat NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Close Conversation…" nil /code/pre  Note that's a real ellipses character, either type kbd⌥/kbdkbd;/kbd or just copy/paste from here./li liRe-start Messages.

(And for that, instead of ⌘⇧↑, I'd use ⌘A.) <comment66384> Well, that or left. <comment66386> @jtbandes Edited Command + Shift + Left selects the entire line. <comment66387> Ah, I see what you mean. That's a valid substitute but I'm going to keep hoping for a real solution :) <comment66388> Ok, cool. Good luck. If I find anything, I'll post it. <comment66393> Is it possible to use the ⌫ key in a custom shortcut? I'm having trouble using something like ⇧⌥⌫. <comment66394> There's no opposite (delete to beginning), is there? I guess to use this I would have to do ⌘←, ⌃K. <comment66401> Just hold down the delete key? Command-Shift-Left selects to the beginning of the line, then delete or control-K or control-H. <comment66402> See my answer, just gotten it to work. It's com.Apple.iChat. <comment66416> Did you really get this to work in Mountain Lion? I tried but it seems to automatically change the shortcut to "L". <comment66417> The Terminal method is a great idea, but doesn't work. It seems to automatically change a `nil` shortcut to "L". <comment66434> Really? Didn't try pressing l. <comment66436> Seems to work, didn't try pressing l. <comment66438> I don't think anything happens when you press L, but it shows up as L in the menu. <comment66439> Try pressing n+i+L <comment66440> If you look in System Preferences, it does list any `nil` shortcut as L, but that's just some quirk in System Prefs, pressing L shouldn't activate anything. The exception is in some cases (seems to be when you install a new version of an app), it will reset it so that L actually activates the item, in which case just execute the `defaults` command again. <comment67221> pressing "nil" or just "l" doesn't activate the shortcut. It seems text entry takes precedence. Still it makes me uneasy to have it set to any shortcut at all, rather than no shortcut... <comment67222> After some more thinking I realize that it's not showing a `nil` shortcut as L — the shortcut cannot actually be nil because nil isn't a valid object in property lists. It's actually using the string "nil" and apparently it just takes the last letter. <comment67248> Downvote for completely changing the answer based on someone else's one. Either make a new answer or suggest editing the other person's one, but you can't take someone else's answer without even understanding it (_“press n+i+l”_, really?!). BTW, nothing personal, it's just a matter of etiquette. <comment67303> @jtbandes You're probably right. Something like `defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add Minimize foo` would also appear to disable the shortcut in most applications. In some applications like Audacity it would be shown as F though. A better way to disable shortcuts might be to set them to `'\000'` or something like a zero width space (`'\U200b'` or `&#x200b;` on XML property lists). <comment67357> @MattiSG - I totally wasn't serious with that, but I'm not trying to be rude. Also, I actually confirmed that the other answer worked on Mountain Lion. The other poster couldn't confirm that their answer was indeed applicable. <comment85915> Thanks to Moshe, MattiSG, and CanuckSkier for putting me on the right track. Unfortunately there was no single answer here that had just the correct information in a simple, straight-forward form. <comment100004> What an awesome idea. I also used this for Cmd Delete in Preview too. Why in the world would I want to delete the document while editing a text field?? Anyway, thank you. I replaced Close Conversation… with an obscure shortcut like you suggested.
