Terminal/iTerm Autocomplete "greyed" functionality? <body> Not too sure how to describe this... but I saw this on a person's computer a cafe today and didn't get a chance to ask him what plugin/application he was using --  I think it best to illustrate with an example:  Say there's a directory with three folders, 'kitty', 'doggie', and 'frog'.  Typing codecd f/code would make the letters coderog/code appear after the 'f', but coderog/code would be in a lighter color of text (a greyed color) -- it was a sort of "visible autocomplete", not sure what else to call it. Anyone know how to achieve this? Thanks.  <answer140766> Sounds like like iTerm2 feature.  See this for complete list of Features including the Autocomplete and Highlighting.  <answer140770> This is a feature of the codefish/code shell (Friendly Interactive Shell).  img src="https://fishshell.com/assets/img/screenshots/autosuggestion.png" alt="Image of feature"  codefish/code's scripting syntax is also quite a bit different from codebash/code and codezsh/code's. If you use codezsh/code, you can also try the codezsh-autosuggestions/code plugin on Github.  <answer277843> There is also a plugin for oh-my-zsh: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions. It explicitly aims at Fish-like functionality.  <comment166031> Thanks. Do you know if there's anything like this for `bash`? <comment166063> [I don't think so](http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1z7cne/does_bash_have_an_autosuggest_like_fish_screenshot/) unfortunately.
