iOS Whatsapp delete ALL media, keep chats <body> There must be a way to delete Whatsapp media (photos AND videos) but keep the chats. The only thing I found is backing up the chats to iCloud and then reinstalling whatsapp but that also backs up my 600mb of photos.  Is there any way to get rid of the pictures? I have them backed up to my laptop already, why does Whatsapp think I need them?
