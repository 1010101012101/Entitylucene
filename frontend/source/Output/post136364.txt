Can I tell itunes to download a specific podcast on Saturdays only? <body> So there is this one podcast I like but I only want to get the episodes published on Saturdays. Is it possible? They publish a podcast everyday but I am only interested in the ones that are on Saturdays.   <answer136557> You can use the following AppleScript:  precodetell application "iTunes"     set aList to every track of playlist "Podcasts" whose album is "podcast_name"     repeat with aTrack in aList         set aDate to release date of aTrack         set aWeekday to weekday of aDate as string         if aWeekday is equal to "Saturday" then             updatePodcast aTrack         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  I would save this AppleScript as application and execute it whenever you want:  ol liOpen the application "AppleScript Editor" in the Utility folder./li liPaste the code above./li liSet "podcast_name" to the name of the podcast you want to update./li liSave the Apple Script as application./li /ol  To schedule this AppleScript, you can get hints at the tutorial I found.
