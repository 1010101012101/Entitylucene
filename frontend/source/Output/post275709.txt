Why is my Mac listening on port 625? <body> My Mac is listening on port 625. This listing by Apple of common ports used by macOS and Apple software claims that it has something to do with Open Directory. However, my machine doesn't have any sharing services on or is connected to any Open Directory services.  The service listening on this port is launchd, so it's likely a system service.  Any idea why this could be the case? What purpose does this listening connection likely serve?

To see all launchd events, open terminal, and paste this codelaunchctl list/code if that doesn't help, type codesudo launchctl list/code to see what the root user is launching.   <answer275823> Port 625 is used by the codeopendirectoryd/code daemon. This is the daemon that is in charge of talking to the directory system. The most common two purposes you might use it's services are for authentication, it looks up accounts and passwords, and for service discovery, it keeps an eye out for servers and such like on the network.  Disabling it would not be a good idea. If you use codekill/code or codekillall/code to kill it then codelaunchd/code will just respawn it.  <comment346879> Did you install Server.app and allow remote server administration? Else: add the output of `sudo lsof -i :625` entered in Terminal to your question. <comment346880> @klanomath Nope. I've never added the macOS server app. I'll add that to the question. <comment346980> additionally one could grep through the launch d files like in this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21711431 <comment347017> Could you tell us what version of OS X you are running and what leads you to believe there is a service listening on that particular port? <comment347023> @TonyWilliams 10.12.4 Beta. I've updated the question with the output of lsof. <comment347025> Yeah, opendirectoryd is in `launchctl list`. I wonder why that would be the case. Should I just disable it? Would there be any side effects to it?
