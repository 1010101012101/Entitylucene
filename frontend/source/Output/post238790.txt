Apple Script to Apply Rules in Mail.app <body> ul liI've created some rules in my strongMail.app/strong to change background color of specific messages/li liAnd also I've created rules in the strongmail server/strong to move specific messages to some folder/li /ul  For messages in the Inbox folder everything is fine.  But if message has been moved by server rule into another folder, then rules in the Mail.app do not apply (and for some twisted reasons this is by design: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19162?locale=en_US&amp;viewlocale=en_US).  And if I apply rules manually by hitting codeCommand + Option + L/code, then Mail.app rules will apply as they should.  I want to automate this action. Is it possible to achieve with Apple Script? Can you help me with it? The steps should be as follows, I guess:  ol liChoose Smart Folder "today";/li liSelect all messages in this folder;/li liPerform the action "Apply Rules" for selection./li /ol  pre using terms from application "Mail"         tell application "Mail"             set the message_count to the count of HOW-TO-GET-MESSAGES-FOR-TODAY-SMARTBOX             repeat with i from 1 to the message_count                 set this_message to item i of MESSAGES-FROM-TODAY-SMARTBOX                  tell this_message                  -- here goes something like APPLY RULES                  end tell              end repeat         end tell end using terms from /pre  h3Edit 1./h3  If it's not possible for Smart Folder, then I want to do it will all the messages in all mailboxes (or with messages in specific mailbox (or just for any new message regardless of folder)).  <comment292916> It's my understanding you cannot reference the smart mailboxes through AppleScript in that manner as they are not actually objects. If you try to find the word "smart" in the Mail AppleScript Dictionary it doesn't exist. All info re: mailboxes in the AppleScript Dictionary do not reference "Smart Mailboxes". If you run `tell application "Mail" to get mailboxes` you'll not see any "Smart Mailboxes" in the output.  Additionally at the filesystem level there are no `smart_mailbox_name.mbox` files like there is for actual mailboxes. You're going to have to take a different approach, if possible. <comment292933> @user3439894 well ok, not a problem, then I want to do it with all the messages.
