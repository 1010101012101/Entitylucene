Are finder tags case-sensitive? <body> OS X Mavericks introduced file tagging to Finder and the filesystem. Are these tags case-senstive? For example, could I have an codeApple/code and codeapple/code tag?  <answer196667> strongNo./strong  I am able to seemingly tag files with differently cased words by opening the codeGet Info/code window on each file in Finder. However after I save and close each window and inspect the tags for each file the tag that was saved first overrides the other differently cased tag.  ul liNote: this is with the default case-insensitive filesystem. I have not tested this on a case-sensentive filesystem./li /ul  <comment234980> What happens if you give it a try? <comment234981> @patrix When entering/searching for a tag it preselects an existing one even if they are a different case.
