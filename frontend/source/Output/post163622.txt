iTunes won't open after update <body> My iTunes will not open under my username after an update.  It pops up an error message saying "iTunes will not open. An unknown error has occurred (13001)".  However, I tried troubleshooting it from the Apple website and got no where except I know it works under a different user.  Can I fix my iTunes without having to delete it?  <answer163626> Reading this thread and this article, it seems as if your library is corrupt.    Follow the recommendations and instructions from the above linked official support article for error 13001.  <comment191617> What exactly did you update? <comment191628> My computer updated iTunes. <comment191630> I tried this which is how I discovered that iTunes opens on the computer under another user; however after that step I'm lost.
