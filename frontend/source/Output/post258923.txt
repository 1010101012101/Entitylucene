Will leaving an iPad in a dock on constant charge cause issues with its life expectancy? <body> We're about to place 2 iPads in a dock like THIS and have them constantly connected to the power.   I've heard from some manufactures that constantly powering an iPad can cause its life expectancy to drop significantly, and Iâ€™m not sure if they are scare mongering.  Is this true or do iOS devices intelligently manage their charge to avoid this?   <comment349107> Not a duplicate, but related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70639/can-i-keep-the-macbook-pro-retinas-power-cord-plugged-in-at-all-time/70650
