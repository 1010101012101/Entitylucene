IR won't activate screen on 10.8.3 Mountain Lion Mac Mini <body> I use my Mini for home theatre, but the IR won't active the screen.br Using Screen Sharing will activate the screen.br I see others have reported this issue with 10.8.2 that went away with 10.8.3. Alas 10.8.3 didn't cure this problem for me.br  Originally I suspected it was due to sleep/hibernate, but this looks to be false as I can ssh into the Mini and use it fine. Also I ran the Plex home theatre app under "caffeinate", and it didn't help.  strongPrior Research/strong: I have read many man pages, forums, articles (see refs at bottom). Tried many combinations of settings, but to no avail. I turn to StackExchange for guidance.  ul liMy previous Mini running Snow Leopard worked just fine, but I don't wish to install Snow Leopard on my late model mini./li liI have tried the NVROM/PROM reset 4 times. Hasn't helped./li /ul  h2My machine:/h2  Mac mini - Late 2012 - Software  OS X 10.8.3 (12D78)  Reference Sites:br Mac Mini won&#39;t wake after sleep with Mountain Lionbr  <answer95118> Don't know how to get the display to wake up using your IR remote, but @wuc provided a great workround since you said you can ssh into the machine.    Step 1: SSH into your Mac.  Step 2: Run this command: codepmset schedule wake "01/01/2012 20:00:00"/code (with a date of your choosing, of course).  Here's a bit of background on the new "features" Apple added to Lion and Mountain Lion that make it harder to wake up your display.
