Microsoft Office 2016 smb server file saving issues <body> I have a network with Macs and Windows PCs connecting to a server with the SMB protocol (CIFS with Macs). The users share files on this server. Some of the Macs have Microsoft Office 2016. If one of those users edits and saves a file on the server or creates a new file the rights will be code-rw-r--r--/code impeding others of ever reading the file. This occurs only with MS Office 2016, all files saved with a prior version of the package (i.e. MS Office 2011) have no problems.  Any ideas on how to change the rights MS Office gives to one of its own files on the server?  (The server is Linux Samba version Squeeze.)
