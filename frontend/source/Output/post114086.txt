How to prevent OS X's 'screen' command from resizing the terminal upon entry? <body> I usually run my terminal sessions in 132 character wide mode in iTerm.

Is there a way to prevent this?   <comment133782> use `tmux` instead, basically they have same functions, just tmux is more environment-friendly <comment133866> good suggestion, however getting tmux setup in other environments may not be doable in certain situations. <comment152897> search for info on configuring your ~/[.screenrc](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/html_node/Startup-Files.html) file to do what you need.
