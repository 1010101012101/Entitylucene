Aperture overwrites files with same name <body> My canon camera was setup with filename numbering to code0001/code. When the camera reached the code9999/code, it restarted the numbering to code0001/code. I didn't noticed the file names since I just import my picture with aperture.  Now after some time I figured out that the old files, like first code0001.jpg/code version is no more available and code0001/code is always the last one picture imported.  It looks like I lost a lot of pictures! Is weird!  There is anyway to get back all pictures out of aperture?  <comment191596> Aperture stores the photos in a folder structure so it's unlikely that anything got overwritten. Did you try to browse your photo library directly with Finder?
