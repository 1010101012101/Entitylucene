Apple Music: "For You" section not refreshing on iTunes 12.2 <body> I'm using Apple Music on two devices: MBP and iPhone 5. Got the problem that iTunes doesn't automatically refresh the "For You" section on my MBP, unlike the iPhone. The CMD+R doesn't work as well. The only way to get fresh suggestions and playlists in "For You" is to kill and restart iTunes.  <answer198536> ol liIn iTunes, open the dropdown menu for your account (to the right of the apple logo at the top of the screen) and select "Choose Artists for You."/li liOn the next screen (floating bubbles of "what you are into"), hit "next" without making any changes./li liOn the next screen (floating bubbles of "your favorites"), hit done. /li /ol  On my Mac, this refreshes the "for you" every time. Pressing the "new" button as suggested by others has no effect on my Mac.
