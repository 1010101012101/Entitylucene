How do I upgrade a mac mini from OSX 10.4.11 to 10.6.8 <body> I have an old 2007 mac mini that I am using as a media/music hub, and I'd like to be able to sync it with my iphone. But to do that I need to upgrade its old itunes (v8), but to do that I need to upgrade 2 steps from OS 10.4.11 to OS 10.6.8. How do I do this? thanks!  <answer79708> I believe your mac mini supports 10.6 snow leopard. So all you have to do is buy the snow leopard install disc like from amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Mac-version-10-6-3-Snow-Leopard/dp/B001AMHWP8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358911973&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=snowleopard), then plug the disc in and do the upgrade.
