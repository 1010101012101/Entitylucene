Why do some app spotlight results show the ".app" extension, but not all? <body> Even though I've explicitly set the Finder preference to display all file extensions, I'm still finding that some apps do not show the file name extension in their Spotlight result.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Raefu.png" alt="filename exts"  Here are some examples.  strongI'm running Mountain Lion./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RtQ3K.png" alt="skype"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sq56U.png" alt="word"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dIuEE.png" alt="sparrow"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5O8qZ.png" alt="notes"    <answer66406> It seems this happens when Spotlight indexes the apps before the setting to hide extensions was in effect. You should try reindexing applications to resolve this issue.  Go to the Privacy tab in Spotlight preferences and add the Applications directory to the excluded locations. This should remove all applications from the Spotlight index. Then remove it again from the excluded locations so Spotlight will reindex applications with the correct settings. After reindexing the ".app" extension should be removed from all results.  <comment76629> Could this be applications that specify a localized bundle name? So that the bundle name shows, as opposed to the file name? <comment78129> I was downvoting you because your answer was pure speculation at that point, which is better suited for a comment than an answer. <comment78130> OH - OK. Sorry I'm not familiar with this site's workings .. <comment78131> No problem, welcome to the site. <comment78134> This does not seem to work for me when I change the setting to show extensions and reindex all Applications. <comment94573> This question is very similar to [this one][1].     [1]: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/33378/app-extension-in-spotlight-or-alfred/33381#33381
