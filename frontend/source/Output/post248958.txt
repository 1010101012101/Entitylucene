Add permanant pronunciation to text to speech dictionary <body> Is there any way to add a permanent pronunciation to OSX text to speech dictionary?  For example: I would like the word 'mkdir' to be read as 'make directory' each and every time I use the "Start Speaking" service.  <answer249038> I couldn't find a solution so I wrote an automator script that does the job: Custom Text To Speech
