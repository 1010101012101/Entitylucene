Sync iPhone and laptop emails <body> I have an iPhone 5 and a laptop.  My emails used to sync (if I deleted them from my phone they deleted off my laptop). They no longer do that.  I have to delete off each device. When I try in iTunes to fix this it only has outlook for mail but I don't think I use outlook because when I went into it it didn't have my email address. Can someone help me? Not sure if this happened because of an iOS update.  <comment195338> depends on whether you use POP or IMAP. Only IMAP will synchronise across devices, POP treats every machine separately.
