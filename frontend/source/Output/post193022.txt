VMWare fusion and key mapping (ALT+SHIFT+key with FR keyboard) <body> I've installed strongKali Linux/strong under a virtual machine with VMWare Fusion, but I have a problem with the key mapping.  Indeed, I have a french keyboard, and the mapping of the key is perfect but for the characters we have through codeALT + SHIFT + [key]/code.  For example, lets take the emkey line/em with the numbers. This is the key mapping I should have and the one I get, according to the number pressed:  precodeNumber:              @  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  )  - What I should have:  Ÿ  ´  „  ”  ’  [  å  »  Û  Á  Ø  ]  – What I have:         ¦  ·  É  ¸  ´  ¨  ¦  È  ¯  Ç  À  ÿ  ° /code/pre  This is very annoying since I can't use code'[', ']' or '\'/code. I must either copy-paste one I find in the web, or use codeALT + Unicode_code/code.  I know this is possible to edit the key mapping in the VM settings. But this doesn't work, I can set the codeMac shortcut/code correctly, and map it with anything but those damn characters...  Any idea?
