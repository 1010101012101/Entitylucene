Flagged emails keep returning and won't synchronize between Apple Mail and Gmail <body> I've had this problem before and can't recall how I managed to fix it last time. I use Apple Mail to access my Gmail and normally flagged emails show up correctly. Starred emails in Gmail equate to flagged emails in Apple Mail and I can unflag an email in either Gmail or Apple Mail and it works.  But now I've got four emails that I can't unflag. They're not flagged in Gmail at all (although they used to be). When I see them in the Flagged folder in Apple Mail, they don't even have flag icons next to them but they're still counted in the number showing next to "Flagged". If I manually re-flag them and then unflag them, they disappear from the Flagged box. But then if I click into Inbox and then back into Flagged they show up again.  Any ideas about how to make these guys disappear for good?!  <answer237074> Here's one approach I found that appeared to work:  ul liFor strongeach/strong flagged email that won't sync  ul liMark it as "red" flagged in the Flagged folder (it should show in the Flagged folder even though it doesn't have a flag next to it)/li liA red flag appears next to the message/li liClear the flag on the message/li liThe number of messages in the Flagged box should be reduced by one/li listrongFully quit Apple Mail/strong (Cmd-Q)/li liRestart Apple Mail and the flagged message should remain unflagged/li /ul/li /ul  Note: you can select all the emails in the "flagged" folder at once and do this en masse.  As user @ohcibi confirmed, you emmust force quit Apple Mail/em for this to work.  strongFollowup:/strong I just ran into this issue again and this process didn't solve it. I believe it may be related to the "Important" tag that Gmail adds. I went into Gmail and unmarked the message as being "Important", and then followed this process. That fixed the problem.  <answer287048> @aardvark's approach didn't work for me.  However, a slightly modified version of it strongdid/strong work:  ol liFlag all emails that are in the Flagged folder but seemingly aren't flagged./li liQuit Mail using kbdCmd/kbd-kbdQ/kbd./li liRe-open Mail, those emails should still be in the Flagged folder, but will now have the flag./li liUnflag them and kbdCmd/kbd-kbdQ/kbd a second time./li liOn reload, they should be correctly removed from the Flagged folder./li /ol  <answer295182> I frequently had this issue, a real working solution is to fully Quit mail (kbdcmd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd) and opening again while holding kbdalt/kbd by clicking once the Mail icon.  <comment331511> The important part is to cmd-q apple mail. I tried the same approach without quitting mail and those pesky mails won't vanish (while the counter still decreases). <comment331569> @ohcibi Thanks for the update! I'll highlight that aspect in the answer and add a note. <comment358603> Do you mean "Force quit" (from Apple Menu-Force Quit), or "Quit" (command-Q, or Mail - Quit Mail) ? <comment358881> @NealYoung The second -- my wording wasn't clear and I'll adjust it.
