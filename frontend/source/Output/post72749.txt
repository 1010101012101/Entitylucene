Can the OS X keychain juggle two accounts for the same site? <body> I have a different passwords for:  ol licodewww.example.com/foo/login/code and/li licodewww.example.com/bar/login/code/li /ol  It seems as if the keychain only saves the passwords in relation to the emsitename/em as it does not make distinctions by the emsubdomain/em.  When I visit codewww.example.com/foo/login/code the keychain will save the password correctly, but when I visit codewww.example.com/bar/login/code afterwards it uses the password of the first page and doesn't let me create a new password for the subdomain.  Is there any solution to this problem?  <answer72796> No - you'll want a more full featured password manager like the one gentmatt recommended in the comments.  You could do some kludgey web proxy to give the subdomain a separate top level domain, but that's way more hassle than most would consider appropriate for solving the problem you pose.  <comment84481> Just as a side note: [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id443987910?mt=12) can store a different passwords for different domains, I guess it should also work for subdomains. Just create two logins and change the URL entry. It's currently on sale in the Mac App Store. <comment84531> @gentmatt well it seems to be a good app but I would like to manage to configure keychain correctly and use this. In keychain I create two logins for the two subdomains and place them in the "where" fields but it doesn't make any difference. It is as if it only checks the domain only. Is it actually is a subfolder in the domain? Is that important? <comment84538> I've edited your question in an attempt to attract more attention to it and make it easier to read. Let's hope someone around here will be able to help you. :) <comment84541> @gentmatt thank you for the edit. much better <comment84542> I see. I liked keychain and i wanted to stick with it.
