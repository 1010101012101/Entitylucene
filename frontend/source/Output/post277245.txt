iPhone 6 Plus Sounds Stopped Working <body> I've check all my settings, my phone is not in Do Not Disturb mode, but I cannot get my alert sounds (messages, phone calls, etc) to work. Only vibrate works. Toggling settings off and on does not work either.  <answer277247> If you can't play music either or listen to voicemails (to check the receiver and the speaker) then you have a hardware or software issue.  If you can play music and listen to voicemails, then you have a software issue or a configuration/setting mismatch with what you want the device to do.  Hardware issue - usually starts with eliminating software issues, but in this case observing the headphone port for damage might be a great quick fix.  Software issues, back up the device and test after restoring it and verifying the settings.  <comment348959> something stuck in the headphone socket? <comment348966> I've linked to some of the many settings that need to be checked. If you want to edit to list each setting you have checked - that might help us help you. Hopefully the broad HW/SW troubleshooting in my answer will help in any event.
