Fixing two user groups with the same ID <body> Suddenly, my home directory is in the group codemessagebus/code instead of the usual codestaff/code.br(I blame texlive for this, but have no evidence.)  The problem is that both groups have the same ID:  precode$ dscl . -read /Groups/staff AppleMetaNodeLocation: /Local/Default GeneratedUID: ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF00000014 GroupMembers: FFFFEEEE-DDDD-CCCC-BBBB-AAAA00000000 GroupMembership: root Password: * PrimaryGroupID: 20 RealName: Staff RecordName: staff BUILTIN\Users RecordType: dsRecTypeStandard:Groups SMBSID: S-1-5-32-545  $ dscl . -read /Groups/messagebus AppleMetaNodeLocation: /Local/Default GeneratedUID: CF898A47-EA83-4E18-AE17-C05E56FBC550 Password: * PrimaryGroupID: 20 RealName: messagebus RecordName: messagebus RecordType: dsRecTypeStandard:Groups /code/pre  strongWhat is the safe way to get rid of the codemessagebus/code group (or give it a different ID)?/strong br“Safe” here meaning of course that I don't damage my codestaff/codegroup.  <answer112630> Use the find command (and save the output listing. This may take a while)  emfind / -group messagebus -print/em   to ensure that ownership for files can be corrected later with a emchgrp/em command.  The following be used   emdscl . -change /Groups/messagebus PrimaryGroupID 20 10000/em  <comment132267> How would finddifferentiate between staff and messafebus, doesn;t it use the gid to find a group? <comment132317> The directory where the file resides as shown by *find* should help identify what it's group should be. For example, if there is a file in /Users/xxx it should belong to *staff* but if it is in /Applications then it can stay *messagebus*. A Time Capsule backup can also help, if available. <comment132319> but the data stored on the file is the gid ie 20 in both cases (or does HFS do somthing differnt to other Unix file systems) <comment132353> Thanks, the `dcsl` command was exactly what I was looking for. After a restart, the groups show up correctly as `staff`. @Mark was right though; the `find` did show all files with gid 20, so this were basically all my home files. No way to distinguish between them and the files that should actually have been in the `messagebus` group. <comment132776> I just ran into the exact same problem. What's texlive though? I'm not sure I have it. I'm running OS X Mavericks. <comment132796> texlive is a program suite for editing TeX/LaTeX documents. If you're unsure, then you probably don't have it. And maybe I blamed the wrong piece of software then :-) <comment132885> In that case, I suspect the problem is caused by a recent (automatic) OS X update? Perhaps the Remote Desktop Client 3.7.1 (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6045), as that seems to be the latest update applied to my machine before I noticed the problem. <comment132898> Possible, but then I'd expect more people to have the problem. It seems rather rare. <comment143532> This happened to me. I think most users just aren't that observant of their file groups.
