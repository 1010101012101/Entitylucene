Spring 2010 MBP discrete GPU performace vs current MacBook Air? <body> I have been using a mid-2010 MacBook Pro with 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 8 GB RAM, 7200 RPM 512 MB hard drive, and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 512 MB discrete graphics card. After almost four years, I am considering getting a new portable Mac.  I am looking at the 13-inch MacBook Air, and my question is if its integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000 is at least equal to, if not substantially better than my current GeForce GT 330M in terms of graphics performance?  I realise the answer might be somewhat different depending on how you make the comparison, e.g. benchmark performance might not equal real-use performance. But is there at least a somewhat objective way to compare the two, especially considering one is several years older than the other?  I don't know if this will help, and I don't even do gaming that much, but suppose I install and run Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare on my current Mac and the MacBook Air with the same settings, will I experience noticeable graphics improvements on the MacBook Air? (I know loading times and other stuff might be better simply because of the SSD, but again I am asking about graphics performance).  Thanks!
