Automatically open mounted volumes in Path Finder <body> I may just be missing some simple setting, but if I mount a volume in Path Finder, it never switches to show me the contents of the volume.  I have to manually click the volume in the sidebar.  Is there a way to have it immediately switch to that volume after I mount it?  <answer4403> Not switching but show in a new window. Preferences-Browser-Open mounted volumes in new Window  <comment301250> That Preference no longer exists in Path Finder 7.3.3
