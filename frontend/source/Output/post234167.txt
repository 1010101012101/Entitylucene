How can I track progress of dd <body> I am using the following command to create a bootable SD Card  precodesudo dd bs=4m if=en_windows_10_enterprise_version_1511_x64_dvd_7224901.iso of=/dev/disk2 /code/pre  Is there a way to track the progress?  <answer234173> codedd/code itself doesn't provide a progress bar. You may estimate the progress of the dd copy process by adding a empkill -INFO/em command though.  Example:  precodedd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=64m count=1000 &amp; while pkill -INFO -x dd; do sleep 1; done /code/pre  Result:  precode[1] 37691 0+0 records in 0+0 records out 0 bytes transferred in 0.028923 secs (0 bytes/sec) 275+0 records in 275+0 records out 18454937600 bytes transferred in 1.029698 secs (17922667819 bytes/sec) 553+0 records in 553+0 records out 37111201792 bytes transferred in 2.048291 secs (18118129881 bytes/sec) 829+0 records in 829+0 records out 55633248256 bytes transferred in 3.068911 secs (18128009214 bytes/sec) 1000+0 records in 1000+0 records out 67108864000 bytes transferred in 3.720346 secs (18038339571 bytes/sec) [1]+  Done                    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=64m count=1000 /code/pre  Which translates to a whopping 18.1 GB/s.  <answer234208> The same information, displayed every second by in klanomath's answer, can displayed using your command. You just need to enter a kbdcontrol/kbdkbdT/kbd character from the keyboard while the codedd/code command is executing.  By pressing the kbdcontrol/kbdkbdT/kbd character, you are sending the same codeSIGINFO/code signal to the codedd/code command that the command codepkill -INFO -x dd/code sends.  <answer256663> As of coreutils 8.24, dd added a status options.  Install coreutils with Homebrew to update dd.  precodebrew install coreutils # All commands have been installed with the prefix 'g' sudo gdd if=XXXX.iso of=/dev/diskX bs=1 status=progress   &gt; example: &gt; 139648967 bytes (140 MB, 133 MiB) copied, 304 s, 459 kB/s     /code/pre  <comment286290> What are the hardware specs of the machine you ran that command on? <comment286294> @user3439894 3.5 GHz i7 iMac. Why? <comment286296> Was just curious because of the bytes/sec output, which by the way is actually 16.8 GB/s (rounded-up) as those are base 2, not base 10 calculations. <comment286327> This is nice, Easier Thank you very much <comment320163> [How to get dd to print transfer stats in MacOS?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20772392/how-to-get-dd-to-print-transfer-stats-in-macos) <comment338608> Didn't know about coreutils, very handy.
