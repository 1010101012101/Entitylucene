synching problem <body> I'v just upgraded to an iphone 5 after my old 4 died, battery dead and charging mechanism kaput, so not able to transfer data phone to phone.  Tried it on mac at home and it says I need min version 11 on itunes, but when I search for updates it says latest version is 10.6.3 - any suggestions?   <answer89547> You can try downloading v11 from Apple's website:  http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/  Hope that solves it!  <comment105133> Which version of OS X are you running? <comment105136> Are you sure you are running OS X 10.6.8 or later? According to http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ that's what you need to be able to run iTunes 11.
