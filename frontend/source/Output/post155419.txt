Adjust delay for activating Full Screen Mode toolbar <body> Is it possible to change the delay on the full screen mode window toolbar in OS X Yosemite?  I'm thinking of something like this, but for the toolbar  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 5 /code/pre  I love using full screen mode, but I'm frequently accidentally triggering the toolbar which covers up whatever I'm trying to access at the top of the screen.  <answer283877> Try     defaults write -g NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001   Or     defaults delete -g NSWindowResizeTime   to revert it.  Taken from http://www.defaults-write.com/disable-full-screen-animation-of-os-x/.  <comment195086> Also searching for this answer <comment314577> From my search on the `defaults domains`I've found nothing regarding the Menu/Tool bar. As explained here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/252515/79808 <comment359039> Doesn't seem to have any effect for me. Is there somer reset that needs to happen after the command? <comment359070> @JesseSchoff try $ killall Finder from the Terminal/command-line ..
