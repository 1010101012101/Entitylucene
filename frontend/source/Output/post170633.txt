Payments to App Store <body> Suppose I want to find (for tax purposes) the amounts of all payments I made to the App store during 2014.  In the App Store application, I did not find this information in "Purchases" nor in "View My Account".  Is there something easier than finding the dates of my purchases (under "Purchases"), then looking for that date in my credit card statements?  <answer170639> ol liOpen iTunes on your Mac or PC./li liClick iTunes Store./li liClick Sign In./li liEnter your Apple ID and password./li liClick your Apple ID and select Account Info from the drop-down menu./li liNext to Purchase History, click See All. ul liIt might take a moment for your Purchase History to appear./li /ul/li liTo see the details for a purchase, click the arrow to the left of the order date.

"Apps" shows me only iOS apps, but "Purchase History" shows those and OS X apps along with movies and music.
