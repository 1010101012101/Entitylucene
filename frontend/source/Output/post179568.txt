Sort and remove duplicate photos <body> I have been trying to collate all my photos &amp; remove the duplicated ones. I have purchased a few apps but none do the job properly, they are still there the next day, I have 3 hard drives so plenty of space. The pictures seem to get duplicated every time I try something. I have tried iPhoto but still get the same problem.  <answer179573> There are many options – and at least three different approaches to this:  ul liUse a third party application to find (and remove) duplicate files. Probably the most convenient option – there is a variety of different apps like Duplicate Detective available – but you'll have to buy a license. There used to be a free demo version of Gemini, if you just want to find duplicates and delete them yourself. Haven't tried it for years though. /li liUse the search function of your finder. This is a bit clumsy, but good method to find duplicates occasionally. You can search for "*" (asterix/wildcard) and then narrow your results down by using the filters and the sort options – e.g. "only images, modified after 1st of January 2014" or the like./li liUse Terminal Commands or Apple Script. You should probably only go this direction if you know what you're doing./li /ul  There is a blog post "How to Find and Delete Duplicate Files in Mac OS X" that goes deeper into these three approaches.   <comment212900> If the pictures seem to re-duplicate after you have deleted them, it might be better to turn off whatever is causing the duplication first. Please ask a new question if you need assistance in doing so. <comment212901> Regarding the removing of duplicates: how are your photos organized? Are you using some kind of folder structure, or iPhoto/other application? Do you take pictures with an iPhone and use iCloud syncing to get the onto your computer? <comment219308> Does Gemini work on Photos libraries as well as iPhoto libraries?
