How can I bookmark the left page of a PDF in Preview? <body> In Preview, Command-D will allow you to bookmark the current page of the PDF for later reference.  However, when viewing the PDF in two-up mode (Command-3), it will emalways/em bookmark the right-hand page.  How can I bookmark the left-hand page for those times when it's that page precisely that I want to bookmark?  <answer171357> I do not know how to do that with Bookmarks, but I use a work around till Apple does something.  Instead of bookmarks I use Highlights and Notes (alt+cmd+4)  Then I place a Note on appropriate page (left or right) or anywhere.  The advantage is I can make comments in the note.  Example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Qqrt.jpg" alt="notes"
