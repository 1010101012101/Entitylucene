How do I modify my iphone's backup? <body> I have an iPhone that has been restored to factory defaults. I added a contact to the phone and backed up it. I used a SQLite database editor to update the name of the contact but if I try to restore the backup to the phone iTunes , it says that the backup is corrupted.  How can I update my backup and restore it to my iPhone? Why is it not working?  <comment113897> Might help, don't think it's possible otherwise... http://www.icopybot.com/itunes-backup-manager.htm <comment113927> I really interested in how the iTunes determines the validity of the backup. I'm guessing it has a hash for the original backup and once its modified that check fails. Where is that hash stored? Hows is that hash generated?
