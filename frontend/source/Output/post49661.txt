How to fix the Cydia data problem? <body> My iPad 2 is jailbroken and running iOS 5.0.1. When I open up Cydia, it shows me a message : codeThe package com.teiron.pphelper needs to be reinstalled. But I can't find an archive for it./codebr How can I fix this problem?  <answer49687> This may work.  Install MobileTerminal and enter:  precodesu (and enter password, alpine by default)  dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq com.teiron.pphelper  dpkg --configure -a /code/pre  If this doesn't work, let me know, and I'll look for something else... Hope this helps!  <answer95297> It's easyer to find right repo for com.teiron.pphelper, add it to cydia and than will everything be ok again.  <comment56881> This should work. <comment56933> Do you mean to find a app whose name is Mobile Terminal and enther the command ? <comment57122> @LeonPak Yes, that's what he means.
