I'd like to know how to send a message correctly! <body> I sent my friend a message 10days ago but she didn't reply me yet. I use "Messages" / iPhone. We live in Canada. I noticed that I hadn't added “+1” on her number (XXX-XXX-XXXX) when I sent. Is it necessary to add +1 when l send text message to her? Or she's received it but she doesn't want to reply to me? I'd rather not send a message again if so.  Can you send a text to someone without +1 (just his/her number)? We have Canada numbers. Thanks!  <comment340680> text [SMS] or iMessage? Green or Blue? text has no read receipt so you can only tell if it's delivered if it went in blue. You can only tell it's been read if the receiver has 'read receipts' switched on. afaik, the phone should add the country code if it's needed. <comment340845> Thank you for replying me. I sent a text message(green). I think l was succeeded in sending it because l didn't receive an error message. I tried to send a message to myself without +1. And after I could receive it...
