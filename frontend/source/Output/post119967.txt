How can I create 'gch.app' such that "open -a gch page.html" works like "open -a Google\ Chrome page.html"? <body> I type codeopen -a/code all the time from the terminal, and more often than not the application I want is codeGoogle Chrome.app/code, so I end up entering things along the lines of:  precodeopen -a Google\ Chrome some_file.html /code/pre  I'd like to create a symlink/shortcut to code/Applications/Google Chrome.app/code named codegch.app/code or what have you, so I can codeopen -a gch foo.html/code which is slightly quicker.  Admittedly it'd take months+ to recoup the amount of time it's taken me to ask this question...  I know I could create zsh aliases and/or bash functions for this kind of thing but I'm relatively new to OSX and want to learn.  My first intuition was to try things along the lines of:  precodeln -s /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app /Applications/gch.app /code/pre  but no dice were had.  <answer119968> The application name is defined by the application itself, there is no easy way to use a different one for codeopen/code. So in this case using an alias is probably the best option  precodealias gch='open -a Google\ Chrome' /code/pre  Alternatively you could define Chrome as the default application for html files and just use codeopen some_file.html/code.  <comment139946> Do you want to put it in the dock? I'm searching for something like this, too.
