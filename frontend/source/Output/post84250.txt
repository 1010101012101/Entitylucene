Installing RPM with MacPorts on Mac OS X 10.7.5 <body> I installed MacPorts from the official site usting .pkg installer for Mac, accepting all default installation settings.  Then my goal was to install rpm, so I typed respectively :  precodesudo port -v selfupdate /code/pre  Port installed all updates and then:  precodesudo port install rpm /code/pre  Port computed and downloaded all dependencies for rpm. The final information about rpm installtion stated :  precode---&gt;  Installing rpm @4.4.9_14 ---&gt;  Activating rpm @4.4.9_14 ---&gt;  Cleaning rpm ---&gt;  Updating database of binaries: 100.0% ---&gt;  Scanning binaries for linking errors: 100.0% ---&gt;  No broken files found. /code/pre  It seems that it has been installed succesfully.  precodes239:~ Jakub$ which rpm /opt/local/bin/rpm s239:~ Jakub $ rpm -ql python Segmentation fault: 11 /code/pre  Does anyone have an idea what is wrong here and how to solve this?  I am on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5, downloaded MacPorts for Lion, not Mountain Lion.  I can provide more information about my system if it is needed to solve this.  <comment96927> There are two questions asked here: 1) What happened to the command line prompt? 2) How do you solve the segmentation fault. Really you should only be asking one question at a time. So, which question do you want answered? <comment96946> Welcome to Ask Different! You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your first question, you should be able to find the answer on this site already. Otherwise feel free to ask a new question. <comment96949> Sorry didn't think about that when I was writting this post. I've already found an answer for the second question after I separated that problem from the problem of RPM - you were right guys - single question per post, and thanks for editting for me! So now I am looking foward to see answer for the problem with RPM, which still doesn't work.
