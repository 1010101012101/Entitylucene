rMBP 2015: Force Click is not working for look up and data detectors <body> I have a similar issue documented in "Force Click Not Working on Macbook" but none of the resolutions mentioned in the discussion solves my case.  Here are my findings so far:  1) It only worked on the first day  2) I have "Force click with one finger" set for "Look up &amp; data detectors". It still doesn't work. I switched to "Tap with three fingers" and the look up works fine.   3) I tried Force Click on other functions (eg: calendar, quicktime, dock, etc) all are working fine. This indicates that hardware is good.  4) I upgraded OS X to 10.10.3 and it does not work still.  I am totally stuck now and appreciate for any suggestion on what might have gone wrong. Thanks!
