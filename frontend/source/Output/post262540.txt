Can't restore or update IPhone - TATSU declined to authorize <body> I'm attempting to either restore or update an iPhone 5 which won't boot. It's stuck on the apple logo boot screen. Hard reset does nothing.  I have tried normal restore mode via iTunes and DFU mode.   I'm signed into iTunes as the same apple ID as the phone.  I've authorized the mac for this apple ID in iTunes.  each time I try and either do update or restore I get the following error from iTunes:  iphone could not be restored (updated). TATSU declined to authorize this image on this device for this user.  Anything else I can try? it does not matter if I lose the data on the phone. Just needs to work again.  Also is there a way to view the boot sequence from my mac or the phone either via terminal or xcode or something so I can see where it's hanging in the boot sequence?  <answer262549> for anyone else who comes across this or something similar. It turned out that my stronghosts file had an entry to gs.apple.com/strong which was causing apple's signing (TATSU) server request to fail with their not so helpful error message.   So you need to check your hosts file on the computer you are running iTunes on to see if there are any entries to stronggs.apple.com/strong and then either remove those lines or comment them out by placing a strong#/strong at the start of the line.   like so strong#gs.apple.com 74.454.656.343/strong  easiest way is via terminal. look up how to edit host file if you don't know how. on my mac the host file was located at strong/etc/hosts/strong  once in terminal: strongsudo nano /etc/hosts/strong will open an editor, once changed strongcontrol x/strong will exit, type y then enter when prompted to save your changes to the hosts file. all done.  <answer267656>    Mac      If you're using a Mac, follow these steps:      ol   liIn the Finder, choose Applications  Utilities./li   liOpen Terminal./li   liType this command and press Return:/li   /ol      sudo nano /private/etc/hosts      ol start="4"   liEnter the password you use to sign in to your computer and press Return.

Close the Terminal and move on to the next section of this article, "Address TCP/IP filtering, firewall, or security software."      ol start="7"   liAdd the # symbol and a space ("# ") to the beginning of the gs.apple.com entry./li   liPress Control-O to save the file./li   liPress Return when asked for the filename./li   liPress Control-X to exit the editor./li   liRestart your Mac./li   /ol      After your computer is finished restarting, try to update or restore your iOS device again.   https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201442  That being said, there is no such entry in my /private/etc/hosts or in my /etc/hosts file, so I will look for other solutions to this error.   <comment332763> I checked my hosts file and does not have gs.apple.com entry... Is there any other ways to solve this? <comment334006> check what the exact error code is you are getting back from TATSU
