Connection timeout when sharing internet with password <body> I have a MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion 10.8. I am connecting to the Internet via a USB Internet Key. I enabled internet sharing via WiFi.  My friend has a MacBook Pro with Lion 10.7.  When I enable WPA2 Personal with a password, he gets "connection timeout" when clicking on my network name (even before entering the passcode). When I select "none" for security (no passcode), he has no issues connecting.  By request, I've added a screenshot showing that my only options are WPA2 or 'None': img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fQ1HO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer59515> When you use Internet Sharing over Wi-Fi, you create an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network. Ad-hoc Wi-Fi only supports WEP for encryption on Lion and earlier. You can’t use WPA2 to encrypt an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network unless you are running Mountain Lion.  Edit: I see that you are using channel 36, that means 5GHz Wi-Fi. Try switching to a 2.4GHz channel (1-11, where I live).   <answer59994> Change security from 40 to 128-bit.  <answer72570> To try to make things clear let's say you have 2 Mac named:  ul liAlex/li liBob/li /ul  Here is the scheme of your small home network :  precodeInternet --- USB --- Alex --- WLAN --- Bob /code/pre  If when Bob try to join the wireless network (AirPort or WI-Fi or better WLAN) initiated from Alex, it gets an immediate rejection, this may be due to a network access with the wrong security setting.  To check this hypothesis, on Bob, simply go within:  precodeSystem Preferences… &gt; Network &gt; WiFi &gt; Advanced… /code/pre  and look at the column Security.  If it is anything else than codeWPA2 Personal/code, double click on this network setting to fix it.  If it is already codeWPA2 Personal/code, double click on this network setting to check if the registered password is OK.  <comment68549> Yet, when creating my ad-hoc network the only options were "none" or "wpa2 personal" <comment68550> That’s very unusual… Can I get a screenshot of the screen where you configure the network with the security menu open? <comment68562> see updated question <comment69064> where do you see 40 or 128?? <comment69723> changing the channel didn't help <comment70674> Note that a iPhone was able to connect to my network without problems. <comment71719> Checkout: http://tidbits.com/article/13158 for details on how Mountain Lion changed internet sharing and issues with using WEP.  It indicates, WEP will be allowed if you hold down the option key. <comment73689> Which version of Lion is running your friend's MacBook Pro? <comment84265> Of course, since as you indicated it, your network was working on this channel 36, but with security off. <comment88663> This setting was relevant with WEP. <comment88664> I wouldn't advise any return to WEP. WEP is simply **false security**! <comment88689> As very well explained here: http://tidbits.com/article/13158, an `ad-hoc` Wi-Fi network and `InternetSharing` are 2 different ways to build a wireless network. The `ad-hoc` one shouldn't be used anymore because it does only provide WEP which is just **false security**. <comment88724> I am sorry. I did not know Mountain Lion used WPA2 since I stopped using Internet Sharing after Lion.
