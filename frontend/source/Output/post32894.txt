How to disable Preview from opening up the last couple items viewed? osx lion <body> When I download a PDF and open it in Preview on OS X Lion, Preview opens the last couple documents that I viewed. It seems to arbitrarily open anywhere from the last document to the last x documents.    Does anyone know how to disable this feature?  <answer32896> To stop emonly/em Preview from doing this open up Terminal.app and enter:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false /code/pre  To re-enable this at any time enter:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool true /code/pre  If you want to turn off the resume-on-load feature for emall/em applications you can go to System Preferences - General and at the bottom of the screen uncheck the option codeRestore windows when quitting and re-opening apps/code to prevent any application from doing this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZLT2.png" alt="Turn off application restore features for all applications"  <comment37615> A similar and detailed answer is at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32429/lions-preview-regularly-hangs-when-unhiding-with-open-documents/32872#32872 <comment39180> Nice i have the same question too. Opened last page is good feature, but opened last document is annoying.
