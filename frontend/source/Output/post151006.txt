Can you add a 3rd-party hybrid disk to a 2012 Mac Mini? <body> The Apple Fusion drive is done predominantly through clever software, I wondered what happens if instead of trying to do a DIY Fusion with 2 drives, you just replace the standard fixed drive with a hybrid drive.  e.g. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-Serial-Solid-State-Hybrid/dp/B00FQH7MQ2  Is OSX compatible with this, would it still work with BootCamp, etc?  <comment177668> Well, a mini can't take a 3.5" drive anyway, so that one's off the table for starters. Have a look at http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/mac-mini-aluminum-unibody-faq/how-to-upgrade-hard-drive-aluminum-unibody-mac-mini.html I'm not setting this as an answer, because tbh, I don't know if that drive would work, even if 2.5". Presumably, so long as you format it as Core Storage, it would be fine, though. <comment177669> Sorry that was just the first one I found, in case people weren't fully aware what I meant by hybrid :) But thanks for pointing it out. <comment177758> Theoretically, the answer to your question is "Yes". You just have to find one that will squeeze in the slot ;-)
