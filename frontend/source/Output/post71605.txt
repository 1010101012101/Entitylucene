My New Internal HD is mounted as /Volumes/hdd <body> I replaced my optical disk with an SSD for startup and Mountain Lion and upgraded my HDD to a larger one.  I also moved my home folder to the new disk.  But one thing is still bugging me.  My mid-2010 MBP automatically mounts the new drive as /Volumes/hdd.  Do I need /Volumes in there?  Do I have to do a symlink?  Maybe this is weird, but I'd like the new drive to behave like the startup drive but not actually embe/em the start up drive.  <comment83610> So your home folder is now inside `/Volumes/hdd`, but you would like it located as usual in `/Users/your username`, is that right? Do you have any other data on your new HDD? Can you please open Terminal (ApplicationsUtilities), type `df` and add it to your question?
