Connect iPhone to Internet through laptop? <body> I have a laptop at work that's connected to the the office LAN.  I have an iPhone that sometimes can sort of connect via Sprint, but usually it's pretty slow.  However, when I'm at the office, my iPhone/Sprint can barely connect at all. It's hopeless.  Is there some way my laptop can create a WiFi network that my iPhone can use and thereby share my laptop's fast connection?  I've tried going to "Create network" on my laptop, then "Create computer-to-computer network" and then on my iPhone going to Settings  WiFi  Choose a Network and actually connecting to that WiFi network I just created.  Once I do that, I can look in the iPhone's settings and verify that the phone is supposedly on that WiFi network and it has an I.P. address.  However, in the upper-left area of my iPhone screen it still says, "Sprint" and there's a little circle after it. (Circle???)  In terms of functionality, the phone is still ridiculously slow as if it were still trying to use the more-or-less useless Sprint service.  So is there some better way to do this that allows my iPhone to get a fast connection?  <answer39197> Sounds like Internet Sharing is what you want (go to System Preferences  Sharing). This post and video shows you how to switch it on, although I've not actually tried it myself.  IIRC, the "circle" icon means you have a GPRS connection, not the faster EDGE or 3G connections.
