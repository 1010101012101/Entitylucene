How to jailbreak my iPhone 5c with iOS 8.3? <body> I have an iPhone 5c with iOS 8.3 and I have been wanting to jailbreak my phone for a long time but I don't know how. I want to do this because I want to get unlimited gems for free on Clash of Clans and so I could get other free stuff on my phone.  <answer187136> At the time of writing, there is no public jailbreak for iOS 8.3.  <comment221149> Then do you know of any way that I mod my Clash of Clans game or any way that I can get free gem on Clash of Clans.
