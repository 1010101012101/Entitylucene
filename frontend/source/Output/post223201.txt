How to install uBlock Origin for Safari? <body> Is there any way to install uBlock Origin on Safari?  I'm currently using macOS 10.11.2 with Safari 9.0.2 on a 2012 MacBook Pro.  <answer225906> Nope, but you can install uBlock. Unfortunately, it seems like its development has stalled recently, but it still works for the most part.  <answer264887> Now there is, thanks to a new fork of uBlock Origin for Safari by el1t. As of writing, as it's still in alpha, you will need to download the extension from GitHub and then install it by clicking on the downloaded file.
