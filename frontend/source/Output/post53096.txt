Is it possible to install Linux packages on OS X? <body> I know that the Mac commandline is very similar to that of Linux operating systems, so it would be nice to use some features of Linux in my Mac, specially installing Linux packages. For example, in Linux we can install a package by simply typing codesudo apt-get install "package name"/code at the prompt. Is it possible to do something like this on Mac?  <answer53098> Yes, it is possible to install and run a variety of UNIX applications on OS X. There are a few solutions out there, my choice and recommendation is Homebrew. I've found other solutions to be overly complex and unwieldy.  <answer53109> Did you take a look at MacPorts?  <comment60693> in linux terminal installing command does any thing automatically it downloads files and ... how about Homebrew? is it required to download files manually? <comment60710> I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. <comment60716> @peaceman once you've [set up Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation), it downloads all the dependencies and files you need for any package you install from its repository. It's a beautiful thing, really. <comment60728> How is MacPorts (to pick one) "overly complex and unwieldy"? I installed it and I call `sudo port install "name"` to install something. How is Homebrew easier than that? <comment60777> @CajunLuke for one MacPorts will install duplicates of everything it needs. Don't want another bzip2? Too bad, you're getting one. Brew on the other hand leverages the existing system. I have 23 packages I like to install. With Macports that balloons with dependancies to 144 packages. With Homebrew, only 44. That's what I call "overly complex". You should seriously try Homebrew. You'll like it better. <comment60779> @bahamat Seeing as I didn't notice the extra packages being installed, I probably wouldn't notice any benefit. I mostly use MacPorts for screwing around (case in point: the last time I touched any MacPorts stuff was to install wine so I could see how well [or how poorly] iTunes for Windows ran on the Mac). <comment60781> Like I said, you should seriously try it. It's easier to manage, it's easier to use, it's easier to fix and it's easier to contribute. I'm not trying to win. Just see for yourself, then pick the one you prefer.
