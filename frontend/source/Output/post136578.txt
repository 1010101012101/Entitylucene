Can Apple Macs bind to two domains in two separate forests? <body> Is there anyway natively or with third party extension to bind a Mac so that it can search two domains for Authentication?  We have two forests each with one domain in them. In Active Directory terms there is a trust relationship between them so users can log in to Windows workstations with credentials from either domain. As we try to move to a single Domain in a single forest I need to understand if the Mac's can at least temporarily support Authentication against both domains...  After sorting that I can see how it handles the same username, Active Directory ID (SID) etc...  <answer136669> strongIn OS X Mavericks/strong  The same as binding the Mac to the Active Directory to the Domain for the first time - System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Options. Unlock the advanced options and click Edit.  Here you can click the plus and add the additional domains' details  Some points to consider:  ul liThe Mac will need a computer account in the additional domain/li liUsers who login where a user with the same samAccountName will be prompted for Admin credentials in order to rebuild the Library. This only happens when a matching user has already logged in to the Mac/li liUsers will be prompted for the 'matching' user's password as OS X seems to try and migrate the users 'keychain'/li liConsideration should be given as to the order with which domains should be checked for authentication requests/li /ul  I've still yet to dig into policies and configuration across the domains and how they affect the Macs' being in both domains.... though I still haven't learnt how that works so it may be a non issue
