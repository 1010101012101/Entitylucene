Shell Script for Yesterday's Date <body> I'm trying to execute the following shellscript with hazel app on any file in the folder.  It works, but the only thing thats causing a problem is the date for yesterday.  precode#! /bin/bash  saveDir="TJ" dd=$(date --date='yesterday' +'%m-%d-%Y') for file in *.csv ; do     saveName="${saveDir}/TJ ${dd}.csv"     cut -d',' -f2,14 "$file" &gt; "$saveName" done /code/pre  Any ideas why it isn't working?  <answer115835> The date utility bundled with OS X is not GNU date (which accepts the code--date/code option).   You can use homebrew to install it.  You can probably use Perl to get what you want:  precodeperl -MPOSIX=strftime -le 'print strftime("%d-%m-%Y",localtime(time()-86400))' # or perl -MTime::Piece -MTime::Seconds -le 'print((Time::Piece-&gt;new - ONE_DAY)-&gt;dmy)' /code/pre  <answer115836> Try using date like this:  precodedd=$(date -v -1d '+%m-%d-%y') /code/pre  as mentioned codeyesterday/code is part of GNU Date, but using an offset of -1d should be equivalent for OS X use.
