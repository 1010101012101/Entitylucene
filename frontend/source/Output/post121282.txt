Special character codes are displayed in the Terminal for diacritics when connecting to an Ubuntu Server <body> When I connect to an Ubuntu Server (ssh) and I try to see some text in the Terminal form the remote server, I get character codes instead of the appropriate text with diacritics.  for example for a codegit log/code on the server I get:    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeAuthor: Ionic&lt;C4&gt;&lt;83&gt; Biz&lt;C4&gt;&lt;83&gt;u &lt;bizauionica@...&gt; /code/pre  instead of:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeAuthor: Ionică Bizău &lt;bizauionica@...&gt; /code/pre  When I do codegit log/code on my local machine in the Terminal, I get the correct diacritics.  I have no idea in which category this issue falls:  ul liTerminal/li libash/li lissh/li liUbuntu/li ligit/li /ul  I initially asked Ubuntu for this issue but they redirected me here.  Any ideas?  <answer121558> The codeLC_ALL/code variable having an empty value was causing the problem.  So the solution of this problem can be found on SO here:  On mac, the codeLC_ALL/code variable is not set by default. So writing:  precodeexport LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8   /code/pre  in your code~/.bash_profile/code fixes the problem. I assume that You have a default SSH config that has codeLC_*/code in the codeSendEnv/code configuration.  <comment141359> Terminal is showing the UTF-8 bytes in hex for the non-ascii character, probably some preference setting needs adjustment. <comment141492> What does `locale` print on the server, or have you tried running `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`? <comment141552> On the Ubuntu server (seen through SSH): ` LANG=en_US.UTF-8  LANGUAGE=  LC_CTYPE=UTF-8  LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"  LC_ALL=  ` <comment141553> And on my Mac: ` LANG=  LC_COLLATE="C"  LC_CTYPE="UTF-8"  LC_MESSAGES="C"  LC_MONETARY="C"  LC_NUMERIC="C"  LC_TIME="C"  LC_ALL=  `
