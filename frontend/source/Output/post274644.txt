Can I Airplay from one mac to another? (or from iOS to Mac) <body> I have a Mac connected to a large 27 inch monitor. I want to be able to remotely push audio and video to it. The source device can be an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac.  (Imagine a dorm room situation, where I want to play Netflix, or other media on the big screen, from my phone, and use that phone as a remote)  As a developer, I've come across some bugs in the past that make it appear that an OSX could act as an Airplay emTarget/em.   Is there any way I can make this happen?  <answer274645> You can AirPlay from your iOS device to your Mac using Reflector 2. This works on macOS Sierra.
