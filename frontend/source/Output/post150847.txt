Unable to upgrade from OS X Mavericks to OS X Yosemite <body> I have a problem upgrading the system from os x mavericks to os x yosemite. I tried to update it through the app store, but it says that it is unavailable in the UK? Can anyone explain to me what this means?   <answer150848> It means it isn't available in your region yet. You just need to give it a bit of time.  <comment177544> it is not yet available - be patience. <comment177546> @ReneLarsen "be patience" - I agree ;) <comment177573> It is now available in the Store <comment177579> It's not available in the U.S. Region either apparently. I get that error message in the US. That their servers are overloaded and throwing bad back bad error messages. I hope it's the latter as not having it available int he US is bad.
