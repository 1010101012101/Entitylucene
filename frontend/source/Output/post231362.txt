What is the root username and password for CUPS 2.1.0 <body> I don't remember creating one and I'm just trying to print in black and white.   <answer231364> Normally you don't need to enter a root username and password to use CUPS. The error is likely to be in /etc/cups/printers.conf You could check the authorization entries in your printers.conf  Even simpler though is that CUPS.org recommends just using your normal admin username and password when asked for authorization:     Use the username and password for your computer.   You will need an account with admin privileges: most OS X computer owners have such an account, it's usually only in an lab or a company where you wouldn't have admin privileges.  I hope this works in your case, Esmeralda. If it doesn't please post some follow up information, such as your printers.conf file.  <comment282564> Where do you need to enter username/password? Is there a dialog box of some kind? <comment363695> Please consider selecting the below as a valid answer, it worked for me, I assume it did for you too? <comment363696> @patrix: if you click on adming (localhost:631) it will provide a dialog box.
