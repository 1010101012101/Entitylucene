Trigger function key using AppleScript <body> I'm trying to trigger a function key using applescript. I need it to press the 'volume up' key with fn.  I wrote the following AppleScript but it isn't effective:  precodetell application "System Events"     key down 63 -- fn     key code 111 -- f12     key up 63 end tell /code/pre  just executing codekey code 111/code gives me the same result as the code above,   precode key down 63  /code/pre  doesn't seem to effect the behaviour of the script, the f12 key is being pressed, without the function modifier.  Is there anything like   precode using function down / using fn down /code/pre  just like there is for the command key  precode using command down /code/pre  or is there any other way to achieve this?  <answer164196> if you are trying to set the volume in AppleScript a correct syntax would be as the following, no need to force button presses :  precodetell application "System Events" set volume 4 end tell /code/pre  Now as you can see its a forced process. If you want more flexibility like determining where the users volume is currently at or set it to increment increase/decrease by 1, yes it's possible, but a little more code heavy than i can manage right now (i'm typing from my iPhone)   However,   If at possible, and your end goal wouldn't be affected by using Automator. I would use Automator if I was you, it has built in functions like this with easy drag and drop motives. 'Set Computer Volume is one of them'. But thats an alternative, I just emulated that with the code above.   <comment192398> The volume up/down keys are not accessible as 'keys' from applescript. See this for a way to achieve system volume control by Applescript - http://superuser.com/questions/224264/how-do-i-control-the-system-volume-on-os-x-with-a-keyboard-without-media-control <comment192399> @Tetsujin Hey, thanks for your reply. Is there really no way to trigger them as keys being pressed? It's not just the volume key I want to trigger. I want to trigger the pause key in the OS determined context (could pause VLC, iTunes etc.). <comment192401> You can call 'true' F-Keys, but not their 'extra function' alternatives. keystroke "F12" will press F12 but not Fn/F12 [doesn't matter which way you have your system prefs set, it will send *just* F12, not volume up.] <comment192404> Alright thanks, is there any way to trigger the actions bound to the extra function keys? What does fn+f12 execute? Can I call this manually? <comment192417> This is actually becoming an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info) What you are looking for is a way to control specific functions, volume, pause etc, not the key-presses required to trigger those functions - there are examples for iTunes on the link I posted. I'm not sure VLC can be controlled like iTunes when it is not the frontmost app, so the solutions may differ. <comment192437> @Tetsujin, seemingly so, but I want to execute the action assigned to this (extra) function key as this is context specific, it does different stuff for different contexts (applications) <comment192450> yet the 'volume up' command is in no way context-sensitive. <comment192451> @Tetsujin "It's not just the volume key I want to trigger. I want to trigger the pause key in the OS determined context (could pause VLC, iTunes etc.)." <comment192454> The media keys are not context-sensitive. iTunes is controllable at very low level, as it's tightly integrated to the OS. VLC isn't, as it isn't. Doug Adams is the guy for controlling iTunes - http://dougscripts.com/itunes/ <comment192455> VLC pauses/resumes media playback on press of the play/pause function key though. Thanks for your help!
