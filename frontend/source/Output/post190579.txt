Password reset issue using terminal method <body> No user accounts are displayed in the window that pops up after I enter the 'resetpassword' command into the terminal.   Is there another way to reset my admin password or fix this issue?  <answer190988> A wire connecting the hard drive was loose.   <comment226288> Are you booted into "Recovery Mode" to use the command resetpassword? <comment226291> Yes, that's it. I've also tried cmd + S to go straight into the terminal on start up but that's not working either. <comment226294> Does your harddisk show up in the pop up box and is it selected?  Something like "Macintosh HD". <comment226295> No, it's completely blank <comment226296> Hmm, can you boot into your computer normally and get to the login screen?  Sounds like you have more of an issue with the hard drive not a password. <comment226297> I can get into the guest account at the moment, but yes I have been having issues. <comment226298> I would try running Disk Repair from Disk Utility in Recovery mode and see if that clears a little bit up for the resetpassword dialog. <comment226299> I have done that a few times now but still no luck. Weirdly it keeps saying it's okay on the repair logs.
