Weather Problems in Notification Center <body> Whenever I open my notification center to check the weather all the locations I have set up all show the same result as my current locations weather (see screenshot below). For example Houston, TX shows the exact same weather as it does in my location Glendale, CA.   Anyone got a clue why this is happening?
