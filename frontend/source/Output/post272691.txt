Can I merge Messages on my Mac? <body> I had previously asked this as part of another question, but I realized it would be better if I kept them separate:  I have newer messages on one hard drive, and older messages on a Time Machine backup. How can I merge them?  <comment342726> Please specify your version of macOS and if you are referring to iMessages.app <comment342728> @n1000 Sierra 10.12.4 Beta, and yes, it is Messages.app
