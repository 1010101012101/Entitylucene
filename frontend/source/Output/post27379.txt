Why is the text-to-speech hotkey not working? <body> For some reason, my text to speech isn't working. I don't know why it stopped working. It works when I manually click it, but when using the default hotkey kbdalt/kbd+kbdesc/kbd, it doesn't do anything.  I have no idea what happened. How can I fix this? I tried changing hotkeys, but the problem persists.  <answer62728> Sometimes you just need to reboot your machine. Mine sometimes just stops working. A reboot takes care of it.  <answer78835> I had a problem using speech with the Preview app. Turns out something went screwy after adding annotations to the specific document I was looking at and all I had to do was revert it.  <answer80878> I have also experience this problem.  I have found today that shutting Google Chrome and restarting it cures the problem.  Update. This happened again &amp; restarting google chrome did not fix it. I ended up closing all my open programs &amp; finder windows &amp; restarting finder then it worked again.  I will update this again next time it fails &amp; try to identify the specific action that fixes it or causes it.   I have a hunch it may be connected with System Preferences, finder windows or Monitor.  <answer275012> I found that these steps worked for me and prevented a reboot.  ol liGo into System Preferences and open Sound/li liSelect the Output tab./li liSwitch to a different output than you are currently using./li liSwitch back to Internal Speakers, Headphones, or whatever you typically use./li liReturn to Accessibility, Speech and test using the Play button./li /ol  These steps worked for me and I'm assuming it might have to do with an application I have installed called Loopback that allows me to record internal audio.  Hope this helps someone else out there that might be experiencing the same issue.  <answer283270> Thanks geekinit! I used your idea but in less steps.  ol liHold option and click the speaker(sound/Volume) icon on the top menu bar/li liChange to different output device/li liUse same technique to switch back to internal speakers or headphones (etc...) /li /ol  This fixed the problem for me without having to go into system preferences.  <comment51544> I have the same issue constantly, and have to restart the computer each time to get it working again. <comment83749> Try running Disk verify/repair. Sounds weird I know but that is what just fixed my issue. If verify doesn't tell you something is wrong then don't worry about the repair.
