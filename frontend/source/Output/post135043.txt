Is it possible to make a web clipped widget smaller? <body> I am trying to make a "web clip" widget for my dashboard of the Stack Exchange top bar (to keep an eye on moderator flags, etc).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bOuX2.png" alt="Widget"  The problem is that it won't let me make the widget smaller than 110 pixels when clipping it in Safari.  Is there any known work-around for this?
