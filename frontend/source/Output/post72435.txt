Using Ram pulled from new iMac in an old iMac? <body> My parents have an iMac circa 2007. Documentation says that this model should use this type of RAM:  Memory: DDR2 PC2-5300 Memory Type: DDR2 PC2-5300, DDR2 (non-ECC) Maximum Memory: 4GB   I've got a couple of 2GB RAM chips lying around that I just pulled from my "new" iMac. The info on the chips reads:  2GB 1Rx8 PC3  Will these work in my parent's iMac, or am I just asking for trouble?  Thanks!  <answer72437> No.  Those new iMacs are using DDR3, and it won't even fit.  DDR2 are pretty cheap right now, you can get some off the Internet.  <comment84140> You can read more about DDR2/3 on Wikipedia! <comment84144> And [Other World Computing](http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/apple/memory/iMac/Intel_Core_2_Duo) has your back for legacy upgrades. <comment84146> [Apple's support knowledge base](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1423?viewlocale=en_US) is probably the most definitive source for answers for this question.
