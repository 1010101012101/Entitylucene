How to write the names "iPhone", "iPad", etc. in all capital letters? <body> Just curious about whether it is iPHONE, IPHONE, or just never written in all capital letters. Is there a style guide or something on this issue?  <answer15026> The only official name is "iPhone". If you are putting it in capitals, it is just a matter of choice whether the initial codei/code is uppercase or lowercase. Personally, I think it looks better as "iPHONE".  <answer15027> There is an Apple Publications Style Guide, and it says to not use all caps for emphasis. (Apple Style Guide, PDF)  I can't recall ever seeing all-capital letters in an Apple publication. In the design world, all-capital letters are generally considered hard to read and, in most fonts, ugly, so it's my guess that Apple would avoid the use of all-caps.   <answer15032> As initially mentioned by Neil, the emApple Publications Style Guide/em is the place to look.  From page 34:     ul   liemWhat to capitalize:/em Follow these rules when you use title-style capitalization.br   Capitalize every word except:br   ul   liArticles (ema, an, the/em), unless an article is the first word or follows a colon/li   liCoordinating conjunctions (emand, but, or, nor, for, yet/em, and emso/em)/li   liThe word emto/em in infinitives (emHow to Start Your Printer/em)/li   liThe word emas/em, regardless of the part of speech/li   listrongWords that always begin with a lowercase letter, such as emiPod/em and emiTunes/em/strong/li   liPrepositions of four letters or fewer (emat, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, onto, out, over, to, up/em, and emwith/em), except when the word is part of a verb phrase or is used as another part of speech (such as an adverb, adjective, noun, or verb).brbr   Starting Up the Computerbr   Logging In to the Serverbr   Getting Started with Your MacBook Pro/li   /ul/li   /ul   That is, the emi/em in words like iPod and iTunes (and iMac, iPhone, iPad, etc.) are never capitalized.  I don't believe that, given a choice, Apple ever uses all caps, although the only specific rule I've found is on page 33:     Donâ€™t use all caps for emphasis.   <comment16284> I actually have an interesting example. Take a look at the bottom left hand side of http://www.apple.com/ipod/, and see also http://www.apple.com/ipod/red/. It's their only product name that is pure caps. <comment16301> damn, page 33! did you read the other 32 pages?! <comment16306> @Cawas - It's 224 pages in total; while I haven't read *all* of them, I do refer to the *Guide* enough that I keep a local copy around for quick searching. <comment16307> @VxJason - that's because Apple didn't name it; they're just licensees. Wikipedia has a good article about the [(PRODUCT)RED brand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Red) if you want to know more. <comment16308> Heh. Only on a Mac site would people be concerned with stuff like this... how awesome. :) <comment16362> I suppose it is ultimately a matter of choice, but since Apple gives you guidance on this sort of thing as noted above, it would seem strange not to follow it.
