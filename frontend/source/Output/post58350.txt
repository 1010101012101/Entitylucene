How do I transfer my RSS feeds from Safari, now that it no longer supports RSS? <body> I have hundreds of RSS feeds saved as bookmarks in Safari, but the latest version (6.0) has disabled RSS feeds, and suggests getting a dedicated RSS reader from the App Store:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5jZUM.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a simple general procedure for transferring all of my saved RSS feeds from Safari to a new reader?  <answer58447> After installing an RSS reader, any attempt to open one of your existing feeds in Safari should open the RSS reader. For most readers, (e.g. Reeder) this will cause the app to ask if you want to subscribe to the just-opened feed. Once you've done that for a feed, you can delete it from Safari.   <comment67080> It appears that this question [may boil down](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/10532/4395) to finding a way to transfer feeds from Safari to Google Reader. <comment67081> Do you also need archived *content* to be transfered? (I do, but from Mail.app, for which the archives are still in `~/Library/Mail/RSS`, but that's a different question.) <comment67082> @Arjan: No such folder for me, so I guess not. <comment67084> Well, the folder was for RSS in Mail. But I assume that does not change your requirements. <comment67217> If you're Google searching, you want something that can export to OPML.
