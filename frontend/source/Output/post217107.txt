Why doesn't crontab run if screensaver is on? <body> I want to run a Crontab on OS X 10.11.1 (El Capitan).  I'm running the command:  precodeenv EDITOR=nano crontab -e /code/pre  to enter the crontab with nano as the editor.  Then I create my cronjob that looks like this:  precode50 */15 * * * touch /home/test.txt /code/pre  If I go to code/home//code there is nothing:  precodeUser 15:50:home $ ls -la total 2 dr-xr-xr-x   2 root  wheel     1 25 Nov 14:53 . drwxr-xr-x  31 root  wheel  1122 29 Okt 10:02 .. /code/pre  Why doesn't the cronjob run if the screensavers is on and screen is locked?  <answer217116> code/home/code is used by the automounter and can't be written to. Just try with another directory (eg code/tmp/code).   <comment262469> Do you have permission to  touch in /home (which is a non standard (OS X  place) do ls -la in the directory above Is */15 the correct syntax. Is touch on the path (and which path cron uses a different one). The normal way for OS X is use launchd - and use a tool like Launch Control <comment262474> Sry i don't get your comment
