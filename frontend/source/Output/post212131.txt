Install Boot Camp 6 Without Internet Connection <body> I'm using an early 2015 MacBook Pro and just updated it to El Capitan. Right now I want to install Windows 10 on my MBPr using Boot Camp. But the problem is, if I don't connect to the internet, Boot Camp Assistant will fail to install saying that it can't download additional software. I already downloaded the Boot Camp Support Software before so I don't want to waste a time to redownload it again.  Is there any solution for Boot Camp 6 to keep installing Windows without internet connection?  <answer255102> You will have to manually do it without using Boot Camp Assistant. This is the best guide I have found. You will have to create the partition then manually install the drivers once Windows is installed.
