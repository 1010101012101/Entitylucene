iphone 4 verizon cdma unlocked in india and uprgaded to newer version cydia not installed <body> I have an iPhone 4 (CDMA), bought it to India and unlocked unofficially by jailbreaking.  Recently I upgraded to iOS 6.1.2, and now Cydia is missing. Everything else is working fine; I can make calls, use internet and Wi-Fi, however is gone from my phone.  How can I install Cydia again? I am afraid of Jailbreaking my iPhone again in case it will lock the phone again. Is there a method of installing Cydia back without reverting the unlock?  <comment108928> It's not clear what you're asking here.

How did you upgrade? Through iTunes, or Over The Air (iPhone Settings  General  Software Update)?
