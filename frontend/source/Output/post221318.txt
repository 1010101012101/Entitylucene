How do I get macbook recovered from internet connectivity issue? <body> I'm very much worried due to annoying internet problem that I'm facing for the past few days. Please help me get out of this please suggest authentic solution, please.     Macbook Model = Late 2013. OSX version = El Capitan. Internet source =   Wi-Fi.   My macbook was working well and fast until it got infected by virus (may be) that I am not able to get internet up to full speeds. Here are the symptoms I've observed in the past few weeks.  ol liI re-install macOSX from bootable hard-drive (without removing any files from the mac) and internet works very well for 2-3 days and then it sticks./li liBy sticking of the internet I mean that when I view network data packets/bytes through activity monitor it shows spikes of internet availability. From 500+ KB/s the speed reduces to less than 10KB/s and then 0 for a few seconds, then again a spike of around 10KB/s and so on./li liOne other thing I notice is that, when internet issue happens and I restart the modem, the internet again works very well but for a few (just few) minutes and then again sticks./li liOne strange thing I notice is suppose I've restarted the modem and let's suppose the internet works fine for the first 3 minutes and then sticks. If I start to download a big file within those first three seconds, then it will continue to download to the full speed of the internet (500KB/s) even after those first 3 seconds. But browsing is too slow after the first 3 seconds of modem restart./li liThe other strange thing is when the internet problem occurs, the internet also stops working on other devices connected to the wifi. But if I disconnect macbook from the wifi, the internet on other devices starts working fine./li liSometimes, when this problem is present and I reload a page then it reloads just fine but opening a new page/website is not possible. Similarly with this problem present, sometimes a few websites (Gmail (http://gmail.com)) loads just fine but other sites don't./li /ol  So in short here are a few ways to temporarily get internet working to its normal (fine) state:  ul liRe-installing macOSX without cleaning SSD drive = Internet works fine for 1-2 days this way, then sticks./li liRe-starting the macbook = Internet works fine for 2-3 minutes this way, then sticks./li liRestarting the wifi-modem/router = Internet works fine for 2-3 minutes this way, then sticks./li liEven Clean-Installing solved the problem just for a few days./li /ul  Please suggest authentic ways to diagonise the problem and solve it. Thanks in advance.
