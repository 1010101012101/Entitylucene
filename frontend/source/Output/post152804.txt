Change Managed, Mobile Account Password through script? <body> Wondering if anyone has worked with something similar before - we have a number of Mac laptops connected to an Active Directory server, and on first login users create a Managed, Mobile account. When people change their password, we run into issues with keychain passwords out of sync. What I want to do is create a small program that changes the password through an interface, and if successful, removes the normally problematic keychain entries. I have all the code working, except for the password change script.  Will emdscl/em work for active directory/LDAP password changes? If so, is this the best way to do it? Would love to see some of the ways people have accomplished this. Applescript/Bash/Python are usually my tools of choice, but I'm open to other methods.
