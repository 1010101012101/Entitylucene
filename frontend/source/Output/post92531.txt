Can I override the action MacOS 10.8 performs for the triple-finger-tap gesture? <body> MacOS looks-up the word under the cursor in Dictionary.app when you triple-finger-tap. Instead I would like to open a new tab in Chrome and Google that keyword. Is this possible?  <answer92532> BetterTouchTool is an application that lets you assign configure gestures and trigger actions from your Trackpad. I'm not sure if it will allow this specific case but you should definitely be able to get something close.  <answer92539> Mike is right, Better Touch Tool can do the exact same thing you want. I was really lost when I upgraded to 10.7 and all its new gestures : BTT allowed me to restore my old 10.6 gestures. Download Better Touch Tool for free here.  Then open the Better Touch Tool preferences.   ol liSelect Gestures/li liThen be sure to select Global in the side bar.

With the existing three finger gesture, it selects the text under the cursor as well. I'll see if I can make it do that with some research. <comment108542> K, as a hack, I made it a two stage gesture. Fake-double-click first (selects word—generally), and then open in Google! Thanks!
