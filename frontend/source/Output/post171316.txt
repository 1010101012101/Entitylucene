Some videos won't play through icloud.com <body> I have an iPhone 5s and have enabled the iCloud Photo Library. Recently I shot five video clips with my phone and they got synced to iCloud. One of them plays fine through icloud.com. Three don't even show a thumbnail (and won't play of course) and one shows the thumbnail but doesn't play (shows a "cannot load video" message). However, all of them play fine on my phone and I can even download them from icloud.com and they play fine on my Windows computer.  Has anyone faced a similar problem?  <comment201636> Have you tried using a different browser to view them on iCloud.com? The browser may not support the video codec necessary. (Unlikely but worth checking.) <comment201912> Yes, I've tried different browsers, but that's not the problem. Please note that all the other videos play fine, it's just those four that don't.
