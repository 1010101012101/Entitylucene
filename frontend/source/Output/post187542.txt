4SNS TCBC - Which Mac Pro sensor is that? <body> Briefly my Mac Pro (4,1 Early 2009 ) stopped booting which I emeventually/em traced to the plastic clip holding the north bridge down failing. Seems to be a common issue.  Replaced the clips and now it will boot again and is stable but refuses to emrun/em the 2nd CPU. Kernel boot messages show it's there but disabled.  Apple hardware test gives error of 4SNS/1/40000000: TCBC-252:000 which from various sites on the net I understand to mean  pre 4SNS - Sensor TCBC |----- Temperature  |---- CPU   |--- CPU B ?    |-- C ?` /pre  Any idea on the numbers ?  Can anyone help me diagnose here, is it new Heatsink time or new Logic board time. Neither is great but a heatsink is much cheaper than a logic board.Is it something else that's fixable ?  ul liBoth CPUs verified good in socket A.  /li liAll RAM verified good in Socket A RAM slots. /li liNo diagnostic LEDs lit./li liNew thermal paste everywhere/li liSMC reset/li liPRAM reset/li /ul  EDIT: RAM Clarification EDIT: Things done Thanks  <answer187704> I rang Apple in the end, they didn't know either without seeing it. 8-)   Suggested I take it in for a free diagnosis.  Before I did that I tried taking the heatsink sensors connected off and replacing it.  Bingo, all fixed.   So the answer must be that this error is the heatsink sensor.  <comment221693> reset SMC already? [idk the numbers, sorry.] If the clip failed, it might have fried something. New paste everywhere? (wow, that was stream of consciousness, sorry) <comment221700> @tetsujin Tried all that. Must have redone the CPUs and paste 5 times by now. As they work in either socket at least I know they're ok. My theory is I damaged the CPU board or heatsink whilst replacing the thermal paste somehow. So want to know what the code actually means.
