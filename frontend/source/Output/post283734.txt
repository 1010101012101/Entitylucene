System freezes, keyboard/trackpad stops working, closing the screen locks the computer, and rebooting fixes the problem <body> Sorry for the long and weird title, but it was the only way I could think of to describe what I experienced.  So, what just happened was that my entire machine froze up. Neither the keyboard (built in), nor the touchpad (built in) did anything. However, it seems to register that I pressed the power button on the keyboard, as it asked me it I wanted to shut the computer down. Closing the screen returned me to the login screen, but I was unable to do anything there. I continued to press the power button until the system rebooted itself. It woke up without any problems, and I was able to log in using both the keyboard and trackpad as before. A popup notified me that something had happened, but I did not see any details.  Some background information: I have been running some heavy programs lately, like Docker using up ~1.5GB ram, and PyCharm using about the same + Spotify, Opera/Chrome, and Slack. Perhaps the computer was too hot?  This happens from time to time on my MacBook Pro mid 2014 running macOS Sierra 10.12.4. I guess it is not a very big problem as it does not happen very often. Perhaps once in a month, or possibly even rarer than this. What puzzles me is how some of the system seem to respond to what is going on, while most of it completely shuts down. I did not have any audio playing or any moving images, so I am unable to tell if that crashed too.  Is there any way to investigate these crashes further? Are there any log files that are dumped when crashes like these occur, but are not reported to the user? Furthermore, is this a known issue/problem? I have used OS X for years now and this type of crash confuses me, before if something similar happened on a Windows machine, the entire thing would fall apart, show a blue screen and reboot, while macOS seem to handle things in a weird way.
