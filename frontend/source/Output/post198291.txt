How to add a text/input field into PDF on Mac <body> I have a PDF form where some manager should write down the relevant data. I want to add an text/input field to this PDF file to simplify this process - now it is just printed lines to fill by handwriting.  After I add the text field I send the PDF file to the manager.  Any suggestions, soft etc are welcome (Right now I have only the Preview  and a Google Docs account).   <answer198295> For development of forms, get Acrobat Pro, and for using the forms, have your users using Acrobat Reader.  Important: Never, ever, ever use Preview.app for working with forms; Preview.app is a very sure tool to completely corrupt a PDF form.  <comment237244> 450$ ?? for a text field? hm... <comment237270> I agree with Max. you want to edit a PDF, Acrobat is the gold standard. I believe there are others available for Mac tho, a quick search will turn them up. Also I've **never** had Preview corrupt a PDF <comment237403> @SteveChambers: Then you never worked with fillable forms you had to send back for further processing using Preview.app. <comment237406> Actually I have, many times, just never had a problem
