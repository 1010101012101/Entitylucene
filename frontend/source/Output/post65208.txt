What determines whether podcasts are played individually or sequentially on an iPod? <body> What determines whether podcasts are played individually or sequentially on an iPod?  Basically, I have a lot of podcasts on my iPod.br At one point, it would play just one podcast, and then stop. There was a period of a few weeks where I didn't listen to podcasts, and now when I go to listen to a podcast, when I finish one, the iPod begins playing the next.   This is an issue for me because I generally listen to podcasts when going to sleep. As such, the iPod generally goes through maybe ~10 podcasts overnight, and I loose track of where I was.  hr  Basically, originally my iPod played podcasts one-by-one, I changed something, and now it does not.   However, I've been through the menus on the iPod, and I cannot see anything that looks like it would be related to the podcast playback behaviour. Whatever was changed, It's not readily apparent the effects it has.  <answer65266> Yup, this is kind of frustrating.  I haven't had the time to figure out whether it is a technical or configuration issue, but my solution is to put all podcasts that I want to play sequentially in a playlist.  So without playlist, they play individually, but in a playlist they play sequentially very well.  <answer65438> I added emone/em of the podcasts to a on-the-go playlist, and suddenly strongall/strong the podcasts are playing individually, rather then sequentially.  I have no idea why adding emone/em podcast to the in-the-go playlist affected strongevery/strong podcast, or what would actually be required to return the behaviour to the way it used to be (sequential playing), but there you are.  <comment76601> As a side-note: DERP. <comment76692> You're answer is the exact **opposite** of what I want. I'm having issues because all my podcasts are playing sequentially, and I want them to play *individually*
