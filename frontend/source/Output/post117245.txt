Must I log in upon connecting to a computer via VNC? <body> Can I turn off logging into a computer after connecting via VNC if I have a password set for connecting to the VNC server itself? will I need to enter a password somewhere before connecting?  <answer117273> No.  Basically VNC works by displaying a login session on your remote computer so if you don't allow strongany/strong logins to the computer it has nothing to display.
