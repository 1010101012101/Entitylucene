Running a script with assets inside automator application <body> So, I'm trying to write an automator application that runs a simple script.  precodepython Contents/main.py /code/pre  where codeContents/code is the contents of the code.app/code.  When the script is run it is run in code~/code not in the working directory (wherever the file is placed on a system).  Is there a way to do this?  Note: I am not taking any input to the application, you just double click it.  Thanks, Harry  <answer153631> You can get the path to Your executable from codeps/code command. You need to know Your app name. Here's my code with strongEchoPath.app/strong made in emAutomator/em:  precodeDIR=`ps x | grep EchoPath | grep -v grep | cut -c 28- ` /code/pre  Sample output:  precode/Users/slozo/Desktop/EchoPath.app/Contents/MacOS/Application Stub /code/pre  codeApplication Stub/code is the default name of the executable created in emAutomator/em. Knowing this path You can get the path to codeContents/code dir with codedirname/code command.  <comment180855> Thanks for your help, testing now <comment180856> Doesn't seem to work - changed the name and it returns nothing <comment180857> What is in the file if You do this: `echo ${DIR}  ~/Desktop/path.txt` after the command I pasted? My `path.txt` contains correct path. <comment180858> I figured it out, it doesn't work when debugging in Automator, but works when the application is run normally.
