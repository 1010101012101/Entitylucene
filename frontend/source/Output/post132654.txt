Custom keyboard shortcuts/mapping <body> I have been fiddling around with the keyboard shortcuts in sys preferences, and have to say the options seem limitless, and fantastic. I'm a huge keyboard user and will do everything I can without using a pointing device.  I have however a huge preference for using the bottom-left-most button for all modifier actions (instead of the default kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd ). This is not even related to "being used to how Windows works", I simply find it very uncomfortable to use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd  - the kbd Fn /kbd button on my laptop is actually what I've been using.  So - I could not find any other way than to use the custom shortcuts, and had to map each action one by one. I set most of them to "All Applications" (Copy, Paste, Cut, Save, Select All, Undo, Redo, Refresh, Close Tab, etc.)  My issue is this : because we have to use the exact Menu Name, it turns out that setting kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd W /kbd  to "Close Tab" in Google Chrome, will not "Close tab" in Filezilla.  It also turns out that I cannot re-use kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd W /kbd for more than one action. In other words, I can't use custom shortcuts if the action has a different name in different software.  Is there a way around this?br Much appreciated,  <answer219534> You can actually just remap the Modifier keys, if that would help - it would save you having to try modifying all the standard shortcuts.
