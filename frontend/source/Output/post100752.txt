Launch XQuartz app via Automator <body> I'm trying to launch meld (installed via Homebrew) via an app shortcut, ideally ending up in my Applications folder. A recommended way to launch console apps in Mountain Lion seems to be using Automator.  Running code/usr/local/bin/meld/code in a terminal starts XQuartz and meld launches fine. My Automator script looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qEm7P.png" alt="Automator script"   But when running all I get is the 'Run Shell Script failed' error. XQuartz doesn't launch. If XQuartz is already running meld still doesn't start.  ol liIs there a way to get more useful (stdout/stderr) from Automator actions?/li liWhat does the shell do differently do launch XQuartz and apps within it?/li /ol  Edit: I can get it to work by using codeopen /usr/local/bin/meld/code in my action, but I then also get a Terminal window (which I don't want).  <answer100754> Aha. Looks like Homebrew wants to run meld via it's own Python, rather than the system one. Terminal sets this up correctly, but obviously Automator doesn't.  Solution: use Run Shell Script in Automator with:  precode/usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/meld /code/pre  <comment118586> Can you mark this as the solution please? <comment118600> @Lyken not for a couple more days :)
