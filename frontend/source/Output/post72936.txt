iphone pdf app that doesn't scroll <body> I often use my iphone to scan through presentations that are stored as pdfs. Often, the information on the following page of a document is the same as the previous page plus some extra information. What I find annoying is that the pdf readers I have tried so far all "animate" the scrolling to the next page. All I want is an instant "next page", like one gets when one makes the presentation.  I have looked at myPDFs and Adobe acrobat.  Can anyone suggest an app that has ability?  <answer73002> iBooks, the free ebook reading app from Apple, paginates both ebooks (in epub format) and pdfs. It is not instant, though.
