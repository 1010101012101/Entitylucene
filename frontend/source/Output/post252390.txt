Avoid double keystrokes for a given set of keys on OS X <body> I am looking for a program for OS X that can prevent the user from inputting the same key twice in less than X milliseconds. The set of keys for which this limitation applies to should be configurable.  Any price and license is fine.  <comment314026> Take a look at [this](https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).

Also there is over a thousand questions in the software recommendation tags. <comment314030> I'm going by this: "Basic Customer Support or **questions asking to recommend or find off-site resources (Mac/book/software/tutorial) are off-topic for Ask Different** as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, edit to clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it.".  To me, this means this question should be asked on the SR site.
