How to disable Xcode's '"ProjectName" is a project downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?' dialog? <body> This is not a question on how to disable the warning when opening files or apps downloaded from the internet but instead it is about Xcode Projects.  New with Xcode 7.3 released yesterday whenever a project is opened for the first time that was downloaded from the internet a warning pops up asking      “ProjectName” is a project downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure   you want to open it?   How do I disable this warning from popping up?  <answer252475> precodexattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Path/ProjectName /code/pre  <comment283333> Have you looked through the Xcode Preferences for any new settings? <comment330268> Unfortunately this does not work. The warning remains. Also, listing the attributes on the project directory with "xattr -rp com.apple.quarantine /Path/ProjectName" says this attribute is not set on the directory nor on its files.
