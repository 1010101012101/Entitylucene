Macbook stuck on black loading screen <body> Today my Macbook Pro 2013 crashed so I hard reset it.  Since then it boots to a black loading screen with the apple logo and a loading bar in the middle. The loading bar progresses to around 60% then stops.   I can't boot into recovery or safe mode and I've tried the usual trouble shooting steps to no avail.  I'm at a loss because I can't even boot to internet recovery (it loads initially but then restarts).  Do you have any advice on what I can try next?  Edit: I'm not sure if this is related but the display also stopped working, I can only see the loading bar by plugging in an external monitor through the HDMI port.  Edit2: I can boot into single user mode run codefsck -yf/code but this reports that Macintosh HD is OK  Thanks  <answer247104> When you don't get to a blue screen in the boot process, you can assume an OS reinstall should fix it. Your fsck results reinforce that as next step.   I would boot to Internet recovery and download the OS installer of choice if your Mac supports that.   ul lihttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH22136/li /ul  When that is done, next is  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH21900/li /ul  That article has the reinstall steps linked at the bottom.
