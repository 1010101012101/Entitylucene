Remove "Other..." from Login screen <body> I've just upgraded to El Capitan from Mountain Lion, and now an "Other..." icon appears right next to my usual user-account em(admin account)/em on the login screen. When I click on it, I can log in, as another user, but I only have one.  My first thought was, that it could be the root user, which could have been enabled (I don't know how though). But from the Edit menu, in the Directory Utility, it only says "Enable root user", which should indicate that the root user is disabled. I then tried to enable it, and disable it again, but the "Other..." still appears on the login screen.  I've even tried to disable it from Terminal using this command, with no luck:  precodedsenableroot -d /code/pre  After some search on Google, I found a thread with people having the same problem. A lot of them solved the problem by following this guide:  ol liEnable the root user from Directory Utility and then log out./li liLog in as the root user account and change the password./li liStill on the root user account, disable and then enable root user from Directory Utility./li liLog out from the root user account, and log back it to the usual account./li liNow disable the root user once again./li /ol  I have done all this, but it still doesn't work, and I almost going mad about it.  Anyone have any idea why this is happening, and how to fix it?  <answer232451> I finally found a solution!  After some more search I found this command:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool FALSE /code/pre  ..and it did the trick!  <comment372260> This also works for macOS Sierra. I suddenly had this rogue "other" user appearing on my login screen and couldn't find any tips how to get rid of it. Nice find and thanks for sharing!
