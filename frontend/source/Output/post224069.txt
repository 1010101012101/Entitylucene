iPhone - prevent automatic hotspot tethering when connecting to computer <body> How can I turn off automatic personal hotspot activation when connecting an iPhone to a computer (Windows in this case)?  I had it plugged in when downloading an iOS update and it downloaded the update over cellular data instead of home Wi-Fi.   I understand I can turn it off manually each time by going into settings, but how can I have it not turn on automatically so that I can only turn it on manually as desired to prevent accidental usage?  <answer227342> The iOS device will use use data over Personal Hotspot if it is turned on and the device is connect to a computer via USB cable. Here is the documentation from Apple:      When your connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer with a USB   cable, Personal Hotspot automatically shares an Internet connection   with your computer. For example, when you connect your iPhone to your   computer to charge, your computer will use Internet from Personal   Hotspot on your iPhone. To avoid unnecessary data charges, turn off   Personal Hotspot when it isn't in use.   The only way to prevent unwanted data usage when using USB is to turn off Personal Hotspot via Settings  Personal Hotspot.   <answer227493> The problem isn't on your iPhone, it's on your Windows computer using the USB tether rather than Wifi. You need to set the network interface priority on your Wifi to be higher than the USB device, or the USB device to be lower, so that it will only use the tether if it isn't connected to Wifi.  Make sure to connect the iPhone first. Directions for Windows 7 are here (these will likely work on newer versions as well):  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2526067  Alternately you could disable the connection on your Windows computer but you'll still have to manually turn it on each time so I think the above fix will provide the result you want.  <answer283316> Here are instructions how to use the command line to change the priority of the network interface to get Windows to route the traffic through WIFI adapter instead of iPhone. This is tested on Windows 10.   ol liOpen up PowerShell with admin rights/li liUse the route print to find the correct interface/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/feQLv.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liCheck the index (the first column) for the "Apple mobile device ethernet". In my case this is 25. Use then Get-NetIPInterface command to see associated metrics values for each interface/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eGjka.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liCheck the InterfaceMetric value. The interfaces will be ordered using this value, so you want to change the Apple device to to use a value higher than for example your WIFI connection. In my case both Apple and WIFI share the value 35, so to guarantee the order I want to put the Apple device value to 45. /li liUse Set-NetIPInterface command to specify the value:  Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex 25 -InterfaceMetric 45/li liRunning again the route print command shows that in my case the Apple Mobile device ethernet and my WLAN adapter has now changed the positions, meaning Windows will route the traffic through the WIFI instead of via iPhone/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yaCw6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment278381> Data is only used if the connection has the highest network interface priority. The exception is if the connection you're trying to make is to the phones IP address. <comment325909> How can we do this on Windows 10? I've looked at every setting in the Control Panel under "Network and Sharing Center", but there's no option to change connection priorities. <comment328436> There seems to be some issues with this on Win 10. Here is the best fix I could find https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/networking/2015/08/14/adjusting-the-network-protocol-bindings-in-windows-10/ <comment357168> The page @ToddDabney linked mentions you can use the Get-NetIPInterface and Set-NetIPinterface PowerShell commands to change the priority (run these in elevated shell) <comment357191> Do you have to do this every reboot or just one time? <comment360522> @g491 Looks like this was not a permanent fix, this no longer worked after reboot. One problem is also that this is using the interface id (25), which is likely to change at some point. You could probably replace that with `Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceAlias "Apple Mobile Device Ethernet" -InterfaceMetric 45` The command `Get-NetIPInterface` shows the list of interfaces. Another issue is that this maybe cannot be done at the boot time, but only when iPhone is connected. There's some trick for running scheduled task when connection becomes available and that might be useful here.
