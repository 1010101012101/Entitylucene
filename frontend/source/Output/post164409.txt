Applescript read specific data out of iWork Numbers <body> I am trying to get data out of a table in Numbers. I have an index number, I need to get the name associated with it in applescript. (Eventually I need to set names of files with one of columns of this number sheet)  here is what I got:  precodetell application "iTunes"     repeat with theTrack in selection         set theFile to location of theTrack         tell application "Finder" to set theName to name of theFile         set surahNameAsString to characters 1 thru 3 of theName as text         --set album of theTrack to surahName         set surahNumber to surahNameAsString as integer         log ("here")          set aName to my getAName(surahNumber)          --set the year of theTrack to 1985      end repeat end tell  on getAName(surahNumber)     tell application "Numbers"         activate         set t to front document's active sheet's first table's cell whose value is surahNumber         --set t to front document's active sheet's first table's first column         repeat with c in t             set theValue to c's value         end repeat     end tell     return theValue end getAName /code/pre  <answer164435> this is how I solved it:  precodetell application "iTunes"      repeat with theTrack in selection          set theFile to location of theTrack         tell application "Finder" to set theName to name of theFile          set ayahInSurahCount to 0          --set ayah information from the name of the track          set surahNumAsString to characters 1 thru 3 of theName as text         set surahNumber to surahNumAsString as integer          set ayahNumberAsString to characters 4 thru 6 of theName as text         set ayahNumber to ayahNumberAsString as integer         -- finished          set track number of theTrack to ayahNumber         set genre of theTrack to "Genre"         --getting information from the number sheet         set aName to my getAName(surahNumber)         --set englishName to my getEnglishName(surahNumber)         -- finished         set the album of theTrack to surahNumAsString &amp; "-" &amp; aName         set artist of theTrack to "Abdul Basit"         set shufflable of theTrack to false         --set description of theTrack to englishName         set name of theTrack to ayahNumberAsString &amp; " - "      end repeat end tell  on getAName(surahNumber)     tell application "Numbers"         activate         tell document 1             tell sheet 1                 tell table 1                     set ret to value of cell 1 of row surahNumber                     --set value of cell 5 of row 1 to "Salam"                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell     return ret end getArabicName  on getEnglishName(surahNumber)     tell application "Numbers"         activate         tell document 1             tell sheet 1                 tell table 1                     set ret to value of cell 3 of row surahNumber                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell     return ret end getEnglishName /code/pre  <comment192757> You need to also show an example of the numbers doc. And explain what your script is failing to do rather than us trying to run it on a doc that is nothing like yours.... <comment192801> Solved what?. We do not know what your original script was failing to do?
