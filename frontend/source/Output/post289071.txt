How do I reset all gatekeeper rules? <body> So I made a really stupid mistake and while trying to delete a gatekeeper rule from the command line I managed to delete all of them.  strongCommand I ran/strong  precodespctl --remove /code/pre  strongNew Output of List/strong  precodeNathaniels-MacBook-Pro:~ nathanielsuchy$ spctl --list error: no matches for search or update operation /code/pre  Before it had a ton of rules. How do I reset gatekeeper to factory defaults?  <answer289072> Luckily for me I knew how to read the man pages. From that I found a default copy was at /var/db/SystemPolicy-default and was able to copy it to the normal system policy location  strongCommand To Run:/strong  precodeNathaniels-MacBook-Pro:~ nathanielsuchy$ sudo cp /var/db/.SystemPolicy-default /var/db/SystemPolicy /code/pre  strongFrom the Man Pages/strong  precodeFILES      /var/db/SystemPolicy  The system policy database.      /var/db/.SystemPolicy-default                            A copy of the initial distribution version of the                            system policy database.  Useful for starting over                            if the database gets messed up beyond recognition. /code/pre  The developers included a default copy to ensure that if you mess up the database, you can simply copy the default database to the database location, reboot, and be ready to roll.  However there is an even easier way to do this, it's also the recommended way. See the man pages:  precode --reset-default           Unconditionally reset the system policy database to its default           value. This discards all changes made by administrators. It also           heals any corruption to the database. It does not implicitly           either enable or disable the facility. This must be done as the           super user. Reboot after use. /code/pre  Just run:  precodesudo spctl --reset-default /code/pre  and then reboot your Mac and everything will be back to normal.  strongFixed Output:/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H6eEX.png" alt="system enabled with default rules again"  strongNow everything's back to normal:/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfnbH.png" alt="screenshot of blocked execution" As shown I cannot install any new apps that are not from the App Store. While the gatekeeper system is disabled or if it has no rules, I can load the app without an issue. Thought disabling gatekeeper isn't recommended from a security context, it's better to grant exemptions to trusted and verified apps that are not signed, though the best and most security friendly way to do things is to sign your apps without an exeception.  In the future always be careful when adjusting gatekeeper rules though I'm glad there's a simple way to reset it back to the default set of rules. It could of been a lot worse without a copy of the default rule set.  <comment373771> Thank you for sharing this but it seems like this does not really work, at least in Sierra. I tried both (--reset-default and replacing the file) but either way the applications that I approved before can still be run. This is not really a reset then I suppose. Any idea why this is?
