If someone blocks my number on their iPhone, can I still iMessage them through a linked email on my Messages app on macbook? <body> So basically, my sister blocked me on her iPhone (iOS8) because she's being immature and I really need her to read my message. If I iMessage her through my Messages app, and start the conversation from one of my linked e-mails, will it go through to her? I just don't know if when someone blocks an iPhone number, it automatically blocks all linked accounts... I kind of feel like it's not that advanced.  If anyone knows, could you please let me know? Thanks!  <comment207111> If that was the case, wouldn't she just block that one as well? <comment207135> I don't think it does, but I'm not sure. Maybe you have a buddy with iMessage to try out? Let him block your number and try sending him a message via the mailaddress
