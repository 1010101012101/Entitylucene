Car enter/exit options not available in reminders <body> I got a new Accord which has CarPlay and even though I have used it with my iPhone 7 (10.2.1) daily for a couple weeks now the location options in reminders does not show the two car options. I don't see where I need to turn anything on to get these options. If I create a reminder via Siri I can use the car location settings successfully so they do work on the phone. Does anyone know what I need to do to fix this?
