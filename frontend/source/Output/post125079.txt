What's the menu area near the clock called? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0ExP.png" alt="time machine, bluetooth, wifi, volume, battery, clock"  What is the part of the menu bar called with the time machine, bluetooth, wifi, volume and battery icons called? (Near the clock)  I wanted to search how to remove unused icons from it (like timemachine)  hr  Edit: How can I get rid of this icon in my menu bar? How can I put the icon back?  I'd still like to know what it's called, like the system tray on Windows.  <answer125080> These are called emmenu extras/em.   They are different from status bar items (which are usually used in other apps) in that you can hold kbdcommand/kbd and drag them around.   Each of these can be turned on and off with a checkbox in System Preferences (the Bluetooth one can be toggled in Bluetooth preferences, etc.)  <answer125133> The answer above is true. To add to that:  strikeThey're also known as menu items./strike You can also remove them by holding down the command key and dragging them out of the menu and it will strikerelease its magic smoke/strike be removed from the menu bar. (Just like you can remove items from the dock).  I have found one instance where a menu item couldn't be removed by simply holding down the command key and dragging it off the menu. In this case you will have to hunt around the file system and remove it manually.  To reload the menu extras (which I believe is the correct Apple name for them as per answer above), you can just restart or for advanced:  In Terminal:  precodekillall -KILL SystemUIServer /code/pre  to check to see if you have got rid of that pesky menu extra that you wanted to get rid of. If its still running, keep hunting!  <comment192950> To remove the Time Machine icon, go to Preferences  Time Machine  untick "Show Time Machine in menu bar.
