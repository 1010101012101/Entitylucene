Does iMessage require SMS to activate? <body> I am overseas at the moment and I have bought a SIM which has plenty of data, but the plan doesn't include SMS. I have tried activating iMessage again as my phone number is different, but it is stuck on waiting for activation. When I turn on iMessage it comes up with "Your carrier may charge for SMS messages used to activate iMessage."  Does this mean that iMessage uses SMS to activate? I have a little bit of credit for calls which I'm assuming if you send a text it uses a bit of it since the plan doesn't include SMS.   strongIs there any other way I can activate iMessage?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4v4JK.jpg" width="320"  <answer254135> To activate iMessage for a phone number, the device sends a silent SMS with a verification code. Carriers approved by Apple do not charge for this SMS. Activating without sending an SMS only activates iMessage for your Apple ID email address, not your phone number.  <comment316344> So is it a matter of talking to the carrier or is it a problem with Apple? I have activated iMessage before on this carrier. How do I find out if the carrier is "approved" by Apple? <comment316398> @Mekul It's a matter with the carrier. If the carrier appears in [this list](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204039), you *should* be ok. <comment316413> it *does* appear in the list. I'm assuming it doesn't work because the plan doesn't include SMS. Thanks for your help anyway. <comment316809> Turns out that you needed a bit more credit to send an SMS as the carrier do charge you! Thanks for your help.
