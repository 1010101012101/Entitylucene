7s stuck in recovery after ios11 downgrade <body> I have ready other answers and tried those tips with regards to manually installing the ispw but it doesn't do anything. I still end up stuck with the connect to iTunes logo on screen.   I am currently using an android device so if this phone is bricked apple can get stuffed i'lll stick with android. Haha. There wasn't much data on the phone tbh so I full reset isn't a problem.   <comment364666> Possible duplicate of [iPhone 7 Plus stuck in recovery mode and can't restore/update even in DFU after downgrading from iOS 11](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287747/iphone-7-plus-stuck-in-recovery-mode-and-cant-restore-update-even-in-dfu-after) Also https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/288559/can-i-downgrade-from-ios-11-developer-beta-im-not-worried-about-data-preservat?noredirect=1&lq=1 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/286346/downgrade-from-ios-11-beta-to-ios-10-3-2-and-restore-ios-11-backup
