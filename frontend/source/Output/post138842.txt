What happened to the AppleMasters? <body> What happened to the celebrity AppleMasterssup†/sup program that used to live on Apple's website? Is it closed down? Are there any fan sites out there for the AppleMasters?  sup†) link defunct/sup  <answer138845> From AppleMasters wikipedia page:     The AppleMasters program was launched in 1996.sup[3]/sup Based on findings at archive.org's WayBackMachine, Apple removed the program from their web site on or before August 7, 2002.sup[4]/sup   So it seems the feature has been long gone, which can be confirmed from the linked Internet Archive crawl index.  As for the "fan sites": I found one self-proclaimed fan site: kdunn.org. It currently hosts two videos—presumably related to AppleMasters.  You would probably have much better results searching the YouTube for AppleMasters than searching for fan sites emper se/em.  <comment163988> Thanks Koiyo. Good work.
