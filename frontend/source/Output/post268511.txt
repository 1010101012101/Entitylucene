Passing arguments to a shell script wrapped inside a macOS app <body> I would like to run a shell script inside an app (XPprog.app) with input arguments. More specifically, I would like to mac-ify some old WinXP simple programs using wine:  precode#!/bin/bash /opt/local/bin/wine TombStone.exe $1 /code/pre  Double clicking on a document for the codemyXPapp.exe/code or dropping the document on my codeXPprog.app/code should open the XP program in wine, opening the document.  This works perfectly fine if I execute the shell script manually from Terminal,  and it also works fine to open the codeTombStone.exe/code in wine by launching the codeXPprog.app/code. However, if I associate the document with XPprog.app and double-click on the document, an empty document is opened. Same thing if I drop the document on the "XPprog.app" symbol. The document name and path is not passed on to the shell script inside XPprog.app/Contents/MacOS.  I can imagine that it is possible to do with a properly configured Info.plist, but this is outside my competence.  Here is the exact script content (myApp.app/Content/MacOS/myapp.sh):  precode#!/bin/bash /opt/local/bin/wine TombStone.exe "$1" /code/pre  If I write the following on the terminal:  precodeopen myApp.app --args myfile.tom /code/pre  it works fine, the WinXP application opens the document as desired.  Now, if I associate my document "myfile.tom" with myApp and double-click on the document, I get:     "The document "myfile.tom" could not be opened. Wine cannot open files   of this kind"   Apparently, the document param was replacing the wine param for the exe file, not added as a param for the exe as I intended in the script. This behaviour is not enirely predictable, sometimes just an empty document is opened.  20170113: I solved it by using Platypus as suggested, thanks for this. Works fine, but it would have been nice to understand how it works...:)  <comment337126> Very probably relevant, from the Unix & Linux Stack Exchange: [Why does my shell script choke on whitespace or other special characters?](http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/131766/135943) <comment337135> "*the wrapped shell script does not work*" -- what does it mean? What is the result?
