Transfer songs purchased on iphone 4 to computer <body> How do I transfer songs purchased from my iphone to itunes on my computer?  I only want to transfer purchased music, not apps or other purchases.  <answer236983> Sync it with ITunes (if it isnt already) and sign in to itunes on your mac and it should (may take a minute or two) sync up.
