"Could not find installation information for this machine" after disk erase <body> I erased my disk while planing to reinstall the OS. Now I get the recovery screen as planed, I press "Reinstall OS X" and then press on "Continue". It checks my eligibility and tells me "Could not find installation information for this machine".  Obviously I cannot go back because the disk is already erased, and I have no time machine backups.  ul liI do remember having this issue in the past, and all I had to do is login to the AppStore. But now this is kinda not relevant (and I was logged in before I erased the disk)/li /ul  <answer244710> The only way out of this mess that I found was asking a friend to make me an installation USB, and use that to install the new OS.  Apple was not very clever with this, they could have made it possible to sign into the AppStore from the recovery screen as you obviously will reach it when you need to (re)install the OS...  <answer244713> In Recovery Mode you have to format your Disk using strongDisk Utility/strong and Choose strongOS X Extended (Journaled)/strong as drive format before you click Reinstall OS X.  <answer251668> If you are installing mac os on a fresh Hard Drive then rather pressing kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd on startup, you need to press and hold only kbdalt/opt/kbd key on system startup.  <answer260428> Just keep trying. It took me 10 times before it finally went through. No USB needed, just bad connection to the Apple server!  <answer268134> I resolved this issue by changing the Wi-Fi network I was connected to. I was on xfinitywifi which was requiring a registration I didn't see. As soon as I connected to my internal company Wi-Fi network without a click-through screen it worked.  <answer273597> Another method for those that might not have access to another Mac: I created a Hotspot without any security on my phone and connected the Mac to it for the activation part. Worked like a charm for me.   <answer276283> Check your wireless connection. Erasing the disks erases the WiFi information on the drive (it's located in your keychain), so when it reboots, it simply looks for the nearest WiFi SSID it can find, which may not be the right one. Click on the WiFi icon in the upper right hand corner and choose the correct SSID, then feed it any credentials it asks for. When it has the correct WiFi, try again.   <comment313108> Problem solved by asking a friend to make a bootable USB and installing from there. Thanks for the answers. <comment353611> My network also had a 'agree to network usage terms' box that needed to be clicked on before you were allowed to surf the Internet. This was preventing me to access the Internet and hence creating the fail condition.
