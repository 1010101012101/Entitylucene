Automator Service: Parent of input from files or folders <body> I cannot find emany/em information on this, so I hope somebody with experience can fill in the gap.  I am writing a simple Automator Service, and I can’t get past the first step.  ul liThe script is a codeService/code/li liService receives selected codefiles or folders/code in codeFinder.app/code/li licodeRun AppleScript/code/li /ul  The script is  precodeon run {input,parameters}     set test to container of input -- Can’t make container into type reference.     display dialog test as string     return input end run /code/pre  The codeinput/code parameter has the selected file or folder, and all I want to do at this stage is to get the parent folder of the selected item. Everything I try, which is from countless emnear/em solutions on the web fail in this, telling me that I can’t make the container into a reference.  I have no idea what I should be doing, and I can’t find any information on this.  How can I get the parent folder using Automator?  <answer269655> The curly-brace portion of codeon run {input, parameters}/code creates a emlist/em and as such you need to address eminput/em as a emlist/em.  The following example assumes only one file or folder gets passed to the Service:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "System Events"         set thePath to POSIX path of (container of (item 1 of input))     end tell     return thePath end run /code/pre  Can your Service receive more then one file or folder at a time? ... If yes, then you'll need to incorporate the emcode/em below.  The following example assumes multiple files or folders gets passed to the Service:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set pathList to {}     repeat with itemNum from 1 to count of input         tell application "System Events"             copy POSIX path of (container of (item itemNum of input)) to end of pathList         end tell     end repeat     return pathList end run /code/pre  hr  Reference: Getting the path of the parent folder of a file?  <comment338787> I didn’t realise that `input` was a list. Thanks for your solutions. I have turned the first one to a service to get the parent path, and modified the second to give me a list of full path names. Thanks. <comment370799> This doesn't work. Returns "Can't get container of "[selected file name].
