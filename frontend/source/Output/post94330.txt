How can I convert a DMG to ISO on Mac OS X (preferably for free)? <body> I have medical records within Windows software within a DMG disk image. How can I convert the DMG to an ISO format on Mac OS X? Is it possible to do it within Disk Utility or CLI easily, or do I need an external utility?  <answer94342> Yes, Disk Utility can do this. Use codeConvert/code then select your codedmg/code file. In the codeSave As/code dialog that follows, select codeDVD/CD master/code. Disk Utility will insist on saving the new ISO as a code.cdr/code file, but it is really an ISO. You can rename it to code.iso/code in the Finder, if you like.  At http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/18/convert-dmg-to-cdr-or-iso-with-disk-utility/ there are screen shots that walk through this process.  <answer159759> Renaming code.cdr/code to code.iso/code is a bad advice. An code.iso/code has a slightly different format that allows PC users to play the DVD as well.  A way to convert a code.cdr/code to an code.iso/code is:  precode$ hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o [filename].iso [filename].cdr /code/pre  <answer279076> Would be the same:  precodehdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o [filename].iso [filename].dmg /code/pre  For example:  precodehdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o output_file.iso file_to_convert.dmg /code/pre  <answer280537> You must mount the cdr people.  <comment187963> "it is really an ISO" is plain wrong. Seeing a .cdr from OSX, there appears to be no difference to a .iso . But you feel it after your DVD does not work on Windows. <comment201983> Or you can just use the `.dmg` directly as input instead of going through `.cdr`. <comment202037> yes, sure ;-) But please no renaming... <comment238285> I am still unhappy with the accepted answer. Both Sean and mblakele failed here, because an answer was accepted, that was only right for OSX users. But this will strike back, as soon as you try to use a renamed .iso in Windows. I think correctness is important, because wrong information should not be kept in the public, even if it's "just windows" ;-) <comment329900> This is still wrong, today. What a shame! <comment340439> @mblakele    What convert button?  Not seeing that on Disk Utility (version 16.0) . Am I doing this wrong, or is this answer just obsolete because of other software changes? <comment340658> @zipzit Apple likes to move things around from time to time. Try the `Images` menu, then `Convert...` <comment348585> What would be the command to convert a dmg directly to iso just for completion sake of the question? <comment352872> Welcome to Ask Different! Unfortunately, this doesn't look like an attempt to answer the question.
