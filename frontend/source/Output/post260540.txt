How to install user Applescripts for Safari and activate the Scripts menu item? <body> I want to add a user script to Safari and activate the Script menu for Safari.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/skrLE.png" alt="Script Menu Item"  I have seen some references which indicate this can be done by adding a .scpt to code~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari/code but that does not seem to work. Neither does code~/Library/Application Scripts/code.  <answer260542> You haven't specified the version of macOS or Safari you're running, but usually you would do this:  ol liIn the Finder, go to the top level of your Mac's hard drive (or SSD)/li liNavigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras//li liDouble-click on the strongScript Menu.menu/strong file/li /ol  This should add the Script Menu to a number of supported apps, etc.  <answer260569> You can go to strongScript Editor/strong  strongPreferences/strong, then check "Show Script menu in menu bar" and "Show Computer Scripts". Afterwards, the Script Editor menu bar should show.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LFM2W.jpg" alt="Script Editor General Preferences"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oPxvu.jpg" alt="Script Editor Menu Bar"  Then, you go to "strongOpen Scripts Folder/strong - strongOpen Safari Scripts Folder/strong", where the folder you specified will be added.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ypGGY.jpg" alt="Safari Scripts Folder"
