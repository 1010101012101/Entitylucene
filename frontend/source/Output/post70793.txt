Can I group canvases in OmniGraffle? <body> I have an OmniGraffle doc that is like 30 pages / canvases long. I'd like to organize the canvases into groups rather than just a long list. For example, I'd like to have 'Menu' below, under which the em'menu-'/em canvases would be grouped. This is what it looks like currently:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzEYN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'd like it to be grouped. Is this possible?  <answer70801> It is not currently possible to "Group Canvases" in OmniGraffle Pro 5.  You may email omnigraffle@omnigroup.com and request this as a feature, or visit http://forums.omnigroup.com/forumdisplay.php?f=4 and post this request.  <comment82246> thx for answer. seems right to me
