Problem with installing grunt (lodash@0.9.2) <body> I have iMac (ElCapitan) for few days and I try to install all needs for my work (templating for WordPress).  I try to install grunt, but I got WARN messages in terminal and I am absolutely out of what they mean:  precodenpm WARN deprecated lodash@0.9.2: lodash@&lt;3.0.0 is no longer maintained. Upgrade to lodash@^3.0.0. npm WARN deprecated lodash@2.4.2: lodash@&lt;3.0.0 is no longer maintained. Upgrade to lodash@^3.0.0. /code/pre  I have no idea, if that is problem in my computer, or grunt. I try to search by google, but I did not find any suitable answer or better answer which can clear this for me. ...will I need upgrade lodash@?  <answer217473> so it is just warning and grunt is installed. Yesterday was not present in system, but when I check now by grunt --version, I got answer about version of installed grunt.  I got confirmation on Github.
