IPhone: too much disk space is used for unknown reason <body> Here is a full list of all applications installed on the device:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMZhC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have already used Battery Doctor (and other apps) and cleaned cache. So what is 7.2 gb used for? How can i clean it?  I don't know if it can help but the phone was already in use before.  strongUpdate:/strong Settings - General - About screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDctI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer177713> Looks like that iOS is taking some space since it says the capacity is 12GB even though (I'm guessing) your device is 16GB.  <answer177813> It's a bit black magic - but after a wired sync with iTunes there's always some extra space freed up.  I suppose this does some extra cleaning tasks the iDevice won't do by itself.  <comment210316> Hi! I updated the question with more details. <comment210394> @tiktak I have updated my answer <comment210450> Yes, but it's unclear what 7.2gb is consumed for. <comment210451> @tiktak What I mean is iOS takes up that space. Remember if you update your iDevice without iTunes you need 5GB free to update. This is what is happening. the Operating System (iOS) is taking up the space. That is what I think anyway.
