How to make the terminal auto-complete from the command history? <body> In Linux, I had managed to set up the terminal in such a way that if I type part of a command and press the arrow key 'up', it would auto-complete with the last command that started with what I had typed.  I tried to do this following the instructions on http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20031026174236860, but it doesn't seem to work. Does anyone know how to set this up on a Mac?  <comment363104> Related: [Command-line completion from command history](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5366/command-line-completion-from-command-history) <comment363107> It's better to use ctrl+r to search your command history, that way you don't have to even remember the command name. It has sped up my terminal usage by many times. Highly recommended. Plus, I recommend the Z Shell and: http://ohmyz.sh <comment363266> In the end I installed Fish shell, which autocompletes from the history as you type, so you only have to press the right arrow to complete the command.
