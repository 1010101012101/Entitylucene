the same issue after installing ableton <body> codeFried Waffle/code could you please explain me step by step. As i found the same BluetoothAudioPlugin.driver" in Music/plugins/HAL. I was messing a lot with that folder as had to get rid off a lot ableton plugins, so it might cause the same issue. What i did i copied BluetoothAudioPlugin.driver file into original place which is /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins but still doesn't work.  Thanks  <comment338683> This probably refers to http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/223787/9058 but it might help if you are a bit more specific about what problem you want to solve and what you did already
