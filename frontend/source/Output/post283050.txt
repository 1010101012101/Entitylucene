Remove usb driver Asus <body> I want to remove the USB drivers of my AsusTek P027 ZenPad from my Mac. Is this possible?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/26ILN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment356875> As no-one's picked up on this one yet... Did you ever install any drivers? If so, running the package again may find an uninstaller. If not, then there are no specific drivers & the Mac 'just recognises it'. [Latter is most likely] <comment357497> *Why* do you want to remove it?  Is it causing a problem?
