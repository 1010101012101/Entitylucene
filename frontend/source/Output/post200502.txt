Why is my AppleScript not working? <body> Making an AppleScript but for some reason it isn't working. Any ideas why not?  precodedelay 1 set volume 1 say "Hello " &amp; (do shell script "whoami") using "Whisper" say "Do you want to play a game?" using "Whisper" display dialog "Do you want to play a game?" buttons {"Yes", "No"} default button 1 if the button returned of the result is "Yes" then -- say "Bwahahahaha!" else -- display dialog "Big mistake" &amp; (do shell script "whoami") end if /code/pre  <answer200517> Works for me, but I had to set volume 6 to make it audible.  "Big mistake" should be "Big mistake " -- that space matters.  <comment241600> It would be useful to describe the expected behavior <comment241608> Yeah. What do you want to achieve and where is it not working <comment241609> Is this related to this? http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/200172/120171 <comment241610> @bjbk You may be on to something... <comment241626> Ha, no, I just enjoy making pranks on applescript with my friends. <comment241795> I still can't get any audio on the action buttons, nothing happens. :( <comment241809> **--** comments out a line. So changing **-- say "Bwahahahaha!"** to **say "Bwahahahaha!"** should fix that <comment241857> Hey, do you have any ideas on how to make this even creepier?
