Why can't Software Update connect after SSD upgrade? <body> I upgraded my MacBook Pro (Early 2009) with a Samsung 830 SSD with 256GB and an iFixit hard drive bay. After cloning my harddrive with Carbon Copy Cloner to the SSD I put the SSD into the MacBook Pro and booted from it. It runs smooth, but Software Update and iTunes (and other apps) can't connect to their servers. Even Dropbox failed, while Google Drive gets a connection after reinstallation. Browsing and mailing havn't problems, too.  Someone could point out a possible reason and fix for that?  <comment58311> Can't see any plausible software link, I would be more inclined to think you have somehow affected your Wireless Antenna or something, during the hardweare swap.  You can plug your old hard disk in and prove it's not the SSD, I would expect the problems to continue.  If they are fixed, then I'm a) wrong, and also b) stumped. <comment58312> Are browsing and mailing having problems or not? The last sentence in your first paragraph is ambiguously worded. <comment58313> No problems with browsing and mailing, so far I experienced the problem with the iTunes Store, softwareupdate and Dropbox. <comment88549> I had a similar issue last night. I cloned my old HDD to SSD (Samsung 830) with CCC. When I booted up the SSD, Dropbox popped up as if it was just installed. I also got a similar message from LittleSnitch. Did you figure out what caused your issue? <comment88550> I didn't actually figured it out. But it disappeared the next day. Strange.
