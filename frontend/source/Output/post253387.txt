Whatsapp notifications on Iphone Lockscree show contact name instead of nickname <body> When I get a message with WhatsApp and my iPhone is locked, I cant see sender's name as they set it in their own WhatsApp (niockname), I used to see it but suddenly now I see the name which I have saved them in my Contact list. I would like to go back and that the nicknames appears on lock screen when I have a message instead of the Contact name.  Can anybody help? I don't want to delete the name in my contact list I just want it to be like it was previously.  thanks in advance, Ezio  <answer253677> have you checked your privacy settings? just make it sure that WhatsApp have access to your contacts. to do so just go to Settings  Privacy  Contacts and allow the WhatsApp to access your phone's contacts
