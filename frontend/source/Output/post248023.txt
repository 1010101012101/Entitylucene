automatic Finder column sizing? <body> I'm from the Windows world, new to Mac. I need the column view of the Finder for most work I do with it, but I'm frustrated that many of the file or folder names are too long to fit. I have read about tricks for "resizing" the columns, but (1) I need to minimize my mouse clicking due to repetitive strain injury, (2) it seems like an obvious function to just automatically size properly.   Also there is a difference between Mac and Windows algorithms for truncating names in general. Windows shows the first part of the name, as much as fits, while Mac shows the beginning and end of the name and takes away the middle. I find Mac style harder to read. Mentally I don't block out the dots, but rather see them as part of the name (which they aren't). And I can't think of any rationale for it, other than the benefit of knowing the file extension, there's no reason why it's more helpful to know the trailing characters than the middle characters. It's just harder to read. Is there a way to change that behavior?
