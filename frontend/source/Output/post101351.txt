How to copy/paste a formula down an entire column in Excel 2011? <body> I have a formula that references codeA1:B5/code for instance, the result lives in any arbitrary cell, say codeD1/code. How do I copy and paste the same formula, referencing the same values as in codeD1/code, through the entire column codeD/code? For some reason, I can't find this answer anywhere.  If I select codeD1/code for instance, and click the bottom right, and drag to use auto-fill, it seems to increment the codeA1:B5/code values which ruins the results.  <answer101819> Did you try copying the formula from D1 (select the cell and do Copy, not selecting the formula itself). Then select the range of cells D2 to D-whatever and paste. This should work as long as you don't have the text inside the formula definition box selected, but rather you copy the cell itself.   <answer118620> You need to use an absolute reference with code$/code.  So that the cell references never changes when doing a copy and paste or fill change it from codeA1:B5/code to code$A$1:$B$5/code.  If you want you can even make a reference that is half absolute. The reference code$D1/code means that when you copy and paste the codeD/code will stay the same but the row number will change.  <answer126800> You are using Fixed value ($) for Cell A and fixed for field 1 ($A$1) it will copy and repeat that in the row 1, but also in the coulomb D.   So try following $A1:$B5 (without $ for the field).   Now when you pull down it will copy correctly but also in the row 1  <comment119379> Try this: click a1:b5. Then in another cell, (a1:b6 for example), perform the formula you'd like to perform on a1:b5 (add 10% for example). Then copy a1:b6 - not a1:b5   Finally, highlight the set of cells where you want to paste this formula (for example a1:b10 to a1:b20), then paste. The results  formula in A1:b6 will be copied and run in a1:b10. those results should be copied to a1:b11 etc. <comment119397> You are using Fixed value ($) for Cell A and fixed for field 1 ($A$1) it will copy and repeat that in the row 1, but also in the coulomb D.
