How to Get a Similar color as LightSteelBlue3 in El Capitan? <body> I see many LaTeX threads with the font, etc here. I am interested in the similar colors as LightSteelBlue3 in OS X that are by default, because I cannot find the color in Homebrew and not by default.   In emTeX Live Utility/em, I find the packages emxcolor/em, emcolortbl/em and emcaption/em as eminstalled/em.   hr  How can you get a similar color as LightSteelBlue3 in El Capitan?  <answer234081> I assume you are referring to this answer. Just install codexcolor/code (and any other missing packages) via TeX Live Utility (or manually) and run codelatex/code as usual.  <comment286151> If you already have the packages installed, what exactly is your problem in using them? <comment286156> @patrix It says there is no such packages so they are not found for some reason. <comment286160> Please update your question then (Terminal output etc.), we can't see your screen :-) Might also help to know whether other packages installed via TLU work as expected. <comment286169> I accept this answer because I had some problems with the packages. The complication was caused by `Beamer` documentclass which confused me about the origin of the problem. A new thread about it here http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/302851/13173 in TeX Stackexchange.
