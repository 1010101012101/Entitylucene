Is it possible to hide dock on launch bar? <body> When I open the launch bar the dock is always there taking up spaces. Is there a terminal command that allow me to hide this?  <answer60655> The easiest way to hide the Dock is to press kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdD/kbd. Is there a specific reason you want to use a terminal command?  <comment69819> What do you mean by "open then launch bar"? <comment69837> Option-command-D doesn't do anything in Launchpad. <comment69839> Even if you could hide it, the space wouldn't probably be used to display more icons. You can change the number of rows or columns with for example `defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-columns -int 8; killall Dock`, but the maximum number of icons per page won't be increased. <comment69948> By launch bar do you mean **Launchpad**? <comment69996> @patrix I guess so...
