Apple ID and registration of a new device <body> I created a new Apple ID for my iPad. I did everything on the iPad. Now when I connect it to iTunes on my Mac, it asks to register my device and does not allow me to use the ID I created for it. Instead, it wants me to create a new one. Does anyone know how to solve this?  <comment89484> What is the exact error message in failing to register? Did you open a web browser and check your Apple ID at https://appleid.apple.com and click manage on the right and check the password, email, name, etc..?
