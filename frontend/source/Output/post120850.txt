Export reminders from osx Reminders app programmatically <body> I need to get reminders list in any form (could parse it later) from Reminders app in osx (10.9.1)  I know that i could do it from menu, but i need it programmatically.  Perfectly it would be some console command or script. Maybe there is a common way to interact with osx apps visual interface (not so good, but ok). It is needed for personal use.  <answer162806> You can do this with Automator. Open Automator and:  ol liCreate a workflow/li liAdd a “strongFind Calendar Items/strong” action and add it/li liChange the first line from “Find emevents/em where:” to “Find emreminders/em where:”/li liTo grab emall/em the reminders change the “strongAny Content/strong contains strong______/strong” to “strongTitle/strong strongis not/strong strong______/strong“ and leave the text field empty. You may need to change to fit your needs better./li liThen add an “strongEvent Summary/strong” action underneath it./li liFrom here you can use Automator to do whatever you like with the reminders. /li /ol  To help you test it out, use a “strongView Results/strong” action. You can insert it anywhere and it will show you what the output of the prior action was.   hr  For doing this from Terminal:  ol liFind the strong.workflow/strong file you saved and copy the path to it./li liRun codeautomator/code and pass in the path./li liNow you should see the results or errors of running the actions. /li /ol  You will need to run this manually once to enable Terminal to prompt for access to your Reminders.
