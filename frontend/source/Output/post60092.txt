Share External USB from OSX to Windows7 <body> On sharing from Mac to Windows I get access denied.  My setup: 1 - Windows 7/64 bit 6GB  2 - OSX 10.8 - Mac mini 8GB     2TB external USB drive formatted exFat  Both machines are on the same 'workgroup'.   I set up the sharing on the mac.  1. Enabled SMB for all users individually.  2. Tried enabling and disabling AFP with no change in results.  3. 'File Sharing' service is checked off  4. folder from USB was added, and all users were granted 'Read &amp; Write' permissions.  I can see it on the Windows machine through the windows explorer-Network, when I try to access it it get the error box:  \{MY MACHINE}{MY SHARE} is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact he admin... The parameter is incorrect.  If I try to do the Map Network Drive from explorer, and enter different credentials as: {OSX MACHINE}{OSX USER} {OSX PASSWORD}  It will map the drive, but when I click on it to see the contents, I get error box of: Z:\ is not accessible The paramter is incorrect.  This is my first MAC, and was hoping to be able to use this external drive for backing up all my other Windows boxes.   additional info:  1. formatted the drive with the Windows machine  2. just plugged into MAC and told it not to use for TimeMachine  3. when I look at /Volumes/{USB DRIVE}/ it seems that permissions are rwx fro all users/groups.  No idea where to look for any logs to access, or if I need to change mount options.  Note: I have cygwin installed on all my Windows boxes if rsync were the only option, just no clue if I need to do anything else to set that up on the MAC.  <comment69183> Windows needs to be running a lower version of NTLM authentication. <comment69303> Is there a way to lower the version of NTLM auth? Any documentation you can point me to? <comment69335> This might be of service: http://www.nbtnet.newboundary.com/support/docs/ppm/ppm/troubleshooting/tasks/ppm0114.htm
