Resolution problem on external display with Thunderbolt->HDMI adapter <body> Let me explain problem in quick bullets:  What I want: I would like to use ultra wide external display with 3440x1440@50hz resolution with my MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012). I would like to use my Thunderbolt port on mac, and my HDMI 1.4 input on my display.  I can successfully connect my display using: - HDMI - HDMI with 3440x1440@50hz - TB - DP (via TB - DP adapter) with 3440x1440@50hz  I can partially successfully (with limited resolution) connect my display using: - TB - HDMI (via TB - HDMI adpater) with 1920x1080@60hz (max)  Question is: Is it matter of my adapter? For me it seems like it doesn't support HDMI 1.4, but only lower standard. (I have no idea how to check adapter type/support. There was no information about that on the product box). Or maybe that is basically not possible to convert signal properly with TB/DP - HDMI adapter?  Please advise. Thanks, Tomasz  P.S. I have MacBook Pro Retina (Mid 2012), GeForce GT 650M 1024MB, OS X El Capitan (10.11.3).  <comment281581> Can you tell us what adapter you have? It's probable it's an older revision of HDMI that doesn't support the resolution at that refresh rate. <comment281945> As I said I am not sure, as there is no information about specifics on the product box.  It's actually part of my question, is the adapter important? - does adapter also "follow" standards? (can be 1.4, 1.3 etc). I wasn't sure if it's only matter of output/input (laptop/display) or also cable/adapter itself. <comment282068> Yes, the adapter can certainly be part of the problem. Can you post the box/brand/model if nothing else?
