Is there a way to limit how frequently you can start an application? <body> On my phone, I'm am enjoying a new tweak called MailStop which sole purpose is to limit my reflex of checking my mail far too often. I have set it to not allow me to start the Mail app for five hours once I have already started it. This has had a great impact on my mail checking abuse. I get to stop and remember I'm checking it far too often every time I try to open it during these hours.  There are other ways to limit the Mail app abuse with this application, but my question os the same as the title: Is there a way to limit how frequently you can start an application on the mac?  <answer82899> Yes, it's call Willpower 1.0. :-)  Seriously, the only thing I can think of is Parental Controls, which can limit certain actions by time of day, but I don't think that's what you want. There are probably other apps designed to limit kids' activity on Macs that might have finer-grained controls.  <answer82905> It would be pretty easy for someone to write a utility control app use in OS X, and it looks like someone already has. Have a look at Mac App Blocker. It has per-app granularity and restriction-by-schedule. It doesn't currently have the ability to limit an app to X launches per-hour / per-day.  I emailed this feature request to the developer:  precodeFeb. 20, 2013 Can you add the ability to limit an application to launching  x number of  times per hour, per day, or per week?  And, related, to limit an app to  launching *no more than* once every x hours, days, or weeks? /code/pre  Got this reply:  precodeFeb. 21, 2013 I have had a few other requests along the same lines. Perhaps it would be  a good idea to add this kind of functionality. As Mac App Blocker has  progressed over the past year, it has become more feature rich and,  possibly a little more complicated. As it is, we're trying to fulfill  more requests while keeping the app simple to use. I like your idea and I  would like to add something to MAB for these types of options. I will definitely add this to our growing list of feature requests. Hopefully, we'll get this added in a (near) future release.

Is there a way to limit it to launching no more than once every _n_ hours, under Mac OS X?" <comment95765> But they could always get a different input device, go to another building, or, if handcuffed, operate an iPad with their face. Only *real* solution: delete the MX records from his mail host's DNS configuration. <comment95779> Is this your original work? I thought I saw this script posted in the answer to another similiar question. <comment95837> Yes, my work. Of course some parts can be found elsewhere like how to hide an applescript app from dock or how to detect if an application is running. But I've written this code to answer your question. <comment95994> gosmondâ€¦ does it rly matter? <comment115706> I have stayed in contact with Ken and it seems to be in the latest version.
