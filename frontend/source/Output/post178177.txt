iPhone LED / Flash light on charging? <body> I just recently bought an iphone this year, and need to know if it has any led flash light for letting my know that it's charging?  I have iPhone 5c, and it's got this setting for light for call and message alerts. I'm trying to look for a similar setting for when it's in charging mode.  Please could someone provide any help regarding this?  <answer178183> Sadly there is no led light for when it is charging it only vibrates/shows a picture of a battery  <answer178244> Best you can do is to tap the Home button.    Green Battery level, top right, &amp; briefly a charge percentage under the current time are your easiest indicators.  When you first plug it in a double-buzz or a em'mim'/em sound is your clue it recognised the charger &amp; is now charging.  <comment211045> Ok. Thanks! I thought there might be some app allowing this feature, maybe it's not supported even via apps...?
