How to set reply-to address in Apple Mail <body> I have two accounts set up in Apple Mail. The second account is for backup purposes and because at times the primary account is unavailable. When that happens, I send from the second account but would like the reply-to address to be that of the primary account. Is there a way to set things up this way in Apple Mail?  <answer60981> Simple!

You can set the e-mail address in Mail.app Preferences  Accounts for each account individually.  <answer194734> If you go to settings, then mail then account, under IMAP information it says Email, click on the arrow on right, then choose add account and enter the email address of the account you want reply sent from and hit RETURNABLE it will add the account then you must click on that account to select it.
