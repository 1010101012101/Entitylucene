Which of iOS apps allow customizing font size? <body> Which of iOS apps that allow customizing font sizes:  ul lieither through support of DynamicType / LargerText system settings (and BoldText that can be helpful to improve readability)/li lior have their own settings for font size--and how broad is the size range available?/li /ul  One of the goals for such a list is to help understanding how font sizes can change when switching between devices with different DPI and resolution--given current variety: iPad Mini/Air, iPhone 6/6+, earlier iPhones.  Ideally I'd be happy to compare screenshots, but doubtful how it can be achieved here at SE with reasonable efforts.  <answer163579> (please contribute to the list with any other apps, and feel free to edit to make the list more accurate--this is a community wiki answer)  hr  Notation for the list below:  ol liWith few exceptions, any app falls into on of these categories:  ul liit supports System Settings  Dynamic Type and Bold Text (I mark it as strong"Dynamic&amp;Bold"/strong below)/li liOR also supports System Settings  Larger Text (I mark as strong"Larger Text"/strong)/li liOR has its own app-specific font size settings (strong"App settings"/strong)/li liOR has NO font size customization whatsoever (strong"No customization"/strong)/li /ul/li liFor each app, I also specify how its maximum text size compares to standard system apps at maximum Dynamic Type setting if different (the app font is strongSmaller/strong or strongLarger/strong than in system apps)--to make it easier for a given app to understand its text size limit, given only few minutes with built-in apps only at Apple outlet./li /ol  hr  h1Social networks/h1  strongFacebook/strong: br  - all UGC (News Feed, User Timeline, Individual post and comments): Dynamic&amp;Bold (since 2015-Nov-06) br  - app interfaces: No customization; smaller  strongTwitter/strong: br  - timeline: App settings (3 sizes); smaller br  - settings screen: Dynamic&amp;Bold  strongGoogle+/strong: No customization; Much smaller  strongInstagram/strong: No customization; Much smaller  strongVKontakte/strong (both iPad- and iPhone apps): No customization; Smaller  hr  h1Email apps/h1  strongMail/strong: br  - plaintext emails: Dynamic&amp;Bold br  - HTML emails: font scales only with Larger Text, but not with Dynamic Type(!); but can be much smaller than for plain text emails / than in other apps  strongGMail/strong:  No customization; Smaller (both for plaintext and HTML emails)  strongGoogle Inbox/strong:  No customization; Smaller (both for plaintext and HTML emails)  strongCalendar/strong (by Apple): Dynamic&amp;Bold  hr  h1Task managers/h1  strongOmniFocus/strong:br - Dynamic&amp;Bold throughout the appbr - LargerText for leaf-level outline items and Note editing only; No for outline groups  strongThings/strong: No customization; smaller  hr  h1Instant Messengers/h1  strongMessages/strong (iMessage):br - history of chat with a contact: LargerTextbr - list of contacts on left sidebar: Dynamic&amp;Bold  strongSkype/strong: No customization; Much Smaller  strongTelegram/strong:br - history of chat with a contact: Dynamic Type (no Bold Text); smallerbr - list of chats: No customization; Smaller  hr  h1Web browsers/h1  strongSafari/strong:br - regular browsing: No customizaion; pinch to zoom leads to horizontal scrolling.

However, you have to jailbreak your device to use them.  Just bringing this up as an alternative.  <comment191572> Posted this after [discussion at meta](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2315/listing-ios-apps-supporting-dynamictype-ok-how). Will populate with the details on dozen or two that I collected myself.
