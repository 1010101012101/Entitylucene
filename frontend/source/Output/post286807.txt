How do I stop emails 'pushing' to Apple Mail (macOS Sierra) <body> I don't want Mail to automatically download new mail. I want to manually do this by choosing Mailbox  Get All New Mail.  I have tried setting the preference 'Check for new messages: Manually' in Preferences  General, thinking this would solve the issue. But email still pushes to my iCloud account!  Does anyone know how to change this behaviour so new mail only delivers when I ask the app to fetch it?  Thanks!
