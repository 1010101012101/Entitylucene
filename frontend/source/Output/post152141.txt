changes to .bash_profile causing Terminal shell to not load but keep looping with PATH settings <body> I was trying to make some changes with PATH (mostly add a new PATH) to my .bash_profile and the last line entered was codesource .bash_profile/code.  After I saved and restarted the Terminal app, instead of the shell prompt I see PATH values continuously popping up on my Terminal window tab. Only CTRL+C will kill it but now I see 'Application Closed' message and that's the end of it. What do I do to restore the shell back to my previous status? I tried running the repair permissions under Disk Utility but that didn't seem to fix my issue.  Thanks in advance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OuwGf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer152142> You should remove the line:  precodesource .bash_profile /code/pre  from your .bash_profile. This line is causing the infinite loop by continuously loading the file. As you have discovered, repairing permissions will not solve this issue.  Since you can't access terminal, you can edit your .bash _profile in TextEdit. Here's how to do so:  ol liOpen TextEdit Application and select Open (under File)./li liNavigate to your home folder./li li.bash_profile will not be shown by default, since it begins with a period and is hidden. Type codeCmd-Shift-./code to view all hidden files./li liThen, open up your .bash_profile and remove the codesource .bash_profile/code line./li /ol  <comment179443> You can create a new terminal with shell customizations disabled using **Shell  New Commandâ€¦** to run the command `bash --noprofile`. Then you can edit your shell startup script(s) using your usual tty-based editor.
