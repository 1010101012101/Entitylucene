TextEditor with Overview of Search Tool's Result? <body> I am trying to find a texteditor which can give an overview of Search Tool's Result. I find the current situation of TextMate problematic  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ElgBz.png" alt="enter image description here"  You cannot see the section of one search result without losing your position in the document. The current one-line overview is not enough.  Therefore, I have to look some other editor, since the search tool is an essential tool in studying.   I am also open for Linux editors because I can compile them for OS X if necessary.   hr  Is there any TextEditor with Overview of Search Tool's Result?  <answer239652> The engineer responded very fast and submitted a change in the Textmate 2 beta 9. It solves the problem. Now, clicking the find-window, the location of the document is also changed correspondingly.   <comment294175> Problem solved. The engineer submitted an improvement in the editor.
