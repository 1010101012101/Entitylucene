Do I need to know someone's Apple ID email address to gift them an app? <body> I'd like to send an app from the App Store to somebody as a gift. I have their email address, but I'm not sure if it's the email address associated with their Apple ID.   Do I need to enter their strongspecific Apple ID email address/strong, or will they be able to download the gift app if the email gets sent to strongany of their email addresses/strong?   <answer32603> I believe the email sent contains a link with a promo code, it's not bound to the email address.  So you can send it to whatever, they'll still be able to get the app gifted.  <comment37310> I confirmed this by gifting myself an app to the wrong email address. No problems encountered.
