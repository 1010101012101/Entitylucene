iPod Nano keeps going/staying in recovery mode <body> Configuration:br Windows XP Pro + SP3br iPod Nano 1st generation, firmware version 1.3.1br iTunes 10.4.1.10  hr  When I connect the iPod to the PC iTunes says       iTunes has detected an iPod in recovery mode. You must restorebr   this iPod before it can be used with iTunes     OK, that's what I do. I get a message that       Your iPod has been restored to factory setting, and isbr   restarting. Please leave your iPod connected. It willbr   appear in the iTunes window after it restarts.   Then on the iPod the Apple logo appears for a few minutes, which then switches to a "Do not disconnect" message. Again after some time the recovery mode reappears in iTunes. I've cycled through this a few times, even on a different USB port, but no avail. If I disconnect the iPod I can walk through the menus, and reset it. The music of course has gone.    Is there a way to get the iPod out of recovery mode, other than with the iTunes function?  <answer26397> I looked a bit further in it and I found the solution here. It appears the drive letter assigned to the iPod conflicted with another drive. Assigning a free drive letter as on the Apple support page solved the problem.  <answer26398> It may be a drive letter conflict in Windows. Go ahead and try the steps listed here: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1493#changedrive  <comment30149> That's exactly it. I found it out myself as well, but this is the right answer, so you get the votes
