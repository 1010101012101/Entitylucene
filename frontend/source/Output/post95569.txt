How can I produce a high quality, spectrum-colored waveform from a music file? <body> Most DJ software commonly provides an ever present waveform of the full song in reasonable quality. Only in a few apps is the waveform actually colorized with a spectrum.  For example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mnYeJ.png" alt="Full song waveform preview from Serato DJ"  Serato DJ can give me a full song overview suitable for examining at a glance.  But it's incredibly small, and the compression and artifacting that occurs when you increase the size for presentation and other mediums is a bit disgusting.  Via this software, I can also get a very large version of the wave form, approximately 0.5% of the song at a time:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/edYNP.png" alt="Granular waveform in Serato DJ"  But to screenshot and stitch out an entire song would be difficult to say the least. To do it for 3 difference songs, or more, would be antagonizing.  Is there software already present to create and render scalable, full song waveforms?  <comment112101> In case anyone is curious about the spectrum coloring. Given a 3 band EQ (highs, mids, lows). Red = Low (kicks, deep bass), Green = Mids (synths, most vocals), Blue = Highs (lead synths, cymbal/crashes, shimmering audio effects). A mixture of these creates a logical color combination. Purple = Low+High, etc. <comment112102> http://artistx.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/freecycle.png or http://www.algoriddim.com/djay-mac <comment112103> Do you have Win 7 ? if yes look at this http://www.goldwave.com/release.php
