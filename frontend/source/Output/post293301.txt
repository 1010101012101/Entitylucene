Location of Account/ Login picture on Mac OS X 10.12 Sierra <body> I used this solution -   precodesudo dscl . -read /Users/$USER JPEGPhoto | tail -1 | xxd -r -p &gt; ~/Desktop/$USER.jpg /code/pre  Is there any other better way to physically locate this picture?  <answer293311> You can use 3rd party app EasyFind. This app allows you to chose which directory structure to search for a given file. If you know file name or at least extension you can search either a Library folder or the system folder. EasyFind does a relatively quick search compared to Spotlight.
