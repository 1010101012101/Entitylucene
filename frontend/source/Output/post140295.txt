Resetting application window size <body> I would like to know how to reset a user set window size for an application to the one chosen by the developer. Are these settings usually stored in some plist file?   <answer140299> It depends on the Application, but mostly it's stored in the codedefaults/code database. You can check for example strongMail.app/strong with:  precodedefaults read com.apple.mail DefaultWindowState /code/pre  If You do not know the codekey/code just grep with "window" the output from codedefaults read BUNDLE_ID/code where codeBUNDLE_ID/code is Your application bundle identifier which can be read like this:  precodeAPP_PATH="/Applications/Mail.app" defaults read "$APP_PATH/Contents/Info.plist" CFBundleIdentifier /code/pre  You can try to change keys in plists using codedefaults/code command or locate plist file in code~/Library/Preferences/code directory and change it manually.  <comment301153> May I ask what you mean by"You can try to change keys in plists using defaults command or locate plist file in ~/Library/Preferences directory and change it manually".... Should I pass default in the string area of the plist for resetting to the default size or? <comment301245> @Caspert I think You can just delete the key with `defaults delete BUNDLE KEY`
