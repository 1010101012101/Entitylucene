List apps with access to your Apple ID <body> Since you can now login to certain OSX/iOS apps using your Apple ID credentials rather than with an application-specific account, is there a way to list all of the apps you have granted access to and edit their permissions (something like what Google does when you authenticate using your Google credentials)?  <answer262283> I am not sure if it is the same thing. But there is a 'Manage apps that can look you up' section in the advanced settings on iCloud.com. Here you have a support article about it.   Could not find anything else in iCloud that comes close. However it is a great feature request! You can give feedback about this to Apple.  <comment305151> To which applications/apps do you log in using your Apple ID? Can you list some examples? <comment305153> @patrix Day One 2 would be an example: https://dayone.me/user/login And that's actually the only one I can think of right now :D <comment305166> If I understand this correctly, Day One uses the Apple ID for authentication only and there are no access rights to anything in your account involved in that (kind of like OpenID). But let's see whether somebody has a more thorough and fact-based explanation for this. <comment328568> I don't think this is quite the same thing, to me this feature sounds like if another user is using the same app as you, they can look you up from the app using your Apple ID. <comment328569> The question is, are you logged in with your Apple ID in that app. If they can look you up.. you given your Apple ID someway... <comment328570> The point is, you can revoke the permission to look you up in that setting section you linked to, but you could still be logging in to the app with your Apple ID, so I think the two are not the same thing. I really think that the option to see all places where you are using your Apple ID to login to something is missing at the moment. <comment328571> In this setting you can only hide yourself from others finding you in apps that are using your Apple ID. I agree it is not the same thing and this function is missing at the moment. I highly recommend you to send Apple a feature request through the feedback form.
