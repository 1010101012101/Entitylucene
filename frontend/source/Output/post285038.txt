Outlook on OS X - Accept appointments to another calendar? <body> I have a client with several assistants that receive meeting invites for their executives.  They are using Macs running Yosemite, El Capitan and Sierra with iCal and Apple Mail on hosted Exchange.  We are looking to convert them to Outlook, replace ancient Office 2008 and upgrade them all to Sierra.  Currently they use iCloud calendars and the execs all subscribe to the assistant's iCloud account.  Each has their own calendar under the assistant, but when one exec has a reminder, they all see it and it can be confusing.  Additionally, when they were on POP/IMAP, when receiving an invitation, they could accept it and it would remain in their inbox (or so I'm told).  With their iCloud calendar, when an assistant accepts an appointment sent to her, she can choose which of her iCloud calendars it will appear on.  If I add Exchange calendar, they experience odd behavior - Although the iCloud calendar is default, the appointments still go to their Exchange calendar.  So it's going to be all or nothing, no transition.  I can add the assistant as a delegate, but they cannot accept an appointment on behalf of their exec from her own inbox.  She would have to send the appointment to the exec, then go into the exec's inbox and accept it which is clumsy.  So, if the assistant accepts something, perhaps she can forward it and we can do this with a rule to auto-accept anything from specific people: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/sharepoint_republic/2011/12/09/outlook-rule-to-auto-accept-or-auto-decline-meeting-invites/ I don't know if scripting is possible on OS X though.  Since Outlook (maybe it's addressed in 2016) on OS X cannot be set to retain accepted invites, this might work: Prevent Outlook meeting requests from auto-deleting  Any insight or recommendations are greatly appreciated!  <comment359868> As there are no responses, is there another location to cross post this to? Thanks!
