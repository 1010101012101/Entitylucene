If you replaced memory to maximize, try installing the original Apple memory according to the instructions available at:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1270  If you haven't replaced any memory, you may still be able to solve the problem yourself by using the instructions available at the location above to try your existing memory modules one at a time. If the problem goes away when either of the modules is in use by itself, you can probably assume the other one is bad, and you can then shop for a replacement or upgrade.  <comment206124> nothing to worry about, it is the stupid Calendar Agent doing it :) <comment206125> @Buscar웃 what should I do? I am really desperate , how to solve it ? it is keep randomly restarting , freezing etc <comment206127> Open the Console in your Utility folder and copy some 30-50 lines here so we can have a look. It wont hurt I promise (said the Dentist to me) <comment206128> Your AppleHardwareTest shows 2002D, which indicates you had a USB device connected. Disconnect all external and re-run the AHT test. <comment206129> @Buscar웃  I pasted the console info above. Not unfortunately, I did not have any USB or any external stuff , I checked it 10 times :-( <comment206130> Ok got it, are you trying to install Mavericks ? Also I would recommend to use disk Utility to repair the permissions and to cehck the disk. <comment206131> @Buscar웃 since you said it is the problem of Calendar agent, I disable it permenetly by http://superuser.com/questions/490056/how-can-i-disable-the-calendar-agent-from-running-on-mac-os-x-lion <comment206132> @Buscar웃 actually I just wanted to downgrade to Mavericks because I don't know why it keeps restarting or freezing  , I have done the disk utility , repair but it did not help at all <comment206134> OK, that would explain the Mavericks stuff in the log, and you can not do that. What is interesting is the Disk Utility logs, so I need to look up. Meanwhile does it stay solid (without restarts) if you run in Safe mode. It looks like it is to messed up now, so using the cmd+r to restore the Yosemite installation, then we will see further. <comment206138> Buscar웃 OK, I will restart and keep the cmd+r , then I will come back here <comment206165> thanks, I cleaned installed Mavericks! now I will see whether it keeps restarting or not, If yes, I'll take it to apple shop! THNAKS <comment206298> I think Trellis is likely right, you have some bad RAM. Hopefully it's not the system board and just the RAM. Note that some OS versions are pickier about hardware, so what works with Mavericks, might not with yosemite. Strange but true... <comment206514> Those hardware test errors are fairly cryptic, and the RAM is generally the only thing you can test readily because duplication is commonly built in.
