MacBook Pro 15" late 2011 stuck on white screen with Apple logo and mouse <body> When I turn on my MacBook Pro 15" late 2011 laptop, the computer appears to boot up normally. The Apple logo appears with the white screen, but the progress bar stops at approximately 80 percent. At this time, the mouse is visible and the laptop makes "invalid" sounds when I press kbdCommand/kbdkbdQ/kbd or kbdShift/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdQ/kbd.  I have tried:  ul liResetting SMC and NVRAM/li liReplacing SSD with HDD/li liReplacing RAM/li liBooting to Safe Mode: Apple logo appears and progress bar indicates 80 percent, but without the mouse pointer./li liReinstalling OS X from another computer/li liInstalling OS X on USB flash drive and using Carbon Copy Cloner to clone to the HDD of the troublesome laptop/li liBooting off battery power and booting off power adapter, no difference/li /ul  Is there another method I can try to somehow revive this machine?  <comment361678> Try booting in Verbose Mode - Hold `Cmd-V` while powering on - release when you hear the chime.  You may need to have your phone recording so it can capture any messages, but most importantly, pay attention to where it stops.
