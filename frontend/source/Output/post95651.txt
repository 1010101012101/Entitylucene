Mac 10.7.3 Web Sharing Won't Start <body> When I turn it on it says "starting" for a split second and then turns back off. I reinstalled Lion and it still happens. Trying to start it from the command line:  precodecade:~&gt; sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons /org.apache.httpd.plist org.apache.httpd: Already loaded /code/pre  Okay... But...  precodecade:~&gt; ps aux | grep apache cade            1137   0.0  0.0  2434892    540 s000  S+    2:32AM   0:00.00 grep apache /code/pre  I replaced httpd.conf with the default one, and that didn't help either. Any ideas? Thanks.  <comment112241> The process for web sharing is called httpd, not apache. <comment112272> Wouldn't it still show up because apache is in the name of the launch daemon? Anyway, I still get the same results. <comment112426> Have you triedâ€¦ sudo apachectl start <comment112596> `cade:~ sudo apachectl start` `org.apache.httpd: Already loaded`
