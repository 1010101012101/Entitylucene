Run command line tools as separate app <body> Is there a way to run command line tools as a separate app, so I can easily switch between them with apple+tab etc? I want this for things like a mail and irc client where I don't want to hunt down the terminal window to access them. Something like http://www.fluidapp.com but for the terminal.  <answer225343> You can open separate instance of strongTerminal.app/strong with  precode/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal &amp; /code/pre  You'll have separate icon on the Dock also. However You'll not be able to distinguish them in kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⇥ tab/kbd because they are going to be called simply "Terminal" and have the same icons.  <answer225359> appify seems to be what you're looking for…  <comment273623> Unfortunately the inability to change the icon and that you can't give a script or command or anything to the new Terminal rules this out. <comment273624> This is definitely something interesting, but I didn't find a way to open a terminal window with it yet.
