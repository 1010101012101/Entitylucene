Can't print to Savin printer <body> I have a MacBook Pro late 2013 model. I have a large enterprise Savin C9065 printer that I could print to. Strangely, when I go to print something now it says, 'filter' failed. I am using an OpenPrint driver for the printer it says it is version 20. When I try to use the official Savin printer driver which is version 4.0 and I print something it sends out hundreds of blank pages. So I had to use this community driver for it to work properly.  I am using OS X Mavericks 10.9.2. I am not sure what happened since it was working fine last week. I tried restarting the printer, trying a different driver, and rebooting the computer but none have worked.  <comment251040> Can you activate the CUPS web interface and tell us what it says about your printer?  Type `cupsctl WebInterface=yes` at a Terminal prompt; then go to the URL `http://localhost:631` in any browser, navigate to your printer via the Printers menu in the upper right corner, and see what CUPS tells you.  From here you should be able to print a test page as well (or if the test page comes out wrong, that usually tells you the wrong driver is installed.)
