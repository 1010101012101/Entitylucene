Spotlight shortcut not working within an app(s) anymore <body> I love the spotlights kbdcmd/kbd + kbdspace/kbd functionality to start apps. Half of the time now the spotlight isn't working for me. I'm on 10.9.2 if that matters.  Say I'm in Chrome and want to open Word, for example. I hit cmd+space and... Chrome scrolls one page down. This is not just Chrome issue, if I'm using Wunderlist for example (another app) kbdcmd/kbd + kbdspace/kbd doesn't do anything. I have to hit it 3-4 times to get spotlight open.  How can I get kbdcmd/kbd + kbdspace/kbd functionality back? Its super quick way to launch apps and I miss it.  EDIT: Is there a quicker way to open an app with keyboard shortcuts? I'm slowly giving up on the spotlight. :(  <answer126432> On my MBA 10.9.2 I use the System Preferences Spotlight and Check off the 2 boxes for shortcuts.  <comment148044> I could newer start word using cmd+space. I can start spotlight with it, <comment148049> @Buscarì›ƒ cmd+space, start typing "word" until the application is the top hit, hit enter. <comment148052> As Isaid, that works here, make sure you have it enabled in Spotlight preferances <comment148053> @Buscar not only can you enter 'word' to start an app, spotlight will learn and eventually you can type open word in a few seconds by space+cmd+w ... that's right eventually you will be able to type w and it will work fine. Its great when it works, now it doesn't work half of the time :( which is very frustrating. <comment148197> That disables spotlight completely. I'm trying to get spotlight working from within the apps like Chrome. Right now when I space+cmd in Chrome I get page-down. This is the problem -- I need spotlight working as it did before.
