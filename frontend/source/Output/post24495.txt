What breaks if I delete the folders named Public and Sites? <body> The default home folder on Mac OS X has folders named strongPublic/strong and strongSites/strong.  I never use them, so what will possibly break if I delete them?  <answer24496> Nothing unless you use Web Sharing, and it'll just moan at you if you switch that on.   <answer24507> As an alternative to deleting them, you could consider hiding them in the Finder instead. To do this, launch Terminal then enter this command:  precodechflags hidden ~/Public ~/Sites /code/pre  If you ever want to make them visible again, you would use this command:  precodechflags nohidden ~/Public ~/Sites /code/pre  <comment27503> This is a better solution. And you'll notice that if you try to delete them, Lion now bars you from the action. If you just don't want to see them in Finder, hide them as opposed to delete them. <comment27515> Actually I made them hidden a while ago already. These folders are bothering me in terminal.
