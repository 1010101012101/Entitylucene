Propagate permissions to subfolders and subfiles <body> I know that using codesudo chmod 777 /folder/code will set a particular permission to /folder, but it will not do the same with subfolders and subfiles inside the folder.   Is there a terminal command to propagate permissions inside the folder?  <answer190218> You have to use code-R/code option to make the command recursive:  precodesudo chmod -R 777 /folder /code/pre  <comment225743> That will also change permissions of every file within folder and its sub-folders. The method to only change permissions on the folder and its sub-folders would be `find folder -type d -exec chmod 777 {} +` <comment225744> Seems that is what the OP wants... Read carefully: "with subfolders and subfiles inside the folder". <comment225745> Yep, I need to read more carefully though it is not a good idea to set the executable bit on a regular file. <comment225749> Read: `man chmod` <comment225773> Thanks for your help and suggestions :)
