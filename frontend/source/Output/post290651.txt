tar is giving a symbol error in a bash install script? <body> I've been trying to install meteor and as part of the install process it downloads node from a tar file which it pipes to tar. But the tar extract command is erroring out with a missing symbol?  I used homebrew to codebrew install gnu-tar --with-default-names/code   precodeNODE_URL="https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.1.3/node-v8.1.3-darwin-x64.tar.gz"  curl "${NODE_URL}" | tar zx --strip-components 1  /code/pre  Will return this:  precodelazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _utimensat    Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/tar     Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib  dyld: Symbol not found:  _utimensat    Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/tar    Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib /code/pre  <answer290652> In your example you are using bsd/macos curl with gnu tar, that won't work. Unfortunately many dev programs rely on the apple bash and trying to upgrade things to gnu can break bash scripts.  brew won't even let you install curl "natively"  precodebrew install curl ==&gt; Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/curl-7.54.1.sierra.bottle.tar.gz ==&gt; Caveats This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local, because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in parallel can cause all kinds of trouble. /code/pre  to fix your problem with the bash script you'll want to rename gnu-tar from tar to gtar, the following will do the trick  precodebrew uninstall gnu-tar brew install gnu-tar /code/pre
