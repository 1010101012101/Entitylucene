Credit card readers for iPhone - Can I use it as another input device? <body> I need a credit card reader for an app I'm developing. Since this site is more about the hardware than the developer side, I'm looking for a hardware piece that I can buy that reads credit cards. Most of the CC readers I see on iTunes or amazon come with an app that can read them: Square, Credit Card Terminal, Mobile Smartphone Magstripe Reader  Are there magnetic card readers that work with iOS that consumers / makers can experiment with?  <comment59771> Duplicate: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4674197/is-there-a-credit-card-reader-for-the-iphone-that-has-its-own-api <comment70251> I've edited this to be on-topic here. If the OP needs API support or to know how well a piece of hardware works from a developer standpoint then Stack Overflow is the place for that. Asking about hardware compatibility is fine for this site even if it's a developer that wants to know :-)
