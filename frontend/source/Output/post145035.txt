Macbook Pro 15 progression bar halts then circle spins <body> We have a Macbook Pro 15 Last 2011. The computer starts to boot, it shows the progression bar, then it disappears and the circle just spins.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3kil.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have tried safe mode and it just spins.  I just ran the hardware test and it returned no problems - I am trying to boot into safemode now  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wDgHx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This screen has been running for 15 minutes now - Eventually the grey bar disappears and it just spins  EDIT:: I booted in startup mode and chose the disk utility - It said the HD was fine :(  EDIT:: I am able to boot from a external thunderbolt drive  Ran in verbose mode. Last couple of lines after rebuilding b-tree:  precodeThe volume Macintosh HD could not be repaired  launch_msg(): Socket is not connected /code/pre  <answer145047> If you are able to boot from external drive, then your boot sector has a problem (obviously).  Using the cmd+v will boot in Verbose mode if you care to investigate where it hangs up.  Using the cmd+r and restoring os is the best option here.  <comment170854> Have you the Hardware Diagnostics? Press D during startup.... http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US <comment170860> @JBRWilkinson - Yes I ran the test - no problems - I am running safemode now <comment170866> Start in Verbose mode (line by line) to see where it hangs up. (Option+v) <comment170868> @Buscar웃 Rebuilding catalog B-tree <comment170869> @Buscar It's not ⌥V, it's ⌘V for Verbose boot
