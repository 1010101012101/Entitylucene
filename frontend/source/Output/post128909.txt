How to burn a dvd on 10.8 <body> I have a strong.mp4/strong-file I want to burn to a DVD to then watch on a dvd player and have automatically loop infinitely (can you program that into the dvd or is it to do with the dvd player?)  What would you reccomend I do?  <answer128912> Use Burn. It will convert your MP4 into a MPG and write it to the DVD as playable. (And yes, you can make the DVD loop automatically. See below.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GkCJa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment150940> Thank you. That is an old version of Burn I believe. My one looks different! <comment333535> Possible duplicate of [How to burn a .mp4 to DVD+R](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128597/how-to-burn-a-mp4-to-dvdr)
