Updating to OS X 10.10.2 broke Quick Look previews for HTML files <body> After updating to OS X 10.10.2, I can no longer use Quick Look on HTML files – I just get a blank preview window, and the issue persists through a reboot. But all other files types work fine.  Is there a cache I can clear or something else I can try to get this working again?  <answer173562> You can clear the quicklook cache by entering this in terminal:  ul licodeqlmanage -r/code/li licodeqlmanage -r cache/code/li /ul  I have the same problem after updating, but clearing cache doesn't seem to help.  <answer174079> Known bug on Apple's Bug Radar as Bug # 19639311  10.10.2 quick look broken for HTML files  codeqlmanage -t &lt;path_to_html_file&gt;/code produces a small thumbnail of the HMTL filebr codeqlmanage -p &lt;path_to_html_file&gt;/code just gives me a blank quicklook preview  This doesn't happen with a .jpg file I used as a control sample.  <comment202547> I have the same problem and reported it to Apple as a bug. <comment205166> I submitted a bug report a few days ago and they just closed it as a duplicate of the same issue. Hopefully there's enough duplicates that they'll fix it in the next release. <comment207394> This is also affecting SVG files, since they use the same webkit renderer as html files.
