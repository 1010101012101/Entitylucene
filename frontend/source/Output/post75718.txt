Restore deleted Mac App Store on 10.8.2 <body> I accidentally deleted system apps like the codeApp Store.app/code and the codeCalendar.app/code.  How can I restore these? I've tried the combo update like suggested for 10.6.6 systems, but that unfortunately doesn't seem to work on 10.8.  <answer75721> Boot to recovery HD and reinstall Mountain Lion if you don't have those backed up to your Time Machine (or equivalent) backup.   <comment87897> I hoped not having to reinstall <comment87898> Backups help not having to reinstall when you delete things - you could see about copying those apps from another similar OS install or hope the 10.8.3 combo update has those apps in their entirety. <comment87899> Yes I just thought of that. I actually have a mini server running 10.8.2 as well, so I'll try just copying it over from there. <comment87900> Consider backing things up just in case calendar barfs. I can't see it being risky, but you never know.... <comment87901> I usually have a TM backup but this time I just wiped the Time Capsule moments before that to run a completely fresh backup... so bad timing. <comment181659> How did you do that?
