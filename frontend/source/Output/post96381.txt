How can I stop Firefox from always floating on top in Parallels 7 with Windows 7? <body> I've got set up with Parallels 7 running Windows 7, and I'm finding that Firefox is forever sitting in front of all my other windows.  I'm unable to even tab to them, I have to actually move Firefox to the side or minimise it.  Other programs I'm usually running - Visual Studio Express for Web 2012, SSMS 2008 Express.  In poking at this, It seems that if I go to normal full screen then back to coherence, it works, but I've not noted what triggers Firefox floating to the top.  Any ideas?  It's a hassle, and it's not a good look when I'm at a Windows machine workplace with a boss who isn't the biggest fan of Macs.
