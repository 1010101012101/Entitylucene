Running terminal commands on startup/login <body> How can I run terminal commands on startup or login? On FreeBSD I believe you can do this using rc.d - is there an equivalent for the Mac? I know how to set up Login Items, but these only work for GUI applications, and there must be an elegant way to make terminal commands run without wrapping them in a GUI executable? As clarified below, I sometimes need to sudo these commands.  <answer34260> Use strongApple Script/strong.  The script would be like this:     codedo shell script "cd ~/Documents"/code   Create an application that uses this script. This application can be added to the login items. I've explained in detail how to do this here.  strongExecuting commands in Apple Script as admin/strong  Password prompt at runtime:     codedo shell script "rm -rf ~/Documents/Gorleben" with administrator privileges/code   Password saved within the script:     codedo shell script "rm -rf ~/Documents/Gorleben" with administrator privileges password "123456"/code   <answer34267> OSX uses launchd to start Unix scripts and executables at boot or login.  New tasks are added via launchctl to update a plist  An easier way of doing this is to use the app Lingon now available on the Mac App Store or LaunchControl  <comment39096> I'll definitely take a look at Lingon! <comment39098> possible duplicate of [How can I run/stop/relaunch an application automatically, at boot/login/some other time?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-can-i-run-stop-relaunch-an-application-automatically-at-boot-login-some-oth) <comment39185> Thanks, but I need to 'sudo' my command - presumably there's no way to do that with AppleScript as I'd need to enter my password after the command? <comment39186> Thanks, how would I go about adding a command starting 'sudo' via launchctl (given I'd need to supply my sudo password)? <comment39187> @tog22 in the plist see the key UserName to say which user the command should run as <comment39188> This can be done by adding ``with administrator privileges password "123456"`` at the end of the command. If you don't want to save the password in the script, just write ``with administrator privileges``. Then you'll be prompted for a password at runtime. I'll edit my answer. <comment70529> Not really a duplicate, as it's specific to terminal commands, covering how to sudo them, etc. <comment70537> This question is "How can I run terminal commands on startup or login? " as is the other and where is sudo in either question? <comment70643> You can run launchd services as root by saving them to `/Library/`.
