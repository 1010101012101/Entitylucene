Add existing Windows installation to Bootcamp <body> I have an SSD with an existing Windows 7 installation that I want to add to my Mac Pro using BootCamp.  Is that possible using the assistant?  <comment248883> I assume you are adding the SSD to the Mac Pro as a second drive and Windows 7 was installed when the SSD was in a different machine? <comment248886> exactly, @DavidAnderson <comment248888> Yes it can be on the second disk and still boot. The problem is the wrong drivers are installed. You probably should have run `sysprep` before removing from the previous computer. Also, there is the question of the type of partitioning/booting: GPT/EFI or MBR/BIOS. You may have to edit the partition tables in order to boot the disk. Of course, there is the idea of putting the disk in and seeing what happens. <comment248889> Another thought. If windows 7 was activated on the previous machine, you could install the disk and try a clean install of Windows 10 before booting.
