Apple password verification showing weird characters <body> I recently had to reload Yosemite on my Macbook Pro Retina (Mid 2014) and after booting it up this morning and allowing a application to run, my password box looks like this.  Any help would be appreciated.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2TzCE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer229464> That looks like font corruption. I'd run the "standard toolkit"  ul liFix permissions, Verify &amp; if necessary Repair disk, using Disk Utility./li liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLs using OnyX  - Maintenance tab/permissions, tick the box at the top then Execute./li liUpdate to [or re-apply if already up to date] 10.10.5 using the 10.10.5 combo update, not the delta from App Store./li /ul  <answer229482> The Font Database is corrupted, you can rebuild it. (NOTE: make backup before performing this)  precodesudo atsutil databases -remove /code/pre  And then repair permissions:  precodesudo diskutil repairPermissions / /code/pre  After it's finished restart your machine.
