How does iPhoto synchronize photos between my macbook pro and my wife's one? <body> When my wife imports photos on her mac book pro, they are quickly synchronized in my own iPhoto.   We share the same apple id, but I do not remember having set anything specific to have this (excellent) behavior. How does it work ? (that means : what is the setting to obtain this behavior ?)  <answer117736> There are two possible answers here:  ol liYou are both sharing the same iCloud/.me/.mac account. Look in System Preferences  iCloud  [Account Details] on both systems to compare./li liThat your wife has shared a Photo Stream with you. Run iPhoto and look at the left hand sidebar in the section named 'Shared'./li /ol  <comment137675> Thanks for the explanation. We effectively share the same appleId. So, in that case, every photo is synced with full size... Interesting.
