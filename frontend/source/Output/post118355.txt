Shared Screen and DVD movies <body> I use a new Mac Mini in my stereo system. It has a monitor but does not have Keyboard or mouse. It is controlled with screen sharing from a Mac Book.  My question is related to viewing DVD movies, the store bought kind. With screen sharing active a DVD is inserted into the drive and movie window appears and the sound starts but the playback window is grey.  To get the picture to appear I have to turn off screen sharing. Only then can we watch the movie.   How can I continue to use screen sharing and view DVD's.    <answer118363> I have the same problem when viewing something via iTunes. There is no way to watch a video through screen sharing (you get a grey screen both on the host and the client).  <answer118383> This is a silly copy protection measure. If you use VLC rather than Apple's DVD Player you get no problem at all.  First, go to codeSystem Preferences/code  codeCDs &amp; DVDs/code and change the setting for codeWhen You Insert a Video DVD/code from codeDVD Player/code to codeIgnore/code or choose other and select codeVLC 2/code in your Applications folder.  Now when you insert a DVD VLC 2 will run and should autostart. No grey boxes.  <comment138122> You never actually posed a question in the above text. I recon this is some stupid anti-piracy measure <comment138128> go and try vnc instead of screen sharing
