Update Dock after defaults write without `killall` restart <body> I'm toggling a Mission Control setting with codedefaults write/code but the Dock doesn't see the change without restarting via codekillall Dock/code. How can I get the Dock to read the updated plist settings without killing it?   The setting is stored in the codecom.apple.dock/code plist, this is the command to update it (toggling the boolean):  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock expose-group-apps -bool FALSE /code/pre  Ideally, I want to use this command to quickly change the setting so I can use both window grouping modes with Mission Control, but restarting the dock is slow and disruptive, usually expanding any application windows minimized into the Dock. Is there some sort of notification/ping I can use to alert the Dock to its new settings?  <answer240123> In a word, no.  The only way to get the Dock to re-read its preference plist is to kill it and wait for it to respawn.
