BootCamp error: "The USB drive cannot be used." <body> Helo, I am trying to install Windows 10 on my iMac. I have an 8GB USB stick which I have formatted according to Bootcamp Assistant (MS-DOS FAT &amp; Master Boot Record). However, I get the following error in BootCamp Assistant:  strongThe USB drive cannot be used./strong  The drive doesn't have enough free space. It needs to have at least 2 GB free space available.  I've opened Disk Utility and to my surprise I've noticed that my freshly formatted USB stick had 0kb free capacity.  How can I get my USB stick to work and install Windows 10?
