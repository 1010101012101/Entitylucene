IMAP files trashed and greyed out - can't recover in Mail.app <body> A few days ago, my IMAP files were sent to the trash (if I did it, it was by accident, but I really don't remember doing it...) So the main file is there in the trash but I cannot scroll down the files, and its greyed out. And also I cannot recover the files, or put them back on the inbox!! Any ideas?  Here's a picture of what it looks like!br/Thank you for your help!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SThr7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer237803> i took away the IMAP prefix in settings : imap.secureserver.net left it blank and now it works again.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UuXaM.png" alt="  "
