Terminal not responding to "which", "type", etc. commands <body> I tried to look for the full path of the TextEdit app in the terminal using the command which and whereis but the terminal doesn't respond. it just skips to the next line like there was no command:  precodeLast login: Thu Sep 17 21:30:51 on ttys000 Tomass-MacBook-Pro:~ SOLANOT$ which textedit Tomass-MacBook-Pro:~ SOLANOT$  /code/pre  This also happens with codetype/code and codewhereis/code but not with commands such as codels/code or codecd/code. What is causing this? I've read that some users experience total loss of commands response, including codels/code, etc.  <answer206216> textedit is not on the PATH normally so which and whereas which search that will not find it.  ls and cd look in any directory and so can see the files  In the GUI the Finder is the app (or in command line open) that knows where to find Text to open a file.  <comment249059> so when can i use commands "which" and "type"? <comment249074> To find commands that are on your path or supply the full path to type etc
