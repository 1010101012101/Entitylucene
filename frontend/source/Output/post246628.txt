Is Trash a safe storage for files? <body> Are files moved to Trash do stay there until it is explicitly manually emptied?  My maintenance script automatically moves certain files to Trash, and I'd like to be sure I can recover them if necessary.  Links to references are welcome.  <answer246641> Yes - they stay there until the trash is emptied.  You can learn all about the trash here.  <comment304217> Yes, unless you have a program set up to auto delete files from the trash they'll just stay there. <comment304251> If you want to be sure of the ability to recover files then implement a proper backup solution, e.g Time Machine, not depend on something being in the Trash. <comment304252> I save all my back-ups in the Trash and I have done this for years. Super secure, go on! - Joking apart, be warned that the next macOS (Sierra) does empty the Trash automatically when it decides it's a good idea. You can deactivate this behavior though <comment304374> @Zozor Thank you for the information about Sierra. This is exactly what I was afraid of.
