How can I make the face recognition process continue? <body> Right now, if I go on the People section of photos.app, a message says it has analysed emx/em photos, while the remaining emy/em photos will be analysed when I'm not using the app and my Mac is connected to a power source.  What exatcly is meant by "not using the app"? Should it be open, but not the foreground application? Hidden? Closed? Can it run while the Mac is in sleeping? (I saw in the logs emphotoanalysisd/em   asking to run at priority Maintenance).  I'm asking because it's not making the progress I would expect andI'm having trouble understanding exactly how should I leave it.  <answer256505> According to this blog post Photos.app should be closed, as codephotoanalysisd/code is suspended while the application is open. The explanation given in the Photos application is definitely too vague. Still, I have the same issue of not experiencing the progress that I would have expected (4.900 / 12.000 in seven days).  <answer260024> I came across this issue too. However, having followed the instructions for quitting the Photos app and staying logged in I only saw small progress. HOWEVER, I soon discovered that I also had Photos set up as my screensaver, therefore as far as I can figure this violates the rule used by the OS to process the photos when not logged into to Photos. I have changed my screensaver to use the National Geographic images and now it is processing the photos a lot quicker.
