How do I delete my number from iMessage on send and receive from my iMac? <body> When I go to settings, iMessage does not show up under anything and I cannot access iMessage settings straight from the iMessage icon. Please help! There was a previous answer that said you could press command and comma, but when I press this, I get this picture. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1nmww.png" alt="enter image description here"  Please help! Thank you!  <answer162320> First make sure that iMessage is the active application, i.e. the word iMessage shows on the top left in your menu bar. Then press kbdcmd/kbd+kbd,/kbd to access the preferences.  This works for most apps, in your question you demonstrate this for Firefox.  <comment189691> You should try pressing command+comma when the iMessage app is active (i.e. the program names shows in the top left part of the menu bar). Now you have opened your Firefox preferences... <comment189693> @BartArondson correct answer, you might want to put it as an answer :) <comment189694> But shouldn't the question be "How to detect in which Application I am?" :) ?
