Invalid Calendar Items showing in iPhone <body> I have several Exchange/Outlook accounts connected to my iPhone.  On one of my calendars, several recurring events from several years ago recently reappeared and will not let me delete them.  When I look in Outlook, the events are not there.  I have attempted to move all of the items out of the affected calendar (via Outlook) into a new one, but the invalid items remain on my iPhone.  When I try to delete or decline the event, it simply returns to the main screen and the item remains.  Is there a way for me to purge these invalid items from my iPhone?  <comment346337> It's been awhile since I had a similar issue, the resolution was to log into iCloud.com from a regular browser on a computer and delete the event there. <comment346355> Hi @Tyson, I logged into iCloud and none of my calendars are there.  They originate from my Office 365 accounts. <comment346360> I Guess that doesn't help.  At the time, my calendar was exchange also, but some feature copied every event to iCloud and in certain circumstances re-curing events would not delete until it was done on iCloud .
