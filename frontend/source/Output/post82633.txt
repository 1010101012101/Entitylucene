how to reinstall mountain lion after restoring my macbook pro to the factory setting <body> I just recently bought my macbook pro early 2011 and it was freezing all the time for whatever reason. So, I decided to restore the computer. I erase the disk using the recovery method, but I'm having a hard time reinstalling mountain lion. As I didn't purchased the mountain lion with my apple ID, it won't let me reinstall it and I can't access anything in my computer. What should I do at this point. Any help will be really appreciated. Thanks!
