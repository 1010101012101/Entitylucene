How to completely remove Folx on Mac OS X? <body> I installed Folx download manager on my MacBook Pro. I didn't like it, so I removed it from the Applications folder. I also searched for its dependent files in code/Library/Preferences/code, but I found nothing related to Folx.   Now, when I try to download files, it tries to download using Folxâ€”but Folx doesn't work. How can I fix this problem?  <answer7424> To remove Folx you are to use its uninstaller.  <answer7511> If you use Firefox you should also unistall Folx plugin (Tools-Add-ons-Plugins-Folx Downloader Netscape plug-in - disable)  <answer80067> Download official uninstaller below: (Thanks Gilles for the comment)  Folx - Uninstall Folx  <answer103644> Go Download the Folx.dmg from their website, and open it.
