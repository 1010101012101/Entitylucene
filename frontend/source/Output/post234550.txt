Keyboard shortcut for Force Quitting the current application? <body> Instead of pressing codeCommand + Option + Esc/code to bring up the Force Quit menu, is there a way that I can force quit the application that I'm currently using directly?  <answer234552> Well, the Force Quit dialog opens with the currently running application already selected. So the shortcut is kind of kbdCmd-Opt-Esc/kbdkbdReturn/kbd (which IMHO is good enough for all practical purposes).  <answer234585> Found it â€“ the keyboard shortcut I was looking for was codeCommand + Option + Shift + Esc/code. This will quit the frozen app as long as it's in focus.  <comment286804> Never knew it was selected by default.
