Contact Sync Issue between MSOutlook and iTunes <body> I have been syncing my contacts for years from outlook with no problem by cable, I really like this. I have been running gmail business account with this in tandem as an exchange connection over this same window of time, no issues.  I have just added a new exchange account to my phone, it is exchange based and hosted by godaddy.com.  Once I added this to my phone, along with the outlook app for the iphone my cable sync stopped working and all my contact were gone from my address book on iphone.   I have tried a ton of forums and cannot find any answer on what may be the issue. Anyone have a solution or seen this before?
