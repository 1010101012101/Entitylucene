Why does my Mac with Xcode get so slow? <body> When I downloaded/Installed Xcode and worked with it, everything was normal like any other program.   But Xcode gets slower and slower over time the more things I write in it. This happens 'only' in the Xcode.  Does anyone know how to make it normal again?  <comment279478> What computer? What hard drive, how much space available? How much RAM? What does Activity Monitor say? <comment279479> It tells I can't comment .. I'll try here [![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DpE1z.jpg)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DpE1z.jpg)
