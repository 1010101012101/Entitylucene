single key keyboard shortcut run-or-raise applications <body> I just came from linux world (xfce4), where my keyboard workflow consisted of mapping   ul liF9 to terminal app/li lif10 to firefox/li lif11 to emacs/li /ul  Upon pressing, the corresponding app would a) get focused (raised) or b) started. I achieved that by using codewmctrl/code.  Can I achieve this natively in Sierra or is there an app for that?  <answer265920> There's no direct way to map an Application launch to a key command, but it can be achieved without too much difficulty.  To break it down into its components, you need    ul liA Service, which can be key-commanded  /li liAn Applescript, to contain the actual launch command/li liAn Automator workflow, to contain the Applescript/li liThe actual key-command./li /ul  It might sound hugely long-winded, but it's simpler than building your own .plist  ol liLaunch Automator, from Applications  /li liSelect New Document, then Service  /li liOn the left, search 'applescript' &amp; drag Run Applescript to the main panel img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuj1U.png" alt="enter image description here"  /li liReplace code(* Your script goes here *)/code with codetell Application "Terminal" to activate/codebr emUsing codeactivate/code will launch the App if it is not running, or bring it to the front if it already is./em [subsequent Services you generate will use each of your desired Apps in this line]  /li liClick at the top where it says 'Untitled' &amp; give it a suitable name. The destination will be already correct for Services.  /li liHit kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd S /kbd to Save.br emAt the moment I'm seeing a new behaviour I've not noticed before, under 10.11.6 - Saving isn't automatically installing the service.

Example config here  Tetsujins answer is great and is probably the native way.  Just for the record I eventually found an app http://www.apptivateapp.com/ (free at the time of writing) which does exactly what I wanted in few clicks without any hassle.   It also doesnt suffer from emacs capturing keystrokes and there is close to zero latency.  Still AppleScript loooks like powerful tool worth knowing.  <comment333618> Thanks for very detailed answer. I managed to write the scripts and they work in the Automator upon pressing the play button. However shortcuts seems to do nothing (There is a checkmark in the shortcuts window. cmdF9 doesnt work either, fn keys are F9 works without fn). Can I provide more info to so you can help me debug this? <comment333619> So they definitely appear as Services in the shortcuts panel - yet don't activate using the key command? I'd test using some command that couldn't possibly be duplicated elsewhere or confused with anything else; something like cmd/ctrl/opt/shift/z to eliminate either possibility. <comment333777> the issue was probably that Automator was not ticked in the System preferences  Security & privacy  Accessibility. So I got that one working. However I got 2 more issues. a) there is slight delay (±400ms?) and more importantly b) emacs catches the f[8,9,10] calls so it doesnt work when it is active window. Do you have any tips on that, or should I ask emacs folks? <comment334592> The delay might just be how long it takes a key command to find automator, find the command, activate, etc etc. Not really sure as I've never really timed one to see. Re emacs, it's not something I've ever used, so I'd think you may be better asking them, or post as a separate question in SE. <comment334593> Glad you found something to help. :)
