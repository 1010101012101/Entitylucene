Looking for Boot Camp Assistant App from Leopard <body> I have macOS Sierra installed on my MacBook Pro 13" from 2010.  I'm looking for the Boot Camp Assistant App download from Leopard for a Bootcamp Windows 7 x64 installation (!!!!NOT bootcamp drivers for Windows, but the app from Mac OS X Leopard 10.5!!!!).  My current version of Boot Camp Assistant App is 6.1 - it says that the iso of Win7x64 is not x64 and is not Win10.  I've edited the Info.plist as needed and codesigned it as well as the app itself.  I guess I need a version 3 or 4 of Boot Camp Assistant App.  I hope I'm not going to have to install the Leopard just to get Win7 on my mbp!  <comment373920> To my knowledge, the Boot Camp Assistant.app is not available for download separately. You have to either get it from a running install of the version of OS X that has the version of the BCA app you're looking for, or extract it out of the downloaded installer (OS X 10.7 and later, or DVD is earlier the OS X 10.7). That said, it may not run under macOS Sierra. <comment373924> @Tetsujin, To your now deleted comment "user3439894 - sure you got enough exclamation marks in there? Jeez." I did not write all those exclamation marks, it was a direct copy and paste from the OP as noted by, _as the OP states:_ and the double-quotes around it! Chill out! You don't need to apologize for not being perfect but you do own me an apology.
