My iPad and iPhone are not connecting with Bluetooth printer <body> I am trying to connect my iPhone and iPad to a Bluetooth printer, but the printer is not discoverable on my devices. However, the Bluetooth printer is easily discoverable on my Android device.  I tried turning on/off Bluetooth and resetting network settings, but neither of these solutions worked for me.  How can I connect the Bluetooth printer to my iOS devices?
