How can I use Jabber with OTR on IOS? <body> I would like to use Jabber with OTR Encoding on my iPad. Which clients are supporting this?  Apps already tried:  ul liChatSecure doesn't seem to work with XMPP./li liIM+ Pro is not recommended./li liTrillian has no OTR support./li /ul  <answer92441> ChatSecure works now:  Just enter Username and password and leave the other settings default:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q2rWR.png" alt="enter image description here"    In chat you can activate OTR at the top right corner  <answer120517> For iOS, I know I use PGP. Maybe this can help you.  <answer193098> use pgp/gpg + vpn. ios - it not hidden os  <comment108365> The referenced page is six months old, are you sure the apps tested there haven't changed in the meantime? <comment108371> I just tried it, and couldn't manage to connect to my jabber account with ChatSecure <comment160079> Although the program has to be started to get the messages, this is noch the perfect solution yet <comment173121> Doesnt work with some required servers xmpp. <comment173151> @Hmm: please clarify what you tried and what didn't work? Usually it works fine with XMPP <comment265470> How do you configure and/or what app do you use in order to use PGP & Jabber? <comment265472> Could you elaborate? "not hidden os", what do you mean? <comment344791> ChatSecure also doesn't work for me (error message with the jabber.de SSL certificate, no way to bypass it, registration also errors out). There really are no other jabber clients on ios?
