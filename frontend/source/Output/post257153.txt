Time Machine won't backup after the initial backup <body> My TimeMachine won't successfully perform any backups after the initial one to a drive. I have tried connecting TM to two different drives, one is a QNAP NAS and the other is a USB 2TB drive.  With the NAS, it will usually get stuck in the "preparing backup" stage. With the USB drive it will get started, but then just stops.  The process doesn't actually end as doing a tmutil status shows it is running. However, it's not saving anything.  My hardware is a MacBook Pro early 2011 running macOS Sierra.  This started happening just before the sierra install. It looked like it was getting snapshots, but it really wasn't.  Also, there is no "inProgress" file to speak of, so I can't delete that.
