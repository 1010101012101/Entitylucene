I cannot log in to itunes store at all. What is wrong?  <answer210761> Re: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/210759/85275    "According to Apple Support System Status, now, the iTunes Store Service may be unavailable for some users."  <answer210768> I would recommend trying to sign out through the strongStore/strong menu on the top, and then signing back in, then restart iTunes after a few seconds. It could be coincidence, but that did the trick for me. Good luck!  <answer210794> This works....was signed in and did not know it...after the iTunes stored deleted all the "genius" recommendations (hang in there.it can take a while) everything popped right back up..many thanks for a short, precise, fix.
