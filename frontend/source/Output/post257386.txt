What is the best way to automate PDF page extraction and conversion into jpg for downloaded files in iOS? <body> From time to time I need to check a webpage, download a PDF file from there, find something inside, extract that page and convert it to an image. I can do it easily on macOS, but on iOS it gets more complicated. It would be great if I could on the way, using my iPhone.  I have been trying a way to do it using the apps I know. My last try was with Workflow, but it seems that it does not support PDF to JPG conversion. I may try to write some code in Pythonista and it can probably work out, but i would prefer a simpler solution. Is there an app/solution that can accomplish this?  <answer258158> I'm using this.
