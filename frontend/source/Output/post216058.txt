How to create desktop shortcut for Chrome profile and run two or more profiles simultaneously? <body> I am new to Mac, and I have my rough time (missing keys, wrong shortcuts and etc). But I don't give up. I am a JS developer with more than 10 years of Windows and Linux (Debian, Ubuntu) experience and I need another Chrome profile accessible on a demand. The easiest way for me is another icon in Dock (and on the desktop). It is very easy in Windows - one just have to make shortcut and enter command line for chrome which looks like this: codegoogle-chrome --profile-directory=Default/code  For OS X I found command line is  codeopen -a "Google Chrome" --args --profile-directory=Default/code  How to make a shortcut in Dock and on Desktop using it?  Please mind the subject (question), it is important for me, that shortcuts has to allow running multiple profiles simultaneously. I didn't stated it first time, because it was emobvious/em for me it will work that way (Linux and Windows just do it).  <answer216096> Since there are several possible answers, I will introduce a more exotic one:  ul liDownload and install Platypus/li liCreate a file chromedefault.sh in ~/Documents/scripts/ with the content:  precode#!/bin/bash open -a "Google Chrome" --args --profile-directory=Default /code/pre/li liOpen Platypus with the following settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSssB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  and create a new "app" emChromeDefault/em./li liFor a second app with the profile emOther/em use another script chromeother.sh with appropriate changes:   precode#!/bin/bash open -a "Google Chrome" --args --profile-directory=Other /code/pre  and call it emChromeOther/em./li liPut both apps in the /Applications folder and create as many symlinks or aliases as needed./li /ul  <answer240252> Open Script Editor from /Application/Utilities  create a new doc  paste following:   precodedo shell script "/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --profile-directory=Profile\\ 3 &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;" /code/pre  FYI:   code\\/code contains a space (the first back slash escapes the second back slash which escapes the space!);    and user profile code../Chrome/Profile 3/code will be code--profile-directory=Profile\\ 3/code in the code, code../Chrome/Profile 2/code will be code--profile-directory=Profile\\ 2/code, code../Chrome/Default/code will be code--profile-directory=Default/code  Try to run it and save it if it works.  <comment261240> I have a problem with this solution, when Chrome runs Default profile running command `open -a "Google Chrome" --args --profile-directory=Other` makes only current Chrome window focus.
