Is is possible to format an Applescript dialog? <body> I am writing an AppleScript and I'd like to be able to format text in a codedisplay dialog/code box. For instance, I want part of the text to be bold or italic. How can I do this?  <answer50267> Barring using Cocoa dialogs and integrating them into your script (emway/em out of the scope of this question – and of my expertise, too), you can’t. AppleScript’s codedisplay dialog/code does not allow for typographic formatting (and neither does the only script friendly alternative to AppleScript’s inbuilt abilities, Carsten Blüm’s Pashua).  If all you need is for the first (supposedly most important) part of the text to be emphasized, you can use codedisplay alert/code instead of codedisplay dialog/code  precodedisplay alert "this is the important part" message "… and this is not" /code/pre  which will give you this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CU3Bk.png" alt="display alert example"  <comment57598> I don't beleive you can from what I remember, but I'd need to check hence comment (not an answer) <comment57618> Will `display alert` allow you to have a text input? <comment57629> @daviesgeek: nope. It’s strictly a message type dialog. <comment57658> Too bad. I need a text input box. :-(
