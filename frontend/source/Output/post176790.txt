Programmatically catch app opening / closing <body> Is it possible, via an AppleScript, a background service or daemon, or any other programmatic way, to catch the following events:  ul lia specific app (eg Aperture, Excel ...) being launched,/li lian app being closed or quitting,/li lian app going to the foreground or background ?/li /ul  Purpose would to be change some system state/pref  (eg keyboard layout, screen profile etc) in an app-dependent manner.   Of course, suggestions of existing solutions are welcome.  <answer176803> You can obtain notifications of applications being launched and quit. Apple's strongTN2050: Observing Process Lifetimes Without Polling/strong provides the detail.  The best method for general purpose tracking is with codeNSWorkspace/code and its codeNSWorkspaceDidLaunchApplicationNotification/code and codeNSWorkspaceDidTerminateApplicationNotification/code notifications.  I do not believe there is a trivial means to implement these TN2050's methods in AppleScript. You will likely need to write a small Objective-C/Cocoa application or use a third party tool.  <comment208865> Thanks. My Cocoa is a bit old but I should have thought of notifications. Seems to be the right tool indeed.
