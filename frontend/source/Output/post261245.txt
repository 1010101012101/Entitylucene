Forward port to another machine <body> I'm trying to forward the port 9666 on my Mac running Sierra to a machine in my local network, 192.168.178.100, also port 9666.  I have tried the things described here, however it did not work for me. I assume I have to take more steps as I do not want to forward to 127.0.0.1 but to another machine.  I appreciate any help !  <comment327191> Welcome to Ask Different. You might need to show exactly what you did or didn't change from the other post. Those lines won't work for your situation so getting exactly what you tried here is needed for someone to point out a mistake or omission or change you need to make
