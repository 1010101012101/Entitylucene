Apps for making geometric shapes (math) <body> Is there any apps for making geometric shapes (math)? I need to make shapes like rhombus and equilateral triangles.   I have already posted this in the math forum, but I think this is more related to apple.  <answer139465> h1Grapher.app/h1  You might want to take a look at /Application/Utilities/Grapher.app. It is a graphical calculator that can create 2D and 3D shapes.  xsup2/supysup2/supzsup2/sup=42  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q73ju.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is a starters tutorial that looks fine: http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-grapher-your-macs-built-in-graph-tool--mac-48440  <answer139468> strongOmnigraffle/strong  If You want to use drag'n'drop solution I can recommend Omnigraffle https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle. It's very powerful but not free. You can get additional stencils from https://www.graffletopia.com.  <comment164440> Have You tried OSX builtin `Grapher.app` ? <comment164441> and do you mean Illustrator? Or more something like R? <comment164442> Something with a drag and drop interface. I have never used R. Is it something like that?
