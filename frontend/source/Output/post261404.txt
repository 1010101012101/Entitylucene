Pass argument through python script into notification <body> Trying to receive file name in python script and send result to notification. As I understood file names should be in codesys.argv[1:]/code.  precodeimport sys print sys.argv[1:] /code/pre  But eventually getting empty array in notification  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8EAxJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Script in message is basically the same as in initial python script.
