Trim the middle of a file name <body> I have a lot of files in a directory that have code[!]/code in the file name. Is there a way to trim that out with a command in the terminal? Here's an example filename. codefile001[!].ext/code  <answer175939> I would just use the 'sed' command.  You can run a for each loop over all the files and parse out the "[!]".  precodesed 's/\[!]//' /code/pre  for loop version:  precodefor f in /path/to/files/*; do rename=`echo "$f" | sed 's/\[!]//'` mv "$f" "$rename" done /code/pre  Otherwise I would suggest installing "rename" from homebrew if you have that installed.  I also have a Automator right click service that does batch rename's if you would like a graphical way.  <answer176005> Yosemite features a graphical way to do this. Select all the files you want to rename, Control-click on them, select "Rename x Items...", and you'll get what is basically a find-and-replace window for file names.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vVUf6.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  In your case, select "Replace text" and substitute "[!]" with the empty string.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzcH4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment207555> you want to remove a specific character in file name? <comment207559> character's'. Specifically, the one's I mentioned. `[!]` <comment207629> I'd add an `if` statement before `mv` to preserve timestamps for files that do not need to be renamed. <comment207717> Got to say did not know about. Nice one
