Is it possible to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 8 to iOS 7? <body> iOS 8 in my iPhone 5 drains the battery, I'd like to return to iOS 7 if I can.  Is it possible?  <answer150627> Nope.   Apple has stopped 'signing' for iOS 7.  Unless some new 'method' is found, the change is irreversible.  <comment177292> Are you on 8.0.2? The latest update (8.0.2) should have fixed a lot of battery problems.
