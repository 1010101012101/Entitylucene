Volume Keys not working with HDMI audio on mac OSX Lion? <body> I have a mac mini 2011 with OSX Lion. And I have connected my monitor (with integrated speakers) through hdmi port. The sound is working fine, but the volume keys on the keyboard don't work.  When I press one of them the volume image appears on the screen but with a prohibited signal.  Is there a way to fix this and make my keyboard keys change the system volume?  By the way, they work very well when I use another audio output device     <answer33213> The audio signal over HDMI is encoded. Encoded audio streams should be normalized to 0 dB. You cannot change this behavior as the audio signal would not be normalized anymore. You can only use the volume controls of your TV set.  Some programs (like iTunes) have volume control themselves, those can be used to change the volume of that specific program. (Although this goes somewhat against the principle that HDMI audio should be normalized.)  See also this discussion on Apple Support Communities (same answer).  <answer87985> See a solution here for the problem - http://www.vanetta.net/2012/07/enabling-hdmi-audio-controls-on-2011.html  Requires the free third party app - https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/ but it works perfectly.  <answer162442> A solution using the free version of Sound Siphon     To solve both of these issues:    Launch the Sound Siphon app. In Sound   Siphonâ€™s preferences select your output device as the pass through   device. Turn Sound Siphon on.      Sound Siphon processes the audio before it goes to your output device.   Now you can use your keyboard to control the volume"   http://staticz.com/add-keyboard-volume-controls/  <answer180843> ol liInstall Homebrew:  coderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"/code/li liInstall Cask  codebrew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask/code/li liInstall Soundflower:  codebrew cask install soundflower/code/li liReboot./li liStart codesoundflowerbed/code (find it by pressing codecmd-space/code to open spotlight): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nCnCb.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the Soundflower icon in the top-right and select your output device (You should pick HDMI instead of DisplayPort):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJkdT.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liIn the sound preferences, pick Soundflower:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/87SAJ.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <comment49480> Why in windows it is possible? <comment49481> So would this explanation be similar to analog signals where line out is expected to be an absolute signal where the headphone jacks increase and decrease volume by design and not necessarily be fit to the "line level" constraints? <comment68925> While this is a nice *excuse*, it's a bad answer because we still can't control it and it's a pain being unable to. <comment68933> Even more - what if I want to control the volume remotely from the web? <comment102965> Because Microsoft sees things differently, and dislike industry standard. LOL. Anyway, Apple's way of not letting people adjust the volume is correct, though not user-friendly. Basically you can think HDMI as DVI + Optical + sometimes Ethernet. <comment179771> FYI, latest compiled binary is at http://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/ <comment181235> Exactly @cawas. Windows, BTW, can control HDMI audio perfectly using the keyboard volume keys - when a monitor is the selected audio device, the volume controls the internal amp. <comment214920> Soundflower produces audio lag though so it's not a really good alternative since every 5 minutes you feel like you're watching a dubbed movie. <comment214924> I notice no lag whatsoever on my machine. <comment228055> I see that you have the same monitor U2515H as I do -- yet when I switch Soundflower to DisplayPort via Soundflowerbed it seems to always hang. Anyone else have this problem? <comment228143> @MichaelScottCuthbert yeah, Soundflower crashes a lot with me too. I just kill it (using activity monitor) and try again. <comment230242> Figured it out.  In Audio MIDI Setup under "Audio Devices" switch the format for Soundflower from 44.1khz to 48khz (48000.0hz).  Stopped the crashing. <comment237853> fwiw, if this is important to you, Soundflower is not a signed extension, so it won't work (yet?) on OS X 10.11 <comment249726> Unfortunately Soundflower is very buggy for 2CH on MacBook and takes for 64CH up to 30% CPU. Therefor not really usable anymore... <comment249727> Thanks to @MichaelScottCuthbert ! Helped a lot. Cannot live without Soundflower since volume keys of monitor are not really reachable... But is there also a solution for the high CPU usage when using 64CH? (at my MacBook this takes up to 30% when enabled as output!) <comment249769> I can't believe that OS X doesn't even let the mute key work.  I mean, it might be hard or impossible (though Windows does it) to reduce the volume of encrypted digital sound, but cutting it off all together should be possible. <comment249777> Mattingalls' signed fork (v 2.0b2) at https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases has worked for me to get volume out over DisplayPort again under El Capitan.  Super Kudos!  It did not include Soundflowerbed, so I needed to install 1.6 and then install 2.0b2 over it. (and switch 44.1khz to 48khz again). And no reboot needed. <comment249778> Note the signed version (2.0b2) at https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases  is needed for El Capitan (see comment below). <comment253152> Has anyone been using this smoothly on Yosemite or later? Soundflowerbed keeps crashing/hanging for me. <comment317365> Related to @Strinder's comment, currently using 2.0b2 on El Capitan on a MacBook Pro from 2013 and it uses under 2-3% of my CPU at all times, so personally I have no issues w/ the CPU audio processing - Great solution, thanks Soundflower and poster!
