How to properly run nginx on port 80 with a non root account on OS X? <body> I was trying to configure nginx (homebrew) to run like daemon on OS X 10.9 and I encountered one problem regarding permissions:  nginx was configured to run as nobody in nginx.conf and when started it was launching two processes, one a root and another one as nobody.   The server was responding on port 80, but was not able to serve the files because it did not have the permission to access them - the files were in my user directory, with group codestaff/code and accessible but other users.  Still, even if I tried to force nginx to use the staff group by using 'user nobody staff;' inside nginx.config, it didn't want to serve the files until I configured it to use root.  I know that would be dangerous and I wonder what would be the correct approach.  <comment126828> When you run `ps -G staff` are you able to see the `nginx` process listed (indicating that it has `setgid()` correctly?) It may also be handy to use the built-in `www` user/group to run `nginx`
