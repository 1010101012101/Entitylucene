Is there any way to recover your apple ID if you forget both your password and your recovery key? <body> Is there any way to recover your apple ID if you forget both your password and your recovery key?  If this happens: would it mean you wouldn't be able to use your your iOS devices that used that apple ID with activation lock active?  Could you contact Apple to solve this issue?  I hope it never happens to me, but I'd just like to know this.  <answer262682> This happened to me! I created a new Apple ID using my device (because it was the only way to create an Apple ID without having to have a non-iCloud email account associated with it), didn't realise that Find My iPhone was switched on, and then promptly forgot both the password and the security questions/answers for the account. I could still use the device, but I was unable to switch off Find My iPhone or erase the device. So I force-restored the device, but was then presented with the activation lock.  Apple helped me reset the activation lock strongbecause I was able to prove that I purchased the device/strong. Your receipt contains identifying information such as the Serial Number and IMEI number, so when I provided Apple with this receipt, they were able to remove the activation lock for me.  But I never recovered the Apple ID itself.  <answer263594> Apple covers the options fairly well at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204921  The short answer is it depends.   <comment330229> Possible duplicate of [How can I bypass Activation Lock?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114985/how-can-i-bypass-activation-lock)
