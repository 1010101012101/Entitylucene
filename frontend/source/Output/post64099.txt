Writing code on System 6? <body> I have a Macintosh SE FD HD running Apple System 6. Is there a Terminal application? What programming language(s) can I run on System 6?   <answer64111> There is no terminal application for System 6, at least not out of the box.  There is Macintosh Programmers Workshop and a couple of other oddities around, as well as things like telnet clients for connecting to other computers.    While I don't know all possible programming languages, MPW will give you a command line, C, C++, and Pascal.  Other languages I've seen were Chipmunk BASIC, Perl, and other development environments that were common were Think C and Metrowerks CodeWarrior.  Here is a random webpage about it.  <comment75193> @Moshe, I'd poke around the entire site, http://www.euronet.nl/users/mvdk/develop.html.  It looks to be fairly updated and you'll probably find a lot of valuable information over there. <comment75195> Thanks @SoFly I should have linked there rather than to the one I did.
