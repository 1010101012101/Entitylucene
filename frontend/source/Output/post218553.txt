iterm + tmux isn't allowing me to scroll up with the mouse <body> I recently rebuilt my system and everything works except I can't scroll my (iterm2) terminal window back to look at commands and output that have scrolled off the screen.  Without tmux I can scroll but with tmux I can't  When using vim this isn't an issue as I can scroll back within vim.  For basic terminal (which I don't normally use) the behavior is a little different in that the current line scrolls back to show previous commands, but just that line, not the whole window.  My terminal settings include: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ioGNn.png" alt="enter image description here"  I do use tmux and I have a detailed .tmux.conf  strongHowever/strong I have removed these settings, applied with codetmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf/code,. seen the changes applied (back to default tmux setting) and still have the issue   My settings include   precodeset -g mouse on /code/pre  <answer219205> The recent release of tmux 2.1 changed some of the configuration options. This bit of code (taken from here) restores the previous functionality:  precodebind -n WheelUpPane if-shell -F -t = "#{mouse_any_flag}" "send-keys -M" "if -Ft= '#{pane_in_mode}' 'send-keys -M' 'select-pane -t=; copy-mode -e; send-keys -M'"   bind -n WheelDownPane select-pane -t= \; send-keys -M  /code/pre  Add/place these in the code~/.tmux.conf/code file  Apply with codetmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf/code  <comment265334> Great.  Updated to mention `.tmux.conf`` <comment265357> Works on one mac and one Ubuntu machine without errors but another mac says unknown `unknown key: WheelUpPane` and `unknown key: WheelDownpane` it has the same osx version (Yosemite) and has same version of iterm2 (2.1.4) and tmux (1.9a)
