Delete Xcode shared folder <body> Can I delete the Developer  Xcode  Shared folder? I want to clear out space and noticed that it takes up 2 gigs of data. Is it safe to delete? I use Xcode often.  <answer174598> If you're talking about ~/Library/Developer/Shared, then this folder contains all the documentation for the OS X and iOS frameworks (if applicable). This folder should not be deleted if you require access to the documentation.  <comment205593> documentation, as in, guides and info? <comment205595> @Demosthenes All the documentation in Documentation & API Reference (open Xcode and press ⇧⌘0). This includes autocomplete for method names in iOS/OS X, etc.
