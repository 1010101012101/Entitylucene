Manage Finder favourites with defaults write or similar? <body> I've been unable to find any preferences list file with the locations for the 'Favorites' list shown in the Finder sidebar. No luck from likely candidates codecom.apple.finder/code and codecom.apple.sidebarlists/code.  Is there one, such that I can edit this list with codedefaults/code?  Failing that, is there a way of managing this list via AppleScript?
