Resetting old MacBook Air to factory defaults <body> I got an old MacBook Air. I know very little about it, because I got it as a workstation in a new job and nobody has any info about it.  I'm also a Mac newbie. These are the specs: it's running Snow Leopard, it has 128GB SSD, Core 2 Duo 1,86 GHz CPU and 2GB RAM.  I'm trying to factory reset it but don't know how.  Which MacBook edition is it? 2010 or 2011? How do I factory reset it? There is no USB in the box, just some CDs (and the computer doesn't even have an optical drive).  <answer71004> The simplest manner would be to use the Air's Remote Disc functionality to re-install the OS using an erase and install.  <comment82470> if that is the simplest way, I don't know if I want to hear more complex ones... :/ <comment82473> I suppose you could pay to upgrade to Lion or later and use the Recovery HD to self-wipe the machine. That would be less steps. Target mode is easiest, but you'll need another Mac to do the reinstall. Lots of ways to skin this cat. :)
