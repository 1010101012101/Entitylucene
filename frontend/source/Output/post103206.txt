iphone 4 update to ios 7 failed - cycles in and out of restart screen <body> IOS7 appears to have been installed on my Iphone 4.  It comes on, apps start but then the "restart screen" appears after 1-30 secs.  After another 20-60 secs, the "restart screen" disappears and the app begins where it had left off.  Just to be clear, by "restart screen" I mean a black background with centered white apple and a progress bar beneath the apple.  The progress bar lights up to maybe 1-3% but never any further (and sometimes less) no matter how long it remains in this state.  <answer103231> If you have a recent backup (and thus aren't afraid of doing a fresh install and restore), there are a few things to try - all of them involve putting the phone in a mode that makes iTunes prompt you to do a complete restore/update/sync afresh.  ul liPut the phone in Recovery Mode, and restore it./li /ul  If that doesn't help:  ul liTry putting the phone in DFU mode and restoring it./li liIf you find the above instructions difficult to follow, especially with the timing between actions ul lijust download redsn0w (look for the download links at the bottom of the blog post)/li lirun redsn0w/li ligo to the DFU option/li liit will guide you step-by-step to put the phone in DFU mode/li lionce that's done, restore it from iTunes.

After all that research and fooling with hosts files and god knows what.  BUT ... sorry to say, that exact flickering meant I needed a new LCD.   Much cheaper, though, through a local independent repair guy. Or see ifixit.com.
