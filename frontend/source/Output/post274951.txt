Who is hosting the remote disc when reinstalling OS from remote disc <body> I have a used mac book pro and have to reinstall the OS from remote disc. My question is: is the remote disc in this case (OS install) hosted by Apple or is it hosted by some other users' laptops?  <answer274959> Remote Disk is a method for sharing another user's CD/DVD drive over your local network, if your own Mac doesn't have an optical drive. It's not a method for installing an OS onto a blank Mac.   For that you would use Internet Recovery to reinstall your OS from scratch;br hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd R /kbd  at the boot chimes.br This will load the image directly from Apple.
