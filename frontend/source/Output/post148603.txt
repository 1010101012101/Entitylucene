Macbook Pro 180 Degree Screen <body> I have a 2011 MacBook Pro  With OS X 10.9.3  the 2.3 GHZ Intel i5 and 8 GB of 1333 MHZ DDR3 Ram. When I plug in my Cintiq Companion Hybrid. I run it in mirror mode at 720P because the Cintiq has a HDMI connection. I am left handed so I have to flip the Cintiq screen 180 degrees to use the hot keys. Although, when I do this I notice the mouse pointer "jumps" on the Cintiq display. It only happens when the mouse is over the URL bar on Safari and the menu's on PhotoShop (I haven't tested it elsewhere to see if it has the same issues on other software)  Any ideas besides don't run the screen at 180 degrees?
