How to make "Go to Folder" show current path? <body> One thing about MacOS I don't understand is how to quickly navigate the Finder in terms of quickly editing your file path.  I.e in a centralised Version Control I may have   precode/Software Projects/My Project/Branch1/Solution/Models/ /code/pre  and I want to get to   precode/Software Projects/My Project/Branch2/Solution/Models/ /code/pre  In Windows, I would just quickly go to the file path and swap the 1 for a 2, but in Mac "Go To Folder" always retains the last folder I used, and it appears I either have to type the whole path out, or open a second Finder window, "Go to Folder", drag the folder from my first window in and emthen/em swap the 1 for a 2.  There MUST be a way for "Go to folder" to just load the current working directory...but I can't seem to find a way anywhere!  Thanks  <answer261645> A pretty quick solution in Sierra:  ul liPress kbdcmd/kbd + kbdalt/kbd + kbdC/kbd or kbdalt/kbd + right click on item - copy "foo" as path name/li liThen press kbdcmd/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdG/kbd and paste your copied path with kbdcmd/kbd + kbdV/kbd/li liEdit your pasted path and press kbdEnter/kbd/li /ul
