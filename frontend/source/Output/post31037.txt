Where can I find a pricing guide for used Apple devices? <body> I am looking for a pricing guide for used Apple laptops, desktops, and iOS devices. Does anyone have a recommendation on where to go to find a guide like this? Preferably a free guide.  <answer31044> http://www.everymac.com has estimated current price for every model (It's at the bottom of the table). I'm not sure where they are getting those from though.  <answer31045> Check out Gazelle. They buy Apple products, as well as many other consumer electronics.  <answer31046> For the most recent price for a particular model in some particular condition, I try to find a bunch of completed sales on eBay with best matching descriptions and pick the median closing bid price.  Noting the variance in prices is also important, since used devices don't really have any fixed price.  It depends on the buyer, seller, location and date (phase-of-the-moon, last poker hand, etc.).  YMMV.  <answer56354> Try eBay or check out Green Star Tronics.  <answer183293> I would suggest BuyBackWorld to get the cash trade in value of your Apple products.  Their Apple buyback program lets you sell iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, etc to them instantly.  <comment35630> One resource is http://sellyourmac.com. They'll give you an instant quote, which is good info even if you don't plan on selling to them. (They do almost all Apple hardware) <comment35636> +1 I like the serial number lookup. Thanks! <comment35637> +1 Very easy to use and has more than just Apple products!
