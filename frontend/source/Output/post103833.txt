Can I have a custom desktop wallpaper 'Change Picture' interval? <body> In strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongDesktop &amp; Screen Saver/strong, it's possible to set an interval for changing the desktop wallpaper picture:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AQ1U6.png" width="340"  However, you are limited to a few specific times:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t48uH.png" height="200"  strongIs it possible to set a custom time for this interval?/strong  <answer103928> I found this Apple scripts web page with examples.  There is a line in this script for the change of interval time allowing you to specify it, and you can customize the rest of the script to your needs.  precodetell application "System Events"  -- RANDOM ROTATION OF A FOLDER OF IMAGES  tell current desktop  set picture rotation to 1 -- (0=off, 1=interval, 2=login, 3=sleep)  set random order to true  set pictures folder to file "Mac OS X:Library:Desktop Pictures:Plants:"  set change interval to 5.0 -- seconds  end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment122266> I had a look at `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist` but that was no help, so I `defaults read com.apple.desktop` and found this `ChangeTime = 1800;` when divided by 60 was the interval that mine is set to (30mins). So I'm guessing if you could work out how to write this to the defaults for the desktop, you may be able to find a solution to your answer. <comment122336> You know how to run a apple script from terminal! Than check this site out for samples and customize it. There is a sample with "set change interval to 5.0 -- seconds" <comment122375> @DanijelJames `ChangeTime` looks promising, but all instances of [`ChangeTime` are set to 1800](http://f.cl.ly/items/332u1s102y0w3T2u3E3Q/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-01%20at%2018.46.58.png) *regardless of my setting* in System Preferences… <comment122381> ups...http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/features/system-prefs.html <comment122385> @Buscar웃 Thanks, [the AppleScript](http://f.cl.ly/items/2m3A1D1G2O1w3s1d152g/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-01%20at%2019.23.12.png) works!
