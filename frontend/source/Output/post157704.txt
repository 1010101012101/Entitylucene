13'' Mid-2012 Pro, can I use FireWire to VGA for a triple screen setup? <body> I have a mid-2012 13'' Macbook Pro. I'm currently using a Thunderbolt to VGA to use a second monitor.  I'm feeling myself in need for a third monitor for my work. I was wondering if it was possible to use a Firewire to VGA adapter to plug in a third screen?  I'm worried that my Macbook can only support 2 screens, and even if it could support three, I'm not sure I can do that with the Firewire to VGA adapter.  I'm looking for advice from seasoned Apple guys.  (Both external displays would be the same, I don't have the specs here but they're old VGA monitors with relatively low resolution)  <answer157714> As far as I know such device simply don't exist.  <comment185511> Possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152138/how-can-i-connect-a-third-monitor-to-my-macbook-pro-13
