Can I set the "Exercise" goal for my Apple Watch Activity app? <body> The Apple Watch Activity allows for setting an overall "Move" goal, but I don't see how to change the "Exercise" goal from the default 30 minutes. Is there a way to accomplish this?  <answer186218> No there is no way to accomplish this.  From Apple - Apple Watch     You close the Exercise ring when you reach the globally recommended 30 minutes of exercise per day. And you don’t even have to do it all at once, which means you’re more likely to fit it into your day.   From all searches I have performed I have not found any possible way to change it and the above quote suggests that 30 minutes is the amount Apple has fixed on (the call it "recommended").   <answer189356> You aren't limited to one time around the ring in the Activity app. You get a double arrow for 1 hour of exercise, for example. You also receive awards for doubling or tripling the exercise ring.   You can use the Workout app to set whatever exercise goal you like. And you get a custom ring to fill in that app, based on target calories, distance, or time.   <answer190255> You open the activity app on your watch, then use force touch to adjust your daily goals. However, you can only modify the daily move goal (calorie goal), but not exercise or stand goal at this time.  <answer207761> I know exactly what you mean...When setting up the Apple Watch, they ask you whether you want the 30 min. for MOVE to be easy, medium, or strenuous. But once it's been set up there is no way to change it to either of the other levels.  <answer216725> On your watch, press hard on the activity screen in the activity app. You can increase/decrease the daily calorie burn goal. Doesn't look like you can change any other as of yet.  <answer227803> Most of the answers in this thread are incorrect. As of posting this, you can not change the exercise goal. As stated in the first answer this is set firm.  Additionally, the exercise ring always has a double-arrow. The icon does not change.  <comment219850> How does it suggest "that 30 minutes is the *recommended* ... amount"? By whom? For what kind of user? For what sort of health goals? All it suggests to me is that it can't be changed. Why that's the case is anyone's guess, but assuming that it's the result of some recommendation — that it is perceived to be good for us in some way — is a step too far. <comment219898> The above quote suggests that it is locked to 30 minutes. I don't know who or where the quote came from. Because it says globally recommended 30 minutes it leads me to believe they researched and came up with 30 minutes. You can send a feature request to apple to request the ability to change the exercise time. https://www.apple.com/feedback/ <comment220099> @raxacoricofallapatorius: 30 minutes is usually stated (such as by the World Health Organization, Mayo Clinic, etc.) as a recommended amount. Presumably because this is an easy number to remember, pass on, and aim for. Of course, these groups also usually go into more specific details afterwards and customization might be nice in this case. Or a better third party app. <comment222877> 30 minutes is a good minimum, but it's pretty crazy that apple doesn't let you set yourself higher goals. For active individuals it's pretty useless to have a "goal" that you'll meet easily. <comment223299> I agree.  30 minutes is a completely useless goal for me personally.  Every morning it comes up and says I met my goal!  Makes me laugh.  I do over an hour of exercise daily.  It would be useful if it pushed me to say... 90 minutes.  But at 30 minutes it's just annoying I think. <comment250671> Where's that setting? <comment261985> That's not the question. <comment268175> Wow, this is beyond lame. I'm a knowledge worker and 12 hours a day of standing is never going to happen. I would've been happy to get 8 and feel a sense of achievement for that. <comment300126> It's not 12 hours of standing it's standing once an hour for 12 hours.  They want you to stand up and walk around once per hour for 12 hours
