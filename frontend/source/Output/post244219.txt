New uninitialised SSD not showing in Disk Utility <body> I have bought a new Samsung EVO 850 SSD, it is yet unformatted. I have a SATAI/II to USB3.0 dock which I want to use to get the drive formatted, but it is just not showing up in Disk Utility (Recovery mode or plain) or even Disk Management on Windows. I have a Macbook Pro 17" Early-2011 [El Capitan 10.11.5] and want to clone my current HDD to this SSD using Carbon Copy Cloner.  The dock I am using is this exact one: https://www.amazon.com/Vantec-3-5-Inch-Drive-Black-NST-D300S3-BK/dp/B007B5PQW4  The SSD is this one: http://www.samsung.com/za/consumer/memory-storage/memory-storage/ssd/MZ-75E250BW  I have read of a few people successfully installing this drive into their Macbook Pro, but success eludes me.  Is the drive maybe broken? Or is the dock preventing the drive from showing up? Or am I doing something wrong.  <answer244222> The first thing to do with any SSD problems, is check that the drive has the latest firmware. I had an Intel SSD that was simply not seen on a Mac, but worked fine in a PC. I upgraded the drive's firmware, and now the Mac can see the drive, and even boot from it.  Find the latest firmware for the drive, and try applying it.  strongNOTE:/strong updating the firmware on an SSD usually wipes all the data on it! I know you said that it is currently uninitialised and unused, but please be aware of this before attempting a firmware update.  <comment300920> Just checked, there are currently no firmware upgrades for this drive. <comment300921> Oh well, it was a good idea ... <comment300924> If you plug the drive internally in the 17" MacBook Pro, can the computer see the drive? That would eliminate the dock from the chain, at least. <comment300925> I think that it might be the cause, yes, because I plugged it into my friend's Windows and wiggled the drive, and something showed up, but then disappeared after a few seconds. So I'm guessing my dock's connector on the inside is iffy <comment300926> Time for a new dock! Then you can plug the SSD in internally, plug the current HDD into the new dock, then boot from the external HDD and transfer to the SSD using Carbon Copy Cloner <comment300927> I'm going to buy a SATA to USB3 adapter and see it that helps, otherwise I will do as you said, put in the SSD and external the HDD. <comment300935> So it was the dock that was faulty, bought a simple SATA to USB2 adapter at the local cabling shop and it immediately showed up when I plugged in the drive.
