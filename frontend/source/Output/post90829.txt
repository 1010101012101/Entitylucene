make new Finder windows open at current folder <body> In Windows when I browse in Explorer, if I open a new Explorer window, it is opened to the same location as the window I had selected when I hit Ctrl-N. Is there a way of doing the same with Finder? So if I'm browsed to Pictures, when I hit Command-N, the new Finder window opens showing Pictures.  strongEdit:/strong to clarify, what happens now is that regardless of where I have browsed to, when I hit Command-N, the new Finder window opens in my home directory code/Users/my_user//code.  <answer90831> Finder on OS X doesn't have an option to re-open the most recent folder.  It is tracked in the Go menu, but if you look at the Finder preferences, it expects you to leave the default new window folder or select another target which will be the folder shown each time you open a new window.  <answer90840> You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "Finder"     try         target of Finder window 1         make new Finder window to result     on error         make new Finder window to home     end try end tell /code/pre  This would also change some properties:  precodetell application "Finder"     try         tell Finder window 1             set t to target             set b to bounds             set cv to current view             set sw to sidebar width             set sv to statusbar visible             set tv to toolbar visible         end tell     on error         make new Finder window to home         return     end try     make new Finder window to t     tell result         set bounds to {(item 1 of b) + 20, (item 2 of b) + 20, (item 3 of b) + 20, (item 4 of b) + 20}         set current view to cv         set sidebar width to sw         set statusbar visible to sv         set toolbar visible to tv     end tell end tell /code/pre  codetarget of Finder window 1/code is the folder shown on the title bar. It doesn't depend on the selection in list view.  You can also use ⌃⌘↑ to reveal the location shown on the title bar in a new window. It doesn't work in column view if the toolbar is hidden though.  <answer90843> ⌃⌘↑ and ⌃⌘O / ⌃⌘↓ invert the behavior for opening new windows for folders in some cases:  ul liIf "Always open folders in a new window" is not checked: all views when the toolbar is shown, all views except column view when the toolbar is not shown./li liIf "Always open folders in a new window" is checked: no views when the toolbar is shown, all views when the toolbar is not shown./li /ul  So if "Always open folders in a new window" is not checked and the toolbar is not hidden, you can use ⌃⌘↑ to open an enclosing folder in a new window or ⌃⌘O / ⌃⌘↓ to open a selected folder in a new window.  <answer90972>    what happens now is that regardless of where I have browsed to, when I   hit Command-N, the new Finder window opens in my home directory   /Users/my_user/   When there are no Finder windows open, a new Finder window created by clicking on Finder in the dock, from the Finder menu, or by using Command-N, will open to the folder you have set in Finder preferences.   BUT if Finder preferences are set to Always Open Folders in New Window, Command-O will open a new window for any selected folder.   (Seems to me there used to be a shortcut to close the previous window as you opened the new.)  <answer91784> Enable show path in the view menu (not sure about the menu names but it should appear at the bottom of the finder window) then cmd + double click the folder you want to open, in this case, the last folder is your current folder.  I made an image but can't post it :\  Edit: Image example img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ktcM.png" alt="Duplicate Finder window"  <answer232407> It is simple:  Go to "finder  preferences  general tab"  Uncheck to "Open folders in tabs instead of new window".  You're done!  ⌘+double-click to the folder.  <answer255749> Pressing kbdCommand/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdO/kbd will open a new Finder tab/window at the same location.  <comment106657> OK. I am a dummy. I read your question 3 times, and still don't get it. You want to open a new window of same folder as window before (a duplicate). I use cmd-o.... <comment106659> is it cmd-o he is asking about? <comment106663> Yeah, it's convenient when you're moving files. Say I've got some files in Folder1/Folder2 that I want to move to Folder1/Folder3. In Windows, I would open Folder1 in Explorer, hit Ctrl-N and the second window would also be open to Folder1. Then I browse to Folder2 in one window and Folder3 in the other. I don't have to first navigate to Folder1 in the second window because it's already open to there. <comment106666> +1. Nice script + info! One question, how would make the fallback window your _default_ selected New Finder window option if you've changed it from 'home'? <comment106759> @Buscar웃 I doubt it. The Open menu item in finder doesn't open a new window (command-O by default). Only the new windows commands actually open a new finder window. <comment106761> Sarah - your use case is very common. Apple's recent folders design doesn't really help, so most people just put the common locations in the sidebar or use a launch tool like [Launchbar](http://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) to push files to a specific folder with the keyboard rather than having Finder keep track of the last location. The big problem is the concept that Finder maintains a "current" folder once you close the last remaining finder window. <comment106829> Actually, at least on 10.8.3, Command-O opens a new Finder window. As does Command-N, so what the heck is up with that? <comment106896> You could use `defaults read com.apple.finder NewWindowTargetPath || defaults read com.apple.finder NewWindowTarget`. NewWindowTargetPath doesn't exist if the default location is for example the computer view. <comment107074> @Zo219 Interesting. I have 4 Macs and **File  Open** is disabled in finder unless you have selected a file or folder. I wonder what is selected or different on Macs where Open does something when nothing is selected. Even if I turn on the setting "Always Open Folders in New Window", I still get no Open menu enabled in Finder when nothing is selected. If this works for you, it's unclear why several Macs that are set up brand new with no changes on 10.8.3 don't work the same. <comment107260> Damn, you're right. And all these years and I never twigged on Select anything and hit Open. For above comment, I always had a Folder selected. Not sure anymore about answer below, either. Comm-N and Comm-O seem to do same thing. <comment107842> Thanks @grgarside, I was following your suggestion and appears I now can add images. <comment283984> But that doesn't open the folder you're currently viewing in a new tab, it opens the one you clicked. <comment283997> couldn't get you. <comment283998> Isn't this what OP wanted? `make new Finder windows open at current folder` <comment284003> They way I read it, they want a way to open a duplicate of the current Finder window... but perhaps I misunderstood. <comment284009> That what it does. <comment284015> Hmm ok, it doesn't for me. That's odd. <comment338999> This is the best / easiest solution I've found - thank you for this! Never knew this shortcut. It's preferable to Command-double click. Only problem is you have to have the folder selected in the Finder - if you have selected anything within the folder, the shortcut does nothing. : (
