how to change "kind" of files in OSX mavericks? <body> I have assigned Text Wrangler as the default app for all my strong.srt/strong files (right click on one of the files - get info - open with Text Wrangler - change all).  My confusion is that even though I have done this, in Finder some of the (.srt) files show as "Text file" while most show as "TextWrangler document".  I've remove all the .DS_Store files in my volume but still no change.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  In saying that, double-clicking on the .srt files marked as "text file" still opens them in Text Wrangler.  thanks a lot  <answer130373> File type associations are cached by LaunchServices and can become corrupt.
