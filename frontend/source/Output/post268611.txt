Is it possible to change the default window size of a .txt file in TextEdit? <body> I have a .txt file that I open regularly on my Mac. I would like the TextEdit window of this .txt file to be wider than it normally is.  I can manually increase the window width every time I open the file by left-clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner further to the right. But, it would be much more convenient if the window was wider by default.  hr  I have tried adjusting the TextEdit window size while holding down the kbdshift/kbd key.  I have tried adjusting the TextEdit window size while holding down the kbd âŒ˜ command/kbd key.  I have tried adjusting the TextEdit window size while holding down the kbdcontrol/kbd key.  After quitting TextEdit and then re-opening the .txt file, none of the above methods recall the previously-set window size.  hr  I am also open to a method that uses AppleScript to set the window size before the file is opened. Here's the AppleScript command that I currently employ to open the file:  precodedo shell script "open -e " &amp; quoted form of Target_Filepath /code/pre  <answer268667> Instead of changing the default windows size, unless you want to make it permanent and you can just change it in TextEdit  Preferences... then, you can use the following example AppleScript emcode/em to open the document in TextEdit and set its size and position on the screen.  First, open the target file, resize and position it on the screen where you want it and the use the following AppleScript emcode/em to get the codebounds/code of the emdocument window/em to use going forward.  precodetell application "TextEdit" to get bounds of front window /code/pre  It will return a codelist/code, e.g.: code{0, 22, 900, 600}/code, to use with the codeset bounds .../code emcommand/em.  precodeset targetFile to POSIX path of (path to documents folder) &amp; "Filename.txt"  tell application "TextEdit"     activate     open targetFile     set bounds of front window to {0, 22, 900, 600} end tell /code/pre  hr  Note: The reason I'm suggesting the above method is because while one can technically change the default size of the document window programmatically nonetheless since TextEdit doesn't support a codeposition/code emproperty/em it makes sense to use the codebounds/code emproperty/em as the first two emlist items/em in the codebounds/code emproperty/em  are its position.  However, if you really want to change the default size prior to opening the target document regardless of it position, here is the information surrounding the default window size. Under TextEdit  Preferences...  New Document  Window Size the default Width is 90 characters and the default Height is 30 lines. With these defaults there are no emkeys/em in the codecom.apple.TextEdit.plist/code file for this however the corresponding emkeys/em are codeWidthInChars/code and codeHeightInChars/code, which support an eminteger/em value.  You'd need to test for the existence of these emkeys/em and capture their values so as to have something to reset to after opening the target document. If they are the true defaults, the emkeys/em will not exist and you can temporarily set a eminteger/em value for these emkeys/em, open the target document and then delete the emkeys/em. The target document window will open with the new values at the default location of TextEdit's choice, not yours. If you want it in a different location you'd need to use codeset bounds .../code, which defeats programmatically temporarily changing the defaults or the existing setting if not the default values.  Example emcode/em using the codedefaults/code emcommand/em:  precodedefaults read $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist WidthInChars defaults read $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist HeightInChars  defaults write $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist WidthInChars -int 120 defaults write $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist HeightInChars -int 50  defaults delete $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist WidthInChars defaults delete $HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist HeightInChars /code/pre  These can be used in a codedo shell script/code emcommand/em using codeset variableName to do shell script "defaults read ..."/code and then write the emlogic flow/em based on what's returned.  If you really want to go this route and need help with the coding, let me know.  Also note that testing surrounding this was done under macOS 10.12 and may be different in previous major OS version releases.  <comment337395> I've added a note to my answer which provides information surrounding the actual Title Question: "_Is it possible to change the default window size of a .txt file in TextEdit?_" <comment337503> The first method works. Thank you. Using the first method, there is a slight delay while the window size adjusts, but that is not a huge deal; I don't think this minor delay is worth the effort to implement the second method. <comment337504> Strangely enough, I've discovered that if you open an .rtf file in TextEdit, adjust the window size, and then save the .rtf file, TextEdit will recall your window size the next time this file is opened. This does not apply to .txt files for some reason. Also, the location of the window of an .rtf file is fixed and is not recalled after saving the file. <comment337505> @rubik's sphere, I did my testing using a plain text file having a `.txt` extension because that is what you had in your question. The info about a Rich Text .`rtf` file is interesting but really has no bering on your original question or my answer as it was not part of the question to begin with. <comment337507> Yes, I know. It wasn't really related to my question. I just thought that it was strange that .rtf files remember the previous window size, but .txt files do not.
