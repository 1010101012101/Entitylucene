How to Add Items to Power Nap <body> Is there a way to add applications/processes to the Power Nap function on a Mac? InÂ other words, instead of just the default Time Machine, Mail, etc. you can make it run other applications too. I am running a Mac Mini with OS X Yosemite.  Thanks  <answer209357> So far as I can tell, the answer is no. I can't find any mention of public APIs for developers to leverage Power Nap.  What did you have in mind? You could also put in an enhancement request at Apple.  <comment252532> I have in mind some specialized server software that responds to certain requests, processes them, and sends them back.
