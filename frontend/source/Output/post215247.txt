El Capitan auto-corrects even though I turned it off in settings <body> I notice that things are being corrected even when I turn spell-check off. This happened on both of my computers, and particularly stupid spelling corrections are taking place, only since upgrading to El Capitan.  Example.. I updated a ticket at work "This is now on production" .. when I submit the update, I see it says "This is not on production" ...  At first I thought maybe I did a typo but this keeps happening.  Every single instance was where the word is actually spelled correctly however it replaces it with another word.  I've turned spell-check off so I am confused as to why it's doing it at all.  <answer215248> There is only place to disable spell check in codeSystem Preferences/code and on doing that it works fine for me on codeEl Capitan/code. Can you try enabling and disabling again and probably a reboot to see if it helps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MYUTo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment259980> Grrrr - it's a pain when you can't change something like that. Is the issue something reproducible in a new user account? My guess is a preference file is corrupt or some rare filesystem errors, but that's a hunch and not a given. <comment259988> Check there isn't another pref set in the app you're using. I have spellcheck off in prefs/keyboard but on in Safari [tbh, I'm not really sure what the global pref is supposed to 'fix' as it doesn't carry to Safari/TextEdit etc] <comment260174> it's a pain that Apple software seems to consistently have problems with not being able to 'upgrade' to new OS. I don't like to start from scratch and have to take 50 hours to set up my stuff every time I upgrade to a new OS. I had a similar issue with iPhone but the issue was much more severe, and other people said too they didn't have the problem. When I started from scratch on new phone and lost everything in my apps and games, then it worked fine. <comment260178> I'm using system preferences Tetsujin. Interesting though I'm using Chrome. Maybe Chrome has its own thing? <comment297482> Every app also has its own place to regulate this, in Edit  Spelling and Grammar
