How do I list my unwatched iTunes purchases on Apple TV? <body> I'm thinking of "cutting the cord" and getting an Apple TV, and then buying an iTunes "season pass" for each of the TV shows I'm watching.  Does Apple TV provide a good way to list/find the episodes that I haven't watched yet, without having to wade through all the series, seasons, and episodes that I've already watched?  As time goes on, it seems like there would be a build-up of watched shows that would make it harder and harder to find the unwatched ones.  Apparently Hulu has a feature like this called "watchlist", but I can't find any information on a similar feature for shows purchased a-la-carte from Apple.  The closest I've seen is that you can apparently hide past purchases.
