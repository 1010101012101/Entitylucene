Set image from iTunes Extras's gallery as desktop picture <body> I just bought Mad Max: Fury Road from iTunes and wanted to set my desktop picture as one of the stills from the iTunes Extras's gallery.  How can I do that?  <answer200736> The easiest way would be to take a screenshot of the image. This is accomplished by pressing Cmd-Shift-4 and selecting the outline of the rectangle that you want to capture with the mouse.  <comment242043> it's a way but definitely not what I want. Maybe tomorrow I will spend sometime looking for it on my iTunes foder
