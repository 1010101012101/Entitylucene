MX Master continuously unpairing itself <body> I have an issue with my Logitech MX Master mouse continuously fail to reconnect when I get back to my desk. I have to press the connect button on the bottom of the mouse and pair it. This is getting annoying as I have to do this on a daily basis. Is there any way to make the mouse pair once and not have to worry about it again?  Thanks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zSuRf.png" alt="I only have one mouse..."

The most recent update was only released a few weeks ago. You can read more or download it from here.  If the update and info doesn't help, report back with the version of macOS you're running and the model of your Mac.  strong[EDIT]/strong  Since we've established your Mac supports Bluetooth Smart technology, which the MX Master needs if connecting via Bluetooth instead of USB, I see you have three options open to you:  ol licontact Logitech Support directly; /li liconnect the MX Master via USB cable instead; and,/li liresolve the issue preventing your upgrade to macOS Sierra. /li /ol  On the 3rd point, according to this you should be fine to upgrade to macOS Sierra if using Airwatch. Perhaps it would be worth you asking a separate question about this? You may find resolving that also resolves your MX Master issue, since you'd be able to install the latest version of the Logitech Control Centre.  <comment324168> Can you please clarify what version of macOS you're running? Otherwise it's very hard for the community to provide advice on your particular situation. It'd also be good to know (1) what model of Mac you're using it with? (2) Do you only have to pair it once a day or multiple times per day? (3) If it's only once a day, can we assume your Mac is switched off at night and rebooted again the next morning? (4) Do you have any other Bluetooth issues? If so, what? <comment324318> Sure thing @Monomeeth. <comment324322> I cannot install the version of Logitech Control Center you suggested as it is only for 10.12.0. Let's see what happens when I apply the latest update to El Capitan. <comment324325> Yes, that's what I meant, the latest version for your macOS. Sorry I wasn't clearer - but from the link I provided  you could access previous versions, so the latest that will run for you. Good luck - hope it helps! <comment324329> Welp, I cannot upgrade to macOS yet. This mouse is almost a year old and I literally have paired the mouse nearly a 100 times. It's rather sad that Logitech does not offer drivers for 10.11. <comment324330> Thanks for updating your question, but can you please provide your exact Mac model? <comment324352> @Monomeeth It is a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). What else do you need to know? <comment324359> Thanks. I just wanted to make sure your Mac model was actually compatible with Bluetooth Smart technology, which the MX Master needs if connecting via Bluetooth instead of USB. And yes, your Mac is compatible with Bluetooth Smart. <comment324360> At this point the only options I see are either (1) contact [Logitech Support](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/contact) directly; (2) connect the MX Master via USB cable instead; (3) resolve the issue preventing your upgrade to macOS Sierra. On that 3rd point, what Airwatch issues are preventing your update? According to [this](http://blogs.air-watch.com/2016/09/macos-sierra-vmware-airwatch-support/#.WBWIv3dh3Qg) you should be fine. Perhaps it would be worth you asking a separate question about this? <comment324488> @Monomeeth I have had this issue for 8 months. I contacted Logitech and read the forums, hence asking here and expanding my search. It really does not make sense to use the USB cable since I have limited desk space. Finally, Airwatch can say all it wants but it borks the keychain on El Capitan and borks the password on boot on macOS. Given that I help manage this for our company, we will have to wait until we can successfully upgrade without these issues. <comment324489> Fair enough. I have to admit the organisation I work for uses Airwatch as well. I have to say I'm not a big fan of it!
