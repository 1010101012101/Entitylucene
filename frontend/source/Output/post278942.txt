Double-shift hotkey to switch keyboard layouts (XKCD 1806) <body> In a recent xkcd, cueball tells white hat to 'hit both shift keys to change over to QWERTY'. Assuming I have the standard QWERTY and another layout installed, how can I switch between both using both shift keys?   Unfortunately, the manual described here does not work, since macOS fails to recognize double-shift as hotkey.  <comment351069> It is possible do accomplish this with [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) but not in Sierra because the app is still not compatible.
