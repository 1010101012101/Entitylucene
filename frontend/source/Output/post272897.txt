Screenshots and images won't open - Don't have permission to view it <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRf8h.png" alt="enter image description here"  Every time I take a screenshot I try to open it, but it says that I don't have the permission. It's not only my screenshots; all the pictures that I save say that I don't have any permission to open it.   Can anyone please help me resolve this problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Txyo1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer292632> I solved the situation.  All I had to do was quit preview.   <comment343011> Could you screenshot the permissions for the file you're trying to open? Right-click the file, and choose Get Info. Then, screenshot the "Sharing & Permissions" section. <comment343013> do I add the screenshot to my question <comment343014> Yep! That way anyone else trying to answer the question has all the information they need. <comment343016> Try this: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/209686/preview-refuses-to-open-pdf-file-incorrectly-claiming-a-permission-issue - it's for PDFs, but since your issue is with Preview, it might still work. <comment343036> @Allan that won't work. I created an image with the same permissions as OP, and I'm still able to read and write to it. <comment343044> Can you post the output of `ls -la ~/Desktop/Screen*` <comment343178> what do you mean <comment368189> @h.altaher Allan's comment is asking you to type the command into `Terminal`
