iPhone untethered jailbreak need redsn0w to startup <body> I've decided to jailbreak my iPhone 4. So I did. And I installed SiriPort to get siri. And it worked. I don't know why, but my iPhone crashes on startup!(I can only boot it with redsn0w) I don't know if it is siriport or something else! Any kind of help will be appreciated!  <comment75268> This is an interesting problem. So you're always having to "just boot tethered" in redsn0w every time you power-on your iPhone? Does it go into a non-Jailbreak state when it crashes on startup? (I'm not talking about MobileSubstrate Safe Mode, but rather that the Jailbreak doesn't exist until you boot tethered). <comment75569> @andrew Larsson It basically, once it starts up, it restarts springboard and then again and again and after like 5 times, it reboots again and continues to loop <comment76716> What tool did you use to Jailbreak it? It sometimes makes a small difference. <comment76838> @andrew Larsson I just used the latest version of redsn0w like usual!
