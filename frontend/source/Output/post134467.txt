.tblk file doesn't work <body> I am trying to set up Tunnelblick on my computer. (I have Mac OS X 10.9 on a 13" Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM.)  ol liI started by downloading Tunnelblick./li liNext, Tunnelblick automatically gave me the following file (called "config.ovpn"): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxYI7qMrKuDYV1BGUm4xQkZkbGs/edit?usp=sharing/li liAfter that, I followed the instructions by creating a folder called "Empty Tunnelblick VPN configuration" and copying "config.ovpn" to the folder. I then renamed the folder "Empty Tunnelblick VPN configuration.tblk"./li liI followed another set of instructions and then double-clicked the file "Empty Tunnelblick VPN configuration.tblk". However, I got the following error message:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fqNrO.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  What did I do wrong? How do I fix this problem?  <answer134489> Tunnelblick questions are better asked on the Tunnelblick Discussion Group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tunnelblick-discuss).  The problem is that line 88 of your configuration file contains a reference to a file named "ca.crt" and that file is not in the "Empty Tunnelblick VPN Configuration.tblk". All files referenced in a configuration file must be placed in the .tblk.  (The reason the paths are so weird is because Tunnelblick is referencing a temporary copy of the .tblk that you are trying to install.)  <comment159341> So what EXACTLY should I do? <comment229970> @TechMaster100: I had the same problem.  Ends up the `ca.crt` file had a lock on it.  Remove the lock and you should be fine.
