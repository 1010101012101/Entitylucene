How can I install bind-utils on El Capitan <body> I would like to use DNSSEC tools (like codednssec-keygen/code, codednssec-signzone/code, ...) on my Mac without running or installing the BIND9 service.  Unfortunately for me Homebrew seems only to have the BIND9 package, but not bind-utils The official website https://www.isc.org/downloads/ also doesn't provide these tools.  Can someone know how I can use these tools on Mac ?  <comment297104> I just downloaded https://github.com/tigeli/bind-utils and ran `bind-utils-master $ ./configure` and `make` and then in `bind-utils-master/bin/dnssec/` there was `dnssec-keygen` and `dnssec-signzone` as well as all the other bind-utils that were built in the `bind-utils-master $` directory structure.  You need to have Command Line Tools for Xcode installed. <comment297311> Thanks @user3439894. The link you provided doesn't seems official, but at the bottom of the page there is a link to the official git of BIND9 http://www.isc.org/git/ where all tools are also here. <comment297313> I got the following error : `checking for OpenSSL... configure error "/usr/bin/openssl/include/openssl/opensslv.h" not found`, So I installed openssl with `brew install openssl` and next  `./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local/opt/openssl/`. Now it's working great.
