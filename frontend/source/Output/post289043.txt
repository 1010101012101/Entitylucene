My terminal path in macOS SIerra is messed up <body> Few months ago, I was trying to download pygame on mac.  It was very difficult but I finally did it through terminal using bash.  But after the download, I think there was some change on default path on my Mac's terminal.  I searched many solutions through this site, but I can't solve the problem and I think those solutions are not really fit to my problem.  When I open terminal,  precodeLast login: Thu Jul 6 21:18:59 on ttys000 ojeonghuns-MacBook-Pro:~ hoon$ /code/pre  I can see this kind of message and i remember that i couldn't find the first line when i first use terminal.  and on that state, i cannot use command line like ls, cd .. etc  I can use only pwd as i know, and everytime when I want to use ls or cd, i have to export new path by entering this kind of command line,  precodeexport PATH=/usr/bin:/bin /code/pre  This leads me to use every command line, but everytime when i close and re-open the terminal, i have to set path.  If I echo $PATH , my path is  precode/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:’/usr/local/bin:?? /code/pre  I think i download one or two additional Python versions on my Mac.  So is it possible to set default path ?  Oh, and when I try to figure out by typing  codeopen ~/.bash_profile/code  I see the error message of     Trace/BPT trap: 5   <answer289044> The system's standard path (configured in /etc/paths) is code/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code. If you want to add an strongadditional/strong path like em/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/em to your user's PATH permanently you have to include the strongold/strong $PATH in the emexport PATH/em line - either at the end or at the beginning - in your .bash_profile file:  ul liexport PATH="new_path:$PATH"/li liexport PATH="$PATH:new_path"/li /ul  Additionally your PATH contains some unwanted characters like code’/code or code?/code and doesn't have a closing quote code"/code.  hr  Open Terminal and enter:  precode/usr/bin/nano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Change the line  precodeexport PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:’/usr/local/bin:??... /code/pre  to  precodeexport PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  If the file contains another line with export PATH="..." squeeze the required parts into the above line.  Save the mod with kbdctrl/kbdkbdO/kbd and quit nano with kbdctrl/kbdkbdX/kbd  Quit and relaunch Terminal and enter codeecho $PATH/code which should reveal at least:  precode/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  <comment365194> Thanks very much for your reply.
