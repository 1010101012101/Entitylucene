Duplicate icons in Applications Dock Stacks <body> A picture is worth a thousand words.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tu88M.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have a shortcut (not sure what the official word for this is) to my Applications folder in my Dock.  When opening it, I see multiple copies of the icon "Xcode.app".  If I "open in finder", I only see one. If I open the launchpad I also only see one.  Don't mind the folder called "Xcode 5", I added this only yesterday while this multi-icon bug has been there for over a month....  Running OSX 10.10.1  UPDATE: The official name for those shortcuts are "Stacks" (http://support.apple.com/en-il/HT201955)  <answer164124> This issue may be related to the preference configuration file.   Delete the stack and re-recreate it, it should work.  <answer164131> Run free utility Onyx (http://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html), tab Automation, check all operations. This shall fix extra icons (and many other inconsistencies too) after reboot :)  <answer180890> Right click Applications in Dock, remove it from Dock and then add again. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pGKuv.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbG0Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment192175> Have you tried removing that icon from the Dock by dragging it out, and then recreating a new one by dragging in the Applications folder? <comment192298> Just to clarify, the icons are not in the dock itself, but in the Stack (that's the official name) representing the Applications folder. And yes, I tried removing the icons - it doesn't really remove it. <comment192302> a mother account? <comment192303> Yes, goto "system preferences"-"User and group" ,create a new one, and you can login into the new account. this just for test, you can delete it at anytime. <comment192304> If you meant "another account" - then yes I created a new account, and there XCode only appears once. <comment192305> sorry for typo. delete the stack and re-create it, have you try it? <comment192310> The english you wrote made no sense. I have edited your answer to be clearer. It needs to be approved by StackExchange. <comment192354> I understand that the icons which are being duplicated are in the Applications folder. The troubleshooting step I provided here turns out to be the answer @nelson wrote up below. <comment196845> I'd like to point out that the issue came back by itself. I have a folder showing 6 times... <comment204595> This worked for me. <comment214995> I don't understand what do I need to delete. <comment215024> You are not right: those shortcuts can be in two forms - stacks or folders. See a screenshot in my answer below, section "Display as".
