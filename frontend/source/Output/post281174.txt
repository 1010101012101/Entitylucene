Auto-insert date in a cell when creating a new row? <body> strongNumbers 3.6.2/strong  I have a template with various data formats defined for each cell (stepper, pop-up menu, etc). strongI want one cell to automatically insert the date when a new row is created/strong.  I've set up "date" etc in the sidebar but the date is not inserted when a new row is created. Worse is that if I type anything but a strict code00/00/00/code format, the data type for the cell switches to automatic. The other cells restrict data entry (e.g. can't type in a "pop-up" menu cell).  I haven't used Numbers for a while but this template used to be able to do that. I've seen the other questions on this (like here: macOS/OS X Numbers 3.2 inserting date / time) but none of the suggestions for formulas, etc work. I know I can select "insert date" from the menubar (not even a keyboard comd for it??).   I've searched around and come up short. Am I missing it or is something as simple as date auto-insertion not possible? – thanks!  I haven't used Number for a while and went back.
