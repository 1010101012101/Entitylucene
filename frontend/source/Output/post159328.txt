Changing the pause required before Voice Commands in OS X Yosemite <body> Is there any way to change the pause required before Voice Commands in OS X Yosemite? I.e. if I want to dictate "hello world" then move the cursor on the left, I'll have to say "hello world move left": I would like to define how long the pause between "hello world" and "move left" should be in order for Yosemite to recognize that "move left" is a voice command.  E.g. in Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12.5 professional on Windows 7 SP1 x64 Ultimate I can change it like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ANpCg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment247818> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247819> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
