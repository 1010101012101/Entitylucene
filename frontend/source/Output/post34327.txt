Linking emails to calendar appointments <body> I have an iPhone 4S. I schedule all my appointments through the iPhone calendar app. Typically I receive an email with all the pertinent information  and in turn, I have to transfer all of the information from the email to the calendar. When the appointment comes around, I have to search through my email files in order to locate any additional information. Is there a way to link emails to the calendar in order to easily access them when my appointment date comes up?     <answer34329> You cannot link the emails and iCal events, however you can create the event by tapping on the date within the e-mail. You can then double tab on the content of the email, select all, and the copy and paste into the notes section of the iCal event.  <answer104251> if you drag and drop an email (without a date) from mail into calendar it WILL contain a link back to the email   <answer120621> You can forward the email to yourself and write a date ( like tomorrow at 16). In the received email this will be blue colour (tomorrow at 16) and you can create event directly from email. What is good? In calendar at that event you will (on URL) you will find Show the message in Mail and will open that email with attach and everything.  <comment122740> Seems like your answer is not intended for the iPhone (drag and drop?). Any clarity you can add for the iPhone 4s in this question would help.
