Can you play Clash of Clans using the same Apple ID? <body> Me and my brother want to play Clash of Clans with different game progress but somehow he always gets my progress when he plays it.  He got a new Apple ID and a new Game Center, but somehow the same problem is happening: we can't play the game separately - we tried and tried but it still doesn't work.  What can we do to play the game using different progress?  <answer111901> This game saves progress to Game Center. If you both use the same AppleID for Game Center to log in, that would explain what you are seeing.  <answer112037> Yes you can, but village is on your game center acc, so you must change your game center account and the game will start from zero.
