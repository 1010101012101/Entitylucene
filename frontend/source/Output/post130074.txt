Terminal Equivalent of Finder Sort Order <body> One of the features I like about the Finder is that it sorts numbers "correctly", i.e - a file named "Episode 10" will come after "Episode 9" in a list, rather than after "Episode 1".  However, I haven't been able to find a way to replicate this ordering on the command line with any of the basic tools such as codels/code, codesort/code and so-on, though I may have just missed or misunderstood an option.  Is it possible to mimic the Finder's alphabetic sort order to sort numbers by value when encountered? If so, is there a means of doing this that is cross-platform (even partially)?  <answer130075> GNU codels/code has the rather useful code-v/code option that will do exactly what you want. Unfortunately there's no similar option for OS X's BSD-based codels/code.   A quick solution is to do the following:  precode$ ls | sort -n -k1.5 /code/pre  That sorts the output starting at the 5th character of the first field.  The same question was asked at StackOverflow and there are a number of other possible solutions listed there (some are Linux-specific though).  <comment152333> wow...I did not know that :) <comment152465> Thanks for this! It's a shame there isn't something more generic I could use, but I may be able to use the `-k` option combined with a quick sampling of files to try and configure it automatically; unfortunately I'm not always working with consistent formats, but I'm trying to make it automatic =) <comment152466> @Haravikk You can always install GNU Coreutils and use the `ls` from there - probably easier than trying to fiddle with various `sort` parameters! It's easily installable from all of the third-party UNIX software installers - pkgsrc, MacPorts, Homebrew. <comment301248> The -k option is about fields, not columns. A field is separated by whitespace, and a different separator can be specified with -t. So `ls | sort -n -k 2 -t '_'` sorts a list with names like "prefix_12345" and "prefix_1234".
