Macbook Pro hard drive cable failure? <body> I'm asking a follow up question to this thread: Macbook Pro hard drive failing?  The thread concerns excessive beachballing and apparent hard disk problems.  After the answer that was provided, and since it seemed likely that my hard drive was failing, I decided to buy a Samsung 850 EVO 500GB SSD hard disk.  I cloned my original hard disk to the SSD, which booted externally without any problems and at full speed.  I decided to replace the original HD with the SSD, but after this procedure kept getting the white screen of death, until I hooked up my old, original HD externally.  I was able to boot without any problems from my old HD, and the beachballing and hard disk problems seemed to be completely gone. The SSD was recognized but not the partitions on it and it didn't seem like it could be read by the system.  After reattaching the SSD inside the Mac, it is now not even recognized by disk util anymore after booting from my internal old HD.  This must be a HD cable failure right? My Mac is mid 2012, and I've heard there are a lot of users with similar problems with my model!  <comment326965> I wouldn't say _must_ be, there are a whole host of reasons which could be the cause, such as a controller failure or (as you suggested) a cable failure.
