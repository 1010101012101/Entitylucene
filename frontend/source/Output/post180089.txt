iPhone reports 6GB of photos I can't find <body> My gallery is totally empty but in my usage it appears that 6.3 GB are used by 'photos and camera' and when i click on photos and camera photo stream is 4 KB and photo library is 6.2 GB.  <answer180104> When you open the photos app, make sure you click through all tabs at the bottom. Maybe you're in an album or stream. If that doesn't help, connect your iPhone to a computer to access the photos.   <comment213767> Try to be more clear with your title next time.
