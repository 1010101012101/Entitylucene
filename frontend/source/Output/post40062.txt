com.apple.qtkitserver CPU usage on OS X Lion <body> I'm on Lion 10.7.3 and every now and then, com.apple.qtkitserver hogs my CPU @ 100% for a little less than a minute, especially when there's something happening on Finder.  I know that QTKitServer is the Quick Look server, but it seems its generating files unexpectedly or something of the sort.  Does anyone have a fix?  Note: This started happening when I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion.  <answer54947> I was informed that download apptamer would solve the problem. The activity was reduced significantly. Right now I'm on a 15 day trial. It appears from what I found here: http://maccrazy.com/macbook-air-heat-fan-noise, that others have found it useful too  <answer66807> Normally this is due to unfinished/corrupted video files in your downloads folder. I am assuming this is the case for you.  This should solve the problem:  ol liOpen Finder an navigate to your downloads folder./li liRight-click and select emShow View Options/em. /li liUntick emShow Icon Preview/em./li /ol  <comment78992> QTKitServer is actually a QuickTime component, it may be used by QuickLook to show previews.
