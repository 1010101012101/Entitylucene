Unable to run secure remove (srm) command from AppleScript <body> I am unable to run the command codesrm/code in macOS 10.12, Sierra. I can run the command in Terminal.app but not from within an AppleScript.  This command works:  precodesrm -rf /Users/Jack/.Trash/ /code/pre  This command fails with codeerror "sh: srm: command not found" number 127/code:  precodedo shell script "srm -rf ~/.Trash/*" /code/pre  codesrm/code is not present in code/usr/local/bin/code.  <comment326256> What is the result of `which srm` ? <comment326262> How does the command fail, is there any error message? Does it work if you add the full path to `srm` in AppleScript?
