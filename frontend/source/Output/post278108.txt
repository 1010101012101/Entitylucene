Airport express, streaming iTunes music and data usage <body> For years we have streamed our personal iTunes library via the airport Express through our Bose system. Many of those years we were limited to 10 Gig per month of Hughes Net data and we had no problems. Now our Hugnes net plan gives us 15 gig but we are experiencing uploading of 300mb per hour. This situation has become recently impossible and we can't figure out what has changed. Several lengthy conversations with Apple support haven't provided any insights. Help appreciated.  <comment349993> Under iTunes preferences, is "enable iCloud music library" checked on? Make sure it is off!
