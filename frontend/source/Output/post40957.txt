What is another source for Dashboard widgets? <body> On the Apple Dashboard widgets page, the most recent app (found at the top of the Just Added section) is The Weather Channel Widget, released on February 14, 2011. Where can I find some more recent widgets?  <answer41035> The widget download page was a curated approach to enabling a single place to locate and install widgets from.  Developers would submit a Widget and associated details and host the file for downloads.  The lack of updates is down to 1 of 2 things:  1) Apple stopped accepting additions and ammendments to the listings, 2) Developers stopped submitting updates.  Both are probably true, and certainly a lot of developers stopped writing widgets in order to write iOS apps and such like instead, at least according to the anecdotal information I am aware of.  However, the listings as they stand are useful for identifying good widgets, just because no updates are listed doesn't mean none are available.  I searched for Time Machine Buddy which is a useful widget I use.  It's still listed, but at an older version on the Apple site.  However the link to the developer is included which allows me to check and download an updated version direct from the developer.  Unlike iOS apps, widgets can be hosted and downloaded from anywhere, they didn;t have to go onto the Apple site alone.  So you can use the directory to find interesting things, and then hit the developers direct to find updated version.  If a download link is dead, or the developer is no more, you can still find the download site useful to get the name of a widget, and then use tools like osx.iusethis.com to search for alternatives.  <answer91855> http://unity.gmer.freemac.org - UnityGmer http://unity.widgets.onemac.net - UnityWidgets http://dashboard.gmer.onemac.net - DashboardGmer – Get the best Mac OS X Dashboard Games. http://retro.gmer.onemac.net - RetroGmer – Awesome Retro Gaming http://gamewidgets.onemac.net - GameWidgets – Get Mac OS X Dashboard Games ! http://unity.play.onemac.net - UnityPlay http://mac.gmer.onemac.net - MacGmer http://widget.gmer.onemac.net - WidgetGmer – Mac OS X Dashboard Games http://game.centr.freemac.org - GameCentr – Get everything Mac Gaming ! http://gmer.apps.freemac.org - GmerApps http://gmer.widgets.freemac.org - GmerWidgets – Mac OS X Dashboard Games  http://the.dashboard.onemac.net - TheDashboard – Get Pimping Hot Mac OS X Dashboard Widgets http://mac.widgets.onemac.net - MacWidgets http://dashboard.center.onemac.net - DashboardCenter – Get the best Dashboard Widgets for your Mac http://dashboard.clocks.onemac.net - DashboardClocks – Get the best Mac OS X Dashboard Clocks http://dashboard.search.onemac.net - DashboardSearch – Mac OS X Dashboard Search Widgets http://dashboard.candy.freemac.org - DashboardCandy http://dashboard.widgets.onemac.net - DashboardWidgets http://clock.widgets.onemac.net - ClockWidgets – Get the best Mac OS X Dashboard Clocks http://pimp.my.dashboard.freemac.org - Pimp my Dashboard – Get The Best Mac OS X Dashboard Widgets  http://mac.onemac.net - Get Mac Tips, Tricks, Tutorials, Updates, Downloads, News… http://mac.support.freemac.org - MacSupport http://mac.101.freemac.org - Mac101 – Get one to one with your Mac ! http://mac.tips.onemac.net - MacTips – Get Mac OS X Tips, Tricks, Tutorials, News… http://osx.tips.onemac.net - OS X Tips http://garageband.tips.freemac.org - GarageBand Tips http://dashboard.tips.freemac.org - DashboardTips – Get Tips and Tricks for your Mac OS X Dashboard http://mac.help.onemac.net - MacHelp http://macvideos.onemac.net - Mac Videos  http://itunes.support.onemac.net - iTunesSupport http://safari.support.onemac.net - SafariSupport http://chrome.support.onemac.net - ChromeSupport http://google.support.onemac.net - GoogleSupport http://firefox.support.onemac.net - FirefoxSupport  http://app.center.freemac.org - AppCenter http://mac.wall.freemac.org - MacWall – Get beautiful wallpapers for your Desktop http://mac.center.freemac.org - MacCenter – Get Mac OS X Tips, News and Apps http://mac.apps.onemac.net - MacApps – Get Mac Software, Tips and New… http://mac.desktop.onemac.net - MacDesktop – Get Mac OS X Desktop Enhancements and Customization http://mac.downloads.onemac.net -  MacDownloads – Find the most popular downloads for your Mac ! http://download.center.freemac.org - DownloadCenter – Get Mac Downloads, Updates and Support http://music.center.freemac.org - MusicCenter – Get Mac OS X Music Apps, Downloads and Support http://menu.bars.freemac.org - MenuBars – Get super smart apps for the Mac OS X menu bar… http://mac.search.searchfree.net - MacSearch – Everything about search on Mac !  http://dev.center.onemac.net - DevCenter http://xcode.tips.onemac.net - XcodeTips – Get Xcode Development Tips, Tricks and Guides http://dashcode.tips.freemac.org - DashcodeTips – Developer Tips for Dashcode  http://ios.center.freemac.org - iOS Center – Get iPhone, iPad and iPod Support http://ios.support.onemac.net - iOS Support – Apps, News and Tips  <comment46364> This question cannot be answered with fact, only conjecture. We are not Apple and only Apple can answer it as it was originally asked. <comment46367> Well how was I supposed to know it wasn't a known fact? <comment46371> If you want help editing this into shape, we can reopen it. Are you looking to make new widgets with Dashcode, looking for other sources of widgets? Is there a deeper question other than looking for info / speculation / discussion about the future of widgets? <comment46387> I've often wondered this.  Good question. <comment46420> @bmike edited. Thanks for the suggestion. :) <comment46507> Thanks; I was specifically looking for some page or site *like* the Apple-curated one, but up-to-date. Would iusethis work? <comment46511> I think you are out of luck if you are trying to find a direct replacement, the above is my thoughts on getting decent widget info, but they are a bit old fashioned really, and haven't received much attention recently.  However, that may change, certainly the dashboard has had a lick of paint in Mountain Lion, and the fact that the interactive elements in iBooks2 format books are essentially pure widgets may result in a bit of a resurgence.
