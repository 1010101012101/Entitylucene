Bootcamp installation issues with slipstreamed Windows 7 on Macbook Pro <body> Running Bootcamp with Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit (genuine) on rMBP (late 2013). Windows update won't work though (endless searching for updates; common problem after a clean installation of Win 7 it seems) so I've tried installing a slipstreamed Windows 7 with updates integrated into the Windows iso file.  This fixes Win Update (no more endless searching for updates) but during the installation of Bootcamp the keyboard and touchpad become unresponsive as well as the USB port (from which Bootcamp is installing), resulting in an unfinished installation and an effective freeze.  Any thoughts on the cause or how to bypass the problem?
