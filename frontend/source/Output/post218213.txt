Can I disable the menu bar for the laptop screen but not for external monitors? <body> On my laptop screen I think the menu bar doesn't provide enough info to warrant the space it takes up. When I dock my laptop with a massive external monitor, I'd rather it showed.  Is there any way I can have it conditionally hidden depending on the display? Note that this is not the same as having it only show on one of two monitors: when my laptop is docked the laptop screen is closed, and when I'm not docked I only have one screen so there is no alternate screen to store the menu bar on.  Alternatively, is there a shortcut that toggle the visibility (control+fn+f2 doesn't count, it just shows it because it moves focus)?  I feel like I should be able to do something with Automator or something like that, but I can't work out how I'd do it.
