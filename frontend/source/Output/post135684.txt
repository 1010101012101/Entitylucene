USB Modem Recognized But No /dev File <body> I have two USB modems.  One is a US Robotics and it shows up in System Information and also has a device file in /dev.  (Actually, it has more than one file in /dev.)  I have an Encore modem, model ENF656-USB-AGER.  When I plug it into the USB bus, it shows up under System Information (highlighted in the image below):img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFMjb.png" alt="enter image description here"   So OS X gets the basic information on it.  (But I also notice the device has not been configured.)  Yet there is no file that appears in /dev to correspond to this modem.  Is there anything I can do to change that, or is this a case of a clear indication that this modem is not compatible with OS X (even though several sources state it is)?  I'm using OS X 10.9.3.  <comment160857> There are no drivers available. <comment160932> @Buscar웃: Where would I see that? (So I know where to look for this kind of thing the next time.) <comment160933> On they web site, they are not offering any for Mac. <comment160935> @Buscar웃: I mean where would the OS report that the device was plugged in and that it could not find a driver?
