System-wide config of gem operations? <body> The answer to just about everything gem related on El Capitan -- including installing fastlane -- for me has been using this switch code-n /usr/local/bin/code  (So codesudo gem install fastlane/code fails but codesudo gem -n /usr/local/bin install fastlane/code works.)  How can I apply this to all gem operations automatically?  <answer253453> Because El Capitan introduction to SIP (System Integrity Protection) you need to change your codeGEM_HOME/code or do similar something like codesudo gem install bundler -n /usr/local/bin/code.  <answer253454> Answer is from here.  In your code~/.gemrc/code put the single line  precodegem: -n/usr/local/bin /code/pre  <comment315397> thanks, didn't know it was due to SIP. <comment315640> Isn't there a space missing between `-n` and `/usr/lo...` or does it work like this? <comment315646> @klanomath empirically, it works. I also think that it would work on the command line like this, and many flags do not actually need a space (I think), because the ones that are words usually have two dashes like `--version`
