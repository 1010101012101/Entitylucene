Use Siri's voice as the system voice <body> I notice that on Sierra, Siri's voice is much superior to the selection of system voices you can select in System Preferences → Accessibility → Speech. In fact, I suspect they use a different system entirely as the command codesay -v ?/code doesn't seem to list any voices which are used with Siri.  I have a key command set up to speak the select text. Is there no way I can get it to use Siri's voice to do it?  strongEdit:/strong To be specific, I'm after the Siri voice: 'British (Male)'  <answer254024> The name of Siri's original voice is called "Samantha" in OS X/macOS.  You can use it using     say "hello" using Samantha   with AppleScript (script editor.app).   <comment316217> I probably should have specified the exact voice I was after in my question, as I didn't check to see if the other ones were available as system voices, but it's the 'British (Male)' one (the only male British voices available as system voices are Daniel and Oliver, both of which seem to be much lower quality). <comment316218> How does this answer the OP's question regarding how to set the Siri voice, whatever that voice is set to, as the voice for dictation when selecting text? <comment316234> @Robert 'Daniel' is the Siri's original male British voice (iOS 7) ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRhp0ZB8AVc&feature=youtu.be&t=2m40s ). Are you looking for the current version of the male British Siri voice? <comment316235> Yeah, the new one (on Sierra) is much higher quality. <comment316271> The name of the voice appears to be Arthur. If you go to `/System/Library/Speech/Voices`, you can see some of the voices there are specifically for Siri. I have: `AaronSiri.SpeechVoice`, `ArthurSiri.SpeechVoice`, `YelenaSiri.SpeechVoice`. `say -v` doesn't recognize them and their `Info.plist` differs from that of the normal voices. Although, they do include the same demo text string as the system voices so they were probably intended to be used as such at some point.
