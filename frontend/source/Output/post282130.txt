Uninstalled Accountability Software Still Encumbering Internet Connection <body> Hey so I have had connection problems for over a year now on my 2014 Macbook Pro, and after trying literally everything Google could point me towards I have found a possible culprit - but obviously I have no idea how to fix it.  After getting the computer I installed an accountability software called X3Watch that sends reports of flagged websites to a friend, to deter me from going to illicit websites and stuff.  When my computer started having problems (it was only slow when using anything requiring an Internet connection) I uninstalled the program thinking it was interfering with the browser.

No wonder it loads slowly.  But my question is: How do I fix this process.  I recently reinstalled my OS just to see, but it didn't do any good.  I'd like to avoid restoring to factory settings, but I am not opposed if it is the only way.  Any other thoughts on how to get my computer to stop going through this process?  <comment355234> How did you uninstall the app? Just by deleting it or with the AppleScript uninstaller? <comment355292> Most likely there is a LaunchAgent .plist file in /Users/your_username/Library/LaunchAgents . Check in that folder for a .plist file with a name that resembles x3d and chuck it in the trash, then restart. <comment355331> IconDaemon you were spot on! Found a plist in my LaunchDaemons folder. So far my laptop has been super fast since the restart. THANK YOU THIS WAS A HUGE FRUSTRATION FOR ME
