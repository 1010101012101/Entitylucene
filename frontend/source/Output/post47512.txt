How to remove the default application for opening a file? <body> How do you remove the default open with application for a file extension? Not change it but remove it so when I try to open it a popup says code"There is no application set to open the document “file.blabla”/code.  <answer47513> Use RCDefaultApp. With it, you can set the file association to code&lt;disabled&gt;/codebr Another option is to use the command line and codelsregister/code. codelsregister/code is located in code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support//code To see all the available commands, run code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister/code. See this article for more information.  <answer237525> All you need to do is right click on the file that you want to open, click "get info" (in the dropdown list) then click "Open with"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3dzp1.png" alt="enter image description here"  After that, select the application you want to open it up with, and select "Change all"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WikRu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hope this helps!  <comment54420> I know that, but I want to be able to remove the association, not change it. <comment54421> @stas Sorry! Updated my answer. <comment54423> Thanks but would you happen to know how to do this with the command line? If you don't I'll just use the app. <comment54424> @stas Updated again :-) <comment54430> Fantastic, thanks! I'm just not a big fan of installing tons of apps on my mac, each for doing only a single thing such as the RCDefaultApp. <comment54438> No problem. I'm trying to pare down my list too. :-)
