Can I use or access the San Francisco font that comes with El Capitan? <body> The new font emSan Francisco/em, introduced in El Capitan throughout OS X's Finder and contextual menus, is a beautiful font and proves that once again, Apple is on top of their game when it comes to defining the standards of UI and typography.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hKV8a.png" alt="enter image description here"  But when I try to find emSan Francisco/em in TextEdit or Keynote, it's not there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQGAF.png" alt="enter image description here"  The apps I use, whether Apple apps (Pages, Numbers, TextEdit...) or third-party apps (InDesign, Word...) do not display emSan Francisco/em as an option in their font menus.  Here's another example, from Apple's very own Keynote (whose default font is still Helvetica) - no San Francisco there either:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EC7Vq.png" alt="enter image description here"  Obviously, this font is there, somewhere in the system, since it's used almost everywhere! And Apple computers are sold with lots of fonts pre-installed in their System Folder, so it seems like a mistake to me, that this one in particular would be unavailable.  So, how could I "unlock" it, or make it usable in other applications?  NOTE: emThis question was first assuming - wrongly - that San Francisco was made available in Yosemite, which was a mistake. Turns out I still can't find and use it in El Capitan, so I just edited it to say "El Capitan" instead, and add a few images, but some comments might seem irrelevant./em  <answer215985> You can download it from here: https://developer.apple.com/fonts/  But there is this note in the license agreement:     IMPORTANT NOTE: THE APPLE SAN FRANCISCO FONT IS TO BE USED SOLELY FOR CREATING MOCK-UPS OF USER INTERFACES TO BE USED IN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS RUNNING ON APPLEâ€™S iOS OR OS X OPERATING SYSTEMS, AS APPLICABLE.   <comment248840> If you have a paid Apple Developer Account then from [Introducing San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) click on San Francisco Fonts under Download Fonts and accept the License Agreement... <comment248866> San Franciscos is coming with the new OS X version, El Capitan. It's not on Yosemite yet. <comment248920> Thanks! I thought I was looking at it but it's a different font sized Helvetica that is now being used in Yosemite I guess... <comment261543> Thank you very much for this! You helped me avoid using it for a professional print project. A "modern" take on type but a rather old approach to copyrights... <comment261627> Can't vote to close as this question has an open bounty - but imo it's a dupe of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208849/is-there-a-user-font-for-san-francisco-in-el-capitan <comment261631> Which is from october 3rd while mine was posted on sep 19, @Tetsujin imo it's the other one who's a dupe ;) <comment261633> hehe - fair point, though it was still referring to Yosemite until November, long after the other had an answer ;-) <comment261635> I understand, good point too, although the answer was true also when the question was about Yosemite, since the font is NOT accessible within El Capitan, but through another source :P <comment312481> link doesn't work w/o dev subscription
