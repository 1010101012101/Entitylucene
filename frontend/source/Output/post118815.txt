codesign reports invalid Info.plist on an app dl'ed from the internet. Has the app been possibly compromised? <body> I downloaded an app from github (mac2imgur), and it refused to run.  precode$ codesign -vv mac2imgur.app mac2imgur.app: invalid Info.plist (plist or signature have been modified) In architecture: x86_64 /code/pre  It seems unlikely the developer uploaded something with a bad signature.  Is this a red flag that the app may have been compromised and reuploaded?  <answer126215> It’s quite likely a developer uploaded something incorrectly codesigned. As a developer myself, I know it takes time to get it right, and many don’t bother.
