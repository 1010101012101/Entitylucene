Proper shebang line for running perl script with an AppleScript on a perlbrew install? <body> I have the following simple AppleScript which calls a perl script I wrote to clean the desktop:  precodedo shell script "/Users/stevied/bin/clean_desktop.pl" /code/pre  The script works fine when run from the command line, but when executing the script from my AppleScript, the modules I codeuse/code aren't found and I get this error:     Can't locate Modern/Perl.pm in @INC (you may need to install the   Modern::Perl module) (@INC contains:   /Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Library/Perl/5.18   /Network/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level   /Network/Library/Perl/5.18 /Library/Perl/Updates/5.18.2   /System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level   /System/Library/Perl/5.18   /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level   /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.18 .) at   /Users/stevied/bin/clean_desktop.pl line 3. BEGIN failed--compilation   aborted at /Users/stevied/bin/clean_desktop.pl line 3.   I have perlbrew installed. The current shebang line for the perl script is:  precode#! /usr/bin/env perl /code/pre  <answer285068> See first comment here for answer: http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1191380  <comment359410> I added the following line to the script: use lib `'/Users/stevied/perl5/lib/perl5';` but now get a very weird error: `dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _Perl_xs_handshake   Referenced from: /Users/stevied/perl5/lib/perl5/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/Mac/SystemDirectory/SystemDirectory.bundle   Expected in: flat namespace  dyld: Symbol not found: _Perl_xs_handshake   Referenced from: /Users/stevied/perl5/lib/perl5/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/Mac/SystemDirectory/SystemDirectory.bundle   Expected in: flat namespace` <comment359468> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment359469> Please add additional details, modifications or updates to your question (e.g. as addendum, update or *post-scriptum*) instead of adding comments!
