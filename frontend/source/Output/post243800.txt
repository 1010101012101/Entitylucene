This can happen for a number of reasons such as insufficient funds in your bank account.  If you have an unpaid transaction, iTunes requires you to add a valid payment method before you can continue using the iTunes Store/App Store. Even for free items.  You can see if you have any unpaid purchases by going into your 'Purchase History' (see example below) or contacting iTunes Support via email or phone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gGFeD.png" alt="enter image description here"  More info: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT203005
