How to set default Finder window size for *all* situations? <body> There are tons of  posts about that (like How to set default finder window size?), but none are able to change the default size emeverywhere/em, including strongshared network folders/strong from a Windows PC.  So when I open a network folder through strongFinder / Connect to Server/strong with a smb:// address, the opened Finder size is strongalways very small/strong (around 770x440 px), regardless of the "remembered" size I did with the Cmd+Resize+Relaunch trick I see everywhere.  I am on Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan), but it never worked in past OS X versions either.  <answer227462> I search a lot in codecom.apple.finder.plist/code file (under the folder code~/Library/Preferences/code) to found the answer but I can't. I think the best option to do what you want is to create an AppleScript and use it as a service with automator.  I know that is not what you want, but it's a solution to change window's size for the active window with a shortcut.  We will use the Applescript below (more about this Applescript here)  precodeon run     tell application "Finder"         activate         set bounds of front window to {0, 100, 490, 248}     end tell end run /code/pre  h2How to create the Service with Automator/h2  ol liOpen Automator and Select Service  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gPsVB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liSearch for codeAppleScript/code and double click on codeRun AppleScript/code/li liIn codeService Receives/code set to codeno input/code in codeany application/code/li liCopy the Script below and paste it in Automator img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VfWPM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liDon't forget to save your service (cmd+s) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9iG9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  h2Assign a shortcut for your service/h2  ol liGo to System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts/li liFrom the left sidebar select Services/li liFind your service and add a shortcut (e.x. cmd+shift+w) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6FN3F.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  Now open your folder, press codecmd+shift+w/code and the window's bounds will be change to code{0, 100, 490, 248}/code  More Informations about BoundsProperty, to create your own here  hr  h2Update:/h2  Here's the AppleScript to strongchoose your own width and height for the window without changing the destination from the side of the screen/strong. Just change codemyWindowWidth/code and codemyWindowHeight/code. Also I have some other variables in comment to understand the code. Please reply if you have any question!  precodeon run     tell application "Finder"         activate         --we take the bounds properties of the front window         set windowAreaDimensions to bounds of the front window         set x1 to item 1 of windowAreaDimensions         set y1 to item 2 of windowAreaDimensions         set x2 to item 3 of windowAreaDimensions         set y2 to item 4 of windowAreaDimensions          set destToLeft to x1         set destToTop to y1         --set destToRight to x2         --set destToBottom to y2         --set previousWindowWidth to destToRight - destToLeft         --set peviousWindowHeight to destToBottom - destToTop          set myWindowWidth to 730         set myWindowHeight to 521         set sameWidth to destToLeft + myWindowWidth         set sameHeight to destToTop + myWindowHeight          --The following line script return the bounds of the front window         --get the bounds of the front window          --The following line set our bounds for the front window         set bounds of front window to {destToLeft, destToTop, sameWidth, sameHeight}     end tell end run /code/pre  <comment277848> Is there a way not to change the (x, y) coordinates? Or to retrieve the current ones to reapply them? Because it's a bit annoying when you have multiple monitors, as the window always move to the same screen, regardless of which screen it was before. <comment277873> @dbernard Of course! I update my answer with new AppleScript. Just change myWindowWidth and myWindowHeight properties. <comment277913> works better now, thanks! :-) <comment277946> @dbernard I'm happy for that!
