How can I increase spotify lock screen controls duration after pause? <body> While playing Spotify on my iPod Touch I have got some controls over the player on my lock-screen.  I have to pause the player a lot and wish I could play the songs instantly after some time again. But the controls are vanishing too quickly (after couple of minutes) and I have to type login again (pressing home button twice and typing my pass-code), which is very annoying as I have to do it very oftenâ€¦  (*How) can I increase the time to let spotify show the controls over a longer period of time?  <answer278382> I do not know of a way of increasing the time that the controls remain on the screen for. However, there is a quicker way to be able to resume playing, You can swipe up from the bottom of the lock screen, and get access to the play / pause controller. You do not need to authenticate to do this.  Hope this helps.
