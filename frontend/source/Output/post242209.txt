MacBook Muted, some applications still provide sound <body> I discovered this not so long ago, when I started using Skype. I get notification sounds even though my speakers are on mute. The same thing happens with email. Suddenly there's a notification/alert sound for everything during mute.  Is there a setting where I can disable this "feature"?   <answer242227> The most likely explanation for this is that you have multiple sound output devices. When you mute, only the current output devices is muted â€” the rest are not.  The next time you hear a sound when you think you shouldn't, go to strongSound Preferences  Output/strong and check your Output devices one by one. It's almost certain that at least one of them emisn't/em muted (a headset, for example), and that's how you're hearing the mystery sound.
