prohibitory sign at login. Can't unlock disk in Disk Utillity <body> I currently run OS X El Capitan. So yesterday my keyboard stopped working and started typing the same number on the login screen. The Mac thought I forgot my password or something so when trying to reboot it asked me to decrypt my disk in FireVault to be able to continue using the Mac. So to move on with my day I typed in my password, the Mac booted and I could continue my work.  Today I wanted to upgrade to macOS Sierra. When I open the Sierra i stall it says that the FireVault encryption is in progress and I could open up settings to see the status. So I did, nothing was happening it just asked me to start the encryption so I did. It told me it would reboot and when I try to log in again I only get prompt with a prohibitory sign:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LnA2b.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So I use CMD + R to get try an repair the drive. Nothing seems to be wrong with it. So then I check to make sure it is the corrct startup disk, then it says it needs to decrypt the disk before it can determain if it's the startup disk or not. It asks me to type in my password but it doesn't accept it. Tried rebooting and doing it again, still doesn't accept it. Any idea on how I can fix this as I really don't want to lose the files.  <comment319324> The prohibit sign shows that your Mac couldn't find the system folders. https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT204156 You should enter OS X Recovery and reinstall OS X from there
