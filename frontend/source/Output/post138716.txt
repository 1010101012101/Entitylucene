/opt directory doesn't exist on OS X 10.9 <body> Just received my macbook air and discover that i can't run port command because of /opt directory not exists. Is it normal? (OS X 10.9)  <answer138717> Yes, OS X does not come with anything in /opt or even the directory itself. I presume you're looking for MacPorts, which is a 3suprd/sup-party package manager that installs codeport/code. MacPorts has to be installed separately.  Various other apps can place files in /opt though. For example, even though I've never had MacPorts, I have the /opt directory and it contains the X11 directory.  <comment163692> keep in mind that there are also other Projects like homebrew and fink. <comment163702> @konqui Homebrew hasn't put anything in my /optâ€”have you used a custom prefix? <comment163703> No i have not but i saw soe tutorials where they show how one could do. Your right by default homebrew doean't use /opt. But one can make it to use it, thats why i mentioned it.
