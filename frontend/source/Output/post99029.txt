Time capsule: Error deleting partial image <body> I have two machines backing up to a Time Capsule. On the disk there a faulty disk image which was marked as empurgeable/em but cannot be deleted:  precode2013-08-15 6:00:16.847 PM com.apple.backupd[13566]: Found 1 partially deleted backup image. 2013-08-15 6:00:26.918 PM com.apple.backupd[13566]: Failed to remove file://localhost/Volumes/Data/NAME .purgeable/, error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=512 "“NAME .purgeable” couldn’t be removed."

I would rather keep the file than losing all my old spanshots.  <comment342841> Did you ever find a resolution to this? Still a problem with MacOS Sierra in 2017. Thanks. <comment342842> @JoshPinter Sadly no. I re-initialized Time Capsule throwing away the old backups. <comment342846> Thanks for the lightning quick response, on a Sunday no less! I'm going to try a few things here, including booting up in safe mode and single user mode to see if I can delete it. I'll post back here with any updates that I find. Cheers!
