How to quick reply with Google Hangouts on iOS 10? <body> On iOS 9 I would utilize the quick reply functionality to reply to Google Hangout messages. However, since upgrading to iOS 10 I am no longer able to use quick reply as a swipe left on a Hangout notification only gives the option to clear.  Is there an iOS 10 setting that I need to enable for Hangouts to be able to quick reply? Or is this something that Google needs to change with Hangouts to accommodate iOS 10's new notification APIs?  <answer256830> This is a change that Google needs to make for their apps.  It's not something that Apple can fix inside the Google app.  Google might've moved this function or made it a 3D Touch feature, I don't know.  <answer256843> Swiping left now universally gives the option to clear notifications.  Apps that haven't been explicitly updated for iOS 10 should still reveal their current swipe options by long-pressing (iPhone 6 and earlier) or 3D touching (iPhone 6s and later) on the notification.  I just received a notification via Google Hangouts and upon 3D touching on the notification on my iPhone 7 lock screen, I got two options as seen in the first screenshot (Reply and View). Tapping Reply presented me with the quick reply screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tphkE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSm7K.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment320417> I assumed it would require a fix from Google to accommodate Apple API changes for iOS 10, but wanted to be sure I wasn't missing some obscure OS setting. <comment320430> Should and do are often different. ;-) <comment320444> Have you tried it? I just now received a notification from Google Hangouts and have updated the answer with a screenshot. <comment320455> Had not used 3D Touch. Rereading your answer I now understand what you meant. I agree that 3D Touch does work for bringing up Reply and View. Thank you for the help!
