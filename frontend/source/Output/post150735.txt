How to login to message app with different Apple IDs <body> I have several Apple IDs, so how can I login with all of these Apple IDs to iMessage on my iMac at once?  I want to send imessage from many apple ID simultaneously. By message app, I sign in my apple ID and I can use imessage.   But, if I try another apple ID, the previous apple ID will be unavailable.  Is it possible to have multiple Apple ID active at the same time?  <answer150745> Sorry, it appears that you cannot be logged into multiple accounts emat once./em You can use more than one with iMessage, but you will have to switch between them manually every time you want to use a different Apple ID. Here are a couple of questions that may help:  Multiple Apple ID in Messages.app  How to chat with multiple Apple ID's?  <comment177387> Maybe you take the time and explain what your question is and what is the problem you are facing. <comment177388> I want to send imessage from many apple ID.

Therefore, only 1 imessage is available in 1 message app. <comment177396> Can I make both apple ID online at the same time ? <comment177400> Apparently not, sorry. And sadly, I don't think there are any third-party apps for iMessage accounts. <comment177401> Any way, thank you, MattWillMarron. <comment177410> possible duplicate of [Multiple Apple ID in Messages.app](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/87062/multiple-apple-id-in-messages-app) <comment177411> I see that, but that's not the answer for me. <comment186653> This doesn't seem to work for me in Yosemite. On opening Messages, I still see only the one Apple ID I had previously used to log in to Messages. <comment186673> Yeah, it doesn't work that well. My answer kinda sucked in the first place. I will be removing it if possible.
