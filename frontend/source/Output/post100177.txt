PHP exec() with Mac ports issue <body> I'm running PHP 5.3 from Mac Ports. I'm seeing some odd behavior with "exec()" that I can't track down. Calling commands that are installed in system-standard directories work, but calling commands that are located in the Mac Ports directories stall out. Safe Mode is off.  For example, if I have something like  precode&lt;?php echo exec('ls -l /home/someguy'); ?&gt; /code/pre  or  precode&lt;?php echo exec('/usr/bin/env'); ?&gt; /code/pre  I get the expected results (assuming permissions are OK in that first example).  However, if I have something like  precode&lt;?php echo exec('/opt/local/bin/svn status /projects/worm-elevator'); ?&gt; /code/pre  the Apache process just goes into some endless loop, never returning.  When I view the process under Activity Monitor, I can see both the codehttpd/code process and the codesvn/code process. If I look to see what files/sockets they have open, there's nothing unusual in there -- except, perhaps, code/usr/lib/dyld/code.  I'm suspecting it's a dynamic library loading issue, but haven't been able to nail it down. I've tried editing code/opt/local/apache2/bin/envvars/code to set a LD_LIBRARY_PATH and/or a DYNLD_LIBRARY_PATH to no avail.  This is doubtlessly something stupidly simple, but I've run out of ideas. How can I get Apache/PHP to support commands in the Mac Ports tree?
