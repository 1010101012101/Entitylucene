Wifi slow on iPad, not on iPhone, MacBook <body> I have an iPad 2 (model A1395, iOS 9.3.5) and a iPhone 4 (iOS 10.0.2) and a Macbook (OS X El Capitan, 10.11.5). All connected to the same Wifi router.  Wifi on Macbook and iPhone is fine, while Wifi on iPad is slow.  Running HTML 5 Speed Test  ( http: // speeds . me )  precodeApologies for spaces, can't post more than 2 links with less than 10 rep points)  /code/pre  in Safari on each device i get following results:  iPhone:  Pass 1: Download 35.04 Mbps, Upload: 1.99 Mbps Latency 38 ms  Pass 2: Download 34.5 Mbps, Upload 2.05 Mbps Latency 32 ms  Pass 3: Download 28.71 Mbps Upload 0.87 Mbps Latency 38 ms  Pass 4: Download 30.53 Mbps Upload 2.08 Mbps Latency 53 ms  Pass 5: Download 35.89 Mbps Upload 1.85 Mbps Latency 38 ms  Macbook:  Pass 1: Download 32.82 Mbps Upload 2.03 Mbps Latency 25 ms  Pass 2: Download 35.83 Mbps Upload 2.01 Mbps Latency 25 ms  Pass 3: Download 35.13 Mbps Upload 2.05 Mbps Latency 23 ms  Pass 4: Download 35.56 Mbps Upload 2.07 Mbps Latency 24 ms  Pass 5: Download 35.45 Mbps Upload 1.98 Mbps Latency 25 ms  iPad  Pass 1: Download 1.33 Mbps Upload 0.64 Mbps Latency 50 ms  Pass 2: Download 4.52 Mbps Upload 2.03 Mbps Latency 51 ms  Pass 3: Download 23.46 Mbps Upload 1.82 Mbps Latency 56 ms  Pass 4: Download 14.23 Mbps Upload 1.66 Mbps Latency 48 ms  Pass 5: Download 3.09 Mbps Upload 1.71 Mbps Latency 78 ms  As one can see, iPhone and Macbook have high and consistent speeds and Latencies, while iPad has greatly varying Speeds, and, unfortunately, mostly very low.  This results in issues streaming videos, music, and even just surfing the web, on the iPad.  I have tried several things the web tells you to do:  https://www.geckoandfly.com/9439/slow-ipad-wifi-connection-reset-and-flush-dns-n etwork-cache/  precode      01 – Reset / Flush Network Cache        02 – Change DNS to Google DNS        03 – Update iOS /code/pre  http://www.iphonehacks.com/2015/09/fix-ios-9-wifi-problems.html  precode Force Restart    Forget Wi-Fi Network and Rejoin    Disable Wi-Fi Networking Services    Reset Network Settings    Set Custom DNS    Restore and Setup as new iPhone/iPad /code/pre  After last step (restore and Setup as new iPhone/iPad) i tried HTML5 Speed Test again, results are still slow.  These slow Speeds mean I can't stream music and videos on iPad, and even surfing basic websites is pretty solon this device.  All the tests were done with iPhone, iPad and Macbook beside another at a distance of about 1 meter / 3 feet from router.  Thanks!
