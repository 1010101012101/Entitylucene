Left-click in Chrome extensions unavailable <body> I use Chrome 16.0.912.75 in MacOSX 10.7.2.  A right-click on the icon of an extension will show a menu, but the left-click is unresponsive.  <comment42412> No problem. We help here each other :) Welcome to AskDifferent! <comment42540> I assume left- and right-clicking works normally everywhere else? <comment43682> My other pc also run chrome in macos 10.7.2 works fine. And my coworker's chrome has same problem. <comment48217> It happen to me as well. Have you found the solution? <comment51669> I thought it happen when macos in vm, did find solution. <comment51670> But I found out, if right click to the icon, quickly left click to the same icon, can use left click feature like this.
