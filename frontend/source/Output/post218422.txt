Safari having trouble accessing my keychain <body> On El Capitan my Safari seems to have trouble remembering my settings for keychain: when the following pops up it stays there if I click "Allow" or "Always Allow". It goes away when I click "Deny" with the obvious consequence that the key is not used and my identification fails.  Is that a know bug? What can I do to diagnose it in more details or to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XKvXW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer218428> Always Allow should add the application to the item's 'always allow' list. If it doesn't, you can try adding the application yourself.  ol liOpen the keychain in Keychain Access./li liFind and open the 'Internet password' item for GitHub./li liIn the Access Control tab, click the strong+/strong and add Safari to the list./li /ol
