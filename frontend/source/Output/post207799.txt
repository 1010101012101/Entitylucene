How do I access previous workouts recorded via Apple Watch? <body> I want to see my detailed stats about my previous run.  I tried searching for a manual - https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204523 - but I don't seem to find such option.  On this occasion I was running with Apple Watch only (no iPhone, no GPS) but if I have the outline I manually set the starting point.  But first things first - how do I access data from my previous workout?  <answer207801> There's 3rd-party apps that provide such functionality, but nothing made by Apple on the Apple Watch itself, probably due to simplicity.  <answer211282> The historical data (other than the last summary data for each activity) is available in two places by default:  ol liOn the paired iPhone - you can use the activity app to review your workouts as well as going into health app to review data./li liOn the watch itself - you can look at today's workout(s) in the Activity app, but not go back in time as of Watch OS 2.0/li /ol  <comment250772> Do you mind recommending such 3rd party apps? Digression: NSA springs to mind "let's store everything and analyse later" :) I wonder is there a reason why there is no way of viewing archived workouts? (me === monkey) <comment267441> Of course! **Activity app** on the iPhone... Thanks for sharing!
