Spotlight shows web sugggestions despite disabling it <body> I disabled spotlight suggestions like recommended on the web (e.g. here). My settings now look like this:  System Preferences: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Tahy.png" alt="System Preferenes" Safari Preferences img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2rMSm.png" alt="Safari Preferences"  However, I still get website suggestions for spotlight searches: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KnwJD.png" alt="enter image description here"  How to fix this?  <answer224667> I can't reproduce, but here are a few ideas:  ul litry to change the settings once again:  ol licheck "Allow Spotlight Suggestions in Spotlight and Look up"/li liuncheck "Spotlight suggestions" in the list/li liuncheck "Allow Spotlight Suggestions in Spotlight and Look up"/li /ol/li lidelete code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Spotlight.plist/code, reboot and configure again via System Preferences/li /ul  <answer224691> This trick is working for me with yosemite .I did unload the SpotlightNetHelper service using the terminal with this command codesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.metadata.SpotlightNetHelper.plist/code and then reboot  <comment272492> Do you have a `Spotlight Suggestions` line to select within your list on `El Capitan`? <comment272502> Yes, but only when "Allow Spotlight Suggestions in Spotlight and Look up" is checked. <comment272633> hm, I get "/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.metadata.SpotlightNetHelper.plist: Could not find specified service" when I try to run this on el capitan. The plist file exists though <comment272652> It is kind of a long shot but you can rename the app : sudo mv /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ParsecUI.framework/Versions/A/Support/SpotlightNetHelper.app /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ParsecUI.framework/Versions/A/Support/SpotlightNetHelper.app.backup <comment272656> if the .plist exist an you get "/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.metadata.SpotlightNetHelper.plist: Could not find specified service" it probably  means that the service is already unloaded you can check by loading it sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.metadata.SpotlightNetHelper.plist <comment273826> After a reboot it worked... No Idea though why id did not already work after unloading the service.
