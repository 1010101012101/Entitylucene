3 finger swipe gesture while on guest user account <body> Firstly, I have the latest OS X installed (10.11.2) and when I log in to the Mac with my administration account everything regarding the trackpad gestures works smoothly.  What impresses me is that  when I create a guest user account, then I cannot resize any window with the 3 finger swipe gesture (yes, I have checked the settings). However, if I press hard the trackpad and swipe, then it works.   Does anyone have a similar problem?  ul liI have already tried SMC/PRAM reset and deleting/disabling the account but the problem persists./li /ul  strongUPDATE/strong: This problem occurs no matter the type of account I create (i.e. even if I create an extra administration account).  <answer220696> Thank you @thanasissdr for answering your own question:  ol liTo enable 3-finger swipe on any account, go to System Preferences  Accessibility./li liOn the right, choose Mouse &amp; Trackpad./li liClick "Trackpad Options..."/li liCheck "Enable dragging" and select "three finger drag" from the drop-down list./li /ol  Here's the Apple discussion that answers this question.  <comment267123> Ok, solution found [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6996855?start=0&tstart=0), for anyone who has the same problem.
