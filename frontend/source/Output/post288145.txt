Creating space on nearly full Time Machine external backup disk <body> I know the question has been asked before but the different answers are somewhat confusing. I used the tmutil to delete several of my old backups. Some of the previous answers said you also need to run the hdiutil to compact the database. The example they gave was for a TM backup performed by a server. My backup has a different directory structure with different names.  I'm asking if I do have to run the hdiutil compact command to reclaim my drive space and if so, what file or directory do I compress. None of this was clear from previous answers.  <comment363876> Why not just let Time Machine do it's own thing? It will always recycle the older backups so it never runs out of disk space. if you start manually trimming, you are just setting yourself a task that will need repeating in another day/week/month... <comment363911> Yea good point.  Thanks.
