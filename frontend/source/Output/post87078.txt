Installing gcc47 as default using Homebrew <body> I'm trying to install gcc47 as my default compiler using homebrew.  I can successfully install gcc47, but it adds a -4.7 suffix on all of its binaries.  If I try to symlink it in /usr/local/bin things get tricky.  Consider this:  precode$ which gcc /usr/bin/gcc $ gcc --version i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00) Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

The downside is that it only works when your bashrc is used and only for your user (which could also be a positive).  <comment106089> FWIW, this works fine for me.  I don't see anything wrong with your approach in principle. <comment144555> Isn't it ~/.bash_profile? <comment144602> Yeah. I forgot I had `source .bashrc` in my `.bash_profile`
