Areca 1220 + Mac Pro <body> 3 years ago I set up my Mac Pro with an Areca RAID card and 2 drives. I want to reconfigure this, but I realized my Areca 1220 has no ethernet port -- and I have no idea how I got to the MRAID interface.   (I previously did this with a different Areca card with an ethernet port by finding it's IP address -- I have no idea where to start without the RAID card's IP address)   HELP  Also I cannot create a tag "Areca"
