Unable to symlink /Users in OS X El Capitan <body> I#m running OS X El Capitan and want to symlink /Users to /home  codesudo ln -sf /Users /home/code  fails with     ln: home/Users: Operation not supported   Why does this fail?  Could this be related to other OS X restrictions? Such as when trying to write to /usr/share ...     Operation not permitted   <answer228031> Likely System Integrity Protection?  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899  You can disable it and verify this I suppose.  <answer228036> System Integrity Protection strongdoesn't/strong prevent you creating sym links in / because the root of the file system is strongnot/strong protected!  But the root of the OS X file system already contains an invisible volume/mount point emhome/em created by /etc/auto_master (and /etc/auto_home). Your intension to create an equally named sym link there conflicts with this and is therefore forbidden.  Network users who login to the local machine will have their home directories mounted in /home according to the details in /etc/auto_home.  <comment277951> http://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-how-to-disable-system-integrity-protection/ <comment277952> followed the instructions at http://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-how-to-disable-system-integrity-protection/, "csrutil disable" command reports success. however, the symlink creation still fails w/ the same message.
