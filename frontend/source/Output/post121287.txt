So it's OK to get it from another country like the Philippines.  Warranty is worldwide. The software language you will choose on first use, and you can change it later.  The only real difference is for products with keyboards (iMac, MacBook, etc), obviously then it will influence your keyboard layout (QWERTY, AZERTY etc.).  <answer121301> Yes those are Model Regions, You can check the numbers here As the site states: codeIt is not possible to see to what carrier the phone is locked (or not) by just looking at the model number, but it gives you an idea where the phone was intended to be sold./code  Summarized for you:  ol liZP = Hong Kong, Macau and/li liLL= USA/li /ol  <comment141365> thank you, it mean there isn't any difference in build quality? <comment141366> It's still an Apple product, so it should be the same. <comment141369> Why that list haven't EA-Spain?! <comment141370> thank you, it mean there isn't any difference in build quality? <comment141372> Not as far as I know.
