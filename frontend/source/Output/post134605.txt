Cannot uninstall Comodo AV from 2014 iMac <body> iMac:  strongemMay 2014, 27" iMac, 3.2GHz Quad-core Intel Core i5,  16GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM - 2X8GB 1TB Serial ATA Drive @ 7200 rpm NVIDIA GeForce GT 755M 1 GB GDDR5/em/strong  I have tried using the uninstaller that came with Comodo to uninstall it, I have also tried using different uninstallers,e.g App Cleaner, Uninstaller,  the most recent was EasyFind. I know it has not completely uninstalled when I attempt to install a different AV on it like, Avast, and I receive a message, that states Comodo prevented Avast AV from installing.   I have never had problems with uninstalling this program from a Mac, perhaps it is Mavericks, 10.9.3  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank You  OS
