How can I convert .CR2 to .jpg? <body> Is there a simple tool that will convert .cr2 files (Canon RAW) to .jpg?   I know Preview does it well but I'm looking for something directly accessible from the contextual menu.   <answer76399> You can make a custom workflow to do this as a Finder (or even system wide) service using Automator.  Look for the strongChange Type of Images/strong action under Photos and then you just need to decide on your workflow - whether you save this as a service that can be activated by the contextual menu or perhaps make it into a drop folder so you can automate the next step of the process as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OfIp9.png" alt="Automator showing picture conversion action"  <comment88612> Err, @bmike, according to the description this doesn't work with RAW. <comment88616> I could have sworn it used to work with RAW despite it not being listed - RAW support is a pain point and if they listed RAW, lots of edge case formats would fail. Lemme dig a bit to see if I can be sure CR2 from canon will work seamlessly... There will be a tool, perhaps automator, but I better check. If you want to post a CR2 sample file (I'm a nikon guy mostly) - I'd test it for you... <comment88617> I rest my case, it does work with Canon RAW as input. <comment88619> It Works great ! I just can't find how I convert the file in the same folder without replacing it. <comment88625> Just got it. I used "Duplicate file" before converting it. Thx again ! <comment193372> Just an update, tried it now and it does work with cr2 files.
