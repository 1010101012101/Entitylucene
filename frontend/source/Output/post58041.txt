Is there some way to sync only Reminders to iCloud? <body> Under Mountain Lion, syncing Reminders to iCloud is linked to syncing Calendars for some reason:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CgOrQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  In contrast, under iOS (version 5), you're able to sync Reminders to iCloud separately:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3ZwA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I sync my Calendars to a Google Calendar, and my Reminders to iCloud on my iOS devices.  However, in Mountain Lion, this doesn't seem to be possible.  h3Is there some workaround to the limitation in the preference pane in OS X?/h3  <answer58067> Yes you can. Just add your google account from System Preferences as usual. Then open iCal  Preferences  Accounts  iCloud and untick "Enable this account"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5UEBZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer58370> I, too, would very much like the OSX Reminders to be sync'd with iCloud separately from Calendar (I, too, sync my Calendar with Google Calendars).  In testing out Keen's response, I found that if I leave my OSX Calendar enabled in iCloud, then look in OSX Reminders, I see all the same tasks as on my iOS devices. On my OSX Reminders, I added a task to one of the iCloud lists. Then, once again, disabled the iCloud Calendar account. Now, when I look at my iOS device, the task I added while on my Mac is there (and alerted me on my iOS device at the appropriate time).   So, temporarily enabling the OSX Calendar/Reminders sync with iCloud is a work-around...certainly not pretty, but do-able...until Apple improves OSX to separate the Reminders iCloud sync from the Calendar iCloud sync.  <answer60107> This works.. one more thing to make it safe - i.e. to retain your google calendar without a fuss..  ul listrongDisable WIFI or unplug your Ethernet cable/strong/li lienable Reminders &amp; Calendar in the Cloud Setting in Mountain Lion/li liOpen iCal, and iCal will attempt to Sync w/ iCloud and will eventually timeout/li liclick "Try Again Later"/li liIn iCal go to Preferences  Accounts  iCloud and untick "Enable this account"/li liEnable your WIFI/plug in your Ethernat cable/li /ul  <comment66936> This didn't work.  Reminders isn't pulling down my iCloud Reminders. <comment69208> Additional note.. everything seems to be setup, but the reminders are still not syncing w/ iCloud. However the Google Calendar is still syncing as normal.. <comment88627> @Keen, make sure Calendars & Reminders is still checked. <comment166945> FWIW, this is not an issue in Mavericks. <comment202737> Unfortunately it's a hidden issue in Mavericks. Though Apple gives separate tickboxes for Calendars and Reminders, it still syncs them together or not at all.
