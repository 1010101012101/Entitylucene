Two variables contain the same AppleScript object, yet they are not equal, why? <body> I don't understand:  precodetell application "Mail" set A to first mailbox of first account set B to every mailbox of first account set C to first item of B  log C is A -- returns true, as expected  repeat with D in B     log D is A -- returns false, WHY?!     exit repeat end repeat  end tell /code/pre  I cannot make sense of these results, especially since I'm getting:  precodelog D -- returns "mailbox INBOX of account id E7992E19-9A74-418D-BEBB-5F46C8A3E776" log A -- returns "mailbox INBOX of account id E7992E19-9A74-418D-BEBB-5F46C8A3E776" log class of A -- returns "container" log class of D -- returns "container" /code/pre  What makes A not equal to D?  <comment341514> In that form of repeat statement, loop variable is a reference to an item in a list and not the item itself, so D contains **item 1 of {mailbox x of .., mailbox y of .., ...}**, not the **mailbox x of ....** object. To get a good result with a reference, use `contents of`, like this --  `log (contents of D is A) -- returns true` <comment341542> @jackjr300, You should post your comment as an answer so it can be up-voted, so as to add to your reputation.
