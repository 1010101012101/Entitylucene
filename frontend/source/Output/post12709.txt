How can I convert JPG into PDF easily? <body> Is there any way to batch convert .jpg files into single .pdf files?  <answer12710> Never forget your little fellow Automator, sitting in a hard drive near you :)  Launch Automator, create a new workflow. Now you need to add two actions:  ol liIn the "Files &amp; Folders" select emAsk for Finder Items/em and drag it. /li liIn the PDFs Category, find "New PDF from Images" and also drag it./li /ol  Your workflow should look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQEg0.jpg" alt="AutomatorFlow"  Now read the options for each emAction/em and customize accordingly. Investigate similar actions (especially in the Files &amp; Folders category) and perhaps the Photos if you want to transform your images from JPG to something else. In fact, go ahead and look all over automator, there are a lot of interesting things there. :)  When you're satisfied with your Workflow, click "Run" on the top right corner. Watch the magic happens and depending upon the number of items and your CPU power, you might go grab a coffee/tea.  <answer75448> I don't know if this works with .jpg files but the easiest way I know to convert text is to select print in the file menu, then in the lower left of the print menu select save as PDF.  <answer162676> I'm more at ease with commandline tools myself. ImageMagick is great for this. You can install IM through Homebrew:  precodebrew install imagemagick /code/pre  After that you can simply do this in a Terminal:  precodeconvert *.jpg output.pdf /code/pre  and if the resulting PDF is a bit too big you can try:  precodeconvert -quality 60 *.jpg output.pdf /code/pre  Of course ImageMagick also works on other Unix systems, and even on cygwin.  <comment13325> First sentence alone deserves the +1! <comment13334> This is a dupe question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11163/how-do-i-combine-two-or-more-images-to-get-a-single-pdf-file/11169#11169 <comment46700> it does only generate a single pdf which contains all pictures stored in the folder. How to create a single pdf of each picture file in the folder? Regards Chris <comment56086> @chris that would mean a new automator workflow, post a new question :) <comment199975> Great answer...thanks <comment200853> @user19087 `brew install imagemagick` and then do something like `for pic in *.jpg; do convert $pic $pic.pdf; done` <comment249794> automator you say... I did not know how useful that tool was until now! <comment334627> In case PDF is generated with rotated images, use `convert -quality 60 -rotate 90 *.jpg output.pdf`
