Getting per-user websites working on Mountain Lion server <body> I followed the instructions at this question but I am getting 404s when trying to access codehttp://localhost/~user/code.  The httpd error log shows the following message:  precode[Tue Jul 23 20:34:34 2013] [error] [client ::1] File does not exist: /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default/~user /code/pre  The userdir module is being loaded, and the codeInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf/code line is not commented out.  If I put a deliberate error in /etc/apache2/users/user.conf, codeapachectl configtest/code will fail, so it is reading this file — which means /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf is fine as well.  Without the error, user.conf reads  precode&lt;Directory "/Users/user/Sites/"&gt;     Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymlinks     AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit     Order allow,deny     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  and httpd-userdif.conf reads  precode# Settings for user home directories # # Required module: mod_userdir  # # UserDir: The name of the directory that is appended onto a user's home # directory if a ~user request is received.  Note that you must also set # the default access control for these directories, as in the example below. # UserDir Sites  # # Users might not be in /Users/*/Sites, so use user-specific config files. # Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf &lt;IfModule bonjour_module&gt;        RegisterUserSite customized-users &lt;/IfModule&gt; /code/pre  Does anybody have any idea what could be going wrong here? (And also, why Apple didn't just leave well alone and have this working by default, like it did in earlier versions of OS X? :)  strongEdit:/strong Interestingly, if I change codeUserdir Sites/code to codeUserdir /Users/*/STUFF/code I still get the same error message, with the original path — so Apache seems to be ignoring this line entirely. Sometimes I think we'd be better off with a slide rule.  <answer97779> Looks like the answer is MAMP and saving £14 on OS X Server next time around.  I'll leave the question open in case anybody can work out what Apple have done in the quest to drool-proof the Server setup, though…  <answer113782> I also had this problem, and (after only a few hours of head-to-desk impact) found the answer here on AD, from 16 months ago.  Apache 2 `UserDir` problem in OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) Server after upgrade from Lion (10.7)  If you look at code/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code and your codeDocumentRoot/code is code/Library/WebServer/Documents//code, you might not notice that the error you're getting is about a codeDocumentRoot/code with a subtly different name.  code/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/httpd_server_app.conf/code refers to serving stuff out of code/Library/Server/Web/Data//code, which corresponds the server you seem to be running.  You (like me) may be a bit surprised about that. It would've been nice for the strongServer.app/strong install to drop a helpful README in code/etc/apache2/code.  You wisely tested that you had the correct config directory, but were thwarted -- codehttpd_server_app.conf/code code#include/codes a bunch of files from code/etc/apache2/extra//code.  <comment114760> Does the user `user` exist on your system? And did you restart Apache after doing the config changes? <comment114762> It works as documented in the answer referenced from your question for other users, so let's try to figure out what needs to be fixed in your setup to get it to work as well. MAPM/OS X Server are definitively not needed to serve static web pages from a user account. <comment114913> Yes, the user is question is the one I was logged in as (I just changed the username to `user` here). I ran `sudo apachectl restart` each time. Do I need to restart through `launchctl` on OS X Server, perhaps? <comment114917> I assume you are using Apache as delivered with OS X. It works for me with the snippets from above, hmm. Is `/Users/user/Sites` on the local disk? PS: To restart I usually run `launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist; launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist` <comment135843> Thanks! OS X Server's well-documented configuration files strike again...
