OSX server & Squid : wrong keyboard region <body> Since I installed Squid and OSX server, I have very strange behaviour, a few seconds after the boot, the keyboard mapping change.  When I check in preference system I still have my Irish keyboard, tried to change for a British one, but whatever I type with it, I have a weird greek letter.  Then when I restart it's working again for a few seconds  <comment338042> For now, using a remote control from a another Mac is working.
