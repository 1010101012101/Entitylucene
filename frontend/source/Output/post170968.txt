Retina Macbook Pro doesn't hibernate <body> I have bought a 13 Retina Macbook Pro -my first Mac, just a couple of days ago and I found something odd.  Apple claims that after an hour or so of sleep, the Mac should go to deep sleep -AKA hibernation. Well, yesterday night I closed the lid and the Mac entered sleep mode. The expected behaviour according to Apple is that when I wake up in the morning, the Mac would turn on and load the RAM image from disk back to the main memory, taking many seconds to wake up. Instead, it woke up immediately -like if it never entered hibernation.  1) Why doesn't my MBP do what Apple claim it should do when "sleeping"?  2) I'd like to have the hibernation mode active. I love that my computer turns on sooo quickly but if I'm not going to use it for many hours, I'd prefer to save battery with a (slightly slower) boot.  I already tried to change the codestandbydelay/code and the codeautopoweroffdelay/code to little numbers like 1 minute, 2 minutes, 0 minutes, 120 seconds, 60 seconds (codestandbydelay/code uses seconds, codeautopoweroffdelay/code minutes according to codepmset/code man).   I don't have any USB connected, I turned off iCloud and Google sync.   I saw the codepmset -g/code assertions to see if there's some daemon or app or service preventing the deep sleep. I changed the codehibernatemode/code from 3 to 25, and back to 3.  And yes, I read the codepmset/code man and tried virtually everything I read on the web.  The Mac keeps entering sleep but never deep sleep/hibernation.  I tested everything. I'd like to have more control (or SOME control) over when and how MY computer goes to sleep/hibernate.   <answer229797> Since you did not post your codepmset -g/code power profile, we can't be sure if it is set right.  First, codeautopoweroff/code specifically says it does not work if on battery power. Sure, that's dumb and contrary to common sense, but that's European power laws.  The correct setting is codestandby/code:  From 10.10.5's man page:     STANDBY ARGUMENTSbr   strongstandby/strong causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power while asleep. This setting strongdefaults/strong to strongON/strong for supported hardware. The setting strongstandby/strong will be visible in codepmset -g/code if the feature is supported on this machine.      strongstandby/strong only works if stronghibernation/strong is turned on to hibernatemode 3 or 25.      strongstandbydelay/strong specifies the delay, in seconds, before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for Standby.   On my Macbook Pro, for some reason, it's:  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1* AC Power        -1 Currently in use:  standbydelay         4200  standby              0  halfdim              1  sms                  1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  disksleep            10  sleep                10  hibernatemode        3  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         3  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  Notice codeStandby/code is set to 0. It should be changed to 1 to turn the feature on.  codepmset -a standby 1/code  <comment230040> http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/161799  Take a look at this solution.
