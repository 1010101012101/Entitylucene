Did Apple get rid of autosave and versions in Mavericks? <body> sup(As a heads up, I've hardly used any versions of OS X newer than Snow Leopard. So, I might be missing something obvious here)./sup  I recently installed Mountain Lion and after that Mavericks. While on Mountain Lion, I noticed the "new" versions and autosave feature (released in Lion, right?) that you could access via the context menu of a file in Finder or the arrow next to the file's app's window title.  But, now that I'm in Mavericks, I can't find it in either of these places.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KENeY.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C9dGA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer135254> I can't seem to find a way to play with versions via Finder, but I emam/em able to use the codeFile &gt;&gt; Revert To &gt;&gt; .../code menu with a file open in the relevant application.  It appears that (on my machine at least) versions are integrated with Time Machine backups, so your mileage may vary.  <answer135626> Versions is not in Finder's context menu in Mavericks and later. Apple recommends the use of the File menu to access versions of files.     strongBrowse, restore, duplicate, and delete versions/strong      ol   liOpen the document, then choose File  Revert To  Browse All Versions./li   liClick tick marks along the timeline to browse versions./li   liDisplay the version you want, then do one of the following:      ul   liTo restore your document to this version, click Restore./li   liTo duplicate this version in a new document, press the Option key and click “Restore a Copy.”/li   liTo leave your document as is, without changes, click Done./li   /ul/li   /ol   supSource: OS X Mavericks: View and restore past versions of documents/sup  Documents can be reverted again using the File menu.     strongRevert a document to the last opened version/strong      Choose File  Revert To, then choose Last Opened, Last Saved, or Previous Save.   supSource: OS X Mavericks: View and restore past versions of documents/sup  Access to versions through the disclosure triangle icon next to the name of the document in the title bar is also gone—again, the File menu is preferred.  <comment160752> Interesting. I have the same thing but it's only in certain apps like Preview and TextEdit. And, I don't have Time Machine setup. <comment160762> Versions have never been integrated with Time Machine: *"With an interface similar to that of Time Machine, Versions shows you…"* <comment161308> Parfait. Thank you.
