How to unload com.adobe.AAM.Updater-1.0.plist <body> I've managed to successfully remove almost all elements of Adobe software I don't want. The only thing that remains is com.adobe.AAM.Updater-1.0.plist. I have updates disabled and Creative Cloud uninstalled. In sudo launchctl list com.adobe.AAM.Updater does not show up, in fact nothing from adobe shows up in the list. However, in ~/Library/LaunchAgents it is there. When I rut EtreCheck it says it is loaded but not running. I've tried sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AAM.Updater-1.0.plist but that doesn't work and neither does the same with ~/Library... Is there a way to prevent that .plist from loading? If I delete the .plist directly it gets removed but when I run photoshop it shows up again on restart. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.  <comment352251> Actually, the only other thing that remains is com.adobe.AAM.scheduler-1.0 under launchtl list which seems to be related. Also, it seems that Bridge is the program that "re-spawns" these files immediately, not photoshop. If I delete com.adobe.AAM.Updater-1.0.plist from ~/Library/LaunchAgents and the AAM folder from Application Support/Adobe.. they are both recreated when running Bridge, perhaps other Adobe apps will do this too, not sure. How do these programs do this? <comment352259> Some Adobe apps have built-in functions to recreate these .plist files because they think they need them, and there's not much you can do but trick them. Delete them again, then use the Terminal command `touch` (you may need to preface with sudo) to recreate a blank file the same name as the .plist file in the location they reside. Next, use the `chown` Terminal command, or the Finder **Get Info** command, and lock the file, which prevents it from being re-written. When the LaunchAgent process runs at the next restart, it'll read an empty file and not be able to launch anything. <comment352504> IconDaemon - I see. So basically I'm just taking the .plist that it's ~/Library/LaunchAgents, creating a .plist file that is completely empty, then locking the file so no changes can be made to it? Can I just edit the .plist file that is there, delete everything in it, save it, lock it and leave it like that? <comment352541> That should work, too. <comment352542> I'll give it a shot, and thank you for your help, much appreciated.
