Photos on iPhone eating up space <body> I have a large photo library on my 16GB iPhone (20,000 photos, mostly of cats...), and 120GB free space on iCloud (60GB is taken up by my photos). I have 900MB free space on my phone.  Despite the 'Optimise Storage' option being turned on, it appears that Photos is keeping high-resolution originals of my photos in my almost depleted phone memory - taking up way more space than should be taken up by 20,000 tiny thumbnails.  Is there a way to stop it from doing this at all, forcing it to free up space on my phone? Or am I locked into Apple's mysterious machinations with my storage?
