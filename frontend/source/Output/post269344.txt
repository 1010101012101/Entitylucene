USB keyboard and USB mouse with Mac mini <body> I was told by the salesman that I cannot use USB keyboard and mouse with my Mac mini, so I have to use wireless keyboard and mouse.  Is there anything I can do to use USB keyboard/mouse?  Edit :  In this question below I learned that its possible to use USB keyboard/mouse with Mac mini.  I have contacted Apple and learned that my Mac mini, supports USB keyboard and mouse.  <answer269347> I use USB keyboards and mice with my Mac minis by plugging them into the USB ports on the rear of the Mac mini.  <answer269348> Apple's Mac mini is the "budget" line of computers and actually emdoes not/em come with a mouse and keyboard and instead, Apple tells you to "bring your own".  From the current (2017) product page on Apple.com:     Mac mini is an affordable powerhouse that packs the entire Mac   experience into a 7.7-inch-square frame. strongJust connect your own   display, keyboard, and mouse/strong, and youâ€™re ready to make big things   happen.   Nowhere on Apple's site does it state that it "only works with wireless keyboards."  Going all the way to the other end of the timeline, MacWorld.com has an article from 2005 that reviews the Mac mini.  In it, it states:     Apple touts the Mac mini as being compatible with any USB keyboard...   strongemIf you cannot use a USB mouse and/or keyboard on your Mac mini, it's time to do some diagnostics to see if those USB ports are functional./em/strong  <comment338333> Mac Minis have USB ports in the back. <comment338334> Yeah, but its work only for wireless <comment338335> meaning the usb ports are dead? <comment338336> I have updated question - As far as I know, we cannot use USB keyboard and USB mouse on a Mac Mini - wireless is forced. <comment338337> that doesn't seem right. <comment338338> Why? Do you use Mac Mini with USB keyboard/mouse? My seller said me like this, when I'm buying it <comment338340> i used to support macs. it sounds like you got scammed. <comment338341> Hmm okey thanks, I will search this. <comment338344> Where did you buy this?  It must be broken already. <comment338347> Hm okey I didn't know that it was possible. So it seems I'm scammed.. <comment338351> I buyed it from a supermarket. <comment338362> @mrbengi "Scammed"? Do you mean just given bad advice? <comment338374> No, my seller have said that I cannot use USB keyboard/mouse. But normally, you can trust him. So in fact, my Mac Mini model may not support it... <comment338428> @mrbengi  Are you saying that you have never tried plugging in a usb keyboard or mouse yet? <comment338511> @mrbengi There are no Mac Mini models that lack support for a USB keyboard and mouse. <comment338553> @Tom I had tried plugging with USB and it doesn't work with model A1347 that I used. <comment338563> @mrbengi  So I guess you have a broken mini.  You can either try to return it and buy a good one instead, or try to see if it can be repaired.  I have no idea if repair would be possible, better to get a good one if you need usb. <comment338686> @mrbengi it's also possible you have a faulty keyboard. But model A1347 is being sold with a USB keyboard here: https://www.amazon.com/Apple-A1347-MC270LL-Intel-320GB/dp/B00AJMDVSW for example.
