Is Mac OS X's Compress a "standard" zip? <body> When I submit my research papers to an online review system, I prefer to upload all files (manuscript, figures, etc) by a single zip file, so that the review system can unzip the file. Otherwise, I have to upload many files one by one; time-consuming.  However, if I create a zip file using the Mac OS X's native Compress functionality, the review system tells it may be a corrupt file. Every time I try, it does same.  Instead if I use codezip/code command in Terminal to create a zip file, it is fine.  What kind of zip technology does Compress use? Anything non-standard? Do you see any potential reasons for the fails?  <answer63409> As its codeman/code page states,     The compress utility reduces the size of files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding.   In contrast, the codezip/code command (also present in Mac OS X, at least in Mountain Lion) uses a different algorithm. If a publisher is expecting a codezip/code-compressed file, a file compressed with codecompress/code is something different, and will not work for this.  <comment73312> Another difference is: the Mac compressed zip contains some .DS_Store files and possibly other files invisible on the Mac but not invisible in Windows.
