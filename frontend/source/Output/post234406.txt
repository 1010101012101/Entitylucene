How do I mark all podcast episodes as played in iOS10? <body> I tried looking this up but there are only examples for previous versions of iOS where there was an option in the podcast settings called "mark all as played".  This option is not there anymore. Is it gone forever?  <answer282008> strongMarking all podcasts as played/strong  This feature was originally removed sometime during iOS 7 (I think iOS 7.1, but am not certain on this).  Just in case you're not aware, the closest option to doing this within the builtin Podcasts app is to do as follows:  ol liLaunch the Podcasts app/li liTap on My Podcasts/li liTap on the Podcast series you want to mark as played/li liTap on Edit (located at top right corner)/li liNow tap on the radio buttons on the left of each episode/li liTap on the Mark option at bottom left/li liSelect the emMark as Played/em option/li /ol  This will mark all your selected podcasts as played.  Of course, you can also use iTunes to mark them all as played and then sync your iPhone, but that may only be quicker overall if you wanted to mark multiple series of podcasts as played. Otherwise the above steps will most likely be more convenient - although certainly not as convenient as the older emMark all as Played/em option in earlier generations of iOS.  strongGone forever?/strong  In terms of whether this feature is emgone forever/em, no-one here (or even at Apple) can answer that. There's no telling what may or may not happen with the Podcasts app in future.  strongAlternatives/strong Finally, there are a number of very popular third party podcast apps which many users have turned to. It may be worth you investigating some of these to see if they're suitable for your needs. I list a few below (some are free, others aren't):  ul liOvercast/li liPocket Casts/li liDowncast/li liiCatcher! Podcast player/li liPod Wrangler/li /ul  strongNote:/strong I am not affiliated with any of the above apps in any way.
