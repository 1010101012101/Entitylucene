Disable chat room notifications for OSX Messages? <body> In the Mountain Lion Messages app, is there a way to disable notifications for emchat room/em messages, but still have notifications for private messages? (this is the default behavior in Adium)  <answer112039> With the chatroom thread selected, uncheck strongUse Alerts in this Conversation/strong from the strongView/strong menu.  The is the best solution I've found (only disables notifications on a per thread basis).  I haven't found a global setting that disables notifications for all chatrooms.  supI found the solution from this answer on "How do I temporarily disable or mute Messages (iMessage) on OS X?"/sup
