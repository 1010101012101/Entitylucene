How do I find out what serif font is being used in the Day One mac app? <body> I use the Day One regularly and love it. I also write a lot (for work) and have found that Day One serif font and style making writing such a pleasure. I'd like to use the font in my other word processors (particularly Scrivener) and am willing to purchase it but can't figure out what it is. How would I go about finding out what it is?  ul liI've emailed the app author but got no response from him./li liI've poked around the codeContents/Resources/code folder in the application but only found a fixed-with font. /li liHere is a screenshot (but I can't imagine that's very helpful). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/If7zR.png" alt="enter image description here" I appreciate any leads./li /ul  <answer54743> This application on the web helped me out a couple of times:  http://www.whatfontis.com/  Just take a screenshot of some words which are typed with a particular font (preferably with a big size) and upload the screenshot.  I am not affiliated with the site in any way, I'm just a satisfied user. Give it a try. Otherwise you could try to mail the developers of Day One.  <answer104231> I was looking for the main Sans font. which is probably Avenir  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/   https://dayone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200145945-The-Day-One-main-window-goes-blank  <answer131652> It's called "Anonymous Pro" on the iPhone app  <answer131681> It's either Hoefler Text or Baskerville. Check Preferences  Appearance to see which one is selected. I think both of them come with OS X, so you shouldn't have to buy anything.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DF1FF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment62705> I don't have a technical technique you can use to determine which font is used in the app, but it looks to me like it's Baskerville, which is included with OS X. <comment62706> and so it is! Thanks very much @joelseph
