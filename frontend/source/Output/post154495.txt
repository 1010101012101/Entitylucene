Correct Filesystem Setup? <body> Recently I did a fresh install of OSX Yosemite on my Macbook Pro.  I followed these instructions to create a USB install drive, and I then used the Disk Utility app from that booted USB drive to erase the Machintosh HD and then install the OS.  I just tried out diskutil list and I found that there's two different disks mounted which I don't recall seeing before I updated. Looking online I couldn't find any similar setups like this. Is this normal or did the tutorial I followed mess something up?  precodeJordans-Computer:~ jordan$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         749.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *748.9 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  A0A847DD-F842-4411-975F-CAA359CF6917                                  Unencrypted Jordans-Computer:~ jordan$  /code/pre  Thanks  <comment181771> Absolutely normal. Nothing to worry about.
