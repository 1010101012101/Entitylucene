Turn on a iOS hotspot without 3G connection <body> Is it possible to turn on my hotspot on my iPhone 5s (running iOS 8) without wifi or 3G connection? I would like people to connect to my network to play LAN games while overseas. However, I do not want to turn on my 3G so as to save money from the data charges. Is there any way to turn on your hotspot while your 3G/4G is off without jailbreaking?  <answer158750> In short, No.  The iPhone's hotspot only works with your carrier, 3G, 4G etc, it doesn't operate over Wifi.  I've never Jailbroken, so I don't know if that would help.  <comment186615> You CAN do this with a machine running OS X.
