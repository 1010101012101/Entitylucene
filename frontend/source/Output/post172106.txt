show Apple ID or Email on iMessage <body> How can you change the phone Nr. from showing up on iMessage? I'd rather have it changed to my email or Apple ID instead.  <answer172201> You can go to Settings app  Messages  Send &amp; Receive, and at the bottom under "Start New Conversations From" change it to your preferred option. Your email address and phone number will both appear there.  <comment202719> Your Apple ID **is** your email address. <comment202730> @tubedogg It is possible to have a primary email address that is different from your apple ID, in addition to alternate emails. <comment202748> @NReilingh By definition an Apple ID is an email address. Whether it is your primary email or not, it is your email address.
