How can I troubleshoot keyboard shortcuts that are not working? <body> Within system preferences -- keyboard -- shortcuts -- mission control I have the following shortcut set:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZoZR.png" alt="enter image description here"  I record the shortcut by hitting kbdControl/kbdkbd5/kbd, but when I play the shortcut back, I am not able to actually move to that space.  When showing my desktops I see that I have Desktops 1-5 as well.  How can I troubleshoot why this specific shortcut is not working? I have a similar shortcut for kbdControl/kbdkbd4/kbd to move to Desktop 4, which does work.  This feels like a trivial problem but I do not know how to actually investigate much. I have used an application called Karabiner to verify the OS is processing the keystrokes correctly:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5BPgR.png" alt="enter image description here"  But the shortcut does not move me to Desktop 5.  <comment311924> Does _anything_ happen when you use Control+5? It's probably conflicting with another shortcut somewhere, though it's usually pretty good about notifying you to conflicts. <comment311926> Do you have a 10-key [num-pad] or a 'short' keyboard? 10-key's numbers  are recognised differently to the ones above qwerty. By default, the shortcuts assigned to Spaces are the qwerty ones. <comment311932> No and no. Interestingly, my system helpfully restarted for other reasons and the issue went away... :\
