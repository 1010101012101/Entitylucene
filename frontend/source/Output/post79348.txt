How do I run Gimp on Mountain Lion? <body> I recently upgraded to Mountain Lion and tried to open GIMP.  To my dismay my computer asked me where X11 was.  How do I find X11 and run GIMP?  <answer79349> Apple decided not to include X11 in Mountain Lion: Apple Support Article  But there is now a native version of GIMP for mountain lion which requires no X11: Gimp Downloads   However, if you need to run the old version of GIMP you can download xquartz as mentioned in the apple support document linked above.  When you try to run GIMP again, you can find Xquartz in    code/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/code  Enjoy GIMP!  <answer79359> The X11 Gimp is actually quite misbehaved on OS X, to the point of being almost totally unusable. But despair not; there is a native Gimp version that doesn't require X11. You can find it on the Gimp download page.  <answer79370> Here http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html you can download a native GIMP 2.8.2 and also the docs. No X11 is required.  <comment91650> Actually, once you have Xquartz installed, you usually don't even need to know where it is, since it gets launched automagically whenever some X11 program runs. <comment91677> @HaraldHanche-Olsen included that because my computer prompted me for the location of X11 <comment138012> Not available at your linked page anymore it seems <comment138016> @NicolasRaoul There does seem to be native Gimp 2.8 for OS X there, though I didn't actually try to download it. But it showed up after a short delay; perhaps the server does some browser sniffing, maybe even some javascript magic, before you get to see the downloads? Perhaps you could try a different browser and see if you get a different result. <comment138123> Indeed! Browsing from Ubuntu I am only shown Linux/BSD/Solaris downloads. I should have spot the "Other downloads" link, sorry!
