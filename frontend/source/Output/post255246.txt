keyboard keeps resetting itself to U.S <body> I have a British keyboard which I have set in my keyboard preferences, however my mac keeps resetting itself back to U.S.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5sKqM.png" alt="enter image description here"  This annoying feature happens about 5 to 10 times a day.  How can I permanently set the language?  <answer255249> Please check in your keyboard preferences whether you have more than one language setting. If so remove the unwanted language.  Also check In system settings - Language &amp; Region whether are more than one language is setting. Remove all unless your main language.  Test if works.  <answer255250> The default key command to switch Input Sources is kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd space /kbd which you may be triggering accidentally.br From comments, I understand the new default since El Capitan is kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd space /kbd, however it also appears it will remain at the old setting if you upgraded from an older OS.  To remove unwanted input sources go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Input Sources &amp; remove all except the one you wish to keep.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4WNLn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, if you want to keep the other sources but not trigger them accidentally, then remove the shortcuts in System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Input Sources. [This option is only visible if you have more than one source in the previous pref pane.]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lipmx.png" alt="enter image description here"  With the key command to change sources removed, you can change from the menu bar flag.    If you remove all except one source, the flag icon will disappear.  <comment317883> Starting with El Capitan the default is actually Control plus Space (as also in iOS 9).  But I think some users wind up with Command plus Space via their upgrading process.... <comment317895> Ah, OK. Thanks Tom - mine is probably legacy; long series of in-place upgrades. I'll add it to the answer.
