Can Apple Watch read aloud web sites or web pages? <body> I know that Apple Watch comes with Siri, which is capable of understanding spoken phrases and respond with a short answer.  But can it also read an entire website or web page, similar to Android apps like Culinary Pal or Wiki Pal?  <comment213826> did you try it? <comment213829> @Buscar웃 On the Apple Watch I did not try it because I did not buy one yet. On the Android I tried it and it is very impressive. <comment213831> AFIK Apple Watch needs iPhone to access Internet. So reading on iPhone is a piece of cake. <comment213880> @Buscar웃 I have an iPhone and so far I have not been able to find in the AppStore any app like [Culinary Pal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yizri.voculinary). That's why I am asking. I have been waiting for Apple to come up with something like this. If the Apple Watch has the ability to navigate through and read *any* web site, I will buy it. But from your answer I understand that it doesn't. Please correct if I am mistaken. Thank you.
