How to hide audio volume pop over? <body> How can I disable/hide this automatic volume level pop over that appears when changing the sound level. Is there switch or secret flag to not show this when I change the volume using the volume keys on the keyboard (Macbook)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r656X.png" alt="Audio Level Setting"  <answer131836> I found an answer here  Basically it is going to      /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/BezelUI/HiDPI/.    You'll see there a lot of pdf-pictures, one of them codevolume.pdf/code. You'll want to overwrite that one (backup the old one!) with an empty code.pdf/code. You can also overwrite the codemute.pdf/code, but I dont think that is necessary in movies.  When you open this PDF in Preview, you will see a white square, by default, Preview will show transparency as 'white'. As the illustration is white, and the transparency is white, you will see a white square instead of the white volume logo. You can turn the white transparency off. Go to View, Show Image Background (kbdAlt/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdB/kbd)  <comment154934> In case you are curious about this, like me, and open a file here in Preview and see just a blank white file... Well it seems that Preview must show all PDFs with a white background, and as the content is white... So you need to open it in something other that Preview. <comment154936> @SteveChambers You can set the preview background in the Preview Preferences (Command , ) under General; Window Background. And you can turn On and Off the transparency in the main menu bar, go to View, Show Document Background (Alt-Command-B)
