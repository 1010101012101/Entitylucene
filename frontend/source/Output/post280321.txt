MAMP not detecting git cloned folders <body> Inside codehtdocs/code if I create a folder, I can see it using codemkdir test/code. However, if I use codegit clone {address}/code MAMP does not detect it. The permissions are the same (I even tried codechmod 777/code the files) but it still does not show up.  Unlike it not existing (NOT FOUND), it shows up as FORBIDDEN.  <answer280324> Okay this seemed to be because I had a link called codeindex.html/code inside, which was linking to a non-existent file.  This folder contained a codecreate-react-app/code.
