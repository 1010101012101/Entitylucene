Disabling startup items that run despite being unchecked on the "login items" list <body> I have a number of (background) programs that startup automatically on login even though they have been disabled (unchecked) on the codeLogin Items/code pane of the codeUsers &amp; Groups/code System Preferences. Examples include DropBox, ChronoSync Backgrounder, and Boingo.  strongQ:/strong How can I disable/control these login items that don't respond to the systems preferences settings? Related sub-questions:  ul liWhy do the checkboxes in the login items list not work?/li liWhat are all of the places that non-system startup items can be found/controlled?/li /ul  Current system configuration: MacBook (13in Aluminum, Late 2008), Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3 (11D50), But this problem existed on Snow Leopard before upgrading to Lion.  <answer42578> The checkboxes are not for disabling the application launch, but if checked, the application gets hidden as if you were pressing kbdCMD/kbd+kbdH/kbd. To disable it, select it in the list and click on the Minus-button beneath that list. By that you remove them. You can't just disable them with OS X tools.  To see a summary of all LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons you can use a software like Lingon or you can have a look at code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code, code/Library/LaunchAgents/code, code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/code, and code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/code as well as code~/Library/LaunchDaemons/code, code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code, code~/Library/StartupItems/code, and code/Library/StartupItems/code.  <answer42579> All login items are can be found under strongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Users &amp; Groups &#x2192; User &#x2192; Login Items/strong which you have correctly noticed.  ul liIf you want to strongdisable/strong a startup item you have to strongremove/strong it./li liThe checkboxes are merely for stronghiding/strong./li liemNote:/em Some applications need their auto-login option to be disabled in their applications' preferences./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K28zk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer93747> To remove BT cloud from login items search: for file 'com.f-secure.sync.BTCloud.plist' from one of the startup directories and delete file.  <answer247148> use  ul licodelaunchctl list/code to check the configured start up items. /li licodelaunchctl print-cache/code to see current running config which help to locate started process. /li /ul  <comment48377> Don't forget that items to run on startup can also live in `~/Library/Startup Items` and `/Library/Startup Items`. <comment48378> Oh yes, silly me. There is a little label that says Hide above the column. I've now cleaned up my startup items. Thanks. <comment48379> @binarybob Thanks for the tip on other places to look. I did find a few other unwanted items in `/Library/Startup Items` <comment109968> What is BTCloud? <comment163768> And yet... com.getdropbox.dropbox.plist doesn't live in *any* of these directories.  Where is it??! <comment163769> Where are the plist files for these items? I want to edit, not remove, but the plist I am looking for is not in any of the standard directories. <comment282190> Worth noting - if you have items in LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons folders, these commands operate on those files:  Stop this service once (will come back next log-on )  `launchctl unload /path/to/LaunchAgents/file.plist`  Stop this service and disable it  `launchctl unload -w /path/to/LaunchAgents/file.plist`  Start this service once  `launchctl load /path/to/LaunchAgents/file.plist`  Start this service and enable it:  `launchctl load -w /path/to/LaunchAgents/file.plist` <comment304918> A bit more details might be helpful here: How do these commands help to solve the problem stated in the question (what does the OP need to look for in the output)? <comment304962> Welcome to Ask Different.  It's helpful when you provide an explanation on how/why you think your answer is correct.
