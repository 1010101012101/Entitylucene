iPhone Gmail app marks all mail as important <body> I'm using the official Gmail application on my iPhone to receive my Gmail. The reason I use this app is because I label a lot of mails (newsletters for example) so they end up in a folder.  However, all the new e-mail I get also get marked as strongImportant/strong and I do not like that.  How can I prevent the Gmail.app from doing this (silly and annoying) behavior?
