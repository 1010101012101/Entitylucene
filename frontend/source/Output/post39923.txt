Python Weirdness on Terminal Open <body> When I open Terminal I see the following:  precodeLast login: Wed Feb  8 18:30:05 on ttys029 Traceback (most recent call last): File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/logging/handlers.py", line 75, in emit     self.doRollover() File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/logging/handlers.py", line 132, in doRollover     os.rename(self.baseFilename, dfn) OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory Error in atexit._run_exitfuncs: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/atexit.py", line 24, in _run_exitfuncs     func(*targs, **kargs) File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/logging/__init__.py", line 1472, in shutdown     h.flush() File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/logging/__init__.py", line 740, in flush     self.stream.flush() ValueError: I/O operation on closed file Error in sys.exitfunc: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/atexit.py", line 24, in _run_exitfuncs     func(*targs, **kargs) File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/logging/__init__.py", line 1472, in shutdown     h.flush() File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/logging/__init__.py", line 740, in flush     self.stream.flush() ValueError: I/O operation on closed file /code/pre  Everything seems to work but this is ugly and maybe warns of future trouble.  I've installed Python 2.7 on this machine, then removed it to a virtualenv to restore 2.6 as the system default.    Any thoughts on how I can debug this?  strongEDIT:/strong  My code.profile/code has a call to codevirtualenvwrapper.sh/code -- which, as I look it, is located under code.../Versions/2.7/code of Python.  So maybe I should look for the problem there?  <answer139594> From comment:  Check your code.bashrc/code or code.profile/code for Python specific code -- if you find something there make sure it is pointing to the correct version, be it code.../Versions/Current/.../code, code.../Versions/2.7/.../code, or whatever.  <comment45153> Maybe I'm missing something here, but why is python loading anything when you start Terminal.app?  Do you have something specific in your .bashrc or .profile that executes some python code? <comment45165> Yeah, virtualenvwrapper.sh, see my edit. <comment45166> Yeah, that's it -- pointing .profile to /Versions/Current/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh makes the cruft go away.  Phrase as an answer and I'll choose it. <comment45185> Looks like you answered it yourself.  Its ok to accept your own answer. <comment164560> The issue is correct but the solution is not necessarily - your current python might not be the one you want if you have multiple pythons <comment164577> @Mark:  How's this?
