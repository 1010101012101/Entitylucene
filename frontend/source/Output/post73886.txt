Disable Command-M to minimize window <body> On my keyboard layout, the kbdM/kbd key is right next to the kbdW/kbd key:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kw3KG.png" alt="Dvorak keyboard with adjacent m and w keys circled"  This can be problematic at times because occasionally I will accidentally press kbdCommand/kbd-kbdM/kbd instead of kbdCommand/kbd-kbdW/kbd, causing the window to be minimized rather than closed.  Since there's no keyboard shortcut to un-minimize a window (well ok, no strongeasy/strong keyboard shortcut), this is even more annoying because then I have to switch to my trackpad to un-minimize the window and then try again to close it.  Is there a way to disable the kbdCommand/kbd-kbdM/kbd shortcut for minimizing a window?  <answer73887> You can "override" the default Command-M shortcut by mapping it to something else. To remap the key combination, launch System Preferences and choose Keyboard. Then the Keyboard Preferences Panel appears, click on the right tab named "Keyboard Shortcuts". You will notice many default keyboard shortcuts that you can override.  I've tried remapping Command-M using this method and it works.  <answer73957> You can disable it by editing code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code:  precodedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Minimize' '\0' /code/pre  To apply the changes you have to reopen applications. If the shortcut was assigned to nil, pressing kbdL/kbd would trigger it in Audacity.  <answer114772> Remapping Command-M to Zoom in "All Applications" seemed to be a good workaround as Zoom appears in all applications and doesn't have nearly as disruptive an effect as an unintentional Minimize.  I was going to try the terminal command above so I went to remove the command M for Zoom and lo and behold, Minimize was now listed with no key command. So I just left it that way, now command-M does nothing and minimize lives harmlessly in the Menu. No terminal command necessary.  <answer158773> You can remap any key and key combination with the wonderful and free software Karabiner. After installing, just add the following code to your code~/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml/code:  precode  &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Map Cmd-M to Cmd-Alt-M&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;appendix&gt;Changes the minimize shortcut&lt;/appendix&gt;     &lt;not&gt;EMACS&lt;/not&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.kill_m&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L|ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_NONE&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt;    &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Map Cmd-Q to Cmd-Alt-Q&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;appendix&gt;Changes the quit shortcut&lt;/appendix&gt;     &lt;not&gt;EMACS&lt;/not&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.kill_q&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L|ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, KeyCode::Q, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_NONE&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  Then klick "Reload XML" in the Karabiner preferences and set checkmarks for the new items.  This way the minimizing shortcut is not entirely disabled but still available with the additional option key: kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdM/kbd or by simply using the right command key: kbdCmd (right)/kbd+kbdM/kbd.  Note that the second part also changes the kbdCmd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd shortcut to kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdQ/kbd for your convenience. You can omit the second item, if you don’t need it.  <answer158787> There's a handy keyboard layout called "Dvorak - Qwerty⌘". It's basically Dvorak, but it flips the layout to QWERTY while the ⌘ key is held down. It was designed so that people who want to learn Dvorak don't have to retrain their hotkey muscle memory, but it could help you too.  <comment186658> Too late; I've completely forgotten QWERTY by this point ;) <comment261780> This didn't work for me on Yosemite. I could do it with [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/125628/86276). <comment279041> Works. FTR, to the original setting (if you want to revert it) is `NSUserKeyEquivalents {     Minimize = "@$m"; }`
