How do I turn off App Store notifications in Mountain Lion <body> The App Store on Mountain Lion pushes update notifications through Notification Center. Unfortunately, this also happens for users that are not system administrators (and so cannot run the App Store). How can I turn this off?  Notification Center has preferences, where applications can be vetted, but App Store does not appear in this list.  <answer71011> I recently discovered that you can dismiss individual notifications by clicking on the app store update notification, and swiping/dragging to the right. I do it about 20x a day because I don't have the time to restart my iMac every day for software updates.  <answer71304> The best solution I've found for this so far has been to kbd&#x2325;/kbd+'click' the notifications menu icon in the top right and disable notifications. This resets every day though.  <answer72206> It's located in:  emSystem Preferences &lt; Security and Privacy &lt; Firewall &lt; Firewall Options (you might have to activate this) &lt; kbd+/kbd &lt; AppStore/em  Click the arrow on the right for a drop down to select "block all incoming connections" and I keep it like this until I decide it's time to update everything.  <answer80852> You can now simply go to System Preferences  App Store, and turn off "Automatically check for updates."  No messing with firewalls, and just works with App Store. So just remember to check every now and then manually to find out when you have updates!  <answer81157> Update: This doesn't work, the key appears to be ignored for some reason.  I think you might be able to change the default behavior of App Store.app by changing the codeNSUserNotificationAlertStyle/code plist entry from codealert/code to codebanner/code.  I just applied this change myself, but haven't been able to verify that it works because there haven't been any updates yet.  Here's what I did:  precodesudo nano /Applications/App\ Store.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  Find alert: code^w alert&lt;/code  replace with codebanner/code and save code^x y/code  <answer83126> I just discovered the missing solution here: http://osxdaily.com/2012/11/15/stop-software-update-mac-os-x/  You can strongselectively disable notifications about specific software updates/strong you don't care about (like useless App updates) by control-clicking the update inside the App Store to reveal a hidden "Hide Update" option.  This is best for those who want to keep Notification Center active for all its other uses (calendar alarms, etc.) and who also want to be notified about critical software updates. It should permanently mute notifications about certain software updates (until that software comes out with a new update).  (Hopefully this also works for the case where non-admin users are getting update notifications they can't act on.)  Screen-capture from OSxdaily article:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PXrvT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer87211> I found that the preferences for the notification center are located in a sqlite database in code~/Library/Application Support/NotificationCenter//code The file is named with a GUID so I'm not sure if it's the same for every account, but it was the only file in the directory and has a code.db/code extension. I used the following sql command  precodeupdate app_info set flags = 134 where bundleid = 'com.apple.appstore' /code/pre  I'm not 100% sure if it is working or not, but you can try it by running  precodesqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/NotificationCenter/*.db "update app_info set flags = 134 where bundleid = 'com.apple.appstore'" /code/pre  in a terminal.  h2Meaning of Flags/h2  As suggested, here's what I was able to figure out about the flags value by modifying entries through System Preferences and observing the resulting change in flag value.  The flag value appears to be a bitmask of at least 16 bits as follows  precode|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | M |   | A | b | S | B | H | /code/pre  The meanings of the fields are  strongM/strong Set if the options have been modified from the default valuesbr strongA/strong Set if alerts should be shown for the applicationbr strongb/strong Set if banners should be shown for the applicationbr strongS/strong Set if "Play sound when receiving notifications" is checkedbr strongB/strong Set if "Badge app icon" is checkedbr strongH/strong Set if "Show in Notification Center" is unchecked    I was not able to find any meaning for the remaining fields. The value 134 is the original value that the appstore entry had (which was 150) but with the alert bit cleared. I thought one of the extra bits set on the appstore entry was the one that caused it to be hidden from the preference pane, but even after clearing them it did not show up.  <answer119477> If you wish to go one step further and disable Notification Center permanently, open the Terminal (located in Applications/Utilities), and type in the following command followed by the return key:  h2sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool false/h2  You’ll be required to type in your administrator password to continue with the request to disable Notification Center. You can re-enable notification center by replacing “false” in the above statement with “true.”  After doing that, type in the following command to quit the Notification Center:  killall NotificationCenter When you log out and back in to your Mac, the Notification Center icon in the menu bar will be missing.  h2OR/h2  You can simply hide the update in the Mac APP Store or wherever your notification is coming from.

Simple   <answer126990> Disabling App Store Notification  Open your Applications folder and navigate to the App Store application. Right click on the application and select ‘Show Package Contents’.  Select the contents folder. Within this folder you will see an application named ‘Info.plist’.  Copy this to the desktop or another folder.  Open this file in Text Edit.  There are various options within this file.  Scroll down to the option which states. NSUserNotificationAlertStyle  alert Change ‘alert’ to ‘none’.  Save the file and copy it back to the location in which you found it. You will have to authenticate with your admin password to make the change since you are altering a protected system file. You may need to restart the App Store application, or your Mac. Credit for this idea is found on imgur.  <answer137255> Uh....for some reason I can't respond to Buscar up there who is talking about the whole code&lt;key&gt;/codeNSUserNotificationAlertStylecode&lt;/key&gt;/code thing, in response to "App Store Is Annoying".   If you go to info.plist in the package contents, and it looks all XML-y, I think the trick to this is to find that line with NSUserNotificationAlertStyle inside the code&lt;key&gt;/code tag, and then look below for the code&lt;string&gt;/code tag, which should be sandwiching the word "alert". Just change "alert" to "none"... I think that'll work. Will restart &amp; test out now.  <answer144520> Open System Preferences  Software Updates, then uncheck the box that says em"You will be notified when updates are ready to be installed"/em.  <answer235119> Go to settingnotificationapp storedisable allow notification  <comment70196> Isn't there an option in the `System Preferences - Notifications` to disable App Store ? <comment70197> App Store does not appear in the list of applications there. <comment70198> Bugger. Sorry for that. At work so couldn't look it up. <comment81339> Extra ugliness: You cannot dismiss the notification at all without bringing up App Store (which non-admin users cannot even use), and it also does not appear to fade away after some time either. <comment83301> Also, on a Magic Mouse (and presumably a trackpad), you can swipe on the top without clicking to right for this same behavior. <comment83951> +1. This is what I do now. And yes, I do it about 20x a day because it keeps coming back all the time. <comment84033> This will block automatic updates entirely, not just hide the notification. Administrators should definitely not use this option, although it might be OK for OP. <comment85484> It's extreme, but it stops a bunch of problems (Apple sometimes spams your internet connection - I've had periods where Apple re-checks this state every *30 seconds*, causing problems when you're trying to use your machine for anything CPU+b/w intensive (e.g. distributed builds). <comment88528> Where the heck did you get that from? (not saying the answers wrong, just Apple just have not implemented anything to do with the Mac App Store well at all) <comment93493> This does not work on 10.8, can anyone confirm if this works on 10.8.1 or 10.8.2? <comment93598> You should be able to delete your own answers if they are invalid. <comment95825> It's fine to copy / screen-capture directly from a source, in fact preferable to using a link, because in the long run, a great many links get deleted, or changed. <comment95830> Can users who are not an administrator (and cannot run the App Store) get to the App Store to click the "Hide Update" button? <comment101892> Do you have any documentation about this database, especially about the meaning of different values for the flags attribute? I would be rather reluctant to run this without a reference. <comment101908> @patrix Unfortunately there's no documentation, I just observed how the flags changed when I modified the alert style for other items and applied those changes to the entry for the appstore. I'll add some info on what I deduced to the answer. <comment107482> This disables _all_ notifications, not just the Mac App Store ones. <comment121810> This works for individual system updates (under the "Software Update" group), but the menu doesn't appear at all for other apps in the list. :( <comment132298> The flags for the App Store are reset all the time (modifying them while not logged into the GUI didn't help), so this doesn't work <comment133482> @Tobias pity! Seemed like a cool hack otherwise. I wonder which app resets the flags, and if it's hardcoded...  What would happen if you delete com.apple.appstore altogether? <comment138834> +1 Thank you so much! it drove me crazy... <comment139360> What mac do you have that requires daily restart for updates? 99.999999% of my updates don't require restart lol <comment139361> The swipe gesture is like a 5 minute snooze i believe <comment140471> Although the question could be more specific about the need. Your answer is incorrect. There is no "Turn Automatic Updates off". <comment148750> On 10.9.2 it shows keyNSUserNotificationAlertStyle/key <comment152887> You may find you can drag the notification to the right to *temporarily* dismiss it without bringing up App Store, but it pops back up ~ half an hour later ... <comment190261> or change 'alert' to 'banner' if you still want the notification to pop up, but you want it to be dismissable without opening the App Store like normal notifications. <comment200580> @jmk id right. doesn't work with apps. :(
