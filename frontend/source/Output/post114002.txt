Snow Leopard Server in Parallels with Retina MacBook Pro (No DVD Drive) <body> I'm trying to install Snow Leopard Server in a Virtual Machine in my Retina MacBook Pro, but I was unable to do it since I don't have a DVD drive in my MacBook.  I've done an DMG file from the original Snow Leopard Server DVD but, it has no effect, since Parallels cannot install Snow Leopard Server from a .dmg file.  Any ideas?  PS: I just want to use Rosetta.  <answer114310> strongUPDATE:/strong I totally read emeverything/em wrong. My mistake.  You should be able to install Snow Leopard Server by converting your DMG to ISO. See this OS X Daily article for full details:  Convert DMG to CDR or ISO with Disk Utility  If you'd rather create the ISO directly from the original disk, that's possible too.  <comment134008> It's Snow Leopard Server, and it's supported. <comment134044> @ViníciusFerrão You're absolutely right! What a blunder on my part. I've updated my answer. Thanks for the heads up.
