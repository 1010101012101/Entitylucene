Spotlight not showing top hit and other result categories on the side bar of the window- how to fix? <body> My macOS spotlight search has become unreliable as it's not showing me anything on the side-panel/side-bar which normally shows the top hits, the Bing results and other categories under which more results are shown for the particular query entered.   The only thing it gives me is the exact file, app or document for the query I enter. Below is a sample query image I extracted from Google which depicts how spotlight used to give me results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KoFbJ.jpg" alt="how Spotlight used to give me results"  If I enter the same query, this is how my Spotlight search shows the results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nY0T8.png" alt="What my Spotlight result show"  Now notice the lack of any sub results on the left side panel. Any clue why this might be happening and any way to fix this issue?  I'm currently running macOS Sierra strongversion/strong: em10.12.5 (16F73)/em.  <comment362610> oh i was going to suggest rebuilding the spotlight database. it is needed from time to time, but no. as far as i know there is no way to use or see the old spotlight, you can configure which categories show and a few more things, like not indexing pr0n folder, from system preferences... it is one of the reasons i didnt upgrade to sierra <comment363330> @Rostol Thank you for the suggestion. I've already tried rebuilding the database without any success and I've been using macOS Sierra for quite some time prior to this issue. Maybe it's due to the latest update as I upgrade regularly.
