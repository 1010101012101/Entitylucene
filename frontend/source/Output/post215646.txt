I apparently have a defective hard drive <body> I noticed my Mac ticking like a clock and turned it off - it obviously hadn't switched off properly.   When I reboot I get a flashing question mark, so I tried booting with ctrl+R.  Computer does not find Startup Disk.   In Mac OS X Utilities - Disk Utility when I select my HDD no emFirst aid/em is available but if I select restore and my HDD as the source with Mac OS X Base System as my destination - will I lose files by erasing the Base System / what will happen?  <comment260503> Do you have a backup? <comment260505> No I do not. I only have backups to single files/folders on various external HDs/sticks but not a comprehensive backup of my entire computer. <comment260508> The first thing to do is get that hard disk out & stop trying to boot from it, if you ever hope to get any recoverable data from it. <comment260510> Ok. Thank you I will find someone who can do that. <comment260535> Mac OS X Base System is the mini-OS for Recovery HD. Don't erase it.
