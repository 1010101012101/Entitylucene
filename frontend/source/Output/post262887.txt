iPad 4 frequently connects/disconnects from MacBook Pro <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) and an iPad 4. The iPad is freshly installed.  h3Problem/h3  Whenever I plug it into the left or right USB port of my MacBook, it connects for a fraction of a second (the power indicator on the iPad turns green and iTunes opens), but then it disconnects again. This goes on and on, re-connecting every few seconds.  There's a video of the behavior here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kgo4t.png" alt=""  h3What I've tried/h3  ul liWhen I plug it into the Apple keyboard's ports, it is not charging, but now the connection is stable. iTunes also recognizes it properly now./li liI've already tried it on another Windows PC, where it works fine. Also, I've tried using another cable â€“ no dice./li liRestarting the Mac and the iPad/li /ul  h3Other info/h3  Here's what the System Profiler has to say about the MacBook with no peripherals connected:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F2kuB.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GOD3a.png" alt=""  Is it the internal memory card reader that drains all the required power? But why?  What could I do to make this behavior stop?  <answer296037> After a broad search, I found this solution which worked for me:  On the iPad tap Settings  General  Reset  Reset Location &amp; Privacy. This will reset your location and privacy settings and require you to set up a trust relationship with the PC/laptop again.   But if you are running out of options ... try that and see if it works. I realize this thread is older, but posting this solution here in case it helps other people.
