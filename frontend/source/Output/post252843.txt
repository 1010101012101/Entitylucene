iOS 10 speed dial - too fast for systems to recognize! <body> iOS 10 had one surprise feature: The speed dial for adding a conference code to a call now dials much more rapidly.  In general, I appreciate this, but it has resulted in the code frequently being misparsed by the phone service, which means I have to dial the conference code manually; I usually don't have it at my fingertips, which results in a net slowdown for dialing in to (unfortunately frequent) phone calls!  Our firm uses Global ReadyConnect.  Has anyone else experienced this or found a solution?  I'd love to have it work just a bit slower, or worst case back to the pre-iOS10 speed.  <answer253429> I noticed this also and appreciate speed but I haven't had a problem with it being too fast. Have you tried adding commas in between each digit in the conference code? That may work for your particular use case.  For example  precode1(555)123-4567,,,1,2,3,4,5,6,# /code/pre  <comment314606> Could you explain speed dial? Are you automating 888111222,,,23456 or is speed dial something else entirely? <comment314941> I'm seeing the same issue <comment325357> I tried this and it makes the dialing painfully too slow. I've also had issues since iOS 10 with the remote system incorrectly parsing the new, faster speed dial.
