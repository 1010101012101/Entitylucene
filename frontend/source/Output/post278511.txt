iTunes opens itself after phone call (with iPhone connected) <body> I've disabled iTunes from auto-opening when connecting my iPhone. This actually seems to function fine, as when I plug in my iPhone, iTunes obediently doesn't open.  The problem is that, if my iPhone is plugged into my rMBP and charging, ending a phone call seems to trigger a new plug-in event, and then the "don't open" setting is ignored.   ul liI am running macOS Sierra 10.12.4 on a 15" rMBP with Touch Bar. /li liMy iPhone is running iOS 10.3 Beta (14E5269a). /li liI have the iPhone plugged in through a USB port. /li liI also have an iPad Pro plugged in directly to one of my USB-C ports./li /ul
