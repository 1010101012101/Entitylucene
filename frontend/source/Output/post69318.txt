Missing glibtoolize <body> One package I want to install (lua-posix) needs glibtoolize, where do I get that? I installed XCode and that Development Console Tools stuff, brew doctor is happy, and according to the them, glibtoolize should somewhere come from Apple.

Don't know how I could miss this simple solution!
