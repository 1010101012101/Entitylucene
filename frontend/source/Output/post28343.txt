Syncing Address Book with Android <body> Is there a way to sync Address Book with Android phones without using Google Sync (i.e., directly)?  <comment32571> Isn't it more of an [android.se] question? <comment32769> Alright, but I thought that other Apple users would have similar problems or solutions for this as well. <comment32778> To be clear, it's an actual question. I didn't vote to close. Let's wait and see if the community respond, otherwise, ask someone to migrate it to [android.se] :) <comment72264> If you use iCloud, then you might have some luck with this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.carddav.icloud
