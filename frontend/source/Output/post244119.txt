Boot MacMini (2014) from USB <body> Here is the problem.  A long time ago, I set my Mac Mini to dual boot (using Bootcamp, but with some third-party repartitioning).   I proceeded to install rEFInd, and eventually, to triple-boot. To find the right combination of partitions was a bit tedious, but I got it to work (using a GPT with a protective MBR disk layout, and a number of partitions, for recovery, for each system - three for Windows, two for OSX, one for Ubuntu Linux).  All was well initially, I could boot to rEFInd, and then move around and boot around as well.  strongBUT./strong One fine day, shortly after, my computer stopped detecting the internal HDD at boot time.  I'd get the blinking grey folder. I got out of it by booting from a Linux Live CD, every time, then restarting my way to the rEFInd partition.  That's right: after the Linux Kernel initial load, the whole computer sees the internal HDD once again.  strongI have tried:/strong  ol liSetting the boot HD in MacOSX, from "System Preferences"./li liRepairing file systems using Disk Utility, and also, using Onyx./li liResetting the NVRam and whichever equivalent of the PRam, using the reserved key combinations at startup + actions involving removing the power cable./li liCompletely reinstalling, repartitioning./li liReinstalling OSX over the network, not using any boot media./li /ol  strongTo no avail./strong  I am now running two systems, Ubuntu and OSX El Capitan, but to this day - and hear me out, the whole hardware is running fine, has been running for over a year just fine - yet, to this day, whenever I shut my Mac down, I have to resort to the Live USB procedure to gain access to rEFInd.  I am looking for:  ul liA way to boot into the supposedly programmable firmware? Tests I can run there?/li liA cure?/li liA way to boot from a nice, special type of USB image (UEFI or otherwise) that pipes me back into my HDD without the whole Live CD shenanigans./li /ul  In advance thank you.  <answer244127> Try disabling System Integrity Projection.  From what I've seen rEFInd doesn't play as well with El Capitan as it has with older versions.

I tried though, booted from an install media, disabled SIP, made sure no firmware password was set. No dice.
