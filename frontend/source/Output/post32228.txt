What's the correctly way to make Postfix run permanently on Lion (not server) <body> I can start Postfix temporarily with:   precode$ sudo launchctl launchd% start org.postfix.master /code/pre  However, Console.app shows that it only runs for a short time:  precode26/11/11 2:00:55.710 PM postfix/master: master exit time has arrived /code/pre  I think the file  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist needs to be updated to make Postfix run permanently, but I haven't found the answer yet.   What's the correct way of getting Postfix starting at boot time and running permanently?  strongUpdate/strong In order to edit the file as recommended by the selected answer, I first converted it to XML.    precodeplutil  -convert xml1 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist /code/pre  Then just edited it with Vim:   precodesudo vim /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist /code/pre  I had issues trying to get Xcode to edit the file.   <answer32569> The following changes worked for me:  ol liRemove the following two elements from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist:   precode&lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string&gt;60&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre   This will stop it exiting after 60 seconds./li liAdd the following element as a child of the code&lt;dict&gt;...&lt;/dict&gt;/code element in the same plist file:   precode&lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre /li liReload the file:   precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist  sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist /code/pre /li /ol  postfix should now be running as a daemon.  The above works on Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan too. For systems that have System Integrity Protection (El Capitan and later) there are two options:  ol liCopying code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist/code to code/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.custom.plist/code, changing codeorg.postfix.master/code to codeorg.postfix.custom/code and then unloading and loading as above./li liDisabling SIP (using codecsrutil/code), making the edits and then re-enabling SIP./li /ol  <comment148799> Worked for me on Mavericks, but I had to put the full file path in to load it: sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist <comment229369> There was a `cd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons` line in there before the `unload` and `load` that may have been missed. I inlined the full path to make it clearer. <comment328434> On El Capitan, `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist` is no longer editable. Suggestions? <comment328981> @ChrisWithers I've added some info. Basically, disable SIP, make the edits and re-enable. You'll need to boot from rescue media before you can enable/disable SIP though. <comment329025> i had to type "sudo postfix start" to mke it words instead of launchtl load stuff from mjturner; don't know why ... <comment329088> @mjturner - disable the sip? nope nope nope... Much better is just to create a new .plist that you own in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ <comment329211> @ChrisWithers Fair comment (unfortunately your suggested edit was rejected, not by me). I prefer the disable/edit/enable approach so that it's more obvious but yours is also valid. <comment329288> @mjturner - yeah, that's weird. I didn't get any notification, and it's a bit sad. Care to make the same edit? <comment329311> @ChrisWithers Yep, will edit my answer this evening and include your suggestion.
