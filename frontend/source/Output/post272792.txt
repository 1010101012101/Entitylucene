How to pause music on Windows laptop if call received on iPhone? <body> I have iPhone SE with latest ios version and a dell windows laptop with windows 10.  I usually listen to music mostly on my laptop, via my speakers or my bluetooth headphones. Since I don't have a Mac laptop, it's difficult to be able to hear the a phone call from my cell phone if I'm listening to music on my laptop.   Therefore, I'm looking for a way/an app/a device that can allow me to pause the music on my laptop if I receive a phone call on my iphone.  I tried some apps including codemobile mouse/code and codemonkey mote/code. I tried looking for bluetooth headphones and bluetooth receivers/transmitters with multipoint, and in both cases it's applicable to only the speakers or the headphones. So I'm still looking for a way to be able to pause the music upon receiving a phone call. I have codebluesleil/code stack for my windows 10, and it only allows playing music from the iphone... no call support on it.   So, I'm looking for an app, a bluetooth stack, bluetooth device or any way to be able to pause music upon receiving a phone call.  Thanks. -Mk.  <comment342988> could be duplicate, but it's bad answered. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/161355/pc-as-bluetooth-headset-for-iphone This also seems to be a Windows issue. I did a little search and there a lot of people complaining about the connectivity of Windows 10 with their phones via bluetooth. Some of them where able to solve their issues by installing a new bluetooth driver: https://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth Also have a look here for other complainers: https://goo.gl/xslfLv
