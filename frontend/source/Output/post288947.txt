Did you try to install Sierra **on top** of the beta of High Sierra?  It's a bit difficult to tell from your question. <comment364952> I tried to reinstall High Sierra using the recovery tool. <comment365073> I have the same issue. No startup chime is present. Startup options like recovery and select startup disk take longer to start into. So far I haven't been able to resolve it, but am looking for solutions.
