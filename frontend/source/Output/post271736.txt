Outlook 2016 (Mac) - Mark Email As Read Upon Delete <body> Assume, I cannot modify my workflow (because I won't and shouldn't have to.)  How do I get Outlook 2016 (for Mac) to function correctly by marking an email as read when I delete it (AND ONLY when I delete it...as it should be)? Microsoft apparently left out VBA in Office 2016 for Mac (typical) which is how I originally solved this issue on Windows.  AFAIK, AppleScript does not do what I need since I cannot bind a script or whatever to the "Delete" key in Outlook.  <comment341590> "as it should be" is a bit strong. I don't know of anyone else who would want that workflow. Most people like their email to be marked as read... when they read it. I would also assume most people don't delete their mail once read, in case they ever need to read it again. I think if you re-phrased the question to "how do I achieve this custom workflow" rather than "it's broken, sucks, fix it" then you'd get more takers.
