Problems using FireWire with iMovie upload from Sony camera <body> I'm using Adobe Premiere and iMovie together with a Sony camera on my MacBook Pro with FireWire connection, and the camera control is OK, but the picture is Blocking and capture is stopping every 5 to 10 sec.  Upload via FireWire from the same camera to a PC is working fine so I think the problem is related to the FireWire port or the QuickTime layer in the MacBook.  How can I rectify this problem as I would like to use my MacBook for my editing?
