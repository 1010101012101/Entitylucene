Why is 32% of my Mac's storage full with "system" files? <body> What does this mean:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RhoNt.png" alt="69.93 GB available of 249.78 GB"  The "system" section is taking up 80 GB. Why is it taking up so much and is there any way I can reduce it?  <comment342772> Files with unknown extensions fill up the System section, so that would explain that. <comment342801> @owlswipe that's a good answer. I didn't know that, maybe the fact that most of my device is filled up with program source files is what the large System section represents? <comment342810> Yep, that's what's happened to my MB too.
