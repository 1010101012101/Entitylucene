Connect Bluetooth Controller Macbook <body> Is there any software that can make my macbook (running el capitan) recognise my generic bluetooth controller?  Its an Amkette controller that gets detected on android and windows as a generic Bluetooth controller (HID?).  I cannot get it pair on bluetooth and there is no option to connect it via usb (it just charges the controller). There seem to be a lot of software for dual shock or Xbox controller but I couldn't find anything for a generic bluetooth controller.  Is there any software that you know of (preferably free) that can help me?  Best Regards,  Siamore
