Strange slow down and frozen like behaviour of Google Chrome Version 40.0.2214.115 (64-bit) on Yosemite <body> Do you also start facing such strange Chrome behaviour?  I am facing it mostly when browsing websites like YT with flash content. The browser freezes and I can not do basic things like e.g coping the selected text...  STRANGE: Chrome Version 40.0.2214.115 (64-bit) OS X: 10.10.2  DISCLAIMER: I got my Macbook PRO retina 3 days ago from service, where they replaced graphic system (whole logic board).   strongEXPERIMENT:/strong  create new OS X user and login into it, run Chrome and have a look if it works faster. For me it worked nice. Now I am trying to track reasons why it slow down so much on my current account.  <answer178030> Here are some things you can do to try to restore performance within Chrome within your own account. You could try each one at a time and see if it makes a difference.  h2Extensions/h2  Open the extensions tab from the Chrome's Window menu. Try disabling all the extensions and running Chrome again to see if performance has improved.   h2Saved Application State/h2  Close Chrome. Look for Chrome's saved application state folder within your account. You should find it at code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Saved Application State/com.google.Chrome.savedState/code. You can delete or rename the folder, it just keeps a record of which windows were open when you closed the application and what state they were in i.e. which sites you had open.  h2Cache folder/h2  Delete the code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome/code folder and try Chrome again. Chrome will automatically recreate this folder.  h2Application Support folder/h2  This folder contains a lot of things like cookies, history, extensions, some cached files, etc. So I'd try renaming the code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/code folder and trying again. Chrome will automatically create a new folder. If it makes no difference to performance, delete the new one and rename the old one back.  h2Preference list file/h2  Within code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences/code you should find the Chrome preference file.     com.google.chrome.plist   Just rename the file and try Chrome again. Chrome will create a new one. As with before, try with the new file, but if it makes no difference just delete the new one and rename the old one back.  h2Still not performing well?/h2  You could try running codesudo opensnoop | grep Chrome/code in a Terminal window and checking it when performance degrades. Perhaps it is trying and struggling to do something.  You could also try checking the Console.app for Chrome related error messages. Just open Console.app and type Chrome into the search field in the top-right corner of the window.  Good luck!  <comment211861> quite brute force, but worked ;)
