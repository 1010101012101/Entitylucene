Where is the New Oxford American Dictionary stored? <body> I'm trying to build a command line tool to look up definitions of words, it's only a dummy app for me to practise my C++ skills.  I know there is a list of words stored at code/usr/share/dict/code - but what I'm really looking for is the path to the New Oxford American Dictionary data, it comes bundled with the system, but I couldn't find it yet.  <answer82373> The dictionaries are stored in...  precode/Library/Dictionaries ~/Library/Dictionaries /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PYJOi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment95052> Apple provides API for C to access the dictionary services. Do keep in mind, that programming is off topic here - you might be better off seeing about looking for help on development topics at Stack Overflow. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/DictionaryServicesProgGuide/access/access.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006152-CH5-SW1 <comment95053> great thank you so much !
