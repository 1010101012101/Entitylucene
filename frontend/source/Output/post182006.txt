Yosemite printer panasonic DP C265 not print.

One solution is to disable sandboxing:     Edit /etc/cups/cups-files.conf and add this line: "Sandboxing Off",   restart cups: "sudo launchctl stop org.cups.cupsd"   However, another user has written a script which identifies those printer descriptions which need explicit path/to/file information, and automagically adds it. The path to the script is: http://tinyurl.com/oepe5go  I have used this script to allow me to print to my HP 5850 from Yosemite. My other printers (modern drivers) were not affected.  This solution is not mine. I found this answer through others' answers here  (https://discussions.apple.com/message/26887951#26887951). Good luck!  <comment216549> and this is your printer 192_168_15_20[1455] ? <comment216554> Means get an updated driver. <comment216585> The file read is being sandboxed - whatever is calling the file is possibly using a string ref not a POSIX file ref. The 1st line would appear to confirm that guess. <comment229580> Hi Parradoxx, welcome to Ask Different. Please add the script here if you can, and credit the author (as you appear to have done). Links tend to get broken. <comment340304> "Sandboxing Off" seems to not work, in El Capitan (Mac OS 10.11) anyway. According to this page: https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/MacOS1010YosemiteKnownIssues the correct syntax is "Sandboxing Relaxed" However, neither of these seems to enable my computer to print.
