Sharing mac clipboard with vim inside terminal <body> I use vim inside terminal and trying to share the mac clipboard with vim.  Compiled vim with xterm_clipboard support and installed XQuartz.  precodeMacBook-Air:web-ui nagakirank$ vim --version | grep xterm_clipboard +xsmp_interact +xterm_clipboard -xterm_save  Nagas-MacBook-Air:web-ui nagakirank$ echo $DISPLAY /tmp/launch-ltuLWk/org.macosforge.xquartz:0 /code/pre  But,am not able to get Mac clipboard content inside vim using "+" register "+y.  Now,clueless on why it's not working..Need pointers on how to debug this?  <answer72998> Try building Vim 7.3 with the codeclipboard/code feature enabled. Starting in Vim 7.3, code+clipboard/code uses the OS X pasteboard directly (via the code*/code or code+/code register, as you expected).  It probably is possible to use code+xterm_clipboard/code with an X server configured to convert X’s selection to and from the OS X pasteboard, but it would probably be more problematic than the direct code+clipboard/code solution.  hr  As an example, the MacPorts build of the codevim/code port that I have currently installed (codevim @7.3.661_0+huge+perl+python27+ruby+tcl/code) has code+clipboard/code, code-xterm_clipboard/code, and can access the pasteboard through code*/code and code+/code.  Also, if you happen to be running Vim inside emtmux/em you will probably need my wrapper program to reenable pasteboard access inside emtmux/em sessions; this only applies to code+clipboard/code access: X-mediated access might still work OK—as long as you keep DISPLAY updated—but still seems unnecessarily cumbersome to me.  <comment84780> It's working fine when vim launched outside screen and problem is only with vim inside screen. Went through your post and found that screen installed via Ports has the patches to fix this. Installed screen via Ports and that solved the issue..Thanks..Haven't expected I would be able to solve this easily
