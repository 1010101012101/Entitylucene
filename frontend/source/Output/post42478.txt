How can I redownload apps I deleted outside of iTunes? <body> When I stopped syncing my iPad to my PC I deleted the folder that had all my apps. Now I'm syncing again on a different hard drive, and I get the message      The app "X" could not be used because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it?   Of course I can't locate it, and there's no Download option that I see if I right click. These apps are missing their icons in iTunes as well, and I don't really know how this will affect syncing.  Is there some way I can redownload these apps back onto my machine? It's iTunes for Windows if that matters.  <answer42479> If iTunes in the Cloud is available in your country (it is in most), go to the iTunes Store,  click on "Purchased" in the right-hand navigation bar, select Apps at the top, and then click the download button next to any app you'd like to download.  <answer102894> You can also "strongTransfer Purchases/strong" from a device to your computer.  This is what I had to do when moving from an iPad 2 to iPad 4, to get the apps to transfer across properly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VGUlT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment48286> Thanks! There's also a Download All button at the bottom, which is exactly what I was hoping for. <comment48299> I'm pretty sure this works in all countries. Only music/movies/tv shows are restricted to specific countries. <comment238815> Doesn't work in the latest iTunes - "Not in my library" is empty and "All" is full of apps that don't exist on my system. Will post a solution if I find one.
