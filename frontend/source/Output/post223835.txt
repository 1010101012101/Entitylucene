Am I allowed to request donations in an iOS App? <body> I am currently developing an app for a client for which I plan to integrate a PayPal API to accept donations from users. The app is otherwise free.  Since the organization is not yet registered legally as a non-profit organization, I would like to know if this is allowed according to Apple standards.  <comment271399> All financial stuff needs to go through the App Store either as the initial app purchase, in-app purchase or subscription. Apple will take its 30% off the top. Marco Arment has successfully implemented a 'tip jar' in one of his apps (I don't remember which one) which allows users to make donations but these go through Apple who take their cut. There is no way to include direct Paypal payments as far as I know.
