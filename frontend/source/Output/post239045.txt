Lion to El Capitan upgrade stuck on restart <body> I'm upgraded an late-2011 MacBook Pro from Lion to El Capitan. The install itself seemed to go fine. It got to the step where it restarts after the install and now it just hangs on this screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LnBOd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried restarted a few times and it keeps coming back to this. Tried booting in safe mode as well, with no luck.  I get the startup chime, then this. It's sat on this for a few hours at this point with no additional progress.  Machine specs:  ul li2.4 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 Processor /li li4GB 1333MHz DDR3 SDRAM/li li500 GB Hard Drive, 8x DVD/CD SuperDrive/li /ul  <comment293266> Have you tried holding down `Option` when booting? <comment293269> Following on from @Brick I would try restarting holding down the `Alt/Option ` key and see if you get a choice of drives. <comment293270> Another good question is did you backup your data first ? It's usually a good idea to back up your data and do a clean install of any operating system when upgrading rather than just an in-situ upgrade itself. <comment293273> What about holding down `Command`+`R` for OS X Recovery or `Option`+`Command`+`R` for Internet Recovery? And then what about resetting PRAM with `Option`+`Command`+`P`+`R`?
