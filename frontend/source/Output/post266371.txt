How Does iTunes Sync Loved Metadata? <body> A tcpdum of "loving" a song on iTunes yields an empty ppcap file. Is the data cached and synced later? If so, when and where?  <answer266378> Check out this thread  I believe it is a server side stored field. I do not believe it is suppose to sync (even though it would be nice)  If you want to keep track of the music you "love" I would recommend just adding to a playlist.
