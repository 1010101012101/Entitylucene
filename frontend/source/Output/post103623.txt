iterm2 and tmux: Keyboard conflicts <body> When I open a terminal in iTerm2, I can use the command key to make it work like Meta, so that I can for example move between words (e.g. with kbd⌘/kbd-kbdf/kbd and kbd⌘/kbd-kbdv/kbd.   However, as soon as I start a tmux session within the terminal (e.g. by typing codetmux new/code, for some reason these bindings don't work anymore, why? and how can I fix it?  h2Update/h2  Below is a picture of my iTerm2 preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KqUi1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer103628> Do you have the command keys mapped to option in the Keys tab and the option keys set to act as meta in the Profiles tab? If you do, set the option keys to act as "+Esc" in the preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJI5b.png" alt=""  When the option keys are set to act as meta, they are not recognized in codetmux/code.  Edit: code\e[1;5D/code and code\e[1;5C/code are not recognized by codetmux/code either. You could just map ⌘B  to code\eb/code and ⌘F to code\ef/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/StvfX.png" alt=""  <comment121957> Thanks I have that activated already, but I am actually using `Command-f` and `Command-b` to move between words (see my updated edits), so that should not be related. <comment122127> Have you enabled the `xterm-keys` window option? Without it *tmux* will recognize `^[[1;5D` as M-Left, but if `xterm-keys` is off it will transmit it as plain Left (i.e. `^[[D` or `^[OD`).
