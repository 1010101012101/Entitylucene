Opening an attached pdf file on wiki page outside of browser <body> I have set up a personal wiki on a localhost using drupal. I have attached pdf's that open in the browser window which is generally ok but I'd rather be able to open them in Preview so I get all the usability benefits of that app (without downloading them and thus creating a 2nd version outside the wiki directory). Anyone have a suggestion?  <answer8699> I don't think you can open them in Preview without downloading them.  Also - by merely opening or viewing the document at all, you are actually downloading it.  It's stored in a temp directory somewhere, and likely trashed when you close your browser.  <comment9271> Since youÂ´re working on a localhost: are the links to the PDFs http:// or file:// ? In the latter case I guess you should be able to get it to work.. <comment9279> Asmus links are http:// but I'll research that and see if I can't tweak something, thanks. <comment9280> Interesting Harv, thanks !!!
