Imac osx 10.7.5 , Iphone 5, Ipad <body> I like to synchronise all my devices especially the iCal information, however each time I do this all of my music on my iMac transfers to my phone which has not got enough memory. I don't mind not having music on my phone, somewhere I read something about setting Synch to manual but I dont know how to do this.  <answer251569> (I'm assuming you're using iTunes for the sync).  To manually choose what music you want to sync, connect your iPhone to your iMac and open iTunes if it doesn't automatically open.  Then go into the iPhone section by clicking on the iPhone icon next to the drop-down menu.  On the sidebar below the iPhone, click on 'Music'.  You can then unstick the 'Sync Music' option at the top, or select 'Selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres', from which you can select the desired music.  <comment312775> Can you please add some details about your setup: What exactly do you want to syncronize (calendar, contacts, other stuff)? Where do you keep the data you want to sync (locally, on iCloud, on Gmail, somewhere else)? Which version of iTunes are you running?
