Converting AVCHD files to mp4 <body> I have recently recorded some college lectures using my Canon handycam.  The files I seem to have are in AVCHD format.  I'd like to know if there is a relatively fast method to convert them into .mp4 format.  I bought iMovie but with dismay I have been totally defeated by its interface.   I was thinking of using ffmpeg but thought I'd ask the question here first.  Thanks.  <answer123722> Try out Handbrake, it's the best and free converter I've used on my Mac. The interface is easy and pretty straight forward.  <answer123728> Handbrake should be able to handle AVCHD files. It relies on some codec library files from VLC player, so it may help to have that installed as well. Handbrake uses ffmpeg underneath the hood.  Alternatively, AVIdemux may also be useful. It's a bit more of an editor than just an encoder, but if it can read the source files, it should be able to output the desired encoding.  Commercially, SmartConverterPro has worked okay for me.  <answer134913> strongWhy Sometimes Can't Import MP4 to iMovie?/strong  A guide on how to import MP4 to iMovie told us:  strongemReason One/strong: iMovie only supports importing MP4 formats with MPEG4/AAC or H.264/AAC data, not all kinds of MP4 formats. Some MP4 files from like Sony, Hybrid camcorders and other devices cannot be accepted by iMovie./em  strongemReason Two/strong: iMovie contains all the essential codecs to read MP4 files. Any different codecs included in audio and subtitle will cause the issue. In the circumstances, we still cannot successfully import MP4 files to iMovie./em  <comment144497> Thanks for the response -- just downloaded it but it does not seem to be able to open the AVCHD file. <comment144500> Thanks, i keep it open as answer in case anyone is looking for a converter. <comment159192> Maybe you can add Adapter to the list as well : http://www.macroplant.com/adapter/ <comment159845> This doesn't address the question. <comment202754> I assume you're using iMovie '11 (aka v9.x), because the current version of iMovie (10.x) now supports AVCHD natively, with a much quicker import (lossless, essentially same file size).
