How to remove a little "connection" between clips in 2 tracks in iMovie? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pCPGi.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is the square I mean. I know what is it for. It means that two clips have strong connection in these particular places. But now I need to remove these relative connection:-) The question is strongHOW/strong?  <answer184503> You can't. Audio tracks are attached to a specific video clip.  You can move them though: hold ⌥⌘ and click somewhere on the audio clip.  <comment218769> It is not about audio tracks. It is about a little green **rectangle** within yellow boundaries. <comment218770> @Bartłomiej It's because of the audio track. It's a connection triangle from the audio track underneath. It indicates that the audio track is connected to that video clip at that point. <comment218771> I don't wish to be disrespectful here - but after 3 consecutive questions on the same theme; did you think about Googling some tutorials?
