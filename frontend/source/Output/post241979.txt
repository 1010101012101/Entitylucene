Any iPhone free app could convert *.wmv file to *.MP4? <body> I'm using mobile more often than notebook, so would like to have an app converting videos.   <answer242168> Try "The Video Converter," an iPad and iPhone app, that promises to convert files including .WMV files to formats like .MP4.  Download The Video Converter  <comment297460> did you mean .webm files? Have you tried the online sites such as Zamzar? <comment297461> @MrU sorry for the typo <comment297466> Might be better on softwarerecs.stackexchange.com, but it's valid here. <comment297652> Can you just use an online video converter? I don't think iPhones support .wmv <comment297659> @JohnRamos VLC etc support playing wmv files but not converting <comment297728> @athos Looked a little harder and found something, posted it as an answer! Tell my if it helps or not. <comment297758> Seems there's no free converter app <comment297759> @athos it seems that way to me. Glad this helped you though.
