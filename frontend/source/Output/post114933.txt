Is there a keyboard shortcut to bring up Finder? <body> Is there a default keyboard shortcut to start a new Finder window? If not, is there a way to assign one?  I tried System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts and created a new item for Finder, and assigned kbdshift/kbd-kbdcommand ⌘/kbd-kbdF/kbd, among other things, but nothing worked.  <answer114934> By default, no, there's no keyboard shortcut to activate Finder.  strongKeyboard Maestro/strong can do this though:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GIAAd.png" alt="When ⇧⌘F, activate Finder"  <answer114935> ol liOpen Automator and choose the service template./li liChange the input type from selected text to no input./li liAdd a Launch Application action and drop Finder on the pop-up button from /System/Library/CoreServices/. (The dialog for choosing an application does not allow selecting Finder.)/li liSave the service and give it a shortcut in System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services./li /ol  The service only opens a new window if there is no existing Finder window. To open a new window every time, add a Get Specified Finder Items action, drop the folder you want to open on the list, and then add a Reveal Finder Items action.  hr  Automator is included in OS X: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14303 (Mavericks), http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11360 (Mountain Lion), etc.  Background: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software)  Further reading if you're interested in doing more with Automator: http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/  <answer114969> Actually I find it easy to bring up the finder with COMMAND-TAB. Cycle thru the open applications till you have selected Finder.  If any windows are already open but hidden they pop to the front if none are open a simple COMMAND-N opens a new window.  Not exactly a simple WINDOWS-E but it does work.  <answer115166> If you have the Powerpack for Alfred 2, you can create a workflow like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NsEqi.png" alt=""  Hotkeys have a short delay by default, but you can reduce it by changing the trigger behavior:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Hs8D.png" alt=""  Another option is to use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url&gt;file:///System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;shortcuts&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;shortcuts&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F12, ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <answer115651> If you use TotalFinder there is a nice 'visor' feature which causes a Finder window to slide up from the bottom of the screen. The sliding in or out can be linked to a hot key combo (double press option works well for me) and then it is always easy to do a bit if quick Finder manipulation.    <answer163790> It's actually easy. On Yosemite, just press kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdspace bar/kbd. That will open a new Smart Finder window. You then can navigate from there. It works on a system level no matter what application you're running.   No need for scripts or complicated setups.   <answer178214> COMMAND + SPACE + F (if you know what i mean!)  <answer181390> You can always use this trick to open Finder..  precodealt + command + &lt;space&gt; /code/pre  This is actually a shortcut to search for files IN FINDER MODE, In other words it opens Finder directly without needing to install any tools.  You can add your favorite directory onto the sidebar (Finder  System Preferences  Sidebar) and access it easily.  <answer181403> kbdOption/kbd + kbdCommand/kbd + kbdSpace Bar/kbd works, and you don't even need to be "in" the Finder app.  Works from anywhere - it's the best way.  Technically, it brings up a Finder search window, but it is a Finder window.  <answer191714> You can use the default kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdspace/kbd to show Finder search window, or make one using app shortcuts with a really hard to find combination nobody uses since kbdF/kbd is popular character for shortcut.  <answer194788> I also had this question too and was hoping that one of these solutions that didn't require 3rd party software I would be happy with but unfortunately the OPTION + CMD + SPACE doesn't cut it for me because it opens a blank Finder window every time. And I couldn't figure out the instructions to get an Automator script to launch Finder.  I even tried using an Apple script action in Automator but they just didn't work the way I wanted.  However I did find a SUPER simple app on the Mac App store that behaves exactly the way I wanted so I thought I would share.  NOTE: you do need to create a manual shortcut for Finder as this app doesn't count Finder as the first app in your dock. But the thing I like most is a second press of the shortcut will hide the app too. Simple and beautiful.

Press strong'command + shift + ~'/strong ,then you will have a surprise.  <comment134592> This really good but the Keyboard Maestro answer allows you to specify many more options; for example, if you press the shortcut key again, it toggles back to the prior front application <comment134622> I guess if you don't have too many windows open, that would be fine. I just missed the old Windows-E so I now programmed F6 using Keyboard Maestro <comment134626> How can i run Automator? <comment135124> @Saeed: Press COMMAND + SPACE to get the Spotlight window and type 'Automator' then press Enter. Alternatively open 'Applications' from a Finder window and double-click the icon in there. <comment138229> Just bought total finder. It's pretty nice, thanks <comment207320> This is actually the most appropriate answer to the question! Thanks netrox :-) <comment262769> option + command + spacebar is all you need to open a Finder. <comment271280> I used your advice, but made some changes as your method made 2 windows pop up, and the folder did not open. I use 2 actions: Get Specified Finder Items-Open Finder Items. Thanks for the info! <comment285918> @netrox thanks! <comment297586> This should be the accepted answer. <comment337533> for me `option`+`command`+`space bar` brings up "Search This Mac". It used to bring up Finder, but now it doesn't do it anymore since last month. Does anyone know why? And how could I open Finder instead with this key combination? thanks <comment339329> It still opens Finder... it does say Searching this Mac with Sierra but it's still a Finder. What are you expecting to see in Finder?
