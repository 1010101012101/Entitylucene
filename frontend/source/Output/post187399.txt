What's the easiest way to do a screen recording and get a small file? <body> I've used http://screenr.com/ before but for company things it's not appropriate since it becomes public. I need something that lets me record my screen and gives me a small well encoded file that I put into dropbox.  What's my options?  <answer187403> h1Quicktime/h1  You can use QuickTime Player to record everything that happens on your computer’s screen or on a portion of your computer’s screen, along with your narration, if you’d like. This is called a screen recording.  ol liIn QuickTime Player, choose File  New Screen Recording./li liChoose options for the screen recording from the arrow pop-up menu.  ul liIf you want to record yourself speaking as you use the computer, choose an audio input source below Microphone in the pop-up menu./li liChoose whether you want the recording to be medium or high quality. High quality results in a larger file size./li liIf you want mouse clicks to be visible in the recording, choose “Show Mouse Clicks in Recording.”/li liIf you want to change where the recording is saved, choose Choose, and then select a new location./li /ul/li liArrange the computer windows as you want to capture them, and then click the Record button.  ul liIf you want to record only a portion of the screen, drag the pointer to select the portion of the screen you want to record, and then click Start Recording.br To adjust the portion of the screen you selected, drag the small gray circles along the edges of the screen recording rectangle or drag the entire screen recording rectangle to another location on the screen./li liIf you want to record the entire screen, click anywhere on the screen to start the recording./li /ul  4.To stop the recording, click the Stop button, or press kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd Esc /kbd./li /ol  emSource: Apple KB - QuickTime Player 10.x: Record your computer’s screen/em  From comments…br If the file sizes are still too large, there is Apple's own excellent Compressor ($49.99) or for a simpler approach, still with many possibilities, you could look at SmartConverter (freeware)  <answer187811> iShowU can do screen recordings. You can ajoust the framerate, resolution and whether it should track mouse movements or not for a smaller file size. It is $29.95.  If you need to convert, compress or crop an existing recording, try Handbrake (it's free).  <comment221494> That's what I would go with too. If you want very small video files, you should try compression softwares like [Compressor](https://itunes.apple.com/app/compressor/id424390742) to reduce your recording file size. In general, Quicktime will make video files that are small enough, but if you need additional control, Compressor is awesome for that. <comment221495> Good suggestion - I'll add that into the answer with another, freeware possibility.
