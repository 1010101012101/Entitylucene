Shift key + scrolling behaving different with vim <body> I often scroll above the current document in Vim. I usually do this by pressing the shift key and then using the mouse or the trackpad. Recently I noticed that with the mouse this feature stopped working. Basically pressing the shift key on my external keyboard and scrolling upwards with the trackpad gives me the expected result. But holding the same key on the external keyboard and scrolling upwards with the external mouse does nothing. Any clues?
