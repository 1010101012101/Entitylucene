With Yosemite pop-over doesn't work when holding keys down anymore <body> I always used the accented character pop-over menu often, by holding a key for a second or two.  Now, with Yosemite suddenly all I get is something like:     Resumeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee   When I want the chance to type:     Resum√©   I feel like I'm missing something obvious.  <answer156584> Resume  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KmC4.jpg" alt="accent"  Maybe it is disabled for some reason ?  precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false /code/pre  to enable copy paste following in your Terminal app located in the utility folder.  precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true /code/pre  <comment184055> Try adding another keyboard like French to your list in system prefs/keyboard/input sources and restart. <comment184188> Thank you.  Adding French and restarting did the trick.  It was driving me crazy. :)
