Automatically move files when inserting SD card? <body> Is there a way to detect the insertion of an SD card so it would be possible to automatically move specific files (photos in subdirectory) to another location? I do not want a photo application to take control. Even better, when I put the card in, I get asked whether to move the files. I would like the files to be moved directly to a shared folder..  <answer9077> From strongthis question/strong on SuperUser, try strongMarcoPolo/strong  Or, you could use strongfolder actions/strong.
