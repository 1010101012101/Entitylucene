Mounting cue/bin files <body> There are many suggestions on the internet on how to use cue/bin files on a Mac.  Is there a native way of mounting cue or bin files and seeing them as Volumes in Finder?  Alternatively, are there any tools&mdash;in the vain of Daemon Tools on a Windows machine&mdash;that provide this functionality?  emI would very much like avoid converting the files I have./em  <answer12815> Have you tried Control+Click (right click) on the .bin file and open with Disk Utility?  <answer12816> Stuffit Expander (Select strongStuffIt Expander Only/strong if you want to download it from that site, dont get any adware crap) can open bin files, and from what I remember cue files are just information maps about bin files.   I forget if you can view them as Volumes, but that seems like a secondary concern, converting them is a emlengthy/em process if you have more than a few files.  <answer84121> I've just used Unarchiver and its extracted all the files in the .bin and i've been able to get the .wmv files that way.  <answer112880> You can get Daemon tools free trial for OSX to mount bin file.  <answer179113> I use binchunker to convert .bin/.cue files to a single .iso file on my Mac. You can obtain binchunker via Homebrew or Macports.  Here's some more info from the manpage:  precodebchunk - CD image format conversion from bin/cue to iso/cdr  SYNOPSIS        bchunk [-v] [-p] [-r] [-w] [-s] &lt;image.bin&gt; &lt;image.cue&gt; &lt;basename&gt;  DESCRIPTION        bchunk converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format (sometimes ".raw / .cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks.         The  bin/cue  format is used by some non-Unix cd-writing software, but is not supported on most other cd-writing pro-        grams.         image.bin is the raw cd image file. image.cue is the track index file containing track types and  offsets.   basename        is used for the beginning part of the created track files.         The  produced .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be mounted through a loop device on Linux systems, or        written on a CD-R using cdrecord.  The .cdr tracks are in the native CD audio format. They can be either written on a        CD-R using cdrecord -audio, or converted to WAV (or any other sound format for that matter) using sox.         It  is  advisable  to  edit  the  .cue  file to either MODE2/2352/2048 or MODE2/2352/2324 depending on whether an ISO        filesystem or a VCD is desired, respectively.  The format itself does not contain this feature and  in  an  ambiguous        case it can only guess. /code/pre  <comment13439> I have, Disk Utility pops out but doesn't see it. <comment13440> Actually, I've just found out by trying that Unarchiver can do the same (i.e. extract). Hopefully someone will be able to find out how to *mount* them. <comment132506> Hi Welcome to AskDifferent, I find if a question is worth answering it is worth upvoting.  Also some instructions and a link may get you more upvotes. <comment250121> Does it work for the CUE files that are audio? <comment250143> Its been a few years(5), but if I remember correctly the CUE files referred to here dont actually have the data, just a reference to the data, so if that is all you have its probably not what you are looking for, but I would do some additional googling. <comment257400> `brew install bchunk` for those with homebrew
