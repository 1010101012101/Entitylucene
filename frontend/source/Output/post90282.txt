Is there a virtual filesystem plugin for iTunes Playlists? <body> There are a number of apps that for various reasons do not support the ability to drag songs out of iTunes and drop it onto the app. This becomes taxing whenever I'm working with a compilation of files that spans a number of folders; worse still when there are a few intentional duplicates and remixes with similar filenames that makes searching (via spotlight) difficult.  Are there any plugins that will create a virtual directory space that will allow me to "browse my playlists" via the Finder? And simply drag out files as if they were real into a new destination?  <comment105973> I suspect that if this exists, it would hopefully be built on-top of [MACFuse](https://code.google.com/p/macfuse/) or [OSXFuse](http://osxfuse.github.io/).
