SNTP timeout after 15 seconds but default is supposed to be 68 sec <body> Using sntp to query an NTP server times out after just 15 sec.   precodeStevens-MacBook-Air:~ Steve$ sntp -d time.nist.gov Starting to read KoD file /var/db/ntp-kod... sntp sendpkt: Sending packet to 2610:20:6f15:15::27...

Server unusable on_wire failed for server 216.229.0.179! /code/pre  According to sntp documentation and man page for sntp, default is supposed to be 68 seconds. Is this a bug sntp installed in OS 10.11.6?  <answer281058> Apple's manual page says the default is 5 seconds, but I'm seeing the same 15 second timeout as you in practice. I'd file a bug against the documentation to make it match (if you want) and then specify the timeout you want on macOS:  precodesntp --timeout 68 -d time.nist.gov /code/pre  <comment353647> Where did you see manual page that says default in 5 sec. From terminal "man sntp" returns:  ` -t seconds, --timeout=seconds               Specify  the  number  of  seconds  to wait for broadcasts.  This               option takes an integer number as  its  argument.   The  default               seconds for this option is:                    68' <comment353654> @Steve I just right click on the command in terminal and let the system open the man page for `sntp` in a new window.
