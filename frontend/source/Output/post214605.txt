Internal keyboard stops working when usb keyboard plugged in <body> My MacBook Pro internal keyboard frequently stops working after an external USB keyboard has been plugged into it.  I have to do a hard reboot to recover (which I unfortunately need to do every time I transition from work to home).  Anybody have any suggestions on how to get around this?  Currently OSX Yosemite 10.10.5 is installed.

Have you checked for updates via the App Store?  What model is your MacBook Pro?  (Go to ï£¿  About this Mac) I.e.: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)  Also, what brand is your USB keyboard?  Apple, Logitec, etc.?  Cheers and welcome to Ask Different! <comment259356> Model: MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013).  Apple Keyboard.  No firmware updates are waiting in the App Store.
