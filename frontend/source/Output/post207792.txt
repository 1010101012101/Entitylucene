System Sounds Not Playing on iPhone 6s, iOS 9.0.1 <body> For whatever reason my new iPhone 6s doesn't always play system sounds, such as  the Siri chime (there's also no Taptic feedback), the "magnetic click" when I lock my iPhone (which sometimes does work), and others. Even though some other sounds do play, such as the charging chime.  When I had my iPhone 5s running iOS 9, though the Siri sound didn't play, I got vibration feedback when I summoned Siri. My iPad Air (also running iOS 9) strongdoes/strong play all of the sounds.  So is this an iPhone 6s specific thing, where Apple's trying to limit sounds to make a more Apple Watch-like experience, a software bug, a Setting that I missed, or something else entirely?  <comment251043> This may be a bug and we'll just need to wait for 9.0.1+. I have the opposite of this problem. Sometimes I get sounds while all my sounds are disabled. <comment251044> @y3sh That's kind of what I'm thinking. Do you have an iPhone 6S? <comment251045> Added note: I have found several other bugs that I solved with toggling settings off/on and restarting the phone. <comment251046> Yes I have a 6S <comment251047> @y3sh Cool. I'll try that, thanks. <comment251048> The other settings-toggle bugs include: message character counts appearing, predictive text on, transparency off, high contrast off, and motion off. Yep, it's still early for a stable release
