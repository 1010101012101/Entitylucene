iTunes Store says my card is invalid <body> My iPad is telling me that my card is invalid and I've used it before. When I go to the payment method my security number is gone from the info. When I input the number it says my payment method isn't valid. I don't know what I need to do. My card works and I've used it before. Why can't I use it now?  <answer166917> Unfortunately this doesn't seem like a problem that we can solve.  If you're sure you're entering the card details correctly, and that the card is still active and you can use it elsewhere you need to call your card issuer and possibly get in touch with Apple.  <comment195661> Sounds like your card is being declined or in some other way is invalid. I would call your card issuer.
