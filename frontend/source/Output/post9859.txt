How can one create a shortcut for pasting unformatted text in Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac? <body> iWork provides the keyboard shortcut Cmd-Option-Shift-V to paste text without it's original formatting. How can I get this or a similar shortcut key for Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac?  <answer9868> There's a "PasteDestinatationFormatting" command.  Go to Tools  Customize Keyboard, then select "All Commands" in the left pane.  In Word 2011, the default keys are command-option-shift-v.  <answer9869> I found the answer in this blog post  Create the AppleScript:  precodetry   set theClip to Unicode text of (the clipboard as record)   tell application "Microsoft Word" to tell selection to type text text theClip end try /code/pre     Save in   /Users/YourUserName/Documents/Microsoft   User Data/Word Script Menu Items as   Paste unformatted\mosV.scpt (the   backslashed bit at the end of the   filename provides the shortcut).   Restart Word and you can now paste   without importing extraneous styles   with Apple-Alt-Shift-V.   <answer83499> Answer to the same problem but for Microsoft Word 2011: how to assign pasting as unformatted text to Cmd+V.  <answer122782> This blog post describes a method by redefining kbdCmd-V/kbd to a custom macro:  ul liUnbind kbdCmd-V/kbd from standard “Paste”./li liRecord a macro for kbdCmd-V/kbd./li liFix the source code of the new macro (by replacing wdPasteDefault with wdFormatPlainText)./li /ul  If you want to keep standard "Paste" functionality it might be better to use another key combination though.  <answer125025> If you assign a short cut key to "Paste Special..." it's just another quick DOWN and RETURN to paste without formatting.  <comment10331> Must be in a different version of word. I see PasteFormat & PasteFromScrapbook, but not PasteDestinationFormatting. I am using 12.2.8 (101117). <comment140871> The "PasteDestinationFormatting" does not provide unformatted text. It matches the text that is at the destination point. Unfortunately, stupid Word for some reason likes to create that destination format depending on its mood at the time. I just reassigned Command-V as per this hint, and Word pasted my text as 16pt bold text (all document text is Times New Roman 12 - explain to me how that happens?). <comment143430> I needed to use `Automator` to create a workflow which executed an applescript. Then I saved it with a .workflow extension, and it worked fine (albeit with a slight delay) <comment146347> How do you achieve this?
