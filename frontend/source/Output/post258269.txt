Why doesn't right-clicking Word in the dock list the windows open? <body> A problem that has annoyed me for months is that when I right-click the Microsoft Word icon in the dock, it doesn't list the windows open. They're just not there, unlike the other options.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BIIYa.png" alt="enter image description here"  This isn't a problem with PowerPoint though.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vlfYH.png" alt="enter image description here"  One day, it just stopped showing the windows in Word when I do this. I haven't been able a solution to this online, or in the Word settings. What to do? Switching windows (and I have lots open) is so tedious without this option. It's perhaps the #1 thing I miss about Windows.   <comment322824> Not a fix, but you can cycle through active windows using cmd/`  or cmd/shift/`[left of z on UK keyboards, I think left of 1 on US]
