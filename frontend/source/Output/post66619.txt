Disable Google Play Music menu bar icon <body> Is there a way to disable the Google Play Music icon in the menu bar, while keeping Google Play Music running?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IJIm.png" alt="Google Play Music Icon"  <answer66635> If you've already tried kbdCommand/kbd-dragging it out of the menu bar (although draggable menu itmes are a private API feature, as pointed out by comments below and usually only works with system icons like Time Machine, clock, battery, and volume), I'd recommend  h2Bartender (free in beta, $7 full version)/h2  Bartender allows you full control of your menu bar by adding a second, hidden but easily accessible menu bar to organize all of your icons. Alternatively, you could request that Broomstick (free) be updated for Google Play.  <comment78493> Draggable menu items are a private API feature. They are mostly system integrated menus such as clock, battery and volume and some, but rare, third-party applications like iStatMenu. <comment78525> right, editing answer accordingly; thank you @MaxRied
