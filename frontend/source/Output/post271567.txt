Whats wrong if 'Invalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block: 000000' <body> I have a corrupted partition and upon trying to repair it with codedisk utility/code it gives the error  precodeInvalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block: 000000 /code/pre  Several postings on the internet describe this problem related to a wrong partition type GUID. They mostly look at the problem from the perspective of having a NFS+ partition that eventually gets a wrong GUID.  My problem is different since this partition was/is a bootcamp partition.  precode$ sudo gdisk -l /dev/disk0 Password: GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded!
