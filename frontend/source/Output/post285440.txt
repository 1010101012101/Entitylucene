Time machine reports cannot complete backup to "drive name" after a few successful backups on airport <body> I have had this problem for many months now.  I have had the apple airport extremes for years and they have worked perfectly up until this year. Suddenly, time machine started reporting "cannot complete backup to "drive name"... start new backup.."  I have tried everything, erasing the disk and starting again being the final attempt to fix it.  This worked for a couple of days, then the message returned.  I then changed the disk to my daughters airport extreme to attempt to back up to it. Again, it worked for the first few backups, only to have it come up with the exact same message a few days later! Is it Time Machine that has the glitch, or is there something wrong with the Airport Extremes?  I don't want to spend $600 buying a new one only to have the same thing happen again! This is my business computer, so I am getting anxious about the lack of backups.
