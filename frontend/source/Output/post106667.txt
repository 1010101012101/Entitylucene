Podcasts deleted from iPhone 4 through iTunes never get deleted <body> I hook my iPhone 4 up to my MacBook and delete all the podcasts I've listened to. I get the confirmation box, "Are you sure you want to delete this from your iPhone?" and hit yes. Everything is peachy. But the podcasts are still on my phone. When I sync the two devices, they show back up in iTunes. This is incredibly frustrating, and just started happening recently. I have a measly 8GB iPhone, and it's filling up fast. Any ideas?
