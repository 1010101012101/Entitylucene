Can I put music files on an iPod without iTunes? <body> I can't find any definitive info on this and I need to know for sure before I purchase one.  I emhate/em iTunes with a burning passion, but I like iPods and I have a whole lot of music on my PC.  How can I move music from a Windows computer to iOS without using iTunes?  <answer87837> A google search for "iTunes alternatives" returns a lot of results. For example: http://www.copytrans.net/copytransmanager.php  <answer91052> use MediaMonkey.com :p you can manage everything from there  <answer104937> ul liOnce you plug in your iPod click on your iPod in the top right on iTunes./li liFrom there scroll down to options and once you see Manually strong"Manage Music and Videos"/strong tick that./li liThen click Sync in the bottom right./li liTo manually add music just select the songs and drag them over to your device./li liI'm assuming you have the newest version of iTunes so it may be easier to go strongView  Show Sidebar/strong (then it will look more like the older version and easier to manage)/li /ul  <comment102751> Side-stepping your question a bit.. are you planning to switch to a mac at any point soon? iTunes on mac is a very different experience thank iTunes on PC. I concur with the "hate" comment! <comment102762> I was not planning on it. I did a 1 year stint with Mac and ultimately accepted that I am just a Windows person. <comment102783> Wow, I've never heard that happen before! Usually it's a 'never look back' situation. Unless you tried it back in the OS9 days when it was terrible!
