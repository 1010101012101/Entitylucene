How to configure Apache for XAMPP on Mac OS X Lion to use mod_rewrite? <body> I am totally newbie when it comes to .htaccess or Apache. I don't know how it works.  My URLs are like codehttp://localhost/category.php?category=something/code and I'd like to get the variable value as strongemsomething/em/strong in codecategory.php/code but I'd like to show the URL as codehttp://localhost/something/code  How can I do this? Please help.  Thank you in advance.  <answer102896> I haven't tested this exact string but in your htaccess file you can try:  precodeOptions +FollowSymLinks  RewriteEngine On   RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(.*&amp;)category=([^&amp;]+)(&amp;.*)?$ [NC]   RewriteRule ^category\.php$ /%2? [R=301,L] /code/pre  How familiar are you with regular expressions?  That's probably the biggest hurdle to get over with mod_rewrite.    This particular version is intended to work for multiple parameters (optionally) and category can be first or not first.   The other parameters if present are just discarded -- they still sent to your php code, just don't appear in URL.
