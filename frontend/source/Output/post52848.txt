How do I click a button using AppleScript? <body> I'm trying to press a button in TeamSpeak using applescript, here is my code:  precodetell application "TeamSpeak 3 Client" to activate tell application "System Events"     tell process "TeamSpeak 3"         click menu item "Connect" of menu "Connections" of menu bar 1         delay 2         click button "Connect"     end tell end tell /code/pre  and here is an image of me hovering over the button in accessibility inspector  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2r1H6.png" alt="Accessibility Inspector inspecting a push button"  All I want to be able to do is figure out how to push my button using the information given to me in Accessibility Inspector, but with my code I get the error "System Events got an error: Canâ€™t get button "Connect" of process "TeamSpeak 3"." Here is a screenshot of the window the button is directly inside:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jTElH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer52859> You also need to specify the parent objects.  precodeactivate application "TeamSpeak 3 Client" tell application "System Events" to tell process "TeamSpeak 3"     click menu item "Connect" of menu "Connections" of menu bar 1     click button "Connect" of window 1 of window 1 end tell /code/pre  <comment60464> Thanks so much for your help! How do you know what window 1 is and menu bar 1 though, for instance, how do you know it's 1 when it could be window 2? Does it say so in the inspector? <comment60467> No, but you just have to guess (or run `UI elements of window 1`, `UI elements of window 1 of window 1`, etc). <comment60471> @user309641 If you know the title of the window you want to click the button in, you can loop through all the windows until you find the one with the correct title. <comment60501> @CajunLuke really? I'd love to learn how to do something like that. I'm going to need to start learning more about AppleScript! <comment167106> For some reason spammers are vandalizing this post. Flag it if anyone has a burning desire to edit / comment on it further. <comment219331> There is [UI Browser](http://pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/) tool which allow to figure our the GUI hierarchy, so it's easier to track the buttons.
