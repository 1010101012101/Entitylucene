Run script when logged out? <body> Is it possible to run a script emwhen and strongonly when/em/strong a user is logged out? Why I want to do this is so I can change the login message (codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText "Message"/code). Is there a way to do this?  <answer44747> Machints has got a sample script available here to write the logon and logoff events to a log file.  You basically need to write your script, give it execute rights and then add it to the codeLogoutHook/code event:     sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow \ LogoutHook /usr/local/bin/logoutscript   For some more advanced script you can also have a look here  strongAlternative solution/strong  Have a look at the launchd services. It's the built in service management system used by OSX. Some suggestions are to have launchd monitor a file, and using the logoutHook above, touch the file, which will trigger launchd to run. In the launchd job you can sleep the process for a few seconds to ensure that logout is completed.  Not the ideal solution, but could work.  <answer44769> You can change your login screen text, no need to run a script if this is a one-time or infrequent change. You have to add the key  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FA3oG.png" alt="enter image description here"  to /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist either with a text editor or by a terminal command which does the same thing.  This article describes both ways.  <answer44837> See here for how to run a script: How can I run/stop/relaunch an application automatically, at boot/login/some other time?  Have your script check if user logged in. If yes, exit. If no, do your thing.   <comment50891> Do you mean "upon logout" or "while logged out"? <comment50899> @JRobert While logged out <comment50900> That wasn't what I was looking for. Instead of running while I was logged off, it ran while I was logging off. <comment50908> @CoffeeRain Added a potentail workaround. Not entirely sure how vaiable it but worth investigating. <comment50984> possible duplicate of [How can I run/stop/relaunch an application automatically, at boot/login/some other time?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-can-i-run-stop-relaunch-an-application-automatically-at-boot-login-some-oth) <comment51058> See [Make a script/app run on logout](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/16831/4408).
