Can I Enter Sleep Mode While Downloading File? <body> When I try to enter my rMBP into sleep mode while downloading file via iTunes U, the downloaded file is aborted. Is it possible to enter sleep mode while keep downloading the file?  EDIT: Until I find better option I put my display to sleep and not the computer. Check this to see how quickly enter this mode: What Is the Keyboard Shortcut for Sleep Display Without Eject Key?  <answer59715> If you put your computer to sleep all processing (including downloads) is stopped - so no, you can't do that.  Putting the display to sleep (as mentioned in the question) is possible though.  <answer59716> Have a Mac in sleep mode while also downloading a file with iTunes, is currently not possible.  However the idea is not out the question, doing things while in sleep is possible on certain new Mac hardware running OS X 10.8, via the new Power Nap feature.   What you asking to do is currently not a feature of Power Nap, however it is something that might be possible with a hack or a future version of  Power Nap.

You can change the screen sleep to whatever you want.  Have a rMBP to and I do this when I'm downloading a huge file that takes more than 30 minutes to download.  <comment68727> I'm not sure I understand the question. Do you expect the download to continue while sleeping? <comment68728> Yes, I want to keep downloading while sleeping. <comment68745> Yep, I too think PowerNap will allow it, especially for iTunes as it part of OS X. <comment68749> Seems to only work for Mac App Store downloads currently, not for iTunes. <comment88516> Yep, that's my solution too.
