time machine doesn't go back <body> I enter the time machine. I select a folder in finder. I see red bars on the right. If I try to click a red bar, scroll or click up/down arrows, nothing happens. It looks like I can't go back in time.  I tried to leave the TM open for a while. Nothing.  I tried other folders, same result.  I'm on Yosemite. Never had problem before, but now of course, I need really the data  <comment369547> I experience this with a nearly full Time Machine that goes way back. Sometimes I just have to wait a long time before folders become populated. Other times I have to close Time Machine and try again. Itâ€™s a bit wobbly, but my data eventually shows up. <comment369561> `time machine doesn't go back` Vote to move to physics SE.
