"Messages" Account theme or logo <body> I am using "Messages" app for the first time. I have configured multiple accounts (google and jabber) in it.  Now I want to be able to group the buddy list by account type. Right now all my contacts from google and jabber are mixed up. So it' very difficult to tell who is coming from which source.  Also, in the messaging window, is there any way to setup a theme per account? or can the messaging window have a logo of the account? I am expecting to have a google logo on messaging window when I am talking to a google contact.  I know these requirements are pointless for a home user, but when you have a lot of contacts, it becomes a mess.
