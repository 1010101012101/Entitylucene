Mac Book Pro 2013 battery <body> I got a new Mac Book Pro, (not retina) and the battery indicator is only showing 98%.  Is this something of concern?   I have found this:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4228218?start=0&amp;tstart=0     Sit and watch it constantly, this will take some hours, it will charge to 100% from time to time, usually just a little less (like 98, or 96) in order to protect the battery from overcharging.   But I was looking for something official, but couldn't find it. And the official "battery link" doesn't say anything about this:  http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html  <answer94453> I haven't found "official" information on this, both my 2007 Macbook and my 2011 Macbook Pro will rarely show a 100% charge, I assume it's normal behaviour.  Take into account that the battery measurement is only an estimate so even if it shows 100% it does not mean that the battery has reached emexactly/em full charge.
