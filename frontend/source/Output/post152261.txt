How to get the first name of the recipient to be auto-added to new messages in Mail.app? <body> I'd like new messages that I create, including replies to messages I receive, to automatically get a "codeHi &lt;name&gt;,/code" inserted in their first line. code&lt;name&gt;/code should be the first name of the first recipient.  How can I create such an automation?  <answer152267> You can implement a mail merge using AppleScript. Gianugo Rabellino shared his initial AppleScript for creating such messages in Poor man’s mail merge in Apple Mail.  The comments on Rabellino's post suggest improvements and other approaches.  Bryan Klein's Applescript for Simple “Apple Mail” Merge Feature builds on the AppleScript and provides a copy to download.
