Can I route music that's playing on my computer into Facetime? <body> I'm using facetime with a headset, while also listening to music.  How do I play the music I'm listening to my friend, over facetime?  <comment113885> I've tried using JackOSX, but it doesn't list any of Facetime, Songbird or Chrome as input or output devices, when I'm using any of them. <comment113901> To be able to live stream (route) your music you will need a direct connection/access to your friends computer, something like Remote Sharing. That is since you use headset, if you were to use your speaker than it is no problem.
