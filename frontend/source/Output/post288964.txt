XQuartz does not work correctly <body> I have got a problem with XQuartz. We are running a server on which we installed an application which runs via Wine. If I start the application via Linux it works perfect.  But with my Macbook (OS X Sierra 10.12.5) it does not start. I connect to the server with ssh -X serverID, after this I try to start the application with ./"appname" and it happens just nothing. In the background XQuartz has already started while I was connecting to the server, but then it does not do anything. No error messages, nothing. Just a little freeze. If I try to open xeyes, this app starts but without the animation of the Iris. Someone who can help me?  <answer288988> Please try by providing /full_path/appname on the Terminal, Where full_path is the path which the particular appname is located.  <comment364965> Are you starting this from Terminal or from an xterm window, from within XQuartz? I find that sometimes you have to start x11 processes from xterm. <comment364972> It does not care actually. Neither terminal nor xterm works and same problems. If I want to start xeyes on xterm it works perfectly. After I connect to server via ssh -X nothing works. <comment365036> Does not work. Now my Terminal does not freeze anymore, but the application still does not start. <comment365040> Connect with -Y instead <comment365143> Is there any messages appearing on the terminal after running application.Please check Xquartz - preferences ,may be after changing some color settings it will work. For me i was having an Xquartz app that will work only with 256 color mode. <comment365251> No messages appearing. I type ./"scriptname" and it does just nothing. Also this does not work. Still, before connecting I test just "xeyes" or "xclock" and it works. After I connect to the server it does not work. The application does not work, too. <comment366751> No does not work also. I tried to debug that even xcalc is not opened and there is nothing suspicious:  user@server:~$ xcalc: debug1: client_input_channel_open: ctype x11 rchan 3 win 65536 max 16384 debug1: client_request_x11: request from ::1 54364 debug2: fd 7 setting O_NONBLOCK debug1: channel 1: new [x11] debug1: confirm x11
