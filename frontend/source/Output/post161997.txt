I want to create a new calendar "on my mac" but the item is missing in calendar.app v. 8 <body> I have migrated to Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Sometimes I use an 'on my mac' calendar. I just wanted to create one for one of my projects, but I can only see "Exchange", "google" and "iCloud" but I don't want any of those, just a local one.   The menu item is not there anymore. What setting am I missing?  <answer162034> To create local calendar on Yosemite (when no such option is available via strongFile/strong menu) navigate to calendar in strongOther/strong section in the sidebar, select one and strongright click/strong, then select strongNew Calendar/strong. This should create calendar in strongOn My Mac/strong section (local).  <answer182503> As an addendum to the above, if the strongOther/strong section is not visible in the sidebar, go to strongPreferences/strong and select the strongGeneral/strong icon.  Now select the strongShow Birthdays Calendar/strong or strongShow Holidays Calendar/strong (or both) and close the strongPreferences/strong pane. The strongOther/strong section is now added embelow/em the strongiCloud/strong section.  You can now right-click in the strongOther/strong section, select strongNew Calendar/strong and an emuntitled/em calendar is created in the strongOn My Mac/strong section emabove/em the strongiCloud/strong section.  I find this very useful if I need an application to run at a specific time each day on one specific Mac and not on any others. This also prevents alerts from appearing on other devices such as iPhone or iPad where they would have no significance.  <answer203219> The other answers didn't work for me until I hid all the other calendar groups by hovering over them to show the hide button. Then I right clicked to create a new calendar.  <answer222062> If you first turn off your iCloud account using the System Preferences control panel, an "On My Mac" option appears in the File  New Calendar menu. A new calendar can then be created under a new "On My Mac" group.  <comment189281> Does right click on the sidebar with calendars and choosing "New Calendar" is what You're asking? I'm not sure I understand the question. <comment189284> I go to "File"-"New Calendar" - "...". There used to be an "On my computer" item. but I only see iCloud, Google or exchange there...   In the calendar sidebar there is no "on my mac" section.. <comment189287> Do You have any calendar under "Other" category? If Yes try selecting it and then right click on sidebar and choose New Calendar. I can create local (on my mac) calendar with this method. <comment189297> WOW, yes.. it appeared. And now I also have the menu item under new... <comment249573> As referenced in [Steve Moser's reply below](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/203219/94024), you may need to hide other calendar groups before this menu item appears. I had to collapse them all then right-click in the gray empty area of the sidebar.
