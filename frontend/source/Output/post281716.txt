USB external hard drive suddenly refuses to mount? <body> I am unable (as of today) to access an external hard-drive (The USB variant). It does not or will not show under my Devices directory in Finder. If I open codeDisk Utility/code, the application will forever tell me it is loading the drives unless I unplug the external and plug it in after opening the application (at which point it shows nothing).   I then tried running codediskutil/code in the terminal to see if the drive was being recognized somewhere. And it is, kind of:  precodeCXR-MBP13:~ Owatch$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            120.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +120.1 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  BFDF1A89-7E29-4DEE-92E8-143DA7D4563C                                  Unlocked Encrypted /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk2    1:                  Apple_HFS CXExternal              500.1 GB   disk2s1 /code/pre  It's listed as codedisk2s1/code. My external is named strongCXExternal/strong.  I tried running codeverifyVolume/code on the drive to see if it could tell me anything:  precodeCXR-MBP13:~ Owatch$ diskutil verifyVolume CXExternal Started file system verification on disk2s1 CXExternal Verifying file system File system check exit code is 8 Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed /code/pre  I cannot seem to do any more than this. I thought perhaps I should be using codeverifyDisk/code and tried that, but nothing seems to get me anywhere. What can I do apple.stackexchange? I want to be able to access this external. You're my only hope.  <comment356731> Do you still have this problem? If you do, have you backed up your data/is the data on that drive unimportant? <comment356737> @MythicCocoa The problem was never solved. The data was recovered via accessing the drive through Ubuntu, which could mount it for some reason. It was never possible to fix the issue on macOS though. So I have not marked it solved as the problem was never truly solved that way. Maybe someone will post something eventually which would help others searching for this specific problem. <comment356739> Try to reformat the disk
