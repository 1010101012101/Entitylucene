Random latency ping spikes <body> So I have been having serious problems with lag(connection ping spikes) on my computer.  I am using Mac Pro (Mid 2010), and I used the “sudo ping -i .2 192.168.0.1” command in terminal to monitor my ping. My ping stays constant at 1ms-3ms, but always rises to 100ms-200ms every 6 to 15 seconds. And these “spikes” happens literally every 6 to 15 seconds, but it doesn’t go crazy until 1000 ping or even over.  The lag hits me a lot since I am playing Counter-Strike Global Offence on Mac, which the ping spike can be clearly felt.  The weird thing is that I am not running any program that uploads or downloads, and the lag only happens in this specific computer.The lag doesn’t happen on my laptop and all. What is going on? My speculation of this problem is probably my computer appears to be sending out files or signals hiddenly, and this is when the ping rises, but I just can’t figure out what is going on.   The connection used to be fine. Is it a problem with hidden network features within my Mac or what? I was about to try to disable SSDP service, which seemed to be the cause of lag of few of my friends, but I just don’t know how to, since its Mac.  Any help would be appreciated.  <comment269248> Are you using wired ethernet or wifi? If wifi, try wiring up & see if it improves; that way we've something to work with. <comment358137> I have this exact same problem, and had it for at least 3-4 months. I'm fairly certain it's an issue with something on the mac itself. I've done pings directly to my router, on the wifi, from my laptop, and my phone - only the laptop sees it. Furthermore, 2.4ghz is horrendous, 5ghz bandwidth is still bad, but drops out less.
