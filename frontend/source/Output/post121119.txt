How to Steam Video from iPhone to WiFi-Enabled HDTV <body> Just bought my first wifi-enabled HDTV.  I have a feeling this is a "duh!" question, but I can't find a clear answer.  Is it possible to stream a video from my iPhone to the HDTV?  I've heard of Chromecast, Apple TV, Roku, and various iOS apps but I'm not clear if / how any of them would do what I want.  <answer121120> If your tv can act as a DLNA client (specifically it should be a DMR - Digital Media Renderer) you should be able to do it with [ArkMC] app for iPhone1. Haven't tried it though.  <comment141173> Apple TV wil allow you to do most things you would want, but you would have to purchase it for additional costs (Â£100 in the UK). I don't think that's what you're after?
