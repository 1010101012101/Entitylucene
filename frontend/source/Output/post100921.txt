Full screen mode for non-Cocoa applications? <body> Is there any way to hack a full screen mode in non-Cocoa applications?  For instance, Wineskin or ported applications that run in X11 will probably never get support to run in its own space.  <comment118815> There is a SIMBL plugin called megazoomer, but the website of the original version has been removed, and I couldn't get the fork at https://github.com/roidrage/megazoomer to work on 10.8 either. <comment118950> megazoomer 0.5 still works for me in OS X 10.8.4 â€” but only in Cocoa applications and it doesn't provide a separate full screen space.
