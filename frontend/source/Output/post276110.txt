Keynote 'universal' font size change? <body> I'm building out a presentation using Keynote 6.6.2, on a Mac. It's all type right now, no graphics, and I want to change the font size. Is there a way to do this on a 'universal basis,' throughout the presentation all at once? (I tried 'Select All' under Edit, but this doesn't seem to lead to a solution.)  <comment347444> Welcome to Ask Different. Unfortunately, your question as it currently reads doesn't provide enough detail for us to answer definitively. Could you edit your question (there's an _edit_ link below it) to provide additional info such as what version of Keynote you're using, whether it's on a Mac, iPad, iPhone, and finally what (if anything) you've already tried?
