Why doesn't Numbers remember my last cell position? <body> For latest release of Numbers for iPad, it seems that it doesn't remember the active cell when I close the spreadsheet.  I have spreadsheets with many (several hundred) rows and in previous releases, when I close and then re-open the sheet, it would remember what cell I had been in and display at that point again.  Now, every time I close and re-open the sheet, it displays a cell somewhere near the top of the sheet and I then have to swipe loads of times to get back to the bottom where I want to add a new row.   Has anyone else noticed this behavior and do you have a solution?  Many thanks  <answer215305> It appears that this was a known issue.  The latest version released today (2015-11-11) Version 2.6.1 has this note:     ul   liResolves and issue where spreadsheets would not open back to their last saved positions./li   /ul   See if updating to this latest version solves your issue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6mmwJ.png" alt="Release notes Numbers 2.6.1"
