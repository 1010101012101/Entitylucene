How to delete files on iMac with no menus -- Your startup disk is full <body> I have an iMac with the 10.4 OSX operating system installed.  When I boot the computer it prompts me with this message:  "Your startup disk is full.  You need to make more space available on your disk by deleting files".  I am able to login and see the desktop background, but I cannot see any menus.    How can I delete files or erase all the data?  I have the startup disks but when I hold down C as the disks instructions say, nothing when I reboot.    <answer82594> Try deleting files in single user mode:  ul liRestart/li liHold âŒ˜S after hearing the startup sound (it doesn't work if I start holding it before the computer has restarted)/li liRun codemount -uw //code (codefsck -fy/code is not needed)/li liRun something like coderm -r /Users/username/.Trash//code/li licodereboot/code/li /ul  <comment95302> It's prompting me for "override rw-rw-rw 501/staff for /foldername/filename/here.extension"  I've pressed "Y" and enter on each file but after reboot, I'm still out of space.  I ran the command again, but all of the same files get prompted again for this questions.  Any ideas? <comment95304> I'm also trying: rm -rf /Users/username/.Trash/ But it's coming back with the "Read-only file system" comment on each file <comment95306> It worked for me (on 10.8). The `-w` option of `mount -uw /` should mount the filesystem as writable. <comment95308> Somehow I missed the trailing "/" on the mount -uw command.  Thanks, that worked!
