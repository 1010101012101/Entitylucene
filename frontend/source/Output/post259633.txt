macOS Sierra: Configuring Subversion/SVN on Apache <body> Every Mac OSX/macOS update brings further challenges to get svn working after the update.  Sierra's the latest.  I have a subversion repo in code~/svnRepo/code  I run some windows development stuff in a VM running on code172.16.99.4/code which can connect to the Mac host using codehttp://172.16.99.1/code.  I use Tortoise and Visual Studio.  Normally I build the SVN server on the Mac using the current method.  Last time I 'brewed' my own.  Sierra has codesubversion/code running,  e.g. codeterminal&gt; svnadmin info ~/svnRepo/code returns info about the repository.  Questions:   ol liIs it possible to use the native subversion server to serve up subversion to the VM?   /li liMust another subversion server be installed and configured on Apache?/li liHow can Sierra be configured to connect to my pre-existing repo?/li liIs there  a quick and easy way doing this?/li /ol  <answer259674> Yes, you can run a native subversion server on your Mac to serve your virtual machines.  If your virtual machines can access services on your Mac, as your question suggests they can, then you can offer a subversion service natively on your Mac.  h1svnserve/h1  The easiest approach is to use subversion's standalone server, codesvnserve/code:     The svnserve program is a lightweight server, capable of speaking to clients over TCP/IP using a custom, stateful protocol. Clients contact an svnserve server by using URLs that begin with the codesvn:///code or codesvn+ssh:///code scheme. This section will explain the different ways of running svnserve, how clients authenticate themselves to the server, and how to configure appropriate access control to your repositories.   A copy of codesvnserve/code is included with Xcode:  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svnserve /code/pre  codesvnserve/code does not require an Apache codehttpd/code instance or any other server to work. The codesvnserve/code process listens and handles connections from codesvn/code clients.  h2Security Considerations/h2  You can add tunnelling over codessh/code and other approaches to add security. Without additional configuration, a plain codesvnserve/code instance is not recommended for exposure to the Internet; it is not secure by default.  However, for your local-only situation codesvnserve/code is likely enough.  <comment325001> `svnserve -d -r ~/svnRepo` seems to be just the ticket. Much easier than configuring apache, etc. <comment325002> How does one configure the Mac firewall to enable the SVN port (3690)?  - or should I ask another question? <comment325036> Good to hear `svnserve` works for you. If you could ask another question about the firewall, you will attract better, more focused, answers. <comment325086> Asked this question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259796/macos-sierra-10-12-configure-firewall-for-a-single-port-3690 (my previous link was wrong!)
