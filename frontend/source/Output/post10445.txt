What is the function of /home in Snow Leopard? <body> I would like to mirror the directory structure that I have on my linux machine at work. There, my home directory resides in code/home/emiller/code rather than code/Users/emiller/code as it does on Snow Leopard.  I was intending to create code/home/emiller/code and use it as a sshfs mount point for my files on the linux machine - thus permitting to me run all my scripts without having to change any paths.  However, when I try to codemkdir /home/emiller/code, I get:  codemkdir: /home/emiller: Operation not supported/code  Why is this? What is the function of code/home/code? It appears empty of all files.   ~emiller  <answer10447> It's got an NFS automounter map mounted on it, so NFS home directories will be automatically available there.  Quoting codeman auto_master/code:     The codeauto_master/code file contains a list of the directories that are to be   automounted.  Associated with each directory is the name of a map that   lists the locations of the filesystems to be automounted there.  The   default map looks like this:  precode# # Automounter master map # +auto_master            # Use directory service /net                    -hosts          -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home                   auto_home       -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers        -fstab /-                      -static /code/pre   The default codeauto_home/code on SL expects to get the home directory-to-machine mapping from NIS or LDAP, but you can add entries manually.  You can remove the codeauto_home/code line from code/etc/auto_master/code and codesudo killall automountd/code (which should cause codelaunchd/code to rerun it with the new map) or reboot.  Alternately, add your codesshfs/code mount to code/etc/auto_home/code (and again restart codeautomountd/code or reboot).  <comment10986> If I could vote your post up I would...
