Windows 10 USB3 drivers for MacBook <body> I am trying to get a Tobii EyeX eye tracker working on my MacBook Air mid 2012.  Unfortunately Tobii have only provided support for Windows systems, so I'm trying to get around this by using a Windows 10 VM running on VMWare Fusion.  The USB keeps disconnecting. There seem to be many documented problems with the USB, and the advice is to find the correct USB3 Driver for your hardware.  But I don't have a clue where to find such drivers.  My only thought is that maybe Boot Camp contains these drivers. Is there any way to get them without having to install a complete Windows system using Boot Camp, and then digging around in the filesystem &amp; hardware profile?  I found https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1720?locale=en_US which offers a download, saying it is valid for "...64 bit versions of Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1".  I'm going to give that a go, but is there anything better?  EDIT: Unpacking that download I find ./BootCamp5/BootCamp/Drivers/Intel/IntelxHCISetup.exe which fails with "this computer does not meet the minimum requirements for installing the software"  This is frustrating. I have installed VMWare Tools and have allocated 5 gigs RAM, 60 gigs HDD and tried both 2 and 4 cores. My processor is 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5.
