How to hide specific shares in the sidebar from Finder? <body> I want to hide some specific shares in the sidebar from Finder because I never access them and it get's confusing if everyone in my local network is online.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4zQH.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to hide for example only the shares marked with the red arrow?  <answer155522> Just drag the icon outside of the sidebar.  <answer155603> Sharing is caring. Here's the solution to my 'problem'. Just go to codeFinder -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Sidebar/code and unclick the two points marked with the red arrows. From now on only the mounted shares will be listed in the sidebar of Finder. :)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DwPc0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210784> Rename the share to ".name" and it will be invisible in the Finder.  <comment182875> These are not Shared. They are mounted devices on your Mac. <comment182877> 'Bautz' is mounted, the other ones definitely aren't.
