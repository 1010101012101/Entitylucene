App problems with my iPad <body> Ok, if you change your Apple ID and you still have all the old apps... Could you delete a game for example clash of clans. And say you re download it using your new Apple ID will your progess still be saved? Thanks for the help!!   <answer193958> Depending where the game saves it's progress. If ONLY locally on the device, then it'll get deleted when deleting the app. If it saves it's settings in it's own cloud service, then it's no problem. If it saves it on iCloud, you'll have to keep your old iCloud address signed in but you can download the game with a different AppleID  <comment231283> Have a look at the volumes of Clash of Clans questions on the site and see if you can narrow this down. We'll probably not be able to answer a customer support question without documented versions of the app and a clear statement of how you'll be saving and restoring the game progress across the reinstall.
