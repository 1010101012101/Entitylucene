Reason for root `/private` heirarchy <body> What is the reason for the code/private/code directory structure located at the root of an OSX system volume?  Why are code/etc/code, code/tmp/code, and code/var/code symlinks to subdirectories of code/private/code?  strongNOTE/strong While writing my question, I discovered this answer to another question which seems to address this issue.  I'm going to post my question anyway because it contains the terms that I searched for.  The other question/answer doesn't, prompting me to start writing this question in the first place.  <answer139289> This answer to another, more specific question explains that this directory structure quirk is a vestige of OSX's NextStep heritage.  <comment164269> I'm going to close this as a duplicate. Don't worry though, your question will still show up in search so anybody searching along the same search terms as you did will still find your question.
