Make Mac boot upon plugging in power <body> I have a MacBook and I'd like it to boot automatically upon plugging it into a power source. Is there a way to do this?  <answer225309> strongNo./strong It's just not designed to do this: it doesn't have the necessary hardware for lights-out management nor built in features.  <answer225325> You have the option to use the MacBook in "strongdocking mode/strong" (I don't know wether there is an official name for this), which works under these conditions:  ul lian external Display is connected/li lithe lid of the MacBook is closed/li lithe power supply is connected/li lifor usability's sake: have additional mouse &amp; keyboard connected/li /ul  Now when you disconnect the power source, the MacBook automatically goes to sleep. As soon as you reconnect the power source, it wakes up.  However I have only ever tried this with a booted MacBook, so I don't know if it works for a fully shut down device. I guess not, but it may be worth a try.  <comment273261> It's really only designed to do that after a power-fail.
