Remapping Specific Channels from External Soundcard to Soundflower <body> I have a DJ controller that consists of an external soundcard. It uses channels 9 and 10 as a left and right  (stereo) out. I want to stream the audio from these two channels.  I've tried a couple of open source streaming apps (particularly interested in Butt) and while I can select the audio device, I can't choose the channels so there's no audio being streamed.  I've tried Soundflower and Soundflower bed (which looks like it would achieve this for output channels but not input channels).  I've also looked at aggregate audio devices but haven't been able to remap the channels.  Is there a way to achieve this? Or alternatively, is there a lightweight, open source streaming app that will allow me to select specific audio channels from a device and encode and stream MP3/Ogg etc to a Shoutcast/Icecast server.
