Create list of Safari bookmarks <body> I want to create a list of my Safari bookmarks (folder, webpage title, and URL) to put into Numbers or a database app. This will help me find duplicates, tell me where a certain bookmark is, and keep from saving bookmarks again and again.   <answer296253> strongSafari/strong Bookmarks can be exported as an HTML file.
