iOS Wi-Fi sync won't work in VirtualBox <body> I am trying to set up Wi-Fi sync of my iPod Touch (iOS 5) with iTunes 10.5.0.142 running on Windows XP.  They sync fine over the USB cable. I've enabled Wi-Fi sync both on the iPod and in iTunes. The Wi-Fi is functioning and I can ping the Windows XP machine from the iPod. However, the Wi-Fi sync won't work (the sync app on the iPod doesn't see the computer).  How do I go about troubleshooting this?  Notes:  ol liWindows XP is running inside VirtualBox on Ubuntu./li liI've checked out other similar questions, and none of them are relevant here./li /ol  <answer28422> I seem to have been able to figure this one out. In VirtualBox, select codeDevices/code/codeNetwork Adapters/code, and change codeAttached to/code from codeNAT/code to codeBridged Adapter/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZlpEv.png" alt="VirtualBox preferences"  Click codeOK/code. Finally, reboot Windows and cold-restart the iPod.  This has fixed it for me.  <comment32719> Since this question has little to do with the iPod and iTunes and more to do with Ubuntu and Windows, it isn't really on topic for Ask Different. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment32770> @NathanGreenstein: Whether or not this question gets closed makes no difference to me, except providing a disincentive to post again. However, for the record, it is clearly the Apple's products that are malfunctioning in a perfectly legit (if slightly obscure) setup. I therefore think the question has *everything* to do with this site.
