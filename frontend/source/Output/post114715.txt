Simulate CTRL+F12 2 second keypress <body> Im trying to bring up the OS X shutdown dialogue box by simulating the key press kbdControl/kbd+kbdF12/kbd for 2 seconds (using a logitech keyboard). No matter how much I try I just can not get it to work.   My latest script looks like this:  precodeon run     tell application "System Events"         key down {key code 111 , key code 59}         delay 2.0         key up {key code 111 , key code 59}     end tell end run /code/pre  This should work and does work if I press kbdControl/kbd+kbdF12/kbd for 2 seconds on my keyboard, so can someone tell my why it doesn't work when called via applescript?  <answer114746> Rather than simulating a keyboard shortcut, you can simply call the shutdown dialog itself with the following AppleScript:  precodetell application "loginwindow" to «event aevtrsdn» /code/pre  …or for the restart dialog:  precodetell application "loginwindow" to «event aevtrrst» /code/pre  <comment134394> Why not make a script which directly calls the shutdown dialogue instead of one that simulates the shortcut that triggers it? <comment134667> Thats exactly what i want to do, the two examples below work for shut down and reset respectively but i want to call the event that brings up the same box as ctrl-f12, with the options for "Reset, Sleep, Cancel & Shutdown". does anybody know the correct event name to call ?"loginwindow"
