Safari Web proxy <body> I have a question about setting proxies in Safari for the Mac. In Network preferences one can configure a Web proxy - HTTP, which has the field: "Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts&amp;Domains". Is there a way to bypass any host or domain, but apply proxy only to one specific host?  EDIT: Found a good link about that - http://nscsysop.hypermart.net/proxypac.html  <answer40895> Don't know too much about this, but I've used glimmerblocker.org to muck around with the  appearance of a few individual sites (via tweaking their css). I know Glimmer Blocker is far more powerful than that, so it might be of some help to you.  <answer40908> You should not use the Web proxy, but to use the Automatic Proxy Configuration, and setup a .pac file.  In this file, you specify which domain/hosts you want the proxy.  Check wiki, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config, for more information.  A sample may looks like:  precodefunction FindProxyForURL(url, host)  {   PROXY = "PROXY 127.0.0.1:8000";   DEFAULT = "DIRECT";    var domain_list = [     "blahblahblah.com"   ];    for (var i = domain_list.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--){     if (dnsDomainIs(host,domain_list[i])) {return PROXY}   }; } /code/pre  The other simple way is to use the Firefox, and install an extension, Autoproxy.  <comment46324> I've been looking for a native way of doing this operation, but thanx for your proposal :)
