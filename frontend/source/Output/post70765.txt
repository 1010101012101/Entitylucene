Why does my MBP say it was restarted "because of a problem"? <body> Since upgrading my MBP from Lion to Mountain Lion, every time I restart (planned restart, with nothing abnormal - I even close all applications before selecting Restart), my MacBook briefly shows the message "Your computer restarted because of a problem" when booting. Then, once I've logged in, I also see a dialog that says "Your computer was restarted because of a problem". As far as I know, there is no problem; everything seems to be working normally.  How can I begin to diagnose or get rid this? It's merely a cosmetic issue, I think, but it is annoying. I have read this Apple support document, but that only seems to be relevant in the scenario where the Mac crashed because of a kernel panic. As far as I know, mine didn't.  <answer75257> Resetting my NVRAM / PRAM appears to have resolved the problem.  <answer127853> I had the same annoying issue on OSX Mavericks (10.9.2), and resetting the NVRAM / PRAM as per Andrew Ferrier's answer didn't resolve it.  Instead, I opened a Terminal window and found a week old Kernel code.panic/code file in code/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports//code  I simply renamed it to code.panic.old/code with the following command:  precodesudo mv Kernel_[rest_of_filename].panic Kernel_[rest_of_filename].panic.old /code/pre  After a reboot I no longer get the annoying message!  <answer272729> I found that you can receive this issue by holding down your power-button to restart it. Are you hitting the restart button in OS X, or are you just holding down the power button?  <comment82185> Does your Console.app log tell you anything more about the problem?
