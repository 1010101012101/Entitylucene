To list all search results in Hex Fiend? <body> The viewer Hex Fiend nicely shows searches here. However, I want to be able to list all search results such that I can analyze how the search result changes.  In the manual, it says that Hex Fiend can be integrated into terminal tools so it should be possible to list also those results.  I contacted the developer already.   How can you list all hexadecimal search results in Hex Fiend?   <comment229691> Contacted the developer? What did the developer have to say? <comment229701> "Hex Fiend is available as a framework for embedding into your apps", this doesn't imply that the functionality you are looking for is available in the application itself. <comment229707> @Tyson The developer has not yet answered. I provided the link to this discussion too.
