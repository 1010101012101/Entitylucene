Git not working over AFP <body> I've got a git repository on my file server which I'm connecting to via AFP.  Whenever I try to do a git operation on the shared repository, such as staging a file, I get the following error message:  precodefatal: Unable to write new index file /code/pre  If I execute the git command on the server it works fine, so there's something about sharing the repository via AFP that's not working.  I'm using Mountain Lion on both the server and the client.  strongUPDATE/strong  I seem to have write permission for both code.git/code and code.git/index/code:  precode$ ls -ld .git drwxr-xr-x  1 david  staff  364 Nov 29 22:38 .git/ $ ls -l .git/index -rw-r--r--  1 david  staff  2232 Nov 29 21:45 .git/index $ cp .git/index backup $ echo change &gt;&gt; .git/index /code/pre  I tried recursively applying permissions to code.git/code as suggested by an answer below, but that didn't help:  precode$ chmod -Rv +w .git $ git add deploy.js  fatal: Unable to write new index file /code/pre  Hmm, it looks like someone else is using the codeindex/code file:  precode$ cp .git/index backup; mv backup .git/index mv: rename backup to .git/index: Resource busy /code/pre  But codefuser/code and codelsof/code aren't of any help:  precode$ fuser -fu .git/index .git/index:  $ lsof .git/index /code/pre  Weird workaround:  If I do the following command on the emserver/em, it allows me to write a new codeindex/code file on the client over AFP.  precode$ cp .git/index backup; mv backup .git/index /code/pre  I'm totally lost at this point; any new theories?  <answer111936> strongThe error indicates that it can't write to code.git/index/code/strong, which usually means that it can't write to code.git/code either.  Make sure that you have permission to code.git/code and recursively apply such permissions to the contents of the folder and subfolders, and new files that are created.  <answer173491> I get this intermittently, and typing git status on the remote host fixes it for me.  <answer175073> We've run into the same issue repeatedly, especially as we try to use XCode 6. I'm currently changing over my connect to our server to WebDAV (connecting to our server via Finder  Go (menubar)  Connect to Server...  https://localnetworkIP/userfolder/).  This is working for us (so far).  UPDATE: After a few days, I noticed a new issue using WebDAV: files would disappear from view in the Finder causing XCode/Git to think that the file had been deleted. Looking at the server showed that the files were still there.  I then changed my connection type to SMB. This has worked well for me: Git no longer encounters file permission errors, and Finder (OSX 10.10 Yosemite) doesn't "loose" files.  <comment131824> Good guess, but I seem to have permission.  Please see the update to my question. <comment204149> Thanks, I'm not using Git over AFP any more but I'll try your idea the next time I do.
