Terminal command to arrange all files/folders by name on hard drive <body> Looking to tidy up my iMac.  Like everyone, I have lots of files/folders on my iMac. When they get dragged and dropped, or moved around, they retain their position, and the only way to fix this is to right click on the mouse select 'Clean up By'  'Name'  I'm wanting to run a script in Terminal (or similar) that will do this to every file/folder on my iMac  E.g. Directory X contains four files  ABC99, ABC45, ABC32, ABC01  After running the script, the folder should contain the same files but in the correct order  ABC01, ABC32, ABC45, ABC99  <answer187972> To clean up your ementire/em hard drive (starting from mount point code//code), you can use:  precode$ sudo find / "-name" ".DS_Store" -exec rm {} \; /code/pre  <answer188382> Deleting .DS_Store SHOULD reset the appearance of a folder's content.   BTW, the problem with the other answer could be the handling of special characters, which in my guess is codespace/code.   For example, you have a home directory named "First Last". In codefind/code, the result it pipes out would be:  precode/Users/First Last/.DS_Store /code/pre  etc. Try,  precoderm /Users/First Last/.DS_Store /code/pre  would end in error, because the two properly escaped forms are:  precoderm  /Users/First\ Last/.DS_Store /code/pre  or  precoderm "/Users/First Last/.DS_Store" /code/pre  The correct way to go about it should be: run  precodefind / -name ".DS_Store" /code/pre  first to list all code.DS_Store/code files. (Don't mind the codePermission Denied/code.) Then  precodefind / -name ".DS_Store" -delete /code/pre  to delete all that you saw. Then  precodefind / -name ".DS_Store" /code/pre  again to confirm.  codesudo/code is excessive. Unless you have used "sudo open -a Finder; killall Finder" before. A user's Finder has not have permission necessary to create code.DS_Store/code files in code/Library/code, code/System/code, etc.  <comment222338> Thanks, but I already use that command to remove all the .DS_Store files. I'm trying to clean-up the files in all the folders on my hard drive. <comment222340> Which files do you want to remove/clean up now? You could use the said command to remove them as well. <comment222341> By clean up, I mean to arrange in order of name. <comment222350> ah, got it, you want to automatically run "Clean up - by name" for every folder in Finder. Hmm, might require an Applescript solution... <comment222352> @DavePearce What app are you wanting to see the files in order in? If you remove the .DS_Store file doesn't the finder show then in order? If not what order does it show them in? <comment222367> @Mark When I remove the .DS_Store file, the folders appear to retain their positions and no change is made. <comment222368> Sounds good to me, any ideas?
