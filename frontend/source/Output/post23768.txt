Where can I find this old app: Biorhythms by Andrew Regan <body> The most recent version if possible. Maybe you have it ?  The developer's site has disappeared, here's the MacUpdate page.  <answer24454> You can download it right from MacUpdate, can't you?  <answer28486> You can also use The Wayback Machine. I've used it on numerous occasion to download something that doesn't exist anymore.  <comment27472> When I attempt to do so, I repeatedly get a network time out message:  Network Access Message: The page cannot be displayed  Explanation: The request timed out before the page could be retrieved. <comment27974> I just did a Google search for the exact file name MacUpdate links to. There you go: http://www.google.de/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=bio902_shareware.sit <comment32839> Worked !
