Crashing 2008 iMac with mouse actions <body> My 2008 iMac crashes at random intervals of time, but usually at least every hour of use (sometimes as short as 10 minutes after hard kill and restart).  Screen sometimes freezes, at other time it has alternating vertical stripes, at other times the screen goes black.  When screen visible the mouse freezes.  I have to do a hard restart to recover.  Crashes seem to be associated with a mouse action, most probably with a soft scroll operation or a drag.  This has happened with Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan (I haven't upgraded to Sierra).  I have installed a 1TB HD (partitioned at 700GB for system disk, and two other 150GB partitions for other OS in future) and have 4GB RAM.  This happened as well when I had a 320 GB hard drive and 2GB RAM. To me it seems like a buffer is overflowing somewhere and impacting some code associate with display and user interface.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this problem?  <comment317598> Some questions for you: 1. How long has this been happening for? 2. Is this the 20" or 24" model? 3. When yow went from 2GB RAM to 4GB RAM did you replace the existing RAM with a new 4GB module or just add an additional 2GB module?
