Backup Mac and IOS devices locally <body> I have a friend who lives where there isn't very fast Internet connectivity. He has a Mac Book, an iPad, and some iPhones. He has a decent WiFi hotspot. He wants to back up everything, possibly to a disk drive also connected to his home router - either WiFi or wired. He would also like to be able to restore things, should the need arise. Any suggestions?  <answer137033> Connect the device to iTunes (over Wi-Fi or USB), then select to backup the device. This will backup the contents of the device to ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ which can be copied to an external drive. To restore from backup, copy the folder back and restore from this backup.  <answer137042> With so many devices to back up you should consider the   AirPort Time Capsule.  With AirPort Time Capsule, you get a superfast Wi‑Fi base station and an easy-to-use backup device all in one.   And backing up your data couldn’t be simpler. Just set it up once and AirPort Time Capsule does the rest.  ul liThe iPhone and iPad back up to iTunes on your Mac. /li liThen, when your Mac backs up to the Time Capsule, the iOS backups are copied over as well./li liThe iPhone and iPad cannot backup directly to the Time Capsule. /li /ul  See this Apple Support document for more details on backups.  <comment162739> OP wants to back up locally, so iCloud is not an option <comment162740> @GeorgeGarside thank you for noticing.
