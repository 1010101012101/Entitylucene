Viewing the Apple ID in iTunes' app list? <body> I'm using Windows 7 and I'd like to be able to group my apps by Apple ID, but there is no option from the list view:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ET45C.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I browse to the directory using Windows Explorer I also cannot see the Apple ID listed.  Is there anyway to quickly see which Apple ID each app belongs to?

On OSX I would recommend to write a shell script to automate that, maybe PowerShell will help in an Windows environment. But this is off-topic for AD.
