Prevent ejected Hard Drive from spinning up after sleep mode <body> I tried a lot and still found no answer, which is why I signed up here. So here's the problem:  I got an 2010 iMac with upgraded SSD, HDD still installed for storage reasons, 2 external HD (TimeMachine, Storage). For the sake of speed (avoid the system waiting for HD-spinup when opening finder) and power consumption, I used /etc/fstab to prevent them from being auto-mounted (wrote scripts for automatic mount-backup-unmount procedure).   However, when I wake up the mac from sleep, the system prevents me logging in until the drives have spun up. Which is a seriously long time (around 10-15s), compared to a 2010 MacBook with SSD, that wakes up almost instantly. (same happens on boot-up, but that does not annoy me that much)  Does anyone have an idea what to do? There must be a way to tell the system not to look for any other drive on start up. Or to temporarily cut the power supply with a script or something like that.  Please help!  Edit: I know, there has been a similar thread about this, but the answer does not help: My standby mode is "sleep" (0) as suggested and as far as I understand, Power Manager and SleepWatcher are just capable of strongadding/strong daemons triggered by wake-up, for example. I need to strongdelete/strong or strongprevent/strong a daemon-action from even happening, which should go deeper into the system, than those applications do. I assume, the goal would be to edit a system daemon, not to create one. Or something like that.  Because the author of the other thread did not react for years, I assume his problem has been solved, which makes mine a different one.
