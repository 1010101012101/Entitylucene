osascript bug: AppleScript's initial "choose from list" dialog is unselected <body> I run the following code in Terminal:  precodeosascript "/Users/Me/Desktop/Run this script on wake.scpt" /code/pre  If the first dialog of my .scpt file is a codechoose from list/code dialog, then this dialog will be unselected. That is, I cannot simply hit the kbdenter/kbd key to press "OK"; I must first click anywhere on the dialog to make the top bar of the dialog change from white to grey, and only then can I hit kbdenter/kbd to proceed.  To be clear, the dialog comes to the front just fine - it is simply not selected.  However, if the first dialog is a codedisplay dialog/code or codedisplay alert/code dialog, then the dialog emis/em automatically selected. It just so happens that the initial dialog of my .scpt file is a codechoose from list/code dialog.  I tried writing codeactivate me/code on the line above the codechoose from list/code dialog, but this did not do anything.  When I run the "Run this script on wake.scpt" from within Script Editor, the codechoose from list/code dialog is in fact selected. Hence, we know that the issue is related to codeosascript/code.  Does anyone have a workaround to force the codechoose from list/code dialog to be automatically selected?  I've tried implementing a default selection by inserting the codedefault items/code parameter in the codechoose from list/code command (even though I don't actually want a default item to exist in this case). I thought that doing this might force the dialog to be selected. But, still, the list dialog is unselected.  As a last resort, I suppose that I could use AppleScript to mouse-click the center of the screen (where the dialog is located). But, I'd prefer a more elegant solution, as AppleScript can be unreliable when it comes to mouse clicks.  hr  If you are wondering why I am employing codeosascript/code in the first place, it is because I am using SleepWatcher to automatically run an AppleScript when my computer wakes from sleep. (Here is a very helpful guide that I used to set up SleepWatcher.)  This is the full text of my .wakeup file:  precode#!/bin/bash osascript "/Users/Me/Desktop/Run this script on wake.scpt" /code/pre  <answer275593> This is weird..  For now, I'd recommend that you save your script as an executable. This can be done by opening your Applescript in the Script Editor, then clicking the File menu, then Export, then choosing "Application" in the File Format dropdown box.  You could then create an Applescript that executes this application.  <comment346772> Unfortunately, this solution does not solve the issue. I saved my AppleScript as an .app file via Automator. I then tried launching the .app via Terminal using the [two different methods explained here](https://www.macissues.com/2015/02/06/how-to-launch-os-x-apps-via-the-terminal/). I also tried simply double-clicking the app & launching it from Finder the standard way. I also tried launching the app with AppleScript in a separate .scpt file, as you suggested. In all of these cases, the initial `choose from list` dialog is unselected. But, now we know that the bug is broader than `osascript`. <comment346780> Please disregard my previous comment. I have found that, as long as I include `activate me` on the line above `choose from list`, then when running the .app version of the AppleScript file, the initial list dialog is necessarily selected, no matter how the .app file is run. Thanks! <comment346821> No problem! Glad that using .app worked!
