Microphone has about one minute dictation limit on iPad Air 2 <body> My iPad microphone cuts out after about one minute of dictation. I've tried using Google and Word but the same limitations apply. Does anybody have a solution?  <answer188521> I just tried it on my iPhone and I didn't get the dictation longer than one minute to work either. I don't know if it's a bug or a "feature", but I would assume it is limited by iOS.
