Change libtool used in command line <body> I followed this post to install automake, autoconf and libtool.  When I check automake and autoconf versions they look fine. However, when I check libtool's version I get the following  precode$ libtool --version error: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/libtool: unknown option character `-' in: --version /code/pre  however if I run libtool from install folder I get  precode$ /usr/local/libtool/bin/libtool --version libtool (GNU libtool) 2.4.2 Written by Gordon Matzigkeit &lt;gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu&gt;, 1996 /code/pre  So I think there is a version of libtool already installed with OS X. Is there a way to change it so that when I execute libtool it calls the one on code/usr/local/libtool/bin/code?  <answer239834> Unless your $PATH is different than normal, you could solve that with a sym link of the tool you want.  precode$echo $PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  Then if the libtool you want to run first is code/usr/local/libtool/bin/libtool/code then a quick  precodesudo ln -s /usr/local/libtool/bin/libtool /usr/local/bin /code/pre  At that point, you might have to restart your shell or rehash or codehash -r/code in bash to get the codelibtool/code from code/usr/local/bin/code to be preferred.
