AppleScript Save As Dialog in Safari Reader Save As PDF <body> I have an AppleScript to open move a Safari webpage into Reader view and then to Save As a PDF.  I would like it to Save As the PDF with default filename, but always in the same specific location. I'm not sure how to do this.  Currently the AppleScript runs as:  precodetell application "System Events" tell application process "Safari"     set frontmost to true      repeat until window 1 exists     end repeat      # Render page in Safari Reader     keystroke "r" using {command down, shift down}      delay 0.02      -- Print; wait until the sheet is visible        click menu item "Print…" of menu 1 of menu bar item "File" of menu bar 1      repeat until sheet 1 of window 1 exists     end repeat      set thePopUp to first pop up button of sheet 1 of window 1 whose description is "Presets"     click thePopUp     click menu item "Default Settings" of menu 1 of thePopUp --replace if desired with your preferred preset      click menu button "PDF" of sheet 1 of window 1     click menu item "Save as PDF…" of menu 1 of menu button "PDF" of sheet 1 of window 1 -- Save as PDF...     tell application "Finder"         set filesavepath to "/Users/Ariel/Google Drive/To print"     end tell end tell /code/pre  The final bits of the AppleScript, from 'tell application finder' do not actually make the Page save in my desired location. Please could you help me to this. Thank you for any help.  <answer224560> Here's how you'd do this:  ol liGo into the finder, and drag whichever folder you want to use for this into the "Favorites" section in the sidebar (enable the sidebar in the view menu if it isn't showing)./li liRun this script, but replace codemenu item "Xcode"/code of codeclick menu item "Xcode" of menu 1 of pop up button "Where:"/code with the name of the folder you added to your favorites.  precodetell application "System Events"     tell application process "Safari"         set frontmost to true         tell menu bar 1             click menu item "Show Reader" of menu "View" of menu bar item "View"             click menu item "Save As…" of menu "File" of menu bar item "File"         end tell         tell window 1             repeat until sheet 1 exists             end repeat             tell sheet 1                 click pop up button "Where:"                 repeat until menu 1 of pop up button "Where:" exists                 end repeat                 click menu item "Xcode" of menu 1 of pop up button "Where:"                 click button "Save"             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre/li /ol
