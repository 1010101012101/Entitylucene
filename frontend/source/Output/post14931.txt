Can I install apps on iPhone/iPad from iTunes without syncing? <body> Simple question: Can I install an application that was downloaded to my iTunes into my iPad/iPhone without syncing it with the computer?  I am abroad and without access to wi-fi, only network cable, so the trivial solutions of "download directly through the iPad" and "sync it with your computer once and be over it" won't work (unless I start syncing with two computers at the same time, and I recall it gave me trouble in the past).  <answer14934> No.   To install apps into your iPad you would need to:  ol liInstall it via the App Store (on your iDevice)/li liSync it through iTunes/li /ol  That is, if you don't jailbreak. However, I will not touch on the subject as it may break Apple's license for apps (and void your warranty).  <answer14941> You might be able to download the application (some applications have their own website so you dont have to use iTunes to download them) then drag it into your iPad.  <answer14944> You can try the install with iPhone Configuration Utility:  http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/FA_iPhone_Configuration_Utility/Introduction/Introduction.html  http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution.pdf  <comment16090> u actually might even be able to do this with itunes. It would technically "sync" but it would add or subtract any music, etc. <comment16098> enterprise apps can be installed directly from a the manufactors homepage, without going through appstore nor itunes. <comment16100> whoops, will add that in <comment16227> possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6846/install-iphone-app-without-itunes-interaction/7572#7572 <comment16228> check the duplicate candidate. there are a number of ways to install apps and including @neoneye's suggestion you're still missing at least 2. <comment16251> Hmm, seems like a near-exact duplicate. I will add in the other options when I manage to get my MacBook back (can't type that well on the iPhone) <comment17685> The utility can be downloaded from: http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/ <comment71244> This is not correct and is not likely to become so. You cannot simply "drag" apps onto an iOS device - you have to use iTunes or the iOS App Store.
