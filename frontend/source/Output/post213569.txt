Change GraphicConverter 9 Concat output resolution? <body> I am using GraphicConverter 9 to combine multiple images together, and I'm using the Concat function. The issue I'm having is that the outputted image has a resolution of only 10 ppi...which doesn't make sense since all my images have a 72 ppi resolution.  I'm wondering if anyone knows how to change the output settings or what settings/things I can do to change it so that the output resolution is able to be chosen or changed (if even possible)?  Thanks in advance for any help and suggestions!
