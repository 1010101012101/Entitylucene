Screen capture / record iPhone / iPad <body> strongShort Question :/strong   Is there a mobile app or some desktop software i can use whilst my iphone / ipad is connected to my Macbook Pro that will allow me to record a screen cast / video of the screen ?  strongLong Question :/strong   I dont quite allot of mobile site development and testing. When presenting bugs etc to my team i like to show them a video of whats happening.  For desktop issues i just open the browser and the use screen capture in Quicktime. Where ever possible i do the same for iOS issues using the mobile emulator in Chrome, but because its only an emulator it isnt 100% accurate so not all issues show up.   Some issues i have to use the real device at the moment i capture video for this by using 1 iphone to film on and another to show the issue, but this is not particularly slick.  ( i know i can run a desktop iphone / ipad emulator through xcode, but this only has Safari on there, not Google Chrome as some issues are browser specific)  Is there a mobile app or some desktop software i can use whilst my iphone / ipad is connected to my Macbook Pro that will allow me to record a screen cast / video of the screen ?  <answer233995> Try downloading strongreflector/strong, it will mirror your screen, allowing you to use a screen recorder on your Mac to record it.  <comment286039> Apple Mirroring and AirPlay API has been changed, so you won't be able to use Reflector with iOS 9 anymore
