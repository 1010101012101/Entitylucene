How can I force the predictive keyboard to always spell words with diacritics correctly? <body> Having been using my iPhone 5 since late 2015, it has only been recently (past week) that the predictive keyboard has learned that I will spell caf√© with the appropriate diacritic. I do not wish to manually have to use a diacritic requiring word repeatedly until the algorithm learns the correct spelling (I am incredibly pedantic about diacritics and have absolutely no plans to change my preference anytime soon). Is there a means of forcing the predictive keyboard to always spell with proper diacritics, or is this beyond current implementation due to everyone else being lazybones and never spelling with diacritics?  <comment350811> Can you just the text shortcut feature to automatically correct those words?
