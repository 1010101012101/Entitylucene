No "csrutil" available on recovery HD? <body> Note: I have a mid-2012 Macbook Pro 13.3" model, non-retina (A1278). I replaced included system hard disk with a SSD and recently nuked the disk and installed the latest build image of macOS 10.12.5 Sierra via USB flash and the createinstallmedia program. The disk is fully encrypted with Filevault.  hr  I need to disable System Integrity Protection (well, part of it) temporarily. I reboot into Recovery mode (COMMAND + R at boot) and open the Terminal from the Utilities menu. Within the shell I try to execute the 'csrutil' program but it does not exist at its normal path in /usr/bin; I executed a 'find' on the filesystem to locate it to no avail. I then backed out and went into the Disk Utility to mount the encrypted Filevault System disk, returned to the shell, and found it mounted at /Volumes/System. I thought I could execute programs located on this volume but, alas, I cannot. If I recall correctly I also tried copying a program from the recovery disk filesystem in memory to the disk and executing it and it failed as well; I don't see any noexec flags set on the disk mount, so I am not sure why it's not executing anything on the disk. I'm not sure if I tried to copy /Volumes/System/usr/bin/csrutil to the ramdisk of the Recovery system, as I believe it's read only but I could be wrong.  The recovery partition seems to be the correct size as seen in various tutorials on using it:  precodebrendan@apollo[ttys007]:~/$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage System                  119.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  I mention all that above so that you may know I tried everything I could think of. Do I not have the correct Recovery image on my disk? Did the latest macOS 10.12 not come with all the utilities on its image? What am I missing here? How do I get a copy of csrutil that I can execute on the system? Should I boot from my install media (a USB 3.0 flash "thumb" drive) and use the (presumed available/installed) recovery image there? Or is there something I'm over-looking?  Also: Before anyone mentions it, please know that I looked into "Recovery Partition Creator" v4.0.4 to re-construct the recovery partition, but from what I've read I would have to disable Filevault encryption on my system disk so that it can install the partition. Is this the case, or will it work with my Filevault v2 enabled system? Also, I do have a recovery disk installed after all and haven't tinkered with it since I installed macOS 10.12.5 from scratch.
