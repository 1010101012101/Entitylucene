Which MacBook supports Thunderbolt 3 and has regular USB 3 ports? <body> I'm looking to upgrade my MacBook Air to something with the new Thunderbolt 3 ports, but also has USB 3 ports. There seem to be so many models out there, but I didn't find one.   Which MacBooks have Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3 ports without the need of an extra adapter?  <answer287556>    Which MacBook supports Thunderbolt 3 and has regular USB 3 ports??   strongNone./strong  Currently, the only "MacBook" that supports Thunderbolt 3 are the MacBook Pros that were released in 2016 and on.  Those only have USB-C type Thunderbolt ports.  If you are looking for something that will give you USB-A ports along with USB 3.0 compatibility, you will need a (dreaded) dongle.    The 2016 MacBook Pro 15" (with and without Touchbar) has the following ports:     strongCharging and Expansion/strong Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports with support for:      ul   liCharging/li   liDisplayPort/li   liThunderbolt (up to 40 Gbps)/li   liUSB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps)/li   /ul   The 13" model has only 2 Thunderbolt ports:     strongCharging and Expansion/strong Two Thunderbolt 3  (USB-C) ports with support for:      ul   liCharging/li   liDisplayPort/li   liThunderbolt (up to 40 Gbps)/li   liUSB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps)/li   /ul   The MacBook Air (2015) only supports Thunderbolt 2 while the latest MacBook only support USB-C with DisplayPort (no Thunderbolt).  <comment363076> mac is really pushing my limits. <comment363077> And the worst part is Microsoft includes USB-A but no USB-C or Thunderbolt.  Don't get me started on Dell.  Their website alone sends me off a cliff. <comment363079> @Allan Don't forget to bring a parachute! <comment363080> thinkpad it is.
