How can I move reminders from one list to another by Applescript? <body> I have an use case where I want to move certain reminders I created using Siri from the default list to another. Programmatically, via an AppleScript script, which runs on a Mac.  precodetell application "Reminders"     set output to ""     set inBoxList to "Erinnerungen"     set newList to "Ausgaben"     show list newList -- this works     if (count of (reminders in list inBoxList whose completed is false)) &gt; 0 then         set todoList to reminders in list inBoxList whose completed is false         repeat with itemNum from 1 to (count of (reminders in list inBoxList whose completed is false))             set reminderObj to item itemNum of todoList             set nameObj to name of reminderObj             set idText to id of reminderObj             if (nameObj contains "€" or nameObj contains " Euro ") then                 set output to output &amp; "• " &amp; nameObj                 set completed of reminderObj to "no"                 set container of reminderObj to list "Ausgaben" -- this doesn't             end if         end repeat     end if     return output end tell /code/pre  It's the following line that doesn't work:  precodeset container of reminderObj to list "Ausgaben" -- this doesn't /code/pre  I've tried variations like   precodeset newList to list "Ausgaben" set container of reminderObj to newList /code/pre  but I always get an error that boils down that I can't set the container because it's not f the correct type list.  <answer190140> You can't change the strongcontainer/strong, because this property is read only -- codecontainer (list, r/o)/code : strongr/o/strong means read only  But you can use the strongmove/strong command  precodetell application "Reminders"     set output to ""     set newList to list "Ausgaben"     show newList     repeat with thisReminder in (get reminders in list "Erinnerungen" whose completed is false)         set nameObj to name of thisReminder         if (nameObj contains "€" or nameObj contains " Euro ") then             set output to output &amp; "• " &amp; nameObj             move thisReminder to newList         end if     end repeat     return output end tell /code/pre  <comment225722> Wow. Now I feel stupid. In my defense, “move” isn't listed in the Reminders Suite, but I should have gotten r/o even w/out a legend - which the library seems to lack. Anyway, many thanks, it now works exactly as intended.
