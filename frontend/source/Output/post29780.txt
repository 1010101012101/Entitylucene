iTunes - access to music and apps per country <body> Does access to iTunes from a particular country, mean that iPhone apps are also accessable in that country?  <answer29782> Yes. Access to the iTunes music store using one Apple-ID means that you can also use its apps section. The ID is connected to a credit card, and the ID gives access to the store in the country to which that credit card belongs. Gift cards have been a trick in the past to work around that.  <comment34215> Could you elaborate a bit about what you are trying to do and what you've tried to solve your problem? For a question to be useful to others it needs to define a problem in specific terms. Could you edit or comment so we can make this into something usable by others? <comment34310> Great.  Thank you hara.
