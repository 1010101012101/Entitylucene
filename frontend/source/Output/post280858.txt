Can no longer send SMS texts from macOS <body> I'm not sure what happened, but I'm no longer able to send SMS texts from my desktop (Sierra). I thought it was because I moved all my contacts to Google instead of iCloud, but even numbers that aren't stored anywhere yet I'm unable to reach. And even if I make a new contact on my Mac only, I can't text it.  Everything appears to be set up correctly. Handoff is on, my iPhone is set to accept text forwarding from my Mac Pro. I'm not sure what else to try.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qH1An.png" alt="enter image description here"
