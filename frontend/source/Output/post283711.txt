Insert dots at the end of a phrase <body> I need some help with a table of contents. I'm trying to automatically add dots (take a look at red rectangles) at the end of a phrase with the number of the page, as shown in this example image I have found in the internet:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcsC4.png" alt=""  <answer283718> To add the dots to your table of contents, select the table, choose the Text inspector, then select the leader as dots.                                                    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6zTLj.png" width="262"  If you don't have a table of contents, place the cursor where you wish to insert the table of contents, then Insert → Table of Contents and choose the scope.         img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lA7W8.jpg" width="584"  <answer283733> I just found what I was looking for:  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH23640?locale=en_US Thank you all.  <comment357727> What's the issue you're encountering? <comment357761> Thank you for helping me, but the dots don't appear :/ <comment357762> @TiS See edit, that should work if they don't appear for you <comment357763> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. Also the solution given in the link is the same solution given in my answer. <comment357824> Sorry, I'm new around.
