Quick Look keeps popping up <body> I use the kbdspacebar/kbd to preview some files with Quick Look and when I'm done with it I close the preview window.  Sometimes when I change desktops the preview window will pop up again (empty) and when I try to close it, it will put me back on the desktop where I previewed an item.  This keeps occurring and I have no way of getting rid of it... Any solutions?br I'm using a OS X 10.9.3   <answer143713> It's irritating, for sure - best workaround I've found is to relaunch the Finder...    Option Right-click the Finder icon in the Dock &amp; you see an extra item at the bottom of the menu - Relaunch  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KgWZL.png" alt="enter image description here"
