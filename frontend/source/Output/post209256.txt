How to install ruby gems without sudo <body> I want to install a Ruby Gem to my computer, but since I don't have an administrator account I can't use codesudo/code. How do I install a Gem without codesudo/code, and what (if any) privileges do I loose? This is in reference to this question I asked on Stack Overflow.   h2Update:/h2  I installed RVM, but I got these two errors:  precodeWARNING: your RVM loading script `/etc/profile.d/rvm.sh` is deprecated and causes you to have `umask g+w` set in your shell, run `rvm get head --auto-dotfiles` again to fix your scripts. /code/pre  And  precodeWARNING: You have '~/.profile' file, you might want to load it, to do that add the following line to '/Users/CalebKleveter/.bash_profile':    source ~/.profile /code/pre  I ran codervm get head --auto-dotfiles/code, but I got the same errors again. Any suggestions on what to do? And what does the second error message want me to do?  h2Update 2:/h2  I tried gem install cocoapods and I got the error in my other post, then I tried rvm gem install cocoapods and I got "Please note that rvm gem ... was removed, try gem install cocoapods or rvm all do gem install cocoapods instead. ( see: 'rvm usage' )" so I tried rvm all do gem install cocoapods and it just started a new command prompt, that is what is supposed to happen, right?  <answer209319> RVM:  From the rvm.io homepage, I used: code\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable/code . This worked fine for me, not admin permissions needed.   <comment252408> I actually use `rvm`. It installs ruby into your home folder, so you don't need `sudo`. It works fine for me. Try that, and if it works I'll post it as an answer. <comment252417> @IronCraftMan, if you look at the link you will notice I tried to install RVM, but it didn't work. "The other solution of installing RVM I looked into, but I had trouble installing it. (Maybe because I'm not an admin?)", Can you go over how to install RVM? <comment252524> Sorry about my delay. I added an update to my post. <comment252531> By "some errors again" do you meant the same ones as before? <comment252538> @IronCraftMan, Yes. <comment252539> can you run `gem install (yourgem) ` <comment252543> @IronCraftMan, I tried `gem install cocoapods` and I got the error in my other post, then I tried `rvm gem install cocoapods` and I got "Please note that `rvm gem ...` was removed, try `gem install cocoapods` or `rvm all do gem install cocoapods` instead.
