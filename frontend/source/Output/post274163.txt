Restore files from Time Machine to a different Mac <body> My old MacBook Pro died recently (dead logic board) and I am unable to access the files on the hard drive.  I used Time Machine to back it up and it was running macOS El Capitan.  My new MacBook Pro is running Sierra.  I want to restore some of the files from my old Macs Time Machine to my new Mac.  When I go into Time Machine I choose "Browse Other Backup Disks" and Time Machine opens.  However I cannot go "back in time" (using the arrows or the slider on the right hand side), it seem as though Time Machine is empty.  <answer274169> Open "Migration Assistant" on the new Mac. Select the restore from Time Machine backup option. Select the time machine back up you want to restore from and restore.  <comment344601> Are you following all the steps Apple has outlined for [restoring from TM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250)? <comment344604> Not exactly because I am restoring from a different Mac, which is why I chose "Browse Other Backup Disks".  The problem is that there is nothing in there. <comment344608> That support article states: "To copy the files, settings, and user accounts in your backup to another Mac, use Migration Assistant." and has a link to the MA support page. <comment344611> Ok I tried the migration assistant.  I can connect to the drive OK but it just says "Loading disks..." and I can't progress any further. <comment344665> The downside of trying to migrate **after** setting up the new machine, as opposed to as part of the initial setup, is you will end up with two accounts, the old & the new. Your best bet, if the new machine is still clean enough to not worry, is to wipe it & start over, then migrate as part of the first set up. <comment344770> Is that the only way?  I only want to select certain things to restore, not the entire machine. <comment344786> Migration assistant has some options as to what data [though idk specifics as I've only ever used it for full migrations] <comment345268> Had to restore the entire TM backup, which has worked successfully.
