mouse direction setting on headless (mouse less) mac <body> I have a mini that's running headless and mouseless.  I connect to it through TeamViewer.  All is great - except... The mouse direction defaults to Natural and I'm old school.  Since the machine has no physical mouse attached there's no mouse settings panel to change the direction on.    So - anyone have a guess of how to change the setting?  Thanks,  Steve   <answer282202> You can do it from Terminal using   precodedefaults write -g com.apple.swipescrolldirection -bool FALSE /code/pre  codeTRUE/code to reverse that call &amp; set back to 'natural'  You can test the current value using   precodedefaults read -g com.apple.swipescrolldirection /code/pre  credit goes to Topher Kessler
