How to handle user-to-user donations? <body> I am building an app that will require an implementation of users paying other users. I'm confused with exactly how to handle payments of this type that will conform to the App Store guidelines.   h3Nature of Payments/h3  These payments will not be used to empurchase/em any physical or virtual good. After a user makes a payment, they will not receive anything. However, if enough money is raised, a virtual good will be unlocked to strongeveryone/strong; not just the people that paid. BUT, this virtual good will also be unlocked eventually without emany/em payment, making the payment itself not necessary and completely optional. Because of this, we are calling the payments emdonations/em.   h3Gray Area/h3  Apple's guidelines state that all donations must be handled on a web page outside of the app itself. They also state that any purchase of a virtual good must use IAP. It seems as though this might be an argument of semantics, and I want to make sure I implement the correct payment method since they are both very different.   What is the right method for handling this?  <comment272560> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because only Apple knows how to apply the guidelines here. <comment272609> @patrix Is there a way to actually ask Apple this? If only Apple knows, then I should be able to ask a reviewer this question beforehand. Leaving it up to chance hardly seems like the right way to do it.
