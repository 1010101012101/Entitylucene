MS Word for Mac, show outline on the left panel <body> In MS Word for Windows, I can see an outline panel that shows headings so that I can jump to desired section quickly. But I don't have such an outline panel in Word for Mac.  It does not have 'view' tab in the ribbon.  I'm NOT talking about 'outline view' that you can choose on the lower-left corner of the window. I want an outline displayed on the left-hand side and main text in the middle.  <answer132468> I think I found the answer.  There is 'Show or hide the Sidebar' button on the toolbar.  I can choose 'Reviewing pane' from that button.
