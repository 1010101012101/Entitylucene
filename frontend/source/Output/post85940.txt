cannot get my google contacts to show even after setting up the exchange account microsoft exchange <body> I have all my contacts in Google Contacts, so I was wondering is there anyway I could sync them with the contacts on the phone? I have spent hours trawling through stuff online today, and can see a couple of odd things on my iphone that may help you to help me. in settings, under contacts i have no default account, but if i connect "contacts" to icloud, it gives me either icloud or my iphone as a default. My ipad shows gmail contacts as my default account. Can i do anything to get a default account without connecting to icloud, as i just want to sync with gmail contacts  <comment113582> I'm having this exact same problem whether I use Exchange or regular Gmail syncing...
