iPhone calendar error edit?usp=drive_web when opening attachment <body> When I attempt to open a file attached to an appointment in Calendar on my iPhone it has replaced the file name with and error, "edit?usp=drive_web" and the application crashes when the attachment is clicked. Any ideas?  <answer90321> If this is a shared calendar, this means that either the attachment has since been removed or that you do not have sufficient privileges to access it on your iPhone.  <comment106513> it is shared, but I have checked both of those features with the owner of the material and the attachment still won't appear :(
