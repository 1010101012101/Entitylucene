Is BetterTouchTool the recommended app to improve gestures? <body> I was looking for a way to add more "gestures" for my mbp (to accesss spaces for example) and I read about BetterTouchTool which seems to work quite well.  I was just wondering if there's any other tool like that one, and if another is more recommended.  <answer12380> I personally use it, and believe me it's awesome. I'll give it 4.5/5  <answer30900> Actually there is another application out there called JiTouch. It is much better than BetterTouchTool (except for the window snapping, which it doesn't have). I would recommend JiTouch over BetterTouchTool, even though JiTouch is a $6 paid application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNUNm.png" alt="JiTouch Features"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHYVy.png" alt="JiTouch Pref pane"  <answer130855> called JiTouch.
