Is it a bad practice to mount network/slow shares under `/Volumes`? <body> I'm using curlftpfs with macfuse to mount some ftp sites through codeautomount/code. The mount directories for each share is in code/Volumes/code folder. Now iTunes on each startup tries to read code/Volumes/Curlftpfs_Share/code and hangs.  Is it a bad practice to mount network/slow shares under code/Volumes/code, where should I mount it instead?  Why does iTunes check all mounted shares on startup â€” can I switch it off?  <comment83407> I don't think it matters where you mount them as far as bad/good practise goes. I often see Linux setups with mounts mainly in `/mnt`. I guess iTunes takes the liberty of scanning it because it assumes it's a locally attached volume. Just create a directory somewhere that suits you and mount it there. Or, if this is hanging for when it's not connected, adjust the timeout in your `automount` configs. <comment83657> I agree with *CraftyThumber*, I think it's perfectly OK (and even best practice on Macs) to mount network drives under `/Volumes`. Think that OS X also mounts them there. I don't have a silver bullet to solve the problem you describe... I've read that starting iTunes while holding down the Option/Alt key and explicitly selecting the path to your library may help.
