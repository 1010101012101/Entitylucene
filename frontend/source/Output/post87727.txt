OS X breaks if I apply HFS compression to the whole volume. What do I need to exclude? <body> OS X breaks if I apply HFS compression to the whole volume.  (It won't boot.)  What do I need to exclude?  I've been able to compress large parts of it, but then I had to restore after I compressed too much.  I guess I can try to answer this via trial and error.  (Space is extremely tight on my boot volume.)  I'm guessing that these need to (or should) remain uncompressed:   precode/mach_kernel /sbin /dev  /bin /.??* /private /code/pre  /private includes  precode /etc /tmp /var  /code/pre  I would guess I can get away with compressing most if not all of   precode/var/folders /System /Applications /Library /Users /usr /code/pre  (Educated guess; include the stuff needed to bootstrap the system.)  At some point I may try to figure this out via trial and error, and answer my own question, but why reinvent the wheel when there's StackExchange?  <comment102604> /var ought to be able to be compressed (it plays a vital role e.g. for Open Directory, but this happens relatively long after the root partition is mounted), while /S/L/CoreServices/boot.efi has to be accessible by the firmware. <comment102607> Thanks.  I'm not familiar with /usr/standalone, which includes /usr/standalone/i386/boot.efi but I would guess it shouldn't be compressed either.
