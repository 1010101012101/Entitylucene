iphone wont send imessage to another iphone - sends as sms <body> My dad has an iPhone 4. He has his iMessage and group messaging turned on, but when I use iMessage to message him and my mom (who also has an iPhone, as do I), the messages that I send only go through to my mom (i.e. I send a group message to my mom and dad and only my mom gets it). When my mom responds, both my dad and I get the message, so that works normally. I can message my dad directly (not in a group text), but that sends as an SMS (it shows up green vs. blue), even though I have his number stored as an iPhone in my contacts. How can I get it so that I can iMessage him vs send him an SMS? I think once that part of it is fixed I might be able to send him group texts with success.  <comment314457> Does he have iMessags turned on?  Did he accidentally leave the the group conversation so that he's not getting those messages? <comment314462> I don't remember exactly where the pref was in iOS 7, but SettingsiMessage  make sure his iCloud email address is one of the possible receivers, not just the phone number. Might also be worth trying it for a sender too. Experiment ;) <comment314530> I tried this sort of stuff. Sorry - I should've mentioned that I tried the basic sort of things like making sure his iMessage and group messaging was turned on.
