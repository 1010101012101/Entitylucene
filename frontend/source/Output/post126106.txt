How can I stop the shell command `mate` from opening Textmate 1.x instead of Textmate2? <body> I've installed codemate/code in the preferences pane in TextMate2. It says "Shell support installed." I added the string codeexport EDITOR="/usr/local/bin/mate -w"/code to code~/.bashrc/code as instructed.  However, when I use the codemate/code command, Textmate 1 launches, for example if I type codemate test.txt/code in the Terminal. I would like it to launch TextMate2.  Ideally, I'd like to keep TM1 around, as it does a few things that TM2 doesn't yet do. But if scrapping TM1 is the only/best option, that'd be useful to know, too.   <answer126135> You need to replace the symlink path in /usr/local/bin/mate to Textmate2  precode//go to the bin directory cd /usr/local/bin  //delete the existing symlink rm -rf mate  //create the symlink to the Textmate 2 mate executable ln -s /Applications/TextMate2.app/Contents/Resources/mate mate /code/pre
