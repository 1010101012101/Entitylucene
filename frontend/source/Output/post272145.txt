Login password not required after sleep <body> I have an issue where my login password isn't being required after my Mac goes to sleep.  In the strongSystem Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy/strong pane, I have checked the em"Require password ... after sleep or screen saver begins"/em box. Every time I quit System Preferences, the box becomes unticked, and then when my laptop goes to sleep no password is required to login.  I have tried:  ul liReseting the PRAM multiple times /li liI have restored the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist from a time capsule backup from before the issue began/li liI have ran codesudo defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 1/code /li liI have ran codesudo defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -bool true/code/li liI have put my laptop to sleep overnight with the password required option unchecked, and then re-checked it after/li /ul  I have no clue why this is happening. I'm running a 13 inch MBP, MacOS Sierra 10.12.3. If anyone could suggest a fix
