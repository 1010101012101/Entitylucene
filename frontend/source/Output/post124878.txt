A player with global hotkeys in Mavericks for back/forward <body> I want to use Dictatation in order to dictate a text that I listen in a headset. I would like to be able to pause and go back/forward without switching between the windows of the text editor and of the player.  Using global keys for this would be a  way. I already have the button f8 for pausing, but what about back and forward?  Is there a player with such global keys?  <answer124947> You can use Automator to create Services that control the playback of QuickTime Player, then assign keyboard shortcuts to the Services in System Preferences.
