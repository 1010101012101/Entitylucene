GENKI Vocab Cards app doesn't play sound <body> I have just purchased the GENKI Vocab Cards app for reviewing vocabulary from the GENKI Japanese textbook. It is a flashcards application. Every card is equipped with a loudspeaker button that is supposed to sound the pronunciation of the card's word or phrase when clicked. However, clicking the button produces no sound.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KcllHm.png" alt="A card within the GENKI Vocal Cards app"  I have no problem hearing the playback of a Voice Memos recording.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KIbVa.png" alt="enter image description here"  What steps can I take to try and fix this issue?  hr  iOS App: GENKI Vocab Cards, Version 2.2.0  Device: iPhone 7  iOS: 10.3.1 (14E304)  Issue: Pressing the "play/speak" button results in no sound output  <answer280360> strongUntoggle the mute switch/strong at the top left of your iPhone.
