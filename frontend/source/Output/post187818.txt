Would the battery from a 13" MacBook Pro (2010) work in a 15" MacBook Pro 2011? <body> The battery of my MacBook Pro 15" (early 2011) died recently and I happen to have the battery from a 13" MacBook Pro (2010) handy.   Does anyone know of any reasons why this battery would not work?   I'm not concerned about battery life - I just want to be able to power the thing up.   Any ideas?  Thanks!  <answer187828> Nope. They're different sizes. Compare iFixit's guide to replacing a 15" early 2011 battery to their guide for a 2010 13":  15":   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mU2dEm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  13":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L4T6sm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Both batteries are roughly proportional to their cases, and the 15" has a substantially bigger case than the 13". Additionally, they're shaped differently - see the little notch in the top left of the 15" battery, which isn't there on the 13" battery. It physically won't fit.  <comment222465> Thanks, I was aware they were different sizes but thought I'd somehow be able to fit it in, but I tried and nope. Thanks
