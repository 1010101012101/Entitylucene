Change System password <body> When I set up my new macbook pro, I chose to use my apple store username / password. However, the password is a pretty long one, and it's annoying to have to type it in every time I need to change a program, run something as root, etc.  How can I set a simpler "local" password to use without resetting my apple ID?  <answer195266> It depends on how you setup your computer, if you set your computer to use your iCloud password to login then you'll need to unlike this.

Otherwise, it should give you an option to disassociate and use local login instead, and you'll be able to create a new local password.
