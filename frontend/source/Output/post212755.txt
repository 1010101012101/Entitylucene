OS X El Capitan & Android Studio 1.4 <body> Has anyone else noticed the following with Android Studio 1.4 running on OS X El Capitan?  I can't remember the exact point when I lost the ability to build an Android app from the IDE due to the fact that the extensive set of custom pre build steps that I have failed to run. Those custom steps run a Python-script, and the main problem is that gradle doesn't seem to find the Python-binary due to the fact that the PATH environment variable is the extremely sparse list of code/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code.  Here are some random points related to finding this issue:  ul liThis problem does not affect building from the terminal./li liThis problem is specific to OS X, none of my Linux boxes suffer from this, nor my colleague's Windows machine suffer from this./li liThis is specifically about having codePATH/code set properly./li /ul  What I've tried this far:  ul liEditing code/etc/paths/code: nope, no help./li liVarious code~/Library/LaunchAgent/code -tips found from the net. Y'know those codelaunchctl setenv PATH .../code? No help./li /ul  <answer212904> After further work on this, I found something that seems to work. I RTM'ed the man page of codelaunchctl/code, and noticed the config-subcommand. So this is what I did:  precodesudo launchctl config user path "paths:I:want:GUI:apps:to:use" /code/pre  Then reboot, as launchctl instructed me to do.  I had added a debug print statement to my gradle file:  precodeprintln System.getenv("PATH") /code/pre  After rebooting, build printed out the changed codePATH/code including those parts that I added via codeconfig user path/code.  <comment256881> Please don't add a possible answer **in** your question.
