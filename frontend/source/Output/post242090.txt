Mail crashes permanently - can't open it anymore <body> I have a question and need a bit of help. I do have my complete mails on my Mac since 2012. Now today Apple Mail crashes when I opened it. I looked up where the files are and I do have more then 105 GB of mails in the Library. Now - YES - I could delete all folders - which would take away all my infos from the past.  I can't get in and archive or do anything.  Is there any fix to that or do I need to start new ??  <answer242097> First, try rebuilding your Mails' Envelope Index..  To do this:  ol lilog into your user/li limake sure Mail is NOT running./li lipull down "Go", click (near the bottom item) "Go to Folder", and insert this in the window:  ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData//li liLook for:  Envelope Index/li liDelete it (drag to trash).. DO NOT EMPTY TRASH YET.../li lirestart Mail.  It will tell you that it needs to rebuild the account.. this could take seconds, minutes, or hours..... do not interrupt it.../li /ol  This is the fastest/best way to rebuild your Mail account...  <comment297624> Note that El Capitan Mail is now in V3.
