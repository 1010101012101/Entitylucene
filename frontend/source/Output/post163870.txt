VLC in Mac does not show video window <body> I have just installed VLC for Mac, after I added a video file to my play list all I can see is this window + the audio played.  Please let me know how can I show the video playback?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h1MWs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer163872> That's the playlist window.  On strongMac OS X/strong:  Press kbdCMD/kbd + kbdOPTION/kbd + kbdP/kbd to switch modes, or click on codeWindow/code  codePlaylist/code.  On strongWindows/strong:  Press kbdCTRL/kbd + kbdL/kbd to switch modes, or click on codeView/code  codePlaylist/code.  <answer164608> Here's another thing to check: I found that when I doubt-clicked a video to play it, VLC opened, which I could tell from the dock, but I didn't see a window with the video playing in it. I finally figured out that VLC was opening the video window in a new "Space", so after it started I would have to slide over to the next Space. Try that.   <answer164632> I've experienced something similar with VLC. Typically, I play vids in full screen on my second display connected to my MacBook. When I am not connected to the external display and I play a vid, VLC seems to want to still play in this dual display mode. So it's like it's playing on a ghost second display.  If this is your situation, the easiest solution is to strongsimply press 'Escape'./strong That pulls the vid out of full screen mode (on the ghost second monitor) and displays it in windowed mode.  From there you should be good.  (P.S. emI just wrote this same thing in another similar VLC post today... Must be something in the air./em)  <answer198114> Go to the preferences and select "Show video within main window"  <comment191983> how did you get that video? from youtube download? it shows it as QuickTime file? <comment192157> Yes, YouTube download. It is a mp4 file. <comment192158> From View menu I don't see the Playlist. <comment192970> Sorry, updated the answer. <comment193052> I know this is trivial, but make sure to Enable Video in VLC preferences.
