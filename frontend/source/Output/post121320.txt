Is it better to purchase 1password from agilebits website or the app store? <body> Is it better value to purchase 1password from the https://agilebits.com/ website or the app store?  They cost different amounts, does the app store version include all future versions of 1password?  Which is the best option for consumers based on the license terms of the Mac App store versus a third party license where you buy an app directly from the vendor?  (I have checked the agilebits.com website, but cannot find this information)  <answer121440> There are benefits to both sides:  ul liThe Mac App Store's 1Password has iCloud syncing whereas the AgileBits store distribution method can't include iCloud syncing since an app must be distributed through the Mac App Store to use such Apple services./li liThe AgileBits store's 1Password is updated more frequently since the updates don't have to go through Apple's approval system. This also means you can get beta updates that aren't on the Mac App Store due to Apple's guidelines on beta distribution./li /ul  <answer121537> http://learn.agilebits.com/1Password4/Mac/en/KB/where_to_purchase.html     Should I purchase on the Mac App Store or from your website?      To use iCloud syncing you should purchase on the Mac App Store, but   ultimately the choice is a personal preference. Using the Mac App   Store makes it easier since you donâ€™t need to keep track of a license   key. On the other hand, purchasing from our website is also great   since 1Password provides a great way to keep track of software license   keys, and you will receive updates faster as we approve them directly.   <comment141413> See https://agilebits.com/home/licenses <comment141428> This is very much on-topic once it gets an edit to narrow down what "best" means. Anyone can have an opinion so without knowing what best is to pingu - this can have as many answers as people care to form an opinion. <comment141438> See : http://learn.agilebits.com/1Password4/Mac/en/KB/where_to_purchase.html <comment141440> Also a guide of How to migrate from the MAS version to the web store version: http://learn.agilebits.com/1Password4/Mac/en/KB/mas-web.html <comment141475> Standalone version cannot use iCloud for sync. <comment149603> Additionally, the second option gives more of your money to AgileBits vs. Apple.
