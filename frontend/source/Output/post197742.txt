Create a Global Shortcut for a Single Letter <body> The "w" key on my MacBook Pro broke due to water damage. Currently I am copy and pasting the letter whenever I need that, but I would prefer to be able to press a keyboard shortcut to type it.  The shortcut needs to be available no matter the app; I would prefer the shortcut to be control + option (just those two keys) but if that's not possible then I'll settle for something else.  I tried setting a shortcut through the settings app, but I couldn't figure out how to 1) bind a single letter and 2) have the shortcut available globally.  I'm running Yosemite 10.10.3  <answer197748> One relative simple method is to assign a text input that is than covered in to "w" when you type your sequence.  I have choose to type (v) that is covered to "w", but you can choose what suits you best (and you can remember.  Open Keyboard-Text pref in the syst pref.  Click on the + sign to add new.  Now first type your choice, then paste a w in the right coulomb.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ar6v.jpg" alt="v vs w"  It will work on almost all OS X app, but wont work on web pages like this one.  <answer197749> Buscar's answer gives you a good option.  Another way that you can do this is to show the kbdKeyboard Viewer/kbd which you can access from the menu bar. It will show up as a flag if you set it to display that way next to the volume icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2AqAP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then all you need to do is mouse click the kbdW/kbd when you need to use it.  strongUPDATE/strong  A universal keyboard option would be to use a clipboard manager. If you read this article it will tell you more about them. From the article it says that they all have a way of favoriting a particular past and assigning it to a key combination like kbdcommand/kbd + kbd1/kbd, etc.  strongUPDATE 2/strong  bjbk gave me an idea. You could get one of the wireless blue-tooth keyboards that Apple ships with iMacs. Then you just connect via blue-tooth and brand new keyboard, and it slips in the same pocket as a laptop. I have seen many people pair these with iPads.  <answer197797> BetterTouchTool is another great example.  Download BTT from here. Once you have it open go to the keyboard option and enter in your shortcut (I chose kbdopt/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdz/kbd since that should be an uncommon shortcut). After that you then set your 'trigger predefined action' to 'paste custom text' and paste in your 'w'.  Whenever you need to write a 'w' you can now press kbdopt/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdz/kbd.   <comment236436> How do I trigger the conversion? I bound "w" to "*)", but nothing happens. <comment236438> I do not know for the "*)" let me try, otherwise it works right away. It works as well. <comment236439> It seems to only work in built-in mac apps (text-edit, mail, etc.) Not what I'm looking for. <comment236440> That is what I said in my answer. <comment236441> I'd prefer a keyboard solution - I find suddenly switching to the trackpad inconvenient. <comment236443> Sorry, missed that. I did ask for a global solution. <comment236444> Which key on your keyboard are you ready to sacrifice to remap it in to "w" <comment236445> Unfortunately most apps will have their own keybinding settings. They usually avoid the system bindings, or use the same ones, which is why some "global" commands like `cmd` + `C` work as Copy for all apps. This is the one way that will insure global support, but I understand your preference. <comment236446> As mentioned in my post, alt + option . Alternatively, alt + z is convenient. <comment236447> OK, try the karabiner app it might suits you. https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ <comment236448> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/26322/discussion-between-peragon-and-buscarsd). <comment236450> Another albeit clunky option would be to carry around an external keyboard either wired or wireless. Just saying for the sake of mentioning. <comment236452> @bjbk I have one on my desk because I could never find a better option for a numeric keypad. Couldn't you also connect with the blue-tooth keyboard that comes with iMacs? <comment236453> @AMR one sure can no problem. <comment236454> Using an external keyboard is not an option - I very rarely have a good place to put it, and I'd rather not buy a keyboard + bag.
