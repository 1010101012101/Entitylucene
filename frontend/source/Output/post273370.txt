Facebook photo sync <body> I have a query. I want to know about Facebook photo sync feature. Back then when it used to sync photos, did it sync the videos in the gallery aswell. I am an iPhone user so all my photos and videos are in one library. And how to make sure that facebook is no more syncing my private photos?
