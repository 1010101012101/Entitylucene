How can I get my iPhone to consistently apply or ignore auto-corrections based on my response? <body> I have an iPhone 4S (Black, 32 GB, AT&amp;T) running iOS 5.0.1, but I previously saw this issue on my jail-broken iPhone 3GS while it was running 5.0 and 4.3.3. This iPhone 4S is not jail-broken, nor has it been jail-broken in the past.  This occurs only sometimes. While I am typing and an auto-correction pops up, if I click on the auto-correction, it substitutes the text immediately instead of disabling that particular correction.  Is this a bug, or is it possible that I have a setting somewhere that causes it to act in this fashion? Is there a work-around?  <answer43448> Non-jailbroken iOS doesn't give much room for auto-corrections adjustment. Settings  General  Keyboard, is about all there is.  It is possible that it is a bug on your system, but on my 4S (5.1), I duplicated your problem only when I didn't tap the balloon itself.  <comment49344> When you say that you "missed the balloon," do you mean that you clicked entirely outside of it? <comment49345> Yes (and no). Out of it enough that the screen/phone recognizes it as out of the balloon. <comment49347> Clicking outside the balloon doesn't seem to duplicate this for me - at least, not 100% of the time. And clicking inside the balloon seems to sometimes still replace it. <comment49350> What kind of case do you have on it? I also edited the first part out of my answer. <comment49367> Are you referring to the physical case protecting my device? It's an Otterbox Defender (the newer, 4S model rather than the model originally made for the iPhone 4). <comment49375> There is a chance that your screen protector is causing a problem. Make sure that the Defender's screen cover is the ONLY screen cover on your phone. You could always try removing the case, and trying it then. <comment49407> Ah, that is possible. It is the only screen protector I am using. I will try removing the case and see if I can reproduce the issue.
