Not able to write a file with root <body> I am trying to write to a codevim/code file, codefortran.vim/code. I gave myself access to root following these guidelines. I also saw this SO post, but the answers did not help.   precodesh-3.2# ls -l fortran.vim -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  4043 Sep  9  2010 fortran.vim sh-3.2# whoami root /code/pre  root seems to have read/write access to the file, and I am indeed logged in as root. Any idea what the problem is here?  strongUpdate after comments:/strong  ol licode:w!/code doesn't work/li liI am in directory code/usr/share/vim/vim73/ftplugin//code/li liRunning codels -dl/code returns: codedrwxr-xr-x  178 root  wheel  6052 May  1  2014 ./code/li /ol  <answer266278> Files in code/usr/code are protected by SIP, see What is the &quot;rootless&quot; feature in El Capitan, really? for details. codevim/code should be able to read config files from user-writable directories as well, codeman vim/code has the details.   <comment333898> You don't actually need to enable the root user, `sudo -s` from any account with admin privileges gives you a root shell as well. But this is not directly related to your problem. <comment333900> mhm I'm getting to hate any apple product more and more... so much restrictions! Thanks
