How do I make Terminal.app's scrollbars disappear in Lion? <body> Once I upgraded to Lion, I found out that the vertical scrollbar is always plastered to the right side of the application window.   Because I run GNU Screen within Terminal.app, the right side of the codescreen/code session gets hidden partially underneath said scrollbar. Likewise for codeemacs/code sessions.  Is there a way to disable scrollbars in Terminal.app in Lion?  <answer20615> I assume you're not using a trackpad, and/or your strongShow scroll bars/strong preference in System Preferences  General is set to either strongAutomatically based on input device/strong or strongAlways/strong (otherwise, you shouldn't be seeing persistent scrollbars).  Try changing this setting for Terminal only:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal AppleShowScrollBars -string WhenScrolling /code/pre  Then close Terminal and reopen it for the change to take effect.  <answer20828> System Preferences  General  Show scroll bars  When scrolling  <answer70928> Try LionScrollbars. It's the only thing that worked for me (besides setting the entire system to "When scrolling"). Works like a charm under 10.8.2.  <comment22703> I am using a trackpad, but the setting worked perfectly. Cheers! <comment123368> This didn't work for me in OS X 10.8.5, but [LionScrollbars](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/70928/2767) did. <comment259531> Great answer but the property name is case sensitive and the correct case is `AppleShowScrollBars`, making this change made the setting work. <comment259651> m1h4 comment is correct about case. You also have to quit and relaunch terminal for the change to take affect. (Tested under El Capitan)
