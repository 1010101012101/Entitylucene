Does iOS have a firewall? <body> Does iOS support a built-in firewall like macOS does? I don't see anything about it in Settings.  <answer48066> When you have jail broken your iPhone/iPod/iPad you can download a firewall setting in cydia  You can find an article about it here:  http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/02/17/firewall-ip-2-0-released-in-cydia-a-security-center-for-the-iphone/  <answer48109> Page 27 of the September 2015 iOS Security White Paper states that there is not a firewall on iOS.     On other platforms, firewall software is needed to protect open communication ports against intrusion. Because iOS achieves a reduced attack surface by limiting listening ports and removing unnecessary network utilities such as telnet, shells, or a web server, no additional firewall software is needed on iOS devices.   <comment55027> Why? What are you trying to accomplish? <comment55055> Would be nice to have a Firewall enabled when using a public wifi hot spot, etc. <comment55056> Again, why? Apps are sandboxed. Un-needed ports are blocked. What specifically are you trying to accomplish? <comment55059> Just an extra layer of security, having a iOS device saying I am here and I have ports open does not seem wise <comment55063> Welcome to Ask Different, Xcodeuser!! Thanks for posting an answer. Can you please add a little more information, such as a link to the firewall setting tweak? Thanks! <comment55066> I've had folks at DC612 (the local Defcon SIG) try various scanning tools against my iPhone and they haven't come up with anything useful. Not a definitive answer I realize, but it seems to me you're chasing dragons. Best of luck. <comment55895> How did you find out about "All ports are dynamically blocked on iOS to incoming traffic until an app needs specific access"
