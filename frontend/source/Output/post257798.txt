MacBook Pro screen is not turning on <body> First of all, I need to tell you guys I've tried all the basic solutions for this. I've tried doing SMC reset and the PRAM reset. I've plugged out the battery and I did the exact same thing the internet has listed but my macbook just won't turn on.  First, it boots when i plugged my MagSafe adaptor. Then there'a a chime and the Caps Lock key can turn on. But then the display flashes for a millisecond or something. Then it turns black again. I'm trying to find the cheapest away out of this as I'm only a high school student.  <comment322072> Bring your Mac to an Apple Store. It might be a known graphic card problem for which they have a replacement program. ( I had one with a 2011 model. Apple made the replacement for free and for 3 days of no Mac and no work. ) <comment322073> Be careful, even if your screen stays off, your Mac is booted, your disk is running, and brutal power off will damage your file system up to a point of no return. <comment322081> It's not 100% clear whether your Mac is booting up fine but your screen just isn't working, or whether your Mac just isn't booting up properly. Have you tried connecting it to an external display and booting up? Have you tried starting in Safe Mode? What else do you have access to (other Macs etc)? Also, can you clarify your Mac model and the version of macOS you're running? <comment322089> Could be no backlight? Is the Apple logo  on?
