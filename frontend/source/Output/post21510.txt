My airport never stops searching for networks, even when I'm already connected <body> I switched to Lion soon after it came out on my MacBook Pro.  Now when I pull down the airport menu, it indicates that it is searching for networks all the time.  It does this even after I am connected to my preferred network.  I never noticed this with Leopard nor Snow Leopard.  Is this a bug?  a feature?  Should I care?  <answer21513> It's the refrigerator light problem.  It's searching because you pulled down the Airport menu.  <comment23628> Winning question and answer! Brilliant :-) <comment23629> Seriously... ROFLMAO <comment23630> @Alrescha is right. Just for completion's sake, if your Mac was constantly searching for networks and you were not opening the AirPort menu, that would then be a sign of a weak signal and your AirPort card being unable to stay connected. <comment23634> This behavior is the same on Leopard / Snow Leopard and the scanning has no real effect on the performance of anything but the CPU/GPU to make the nice spinny effect.
