Merge Spreadsheets <body> [Numbers, macOS]  I need to merge data in 2 spreadsheets / tables. Both of them contain contact information. The second table contains a column that I want to append to the first table.br Now, I can't just copy/paste the column, because even though the two tables contain the same column codeA/code, they don't contain an equal amount of rows.br For illustration, I put sample tables below.  strongTable #1/strong  precodeName       Address          Phone Mr. One    First Address    45120354554 Ms. Two    Second Address   42874518933 Mr. Three  Third Address    74125986538 Mr. Four   Fourth Address   95645740200 /code/pre  strongTable #2/strong  precodeName       Address          Website Mr. One    First Address    a@b.com Mr. Three  Third Address    e@a.com /code/pre  How could I append the codeWebsite/code column to table #1, so that if the codeName/code column matches, it pastes what it finds in table #2's codeWebsite/code column to get the result shown below?  strongTarget Table/strong  precodeName       Address          Phone         Website Mr. One    First Address    45120354554   a@b.com Ms. Two    Second Address   42874518933    Mr. Three  Third Address    74125986538   e@a.com Mr. Four   Fourth Address   95645740200    /code/pre  I'm sorry if this is hard to understand. I don't really know how to put it, so feel free to ask any question!br Thanks in advance!  <answer268243> Let's make some assumptions:  ol liThe only column in Table 2 you care about is codeWebsite/code/li liAll of the data in both codeName/code columns is 100% correct and can be matched "exactly" (i.e. not fuzzily)/li liThe columns are labeled with a "header" row (the dark gray background by default)/li liThe tables are named codeTable 1/code and codeTable 2/code/li liThe data starts on row code2/code in both tables/li /ol  Therefore we are simply going to take the desired values from codeTable 2::Website/code (Mac Numbers formula notation for "Column codeWebsite/code in codeTable 2/code") and plop them into codeTable 1::D/code.  This is actually emvery/em easy to do, and it's one of those standard spreadsheet tricks that's great to have in your back pocket. An Internet search for something like "index match excel" and "vlookup excel" will give you tons of results.  h2Solution 1 (general technique)/h2  In the first row of codeTable 1::Website/code, put this formula:  precode=IFERROR(INDEX(Website, MATCH(A2, Table 2::Name, 0), 1), "") /code/pre  Unfortunately, because Numbers thinks it's smarter than you are, it won't let me paste this in -- you'll apparently have to type it by hand. Then click and drag the yellow dot on the bottom of the cell all the way down to the bottom.  Let's unpack this from the inside out.  codeMATCH/code  Official documentation: http://help.apple.com/functions/mac/7.0/#/ffa59a83d3  codeMATCH/code takes the following arguments:  ol liValue to search for/li liRange of values to search in/li liSearch "mode"/li /ol  and returns the first position (1, 2, 3, etc.) in #2 that matches the value in #1. The documentation has more about argument #3, but 9 times out of 10 you will want to set it to code0/code,   codeINDEX/code  Official documentation: http://help.apple.com/functions/mac/7.0/#/ffa59b4edb  codeINDEX/code takes the following arguments:  ol liA range of cells to select from/li liA row in that range to select/li liA column in that range to select/li liAn area number to use in the selected cell/li /ol  We want to select from codeTable 2::Website/code, so that's what goes in to #1. The result of the codeMATCH/code call above gives us the row number we want, so that goes into #2. There's only one column in that range, so we know we want to put code1/code into 3. If #4 is omitted, it defaults to code1/code. Don't worry about this, just leave it out.  codeIFERROR/code  Official documentation:  codeIFERROR/code takes the following arguments:  ol liA value to check for errors/li liA replacement value if there's an error/li /ol  This one is self-explanatory. If codeINDEX/code fails, it will produce an error. Use this to replace those errors with blanks (or something else if you desire).  h2Solution 2 (shortcut)/h2  You can simplify this query with a shortcut function:  precode=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, Table 2::Name:Website, 3, 0), "") /code/pre  What this does is "vertically looks up" codeA2/code in the range codeTable 2::Name:Website/code and returns the value in column code3/code that from the row it found. The code0/code at the end specifies to look for an exact, rather than approximate, match. The codeIFERROR/code part is identical.  <comment336662> This operation is called a "Left Join" in database lingo. I don't know if it's possible directly in Numbers, but maybe at least knowing the term can help you search better. <comment336664> Alright I'll look for that, thanks! <comment336665> In fact I think the most robust solution would actually be to export your spreadsheets as CSVs, import them into a database (macOS comes with a database engine called SQLite already installed), do a join in the database, and then export a CSV to re-import into Numbers. <comment336666> I'm working on a Numbers-only solution, however. Is it possible that the `Address` columns disagree between tables? If so, how do you want to handle it? <comment336668> Technically that is not possible, no. What is possible, however, is that table #2 contains the "same" row multiple times. ("same" as in same `name` column) <comment336669> Actually, I'd not mind removing same columns except the `name` column obviously and leaving all the columns that table #2 contains, but table #1 does not. <comment336698> Dang. Take my upvote for the effort. I'll have a look later and will let you know if it works for me. Thanks in advance! <comment336874> Sooo here we go. I can't get solution #1 to work somehow. See my [screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qmwcfeyuer070vd/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-11%20at%2011.16.05.png?dl=0), anything wrong there? (I just renamed `Website` to `Status`) Solution #2, however, does work for me. Thanks! <comment336876> Doesn't really matter actually. I love you, thank you so much! Ha <comment336932> @LinusG. glad #2 worked. It looks like you have the wrong value in the third argument to `MATCH`.
