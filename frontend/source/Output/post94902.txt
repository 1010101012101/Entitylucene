Mailbox app: Load images? <body> I am liking the app because it shows gmail conversations in a space efficient format, and its email search actually works.   Also the ability to keep lists of stuff eminside of my email/em is pretty cool.  But it doesn't load images in emails. What's up with that?   Is there an option to enable it? Isn't this a basic feature?   Please don't say "performance reasons". The pictures should load asynchronously after all the text in the email loads.   <answer95349> This appears to work in the updated version I am running now.
