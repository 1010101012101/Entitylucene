Why use iPhoto instead of manually saving images? <body> I would like to know whether there are any advantages to using iPhoto on Mac for my pictures taken on my iPhone. For the past few years I have simply exported all images via Image Capture which stores the actual file to a location on my hard drive. Recently I have had to use iPhoto to get images off an iCloud shared stream, I have noticed when importing the images it saves into one file (almost like a database) instead of individual JPEG files.  Can someone tell me whether what pros and cons are there to using iPhoto instead of manually saving images?  <answer135054> You could have just Googled this, but here goes:  ul liOrganization is a LOT more powerful than simply using a file system: ul liFacial recognition for sorting by person/li liSort by "events"/li liSort by locations/li liArrange into albums (unlike folders, photos can reside within multiple albums)/li /ul/li liShows extra meta data, such as ul liStars/li liCamera and settings used/li liMap position/li /ul/li liAllows basic image touch ups on the spot: ul liColour-grading/li liAuto touchup (really hand, fast and convenient)/li liBuilt in "straighten" function (also very useful)/li liAuto enhance feature/li liAutomatically retains "originals" in case you want to revert an edit/li /ul/li liManages Facebook and Flickr albums/li /ul  Most things you can do in iPhoto you can do in Preview and Finder, except a lot slower.
