What are the key-names for the PressAndHold.app keyboard plists? <body> To avoid ambiguity in this question I will use codekey/code to mean a plist-dictionary-key (look-up string); and kbdkey/kbd to mean a button on your keyboard.  hr  This answer to another question identified a great way to edit the special characters you can insert using the press-and-hold method on your keyboard.  You can edit the codeKeyboard-xx.plist/code files of the codePressAndHold.app/code to add your characters to existing press-and-hold kbdkeys/kbd. The plist dictionary codekeys/code for each press-and-holdable kbdkey/kbd look like this: code&lt;key&gt;Roman-Accent-a&lt;/key&gt;/code, and code&lt;key&gt;Roman-Accent-A&lt;/key&gt;/code, etc. but if you want to add some press-and hold characters to a number kbdkey/kbd, or a punctuation kbdkey/kbd then you need to know the codekey/code name for the dictionary in order to add it.  I want to add press-and-hold characters for the kbd2/kbd and kbd3/kbd kbdkeys/kbd and possibly others, I have tried the following formats for the codekey/code names in the plist file:  precode2 Number-2 Roman-Accent-2 /code/pre  None of these add a press-and-hold popover for the kbd2/kbd kbdkey/kbd. What are the correct codekey/code names for all of my keyboard kbdkeys/kbd that I can add in codeKeyboard-en.plist/code?  <answer144683> I have actually the same question, but this may help someone that is trying to figure this out.  I found here, that the name is probably Roman-Accent-2: https://github.com/skalnik/dotfiles/blob/master/osx/emoji-expansions.plist  as this code is used:  precode&lt;key&gt;Roman-Accent-1&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;Direction&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;right&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;Keycaps&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1 1&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;Strings&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1 1&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  Also look up Keyboard-ja.plist, and you see that they use this Roman-Accent-x for almost any character x. But nevertheless, it doesn't work for me if I add it to Keyboard-en.plist. I don't understand why.
