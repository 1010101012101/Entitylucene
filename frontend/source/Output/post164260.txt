Rented movie disappeared from iTunes <body> So, I rented guardians of the galaxy to watch on a plane ride, I downloaded it the night before I left so it would have enough time to download, I checked right before I left and it was fully downloaded, then when I went on the plane and no longer had internet connection the movie was no longer in my movies or in my unwatched movies.I never started playing the movie so I should have had 30 days. what should I do?  <answer164480> My first suggestion would be to launch iTunes and from the menu bar selectbr/ Store - Check Available Downloads  If that does not work, just contact Apple Support. Reference your order number, and they should push the download back down to you.   They do have a 24 hour turn around on this, so do it earlier rather than later so you'll have it for your next flight!  http://www.apple.com/support/contact/  <answer240345> Go to the Store - Account - At the top it will say something about available downloads and if you want to download now. Click the download now button and you should be good to go.  <comment295402> "**_I downloaded it the night before I left so it would have enough time to download_**"
