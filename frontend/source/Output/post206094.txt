Retina scaling and video playback <body> I am using an early 2013 rMBP for video review prior to editing on a desktop. The clips that I am working with are 2.7k (which fits natively into the rMBP's 2880x1800) and 4k UHD (which does not). I have the following questions:  ul liIf I run my rMBP in the default 1:2 scaling ("looks like 1440x900"), what happens to the 2.7k video that I play? Do I get 1:1 pixel display, or is the video somehow downscaled as a consequence of the display scaling? What playback software can I use and be sure that I am seeing every pixel of my 2.7k video?/li liWhat video players allow me to see 100% 1:1 4k video on my rMBP? Obviously, since the MacBook doesn't have enough pixels to display the whole 4k video, this is going to involve zooming/cropping a 2880x1800 portion of the frame during playback. That's okay: I just want to be able to view a 100% crop from the centre of the frame to verify image clarity and sharpness./li /ul
