How do I find out the status of a large download from the Mac App Store? <body> I just started downloading OS X Lion, and it's 3.49 GB.  This is the extent of the user interface for the download process:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0RE9Z.png" alt="screenshot"  Is there a place to see the download progress? Can I pause and/or resume the download?  <answer17769> It's a bit of a hack, but you can check the size of ~/Library/Application Support/AppStore with Get Info in Finder -- assuming it's Lion that you're downloading, it should be about 3.5GB in total (I'm currently on 444MB, so it will take me a while).  <answer17770> Aha... found it. In the App Store application menu, you can choose strongStore/strong  strongCheck for Unfinished Downloads/strong which pops up a window like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gyGQg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer17777> You can also just check the Purchased tab.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MttvE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment19427> nice! didn't know that was there!
