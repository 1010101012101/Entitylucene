Will I be able to receive my WhatsApp chat history when i change my phone <body> I have been using a sim for two months on my iPhone and now I gave that sim to my cousin. What I am worried about is will she recieve my WhatsApp chat history when she downloads WhatsApp to her phone.  <answer162800> WhatsApp works on the phone number, not the phone, so you need to transfer your number  From the WhatsApp FAQ     Before you stop using a particular phone number or phone, you should migrate your WhatsApp account to the new number or new phone.      For a simple way to delete your old account number and migrate your data to a new number, use our Change Number feature.   <comment190583> Thanx for your response so does it mean she will not get the option to retrieve chat history and she is using an android phone
