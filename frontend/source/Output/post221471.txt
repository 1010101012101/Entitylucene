iMac FaceTime HD camera shows no image/black image <body> There's an iMac whose FaceTime HD camera isn't displaying video images in applications like FaceTime, Photo Booth, or QuickTime video recorder.

The button is on the screen, but isn't pressable./li liSkype is not installed/li /ul  What steps can I take to get the camera to capture and display video properly?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kjk7E.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongAttempts to fix/strong  ul lireset the NVRAM/li /ul  strongItems to investigate/strong  ul lishould I reset the SMC?/li liwill the Apple Hardware Test reveal anything/li /ul  I recently opened this iMac to install an SSD. All cables were re-attached properly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A7FPK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer221581> I have had this problem in the past. I found my answer here. http://osxdaily.com/2013/12/27/fix-there-is-no-connected-camera-error-mac/   Open terminal from the utilities folder in the applications folder. Type codesudo killall VDCAssistant/code into terminal and click enter.  Then, enter codesudo killall AppleCameraAssistant/code. That should do the trick.   Don't worry this will not break your computer.   <answer221611> Resetting the SMC solved the camera issue. It's now working as per normal.  All that involves is shutting down the machine, removing all power from the computer for 15 seconds, and restoring power.  <answer262056>    sudo killall AppleCameraAssistant   <answer287158> works for me after i remove icloud drive.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/50lIx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment268179> The green LED should stay solid when the camera is recording. Your troubleshooting clues: the LED flashes & you get no image, and that you recently cracked the case and played around inside, is an indication that either some of the cables were _not_ attached correctly, not fully seated, or some other damage went down whilst the iMac was open. <comment301778> My camera stops working. I google all over the place, and find various ideas of broken cables and faulty El Capitan upgrades. Then all of a sudden your answer comes up, not voted up even once. I follow the two steps. And the camera works. Thank you. <comment301807> @Paolo you're welcome! :) I was googling everywhere too. I guess I got lucky with the article I found. <comment311527> $ sudo killall AppleCameraAssistant No matching processes were found.! Any idea why <comment311550> @KunalPanchal hmm... my first suggestion would be to copy and paste directly into terminal (in case of a misspelling) but that probably won't fix it. Next, I would check activity monitor for the process and try quitting it from there. If that doesn't work, reboot and try everything again. Hope this helps! <comment328254> Providing more than a command would be useful. FWIW, some askers might not know where to input the command. <comment359352> Thank you. Restarting VDCAssistant worked like a charm <comment359353> @cavalcade no problem! <comment366824> None of this worked for me. I also put in an sdd and made a Fusion drive. I also upgraded the RAM from 4 to 6 GB... The camera is working, and does go off when I quit the app that should use it. There is no missing camera message. Green light is constantly on. Photo boot remains dark, skype simply keeps looking for the camera, waiting for the picture to come on.
