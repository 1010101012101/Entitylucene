How can I move my MS Office license to a new Mac? <body> I have purchased a new 64-bit iMac and would like to move my version of Office for Mac 11 to it from my older iMac that is a 32-bit machine.  How do I uninstall so that I may use my existing validation codes on my new iMac?  <answer111550> I had installed office on a second mac, and when I accidentally opened the first copy while the second was open.   I got an error message: "this copy of office is open on a different computer on your network" a bit creepy, but that was my reminder to delete he first copy.   (Fortunately, Open Office has no such issue.)  <answer111588> If you go to strongSystem Preferences.app  Security and Privacy/strong and block incoming connections to Word you will be able to use your license on another mac.  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liClick Security and Privacy/li liClick "Firewall"/li liClick "Firewall Options"/li liSelect "Block incoming connections" from the drop down next to Microsoft Word.app img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSUSa.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/07yJK.png" alt="enter image description here" If you want to uninstall, just delete the Microsoft Word.app from the Microsoft folder within code/Applications/code. This will also allow you to use your license again./li /ol
