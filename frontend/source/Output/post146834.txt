Is the bending issue a problem in iPhone 6 or just iPhone 6+? <body> Obviously, the bending issue is a widely known problem with the newest iPhones. Is this a problem with just the iPhone 6+ or also the iPhone 6?  <answer146835>    If you apply enough force to an inch-thick solid steel rod, it will   bend.       Same goes for the quarter-inch-thick iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (which, I   should note, have far less than a quarter of an inch of aluminum in   any one spot).       Aluminum is actually a fairly soft metal, ranking at 2.5-to-3 on the   Mohs scale of hardness.       That is to say, it's about as tough as a U.S. penny (which is actually   97.5% zinc and just plated in copper).   supSource: http://www.imore.com/yes-aluminum-iphone-6-and-6-plus-can-be-bent-if-too-much-pressure-applied/sup  I would not recommend to stick it in the back pocket of a very tight jeans, and then repeatedly sit on it.  <answer146836> It's an issue for any phone size depending on the amount of force you apply. Larger phones require less force to bend themâ€”a larger magnitude of force for a smaller phone will still bend it. Whether a device bends in your pocket depends on the force you are applying.  <comment172999> Can you improve your question?  I can't think of anything that can't be bent, and yes there's a lot of publicity around the new iPhones bending in people's pockets.  Please be more specific about exactly what you're asking.
