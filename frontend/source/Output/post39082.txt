Is there any way to reduce an app's usage of storage space on iOS 5? <body> Is there any way to get any iOS app to clean up its cache etc? I heard there's a new 'cleaning' feature in iOS 5 where apps do that automatically. But I haven't seen any of my apps do that. I really need Facebook to clean itself up because it's taking up a lot of space.  Is there any way to initiate an app clean up?  When I go to Settings  General  Usage, Facebook is listed as using 182 MB even though the app itself is only 10 MB.  <answer42882> I believe there is no way for a end-user to do this. All iOS apps will have Application_Home/Documents, Application_Home/Library, Application_Cache folders. All the files stored in these folders should be managed by application itself. So, it's true that you can't do this without jail breaking.  <answer51247> You could delete the Facebook app and then reinstall it. When you delete an app like Facebook, there's a little warning saying that deleting this app "will also delete all of its data", which is exactly what you want.  I just tried this on my iPhone - deleting the Facebook app and reinstalling it made its usage go from 47 MB to 16 MB. This is only a temporary solution of course, since as you use Facebook it'll cache images etc. to speed up your browsing, so it'll start using more space again.  <answer80620> It is definitely possible to access app sandboxes via an AFC client such as iFunBox or iPhone Explorer.  To emulate the criticized aggressive cleaning of iOS 5.0 you would empty the code[…]/Library/Caches//code and code[…]/tmp//code directories of the involved app(s), but due to the manual access involved one can perform a finer-grained selection.  The PhoneClean app also performs fully automatic or app selective cache cleaning.  <answer173884> Had the same problem.. Went into my FB  settings, and went  into apps and deleted a lot of the ones I don't use.  From 3gb storage down to 300mb. Go into the settings from your iPhone. Now to figure out how to do it on twitter  <comment44240> What indication do you have that the Facebook application is taking up a lot of space? <comment44268> Settings  General  Usage shows Facebook using up 182mb while the actual app is just 10mb. Thats because of the cache, isnt it? Not only facebook, I have other apps that take up 100mb+ space. <comment44446> I don't believe there is a way to do it without jailbreaking. <comment98938> Is another app complaining about too little space? <comment342179> This is far more difficult if you refuse to upgrade apps like Facebook and their insidious invasion of privacy issues in the more recent apps. I am using a 3+ year-old version of the fb app and it now sits at 20g of storage ;(
