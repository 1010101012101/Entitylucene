Thanks!   <answer92094> You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "Mail" to tell account "Gmail"     messages of mailbox "INBOX" whose flagged status is false and read status is true     move result to mailbox "[Gmail]/All Mail" end tell /code/pre  This would only move selected messages:  precodetell application "Mail"     selected messages of message viewer 1     move result to mailbox "[Gmail]/All Mail" of account "Gmail" end tell /code/pre  <comment108128> ok, the second script worked very well... <comment108129> how can I add it to the tool bar of mail? <comment108151> I don't know, but there is [another question about adding scripts to the toolbar](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10384/can-i-add-my-own-commands-scripts-to-the-mail-app-toolbar). If you don't want to use a shortcut, you could also run the script with Alfred or Launchbar.
