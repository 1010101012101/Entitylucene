How to Sync Outlook Web Contacts with iCloud <body> I want to sync my Outlook Web Contacts with iCloud and make iCloud as default contact in such a way when i add new contact or edit any contact in icloud, outlook web people (contacts) should be automatically updated.  I have installed outlook app and integrated in contacts and turned on the contacts sync but there are few contacts present in iCloud instead of 200+ outlook contacts.  I want to implement the above scenario, how to do that.
