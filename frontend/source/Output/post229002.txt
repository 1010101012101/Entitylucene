How do I zoom in or go full screen on images inside a gallery widget? <body> I would like to know if there is a way to make the images become full screen if they are in a gallery. I am placing gallery widgets throughout an iBook, and would like to have the students be able to view the images in their entirety if they tap on them. If there is not a way to zoom in/go full screen, is there a way to have the images fit inside the gallery widget completely to where they can see the images completely?  <comment279310> Are the students using iOS or OS X to read the books? It might not matter, but it might help get a partial answer.
