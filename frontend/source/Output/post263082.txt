Why does my Thunderbolt Display's Webcam fail to become available the first time? <body> When I first connect my MacBook Pro into it's Thunderbolt Display on my desk, everything associated with the display happily springs to life; Devices connected to it's USB ports work, ethernet springs to life and takes over networking, it's audio input/output becomes the default devices, etc. Everything that is plugged in and expected to work, works, emexcept/em for the webcam. Opening up Photo Booth right now with my MacBook Pro plugged into the Thunderbolt Display, it only sees the built-in display's webcam, even with it's lid closed, resulting in a lovely black video feed.  If I unplug emjust/em the Thunderbolt cable and then plug it back in, anywhere between 1 and 3 times, eventually the Thunderbolt Display's webcam shows up in Photo Booth's camera list.  Does it depend on plug order (Magsafe first, Thunderbolt second)? Can this be fixed so that it always shows up the first time?  This issue has happened to me for the last ~4 years I've been using a Thunderbolt Display, on any Display I've used (two I've owned, and every display in the office I've plugged into at one time or another), with the 3 or so unique MacBook Pros I've used in that timeframe.
