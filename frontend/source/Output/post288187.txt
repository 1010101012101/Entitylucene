Strange WiFi issues on iPhone <body> I have some bizarre issues with WiFi on my iPhone 7. Turning it on and off almost never does the trick - very often when the WiFi is on switching it off still keeps it on, and vice versa. My phone constantly forgets passwords for familiar WiFi network. When I pull up the control menu the WiFi switches off automatically. And the list goes on... Because of this it takes me at least 10-15 minutes to connect to a WiFi network (if I even manage to do it in the end), especially if it's the first time I connect to the network.  I went to the Apple store and got a new phone, but the issue is still there. So it's not a hardware issue.  I decided to try resetting the network settings on the phone, but again a bizarre thing - nothing changed (i.e. I still connect automatically to familiar WiFi network, which I assume must mean that the network settings did not reset).  I'm out of ideas... How can I "force reset" network settings and forget all WiFi networks? Also, how can I isolate the problem, now when I know it's not hardware related? Should I delete app by app or is there a better way of doing that?  The phone is not jailbroken. The iOS and all apps are up to date.  <comment363879> Is it linked to a Mac via iCloud? The settings are shared if so. <comment363883> Does the issue affect your personal WIFI only? <comment363884> @Tetsujin It is linked to a Mac via iCloud. Will it help if I unlink them? <comment363885> @shallowThought No, it affects all WiFi networks I try to connect to. <comment363893> Rather than unlink, which will affect more than just WiFi, try editing from the Mac instead - they ought to sync. Alternatively, clear the list entirely from the Mac & start over. <comment363897> Perhaps it's a software issue, I would restore the iPhone to factory settings and configure it as a new iPhone. Doing this will result in an iPhone without any of your data. You can then test the WiFi connectivity. If you restore from a backup (iTunes or iCloud), it is possible that you also restore "your problem" <comment363908> @Jules That's what exactly happened. When I got the new phone yesterday it worked fine until the point I restored the phone from backup. I have too many useful things on that phone to start from scratch so I'd rather somehow keep everything I restored and solve the issue, if possible... <comment363909> @Ivan Unfortunately I don't know if and how it is possible, but now you know how you can probably solve it when you have no other option <comment363910> @Tetsujin What exactly do you mean by "editing from the Mac"? <comment363912> System Prefs  Network  [select WiFi on the left]  Advanced... there's your remembered connection list - you can add, delete, rearrange priority... <comment364160> @Tetsujin Thanks! I've tried it and it didn't help.. Any other ideas why resetting network settings wouldn't work? Or is there another way to see what is causing the WiFi problems? <comment364220> Sorry, I'm pretty much out of ideas :/
