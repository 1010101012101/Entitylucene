How do I clear the default email client? <body> I do not want ANY email client as a default. Whenever I accidentally click on a link, Outlook comes up. I do not want ANYTHING to pop up.  Uninstalling is not an option. I want Outlook on the computer; I just do not want a default or anything to open if I accidentally click on a mail-link.  How can I clear the default?  I'm on OSX 10.9.2  <answer125661> The location you set your default email reader is in Mail.app:  Mail  Preferences  General  That will let you pick a different program than Outlook, but doesn't have a none option.   There is a third party system preference that I have, but I can't tell if it is discontinued or the developer's site is just down. It lets you set a default application for all sorts of "various URL schemes, file extensions, file types, Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs), and MIME types." RCDefaultApp  One of the options under email is code&lt;disabled&gt;/code which should be what you want.
