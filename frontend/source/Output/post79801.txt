I needed more space on Win7 so I did the following:  ol liCreated disk image of Windows partition, using Mac's Disk Utility/li liUsed Boot Camp Assistant to remove windows 7, and then again to resize the new Windows partition to 50% of HDD and re-install Windows 7/li liRestored DMG image to the new bigger partition/li /ol  Now I have 50% of my HDD for the Mac partition, 20% for Win7 and 30% is just empty space not being used for anything.  So the image was restored the same size it was before. Also, when I tried to boot to Windows using the option key at startup, the new Win7 is not even showing up.  Help?
