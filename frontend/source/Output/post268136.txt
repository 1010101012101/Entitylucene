Is there a way to transfer a boarding pass from Gmail to Wallet on iPhone <body> ul liiOS 10/li liiPhone 5/li liAirline: Westjet./li liEmail App:  Gmail/li /ul  I do not want to download an app every time I get a new pass.  How can I do this from GMail, rather than adding YAA?  <answer270990> Unfortunately, it's up to the airline to handle that. If there is a pass available for you Wallet, there will be an icon on the website where you can print the pass that says strongAdd to Apple Wallet/Passbook/strong  If not, you may have to download the airline's app. Even then, there's still the chance that there won't be a mobile boarding pass.  I know that with Southwest Airlines, you can only get a mobile boarding pass through their app, and only if it is a single ticket trip (i.e. no other people flying on the same purchase).
