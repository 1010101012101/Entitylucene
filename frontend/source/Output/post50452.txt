3 finger tap on word to show spanish-english translation of word <body> 3 finger tap triggers the English dictionary, but it only works to explain English words in English.  Is there any way to change a 3 finger tap to show the translation of an English word into Spanish, or a Spanish word into English?  <answer50454> You would have to add the necessary modules to Dictionary.app, e.g. see  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2011/12/more-dictionaries-for-dictionaryapp.html  <comment57896> Thanks for posting an answer, Tom!
