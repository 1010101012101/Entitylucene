CCID installation El Capitan <body> I am trying to install ccid-1.4.20 (command line) in an El Capitan enabled MacBook Air, but I am facing some issues. Instructions says that after uncompressing the file, in the generated folder I should do:  ul li./MacOSX/configure/li limake/li lisudo make install/li /ul  However at the end of the process, I get the following error:  precodeconfigure: error: libusb.h not found, install libusb or use ./configure LIBUSB_CFLAGS=... + rm -f src/Info.plist /code/pre  So I figured that codelibusb/code was missing.  I went to the codelibusb/code SourceForge project and downloaded libusb-1.0.19 and proceeded installing it. Here I get no error message(s).  Then I proceeded to retry installing, but I still have the same error. Any ideas?  hr  Material and software used:  ul liMacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013)/li li1.7 GHz Intel Core i7/li li8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3/li liMac OS X 10.11 Beta (15A278b)/li /ul  <answer212645> You may need to tell the codeconfigure/code of codeccid/code where codelibusb/code can be found. Install codelibusb/code by downloading it and then running  precode./configure make sudo make /code/pre  Then do the following for codeccid/code:  precode.configure LIBUSB_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/libusb-1.0 LIBUSB_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lusb-1.0" /code/pre  (check the version number first).  <answer237157> Way too late, but there's an installer for this as well: https://github.com/martinpaljak/osx-ccid-installer  <comment257089> Ok, gotcha (even though he said to have downloaded libusb) br / Regardless, thanks for the remarks, I'll do a better job next time! <comment257650> This solution also works on Centos 7 :D <comment257992> Good to hear mate :) <comment276078> Ok, I still get the following error: `configure: error: install pcsc-lite 1.8.3 or later, or use ./configure PCSC_CFLAGS=...`  The command I issued was: `./configure LIBUSB_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/libusb-1.0 LIBUSB_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -libusb-1.0.a"`  But in `/usr/local/lib` I have the following files: `libusb-1.0.0.dylib` `libusb-1.0.a` `libusb-1.0.dylib - libusb-1.0.0.dylib` `libusb-1.0.la`
