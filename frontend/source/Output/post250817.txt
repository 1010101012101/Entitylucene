El Capitan - Losing internet connection every 20/30 minutes <body> MBP Early 2015 keep losing internet connection! Still connected to the router but no data in or out, can't even access router settings.  If I toggle wifi on and off it will be good for 20/30 minutes and then same cycle. What should I do, what is the problem?  I know the same exact question is out there but nothing is working!  I have tried:  ul liRemove airport/network configs/li licodesudo ifconfig awdl0 down/code/li li5gHz band/li liRemoved network/li liReplaced modem/li liCleared DNS cache/li liRemoved proxies in network settings/li liDisabled "wake for wi-fi network access/li /ul  Don't know what else to do... Haven't done any PRAM or SMC resets.  <answer255307> If you create a new user account in macOS and that solves the problem, then you have a configuration issue or an app or daemon misbehaving.  If that does not solve the problem, based on the steps you've taken already, check to make sure your router/access point has its firmware up to date.   If it's up to date, you might try resetting it to its defaults.  <comment311608> Does this happen on all networks you connect to or just one? <comment311680> @samh I don't know at the moment. I will test this in couple hours on a public network. <comment317543> @samh Happens on all networks. I just tried my bootcamp and no issues at all and way faster speed than I get on osx! <comment317949> OP stated their using El Capitan, not macOS Sierra. <comment317970> I don't think my suggestions would change? If you think it should be OS X El Capitan but macOS Sierra feel free to edit the answer. <comment320279> I created a new user and nothing changed. Issue persists after sierra update as well. But bootcamp is smooth :| <comment346619> @Devrim Did you ever find a solution? Same thing is happening on my 2012 MacBook Air running El Capitan.

This lead to another issue which you can follow here + solution is also there...   http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/263232/dns-cannot-connect-to-the-internet
