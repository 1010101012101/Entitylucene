doubt regarding calibration <body> I have white MacBook (early 2009), with Snow Leopard running.  I read this following article about calibration: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/9036.html  I have doubt in step 2 It says "emAllow the battery to rest in the fully charged state for two hours or longer./em", with subnote as "emYou can use your computer during this time as long as the power adapter is plugged in./em"  strongIf I don't want to use computer after fully charging it, should I turn off and remove MagSafe Power Adapter or should I keep it on for 2 hours?/strong  Please help.  <answer22233> Keep the magsafe in for 2 hours, whether it's on or sleeping.
