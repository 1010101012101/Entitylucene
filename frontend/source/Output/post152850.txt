Change gtk theme for X11 apps <body> I am using Zim note app http://zim-wiki.org in Ubuntu and I want to use the same in my OS X.  So I've installed Zim and can launch it through X11 from menu. But all GTK apps look ugly: bad fonts w/o antialiasing  etc, standard theme looks terrible  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oxw8Y.png" alt=""  Is it any way to change it to any not so bad theme? (Ideally to yosemite like)  I use brew but I don't know package name for that (if it exist).  <answer181076> You need to copy one of the themes (from gnome-look or etc) to /Users/your_user/.themes and install gtk-chtheme via brew. There you can set theme which you want:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OtXrB.png" alt="enter image description here"  So now Zim looks as follow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lv5gp.png" alt="enter image description here"
