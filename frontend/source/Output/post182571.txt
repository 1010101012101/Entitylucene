bash- command not fount error <body> I tried to install omnet++ on my Macbook pro (OS 10.10) yesterday. I got an error so I delete path in my bash-profile.   Now, every command I try to run in my terminal shows an error of command not found. I try many ways but did not find a answer.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TvvLv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer182610> First, get your PATH back emfor the current shell/em by running  precodePATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" export PATH /code/pre  Then fix the PATH problems  ul liedit your bash-profile and put back the line you've deleted. If you don't remember, take the two lines from above/li licodepath_helper/code takes its input from the files in code/etc/paths.d/code, at least one of those files seems to be corrupt (the last two entries in the output look kind of strange). To fix, run code/bin/ls -l /etc/paths.d/code to get the name of the file containing the additions for omnet++ (should be named accordingly) and remove it with codesudo /bin/rm /etc/paths.d/NAME-OF-FILE/code/li /ul  <comment217418> What explicitly and specifically do you mean by _"I got an error so I delete path in my bash-profile"_?  Also from `man path_helper`: "The path_helper utility should not be invoked directly.  It is intended only for use by the shell profile." <comment217448> reset terminal back to the root directory. <comment217449> this might help http://superuser.com/a/498356 <comment217452> You've basically deleted the path, which means the shell cannot find commands in `/usr/bin` and other such locations (those are the locations that contain commands like `tar`, `touch`, and everything). @Buscarì›ƒ 's pointing to something that will indeed help. Add the path back into the `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`, restart the shell, and that should be it.
