How can I fix the OS X dictionary lookup feature for StackExchange comments in Google Chrome? <body> When I use the "Look up emword/em" right-click menu option on a StackExchange comment in OS X, the system selects other text and looks that up instead:  Step 1: select a word in a StackExchange comment to look up  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dn2EX.png" alt="select text"  Step 2: right click &amp; "Look up emword/em"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCqcq.png" alt="right-click, &quot;Look up _word_&quot;"  Step 3: watch OS X select some other text next to yours and look that up instead:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UOgtp.png" alt="OS X selects other text and looks that up instead"  ol liWhy?/li liHow can I fix this?/li /ol  I'm using OS X 10.10.5.  It appears to shift the selected text by 10 characters to the right in all cases, and happens in Chrome but not Safari.  <answer230205> I'd be tempted to try the "standard toolkit"…  Do all of these, in this order.  ul liReset the SMCbr As I don't know which Mac you have, read this for instructions for your specific machine - https://support.apple.com/HT201295/li liReset the NVRAMbr At the boot chimes, hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd P /kbd kbd R /kbdbr Keep holding all 4 keys until you hear the chimes again, then release./li liFix permissions, Verify &amp; if necessary Repair disk, using Disk Utility/li liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLs using OnyX  [make sure you get the version appropriate to your OS]  - Maintenance tab/permissions, tick the box at the top then Execute./li liRe-apply the 10.10.5 update using the 10.10.5 combo update, not the delta from App Store/li /ul  <answer255475> I know some ways to get the dictionary to work for Stack Exchange comments (and a few other places I've seen this happen on the internet):  ul liHover over the word, and use kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdD/kbd./li liThree finger tap the word.

There are two lines in the source code (that only appear if you have privileges to upvote/flag):  precode&lt;a class="comment-up comment-up-off" title="this comment adds something useful to the post"&gt;upvote&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre    precode&lt;a class="comment-flag" title="Flag this comment for serious problems or moderator attention"&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre  However, the problem is resolved if you change those lines to:  precode&lt;a class="comment-up comment-up-off" title="this comment adds something useful to the post"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre    precode&lt;a class="comment-flag" title="Flag this comment for serious problems or moderator attention"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre  hr  I may see about opening a meta post about this to see if they can fix it.  <comment280929> 1) Does this also  happen when you don't select a word/phrase, but simply move the mouse on a word then right-click?  2) Does this happen with a mouse or the trackpad, or with both? – 3) Does this happen in all applications? – 4) Does this also happen when you just copy text? <comment289475> @DictionaricsAnonymous In fact, it only happens when I try to look up words in StackExchange comments. I'm assuming there is some style/script magic which is interfering with the way OS X parses the text but haven't figured it out yet. <comment289476> @DictionaricsAnonymous To your questions: 1. both 2. only tested with trackpad, don't have mouse 3. no, see edit 4. no
