Changing Apple ID on iPhone 5 <body> How can I change my Apple ID on my iphone 5 to match the Apple ID on my iPad Air? I have an old email from school that does not exist anymore attached to my iPhone5. I am trying to get the same Apple ID on both devices so that they will communicate with each other. I will be getting a new iPhone 6 this week so I don't know what to do first because I will be trading in my iPhone 5.  <answer191469> From the Apple Support Site     h2 Use these steps to reset your Apple ID:/h2      ol   liSign out of iCloud, the iTunes Store, App Store, FaceTime, Find My Friends, Find My iPhone, and iMessage on each device that uses your current Apple ID for these services./li   liGo to My Apple ID./li   liSelect Manage your Apple ID and sign in.
