How do I restore a Deja Dup backup (done in Ubuntu) in Mountain Lion? <body> I have pretty much started from scratch on my new installation because I couldn't figure out how to restore the files I backed up on my Linux installation with Deja Dup. I have GPG Keychain access installed, so what do I need to do to restore the files I had and look at them and see what I want to keep?  I really appreciate any answer you can give :)  <answer89512> One option would be to use VirtualBox to install the Linux distribution of your choice and then run Deja Dup from there.   <answer280129> Deja dup uses duplicity for storage. You may want to use duplicity in the command line, which is available for macOS.  Install it with Homebrew like this (install Homebrew first if you don't have it yet):  codebrew install duplicity/code  Then restore with something like:  codeduplicity --file-to-restore the/file/you/want/to/restore file:///backup/location /where/you/want/to/restore/code  Not sure if this will help OP, but could help other people.  <comment105073> Deja Dup is unknown in the OS X world, you might want to ask in the Deja Dup forum as well. <comment105128> That makes a lot of sense, and I do have a Virtual Machine with Ubuntu! Thanks a lot, this is the answer I'm looking for! <comment352327> Can you add some information on how to get duplicity for macOS and how to use it in this scenario ?
