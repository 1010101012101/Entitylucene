How to set the Display aspect ratio to 16:9 explicitly when using a VGA adaptor <body> strongBackground/strong  I was presenting at a venue where the projector supports 1280x720px resolution (16:9) via VGA cable (I've previously used the same room and equipment on an older 2011 MacBook Pro running Mavericks).  Yesterday I used a newer 2014 MacBook Pro Retina running Yosemite, and was unable to set this resolution - the closest I could choose was 1280x1024px.  When the MacBook is mirroring to a projector via VGA cable, the em System Preferences   Display/ems panel looks something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fPjTB.png" alt="enter image description here" In my case the only options were 1280x1024px and 800x600px (this image is from the web - I didn't get a screenshot at the time).  strongMy question/strong  Is there anywhere, other than the em System Preferences  Displays/em dialog, where you can explicitly set/force the output resolution?  My only options were 1280x1024 or 800x600, yet I'm positive the projector supported 16:9 since I've used it before.  <answer177202> Displays under System Preferences is it from the OS X built-in UI side.  There are third-party utilities like Display Menu that offers additional resolutions.  There is also cscreen if you want to do it in Terminal or incorporate it in a script.  <answer209077> Display menu doesnt do 16:9 on a Retina MBP...only 16:10 and 4:3  <answer214183> I had the same problem yesterday. I needed to do recording on Windows (a Parallels VM) in 1280x720 (16:9), and Parallels always resets my Windows resolutions to whatever Macbook sees even when I use the config options Parallels say should not mess with that.  I wrote this exact command with cscreen:  precodecscreen -x 1280 -y 720 -r 60 /code/pre  Which allowed my Macbook to show this resolution in the series of resolutions I see in Retina Display Menu (RDM) - I had to quit and reopn RDM, no log off or reboot required.  Then I just selected it from there, reverted my Parallels to the original setting of following whatever Macbook uses (I think I needed to reboot the VM), and it just worked.  <answer277592> In the monitor/display settings just press the Option key when selecting the "scaled" option. Then additional resolution options will show up.  <comment358943> It's crazy that the "expert" mode needs a second hidden "actual real expert" mode...
