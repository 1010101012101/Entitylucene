Time machine restored recovery partition, now I have two <body> So I got my MacBook serviced by the Apple store and they had to wipe the whole SSD and restore it. It came with 3 partiions: EFI, OS X and a recovery. I restored my Time Machine backup (which I didn't know contains the old recovery partition as well) and now I have two... How can I tell Time Machine not to restore the recovery partition next time?
