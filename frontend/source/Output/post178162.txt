OS X - How do I remove photos from my iPhone using the Photos app after import? <body> strongOS/strong: OS X 10.10.3 (Yosemite) strongMachine/strong: Macbook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) strongiPhone/strong: 5s on 8.2 (12D508)  So I import all photos/videos off of my iPhone to Photos on a daily basis after upgrading from iPhoto and it works well overall, so far.  The problem is that, while Photos does give me the option to "Delete items after import", the option becomes greyed out after some imports and there are some items that get left behind on the iPhone (they are successfully imported but do not get deleted).  iPhoto would let me delete already-imported photos, but Photos does not. I also do not sync Photos using iTunes.  I have two inconvenient workarounds to this:  ol liSelect all photos in Photos app, check "Delete items after import" and click "Import Selected" again. This may or may not create duplicates -- I'm not sure./li liManually delete each photo on my iPhone like a cave person/li /ol  So my question is this-  Is there a more automatic way to do this (without duplicates), since I'm doing it on a regular basis?  <answer178245> I'd go for the 'not quite cave-man' approach - though still a bit manual...  ul liLaunch Image Capture./li liPlug in iDevice/li liSelect any/all photos you wish to delete/li liThe Delete button is at the bottom of the window [the 'no-entry' sign]/li /ul  After comments - the button is still there in Yosemite.  Update Nov 2015 - the button is still there in El Capitan, though it is now black &amp; white, not red.    Picture updated to Image Capture 6.7 after further queries on the button not being there.  emUpdate July 2016, as people are still missing this bit.../em  h1If the Delete button doesn't appear, eject &amp; re-plug the phone./h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zU9oe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer214453> i noticed that the 'delete upon import' option does not show when plugging in an iphone to a new computer for the first time. a simply eject and reopen seems to fix this  i just ran into this problem with both my partner and i  <answer263573> Your workaround #1 is probably simplest if the photos you’ve already imported are interspersed throughout your camera roll. Full instructions:  ol liIn Photos, check the “Delete items after import” box on the import page/li liSelect all the photos in the Already imported section, and import them/li liOpen the “Last Import” album, select all the items, and delete them/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nfMUY.png" alt="Delete items after import checkbox"  In step 2, you’re creating duplicates of all the previously imported items. In step 3, you are deleting all those duplicates. Meanwhile, step 2 deleted all the items off your iPhone.  If you don’t see the “Delete items after import” checkbox, refer to Austin’s advice to unplug/replug your device, or restart the app. Also this answer only applies if you do not use iCloud Photos - I don’t know what the particulars are, but it sounds like using that service complicates matters.  <comment211130> Does your iPhone participate in any or all of "iCloud Photo Sharing" or "My Photo Stream" or "iCloud Photo Library (Beta)" - the status of each of these has subtle (and mostly undocumented by Apple) implications for how the "camera roll" behaves on iOS 8.2 and later in my experience. Similarly, does the Photos app on Mac participate in any of the above? <comment211218> This is what I normally do. Upvoted. <comment221612> This works but its so lame. Hope apple will release an update soon... But thank you for this tip! <comment227856> @Tetsujin I can't see this button in Yosemite. Are you sure they didn't remove it? <comment227857> Certain. This is my standard method, I'd notice if it disappeared. <comment254036> Using image capture with el capitan, I also do not see the delete button. <comment254040> Delete button highlighted in updated answer <comment270034> ImageCapture version 6.7 (OSX 10.11) does not have the delete button which is what brought me here.  I just read a blog post where the author claims that Apple wants us to migrate to using their cloud service rather than direct import.  I hope it's not the case because I don't want to be forced to depend on a cloud service. <comment270036> Are you running El Capitan (10.11?)  I am having this same issue.  I am used to both the delete button and delete upon import option. <comment270039> Can you confirm what version of Image Capture you are using?  In about Image Capture I get 'Version 6.7 (604)' <comment270040> El Capitan 11.2 Image Capture 6.7(604) The button is still there, though as mentioned in my earlier edit, now in greyscale, not red. I'll update my picture... <comment270082> Yes I'm on 10.11 and the delete option has become available <comment270085> Interesting.  It didn't work for me.  Just curious can you check which version of Image Capture you are running (in About Image Capture)?  Mine says "Version 6.7 (604)". <comment273868> Image capture 6.7, el capitan, no button... <comment289920> Weird, I have no delete button in Image Capture either. An arrow like `⤴️` is all I see <comment294971> I saw this behavior as well. Plugging in iPhone for the first time (trust, don't trust dialog comes up) for some reason hides the button. Replugging the phone showed it. <comment305714> I didn't see the delete button in Image Capture either. Solved it like this: 1. Open Image Capture with the iPhone connected 2. Disconnect the iPhone (don't close Image Capture) 3. Connect the iPhone 4. The delete button is now visible in Image Capture  Strange, but true.
