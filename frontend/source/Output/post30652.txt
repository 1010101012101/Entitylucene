prevent desktops/fullscreen windows from being re-ordered <body> When an application gains focus, it can change the order of desktops in mission control.

(I saw the thread here, nothing seemed to wrok.)  <answer30717> Please, look this and this QAs which have answers for your questions.  <comment35227> Which thread did you see? Links help. <comment35293> Which does answer not work for you exactly?
