Creating a new contact in contact list but it doesn't show <body> I've found lately that whenever I add a new contact it then doesn't show in my contact list either in the app or the phone. If I receive a call from them their name shows and if I want to send a message I can type in their name but I can't search for them if I want to call them for the first time.   I haven't changed any settings in my phone and wonder how to make this change.   <answer288037> Sounds like an issue with contact groups.  There are two places to check.  First from a contacts list screen click "Groups" in the top left and see if you have any contact groups that are unchecked.    Second go to Settings  Contacts and see what default account is set.  This effects what group is used when creating new contacts.
