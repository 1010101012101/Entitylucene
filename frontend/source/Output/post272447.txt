Adding a Google account in iMessage appears to be stuck <body> I want to add a Google Hangouts / Talk account to iMessage. I am on OS X 10.12.3 (Sierra). After logging in to my Google account and after entering OTP, it brings me to a white screen that appears to be stuck. I already tried disabling OTP but it still gets stuck. I attached a screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgYjU.png" alt="stuck google login"  Anybody seeing the same issue?  <answer272448> After retrying many times, it finally showed the following error message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t0uNg.png" alt="account already exists"  This account already exists. You are already signed-in to the account ...  To fix I just went to System Preferences  Internet Accounts, selected the Google account, then checked Messages.  <comment370023> How did this fix it? I get this error message whether or not the "Messages" box in System Preferences is checked.
