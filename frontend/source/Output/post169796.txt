Remove my full name from startup screen <body> Whenever I open the computer the login screen shows up with my account picture and full name. Is there any way to remove it or replace it with the account name or something like that?  <answer169798> You can change under System Preferences → User &amp; Groups → Login options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HW5U0.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you select codeName and password/code, the login window will appear as usual, but there will no longer be a list of users and accounts shown, instead a basic prompt for a complete username and password is necessary to login to the Mac.  <answer169807> At the bottom of this Apple Support page you will find the steps you must take to change the full name.  On Yosemite, opening the user profile while holding down the kbdcontrol/kbd key and then selecting Advanced Options leads you to this screen.  Change strongonly/strong the Full name field:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k1ipi.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer169808> You can change the emFull Name/em for a given user account. From Apple:     ul   liGo to Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Users &amp; Groups./li   liIf the lock icon in the corner of the window is locked, click the icon to unlock it. Enter the admin name and password, if prompted./li   liFrom the list of users, open a shortcut menu by kbdControl/kbd+clicking the user that you want to rename. Choose "Advanced Options" from the   shortcut menu./li   liChange the name in the "Full name" field, then click OK./li   /ul   Changing the emFull Name/em here will change the name shown on the login screen you described. strongDO NOT/strong change the short name (or anything else for that matter). Read the warning if you are tempted to change anything other than the emFull Name/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXUYP.png" alt="Warning from the Advanced Options"  Given this warning I would highly recommend making a backup before performing any changes.   I can confirm that updating the emFull Name/em (and nothing else) here will not prevent you from logging in. strongHowever, there is always the chance that this will have other unintended consequences/strong. If needed, you could take these steps again to revert back to the accounts original emFull Name/em.  <comment199491> So I cant have list of Users without full names? <comment199493> Nop, just a couple of text boxes to enter username and password. <comment199494> But event that doesnt really change it. I still see my full name. It only changes it for the login screen that shows up after you log out <comment199507> But I don't see any shortcut menu or Advanced settings there. Could it be because the account is linked to an apple ID ?
