Automator: Start at Current Folder <body> I am creating a simple Automator App, which requires selecting a folder. I know that I can use "Ask for Finder Items" to do that.  There is a codeStart at:/code item which has a list of folders or allows me to choose one of my own. I also see an option for New Variable, but I donâ€™t know how that works.  The question is, how can I set codeStart at:/code to be the current Finder window?
