Creating bootable usb drive with Sierra <body> My mac is kind of a mess right now so I wanted to fresh install MacOS Sierra.  I bought myself a brand new 8gb pendrive since is pre req.  But I cant seem to get it properly erased, I always get this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q05yn.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I try by terminal following this tutorial I also get this error:  precodeThe operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.apple.DiskManagement error -69874.) /code/pre  I also tried Using Install Disk Creator but I think the same thing happens because he probably use Diskutil commands:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0DPyn.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I am kinda lost here and don't know what else to do.  Ps: I went to the store and changed my pendrive for another one and the same things happen Ps2: In every retry I had to go on a windows laptop to format again. And it works just fine copying files and it show on my mac until the unmounting processes begin  Is there any other way I fix this?
