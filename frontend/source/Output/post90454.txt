Safari Toolbar Icons Blank <body> Regularly, after some time using Safari, 3rd party icons in Safari toolbar become blank.  Restarting Safari fixes the problem, but after some time it happens again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAQAj.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer90935> This looks to be a valid bug with the Safari browser. You can file a report here.  <answer139234> This happens to me as well. Only 3rd party buttons go blank.  ol liGo to Preferences  Extensions/li liTurn Extensions OFF/li liTurn Extensions ON/li /ol  The icons should come back.  <comment106202> Are there any relevant log messages in Console / system.log? <comment107043> Do you have any evidence that this is a Safari bug? Might be a problem with one of the 3rd party extensions as well. <comment107044> Did you try to disable extensions and observe Safari's behavior then?
