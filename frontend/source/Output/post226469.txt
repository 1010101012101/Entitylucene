Reliable way to downgrade iPad 2 to iOS 6 without SHSH <body> Recently I upgraded my iPad 2 from iOS 7 to iOS 9 which made it slower and buggy (apps frequently crashing). I have regretted ever upgrading to iOS 7 let alone iOS 9. Recently I found some sites (eg this one) which offer ways to do exactly what I want: get my iPad 2 back to iOS 6.  (I'm not sure what sites / instructions to trust but I do generally trust StackExhange advice. I am concerned what the effect would be downloading software from some of these sites.)  A few parameters:  ol liI don't have backups (eg SHSH)/li liI would prefer to keep some data (eg saved games)/li liIdiot proof instructions would be a huge plus/li liI am prepared to jail break as part of the procedure but want to be left with an unbroken iPad/li /ol  Can anyone tell me a fool-proof and trustworthy way to downgrade?  Edit, why I don't think this is a dupe: emI don't think that is a duplicate because there the answer to that general question is that it is no longer possible. But this specific case does appear to be possible in light of recent developments. Plus one answer mentions many devices but strongnot the iPad 2/strong. Finally, that same answer has strongSHSH as a pre-requisite/strong, my question excludes that./em  <answer227780> The lowest version you can go with an iPad 2 and without SHSH blobs is iOS 6.1.3. This is because Apple still signs OTA (over-the-air) iOS firmware for this version. You can use OdysseusOTA to downgrade to this version, but only if you're jailbroken. If you're not, then you can't. And only iOS &lt;= 9.0.2 can be jailbroken currently. Read my answer on this question for more information about OdysseusOTA.  All tools that claim to be able to downgrade are simply forks of Odysseus and/or its process. Odysseus is the only tool that can do such things at this time.  For a video explaining how to use OdysseusOTA, watch this YouTube video from its author.  <comment275005> Possible duplicate of [Can I install any iOS version I wish by picking and choosing which firmware to restore?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/102928/can-i-install-any-ios-version-i-wish-by-picking-and-choosing-which-firmware-to-r) <comment275008> @Tetsujin: I don't think that is a duplicate because there the answer to that general question is that it is no longer possible. But this specific case *does* appear to be possible in light of recent developments. <comment277476> I'm the downgrade info guy from the "possible duplicate" question. You can use OdysseusOTA to do what you want but ONLY if you're jailbroken. If you're not, then you can't. Simple as that. And only iOS = 9.0.2 can be jailbroken currently. Read my answer on that question for more information about OdysseusOTA. I would argue that this question is an exact duplicate of the other question since I already go over this information there. All tools that claim to be able to downgrade are simply forks of Odysseus. Odysseus is the *only* tool that can do such things at this time. <comment277502> @AndrewLarsson That comment really needs to be an answer proper to this. Great info and then linking back to the main post. +1 for the excellent work here. <comment277638> Can I back up files eg saved games and then restore them, will that work? <comment277647> No, you cannot. The backups only work going forward in versions, not backwards. Even if you edit the backup to claim that it's for iOS 6.1.3, the backup will likely fail. You are welcome to try [this method](http://www.jailbreakqa.com/questions/103342/how-to-restore-a-51-backup-on-501-firmware), but there are absolutely no guarantees about any part of such process. <comment277650> Remember to take into consideration the fact that many apps no longer support iOS 6. Most now require at least iOS 7, or in some cases, iOS 8.
