A shortcut for Merge all Windows on macOS Sierra <body> Are there any shortcut for the command merge all windows feature that comes with macOS Sierra? I did not encounter about an shortcut for this command and I did not see any property in Automator app. If is it possible, it will be nice improvement for productivity when we working with tabs rather than windows.  <answer258417> This one works for me just fine for Safari and Finder:  precodetell application "Safari"     activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Safari"             click menu item "Merge All Windows" of menu "Window" of menu bar 1         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  Let me know if this solves your issue.  edit: This script works for any active app that supports "Merge all windows":  precodetry     tell application "System Events" to tell (first process where it is frontmost) to click menu item "Merge All Windows" of menu "Window" of menu bar 1 end try /code/pre  <answer258423> ol liOpen strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongShortcuts/strong → strongApp Shortcuts/strong./li liClick the code+/code to add a new shortcut./li liChoose emAll Applications/em from the strongApplication/strong dropdown./li liAs the strongMenu Title/strong, enter emMerge All Windows/em (*see note at the bottom)./li liInput a key combination of your choice as the strongKeyboard Shortcut/strong. I use kbdCtrl ^/kbdkbdW/kbd./li /ol  Now all applications with a menu item called strongMerge All Windows/strong will respond to that key combination, and collapse all your windows into one.  Starting with Sierra, it is also possible to open documents in new tabs rather than in new windows. This is enabled by going into strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongDock/strong and setting strongPrefer tabs when opening documents/strong to emAlways/em.  If you would like new Terminal sessions to open as new tabs as well, you can achieve this by placing a file named code.bashrc/code in code~/code (your codeHome/code folder), with the following line in it:  codeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to click menu item "Merge All Windows" of menu "Window" of menu bar 1 of process "Terminal"' &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1/code  strongNote/strong: emMerge All Windows/em may differ based on your operating system's language. If you are not using the emEnglish (US)/em locale, open strongFinder/strong, and click the strongWindow/strong menu to determine the name of that command in your locale.  <comment323013> Merge all windows in what application? <comment323014> any app that supports merge all windows feature like safari, finder, maps, etc. <comment323030> it solves mostly thanks but I must implement this feature every app that support this feature. Can I specify tell applicaion "Safari" or "Evernote" or "Maps" for supporting all apps with single shortcut? Otherwise, I must create different shortcuts for every Automator script for supporting different apps. <comment323035> I've added a universal script to my answer. <comment323038> Thanks, it's very good approach. Could you note that 'Merge All Windows' defined as system's default language? <comment323039> Good point; amended. Thank you! <comment323040> Well, let's go a step further. When I open a new tab, is this script can be trigger the merge all windows automatically? <comment323042> I'm glad that it works for you. Regarding the tabs: Unfortunately that's not possible.
