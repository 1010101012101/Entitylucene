Is there an alternative/customizer app for Cmd+Tab that does not show minimized/hidden windows and apps? <body> Is there an alternative/customizer app for kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd that does not show minimized/hidden windows and apps?  Sometimes I have many apps running (Calendar, Mail, Twitter, etc.), but all of them are minimized and my focus is on, say, two apps: my IDE and the browser.  So I want kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd to only show my browser and IDE.  Is there a way to achieve this?  <answer49421> If you hold command and quickly tap tab you will cycle between your two most recently used applications without bringing up the heads up display.  If you want to use a third party app Witch has options to ignore minimized windows.   <comment56684> quick tab tapping won't work for cycling between more than 2 apps. Witch looks good, and can ignore minimized windows, but can't ignore hidden ones. <comment56783> You could also permanently remove applications from view of Command Tab with http://foggynoggin.com/dockdodger They could be in the dock but wouldn't have an indicator light.
