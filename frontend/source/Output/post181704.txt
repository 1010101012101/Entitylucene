Tags not associated in OS X <body> I have tags assigned to my user created text file and it wouldn't show on finder.  I have assigned, Green icon / tag (renamed to environments) to associate a text file. Tag gets assigned good. Atleast thats what i see.  But when i click on the Green tag on the sidebar of the finder, to get all files associated with green, it does not work.   I did try restarting my Mac for the settings to take effect to no avail.

What happens when you change the sorting from `Kind` (if that's what's selected) to `Name`? <comment216127> Is it only that Tag or all of them not working? <comment216143> I have 85% free left on my HDD. Even if i change sorting to any other kind, it wouldnt work. <comment216144> Its just not the tag, what is in there, all others are not working too. I think tag functionality is somehow not working in mine. <comment216176> I just figured out that if i do the tagging in my internal HDD, it works, but if i try to tag contents from external HDD, they dont work.  Very interesting, Any one seen this before? <comment216185> Basically the following has to be done.  1. Issued sudo mdutil -i on "/Volumes/External-SSD” and got back "Indexing and searching disabled.” for external HDD.  2. Defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true ; killall Finder (shows all file) 3. Go to hdd where indexing is not working. externalssd in my case. find locate .metadata_never_index & delete it. 4. sudo mdutil -i on "/Volumes/External-SSD” started spotlight indexing and indexes are created. 5. Tags working now.  This concludes that Tag functionality is dependant on spotlight and needs to be enabled. <comment216186> stupid apple support wasted my time, blaming my external HDD. IDIOTS. <comment216368> Tag functionality (being able to tag files) is not dependent on Spotlight. _Searching_ for tags using Finder, which in turn uses Spotlight to return results, is. Your screenshot above shows the green "Environments" tag selected in Finder, which is really just a custom search or search folder where the criteria is "tag is Environments". <comment216411> Sorry when spotlight functionality is not on, then you would not be able to get files tagged on to those. Try, test it.
