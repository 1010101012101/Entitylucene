How to make Pages default to the folder of the opened file when exporting a PDF version? <body> I regularly create documents in Pages, then convert them to a PDF using strongFile → Export/strong. I always save the PDF versions in the same folder as the original document.  This save dialog that opens always seems to remember the latest location that I saved to. However, for me it would be much more useful if it just assumed I want to save to the same directory as the original file.  How can I make Pages do this?  <answer46923> There is a fantastic app called Default Folder X – but it's not cheap – around US$35. It enables a plethora of features that you can use in the Open/Save dialog of strongany/strong app.  On the free side, you could try this trick: when you are in the dialog window for Exporting, you can actually emdrag/em a file from the Finder eminto/em the Export window, and it will automatically change to that same folder. This at least saves you from having to navigate around in the dialog window, since you are likely to have the window for the folder of the original document already open in Finder.  Finally, just in case you didn't already know, the little pop-up at the top of most Open/Save/Export dialog windows lists your 5 most "Recent Places" at the bottom. So if you used "Open..." to open a file, that folder will likely appear in this list.

This makes finding it much faster within all dialog boxes, regardless of the app I'm using./li liWithin Pages, you can expand the dialog box, and there is a search bar – search for the name of your folder, double-click on it to select, and export/save. /li /ol  <comment53716> Thanks for the Default Folder X tip! I’d prefer a free solution that doesn’t depend on third-party software though, but it may just not be possible. <comment137533> Not very quick, but you can right click document name, open enclosing folder with the Finder, and then drag drop the folder (in Finder title bar) to the "Where:" folder. Got same "issue" with Keynote. <comment187174> This isn't a `Pages` function or bug. This is a problem one encounters with every application. When you are working with different folders and not saving everything within a uniq huge bulk folder, every application wants to save a new file where you did it the **last time** and never where you are working **right now**.
