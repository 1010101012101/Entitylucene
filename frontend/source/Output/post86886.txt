Distinguishing iPad with Retina Display and iPad2 <body> Tomorrow I will buy a 2nd hand iPad with Retina Display. But I do not have an idea how I can distinguish it from ipad 2. I know retina display is a very significant difference for experienced users. However I have never used an ipad 2 or ipad 1 so I cannot understand the difference.  What is the best way to distinguish two of them? It seems like there does not exist any logo like ipad 2 or ipad with retina display on the back of the device. Is there a way to understand it from settings menu or somewhere else?  Regards  <answer86887> The serial numbers (on the back in small print, near the bottom) will be different depending on the model. If you check this post you can write down the model number for the version you're buying, in case you're worried about getting scammed. The iPad 3 model numbers all begin with A14.
