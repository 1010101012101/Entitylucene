Dropbox and locate? <body> I frequently use the codelocate/code command to find files on my machine, but it doesn't index the Dropbox folder.  I can't find any way to configure the folder selection.  Is there a way to include dropbox in the locate database (locatedb)?  (locate is not enabled by default on mac; you have to run codesudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb/code to set it up the first time)  <answer211006> Locatedb is controlled by the file code/etc/locate.rc/code. You can add your dropbox path to the line starting with codeSEARCHPATHS/code.  <comment254710> Thanks, I am trying it.  Any idea why the default path, `/`, is not including Dropbox? <comment254714> I'm guessing because it's got a special extended attribute - you can see this by doing `ls -ld@ ~/Dropbox`.
