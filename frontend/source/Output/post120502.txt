How to read apple HDD on linux without root privileges? <body> My question is very simple. I just want to read my Apple HDD on my linux computer without root privileges.  My goal is only to read and copy some file from my home directory (in Documents). Currently I can read the content of code~//code but I can't read code~/Documents/code.  <comment140533> I think you'd have more luck asking this on http://askubuntu.com/, as many of us don't use Linux and this is more specific a Linux based question. <comment140538> @Robuust Ok thanks.
