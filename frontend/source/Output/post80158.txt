Dig not returning authority section? <body> Digging wikipedia.com, on my Macbook Pro, returns:  precode$ dig wikipedia.com  ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; wikipedia.com ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 40153 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;wikipedia.com.

Or, is my Mac at home set up differently than my Mac at work? Not sure how to test these theories.  Also, I could be mistaken that I ever did have codedig/code working on my home laptop (I just don't remember for sure). Either way, I'm getting the results I want from my work Mac, and not from my laptop/home Mac. Why would the two differ?  <answer80171> Hmmm. Not too sure if it is a flag issue, but why not do this:  precodedig SOA wikipedia.com /code/pre  My results:  precode; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; SOA wikipedia.com ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 20716 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;wikipedia.com.

So I dug a little deeper. Not sure what exactly happened to all DNS servers, but a majority of them do not return 'authority' section anymore. Even with +authority flag. And neither for +additional.  But I knew webdig still worked for some. So tried webdig.  http://digwebinterface.com/?hostnames=google.com&amp;type=&amp;showcommand=on&amp;colorize=on&amp;useresolver=8.8.4.4&amp;ns=all&amp;nameservers=  I have saved the results on my pc to prove I am not crazy. But you can see yourself, that only a few DNS servers return the authority section at the moment.  codedig xxxxxxx.xx NS/code still works and gets you the name servers in answers section. But no more authority section.  If you confirm the same, that would tell me I am not dreaming this.

I've updated my question to provide you with the `dig` results I get from work, which do return an authority section (for both google.com and wikipedia.com). **Note:** I'd upvote your reply, but I don't have enough rep... Sorry about that. :( <comment92615> Good idea! Thank you for tip. I am not at my home computer atm, but I'll try that when I get home to see how it works. Also, I've updated my original post with more info in case you're interested to see the results I'm getting when I use `dig` on my work computer (on different network). **Note:** I'd upvote your reply, but I don't have enough rep... Sorry about that. :( <comment117642> @mhulse You should have plenty of reputation to case up votes. Please ping me if you really cannot up vote this answer (It' at +1) now so I know the voting here works (as I cast the first up vote myself just now) <comment118034> @bmike Looks like I'm able to upvote now. Not sure why I wasn't able to do so back when I posted this question. Thanks for the nudge. :)
