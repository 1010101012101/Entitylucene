Old home folder not recognized after upgrade, how to recover? <body> Upon first boot after updating from 10.6.x to 10.8.x my friend started creating a new user account rather than importing the old one.  When I look in ~/Users/.. I see /new_account and /old_account, but when on the login screen I'm only seeing New Account and Guest.  Is there an easy way to get OS X to recognize the Old Account?  I was thinking there was something like blessing the folder, or maybe I need to add a user account with a matching name?  <answer84873> If you create a new account with the same name, it should prompt you to use the existing User folder.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A9c2C.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment97760> Thanks, I remembered there was something like this, just didn't want to start off down the wrong path and mess up my friends MBA.
