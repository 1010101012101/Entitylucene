Start the recording using the MIDI piano keyboard? <body> Is it possible, in GarageBand, to start/stop the recording using the midi piano keyboard as it is, for instance with Cubase? My piano is quite far from my mac and I want to start recording from my piano. (I know about the count-down feature)  PS : With cubase, you can define a key on your piano that will be used as command key.  <answer94630> If you have any other buttons available on your keyboard, you can use the GarageRemote software to program them as transport controls for GarageBand. Instructions for M-Audio Axiom series keyboards are available here. I'm not sure about programming an actual keyboard key.  <comment109654> What version of Cubase do you have? <comment109706> Runs on Atari ST 1024 :-)
