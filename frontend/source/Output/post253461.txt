Input method for Chinese Hanzi AND pinyin <body> Is there an input method, bundled or third-party, that will let me do both pinyin and hanzi without constantly changing methods?  (And do it easily enough that I won't decide to change methods instead)  OSX, IOS, or both.  I assume anyone who can answer knows what hanzi and pinyin are, but just in case, here is a sample: 爱 is hanzi for "love" and the pinyin showing how to pronounce it is ài.
