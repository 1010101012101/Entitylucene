I sync'ed twice for my iPhone 4S and my iMac, but it still asked me to transfer purchased content to my Library? <body> iOS 5.0.1 is out and I want to do any upgrade, but when I click Update, it will pop out a window that says:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iWCHR.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I sync'ed the iPhone 4S once, and it pop out the same dialog.  I sync'ed again and it was the same thing.  Is it not good enough to just sync?  What should be done to "transfer the purchased items to my Library"?    <answer31257> Follow the steps in this Apple support page.
