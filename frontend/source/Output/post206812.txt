My Macbook Pro won't let me open the mail application. How do I fix this? <body> Every time I try to open my mailbox it comes up with the option only for me to quit or quit and rebuild mailboxes. Ive tried both options and neither will change anything.  <comment249345> Are you looking for a clean start - (i.e. all mail is on servers) or how to troubleshoot and find an actionable error? <comment249371> I am not sure what you're asking but i just want to be able to open my mailbox app and access my emails without having to go to gmail.com so i need to figure out what to fix on my computer in order to do so
