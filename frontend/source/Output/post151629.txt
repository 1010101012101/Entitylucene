Yosemite Safari Favicon <body> Anyone know of a way to make Safari show favicons in Yosemite? I was using codeGlims/code under Mavericks but that no longer works.  I tend to have lots of tabs open and sometimes it's easier to find the proper tab by the favicon rather than the text.  <answer157048> Instead of favicons, try zooming out with a trackpad or a mousepad. It will show you previews of all your open tabs.  <answer184508> As of Safari 8, favicons no longer show up on the tab bar, to my disappointment.  One solution is to use SafariStand &amp; EasySIMBL. Once installed (see instructions on the SafariStand site), open the SafariStand settings and check "Show Icon on Tab Bar". This will return favicons to the tabs.  <answer295396> You can't. But a workaround is to use this Safari Extension to add emoji to the tabs instead of favicons. For a lot of popular sites there is an emoji that closely matches the favicon or brand!  <comment180891> FYI I've given up and moved back to chrome.  Safari just can't compete when dealing with a large number of tabs. <comment184682> That's hardly a solution to what pretty much every other browser does.  I'm aware of the feature and it's just way too time consuming for normal tab switching <comment218952> Thanks but I've just given up, as much as I want to like safari I just can't do it. <comment372960> While this might be a valuable answer, there's no need to post it [twice](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/295395/121968). Next time, please [flag](https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/flag-posts) the question as a duplicate. <comment372961> @Glorfindel will do! Thanks for the tip. <comment372964> @Glorfindel, why mark this as a dupe when it was asked before the other? <comment372965> Curious why that extension uses emoji rather than the site's favicon <comment372966> Because that question has a higher score, an upvoted answer and more views (so it's likelier to be found when Googling). See https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/147643/295232 <comment372969> Safari doesn't support favicon in tabs (and many other places), it just displays the page title text. Emoji is just text, so I just change the page title. @dstarh <comment373141> @Glorfindel thanks for the clarification <comment373142> @MattSephton ahh that makes sense.  Still one of the main reasons I don't like safari
