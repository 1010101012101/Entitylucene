App > Get Info > Name & Extension > "Hide extension" option is greyed out <body> codeFinder menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; "Show all filename extensions"/code strongIS/strong checked, and I'd like to keep it that way if at all possible.  But there is one particular app that I'd like to hide the extension of, and can't figure out how.  To feed any curiosities, the app is called "Obscurity", and yes, I've messaged the author &amp; gotten no reply (yet).  Things I've tried that DON'T work...  ol liI have gone about a week working with the Finder Preference mentioned above unchecked, and it just doesn't work for me./li liI have enabled the "root" user, logged in as root, and the option in the Get Info window is emstill/em greyed out (to my surprise) - yes, I've subsequently turned off root./li liI've tried typing this in the Terminal.app (which required downloading some Xcode stuff), but it didn't make any difference (&amp; yes, I relaunched the Finder after each try)...  codesudo SetFile -a E pathToApp/code/li /ol  ...when that didn't work, I tried it the other way around with a lowercase "e" instead of an uppercase "E", but that didn't make any change either.  Any other thoughts/tips/tricks/ideas?
