How can I reproduce this magnification effect for my own screen shots? <body> Does anyone know how to make the great-looking magnifying glass, shown in Apple's image, shown below? I really like the shadow! I'd love to know what software Apple uses for this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JgFFK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer230120> In Preview you can now add shadowed magnification. I think this was new in El Capitain. But it is not the emsame/em shadow. My guess is that effect is produced in Quartz Composer (if they want to "eat their own dog food").

Am I missing something? <comment281267> Thanks, I've started using that until I find the more attractive one Apple uses. <comment281268> I figured out how to save it. Not sure what I was doing wrong, but it works now.
