Why does Google Chrome Helper spike my CPU? <body> This has been happening on and off since I switched to a mac at work. Google Chome Helper occasionally runs my cpu into the red and has the fan spinning madly.  Sometimes restarting Chrome fixes the problem, sometimes not. Eventually it always surfaces again.  <answer138617> The problem, in my case, seems to have been one of the tabs I always have open runs some crazy cpu-intensive plugin for ads (I suspect Grooveshark, but am not positive).  The fix was to go into Chrome settings (codesettings/code  codecontent settings/code  codeplugins/code) and choose codeClick To Play/code.  By default Chrome runs all plugin content as soon as the page is loaded - regardless of what is is, or how much memory it takes.    <answer245477> I found the issue for me was that some plugins needed to be removed (or disabled and enabled) - particular Markdown Here.  There's an ongoing ticket here about this bug, it's got something todo with codeGoogle Offline/code and codeMarkdown Here/code, I disabled both and re-enabled them (in your Chrome Settings  Extensions). This fixed the problem!  h2How to fix High CPU usage Google Chrome Mac/h2  This may be down to this plugin or some other, here are the steps I took to diagnose it.  ol liOpen your strongTask Manager/strong (In Google Chrome  Settings Icon  More Tools  Task Manager)/li liOpen your strongActivity Monitor/strong (Used to view system wide CPU usage)/li liView the CPU in the Chrome Task Manager, if any of the plugins are taking a significant amount of memory.

The idea is to view the chrome task manager and the CPU column to detect exactly what's causing the high memory usage.      If it's a plugin, disabling and re-enabling it may help. If it still continues, probably best to remove the plugin (and file an issue with the plugin vendor if possible).   <comment284089> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/190803/94
