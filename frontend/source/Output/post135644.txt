How to guide on prioritising performance of one application <body> Most Linux based operating systems allow you to increase allocated system resources for a particular application and I am wondering if the UNIX based OSX Mavericks has the same capabilities.  I am running VDMX (a graphically intense, realtime, multilayered video application) and am finding that when loading more complex plugins the performance of the application is bombing.  Is there a way to give that particular application priority when it comes to requesting system resources, specifically RAM and CPU cycles?  <comment160789> What dies Activity Monitor show is taking the cycles and RAM? <comment160792> Well after killing off chrome it appears to be kernel_task at around 2GB, after reading around on some forums it appears that this is a common issue with its consumption rising from about 500MB to 1-4GB after installing Mavericks. <comment160795> So sounds like you need to install more RAM - the kernel task is probably doing things in video etc to support your main program <comment160797> Check out the [renice](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/renice.8.html) manual page
