How to turn off "Your SIM played a tone" message on iPhone 4? <body> Each time when I get the message "Your SIM played a tone" if I don't respond instantly and close the option it gets stuck and my entire iOS 9.3.2  doesn't respond. I have had this issue some ten times. How do I disable this?  <answer107114> To disable the feature do the following:  Open Settings  Phone  SIM Applications then turn off the CallerXChange Service or anything similiar to that.   <answer123881> I have found a fix for this.  Go to strongSettings  Privacy  Location Services/strong, then scroll down for strongSystem Services/strong and turn off strongLocation-Based iAds/strong.  <comment213836> Not working for me on iPhone 5S
