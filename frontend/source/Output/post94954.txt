How to properly register a file extension on mac so it will also work by running open from the command line? <body> I have the following problem, I registered a file extension to be opened by a Mac Application by clicking on the file in Finder and selecting to always use the target application to open the files.  So far it works, BUT it doesn't work with code&gt;open filename.ext/code as it will say:  precodeNo application knows how to open /path/filename.ext. /code/pre  Clearly codeopen/code works differently than Finder.  If possible I would prefer a command line solution.  <answer94955> You can add them to the codeLaunchServices.plist/code file. To do that you open the code.plist/code (I did it in XCode, if you've not got XCode installed there's standalone packages you can get), then you add a new tag entry with the application and extension you want. You'll have a fair few already in there that you can reference.  In theory what you set in Finder should be honoured by Terminal and codeopen/code, but if it's not then it might be something in codeLaunchServices/code not working correctly.  <answer95032> If you selected Always Open With from a context menu, it only changes the default application for the selected items. If you change the default application from an information window, it normally also has an immediate effect on codeopen/code.  If it wasn't that, com.apple.LaunchServices.plist can also be edited as XML:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist /code/pre  Applying changes requires restarting. Logging out and back in isn't enough.  You could also try using duti or RCDefaultApp.  <comment111345> Where is this file located on OS X 10.8? `locate` does not seem to find it. <comment111359> It can be found in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist`, sorry I completely forgot to add that.
