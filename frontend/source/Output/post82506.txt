Cannot change Finder's "New Finder windows open" preference; it's grayed out <body> Why am I not allowed to change any of the preferences in Finder's General preference pane, except for emSpring-loaded folders/em? I am allowed to change any of Finder's Labels, Sidebar, or Advanced preferences, except for emShow all filename extensions/em and emShow warning before emptying the Trash/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zn7ro.png" alt="Finder Preferences"  I've tried deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist then restarting Finder, which recreates com.apple.finder.plist, but the problem persists.  I'm running OS X 10.6.8.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0b51.png" alt="Finder Preferences"  <answer82523> I assume your user are assigned administrator rights on the machine? Have you tried booting up in Safe Mode? Do the problem persist inside there?  To boot in safe mode:  ol liShut down you mac completely./li liPress the power button./li liAfter you hear the startup tone, hold Shift key./li liRelease Shift once you see the gray Apple icon and progress bar./li /ol  Also, try to create a new user. Check if the problem appears on your new user as well.  strongEdit:/strong  strongFound this to be a solution:/strong  Move (dont delete in case something goes wrong) theese four files to your desktop from &lt;~/Library/Preferences and make a full reboot. Not necessary to do safe mode for this operation. Just Cut and paste the files directly.  ul licom.apple.desktop.plist/li licom.apple.desktopservices.plist/li licom.apple.finder.plist/li licom.apple.preference.desktopscreeneffect.plist/li licom.apple.sidebarlists.plist/li /ul  The files should appear after a reboot, and hopefully fix your problem.  <answer83488> I gave in and upgraded to Mountain Lion (10.8), and I no longer experience the issue.  <comment95238> Yup, I'm an administrator. The problem persists after booting in safe mode, and also is present for newly created administrator users.  I moved desktop, finder, preference.desktopscreeneffect, & sidebarlists (desktopservices  didn't exist), but the problem persists. <comment95457> This is quite strange. You are not using any 3rd part sofware like TotalFinder or Forklift for finder? If so I would suggest to reinstall that piece of software. <comment95544> Nope, I'm using plain old Finder. I'm planning to upgrade to Mountain Lion, so I'll do a clean install of OS X 10.8 and (hopefully) report back that all is well. <comment96107> Which four of the files should he move? :)
