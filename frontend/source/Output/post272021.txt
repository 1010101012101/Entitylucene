Apple Watch, keep calendar-details during entire meeting <body> I mostly use the "modules" watch face since I can have my next meeting in the middle. However I noticed now that the current appointment I have will disappear and show the the next appointment before the current one has actually ended. This is a big problem for me since it is very important I always know when my current meeting ends so I can close it in the right time.  See the image below, the "J4" meeting will be removed from the watch face before 10:50. I want it to stay until 10:50 or at least 10:45. Is that possible?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KGGIi.png" alt="watch face"  <answer272034> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r1T7D.jpg" alt="Apple Watch calendar"  Hmm, that's wierd, it's OK for me.  Try these:  ul licheck if WatchOS is latest version/li licheck if your calendar is synced with the end-date in your iPhone / iCloud Calendar./li /ul  For me it works without any hassle.  p.s. This is added through iCloud / iPhone, not a remote calendar, might be that.  <comment341961> You say that the 10:30 to 10:50 meeting was removed before 10:50. When did the meeting after that start, according to your calendar? If it started before 10:50, say at 10:40, it will be the event to be displayed.
