Macbook air recover admin account <body> I wanted to  update my email address associated with my admin account. However now I can't find a way to open my admin account as there is no option. I have a lot of important data associated with this account and can't afford to lose it . Can anyone help me please?   <comment361076> What version of macOS are you running?
