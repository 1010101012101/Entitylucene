Applescript to change subject line <body> I have been looking up for the last two days and found a few applescripts that claimed to change the subject lines. But none of them seem to be able to change/set the subject line. What do you guys think the mistake is here?  precodetell application "Mail"     set theSubjectList to {}     set themessages to selection as list     repeat with msg in themessages         set thisSubject to (subject of msg as string)         if thisSubject is not in theSubjectList then             set theSubjectList to theSubjectList &amp; {thisSubject}         end if     end repeat      set theNewSubject to ¬         (choose from list theSubjectList with prompt ¬             "Choose the subject of the merged thread…") as string      if theNewSubject is in theSubjectList then         repeat with msg in themessages             set subject of msg to (theNewSubject)         end repeat     else         display dialog "Action cancelled"     end if end tell /code/pre  I get the following error  precodeerror "Mail got an error: Can’t set subject of message to \"CHANGED SUBJECT LINE\"." number -10006 from subject of message /code/pre  <answer208701> The simple answer is that "subject" is read-only. Mail's Applescript dictionary shows:  precodesubject (text, r/o) : The subject of the message /code/pre  I would love to be able to combine messages into a thread, but I can't see how to change the subject without perhaps exporting and re-importing messages.  <comment244932> None of the scripts were actually updated for the latest Mac/Mail.app version. Do you people think this function may be deprecated? <comment251741> Yep Charles. I ended up creating a python program to do it. So now the Automator python app can take .eml files as input and change the subject and save back to the same .eml file which I import back to the mailbox.
