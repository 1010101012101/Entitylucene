Can I determine how the Flashback trojan infected my machine despite disabling Java? <body> Apple's update on April 17, 2012 detected and deactivated the Flashback trojan.  Yet two weeks ago I had following the instructions here. After concluding that my Mac is not infected, I disabled Java.  I don't understand how Flashback could have sneaked in, especially after my guard has been up after an Arstechnica article, but that no longer matters.  How do I find out what kind of damage might have already been done? Will one of the log files contain a trace of what has happened?  <answer48861> I'd be surprised if the logs told you anything useful.   If you're concerned, you could install one of the free AV products for the Mac. Do a full system scan to ensure that all traces of the trojan have been removed.  <comment55933> There may have been different version of Flashback than the one in the F-secure instructions. Did you disable Java in all browsers that you were using or in Java Preferences (in Utilities)? <comment55944> Only in the browsers (Safari + Firefox), but I see that Java is also disabled in Java Preferences, which the last Apple patch said would do.
