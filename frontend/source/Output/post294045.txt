Operation still not permitted after unlocking and trying to delete folder <body> I'm running macOS Sierra. I'm trying to uninstall an app. It shows up in Finder as Zero bytes and locked and only admin has Write permissions. When I try to change it via finder it gives me an error.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUblJ.png" alt="Locked and can&#39;t unlock" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EUPBJ.png" alt="You don&#39;t have necessary permissions"  So I went to the terminal and tried the following  precodesudo chflags nouchg CrashPlan.app sudo rm -fdr CrashPlan.app /code/pre  and I get the error  precodeOperation not permitted /code/pre  There is a Contents folder within that folder, but no files. If I tried it on that folder individually I get the same behavior. I've also tried using codesudo chown -R/code on the folder and get the same error. I just ran a permissions repair from the recovery console.   <comment371298> Simplest might be to reinstall it, then uninstall properly - https://support.code42.com/CrashPlan/4/Get_started/Uninstall_the_Code42_app
