Is it possible to delete a customer review that contains wrong information? <body> We have an iPad app in the app store. Someone wrote a review that contains some false information about the app.  What can I do about this? Can I flag the comment so that Apple takes a look at it?  <answer112335> You can't simply delete the review yourself, however you can flag it for review by Apple to be deleted.  Click on strongReport a Concern/strong next to the review on the App Store, then select a reason for your flag, followed by comments:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9AEGS.png" width="288"  <answer167553> As of January 2015, you can in Itunes Connect:  ul liSign in to Itunes Connect/li liGo to "Contact Us"/li liChoose "App Store Questions"/li liChoose "Customer Reviews"/li liChoose "Specific Removal Request"/li liClick on the strongem2nd/em/strong "contact us" link. A form should appear./li liFill in the form and push "Submit"/li liWait for Apple to contact you./li /ul  <comment131856> Let us know what happens if you do that.  Of course, some vendors may think *all* negative reviews are "wrong information". <comment274668> Thanks for the answer! I've successfully used this method a few times when the app store has failed to install the purchased app. In those cases, when the user contacted me, rebooting the system successfully installed the app, and contacting iTunes Connect, helped to remove negative reviews. <comment349964> It seems this method is not valid anymore.
