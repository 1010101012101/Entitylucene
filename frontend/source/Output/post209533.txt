Airplay sounds are withheld and play when I switch back to internal speakers <body> Today I encountered this strange problem:  ul liI tried to switch to my Airplay speakers (connected through an Airport Express) by using alt+click on the sound icon in the menu-bar. Music was playing through the Internal Speakers/li liAfter the switch the music was not routed to the Airplay speakers. Tried increasing/decreasing my volume to hear the "quack" sound for every step. Did not hear that either./li liI switch back to the Internal Speakers and the "quacks" which I should have heard earlier now sound in succession through the Internal Speakers./li /ul  My system:br Macbook Pro 5,3br Mountain Lion 10.8.5br Airport Express, firmware 7.6.4    What steps should I take to diagnose/repair this?
