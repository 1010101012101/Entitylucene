How do I download embedded media such as Flash video in Safari 6? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How to mimic Safari 5 Activity window with Mountain Lion, to save FLV video files?       It used to be in Safari 5 and such I could open the Activity Viewer with kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbdA/kbd, but no longer in Safari 6. How then do I download embedded files such as Flash Video from a website for offline viewing in Safari 6? Is there a Safari Extension (my Google-fu hasn't turned up anything useful on that front)?  <answer72914> Ok, I figured this out last night. Due to a weird flaw in the Inspector, I didn't notice this before.  If you intend to download anything loaded via a plugin you must have the inspector open embefore/em you have the plugin load the resource. This is easiest when the site does not autoload/play a video or music file. ClickToPlugin is particularly helpful in this regard.  ol liEnable the debug menu if you haven't. (Preferences  Advanced)/li liGo to the web page of the resource you want. (e.g. http://www.example.com/kittenvideo.html)/li liPull up the inspector. kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbdA/kbd now pulls up the Inspector./li liNow load the resource you want to download./li liBack to the inspector, look at the list of files. Look for audio, video, etc under the Other folder./li liSelect the resource you want, then look to the right of the window under location and copy the full URL./li liOpen the Download window (kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbdL/kbd)/li liPaste the URL in the Downloads window to download./li /ol  So now there are just a few extra steps, but the paste to the downloads still works as before.  <comment84637> You can open resource for the video (or `videoplayback` in YouTube) from the web inspector. To download it, press ⌥↩ on the location bar.
