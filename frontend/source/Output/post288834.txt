Pages Web Display Document Without UI (iCloud) <body> I created a document in the web version of Pages and shared it publicly, allowing anyone with the link to read.  I tried on other browsers and it works!  However, it's got an ugly ruler, it shows my name, and my e-mail. This is slightly concerning, any ideas how I can change this?  I know with google docs you can change code/edit//code to code/preview/code. Anything like this for pages?
