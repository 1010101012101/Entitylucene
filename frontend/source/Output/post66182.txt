Messages app doesn't receive Adium messages over Jabber/Gtalk <body> On my brand new Mountain Lion setup, the Messages app behaves weirdly with remote Adium clients when using a Google Talk account:  ul liI appear offline in my friends Adium contact list/li liThese Adium-using friends don't get my messages/li liI don't get their messages either/li /ul  However, it works well with other iChat/Messages clients and Gtalk-in-Gmail clients.  Messages also works well with the same account on my other MacBook running Mountain Lion.  I tried removing the Gtalk account, launching the app while pressing the Option key, recreating the Gtalk account, and aslo using the default options, but nothing seems to work.
