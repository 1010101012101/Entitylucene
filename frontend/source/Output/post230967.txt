Homebrew won't link git <body> I am trying to enable autocomplete for git on my mac (currently running El Capitan) but I am having troubles with Homebrew.  So far, I have installed strongbash-completion/strong and added the lines in my strongbash_profile/strong, as seen in this post The problem comes when doing brew install git (although there must be another git installed in my machine sin I have used it).   After reinstalling brew, I get that git is installed but it's not link:  precodeWarning: git-2.7.3 already installed, it's just not linked /code/pre  I try using the command brew link git and I get this:  precodeLinking /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.7.3...  Error: Could not symlink share/git-core/contrib /usr/local/share/git-core is not writable. /code/pre  Have anybody faced this situation before? How can I link git and what's exactly the "linking" problem?  <answer231009> I used strongbrew doctor/strong to see what's was happening..  It seems like there were some broken links.  The solution: I unlinked them, then I was able to run strongbrew link git/strong successfully. And now auto-completion works fine  <comment282044> Please post the output of:  ls -Old /usr/local   The problem might be that SIP (System Integrity Protection) made /usr/local read only... <comment282046> also check with "brew doctor" if it reports any errors.
