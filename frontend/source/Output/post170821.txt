Optimize filesystem for speed over integrity <body> On Linux, I use the codenoatime,nodiratime,nobarrier,data=writeback/code mount optioins in code/etc/fstab/code to trade filesystem safety/consistency/integrity for speed which makes sense for local development.  Is there a way to do something similar or to otherwise make such a trade off for the other OS X developers on my team?  <comment200902> What hardware do the developers use? What storage media? What's the link speed? (You can open System Information and start with Storage and work your way up the chain). Also - what is the current bottleneck in the developer's workflow? <comment200942> @bmike The method I use in the description can be used to make the trade off I describe in the descrption on pretty much any filesystem on pretty much any medium under Linux.  What does link speed have to do with filesystems as in the title of my question?  Also as per the descrpiton, this is a trade off I want to know how to do and not a bottleneck.
