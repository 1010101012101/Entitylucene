How to get the window id with title of every process? <body> I'm using the following simple script:  precodetell application "System Events" to get the title of every window of every process /code/pre  Which works by printing titles of every window.  precodetell application "System Events" to get the id of every window of every process /code/pre  The above script prints codemissing value/code   precode{{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {missing value, missing value}, {}, {missing value}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {missing value, missing value}, {missing value}, {}, {}, {missing value, missing value}, {missing value}, {missing value, missing value}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}} /code/pre  How can I get the window id of every window?  Is it possible to get the window id and window title at a time?  <answer208354> Yes, you can get the window id and window title at the same time:  precodetell application "System Events" to get the {title, id} of every window of every process /code/pre  However, many/most processes are invisible ones, so you'll want to reduce your list:  precodetell application "System Events" to get the {title, id} of every window of (every process whose visible is true) /code/pre  And further, id is not something set in most windows. Perhaps you can say more about what you're trying to accomplish. You can examine the potential window properties with:  precodetell application "System Events" to get the properties of every window of (every process whose visible is true) /code/pre  <comment251317> id value is missing. `{{missing value}, {missing value, missing value}, {missing value, missing value, missing value, missing value}, {missing value}, {missing value, missing value}, {missing value}, {missing value}, {missing value}}` <comment251418> Yes, I already told you. "id" is not a property set for windows in the UI typically. There is not id property. If you say more about what you're trying to accomplish, then maybe we could help further.
