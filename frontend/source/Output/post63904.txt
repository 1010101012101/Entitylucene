Looking for iOS music player which includes all id3 information <body> I have open-ended tags stored in the Grouping field of my (iTunes) mp3 collection. I also have information written in the Comments field. A lot of my music is also BPM'd. How can I search by/sort by/access these fields in iOS? The Music app and the 3rd party apps I've looked at so far don't provide this.  <answer97754> Music Stats provides emsome/em of what you're looking for, I think. It doesn't show all ID3 tags, but it does provide a few of them.  <comment76342> Which 3rd party apps have you looked at already (helps to avoid searching/proposing the wrong ones)? <comment76500> Oh dear, too many to list. Groove and DJay are my biggest disappointments so far. <comment76503> Also looked at Ecoute, Panamp, InstanTunes
