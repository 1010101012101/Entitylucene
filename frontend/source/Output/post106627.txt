Cannot do updates in OSX app store <body> I am at a loss.   I have upgrade to Mavericks and now when i go to my App store i see there are 6 new updates. When i click on Updates (showing Updates 6) i only get a grey bar and it does not show any of updates. I have tried everything. Including reinstalling mavericks. My next choice would to do a total clean install. Is there any way to fix this? I do have screen shots but having trouble uploading them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mPyLi.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o1Dm6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer106632> I've encountered that before, particularly at times when Apple's update servers are under heavy load, as they are now (due to the new OS X release and accompanying software updates). As far as I can tell, it's typically a problem with the indicator itself, rather than updates being missing. I wouldn't worry too much about it, chances are it will fix itself in a few days.
