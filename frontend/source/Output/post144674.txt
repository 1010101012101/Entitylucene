Google-chrome favicons color is wrong <body> I've just upgraded from Mountain Lion to Mavericks. And I see weird things happening to my favicons:  ul liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvWUo.png" alt="original Trello favicon" - this is how original Trello favicon looks./li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOwY.png" alt="Trello favicon on Mavericks" - and this is how it looks for me after upgrade to Mavericks./li /ul  It happened over time, on the first chrome launch icons were normal, then after a couple of hours one icon changed the look, then it came back to normal, and then changed again (i'm afraid to say forever).  It's also happening to another one user I know - all the icons are looking strange for him, like facebook and google translate favicons are orange.  Do you know a source of the problem? Does it have a solution?  Will I never again enjoy blue color of trello favicon?  <comment170436> What does the chromium says ? <comment170441> Thanks for a reminder. I've created [a question about in their discussions](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-discuss/hg0WIGeGEd0)
