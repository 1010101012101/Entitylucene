iPhone 5 + iOS 9.3.4 Got Stuck on an Apple Logo - How to Recover? <body> What can be done to recover the data: images, contacts, pdf documents produced by the app?  ul lithe iPhone 5 + iOS 9.3.4 was working fine until it got stuck in a cycle with an apple logo displayed during start - when it boots, it stops on a logo part  ul liNo updates were installed prior to the above event, and the failure just happened/li liThe phone in a DFU mode let's the iTunes to run the OS update to the latest one (10.02), but this process fails with an error code of 27. Some logs on PC show something along these lines: Code:27 Error:failed to mount filesystems... and before: CreateNewBTree returned -34, ... Disk full error .... ** The volume Data could not be repaired. ... volume type is pure HFS+ .... fsck failed on /dev/disk0s1s2/li liThe update to a prior version (9.3.4 - the one it had before) ends up with a code of 3194 on a PC and TATSU denied image error on a Mac book / a switch to a different "TATSU" did not help - the same error is displayed. The idea was to fix the OS it had, especially if it takes less space and the device might be able to boot with all the data/li liThere are no backups done anywhere - not in a cloud and not in iTunes for a year.../li /ul/li /ul  Thanks  <comment324555> The latest iOS release for your phone is actually 10.1, but did you try a different USB Cable, USB Port? <comment324678> no luck with different cable / port. In all cases, the firmware / OS image gets transferred to a device and the phone starts the installation process which stops ~ 1-2% completion. The logs on a PC show Error Code 27, and the details mentioned above. I may assume that a new 10.* iOS is bigger and the phone is short a number of b/mb of a free space, and I think it would be able to recover to an earlier iOS image as it is smaller! from logs: "BlockFindAll:  16293 blocks free, but need 74230; ignoring for now" -34 ... "Disk full error". How to flash an older image that might be unsigned? Thanks.
