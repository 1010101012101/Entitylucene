How to make the Notification Center menu icon glow, (like Twitter does) when notifications are present? <body> Notification Center is pretty great, however, it's very annoying that I have to click the menubar icon or make a gesture to actually open the notification pane.  How to make the Notification Center menu icon glow, (like Twitter does) when notifications are present, or something similar?  <answer98173> The only solution is jailbreak - which is not advised... In iOS 7 you don't get it either (I'm running the beta) and there is no hidden setting.   <comment71050> Umm...isn't that what the popup/banner notification is for? <comment71051> In earlier developer builds of Mountain Lion, the notification center icon used to glow when there would be "unread" notifications. This is worth looking into, as there might be a hidden setting to turn it on. <comment71065> daviesgeek the problem comes when your eyes are out of screen and the 3 second banner disappear <comment71066> bogdansrc yep that will be perfect <comment78513> @EnforcerW why not change the notification type to from 'banner' to 'alert'? <comment79328> @bogdansrc As you know, Developer Previews include features as well as bugs that often change and get lost before final release. This seems to be one of those cases. <comment79603> oh, that's too bad <comment115253> The question is about Mountain Lion, not iOS... <comment115446> Oops haha - not sure then - there may be a hack out there on the internet
