Why to I need to keep putting in my passwords after my Mac sleeps? <body> I have several email accounts, and I keep having to put in the email passwords, my login details and my system passwords! I think it happens when my Mac has slept - overnight etc? Help!!?  <answer156184> Sounds like a keychain issue.  First port of call is to open 'keychain access' Then in Keychain Access Menu run keychain first aid.  <comment183623> and you did not set it up that way? to ask for password on wake ? <comment183624> No - I checked that in Security settings.I have a few silly things gong wrong suddenly- e.g. my microphone won't work and when I test it the mike feedback is all greyed out. Perhaps I need to re boot my entire system?? <comment183627> maybe, but for now run the disk permissions repair in disk utility app in your utility folder. <comment183749> I think it is fixed - THANK YOU!!! <comment183784> Nope - it is still forgetting them - any other ideas?? <comment183785> you already accepted a answer ? did that not work?
