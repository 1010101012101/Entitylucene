How do I launch an app confined into its own virtual desktop? <body> I am running macOS 10.12 Sierra and I have an app which doesn't behave properly especially with multiple screens. Thus, I want to confine it into its own virtual desktop. The result I'm looking for is similar to what Wine can do for Windows programs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kooha.png" alt="Wine virtual desktop"  (Picture from here)  emHow can I do that?/em  On Linux I could do it by running a separate login session via VNC to my own machine (code127.0.0.1/code) but cannot get this idea to work on macOS. After enabling VNC in the emSystem Preferences/em, the emScreen Sharing/em client says I cannot control my own desktop.  Is there any way I can constrain an app into its own virtual desktop with a single screen and fixed resolution? I'd like to avoid running a virtual machine just for this task.  <comment335888> In what way is what you're looking for different from a virtual machine? <comment335893> @timothymh I'm asking how to merely run a separate login session using the same OS on the same host. At most I may need to run a different display server or just an app that "locks" the window of my app. A VM would require running a totally different instance of the OS, with a separate kernel, separate login account, a separate root file system and different hardware (real vs virtual). I don't see how these things are comparable at all. <comment335894> Ah, sorry, your use of the phrase "virtual desktop" instead of "login session" confused me. <comment335895> @timothymh it is a "desktop" in the sense used also by Wine or VNC, i.e. the app must believe it is placed in a single screen of size e.g. 1024x768 and act accordingly. Thanks for pointing out a possible ambiguity, though.
