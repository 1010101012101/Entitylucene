Trouble updating iPhone 3GS <body> I have a jailbroken iPhone 3gs which runs iOS 4.1 (8B117). Predictably, I can't download most of the apps and so often, I feel like it's not even an smartphone. So I need to update it anyhow.   But everytime I try, I either receive Error 3194 or 3004. I've tried numerous things suggested across various forums like removing the gs.apple.com entry in the hosts file, putting it back, using TinyUmbrella to do the same thing but all in vain. I have the latest iTunes version installed (v.11). I've tried updating by just hitting Update/Restore, by manually downloading the firmware and then doing Shift + Restore. I tried by building a custom firmware from sn0wbreeze. I've even tried from another computer. I've tried updating to multiple versions (5 and 6). But nothing worked. I always receive either error 3194 or 3004.  I really need to update this. I'd be really really grateful for any kind of help.   Thank you very much!  <comment117364> Have you tried restoring it rather than updating it? (Note: this will wipe your device; back it up first). <comment117366> Yes. But that doesn't work either! :(
