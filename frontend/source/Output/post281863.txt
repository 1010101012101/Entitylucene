How make Safari always download CSV files instead of opening them in-page? <body> When you click on a link containing to a CSV file, Safari renders it by default.  Most other browsers will download them in this circumstance and I'd like to make Safari do the same.    What's the setting to make that happen?  <comment354745> Related [question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/24012/121968). <comment354748> Unfortunately, that doesn't always work.  For example, If the site has a download button that has an action on it to generate the file rather than just being a link to the file.  Also, specifically, with CSVs, they download as a .csv.webarchive file and even after renaming them to just csv, they're a bit mangled and not a pure csv. <comment354845> Welcome to Ask Different.
