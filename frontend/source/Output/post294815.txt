Set up an IMAP Administrator user for Server.app mail <body> Is there some way to set up an IMAP Administrator account that can view all IMAP user accounts? This would be used to archive outgoing employee e-mail as per company policy.  Page 38 of this document suggests there's a way to set up an IMAP administrator, but it's for an old version of Server.  http://wedophones.com/Manuals/AppleComputer/Server%20Mail%20Service%20Administration.pdf  And page 394 of this document (for an even older version) has different procedures: https://www.apple.com/jp/server/pdfs/Mac_OS_X_Server_v10.2.pdf  It says to edit /etc/imapd.conf, but that file does not exist on my computer, so I don't know if I just need to create it or if new versions of Server.app don't use imapd.conf.  I am running version 5.3.1 of Server.app on macOS 10.12.6.
