Windows 10 via Bootcamp MBR Partition Error <body> I have had nothing but problems today trying to install Windows 10. Boot Camp Assistant has already created the flash drive for installation and the partition on my hard drive. I restarted and booted into the Windows installer.   The partition created by the BCA gives an error in the Installer saying the selected disk has an MBR partition table, and that on EFI systems, Windows needs to be installed on a GPT disk.  Well, searching on the internet I came across this forum: https://superuser.com/questions/508026/windows-detects-gpt-disk-as-mbr-in-efi-boot . I completed the steps using gdisk in Terminal. Now, when I boot into the Windows Installer, it just sits there, not loading. And eventually, the flash drive goes inactive.  What am I doing wrong? How do I get past the partition error?
