"Open with" Chrome not working <body> Since a few days, when I try to "Open with" Chrome an html file, nothing happens. I have to get into Chrome and "Open File" from the File menu.  Same issue if I drag and drop an html file over Chrome in the Dock.  What could I do to get back this feature?  <comment218153> Would it be fine to set Chrome as default browser, and then just opening it? <comment218154> It is set as default but still won't work. <comment218155> You could open the html file, get info, and select the open with to be chrome <comment218208> yes but still why is it not working as before? Is there some preference I can remove?
