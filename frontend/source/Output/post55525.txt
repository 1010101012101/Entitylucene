Open Facebook URL in Facebook App <body> I know using the codefb://URL/code scheme I can open certain links in the Native Facebook App,   e.g. codefb://page/137947732957611/code will open the Apple Facebook page.  Is there anyway I can open pages without knowing the pageid though, eg so I can just open https://www.facebook.com/Google but within the Facebook App?  <answer120147> h2No it's not possible!/h2  The reason is that the Facebook url scheme needs a unique ID for open a certain page and if you look the screenshot below you can see that the "Google" is Name and Username.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U8zAM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment63763> I assume you've tried "fb://page/Google" and similar? <comment63772> Yes fb://page/104958162837 loads Google as expected and fb://page/google shows an error
