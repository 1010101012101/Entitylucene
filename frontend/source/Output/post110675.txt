Logic X's synths look distorted <body> I'm not sure if this is a legacy thing, or if I'm being stupid, but when I open the ES1/ES2 whatever in Apple Logic X, it shows me something tiny and illegible img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DRQqW.png" alt="horrible synth"  I'm guessing this is just cause Apple decided not to update these, but can someone confirm?  <answer110692> That's what it has always looked like. It hasn't been updated for LPX.  <answer275390> This is due to the View settings in the top right (Zoom). Change to 100% and it should be ok (although  quite small on large screens).  This has been improved on the latest versions of Logic X.  <comment130373> that's sad :-( no retina! <comment130389> You can resize the plugin windows, btw, although since the graphics are bitmaps it becomes blurry. Maybe better than nothing? <comment130464> It's actually even harder to read than when it's tiny, it makes the pixels go all funny. It's a real shame they didn't update it with vector graphics, it makes it so much harder to use!
