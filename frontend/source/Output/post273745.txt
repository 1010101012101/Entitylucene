Spotlight can't find Google Chrome app <body> Why does Spotlight want to search Google for codeChrome/code rather than launch the app Chrome?   For some reason, searching for Chrome in Spotlight yields numerous suggestions (a Google search for "Chrome", the definition of "chrome", the Wikipedia entry for "Google Chrome") but none of them is the Chrome app on my computer—why doesn't the app show up?  hr  strongGIF:/strong  img src="https://i.gyazo.com/fc5b1244f0ec2bb4335fdb84e1b95331.gif" alt="https://gyazo.com/fc5b1244f0ec2bb4335fdb84e1b95331"  strongImage:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BzwO0.png" alt="Spotlight Chrome"  <answer273755> Make sure the "Applications" option is selected in System Preferences  Spotlight  Search Results:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jXoRj.png" alt="enter image description here"  If Google Chrome is installed (and in the Applications folder) pressing kbdCommand⌘/kbd+kbdSpacebar/kbd and typing "chrome" will make Spotlight display the application as the top hit:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pt5iy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer273858> Deleting Spotlight's index of your files and reinitializing it should allow it to find your apps in the Applications folder.  strong1.

And the [just taking a screenshot of the window with a shadow](http://www.uponmyshoulder.com/blog/2010/screenshots-and-os-x-capturing-a-single-window/) is on point. <comment344194> @owlswipe SRS BSNS!!! Windows has their "snipping tool" and "alt prnt scrn" and all, but cmd+shift+3 & 4 are so sublimely superior - especially cmd+shift+4, spacebar. (I just kissed my mac) <comment344195> also the QuickTimePlayer (& iMovie) screen capture with select area is supremely amazing (I also recently discovered the [SoundFlower.kext](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) to MIDI route system audio so QT can grab that too...) and with a little FFMPEG conversion to .gif - it's a whole new world of lolcats! <comment344197> I would fire back with tricks of my own but when I hear FFMPEG I know I've been way outclassed :)) <comment344198> @owlswipe oh nOz - naw, I just know enough to do basic stuff, please do tell - I love mac tricks! <comment344199> mostly I just like ffmpeg cuz its FREE :P <comment344262> Let me know if my answer helps or not! If it doesn't I'd be happy to help more :D. <comment344729> This worked.  Marking as the Answer. <comment344736> @GN. Nice! Happy to help.
