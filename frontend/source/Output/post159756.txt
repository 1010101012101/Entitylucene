How to add a 2nd account to receive imessages <body> My wife and I just bought an iPad and I set it up using my iCloud account info.  Is it possible to have her receive text messages also.  <answer159767> It is possible.  Go to emSettings/em  emMessages/em  emSending and Receiving/em  emAdd e-mail address/em  This works for FaceTime as well:  Go to emSettings/em  emFaceTime/em  emAdd e-mail address/em  However, as Mike and Tetsujin stated above, it is not possible to use multiple iCloud/Apple ID accounts on the iPad ;).  <comment187739> No, the iPad is designed as a one-user device, not as a one-family device. Each user has to have their own iPad, not their own account on a shared iPad. <comment187744> ahhh… I missed that  - one iPad 2 accounts… no, not going to work well. I'd mis-read 2 iPads, one account.
