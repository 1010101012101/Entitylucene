How do you open the "purple sticks" on the right areas in time machine? <body> Well i'm a bit confused. Cause I heard that the purple areas are because its backed up in an external HD. Then why doesn't the purple areas turn white ( white= available i think) when i connect my ext.HD? Shortly, how is it possible to access the purple areas? Thanks in advance..  <comment38146> You mean you can't get into them when your backup drive is connected? <comment38516> See something here ... http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26738/why-are-some-backups-grey-and-others-purple-in-time-machine-in-lion
