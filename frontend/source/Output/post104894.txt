Why do some contacts on the favorites screen on Phone.app show initials and others an icon? <body> In iOS 7 the contacts in my favorites screen in Phone.app that don't have a photo show either initials or a person icon. Why not just one or the other and what determines which image a contact will get?  I think this is best shown with a picture:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HEkHH.png" height="450"  <answer104897> The icon is displaying because that contact's "name" is entered as a business name, and their "First" and "Last" names are blank.  <answer104899> I think I figured out 3 different situations in which an icon instead of initials is displayed  ul liemoji in any of the name fields/li liThe number is a business instead of a person (Thanks Eddie)/li liNo name in the person or business fields of a contact/li /ul  I would think that it would still show initials in the first case if the emoji isn't the first letter in any of the name fields but that isn't the case.
