USB Drive Copy Error <body> I have a USB Drive (formatted as a Read-only CD). On attempting to copy certain files on the drive to my Mac (OS X 10.10.5) I receive the error:      The Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in [file] can’t be read or written.   (Error code -36)   Digging further, I've found that this can be caused by many issues.  My dmesg shows:     USB (XHCI Root Hub USB 2.0 Simulation):Port 1 on bus 0xa connected or   disconnected: portSC(0xe0206e1) USBMSC Identifier (non-unique):   00000000001f4754 0x90c 0x1000 0x1100, 2       SAM Multimedia: READ or WRITE   failed, SENSE_KEY = 0x05, ASC = 0x20, ASCQ = 0x00   Going with that I found that it has something to do with the USB drive not being compatible with OS X (mostly related to using an unsupported DVD drive and/or installing OS X on a PC [which is off-topic and not something I am doing], and possibly something to do with Microsoft's Software Asset Management.  The explanation of that specific code is at the below link:  http://www.t10.org/lists/asc-num.htm#ASC_20  strongAny thoughts of what I can do to be able to copy all files off the drive?/strong  (In case any is wondering, I have legal rights to copy the files/install them on a system, they just aren't explicitly supported to run on OS X).  <comment269127> @user3439894 I received the USB Drive formatted as such. I have been doing more research and I wonder now if it has to do with the fact that it is ISO 9660 (Joliet) <comment269129> Also, I haven't been able to replicate the dmesg, though the error 36 persists. <comment269131> @user3439894 No, but I have tried a supposedly identical USB drive on my system and receive the same error. So it's not an issue with the drive. <comment269132> @user3439894 just tested it on a Windows system. Works fine. <comment269135> @user3439894 I suppose that could work, but I'm really interested how to read it under osx or at least know why I can't <comment269348> @user3439894 This is TrusCont protected USB.
