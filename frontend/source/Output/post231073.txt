How to move an opened file to trash? <body> It's possible to move files to trash via Finder with ⌘⌫. But if i have an opened file (e.g. pdf or txt), is there any way to directly move it to trash without first closing it and finding it in Finder? Any shortcut?  <answer231075> It depends on the app, which has to implement this, not a general OS X keystroke.  In Preview: kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌫/kbd  TextEdit seems to have nothing.  <answer231078> The shortest way: strongRight-click the file icon in the title bar of the document window./strong It will display a drop-down menu of the file's location path. When you choose the folder icon that is directly under the file icon, a Finder window will open with the file already selected (highlighted), and you can directly press kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌫/kbd to trash it.  <comment282129> Do yu mean from the app? If so what app? <comment282131> Yes, from the apps. I meant is there any universal shortcut exists? If no, than: 1. TextEdit app, 2. Preview app, 3. QuickTime app. 4. Pages app. <comment282133> No - it is up to the app to do that - also what happens if it has any files open - which one is trashed? <comment282136> It's a pity. Let's say i have 4 txt file opened with TextEdit. And i want move to trash the one, i'm working with. The same with Preview, if several files are opened, how to move to trash the one, that is on top.
