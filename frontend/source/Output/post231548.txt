Burning an iso image to DVD on a mac aways results in something unreadable <body> I have tried burning the iso file 64-bit Mac (AMD64) desktop image (from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.4/release/) by running  precode$ hdiutil burn ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64+mac.iso /code/pre  It tells me the burn has compeleted successfully, but when I put the DVD back into the computer, it tells me it can't read it. Any advice on what to try?  <comment282753> Have you tried it in a different machine? <comment282754> As in, in another computer? No, I don't have another one <comment282757> Just out of curiosity...if it's not for another computer, why would you be burning it? <comment282758> Can you boot from the DVD even though it can't be read from OS X? <comment282762> @Allan I'm trying to boot from the DVD, that's why. Is this not what I'm supposed to do? <comment282763> @user3439894 nope <comment282768> I am downloading the ISO now so I can see if I can replicate the issue. <comment282769> oh wow, thanks! <comment282780> I have a few questions. Is this for your 2011 Mac Book Pro that took a bath when you spilled water on it? I can not find the file `ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64+mac.iso` at the link you gave. It is my understanding that Ubuntu installation iso files that end in `+mac.iso` are **not** for Mac computers. At least not if you want to do an EFI install, which is what I thought most users choose. I know you are having problems booting from a USB port. Maybe this is your problem. <comment282787> Yes, it's for that Mac Book Pro. I also tried downloading a file without the +mac at the end, but that didn't work either.
