Test website on real iPad on macOS <body> For responsive tests on macOS I'm using Xcode and his simulator, but I found something strange going on on real iPad and I want to test it. Is I possible that I pair my iPad with Mac Mini and test it with Inspect Element like I was testing with the simulator?  <answer274825> ol liOn the iOS device, open strongSettings/strong → strongSafari/strong → strongAdvanced/strong and enable strongWeb Inspector/strong./li liConnect the device to your Mac over USB and open the website in Safari on your iOS device./li liOn your Mac, open strongSafari/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongAdvanced/strong and enable strongShow Develop menu in menu bar/strong./li liChoose strongDevelop/strong → emyour iOS device name/em → emyour Safari window/em to open the web inspector for the iOS device on your Mac./li /ol
