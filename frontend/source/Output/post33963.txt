How can I prevent the App Store from doing automatic update checks or notifications? <body> I don't like the App Store app automatically checking for app updates, or showing me notifications when there are updates for my installed apps.  I prefer to take care of updates when strongI'm ready/strong to update.    How can I prevent the App Store from automatically checking from updates, or from giving me the the little red notification when updates are available?  I've got an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0.1.  <answer33982> Sadly, it seems there is no way to do that.   I checked the AppStore panel in the preference app, and the notification panel. No trace of an option to do that.   Sorry!  <comment38776> This only pops up if you visit the app store. So only go to the app store when you are ready to update apps. <comment38819> @GraemeHutchison - This does happen.  It seems to have changed with the 5.0.1 update.  Without me opening the App Store app, the notification badges appear. <comment40663> There is no way. That functionality is not manageable by the user.
