How to quickly scroll to top of long list in iOS? <body> I've recently hooked my MS Exchange account into Mail.app in iOS, and consequently, the list of email in my inbox is extremely long. iOS has the unfortunate habit of scrolling the mail list to the middle of the list whenever I rotate the iPad, and it takes me a very long time to scroll back up.
