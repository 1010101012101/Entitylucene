OS X El Capitan – "package is not compatible" error <body> The build machine used in my project is strongnot/strong based on OS X El Capitan – it is running strongYosemite/strong.   So far I've never had problems with the generated installer file (code.pkg/code), but on El Capitan, I receive the error code"this package is incompatible with this version of OS X..."/code  ol liWhat could be the reasons of such incompatibility? I've found one thread about using SIP protected locations but it doesn't seem to be my issue./li liIs there any way to verify if my PKG file is compatible with El Capitan without actually having El Capitan installed?/li /ol  <answer214375> In case anyone wonders, on El Capitan installers can't copy files to /usr/bin. That was the reason.   <comment257092> Like any computer support the only way to be sure is have a copy of the OS - using VMs usually is a good way to check without having lots of hardware <comment257102> What tool are you using to build the `pkg`? There are a few formats used for Installer Packages on OS X. Consider updating your tools to build with `productbuild` or `pkgbuild`. <comment257109> productbuild and pkgbuild - those are exactly tools I'm using. <comment309484> So were you copying something there using your pkg ??
