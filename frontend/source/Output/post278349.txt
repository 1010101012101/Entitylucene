CD won't mount or eject, Disk Utility hangs <body> Every few days, my system gets into a state where a CD won't mount or eject. When I run Disk Utility, it hangs at "Loading disks".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/plBHu.png" alt="Disk Utility hangs"  I used diskutil to see that the CD is /dev/disk4. The CD currently in the drive has twelve tracks, so the number of mount points looks correct.  precode/dev/disk4 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:        CD_partition_scheme                        *391.4 MB   disk4    1:                      CD_DA                         32.0 MB    disk4s1    2:                      CD_DA                         39.4 MB    disk4s2    3:                      CD_DA                         29.7 MB    disk4s3    4:                      CD_DA                         24.9 MB    disk4s4    5:                      CD_DA                         40.0 MB    disk4s5    6:                      CD_DA                         39.4 MB    disk4s6    7:                      CD_DA                         36.8 MB    disk4s7    8:                      CD_DA                         25.7 MB    disk4s8    9:                      CD_DA                         31.2 MB    disk4s9   10:                      CD_DA                         32.6 MB    disk4s10   11:                      CD_DA                         35.1 MB    disk4s11   12:                      CD_DA                         24.5 MB    disk4s12 /code/pre  When I try codediskutil eject /dev/disk4/code or codediskutil eject /dev/disk4s1/code I get emVolume timed out while waiting to eject/em.   If I reboot, the CD in the drive is mounted fine.  I'm using a Newer Technology miniStack connected to a late 2015 iMac running OS X 10.11.6.  Is there a way to force the CD to eject to save myself from having to reboot my computer every couple days?
