iPhone 4 would not turn on unless it is plugged in <body> So my phone would only turn on when it's plugged in and I just bought it yesterday so I'm kind of frustrated because I don't know what do about it.   <answer167742> Your battery is mostly likely dead and needs replacing. You have three options:  ol liTake to an AppleStore (expensive - and probably not cost effective as you have bought the phone second hand);/li liPurchase a replacement battery and replace it yourself (Luckily, replacing the battery on the iPhone 4 requires minimal disassembly), or;/li liSend it to a battery replacement service (easily found online, or offered through eBay, and not too pricey)/li /ol  This has happened to me many times (5 or 6 times) and I always go for option three, because I am lazy.  <comment196642> -1 for proofreading the title.  If you just bought it, take it back. <comment196655> Assuming that you actually mean an iPhone 4 then you must have bought it used, and it must be quite old, so the battery is probably shot. <comment196667> and another + for today :), all this for correcting my spelling, thanks!
