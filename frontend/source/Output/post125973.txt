Downloaded items with Chrome always have incomplete icons <body> Whenever I download something with Google Chrome, all icons on the desktop has the unfinished icon.   It does it with all files types.   Is there a way to fix this issue?!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OFrEy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment147474> Does it change after download is completed? <comment147476> @Buscar웃 no this is my issue <comment147477> Next question: Does it apply to all files types (you re showing .pdf) <comment147482> @Buscar웃 yes all files types <comment147494> What happens if you download in the Download folder instead to desktop? <comment147500> This question is lacking some details which might help to find a solution for you: Are only icons of files downloaded via Chrome impacted or other icons as well? Once downloads are completed, can you work with the files as usual (open them etc.) despite the "wrong" icon? Does the icon change after a reboot? Does it happen for all users or only for one?
