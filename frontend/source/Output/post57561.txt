Will downloading Mountain Lion from Mac AppStore resume if I restarted/shut down the computer? <body> I'm about to download OS X Mountain Lion from Mac AppStore, and I wanna know if downloading Mountain Lion will resume if I restarted/shut down the computer?!  Thanks... Muhammad.  <answer57563> I'm not sure if this is done automatically when shutting down, but you can manually pause downloads in the strongpurchases/strong tab:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dyotw.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Mac App Store allows to pause and resume downloads.
