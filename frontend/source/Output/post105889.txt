Samsung SSD 840 speed issue <body> Can any one explain me this ? I re-install codeBlackMagic/code but it ain't change a thing.  I'm running 10.9.3 and there is only one partition on the SSD.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQVzt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  With the terminal :  precodeMBP-Thomas in ~ ○ → dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k of=tstfile count=1024 1024+0 records in 1024+0 records out 1073741824 bytes transferred in 35.587628 secs (30171773 bytes/sec)   MBP-Thomas in ~ ○ → dd if=tstfile  of=/dev/zero  2097152+0 records in 2097152+0 records out 1073741824 bytes transferred in 11.061699 secs (97068437 bytes/sec)   MBP-Thomas in ~ ○ → cd /   MBP-Thomas in / ○ → sudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k of=tstfile count=1024 Password: 1024+0 records in 1024+0 records out 1073741824 bytes transferred in 33.653468 secs (31905830 bytes/sec)   MBP-Thomas in / ○ → dd if=tstfile  of=/dev/zero  2097152+0 records in 2097152+0 records out 1073741824 bytes transferred in 11.582934 secs (92700332 bytes/sec) /code/pre  Which is also pretty bad...

Now it says that writing speed is 27.4MB/s (27379034 bytes/sec) and reading speed is 4.45GB/s (4499797299 bytes/sec)  WTF ?  <answer105896> Try running this command in terminal and let me know about the results  precodetime dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k of=tstfile count=1024 /code/pre  <answer132239> I have also experienced slow performance on an SSD and it was due to other active processes writing to the disk continously.  Have a look at question on superuser on how to monitor OSX disk activity: https://superuser.com/questions/89266/whats-causing-all-the-disk-activity-on-os-x  Basically run this either this command form Terminal:  precodeiotop -C 5 12 /code/pre  or this other:  precodefs_usage /code/pre  To locate any process that is writing to the disk continously.  Another thing to try is booting from a clean install of OSX on an external USB disk, and the benchmark the internal SSD.  I would also determine if the SDD is running the latest Samsung firmware. You can download the latest version from this Samsung support page: http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/samsungssd/downloads.html  Beware that it is recommended to have a backup of the data before attempting to update the firmware.  <comment124485> How much free space is there in the disk? Are you running other tasks when you do the test? <comment124492> `1073741824 bytes transferred in 25.102759 secs (42773857 bytes/sec)` which confirm the blackmagic test <comment124494> @xpereta 1/3 free space, cpu used about 10% during tests <comment124502> Do you have Trim enabled ? Check here http://www.davidalison.com/2013/05/upgraded-your-mac-to-ssd-enable-trim.html <comment124504> Nop, it is disabled <comment124505> Try to enable it and reboot the system. Also check `Link Speed` for SATA category in `System Report` window. Also read here for further info http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20052922-263.html <comment124506> Well it used to be 150MB/s on writing and 250MB/s on reading so it's not coming from the `Link Speed` <comment124511> I asked because I want to see what is your link speed to SSD drive, also when was the last time u have reinstalled/upgraded your OS ? <comment124512> TRIM is now enabled : 10% faster! that's a little step, but better than nothing <comment124513> Im glad I could help, at least with that 10% :) <comment155368> What model MBP is this, and did this specific drive used to work better in this specific laptop? <comment155463> Nothing anormal on `fs_usage`, see edited post for `iotop` <comment155473> Does this happen to be an encrypted disk? <comment155491> @wrossmck no encryption <comment157364> Another thing to try is booting from a clean install of OSX on an external USB disk. <comment157377> Same poor performances. But the system is not slow. It don't understand <comment157390> I'm running an 840 Pro in a late 2009 iMac getting 250MB/s on read/write.  The drive might be a lemon.  If possible, try it in another computer. <comment157450> @Joseph. I'm jealous. I'll try in another one ASAP
