Is it possible to have iPhone messages with drafts visibly marked as such? <body> I recently switched from Android to iOS and am still getting used to the changes in the operating systems.  In Android - or at least in Samsung's flavour of it - if I looked at a list of my text message conversations grouped by contact, any conversation that had a draft in it is clearly marked as such.  Here's an example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JgpPg.png" alt="enter image description here"  I communicate via text a lot, and I found this a handy way of marking whether or not someone was awaiting a response I had yet to send.  I cannot seem to find an equivalent function in iOS. Is there a setting, app or widget that does this?  <answer263211> No, this is not a feature of strongMessages/strong in iOS.  If you started typing a response to someone but didn't send it yet, that text will still be in the text box when you go back to that message.
