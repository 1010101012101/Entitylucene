iMac plus second display: Stickies app lose position in OS 10.10.5 <body> My problem might be related to a similar emstickies-losing-their-position/em question from April 23rd, but the resolution that came up there ("Navigate to ~/Library/Saved Application States/ â€“ Look for com.apple.Stickies.savedState and Trash it") hasn't work for me.  I love the Stickies app, but somewhere since Yosemite the stickie notes, positioned on my second display, move down and finally over to the iMac screen every time I start up the computer.  Drives me nuts, and even my ITist couldn't tame the stickies so far ...
