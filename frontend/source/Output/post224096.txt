Flashing Folder with question mark <body> Was getting this error and figured I had a bad hard drive, so I put a new Samsung SSD in my MacBook Pro 13.   However when I try to install new OS X using internet recovery I can't find the SSD. The SSD should show up if I plug it in correct? Or am I missing a step  Also strongly considering that the SATA cable in my MacBook Pro may need to be replaced  Any help is appreciated!  <comment271726> Please add your precise [Mac model](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/index-macbookpro.html)! e.g. MacBookPro8,2 <comment271731> Where is it not showing up? Are you looking for it in the Installer app, or in Disk Utility, or something else? <comment271764> Im looking in the disk utility, and here's the model: http://www.apple.com/shop/product/FD101LL/A/refurbished-133-inch-macBook-pro-25ghz-dual-core-intel-i5 <comment272179> In that case a bad cable seems like a likely cause. It's also possible there's something wrong with the SATA interface, but the cable's more likely (and easier & cheaper to replace).
