Stop syncing Safari History through iCloud between 1 or more computers or iOS devices <body> If I uncheck the Safari option under iCloud settings either on a Mac or an iOS device will the links stop syncing between devices?  <answer179105> Yes. Links, browsing history, open tabs. Everything should stop syncing on the device you uncheck Safari on.  <comment212247> Thanks That is the answer I was looking for. <comment212248> @Todd glad to help :)
