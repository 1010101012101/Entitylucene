Do I need to enroll in "Apple Developer Program Enrollment" for creating a certificate? <body> I have a website that I am trying to convert to a iOS app using Phonegap. But it requires that I provide ‘certificate (p12) file’ and a ‘provisioning profile’. I  am using a Windows machine and have been following this tutorial. So far I have managed to complete till the second step and created codeios.csr/code file.   The nest step in the tutorial says     Click on “Certificates” in the left hand side, and then “Request”. You will be prompted to upload a .csr file, and then wait for the certificate to be issued.   But I am unable to find any such button, do I require to enroll in for "Apple Developer Program" to get the certificate?   Is there any alternative way? As the website itself is a prototype and since we are currently in the research and development phase, I cannot invest any money in this program now.   <answer266340> There is a long rambling discussion here on this topic but the crux is: yes, to get a Development Certificate without a Mac you need a full developer account.  An alternative is to get your hands on a Mac, from where you can do everything for free up until the point where you need to distribute your app to the App Store.
