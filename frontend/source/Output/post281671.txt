iTunes install error 45075 on Windows 8.1 <body> I've attempted to install iTunes on Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit for the first time. I downloaded the latest codeiTunes64Setup.exe/code from Apple's website, and the install seemingly completes without error.   However, when I run iTunes, I get the error "A required iTunes component is not installed" with error number 45075, and then iTunes closes.  The install process didn't involve any component selection/deselection, so I'm not sure what caused this. Also, this is a clean install of Windows so I don't imagine existing installs are interfering.  I've tried:  ul lirepairing the install/li liuninstall/reinstall/li lithis advice to uninstall all other Apple components (Bonjour, Quicktime, etc), before reinstalling. However, in my case there are no other existing Apple components that might be interfering./li /ul  Any suggestions on a fix?  <answer281672> I found a solution which is a variant on this advice, which suggests extracting the files and installing the components manually in a particular order.  ol liExtract codeiTunes64Setup.exe/code (I used 7-zip)/li liRun codeAppleApplicationSupport64.msi/code/li liRun codeiTunes64.msi/code/li /ol  Success! Now iTunes opens, and stays open.  <comment354438> This may help: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204275
