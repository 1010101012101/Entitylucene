Able to answer—but not make—iPhone calls on Mac <body> h2Background/h2  Among the many promising features of OS X 10.10 grouped under the label "Continuity" is the ability to make and answer iPhone calls from the Mac. The Mac uses the iPhone's connection to the carrier's voice network. I think this technology works over wifi.   h2Problem/h2  I'm able to answer calls, but not make them. The error message I receive on my Mac is, "iPhone calls not available. Your iPhone must use the same iCloud and FaceTime account."   h2What I've done/h2  I've confirmed that both iCloud and FaceTime on my iPhone—as well as iCloud on my Mac—are logged into the same account.   h2Question/h2  What could be causing this issue, and what should I do to fix it?  <answer177740> Try completely logging out of your Apple ID/Account, everywhere (every setting/option where you can do so), on both of your devices.  For example, on iOS, you should try signing out from iCloud, iMessage and FaceTime:  ul liSettings → iClound → Sign Out/li liSettings → Messages → Send &amp; Receive → Apple ID: ... → Sign Out/li liSettings → FaceTime → Apple ID: ... → Sign Out/li /ul  Then try logging back into your Apple ID/Account on them and setting it up again.  Hope this helps :)  -James  <answer219035> All you need to do is turn your firewall off.  I did it and outgoing calls just work as well as incoming.  <comment209776> Try signing out and then back in to iCloud (FaceTime at least) on your computer. <comment210360> While this might work, @jtrag, I'm holding out for a more elegant solution. However, I fear that you've presented the best solution Apple's crazy-making iCloud/AppleID cluster will allow. <comment213853> I have the same problem. Clearly, this is a BUG - the requirements for making and receiving calls are identical, and hence either both should work or neither. There may of course be a workaround for the bug, but hopefully Apple won't drag its feet for too long before fixing it (and hopefully fix it in such a way that we who experience the problem need do nothing and just see the problem go away). <comment213855> If someone has done this and found it working, please post the step-by-step so us lazy folks don't have to do the "try to find every setting that might be relevant" bit. With a list of "tap this, tap that" and the knowledge this was likely to resolve the problem I'd have a go, but this looks like just an idea that maybe possibly might make some difference somehow. <comment262113> I tried this and it helped. I first signed out of iCloud (Settings → iClound → Sign Out). I chose to delete all the data from the phone. Then I signed out from iMessage and FaceTime (Settings → Messages → Send & Receive → Apple ID: ... → Sign Out and Settings → FaceTime → Apple ID: ... → Sign Out). After that I logged in to iCloud, Messages and FaceTime. The difference for me was that now my phone number appeared in Messages and FaceTime, whereas there was only my email before.
