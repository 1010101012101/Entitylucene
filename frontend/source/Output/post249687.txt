Trackpad collapsed on the right side (unusable) and very risen on the left side. Is this fixable? <body> I have a MacBook Pro. After 4-years of use, the right side of the trackpad has completely collapsed. It can no longer be pressed. The left side has risen significantly, but is usable.  Given how a MacBook is built, is it possible to open it up, remove the battery, and maybe tighten some screws (or whatever) to level out the trackpad?  emnotes/embr MacBook Pro (13", mid-2012)br I've already opened it once to upgrade to a (256-gb SSD) and (16-gb RAM).  <answer249693> If the trackpad is lifting out of the casing, then it is likely a battery problem. Usually costs $200 USD to get everything that has been damaged replaced. This includes installation at an Apple Store.   Here is the price breakdown  ul liBattery: $130 USD/li liTrackpad: $50 USD/li /ul  Better get to Apple Store. They will likely warranty the new battery for a year just in case it happens again. Your choice though.  If you feel like taking the risk and doing it yourself, maybe see iFixit.com... I have attached this link for a trackpad replacement, and this link for a battery replacement.  <comment309822> What size MacBook Pro 13" or 15"? What year?
