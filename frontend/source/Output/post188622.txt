Remove expansion triangle in list view in Finder? <body> I personally prefer list view strongwithout/strong the expansion triangle, unlike Finder question: missing expansion triangle in list view  I am able to get it to work by selecting an "arrange by" option, but it does not apply to all folders. How can I apply this as the default? Is there a terminal command or something for it?  <answer188623> Set up the Finder window with your desired settings, then press âŒ˜J and click Use as Defaults.  <comment223447> Thanks! Somehow I didn't see it on the bottom of "show view options"! However, the settings changes randomly as I navigate to other folders, which I guess they were overriding the default? Is there a way to force finder to always use the default?
