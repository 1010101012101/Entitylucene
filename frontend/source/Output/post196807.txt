how to see all files on external hard drive <body> I have 200g of content on my 500g External Hard Drive but according to "get info" 471g of space is being used up, what am I not seeing? (To arrive at 200g I manually added all folder sizes using 'get info') Could it be hidden trash?   <answer196812> You can try either of these commands  precode    sudo ls -l /Volumes/VOLUMENAME /code/pre  or  precode    sudo du -ck /Volumes/VOLUMENAME /code/pre  change VOLUMENAME to the appropriate name.  <answer196817> Yes, it was simply that the trash was not emptied: I have learnt that to remove items from an External Hard Drive I must empty the trash emwhile it is connected/em!  Otherwise the files remain hidden but using space up on the drive.  <comment235176> There are hidden files that you can see in Finder if you type this in Terminal: `defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES`. I might have had the same problem with my USB that there was a hidden folder with things that I deleted ages ago. <comment235186> Did you recently delete things from it?  Your user Trash (~/Trash) might just need to be deleted. <comment235189> Thanks fd0, I am not very computer smart, I put one of those commands into terminal and it said: WARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss or the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your typing when using sudo. Type "man sudo" for more information.  To proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort. <comment235191> Cheers The Bro21, I did try putting that script into terminal and relaunching finder but nothing changed.
