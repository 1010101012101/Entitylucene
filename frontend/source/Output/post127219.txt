My phone numbers in my favorite list now shows no names? <body> Under my "favorites" tab it now only shows phone numbers with no contacts name.  <answer127224> Your account is probably inactive, either because you've turned it off or changed your password. Go to Settings â†’ Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars and tap the account that you use to store your contacts. Make sure the Contacts service is on.  <comment149074> You mabe deactivated your iCloud contacts. Look at your "Contacts" app...its probably empty!
