iOS7 won't trust linux computer <body> iPhone 4S  iOS7  Linux Mint  When I plug my phone into my Linux machine I get the following message "Trust this computer?"  No matter how many times I tap "Trust" the message comes up again.  I do not have this problem on my Win7 machine.  <answer103023> This seems to be a bug in how Ubuntu interacts with the iOS device. Currently this bug is unassigned, so it may take a while to have a fix.  The "Trust the currently connected computer" warning was developed by Apple to alert users of bogus USB chargers that could compromise the device.  <answer104138> the trust system is only stored if you have itunes installed and configured on the host system.  which Sucks.  so if you want to charge off of your work PC that doesnt have itunes, you are going to get prompted every time you try to plug it in.  I wish apple would've just smartened up and given us the 'you must unlock your device before you can access memory' type option that android has.  <answer142938> This is a known iOS7 incompatibility in codelibimobiledevice/code versions 1.1.5 and earlier.  It was reported to the developers and subsequently fixed.  The fix is part of the 1.1.6 release.  I can personally confirm that I saw the same problem under Fedora 20 with codelibimobiledevice/code 1.1.5.  Upgrading to a test build of codelibimobiledevice/code 1.1.6 ought to fix the problem, but actually runs into some other SELinux problems.  So assuming you donâ€™t want to build from sources yourself, you need to convince your preferred Linux distribution to package, test, and ultimately ship codelibimobiledevice/code version 1.1.6 or later.  <comment120638> Can you clarify a couple of things? I'm assuming that the "Trust this computer?" message is being displayed on the iPad. What exactly are you hoping to accomplish? Is your iPad jail broken? <comment121336> This is going to be interesting. New alerts to signify that a live data connection is established - new alerts to alert to non-made for iPhone charging devices. <comment121337> Do you use iTunes on your windows machine or are you connecting to the phone using purely open source / third party drivers? <comment127190> I'm running CrunchBang Linux waldorf on a Lenovo Thinkpad X100e and am trying to "trust" my connection between my Verizon iPhone 5 running iOS 7.0.3 (11B511) using a 100% official iPhone 5, 5c, and 5s Lightning Cable purchased directly from an Apple store (so no it's not a knock off) and no matter how many times I click "trust" it never does... However if I click "Don't Trust" it goes away, which I guess that's better some people have been experiencing. It looks like no one has found an answer yet, but I figured i'd share that I am still unable to fix this issue and in the hopes I might get mo <comment127336> I asked a related question here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107579/do-i-need-itunes-for-my-ios7-iphone-to-be-trusted-by-win-7-machine Can you quote a definitive source that iTunes is required? <comment139523> Here is a solution for linux. I assume the Ubuntu solution would work for Linux Mint. http://askubuntu.com/questions/414490/ubuntu-13-04-13-10-wont-trust-iphone
