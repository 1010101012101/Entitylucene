How do you make a complete backup? <body> On Android, you can use recovery to make a complete NANDROID backup, which when restored, is exactly the way you left the system. What would be the iDevice equivalent of this and how would one go about making one?  <answer134375> iPods and iPhones are backed up using iTunes to a Mac or PC.   "On this iPhone" has options to backup either to iCloud or the device running iTunes.  <comment159096> When I restore the backup, everything will be restored to that point? <comment253797> Yes - otherwise if you have something bad introduced onto the phone, it would still be there if you didn't go back to the time of the backup.
