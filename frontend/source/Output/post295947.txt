How to send macOS logs to syslog (graylog) server from /etc/asl.conf <body> I have recently setup a cool Graylog server for myself which I have various machines now sending their log output to. It's great and is helping me a ton. I want to do the same with macOS. There are outdated instructions on how to do this with syslog on macOS, but I think they don't work because macOS is pivoting to Apple System Log over syslog.  I suspect the necessary entry required to make asl send logs as I desire should be straight-forward. However I've not yet found a working solution.  Any specific suggestions would be great. I'll post back when I find a solution myself.  strong-- Update 1 --/strong I've found that the graylog notes on logging via a line added in /etc/syslog.conf do in fact work, but send the logs via UDP. I tried using both the "@" and "@@" tokens ahead of the destination which I've seen used to distinguish which network protocol is used. I suppose macOS's syslog implementation favours UDP. I'd still like to know how to do this via /etc/asl.conf, so the question stands.
