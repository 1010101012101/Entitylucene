Any software that imitates the OS X's windows behavior for Microsoft Windows? <body> I'm getting used to the way that OS X handles windows and opened programs (dock, mission control, expos√©, one program with multiple windows, virtual desktops, and so on). So I find the Microsoft Windows way of managing windows old and unproductive: is a little overloaded and unproductive in comparison. Is there any software that mimics the OS X's windows behavior for Microsoft Windows?  <comment121299> If you were asking how to make your Mac behave like a windows box, it would be more on topic, but asking how to make  your Windows box behave like a Mac is probably verging on off topic for this site, but perhaps another SE site is more appropriate? <comment121354> I thought the same initially, but in the other situation it will still be a little offtopic. I hope there is someone with knowledge of both worlds in this site. If not, I will move the question.
