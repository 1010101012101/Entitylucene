Microsoft Excel formula or search? <body> I have four Microsoft Excel workbooks (excel spreadsheets). One is a list of strongDonors/strong and the other three are separate campaigns which had click-throughs from an email blast. What I've been asked to do is to find out which click-throughs actually donated to that campaign.  Hope this makes sense. I'd love some help on what to do...be it a macro or formula to tie together two workbooks, or perhaps there's a simpler solution I'm missing.  <answer21276> You can simple reference another workbook with by prefixing your formula with the filename in square brackets:  precode=[donors.xls]Sheet1!A5 /code/pre  and work with that.  If the files are not in the same directory, try to specify the path:  precode=/Users/somewhat/files/[donors.xls]Sheet1!A5 /code/pre  subPS: That works for Excel on Windows. But I hope this works the same way for Office for Mac./sub
