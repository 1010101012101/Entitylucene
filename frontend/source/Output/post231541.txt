I have no Internet access in Terminal! <body> I am using OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 and the ZSH Shell.  Here's what I get when I try to ping any server:  precode‚ùØ ping google.com PING google.com (172.217.16.78): 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 Request timeout for icmp_seq 3 Request timeout for icmp_seq 4 ^C --- google.com ping statistics --- 6 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss /code/pre  I noticed this problem few days ago while using Docker, I wasn't able to access the Internet at all from the Terminal while I have Internet connection in the browser.  <comment282767> It looks like your ping tool 'knows' the remote ip, how is that possible without internet access? <comment282942> I've tried to download something using `curl` and it worked!!! but whenever I try to ping or let Docker download images, nothing works! that's really wired! <comment282946> What does `which ping` say? You need to start debugging. <comment283173> it's `/sbin/ping` !
