RSS app rejected for containing to external mechanism for purchases <body> I recently submitted an app that behaves like a RSS Reader for a specific niche that was rejected for providing access to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions.  The app takes the user with an UIWebView to some websites if they click on the link.  I double-checked with Newsify and Feedly and I was able to access the exact same function as compared to my app. Why did my app get rejected and those apps did not?  <answer190367> h1Request Resubmission/h1  If you feel the app's rejection is wrong, lodge a request for resubmission. Only Apple can address why they decided to reject this app.  App reviews can feel capricious. If you feel this, ask for more information. You can ask Apple for more feedback using a Technical Support Incident or directly through the iTunes Connect contact addresses.  h2Ignore Other Apps/h2  For better or worse, the app must follow the Apple App Store Review Guidelines. It does not matter what other apps do or do not do; they may have been accepted when the guidelines where very different.  <comment226000> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because we can't explain Apple's decision only they can
