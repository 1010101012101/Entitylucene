Disable the iTunes import finished sound <body> Often I'm listening to the songs being imported during the import, using the new tracks in the library. When iTunes completes the import there's an annoying emfinished/em chime that sounds loudly because I'm listening to music.  There doesn't appear to be anything relevant in the prefs dialog. Web searches weren't helpful, and I've looked around in itunes prefs files but nothing looks useful there either.  I'm hoping that there's an undocumented plist pref.  I use iTunes on a Windows 7 machine.  EDIT: @daniel-lawson approach seems to be the only way to solve this.  ul liSearching for filenames beginning with emcomplete/em in the iTunes directory, I found: emC:\Program Files (x86)\iTunes\iTunes.Resources\complete.wav/em/li liIf you might want to reverse this in the future, make a copy of emcomplete.wav/em/li liTruncate/Empty complete.wav somehow./li liNo more emImport Complete/em sound./li /ul  Alternately just delete emcomplete.wav/em. I prefer to keep the filename in the directory; maybe this will prevent a software update from re-creating it.  After looking around a bit more using the filename, I found this issue addressed on forums, and the answer seemed to be: delete the file. Also, someone has written a GUI around this that probably just edits the file: I Hate That iTunes Done Chime!  <answer51745> On iTunes for Mac, the file /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/Resources/complete.aif contains the finished chime; if one were to remove the file, it couldn't play. I don't have access to a Windows computer with iTunes, so I can't say where that file would be, but a similar tactic could work.  <answer269575> I found the answer here, and it worked for me on Windows 10.  Instructions copied just in case the website goes away:  ol liClick codeStart/code then codeControl Panel/code/li liType codesound/code into the search box at the top of the Control Panel and press Enter/li liClick the codeSound/code link from the Control Panel. The Sound properties window launches/li liClick the codeSounds/code tab/li liScroll down the list of available sounds in the codeiTunes/code section. There are two sounds associated with iTunes: codeComplete/code and codePage Load Complete/code/li liClick the iTunes sound that you want to turn off/li liSelect codeNone/code from the drop-down box under codeSounds/code. Click codeApply/code/li liRepeat Steps 6 and 7 for each iTunes sound that you want to turn off/li /ol  <comment59136> I found _C:\Program Files (x86)\iTunes\iTunes.Resources\complete.wav_ and truncated it. This addresses my issue, but I'm concerned about this file being recreated during a software update, and would prefer a prefs solution. If none is forthcoming I'll accept this answer. <comment59138> It is not on the list of known hidden preferences of iTunes. It's hard to prove a negative, but the Secrets database knows about 22 hidden preferences for iTunes 10, and that isn't one of them. <comment59139> http://secrets.blacktree.com/? I'd forgotten about that, thx. <comment342387> This works great, and without the need to edit or remove the files so they're there if you ever change your mind.
