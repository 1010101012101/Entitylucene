How can I reduce the delay when locking the sceen on a MBPr? <body> So with a little research I found that kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdpower/kbd replaces the old kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdeject/kbd on keyboards without eject keys. However I find I have to hold the keys longer for it to work, probably due to the power button having a delay to prevent accidental sleeping/shutdown.  What I'm looking to do is throw caution to the wind and remove that delay so I can simply hit the key combo not hold it, as I'm more likely to lock my station if it's quick than if I have to do it with purpose.  For reasons related to what system hooks get fired I need to use this method of locking the screen, so other methods aren't what I'm looking for.  It looks like I'll be forking on the NoEjectDelay source to make a NoPowerDelay variation if nothing better comes along.  <answer141670> I use LaunchBar which comes with two actions that are instant: Lock Screen and Start Screen Saver (I have a password lock on resume from screen saver so they're more or less equivalent). Both take effect immediately and because LaunchBar is emawesome/em the commands to remember them aren't some four-key, esoteric, multi-key combination I need to burn in to my memory.  I hit Cmd-Space to bring up LaunchBar. I type codeloc/code and I'm on the codeLock Screen/code action. Similarly I can type codesta/code to get to the codeStart Screen Saver/code action. I could, if I wanted, make these actions be the top actions for the single letter codel/code and codes/code if I wanted to mess with LaunchBar training, but this suffices.  They kick in instantly.  If you don't want to shell out for LaunchBar (but I tell you it's worth every penny to barely have to touch your mouse in the course of a work day) you can get similar pop-up and actions from Alfred -- it has a codelock/code shortcut you can type to lock your Mac.  <answer141671> I use a simple app called "Salute".  Hitting Command - Control - Delete allows me to quickly enable screen saver and walk away from my work station.    Its a bit dated (it hasn't been updated recently), but it still works fine with 10.9.4 as I haven't had any trouble with it.    http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/19689/salute  <comment166984> I love simple apps that solve one problem elegantly. Very nice.
