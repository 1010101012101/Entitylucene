Upload pics to iCloud from old iPhone not primary iPhone <body> I purchased an iPhone 5S and it was turned on at time of purchase.  However, I did not completely back up all photos to iCloud from old iPhone 4.  I cannot get the iPhone 4 photos to upload to iCloud in order to put them on new laptop.   Help  <answer158847> Transfer them directly to the laptop, using iPhoto [Mac] or Photo Gallery [Win]
