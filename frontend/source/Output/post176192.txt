Airdrop from 1st gen iPad Mini to MacBookPro <body> I am trying to copy a photo that I just took with my 1st gen iPad mini (with iOS 8.2) onto my late 2011 MacBookPro (with 10.10.2) and I can't seem to use Airdrop. Is this a restriction of the OS or the hardware and is there any way to overcome it?  <answer176193> No. iOS 8 will Airdrop to and receive from a Yosemite Mac. It is more likely that your iPad (Or Mac) is not compatible with the feature. If your iPad is older then a 4th gen, I think, it won't work.   <comment207964> Just as a side note, I've encountered a bug in which supported devices aren't discoverable. I just logged off my apple ID on the device(s) and logged back in to get it working. <comment208125> Interesting. I suppose I haven't used it enough to give thought to that. I have noticed it across iOS devices though. <comment208778> It seems that it is a restriction on the MacBook, because the iPad works with the iPhone 5.
