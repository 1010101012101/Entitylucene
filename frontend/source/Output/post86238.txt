Avoid using command for keyboard shortcuts <body> I work with a disabled person who uses their communication-aid to control their iMac through keyboard and mouse commands.  I'm setting up keyboard shortcuts to launch applications directly using services in Automator, however the communication-aid doesn't have the ability to send the command key.  How can I get OSX to recognise other key combinations? (e.g. ctrl-alt-f to launch FireFox)  <answer86333> This article explains how to customize keyboard shortcuts.  <answer86336> Dragon Naturally Speaking allows you to open applications by speech, not to mention all of the other benefits of working via speech when there are motor-issues to consider.  <comment100192> Dragon listens to speech; the person I'm working is unable to speak. I'm looking for a method that reads tricky paragraphs to him.
