How to install OS X again with no access to a recovery partition? <body> I have a Mac running Fedora with no recovery partition and no access to any computer with Mac OS X. How can I reinstall OS X on this computer?  <answer181183> If the Mac is new enough to support it [roughly late Snow Leopard or Lion as its original OS], Internet Recovery would be the way to go.  Hold kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd R /kbd at the boot chimes to get started.  <comment215438> Tried this and it unfortunately didn't work. It is a Mac Mini 2012, though. <comment215439> 'didn't work' in what way? Without another Mac to build a bootable installer on, it's your only way. <comment215440> After the usual grey background it booted straight into GRUB. <comment215442> Then I'd guess you'll have to wipe the drive first, so the Apple firmware can do its thing. <comment215504> Try holding Alt (Option) at boot and wait a little while. From what I recall, after a minute, you should receive an option for Internet Recovery in the boot menu there.
