Is it possible to change the name of a bluetooth mouse? <body> I bring my MacBook Pro back and forth between home and work. I have a Magic Mouse in both places. I guess because they are both the same model, I have to re-pair the mouse with the computer every time I go back and forth. They have very similar names so I'd like to rename them something like "Work mouse" and "House mouse". So far I haven't found a way. Is it possible?  <answer92092> You can do so in System Preferences. Open the Bluetooth panel, select your Magic Mouse and click the cog wheel at the bottom to select "Rename" from the context menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G06Ls.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181462> With the new update, you may not find the cog wheel, so instead you can go into bluetooth settings and right-click (click with two fingers) the device you wish to rename.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPjSF.png" alt="Screenshot"  It should come up with a context menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9fgk.png" alt="Screenshot"  Select emRename/em, which will open a window where you can rename your mouse to anything you like.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NqvRJ.png" alt="Screenshot"  <comment108086> Thanks. Because of your answer I also discovered the "Add to Favorites" option. Hopefully that will make it so that I don't have to manually re-pair my mice each time I get to work or get home. <comment330900> After the Sierra update, this no longer works. See the other answer for the new solution (right click etc) <comment330901> This is the new correct answer.
