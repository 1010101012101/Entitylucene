Windows key when running windows through virtual box on a mac <body> I am running Windows 7 on a virtual image using virtualbox on my max osx. I need to know what the windows key is on the mac keyboard.  Any tips?  <answer97180> By default the Windows key is mapped to the Command key on an Apple keyboard.  On the Windows 7 Desktop, tap the Command key and see if the Start menu appears.  You can change the mapping of keys in VirtualBox if you don't like the default mapping as well.  <answer111799> By default it's the strongright/strong kbd⌘ (Command)/kbd Key.  The left kbd⌘ (Command)/kbd Key does not work because it is set as the strongHost (Meta) Key/strong in VirtualBox.  And they can be swapped simply by replacing the strongHost Key/strong with the strongright/strong kbd⌘ (Command)/kbd Key, in Preferences  Input  Virtual Machine  strongHost Key Combination/strong.  <answer121672> On Virtualbox 4.3.6, I use kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdEsc/kbd for the kbDWindows/kbd button.  Tested on Windows 7 and 8.1  <comment137130> awesome! that's what I am look for.
