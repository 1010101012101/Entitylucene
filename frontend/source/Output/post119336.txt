mount "nolocks" option ignored on Mavericks 10.9.1? <body> I'm not 100% sure if this is just my misinterpretation of the mount output, or if this is actually an issue.  I'm mounting an nfs share with the following command:  precodemount -t nfs -o nolocks,noowners 10.0.0.1:/vol/shared ~/shared /code/pre  But when I look at the output of codemount/code I see the following:  precode10.0.0.1:/vol/shared on /Users/ryan/shared (nfs, nodev, nosuid, noowners, mounted by ryan) /code/pre  Why isn't nolocks listed in the options?  The reason I need this option enabled is that the server I'm connecting to doesn't have locking enabled, and when I try and use the share I experience extremely slow performance as a result (at least this is the most likely reason).  I'm fairly sure that it isn't mounting the share with locking disabled, because I'm still experiencing the same issue.   <comment139197> What is the output of `mount_nfs`? <comment139198> usage: mount_nfs [-o options] server:/path directory <comment139217> No, I meant if you mount using `mount_nfs` rather than `mount`. <comment139292> Ah. The result is the same.
