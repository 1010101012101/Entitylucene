Set Finder arranging order by kind via Terminal <body> I know I can easily do this via the Finder's toolbar but I'm currently writing a huge shell script that'll set my future Mac up exactly as I want.  So is there any command to do it like the one to set viewing style ?  <answer200693> To set a default view style use:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredViewStyle icnv|Nlsv|clmv|Flwv /code/pre  with:  icnv: Icon Viewbr Nlsv: List Viewbr clmv: Column Viewbr Flwv: Cover Flow View    To enable this immediately (which probably is strongnot/strong relevant for your shell script) you have to kill the Finder with codekillall Finder/code. Some folders might have a different view style set already (via .DS_Store files) while installation. You have to remove those invisible files to adapt your preferred style.  To deal with the group/arrange/sort settings you have to use PlistBuddy strongand/strong defaults. The relevant key/sub-keys are FXPreferredGroupBy and StandardViewSettings and therein IconViewSettings, ExtendedListViewSettings and ListViewSettings.  Examples:  Arrange by application:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredGroupBy Application /code/pre  Possible values for defaults are none, date, name, kind, Date Added, Date Created, Application etc.  Arrange by kind:  precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :StandardViewSettings:IconViewSettings:arrangeBy kind" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist /code/pre  Sort by date added:  precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :StandardViewSettings:ExtendedListViewSettings:sortColumn dateAdded" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist /code/pre  Possible values for PlistBuddy are  none, date, name, kind, dateAdded, dateCreated etc.    Some combinations of those settings (view style, arrange by, sort by) aren't possible or don't make much sense (depending on your OS).  <answer200697> strongEdit :/strong I guess I finally found something by looking at the com.apple.finder.plist file!  From http://www.real-world-systems.com/docs/defaults.txt.html, at "finder" :  precodeFXArrangeGroupViewBy = Name; FXMyDocumentsArrangeGroupViewBy = "Date Last Opened"; /code/pre  I guess it should be something like  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder FXMyDocumentsArrangeGroupViewBy = "Kind" /code/pre  But nothing works.  <comment303244> Nothing works is not a solution. Do write it on correct please.
