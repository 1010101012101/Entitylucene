Blurry display in Windows 10 on VMware Fusion Pro on MacBook Pro Retina <body> I have a 15 inch mid 2015 MacBook Pro Retina with El Captian on it. I recently installed VMware Fusion Pro in that and created a new VM and installed Windows 10 64Bit. The problem I'm having is that the resolution is very bad when I use to this Win 10 in my VM. The texts are blurry.  My Mac's resolution is 2880*1800 (Intel Iris Pro graphics) and i thought if i change my Windows resolution to the same values, it would fix it. But I can't even see that kind of resolution in my Windows display options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZTLYm.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can see the blurriness in the text Identity and Detect. (I tried different resolutions and ended up with the setting 1440*900. I also adjusted the text size to be 125%)  How do I fix my resolution issue so that my Windows 10 is also sharp. Is it a problem where Windows 10 is not capable of supporting Retina displays ?  Here is another screenshot of what I am having. The left side is chrome in my Mac and right side is Chrome in my Windows 10.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F1CQd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer218490> Finally I got this working. The trick was to install VMware Tools in my VM OS (Windows 10). After installing this, I was able to select 2880*1800 resolution.   Much better now :) Some apps are still not sharp (Visual Studio menu items etc.). But I can live with those.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YNPdX.png" alt="enter image description here"   <answer233316> Load and start the virtual machine.  In the menu bar Click 'Virtual Machine' then 'Install VM Tools' or 'Reinstall VM Tools' click install/repair and restart virtual machine. This should work - took me a couple of hours to find the solution.  <answer236835> my solution was to disable the 'Use full resolution for Retina display"  ol liVirtual Machine/li liSettings/li liDisplay/li liUse full resolution for Retina Display (un-check)/li /ol  <answer248657> I already had VMware Tools installed, so when I went to Install, it took me down the "Change" path and I didn't have anything to change.  What worked for me was:  ol liRepair VMware Tools (Windows restart required afterwards)./li liUnchecking "Use Full Screen Resolution for Retina Display" (which I had checked before)./li /ol  Now it looks much better, and it fills the entire screen again.
