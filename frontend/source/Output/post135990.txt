RAM for late 2008 Macbook? <body> I'm looking to upgrade the RAM in my late 2008 Macbook, see the spec below.  A few people have mentioned getting Crucial RAM but I'm unsure of what specific RAM to get and what the limit is. Or if there's better/cheaper options than Crucial.  I'm looking to get the max amount possible I can fit in.  Thanks  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIM13.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer135994> From EveryMac :  RAM-Type = PC3-8500-DDR3 SDRAM @ 1066 Mhz  Supports officially max. 4GB and unofficially max. 6GB, br/ but indeed a total of 8GB on ROM Version MB51.007D.B03 br/ and if running Mac OS X 10.6 or higher.  Apple released an update (including 8GB support) here.br/ Also check for information about it here.  And if you are unsure, which to buy: here are some on amazon.co.uk  <comment161233> have you entered the model in Crucial's memory finder? <comment161235> Ok thanks. So if I bought 4GBx2, it could use a minimum of 4GB and a maximum 8GB of it? My ROM version is different so guessing it wouldn't use the maximum of it... but there's a chance it *could*? <comment161240> @Rob I added a firmware update link in the answer so you can use the full 8GB.
