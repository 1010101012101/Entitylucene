On Pages, inserting a graph from Numbers gives a black line at the bottom <body> Notice the black line at the bottom of the graph. When I add another graph after it (its inline), the line moves to the bottom of the next graph so that there is only ever 1 line.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2KHXr.png" alt=""  <answer227614> Whoops! I figured it out. Its really an underline because the inline text was bold and underline. Select the text, and deselect underline and bold.
