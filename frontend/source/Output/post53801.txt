Managing giant eBook collection with iPad after iTunes update broke compatibility with Calibre? <body> In an effort to upgrade security, a recent iTunes update broke functionality to Calibre - my favorite eBook management tool. Now I am without a way to effectively manage my eBook collection in a organized fashion between my iTunes library and my iPad. I find that although iTunes handles music well, it doesn't manage eBook libraries very well at all.  Here is message board post describing the iTunes security update.  Does anyone know how I can manage my eBook collection so I can keep track of what I have on my iPad and easily sync and manage my hundreds of books?   <answer152108> I had the same issue when iBooks got updated. The way I access Calibre when on my iPad is to put my Calibre library in Dropbox. Then, I can just access ebooks in Dropbox and 'Open Withâ€¦' iBooks, read them, and delete them again. I used to do the same thing but using the CrashPlan app; either would work (it basically depends on what cloud storage system you have the most space with).  It's inelegant, but there's no more elegant way that I can think of.
