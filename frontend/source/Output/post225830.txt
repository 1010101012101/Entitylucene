App is greyed out <body> What does it mean when an app is greyed out like this? It is not compatibility with OS X version because this grey thing just happened suddenly and I used to run this app a short time ago and I haven't updated OS X.  By the way, the app still runs. So there is not really any problem. I am just kind of curious as to why it is greyed out.  I'm running OS X 10.10.1.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G4FyL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer225914> Generally, if something is greyed out, it's unavailable, and a common reason is often that the file is being copied/part downloaded etc.  Scroll over to the right and check the file size of the item, and if the progress bar is present indicating a copy is happening.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K2a9g.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment274248> This is not the case here. The app still runs, and it is not being copied.
