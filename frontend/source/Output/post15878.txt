Transfer files between bootcamp partitions <body> I am using Snow Leopard and Windows 7 with bootcamp. I would like to be able to save some files to my OSX partition from Windows. I would also like to have files (say, photos, source code, etc) that I can manage with both partitions. Is it possible to get the two partitions to "play nice"?  <answer15883> You have a few choices:  NTFS in Mac OS X:  ul liParagon NTFS (US$19.95)/li liTuxera NTFS for Mac (â‚¬25)/li liNTFS-3G (free)/li /ul  HFS+ in Windows:  ul liMacDrive (US$49.99)/li liParagon HFS for Windows (US$19.95)/li /ul  There is a bundle promotion for Paragon NTFS and Paragon HFS for Windows, available here.  <comment17259> macdrive on windows, and ntfs-3G for Mac os x <comment17267> it seems paragon has a [bundle](http://www.cleverbridge.com/80/uurl-duw82qa7bd) which is nearly 2x cheaper than macdrive
