Reducing the size of a black-and-white scanned pdf <body> I have a 352 page pdf that is a scan of a black-and-white text. The file size is 60.9 MB, which seems excessively large too me. (Is it indeed?)  Is there an easy way to convert this file to a more compressed one?  hr  Edit. Here's a little sample:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RATI1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer106951> If it is just text and no images, it is indeed quite large.  There are several ways to compress the PDF file, and one of them is a simple solution with strongPreview.app/strong:  ul liOpen the file in strongPreview.app/strong/li liGo to the strongFile  Export.../strong menu option/li liProvide a name for the file/li liBelow in the strongQuartz Filter:/strong dropdown, choose strongReduce File Size/strong (the default would be "None")/li liClick strongSave/strong/li /ul  If the result is a well compressed file but the readability is negatively impacted, you can try scanning at a much higher DPI and compressing it (to get a better compromise between file size and readability) or use a third party product to do OCR on the file (PDFPen, PDFScanner, VueScan and ABBYY FineReader are just some of the several options available).  <answer106973> 60MB is probably OK for a greyscale scan of 350 pages.  I have some 100pg color scans that clock around 30MB.  If you meant it's actually black and white (and no grey) then it's definitely too big.  Preview is probably a bad tool to try to get the file size down without hurting image quality.  The only tools available will resample the image to a lower resolution.  What I use in a case like this is Acrobat Pro, which will let me convert the compression of the embedded scans to JPEG2000, which can save a lot of space over normal JPEG and retain quality.  <answer170792> A great PDF compressor is Ghostscript (codegs/code), which is native in most Linux distributions and easily installable for Mac OS X and Windows.   Daniel summarizes summarizes it best here, with the key quote being his preferred options:   precodegs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH \     -sOutputFile=foo-compressed.pdf foo.pdf /code/pre  <comment125493> Thanks, I followed your suggestion and indeed it went from 60.9 to 23.1 MB. However, the text became fuzzy, virtually unreadable. :( <comment125494> That's one of the gambles with any image compression. You would have to scan it at a higher DPI and then compress it to get a better compromise between file size and legibility. <comment125496> [VueScan](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/4763/vuescan) has a free demo. Not quite sure how to go about going from pdf to pdf. (Rescanning the paper is a psychological no-no.) <comment125541> Given the limited use I intend to make of it, I find USD 299 a bit steep. :) But thanks for the other information. <comment125546> There's a 30-day trial of Adobe apps, with Acrobat at http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=acrobat_pro&loc=us&promoid=KHXXV .  If you have a short-term need to shrink a few files, this would be a good route. <comment125550> That is one _big_ application. So, I did Save As Other...  Reduced Size PDF  Adobe 10.0.0, (I assume this is what you meant with JPEG2000?) and... waiting... down to 15.9 MB and sharp as before! Great. Many thanks.
