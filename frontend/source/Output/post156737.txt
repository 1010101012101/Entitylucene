Mac mini early 2014: Enter startup manager using a windows (wireless USB) keyboard <body> Cannot enter startup manager or perform any other startup action on my mac mini. I tried installing Windows 10 (Tech Preview) alongside Yosemite. The mac mini automatically starts into Windows, resulting in the following error:  precodeNo bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key /code/pre  My guess is that the keyboard is the problem. I am using a wireless windows keyboard with a USB receiver. I would like to start into Yosemite.  Any thoughts? Do I really need to buy a mac keyboard?   <comment184392> Did it work before you installed Win 10? How did you install Win 10 - BootCamp or some other method. <comment184591> I used Boot Camp. Strange: I was able to reset the PRAM, so my mac mini boots into Yosemite again. But still, startup manager doesn't work, and the windows USB stick created from Boot Camp does not work..
