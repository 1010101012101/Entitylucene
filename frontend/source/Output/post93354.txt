Is my mac book pro suitable for CUDA? <body> After visiting this page:  http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-mac-os-x/  I don't know if my MacBook Pro is suitable for CUDA developement. After strongAbout This Mac/strong I see this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GgqTs.png" alt="enter image description here"  It does not seems to be a graphic card in this list: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus  But I asked several times before buying this machine if it is capable for gpu stuffs. And I can correctly runs program that uses shaders. And, more important, I have installed CUDA driver and toolkit and they doesn't seems to give any error. But If I try to compile manually something with CUDA.. it doesn't work.  <answer93355> Click on the System Report button and navigate to Hardware - Graphics/Displays. If there's a discrete GPU that matches https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus, then you've met the System Requirements for CUDA.  <answer93356> Your model has only the Intel HD 4000, so you can't use CUDA  Full specifications: http://support.apple.com/kb/sp649  <answer108944> About dialog displays only  the primary built-in device not the discrete, accelerated GPU. To be sure, run:  precodesystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType /code/pre  in the terminal.  On my mac, the About dialog shows only on-chip Intel device, but the above command reveals the detail, also telling me that my Mac is equipped with the AMD Radeon HD 6750M which is OpenCL 1.1 capable. My mac is year older then yours.   All MBP devices have two cards.

I had purchased the more expensive model with the Nvidia graphics card for this specific purpose. See Macbook Pro as a CUDA dev (not deployment) platform? for details:     strongConclusions/strong      The Nvidia GT 750M card on the 15‚Äù Macbook pro Retina running Mac OS X 10.9.5 is not a great CUDA development/proofing platform if the user is interested mainly in double precision, floating point operations. This finding is in direct contrast to claims such as http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2012/06/14/new-macbook-pros-make-for-great-cuda-dev-platforms/   <answer289160> CUDA is only available on nVidia GPUs.  <comment109507> is there any possibility to change the graphic card or not? <comment109508> sorry but is not possible <comment109512> You can run CUDA in software mode, so that the code will be executed by your i5 CPU. This will not be very fast, but it might be enough to learn your first steps with CUDA. But note that the CPU behaves a little bit different from the GPU. So getting another machine with an NVIDIA GPU will be a good idea. <comment109513> !! how can i do this?? please send me some link for emulating cuda with the CPU <comment109631> Oh, I just noticed that the device emulation mode seems to be deprecated in recent CUDA versions. Back in CUDA 3 this used to work. Sorry for getting your hopes up. The alternative seems to be gpuocelot, but that's Linux only so far. Sorry... <comment129879> very nice answer thanks. and.. yes, only intel is showed <comment365256> This answer adds nothing that hasn't already been said - in far greater detail.
