rEFInd Linux Kernel Boot Options <body> When booting opensuse via rEFInd, the kernel options are wrong (the root device name is incorrect).  Where do the kernel arguments that rEFInd is using come from, and how do I modify them? The line I'm looking for is of the form  precodero root=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-APPLE_SSD_SM768E_S119NYAC612 initrd=boot\initrd-3.7.xxx-default /code/pre  The coderoot/code argument should be  precodeata-APPLE_SSD_SM768E_S119NYAC612130-part7 /code/pre  as that is where the SUSE root partition is. If I edit the boot options from the rEFInd menu (higlight the SUSE entry, hit F2, hit F2 again on the default entry) and modify the options to include the code130-part7/code suffix, everything works fine. If not, Linux asks me:     Could not find /dev/disk/by-id/ata-APPLE_SSD_SM768E_S119NYAC612.br   Want me to fall back to   /dev/disk/by-id/ata-APPLE_SSD_SM768E_S119NYAC612130-part7? (Y/n)   I'd happily hit "Y" here and move on but, unfortunately, the keyboard doesn't work at this stage in the boot process. If I attach a USB keyboard, it works, but I really don't want to carry one around with me. (Perhaps there is a market for a one-key USB keyboard that can be programmed for these things. Dear God...)  So, I am left changing the options via the rEFInd menu every time I boot Linux.  I'd thought about adding a symlink directing code...612/code to code...612130-part7/code, but the links in code/dev/disk/by-id//code are stored in tempfs (ie, not persistent). Also, that is a crappy solution.  Help?!  <comment125009> I am running Bootcamp with Lion 10.8 and rEFit with 10.7, however I also have a rEFit box with 10.6 on it.  Happy to play with rEFind and SuSE to help you out, just need to know what versions of everything you are running?  So: version of Mac OS X, version of rEFind, and version of SuSE? <comment125020> @Deesbek suse 12.3 x64, ML 10.8.6, not sure about the refind rev but I downloaded it about a week ago for a rebuild. Thanks for your help. This is on a mod-2012 MBP Retina, 16GB,  768SSD yada yada.
