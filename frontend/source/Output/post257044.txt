iPod Shuffle 4G wont turn on nor charge, also an error in itunes after factory resetting <body> My iPod shuffle 4G haven't working after factory reset, because I tried to put some music on it before and it says to factory reset it first. After factory reset the ipod shuffle wont turn on nor charge, and every time I plug it on my PC the itunes always detected it but not identified.
