Macbook Snow Leopard Unzipped file <body> I used Terminal command to unzip an audio file downloaded from a public library.  Command used: codeunzip -v /&lt;zip filename.zip&gt;; rm -rf _MACOSX/code.  Terminal displayed 31 files were extracted and stored. I used both Search in Finder and Go to Folder to find the files and only 1 pdf file was found.  The other 30 files, all mp3, went missing.  I noticed that the more than 1gb of disk space was gone.  So I assume the files are residing somewhere.  Could anyone please help.  Many thanks!  <answer239435> The unix command to search for files is codefind/code.  You can use the command codeman find/code to get more information. The usual form is the following.  precodefind  &lt;starting folder&gt;  -name  &lt;file name&gt;  -print /code/pre  For example, if you are looking for all codemp3/code files in the current folder and all nested folders, use the following command.  precodefind  .  -name  "*.mp3"  -print /code/pre  Sometimes you can get a lot of "permission denied" or other meaningless error messages. If so, then you can remove strongemall/em/strong error messages by appending a code2&gt;/dev/null/code to the end of the command. See the example below.  precodefind  .  -name  "*.mp3"  -print  2&gt;/dev/null /code/pre  <comment293841> Try executing the command *without* the `; rm -rf _MACOSX` and see if that helps. <comment293999> You can view the files inside the archive with- `unzip -l filename.zip`. That should give you an indication of where the files are. They should be in the directory in which you uncompressed the archive.
