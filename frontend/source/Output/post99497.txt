How can I find out what software I've bought in the App Store? <body> I'm Using my iPhone 3G and haven't backup it as frequently as I should and would like to know what software I've bought for it. So I know I don't have to pay for it again. Yes I can try and buy the software but I want to know of all the apps I've bought.   I know some apps wont be available for my old iPhone but they will work if I buy a new one. I need to know how much money I will lose in Apps I can't use anymore. If I buy a new phone that isn't an iPhone.   So How can I find out what Apps I've bought for my iPhone.  I have both Windows and Mac computers available.   The mac computer runs Mac os X 10.6.8, the iPhone 3G runs iOS 4.1.2  <answer99501> h2On iPhone/h2  ol liOpen the App Store on your device./li liMake sure you are signed in  the same Apple ID used for the original purchase.  /li liTap Updates from the bottom navigation bar.  /li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BG2KK.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="4" liTap on Purchased on navigation bar/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVbjZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="5" liTap Purchased on the resulting screen./li liLocate the app in your Purchased tab.

I don't have an iCloud account. the amount of apps there is a total of 14. I've had my iPhone since late 2008 and I've downloaded far more than 14 apps. So this answer doesn't work. <comment117056> Are you logged into the same account that you bought the apps with on your iPhone 3G? <comment117057> Yes of course...
