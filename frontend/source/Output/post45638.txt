Use in-app for trial? <body> I was wondering if I could offer (paid) trials of my App in the Mac Appstore using in-app purchase?  So I have a $49 value Mac app, but I allow downloading for free, the app needs a $1.99 in-app purchase to activate the trial for a month.   Do you think it would work. Would Apple allow it?  <answer45640>    Apps that are “beta”, “demo”, “trial”, or “test” versions will be rejected      Apps that unlock or enable additional features or functionality with mechanisms other than the App Store will be rejected, except in cases where the application hosts plug-ins or extensions      Apps containing “rental” content or services that expire after a limited time will be rejected   Doesn't seem like it's allowed.  strongSource:/strong App Store Review Guidelines for iOS apps (login required)  <answer45649> You are not allowed to have trial anything on the app store. Your free app needs to be fully functional.  You can do paid subscriptions in a free app however.
