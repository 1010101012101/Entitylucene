Change Security & Privacy setting from terminal <body> I need to enable the "Require an administrator password to access locked preferences" on about a dozen Macs. I would like to do it from ARD as a unix command. Is this possible?  <answer102070> Using AppleScript :  precodetell application "System Events"     tell security preferences     set properties to {require password to unlock:true}     end tell end tell /code/pre  You can call the Applescript code using the codeosascript/code command.
