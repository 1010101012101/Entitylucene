Accessing Mac from Windows machine using Remote Desktop Connection? <body> Is it possible for multiple Windows users to access multiple accounts on Mac?   I want multiple users to login with multiple user accounts on same Mac and access the desktop independently without interrupting each other. If yes how can we achieve this?
