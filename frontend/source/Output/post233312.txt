Adding GREPs to TextEdit <body> I was wondering if it is possible to augment TextEdit to have GREP like features (auto style words from a reference list), or at least if a script can be run that would periodically find/replace the words to style.  <comment285171> You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately.
