What is the sensitivity of the iPhone 6 main camera in Infrared? <body> Is there a spectral response curve of the main (rear) camera for iPhone 6?  I need to know its relative sensitivity at 850nm vs. visible light. i.e., is it roughly 1/100th? 1/1000th? 1e-5? There is a similar question on iPhone 4, but the hardware now is significantly changed in terms of camera at least in visible light and sensitivity.  <comment340794> It's helpful if you post a link to the original question so we don't have to go hunting for it for reference. <comment340795> That was the only meaningful answer/comment. <comment340897> Then please add a link to the original :-) <comment341019> Original question I was referring to: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/171281/till-what-wavelength-of-infrared-iphone-6-can-filter?rq=1 This was the only reference I could find here related to IR bandwidth of the camera...
