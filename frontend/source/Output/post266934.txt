Linux host cannot get IPv6 address from Airport Extreme <body> I have my Airport Extreme set up with a Hurricane Electric IPv6 tunnel. I am 100% certain the tunnel is working, because my iPhone gets an IPv6 address that is on the tunnel-assigned range, and it passes the IPv6 connectivity tests (such as test-ipv6.com).  But, my Arch Linux PC host cannot get an IPv6 address from the router. Here are the relevant messages from dhcpcd:  precodedhcpcd[929]: enp4s0: soliciting a DHCPv6 lease  dhcpcd[929]: enp4s0: soliciting an IPv6 router  dhcpcd[929]: enp4s0: no IPv6 Routers available  systemd[1]: dhcpcd@enp4s0.service: Control process exited, code=exited status=1 /code/pre  Is there anything else I need to configure on the Airport Extreme so the Linux host can see it as an IPv6 router?  Thanks  <comment334821> Is your Airport Extreme firmware up to date? <comment334932> I think it is, but I will check. Thanks.
