What do I type to produce the command symbol (⌘) in Mac OS X? <body> What combination of keys do I press to produce the command symbol (⌘) on Mac OS X?  (I copied the above symbol from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key.)  <answer4077> If you're just looking for the Unicode versions of Mac OS X keys, you can use this site to copy and paste them from the text box.  More generally, Mac OS X provides a pane to insert special characters. You'll typically find it under Edit - Special Characters in any program that takes text input. The Command key symbol can be found under Symbols - Technical Symbols. To insert the character, select it and click "Insert".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ISizi.png" alt="alt text"  hr  If you're emreally/em hardcore and are looking for a way to type the character by entering the Unicode hex code, this is possible:  ol liGo into System Preferences - Language &amp; Text - Input Sources and check "Unicode Hex Input"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XRNzi.png" alt=""  2.&nbsp;From the input source selector in the menu bar, select "Unicode Hex Input"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R0kCG.png" alt="alt text"  3.&nbsp;To enter a Unicode character, hold down kbdoption/kbd and type the 4-digit hex code for the character and it will be inserted. In this case, it would be kbdoption/kbd+kbd2/kbdkbd3/kbdkbd1/kbdkbd8/kbd.  <answer84825> I also found it hard to find a straight answer for this, so I just went into System Preferences  Keyboard  Text and created a use symbol and text substitution option where when I type (cmd) it replaces it with the command symbol.  <answer94647> If you have TextExpander, one can also make a snippet for it, ala Dr. Drang.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DcS6d.png" alt="Abbreviation for typing ⌘"  He also has a Keyboard Library with snippets for a host of keyboard symbols available.  <answer118599> With the document open, place the cursor where you want the symbol, Open the Character Viewer as described above. Type "Place of Interest" in the character viewer search field. It shows up on at the bottom of the window. Double click it and it shows up where you placed your cursor. Save it to your favorites in the Character Viewer window to make it easier to find next time. This under OS 10.9.1 "Mavericks"  <answer140593> An updated answer for Lion and above:  You can also type code^ ⌘ &lt;space&gt;/code to bring up the characters menu, then start typing to search, and search for codeplace of interest/code, then press enter to start selecting them, then tab to the correct result, then enter again to insert it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cpRPz.png" alt="select ico mac"  Sounds like a lot, but it can really be narrowed down to code^ ⌘ &lt;space&gt; pla &lt;enter&gt;&lt;enter&gt;/code  <answer142800> For what it's worth (on OSX and maybe Windows): In Libre Offices's Writer I found the symbol as the 5th entry in both the LiHei Pro and LiSong fonts.   <answer142819> You can also add Your favourite characters to "press and hold" key behaviour.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6nLAG.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's explanation how to do it on apple stackexchange: How to add characters to the press and hold character picker in OS X Lion?   Keep in mind that this is done inside codeSystem/code directory, so be careful and remember that there's a chance of losing Your setup after upgrading the OS.  <answer177788> This is the simple way on how to do it.  ol liDownload BetterTouchTool/li liOpen the application/li liSelect 'keyboard'/li liClick Add New Shortcut/li liSet keyboard shortcut to 'kbdOption/kbd+kbdC/kbd'/li liSet trigger predefined action to 'Paste predefined text'/li liCopy '⌘' into the box./li liClick Ok/li /ol  Now whenever BetterTouchTool is open all you have to do is press 'kbdOption/kbd+kbdC/kbd' and it automatically types the '⌘' symbol.  You only have to do steps one to eight once.  <answer177792> I normally use "SHIFT + ALT + K" to generate a  Symbol.  Instead of using a ⌘ Symbol whenever writing anything which requires keystrokes / shortcuts because for most of the time that I have been using apple computers it was called the "apple key" . (and the symbol physically written on the key was a  and not a ⌘ )   <answer234860> For future reference, you can copy and paste from here:  precode⌃  &lt;- Control ⌥  &lt;- Option aka alt ⌘  &lt;- Command /code/pre  These are rendered like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JOiRz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer273840> If you writing out keyboard shortcuts for Mac users, I'd recommend using the Apple Style Guide (https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/) way of doing this so whatever you write is consistent with other Apple documentation. In this case you would type out codeCommand/code rather then use the ⌘ symbol. So, for example Paste would be:  precodeCommand-V /code/pre  Alternately you could use Key Graphics.  kbdcommand/kbd+kbdV/kbd  The thing is if you are typing it out always use codeCommand/code.  <answer293480> The Mac strongCharacters/strong popup is definitely the straightforward solution if you need to insert some chacters once in a while. But if you regularly need to use Unicode characters which are not present on your keyboard then a radical solution would be creating your own keyboard layout with Ukelele that will map those characters to your physical keys.  The app is only used the create an OSX compliant layout file (XML or bundle) which can then be added via emPreferences/em  emKeyboard/em  emInput Sources/em  kbd＋/kbd.  With Ukelele you can clone your existing standard keyboard (strongemFile  New from current input source/em/strong), and remap any of the keys to your liking.  In the default keyboard layout holding the strongOption/strong key kbd⌥/kbd in combination with any letter/symbol key will insert extended math characters which normally are never used, e.g. codeœ∑´®†¥¨ˆøπ“‘«æ…¬˚∆˙©ƒ∂ßåΩ≈ç√∫˜µ≤≥÷¿˘¯Â˜ı◊Ç˛¸ÅÍÎÏ˝ÓÔÒÚÆ»’”∏Øˆ¨Áˇ‰„„/code. Holding down Shift+Option will give you yet another set of special characters.  With Ukelele you can remap strongOption+key/strong and strongShift+Option+key/strong to anything you like including Unicode emoji characters.  Here is an example of assigning kbd⌘/kbd to the strongOption+c/strong combination:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3wtY.png" alt="Ukelele remap keys"  You can pick the required character for mapping using the built-in emCharacters/em app as explained in other answers.     subNote: If you have a non-US keyboard (i.e. non-ANSI) you might need to set the correct type under strongView  Keyboard Type/strong  strongCoding/strong: emISO/em /sub    While this might be overkill for a single character, it actually makes sense when you want to tweak other things on your keyboard and have complete control.  Once you have created your custom layout you can use it on any number of macs by simply copying it to code~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/code and adding it in emPreferences/em without the need to use any third party apps. The layout can be installed directly from Ukelele via the strongFile/strong  strongInstall/strong option. Once installed you still need to add it manually via strongPreferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong.  subDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with the app author. I simply found the app very useful in solving some issues with my keyboard which had some keys in the 'wrong' place./sub  <comment5244> Wow, I was sure that would be some option-key way to type a `⌘`. But there isn't!  I just looked through every possible variation of the keyboard viewer and it's just... not... there! <comment88788> starting with Lion, to see the Technical Symbols in the Special Characters window you'll need to click into Settings to "Customize List..." and add it to your view. <comment131520> If you like to add it to your non Unicode HTML-sources, you can use the following HTML-Command: &#8984; . http://fenon.de/apple-befehlstaste-%E2%8C%98-in-blog-artikeln-verwenden/ <comment152029> This is the best solution, in my opinion. <comment167795> In Mavericks at least, this is under `System Preferences  Keyboard  Text`. <comment167796> IMHO this is the best answer, as it can be done entirely with keyboard and doesn't require any special setup. `^-⌘-space, p, l, enterenter`. Once you've used it once, you don't even need to type the `pl` next time. <comment208521> fyi, link is to website with: `This domain name expired on Mar 07 2015 06:03PM ` <comment213517> Out of curiosity, if you need to find the name and hex code of *that special character you don't know what to call it*, try [Shapecatcher](http://shapecatcher.com/). <comment213550> Cool! I drew a "command symbol" (rather poorly) on http://shapecatcher.com/ and it found it with the name "Place of interest sign". <comment213556> Thanks @GraehamF, I've updated to an archived copied.  Still works! <comment226631> On OS X 10.8.5 here the shortcut seems to be ⌘⌥T, but I can't find where that's defined. `^-⌘-space` doesn't do anything for me. <comment230846> Great solution.  Substitution characters [here](http://ipadhelp.com/everything-else/mac-keyboard-symbols-for-apple-computers/).  The characters shown can be copied and pasted for each substitution. <comment244934> Love this solution. just copy and paste this ... ⌘ into the "With" column. <comment248489> seems that easiest way is just google this question and copy-paste the symbol from title <comment253821> This feature seems to be gone in OS X 10.10 <comment269816> @Will indeed, cannot find it any more <comment284878> In El Capitan, select "Other" in the Language list and then select "Unicode Hex Input" <comment320047> @Ken is correct - the feature seems to have moved to this location since the question was originally answered.  His comment worked for me in OS X Sierra as well. <comment329984> This works for me. <comment356235> On newer systems. Open viewer, open the setting dropdown on top  Customize List...  (scroll down)  Check Technical Symbols. <comment356485> @bauerMusic, what do u mean by newer systems please? I'm using Mac OS X 10.12.4. Also, please elaborate more on what you're talking about. <comment356486> `^-⌘-space` is not working for me on OSX 10.12.4. I get the popup with the symbols. but when i click on them, nothing is displayed in any Text editor. I also tried to enter `p, l` first but nothing happened. <comment356487> Is there anything else i need to do for this to work please? I went to Keyboard  Text, added cmd and ⌘, went to a text editor, I typed cmd followed by the Enter key, but the cmd did not magically turn into the ⌘ symbol. I'm using OSX 10.12.4. <comment356618> @nyxee On OSX (macOS) 10.12.4, these symbols are not there by default. One needs to open the viewer, then open the settings (the littler wheal on top left) Customize List...  (scroll down)  Check Technical Symbols. I was not allowed to post images here, sorry.. <comment370330> This should definitely be the accepted answer. Btw, the icon in the top right corner can be clicked to get an expanded version of the popup, which will display character groups and the unicode name of the selected character. Keep in mind that you can add the characters you use often to the _Favorites_ group so that the next time you can access them faster.
