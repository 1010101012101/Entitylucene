Do not hide number when calling friends? <body> A friend has an iPhone 4 or 5 running iOS 7, and has configured her phone to always hide her number when making calls, as a safety measure.  As a result, I can't tell it's her calling, since all her calls says "Private number".  Is it possible to configure an iPhone to hide its number for all out calls emexcept/em for such and such person in the phone's list of contacts?  <answer205410> No, but you could ask Apple to do that feature for you/us in the future at http://apple.com/feedback  In the mean time, have her send you an iMessage before calling so you know to answer.  <answer205455> Possibly.  Your mileage may vary, as this is a carrier dependent function.  I was however able to achieve the following using two AT&amp;T phones in the U.S.  First I opened Settings  Phone  Show my Caller ID and turned the switch off.  Next I placed a test call to the second phone, the other phone correctly displayed "no caller id".   (Note: it does NOT matter who the carrier is for the second phone, all the magic relates to what the first phones carrier offers.)  Next I google "AT&amp;T star codes" and located this list.  *82 looked like the best choice.  I then modified the contact for the second phone, adding *82 before the phone number.  Calling that contact then allowed my caller id info to be displayed on the second phone, while still being blocked for others.  It's my understanding that *82 is reasonably standard for the code itself in the U.S.  I have no idea which carriers support it however (other than AT&amp;T where I did test).  I also have no idea what carriers in other countries might use, or if it's supported with a star code.  Consult Google for "(carrier name) star codes" or check with the carrier.  <comment247684> Why can't you just answer the phone? <comment247727> @user3439894 personally I don't answer blocked calls either, 99.99% are spam. <comment247903> That's why. I got better things to do. <comment247904> Thanks. I'll ask whether her carrier here in Europe supports that feature. Too bad Apple doesn't support it in its OS. <comment247907> Apple could add to support such a feature for a better user experience, but the underlying technology has to be provided at the carrier level.  It's beyond what Apple alone can provide. <comment247913> Her carrier doesn't suppor the *82 code.  And prepending #31# manually before each occasional call she wants to make anonymouslyâ€¦ is a bit cumbersome :-/ <comment247920> You might check [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID) Wikipedia article that lists unblock codes in a list of countries..
