How do you test network speed without an app? <body> The usual Internet speed test is written in Flash. Is there an HTML one that works with iPad and iPhone?  <answer25991> ISPGeeks.com has a non-flash java based bandwidth tester. It pretty accurately measured the speed of my iPad on my home connection, as compared to similar tests on the usual Flash-based sites.  <answer26016> SpeedTest.net has an iPad/iPhone/iPod app.  <answer34228> Try http://speedof.me  It use stronghtml5/strong and works without flash.  You can also see your bandwidth graph which is interesting.  <answer96309> dslreports.com is my go-to resource for carrier/network info and diagnostics. Free membership, no spam, genuine user generated content, reviews, and support all are part.  The "tools" section is very robust.  <comment29591> It worked: http://www.ispgeeks.com/wild/modules.php?name=Bandwidth_Meter_DSL . Click go. <comment29820> There is an app for that ;)
