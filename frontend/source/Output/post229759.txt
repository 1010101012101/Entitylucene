Lock Dock To 1 Screen <body> I'm using 2 screens and I keep hitting the bottom of the second screen and the dock jumps to that screen. The problem is it doesn't jump back if you do the same on the original screen.   Is there anyway to stop it from moving? I will never want it on anything other than the original screen, it just freaks me out.   <comment280310> Could you be more clear about the problem ? <comment280364> The only *absolute* fix I know of is to switch off System prefs  Mission Control  Display have separate spaces. <comment342315> @Tetsujin this doesn't fix the problem. I have the same issue and it's very annoying, didn't find a solution so far.... <comment342318> It should do - I've had the dock on only one screen since Spaces was invented, by not using that setting.
