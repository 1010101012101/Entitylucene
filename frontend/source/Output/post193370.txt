What determines the label displayed in the "Kind" column of an OS X finder window and in search box labeled "Kind"? <body> What determines the label displayed in the "Kind" column of an OS X finder window and in search box labeled "Kind"?  For example, I use LaTeX, and all files with the extension .tex are labeled "LaTeX" in the finder Window and I have them set to open with SublimeText.  Did SublimeText set the file "Kind"?  Also, if I want to search for all file of type "LaTeX" the Finder search box only gives me a limited set of options for "Kind", e.g. Application, Archive, Document, etc. Can I change that option box to show "LaTeX".  <answer193375> h2CFBundleDocumentTypes/h2  To answer your first and second question:  OS X applications are able to register document types with the system. They do so by declaring those document types within the codeCFBundleDocumentTypes/code section in the codeInfo.plist/code file which resides inside the application bundle.  For example, you can find the entry for the emLaTeX/em kind by opening Terminal.app and invoking this command:  precode$ grep LaTeX -B4 -A7 /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  The resulting XML chunk defines the three-way relationship between the application, the name of the bundle type (aka emKind/em), and the respective file extensions:  precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeRole&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;Editor&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeName&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;LaTeX&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeExtensions&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;tex&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeIconFile&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;TeX&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  For more details about document types, see the section CFBundleDocumentTypes in the document emRegistering the File Types Your App Supports/em from Apple’s Developer Library.  h2Spotlight searches/h2  To answer your third question:     Can I change that option box to show "LaTeX"   Open the drop down box and choose emOther./em A text box appears; type the name of the file kind you wish to search for, or any substring of it.  If the emOther/em option won’t appear in the drop-down list, you might need to enable the option first by going to System Preferences » Spotlight and ticking the checkbox next to emOther/em.  <comment230487> Thanks. Is there a way to get 'LaTeX' to appear as an option in the drop down list? <comment230490> @pheon Not that I know of. I’ve found an interesting alternative to the drop-down list though: it’s possible to type `kind:latex` directly into the search field.
