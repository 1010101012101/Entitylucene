Is there a way to monitor which disks are spun down in a Mac Pro? <body> I have an 2009 Mac Pro full of disks, most of them seldom used (boots on a SSD). Is there a way to see which disks are spun down at a given time (currently running 10.6.8)?  <answer39904> I'm afraid this isn't made possible by the S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) system that is used to provide details of Hard Drive operation, I was hoping to find a SMART attribute that details the current 'park' status, but it seems that there simply isn't one, and as this is a low level activity that is fully handled by the drive itself without any OS input I cannot see a way of ever retrieving the status as the value isn't available in the first place.
