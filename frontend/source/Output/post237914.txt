Unable to Change Apple ID and password <body> I have tried repeatedly to change my Apple ID and password without success. I have followed all of the directions trying both my emails and asked for new passwords----no luck whatsoever.  <answer237919> If you've followed all the correct processes for changing your Apple ID, including verifying your email address is correct and looking in your spam/junk folder, then your only option is to contact Apple directly.  Go to Apple's Support page and click on codeTalk to us/code.  Initiate a chat session, that's the fastest way to get this resolved.
