Is there a difference between the "configurable" and installable memory limit? <body> On Apple's iMac page, it says:     Configurable to 8GB (all models) or 16GB (select models)   However both Apple's iMac: How to remove or install memory page and Crucial.com indicate that emall/em of the 2011 iMac models are configurable to 16 GB. Does the above quote simply mean than select models are only configurable to 16 GB emon the Apple online store/em? If I buy the $1200 iMac (MC309LL/A), I should be able to install 16 GB of RAM bought separately from Crucial, correct?  <answer29730> Correct. You may even upgrade it to 32GB.  <answer29829> Apple offers CTO and will let you fill your iMac (Late 2011) with RAM modules sized at 2 GB and 4 GB each.   From Apple, the entry level MC309LL/A has two RAM slots so you can take it to strong8 GB/strong em(2 x 4 GB SO-DIMM)/em but many reputable vendors are selling 8 GB modules that seem to work well and without issue on that hardware - strong16 GB/strong em(2 x 8 GB SO-DIMM)/em.  The rest of the Late 2011 iMacs have 4 RAM slots, so you can take them to strong32 GB/strong em(4 x 8 GB SO-DIMM)/em even though Apple intends / configures / supports / recommends a max of strong16 GB/strong em(4 x 4 GB SO-DIMM)/em for the rest of the lineup.  <comment34213> The iMac MC309LL/A has only two RAM slots. I know of no reputable vendor that has said a pair of 16 GB RAM will work to take that model to 32 GB. Have you actually tried a chip of that sizing? A pair of 8 works well as we tested some today on that exact model. <comment34214> What's ever worse is that the manuals for the iMacs say (incorrectly) that they all have 4 RAM slots. In fact, the model you mention has only two slots on the logic board. <comment34229> Why do so many sites (even Apple's own support page) claim it supports 16 GB and that it has 4 slots - have you personally seen that the latest MC309LL/A has only 2 memory slots? <comment34230> 21.5" always had 4 slots http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzZ9nRJz7AQ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGdW9cbZF0Y http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iMac-Intel-21-5-Inch-EMC-2428-Teardown/5485/1 <comment34231> Just a nitpick, but computers in general (including Macs) do **not** take ram *"Chips"*, they take RAM *modules*, or (colloquially) *sticks*. The RAM module has chips *on it*, but calling the whole thing a *chip* is akin to referring to an entire car as an engine or tire.
