Learn spelling keyboard shortcut <body> Apple spellchecker is very useful, but does not work very well for technical text as it is missing all brand names and 50% words, doing more damage than good.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d4c4C.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to do "Learn spelling" action as a keyboard shortcut, so that I don't need to go through empainful/em learn spelling right menu click every time. This starts to hurt after it is miscorrecting 100th word.  EDIT: Tried to add shortcut, but doesn't seem to work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BZHrM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment259462> I'm not sure how often you are writing new words, but on occasion I need to right click. It seems like you are doing it for every other word. Have you gone into Sys PrefsKeyboardShortcutsAll Applications, and added a shortcut? <comment259465> Please see edit.
