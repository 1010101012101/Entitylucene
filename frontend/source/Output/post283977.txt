Logical HDMI display reconnection <body> I have a Mac mini server with Yosemite, and I plugged a VGA Display using a VGA/HDMI adapter.  The issue is, when I shut down or restart the server, the display is not recognized, then I need to go to unplug and plug again, and server now recognizes the display.  I need to know how to make a logical "reconnection" for the adapter.   For example on Windows I use a devcom application to enable or disable the devices.   I was reading that the possible solution is using a codekextunload/code command on terminal.  I don't know which kextfile I need to "unload" for the HDMI adapter.  On terminal:  code/System/Library/Extensions//code  codekextunload exampleflile.kext/code  codekextload examplefile.kext/code  Anybody have an idea about my issue? Another way to solve it?  Thanks in advance  Greetings from Mexico.  <answer283979> You most likely need an strongactive/strong HDMI to VGA adapter.  There is a bunch of signaling conversion that goes on with an adapter, especially when it goes from digital (HDMI) to analog (VGA).  An active adapter will reformat the signals so it's a true VGA signal rather than just supply the correct pin outs.  Take a look at this answer, Passive vs. Active adapters - I talk about the difference and why it's important.
