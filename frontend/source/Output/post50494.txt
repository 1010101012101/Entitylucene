Creating a keyboard shortcut for "Show Path Bar" in Finder <body> It seems there's no built-in keyboard shortcut for "Show Path Bar" in Finder. How can I create one?  <answer50495> Use a Spark which will allow you to create a keyboard shortcut from an AppleScript. Then, create an AppleScript that clicks the "Show Path Bar" in the menu.   precodetell application "System Events"     set UI_enabled to UI elements enabled end tell -- Checks to see if UI scripting is enabled if UI_enabled is false then     tell application "System Preferences"         activate         set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"         display dialog "This script utilizes the built-in Graphic User Interface Scripting architecture of Mac OS x which is currently disabled." &amp; return &amp; return &amp; "You can activate GUI Scripting by selecting the checkbox \"Enable access for assistive devices\" in the Universal Access preference pane." with icon 1 buttons {"Cancel"} default button 1     end tell end if if UI_enabled is true then     -- Actual code that clicks the button     tell application "Finder" to activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Finder"             tell menu bar 1                 tell menu bar item "View"                     tell menu "View"                         click menu item 12                     end tell                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell end if /code/pre  <answer50516> Go to the Keyboard preference pane in System Preferences and choose the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. In the left column, choose Application Shortcuts like shown in the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IqRjY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click the plus button and add a keyboard shortcut entry for Finder for the "Show Path Bar" menu item. Since the title of the "Show Path Bar" menu item changes to "Hide Path Bar" once the path bar is shown, you might want to add a shortcut for that as well.  <comment57995> Thanks, this is a perfect solution. I added another shortcut for "Hide Path Bar" and the same keys and now I can use the same shortcut to toggle path bar visibility on or off.
