Can I view the list of songs within a podcast while playing it? <body> When playing a podcast on my iPhone, can I view the names of the songs (or whatever show notes are embedded into the podcast metadata?  <answer30140> There is a (non-obvious) way to see whatever information was provided by the person who made the podcast. emWhether it lists the songs will depend on how much info they actually provided/em.  To see the info about a podcast, when listening to it, click on the main area of the display - as marked with a stronglarge/strong red rectangle below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0XFLO.png" alt="enter image description here"  This takes you to a sort of detailed view:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BhmNa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Clicking on the text description here takes you back to the first view (pictorial representation of the podcast).  One extra thing: Clicking on the little icon at top-right, that looks like a sort of list (shown in the strongsmall/strong red rectangle in the first image above), takes you to the list of "episodes" that you have for this podcast, e.g.:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fh3HS.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongEdit: What about viewing podcast info on iOS 5 iPad?/strong  This info subsequently moved to @JasonSalaz's separate iPad question  <comment34592> Which version of iOS are you using? <comment34600> I'm using iOS 5 - NB the question is tagged with ios-5... <comment34601> The music app on iOS 5 on an iPhone is very dramatically different than on an iPad. I don't believe I can do the same thing you've described here, which is very disappointing to me. I assumed (wrongly, I note) that all the changes the iPad version has, also made it to the iPhone. Talk about feeling left out in the cold. <comment34607> @JasonSalaz I agree, but this question is about iPhone, not iPad - as you say, they are different beasts. Suggest you start a question about iPad instead (if one doesn't exist already) - and I'll add an iPad-based answer there... <comment34650> You're one smart cookie :). http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/30211/1346 <comment34652> Doh - I've just gone ahead and edited my answer here - I'll move it to your new question!
