How to access WebDAV shared folder on Mac OS X Server <body> Mac OS X Server supports WebDAV and allows iPhones/iPads to connect, store and retrieve files.  While Mac OS X can access WebDAV servers from the Finder using "Connect to Server" (kbdCommand/kbd+kbdK/kbd) attempting to connect to the root of a Mac OS X server or any other assumed location results in an error:     There was a problem connecting to the server “theserver.domain.com”.br   Check the server name or IP address, and then try again. If you continue to have problems, contact your system administrator   I can only guess that there is some special URL/URI that is necessary but what?  <answer252184> Here is how it partially works.  The server's WebDAV interface is presented from a virtual directory "webdav". If your server is at   precodehttps://theserver.domain.com  /code/pre  then the beginning of your WebDAV access starts at:  precodehttps://theserver.domain.com/webdav/ /code/pre  This will typically be your "home folder" if the server is setup to offer users home folders.    And while it does not represent your actual directory structure , all other shared volumes are tacked on to the end of that. So if you mark a folder as shared with "WebDAV" thusly:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EqdUp.png" alt="WebDAV Shared Folder"  then the access would be:  precodehttps://theserver.domain.com/webdav/swap/ /code/pre  Caveats:  ul liURI is case sensitive/li liusername aliases are not respected, you must use the "short name" for login, even from the Mac OS X Finder's friendly login dialog/li liWiki storage access with WebDAV ... still not clear on the URI/li /ul  <comment313705> What version of OS are you running on the server? <comment328396> macOS 10.12.1, was 10.12.0 at the point of this post
