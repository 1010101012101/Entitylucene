Comment to "Logitech mouse scrolling weird after Sierra update; soggy inertia effect in native apps, choppy in third-party apps" <body> I wasn't able to comment on this thread since I don't have enough reputation points. Here is my experience which may be helpful to others: The latest Logitech Control Center Version: 3.9.5.66 does not fix the glitch/laggy scrolling behavior with my Logitech USB mouse on MacOS Sierra 10.12.1, so I uninstalled it. Installing USB Overdrive 3.3 emdid/em fix it, however the scrolling is still less smooth than it used to be. I then added Smart Scroll 4.2.1 and it made all scrolling super smooth. I still needed to keep USB Overdrive 3.3 enabled (disabling it made starting scrolling laggy/glitchy, even though once scrolling started it was smooth with Smart Scroll). This is solution that worked well for me: as always, YMMV :)  <comment326962> With a bit of editing this could be posted as an answer to the question.
