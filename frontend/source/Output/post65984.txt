Enable f12 shortcut for firebug <body> I was wondering, how to enable the F12 shortcut key on OS X for Firebug? I don't really use Dashboard, so I'm more than happy to disable it.   <answer65986> You can disable or change the shortcut for Dashboard in codeSystem Preferences/code -  codeMission Control/code for Mac OS X 10.7+. In older versions of Mac OS X the appropriate preference pane should be called codeExposé/code.  After you changed the shortcut, it should correctly activate Firebug instead when Firefox is active.  <answer177434> Why not use kbd⌘/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdF12/kbd? It works on for me.  <comment77644> Worked like a charm, ty. <comment121497> Nice. All I had to do was disable the default behavior for `f12` in Mission Control and the shortcut began to work beautifully.
