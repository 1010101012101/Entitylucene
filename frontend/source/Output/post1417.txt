LaunchBar/Quicksilver as a replacement of Spotlight? <body> I asked about the usefulness of spotlight here, as I don't like the drag that spotlight causes all the time.  What I found useful in Spotlight is those two.  ul liword lookup : spotlight opens 'Dictionary' App automatically when it can look the word up./li lisearch for PDF /li /ul  And one of the answer that I got is from 'Dan Ray' saying "Personally, I disable it in favor of Quicksilver.".  I don't use Quicksilver, but LaunchBar, but it seems to me that LaunchBar doesn't look up the pdf. And, furthermore, it has an option to search in Spotlight.  and My questions are   ul liCan LaunchBar can do the two things? Look into Dictionary, and pdf search?/li liCan QuickSilver can do the two things?/li /ul  If one of the tools can do that, I guess I just disable Spotlight, and enjoy the speedup.  <answer2726> Unrelated answer, but you may want to try Alfred. An actively developed alternative to Quicksilver.   <answer2934> QuickSliver has Spotlight plugin and Dictionary (which can fetch definition from dict.org plugin.  The spotlight plugin allows you to search for a string in either Finder, Window or a command window.  <comment1212> I use quicksilver and it can't search in pdf by default maybe can do it with some plugin or script. <comment1224> Both QUickSilver and LaunchBar maintain an index of files (among other things) but as far as I understand they both rely on Spotlight for a lot of things. What drag is spotlight really causing you? Once the drive is fully indexed, there shouldn’t be any drag at all, unless you’re adding gigs of data every day that needs to be added to the index.
