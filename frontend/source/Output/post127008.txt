Why is Parallels 8 suddenly "not supported on this type of mac"? <body> I've been running Parallels 8 on my mac with Mavericks just fine for weeks now. Last night I was using it. Suddenly I wake up this morning and when I try to start it, I get the message "You can't open the application 'Parallels Desktop' because it is not supported on this type of Mac.  What could be causing this? I didn't update anything overnight.  <comment150915> Have you tried contacting Parallels support?  This seems like a support issue. <comment150994> Yea I found their forums and posted there as well. They suggested to uninstall-reinstall Parallels, which did fix it and was quicker than I thought it would be. I was worried that I would have had to re-install the Windows VM as well, but apparently that is separate, and you can reinstall Parallels without having to reinstall Windows, and all your stuff on your Windows VM stays intact.
