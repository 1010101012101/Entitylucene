listing files with extension in Terminal <body> in a Terminal session the command   precodels *.pdf -l /code/pre  does not list the pdfs (or whatever other file format) as expected, as the -l option seems to be ignored. Everything works fine if I issue a simple  precodels -l /code/pre  How do I fix this?  I'm on Mac OS X 10.7.5 and using a bash shell.  <answer159716> Just place the code-l/code flag before the other arguments, like this:  precodels -l *.pdf /code/pre  <answer159746> If you want codels/code (and other commands) feeling like on a linux system, you should install homebrew by typing:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  In order the codels/code command to work like you said, after installing homebrew, you need the coreutils package.  precodebrew install coreutils /code/pre  After that, you will use like you want.  <comment187685> Just to expand, arguments should always precede the object of the command: `command - arguments - object` unless the `man` pages indicate that certain arguments need to follow the object. <comment187686> Alright, thanks! I was pretty sure it was different in Ubuntu, but maybe I'm wrong... <comment187694> @FredS: It is. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12722/porting-linux-shell-scripts?rq=1
