Application Cannot Write to Network Share <body> I have a volume shared via NFS and SMB with my ebooks. I am using an app (reBOOK) to make changes to the meta data.  When trying to save from the application, I get the message that it cannot write back. This is true whether I use the SMB share or the NFS share (or CIFS, which the typical workaround for SMB problems).  In both cases, I can make changes through the Finder, so I can verify that I have full access to this volume. I have also ensured that the permissions are correct (I have RW access, and so does my group).  The application can save changes on a local volume.  I have some other applications (such as Atom Text Editor) which have no problems.  The question is what would make a volume unwritable to an application, and how can I make it writable?
