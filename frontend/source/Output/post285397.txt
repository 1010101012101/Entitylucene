AirPlay turned off and can't be turned on <body> I have a MacBook Air and with no apparent reason the AirPlay icon has dissapeared from the desktop. When I go to System Preferences → Displays, the status of AirPlay shows "Off" and there's no way to change it since it doesn't show the "On" option.  <answer285398> The AirPlay icon in the menu bar is only shown when an AirPlay device is available, per the option ‘Show mirroring options in the menu bar emwhen available/em’ (emphasis mine).  You're unable to change the option from Off because there are no AirPlay devices to choose from. There is no ‘On’ option ever, only a list of devices to choose, except there are no devices found so the list is empty.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rAiwU.png" width="374"  There is never an AirPlay icon on the desktop.
