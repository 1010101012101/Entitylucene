How can I iterate through a folder and move/copy every Nth item <body> I want to make a time lapse from a folder of images, but there are too many and the time lapse progresses to slowly.  How do I select, for example, every 10th item, and either copy or move the items into a separate folder?  <answer225676> The quickest way is to use codebash/code and codeawk/code syntax in your strongTerminal.app/strong  precodefor file in `find /SOURCE/DIR -type f | awk 'NR %10 == 0'`; do echo mv $file /DEST/DIR ; done /code/pre  hr  codefor/code statement introduces the codebash loop/code, to iterate through a set of data where codefile/code is the variable.   codefind/code parses the code/SOURCE/DIR/code for that which is specified.  code|/code acts as a pipe, passing stout from codefind/code back to stdin  codeawk/code interprets stdin and prints only lines meeting the conditions specified by code'NR %10 == 0’/code  ul licodeNR/code is an codeawk built-in variable/code that specifies the record/line number to be evaluated. /li licode%/code is a codenumerical operator/code telling awk that the following character(s) must be treated as such./li licode==/code is relational operator for codemust be equal to../code/li licode0/code is the binary expression for codeTRUE/code /li /ul  So, that’s all fancy for  strong"find every 10th file that exists in this directory and output it/strong;   ul licodedo/code introduces the action to perform on the output./li licodeecho/code is used to double check the command, the results of which will be printed to stout.

I am not sure this will work, try putting double or single quotes around `$file` in the command so the middle part looks like `do echo mv "$file" /DEST/DIR` or `do echo mv '$file' /DEST/DIR` and possibly escape the quotes but I don't think you'll need to: `do echo mv \"$file\" /DEST/DIR`
