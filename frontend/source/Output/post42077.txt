Is it possible to prevent renaming of file extensions when dragging images from the browser? <body> I have noticed that when I drag a JPG file from Google Chrome to my desktop, OS X conveniently (?) renames it to code&lt;filename&gt;.jpeg/code, even though the extension was originally code.jpg/code.  Is this behavior caused by OS X, and can I disable it?  <comment47806> That's a good one.  Can't think of a way to stop it, but as a workaround you could set a folder action on your download folder (or location you drag the file to) to rename any incming .jpeg to be .jpg
