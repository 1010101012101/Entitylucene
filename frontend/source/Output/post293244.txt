iOS to TV - Flixster, Amazon and Netflix <body> travelling a lot and I have an iPad and iPhone with Amazon Instant Video, Netflix and Flixster running on it with some content downloaded for offline viewing as hotel wifi is rubbish for streaming.  I'd like to be able to put the content onto the TV. But, I think I know that Amazon Instant Video won't put video out over the outbound HDMI, or airplay. I think Flixster and Netflix both support Chromecast.  It's all a bit of a mess as far as I can see.  So if I want to jack into a hotel TV via the HDMI port and stream content from my apps, what's the best I can achieve?  Can I use them all via Chromecast or Fire TV sticks?  I don't want to jail break, which seems the nuclear option :)
