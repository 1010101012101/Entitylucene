Is it possible to include a shared calender from Exchange in the calendar app on Mac OS X? <body> I've Mac OS X 10.9.5 installed. On this machine you can find the calendar app. In Outlook it is possible to add a shared calendar from exchange. Here I don't need a username/password. I can easily add this calendar.  Can I add such a shared exchange calendar to the calendar app?  <answer169079> I just had this problem and just figured it out using the instructions on this page.    Here are the steps:   ol liLogin to Outlook Web Access (the web interface for your Exchange Server)./li liClick on public folders (for me, it was all they way in the bottom left).  /li liThe, navigate to the public folder of your choice (I needed a calendar).  /li liRight click on the public calendar and select copy from the context menu./li liNavigate back to your own mailbox (I clicked "mail" in the lower left). /li liRight click on your own calendar and click paste (I added it to a new folder). /li liThen, return to calendar.app and refresh your calendars (View menu - refresh or command R).  /li liAfter doing that, the public calendar popped up along side my other calendars.  /li /ol  Hope it works as well for you as it just did for me!  Also, I think this question is a duplicate of this one.   <answer248092> The above doesnt' REALLY work for people, especially not with Outlook 365. Here's the way that worked for me:   ol liWith iCal open go to the menu bar at the top of the screen and select iCal, it's to the right of the Apple Symbol in the upper left corner./li liSelect Preferences/li liOnce the Preferences window comes up select the Accounts section then select the Exchange account to bring up its information. /li liNow select the Delegation tab. /li liUnder the list is a + sign. Click this to add a calendar./li liBegin typing the user's name as above and the auto-completion will begin. Once you've found the correct user's name select it to add it under the Users column./li liUnder Accounts I can access: you will now see that user's name. You can enable or disable their calendar from displaying by checking or unchecking the boxes under the Show header./li /ol  I found these instructions from the USC website.   <comment197753> yes you can as many calendars as you like. <comment197754> But how do I do that? <comment198628> Thanks for your answer. In my public folder I can't find any calendar. There are only some contacts of my organization. Now I tried to add the calendar to Outlook Web Access under the menu calendar. I can see the calendar in OWA but in my Calendar app the calendar doesn't appear (even after refresh). <comment228257> If you set up your account from Mail you should sync contacts and suddenly I could search and add the exchange calendars on my collegues! <comment228653> @TobiasHÃ¸st: How can I sync contacts? There is only the general sync button. Could you possibly explain in more detail what you have done? E.g. step for step instruction? <comment318632> This did the trick. <comment327122> D Woods answer didn't work for me at all, and this one works perfectly.  Thank you. <comment329744> My user account added, but greyed out. Calendars and Tasks both have 'no access' text. What's wrong?
