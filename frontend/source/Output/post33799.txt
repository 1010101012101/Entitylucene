Is there a way to delete only documents/data of an app without deleting the app itself? <body> I am running out of space on my iPhone and since iOS 5 I can see the worst offenders in Settings - General - Usage.br Some apps while being very small themselves have accumulated a lot of data. I want to keep the app itself on the phone but would like to get rid of the data.    Is there a way to delete the data/documents directly on the phone without deleting the app itself?br Or is re-installing the app the only possible way?  <answer33800> If the application doesn't provide a way to delete documents, uninstalling and reinstalling the app is definitively the best option here.  <comment252188> Hmm, are there any "jailbroken power apps" (like iFile) that can achieve this?
