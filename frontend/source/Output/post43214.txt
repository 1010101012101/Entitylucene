Paste text stored on Clipboard to a variable using pbpaste <body> I have some text stored on my clipboard. I want to store this text onto a shell script "variable".  So something like:  precodels -altr &gt; pbcopy tmp="something" pbpaste &gt; $tmp    # this doesn't get the ls command output :( echo $tmp         # should not print something /code/pre  <answer43217> Try  precodels | pbcopy tmp=$(pbpaste) /code/pre  And don't forget to remove the files called codepbcopy/code and codesomething/code you created with your first and second line.  <answer43219> This works for me...  precode#!/bin/bash  ls -altr | pbcopy tmp=`pbpaste` echo $tmp /code/pre  You needed a pipe rather than redirect on the codepbcopy/code line and you can use code=/code to assign codetmp/code to the result of codepbpaste/code - remembering the backticks around codepbpaste/code, of course, otherwise it will just echo the word "pbpaste"!   <comment49134> lol @patrix...thanks for that. extra points for humor. <comment49137> Thanks @binarybob, this solution works too. yup backticks is important, also not to be mistaken for single quotes '
