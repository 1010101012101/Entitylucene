How can I remotely control my iMac user desktop from a Windows computer? <body> I know the IP address of my iMac and I have been able to ssh into the computer successfully, but I want to be able to control the desktop remotely from my Windows machine as well.  How do I enable my iMac to do this?  Is there a special program I need to use on my Windows 7 machine to do control the desktop remotely?  <answer62679> You can use VNC to remotely control your Mac. There's instructions around here to turn on the built-in OS X VNC server (it's pretty straightforward), and a Windows VNC viewer (I linked to a Google search because I don't know a particular good viewer for Windows because I don't use VNC on Windows).   <answer62680> Look into TeamViewer. It has a mode to do just just that.  <answer62803> Your best option is to use LogMeIn. It allows you to set different resolutions, you can perform Mac gestures, and it uses the least bandwidth of any remote control app I have ever used (about 10-15Kbps for a 1280x720 screen). It is cross platform too.  You create a LogMeIn account and you can either use the Windows client or the web-based client.   <comment75972> Another advantage of LogMeIn is that you can easily use it outside of the LAN without having to keep track of your current IP address. <comment75974> Yeah, thatâ€™s awesome too. In VNC you have to know the IP of the host.
