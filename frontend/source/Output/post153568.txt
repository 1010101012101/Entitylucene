GhostScript has long been installed. I just installed the latest (9.15). Running codegs/code in Terminal launches the GhostScript command line tool. codewhich gs/code tells me code/usr/local/bin/gs/code.  I tried restarting CUPS (codesudo launchctl [stop/start] org.cups.cupsd/code). I also symlinked gs to /usr/bin and /sbin.  Why can't it find codegs/code when I actually try to print?  <answer166837> If you look in your console, you'll probably see a message about sandboxd preventing gs from running. Just add this line to the end of /etc/cups/cups-files.conf:     Sandboxing Relaxed   then type:  precodesudo launchctl stop org.cups.cupsd /code/pre  <comment181545> I still haven't fixed it, but folks with similar problems have. See https://discussions.apple.com/message/26887951#26887951. It has to do with new sandbox restrictions in Yosemite or something.
