Enable KVM on VMWare Fusion <body> I'm running Linux in a VM on my VMWare Fusion. I want to use qemu-kvm within the Linux VM (yes, I know it's not efficient).  QEMU reports the following problem:  precodeCould not access KVM kernel module: No such file or directory failed to initialize KVM: No such file or directory /code/pre  <answer192526> Edit the .vmx file within your VM image. For example, if your VM is named "Ubuntu", edit codeUbuntu.vmwarevm/Ubuntu.vmx/code (to get into the .vmwarevm in Finder, select Show Package Contents).  Within the .vmx file, add the following line:  precodevhv.enable = "TRUE" /code/pre  Restart the VM and you could use KVM.
