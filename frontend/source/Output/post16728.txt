Macbook can't resolve any domain names <body> I have a 13" Macbook running Snow Leopard 10.6.6 which is unable to go to any URL on either my office or hotel networks.  I have no proxy or firewall enabled on the computer - and have connected to both networks in the past without issue.  If I ping google.com, it responds with 'cannot resolve google.com, unknown host' - however if I ping the IP it responds fine. I can also visit the IP in my browser and it goes to the page successfully.  I have rebooted, flushed my cache in several ways, tried to use Google's DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) all to no avail.  Any advice would be super!  <answer16729> I think it has to do with Bonjour (mDNSResponder). strongCheck out this page./strong  Run the following command in a Terminal:  precodeps aux | grep mDNS /code/pre  This should tell you whether or not /usr/sbin/mDNSResponder is running. If it is not, run the following command to launch it:  precodesudo /usr/sbin/mDNSResponder /code/pre  <comment18270> also, my /etc/hosts file looks as it always has <comment18273> Thanks Jon! mDNSResponder was running, so I unloaded then loaded it - following the instructions on the link you provided - and it works perfectly! <comment18274> Glad to hear, Dan! Cheers!
