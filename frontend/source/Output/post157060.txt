Icons disappearing from menu bar <body> I have the problem that occasionally on startup, icons are missing from the menu bar. This includes e.g. Clock, User name, Wi-Fi, Menu Meters and Notification Center. It does not apply to e.g. Little Snitch, lastfm, Spotlight and Watts. So it is not an issue of OS X versus other apps.  It looks like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ghBwQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This phenomenon appeared with Yosemite.  <answer157061> Although I do not know the problem, there are several solutions.  ol liReboot or Log out./li liKill the SystemUIServer process, either via Activity Monitor or via codekillall SystemUIServer/code. The UI server will restart and the problem will be gone. I've seen it happen that I needed to kill it twice to fully take effect./li /ol  <answer186459> I thought I'd add that I had this issue again in Yosemite 10.10.3. A disk repair, 10.10.3 download &amp; reinstall, deleting SystemUI preferences code.plist/code, etc. had no effect for me.  What emdid/em work is a simple strongSafe Mode boot/strong. No actual changes in Safe Mode, simply booting into it fixed my system menu bar icons. A reboot back into normal mode still had them fixed.  You can access Safe Mode by holding kbdShift/kbd right after the chime during startup.  <answer282926> If you write killall SystemUIServer in terminal it will fix it!  <comment184680> try log in as different user to check if it is your profile. <comment243944> THanks!! this worked and saved me a lot of time from rebooting every time <comment355063> quitting `SystemUIServer` immediately did the trick (OS X 10.12.4). <comment356619> This is no different that the accepted answer from several years ago. If you have additional, updated, or different info, please add it to your answer.
