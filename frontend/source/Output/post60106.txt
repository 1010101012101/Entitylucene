Move application to another desktop directly <body> When I open my application on strongdesktop 1/strong. I can't open it in strongdesktop 2/strong, it will jump back to strongdesktop 1/strong.  Can I directly move the application to desktop 2 without exiting the application?  <answer60111> On desktop 1, open the Mission Control (four fingers, swipe up), you will see desktop spaces on top of the screen.  Move the application to desktop 2.  Or, on desktop 1, drag the application, move it to the right edge of the screen, wait two second, the desktop will be switch to desktop 2, and your application will be there.  <answer60130> Another way: you can press mouse button on window's border and then press codeCtrl + â†’/code (default) to move selected window (without releasing mouse button).  <comment69212> thanks this is what I'm looking for
