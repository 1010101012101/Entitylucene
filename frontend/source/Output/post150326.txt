How can I change the text on the shutdown window? <body> When you press the power button on a mac laptop, a window is shown that reads "Are you sure you want to shut down your computer now?" An image of the power symbol is shown next to this text and at the bottom of the window there is a checkbox to enable the reopening of windows when logging back in, as well as four buttons, Restart, Sleep, Cancel and Shut Down. I want to be able to change the text shown on the buttons, checkbox and the "Are you sure you want to shut down your computer now?" text.  Thanks in advance.
