Target iMac does not wake up with the main iMac <body> I have two 27" iMac connected via a Thunderbolt cable. I press kbdCommand/kbd+kbdF2/kbd, the target computer joyfully becomes a second screen for the primary iMac. Joy of joys!  I come back in the morning, or after lunch, and I press a key on my computer. The display lights up, everything is where it should be.  Unfortunately, the display computer stays off. I haven't found a way to bring it back on, other than pressing the power button, waiting for it a little (this disables target mode),  then pressing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdF2/kbd again. This, of course, re-enables target mode.  Any idea what I could be doing differently and better, for a wholesome dual-27" experience?  <answer63772> You can bring it back on by going to strongSystem Preferences / Displays/strong and choose emDetect Displays/em. It can take a couple of minutes to get it back, though.  Apple suggests a SMC reset when ema computer that supports target display mode does not switch into or out of the target display mode as expected./em  To do so, just:  ol liShutdown the computer which is not functioning as expected./li liUnplug the computer's power cord./li liWait fifteen seconds./li liAttach the computer's power cord./li liWait five seconds, then press the power button to turn on the computer./li /ol  <comment73777> I'll have to try that; thanks.
