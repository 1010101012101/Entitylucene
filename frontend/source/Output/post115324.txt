App not showing in Accessibility pane in Security & Privacy <body> Recently Maintenance.app asked for permission to have control over certain aspects of my computer and I granted that app access, but it doesnâ€™t show inside Accessibility pane of Security &amp; Privacy.  Running codesudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/Tcc.db 'SELECT * FROM access'/code displays every app I gave that permission, Maintenance.app included.  code kTCCServiceAccessibility|com.manytricks.Moom|0|1|0|?? kTCCServiceAccessibility|com.titanium.Maintenance|0|1|0|?? /code  So obviously it has that access.  Is there some cache which prevents OSX in displaying every app in GUI?
