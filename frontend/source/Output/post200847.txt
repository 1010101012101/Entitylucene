MacBookPro temperature inconsistency <body> I have a 15" MacbookPro with a Windows 7 Bootcamp partition. I check the temperature when using Windows but I think it doesn't report the right temperature. I shut down Windows with a temperature between the 70° and 80° degrees, then I immediately power on the laptop but this time I use OS X, when I log in it reports temperatures closes to 100° degrees.  It is possible that when I use Windows it is reporting wrong temperatures? If yes, what software should I use to monitor them correctly?  In OS X I use TG pro, in Windows I've tried many softwares but all of them reports the same data.  <answer200858> In OSX you can also try many applications, one might give you the GPU or Motherboard temp instead of the CPU temp.  OSX temperature apps:  atMonitor or smcFanControl  OSX might also take more resources than Windows. To minimize running apps, clear your startup items under Users in System Preferences, or check your Activity Monitor which shows your CPU% and Threads for each application, this way you can close apps that are using too much resources.
