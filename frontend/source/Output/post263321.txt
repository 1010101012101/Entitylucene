Ipod Touch 6 Gen Update 10.1.1 <body> Recently updated my ipod touch with the latest software (10.1.1). Really don't like the new display settings. Is it possible to revert to older display settings before the update? (For example removing the radio option and having an artist's albums displayed in list format rather than in pictures.)  Thanks!
