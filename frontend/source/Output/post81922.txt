Remove all references to Parallels 7 Windows 7 VM programs <body> My system has been polluted with references to programs residing in a Windows 7 VM in Parallels 7.  For example, Windows programs show up in Spotlight, and in Safari settings under strongGeneral-Default browser/strong I get an annoyingly long list of irrelevant Windows programs.  I've tried to disable "Share Windows applications with Mac" in Parallels settings, to no avail.  This blog post suggests to add the strongApplications (Parallels)/strong folder to the Spotlight privacy list, but I can't do that because I don't have that folder. I deleted it some months ago in an unsuccessful attempt to remove the same references as now.  The VM is on a USB disk that's usually not connected so these references must be stored in OS X somewhere. How and where are this links stored and how can I get rid of them?  <answer83959> I found a solution that may be specific to my setup, buy may be useful to others too.  ul liI had moved the folder with the Windows applications shortcuts elsewhere and had forgotten about it. I deleted this folder./li liI deleted duplicates from Finder's 'Open With' menu using code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user/code followed by codesudo killall Finder/code.
