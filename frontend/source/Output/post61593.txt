How to delete synced photos from iPhone without connecting to mac? <body> I have synced a folder which contains some pictures to my iPhone. The synced photos are successfully copied to my iPhone. But I can not see any "delete" option in my iPhone to remove the synced photos.  The "Camera Roll" which has the pictures that I took via the iPhone's camera have an option "delete" in the bottom of the picture. But synced photos does not have that delete button.  Should I use iTunes/Mac to delete synced photos? Can't I delete the synced photos with a single touch?  <answer61595> emSynced Photos/em deleting must be done through iTunes.

Can I add photos to my iPhone without using the "sync" process? If so, does those pictures can be deleted without iTunes? <comment71131> The only ways that come to my mind are sending them through mail and safe them to your camera roll, or using some sort of cloud storage as dropbox. Either way, you'll be able to delete them without iTunes. <comment71138> Really thanks.. So, I'm clear now.
