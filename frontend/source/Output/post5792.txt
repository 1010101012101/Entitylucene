Link formatting in Automator's New Mail Message <body> I would like to send an email with automator and have a link that shows a couple words (for e.g. name of the site) instead of the whole URL like you can do with the add link inside of Mac OS.  I have tried just writing the link as HTML as shown below but that didn't work.  Is this possible?  precode&lt;a href="http://foo.com"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre  <answer13730> This is emnot possible/em.  Mail's AppleScript API also does not allow for proper RTF mail. The following fails to create a proper mail body with links and everything, something clearly there in code/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Clipboard Viewer/code (part of Xcode 4):  precodetell application "Mail"     set theRTF to the clipboard rule «class rtf »     set msg to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:"Test", content:theRTF}     make new recipient at end of to recipients of msg with properties {address:"danielbeck@example.org"}     send msg end tell /code/pre  hr  You can try to use GUI scripting to copy&amp;paste rich text using the clip board and the actual emCopy/Paste/em menu items.  <comment6031> I'm having difficulty understanding your question. Could you please give a few more details, or explain what it is that isn't working for you?
