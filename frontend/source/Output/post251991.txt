Mac automator to rerun a python script if first attempt failed <body> I wrote a python script to automatically send emails and used automator to run it by run shell:   precode/usr/local/bin/python /Users/austin/PycharmProjects/assignments/assignments.py /code/pre  This assignments.py prints 'successfully sent the mail' after emails are sent  I'm wondering if there is a way to let automator rerun this script if it did not receive the 'successfully sent the mail'  <answer257345> It really depends - is there any "pause" or do you want to continually keep sending emails? This sounds a bit SPAM-y?  If you have created a 'process' that does some checks and then if there is work to be performed - it does its work and when finished goes back to "sleep".  This sounds more like a daemon task loop.  You can leverage launchctl.  It will keep a daemon/process running indefinitely. I'd suggest you install your script in your stronguser/strong space not the system.  The only difference is it will not start up until you log into your Mac.  <comment313404> For example when the networking has problem. <comment313405> Probably this could be done by using schedule in the python script. Still curious if automator can realize this. <comment313468> The usual way is for a script to return a status code
