How to reset ACLs after Apple Server sharing mistake? <body> I wanted to share my root file system and in Server.app I set up code//code as a share.  Unfortunately it wrote ACLs across the system that have caused a lot of various problems.  codesudo chmod -RN /*/code has resolved most of the issues, but there are still some permission issues on 10.12.2.  codesudo /Applications/OnyX.app/Contents/Resources/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume //code is still reporting a few folders as still having ACLs that it can't repair with repeated executions, example:  precodeACL missing on 'System/Library/User Template/ro.lproj/Library'. Repaired "System/Library/User Template/ro.lproj/Library". ACL missing on 'System/Library/User Template/ro.lproj/Public'. Repaired "System/Library/User Template/ro.lproj/Public". ACL missing on 'private/etc/pam.d'. Repaired "private/etc/pam.d". ACL missing on 'private/etc/ssh'. Repaired "private/etc/ssh". ACL missing on 'System/Library/User Template/Dutch.lproj/Desktop'. Repaired "System/Library/User Template/Dutch.lproj/Desktop". ACL missing on 'System/Library/User Template/Dutch.lproj/Library'. Repaired "System/Library/User Template/Dutch.lproj/Library". ACL missing on 'System/Library/User Template/Dutch.lproj/Library/Application Support'. … /code/pre  It seems that I'm going to need to issue some other commands to remove the new ACL accident.  What other commands and / or options exist to reset everything back to a pristine state and thus allow coderepair_packages/code to execute and repair permissions properly?  Following the above, I then managed to execute: codesudo chflags -R nouchg,nouappnd /System/Library/User\ Template//code  …and that seems to have resolved most of the issues now at least in that folder, but when I execute it on the remaining folders I still don't see any help.  Example, here are the ones that are remaining unprepared:  precodeACL found but not expected on 'installer.failurerequests'. Repaired "installer.failurerequests". ACL found but not expected on 'private/etc/aliases'. Repaired "private/etc/aliases". ACL found but not expected on 'private/etc/localtime'. Repaired "private/etc/localtime". ACL found but not expected on 'private/etc/resolv.conf'. Repaired "private/etc/resolv.conf". /code/pre  <answer264996> Everything is fine and the ACL repair is working as it should. Take the first two lines of the output:  precodeACL missing on 'System/Library/User Template/ro.lproj/Library'. Repaired "System/Library/User Template/ro.lproj/Library". /code/pre  The first line is logged when an incorrect ACL has been found. The second line is logged when the repair is a success. If the ACL couldn't be repaired, this second line would say something different. Everything is good!  <comment332208> Well that's very interesting because the system was exploding all over the place for me until I stripped back those ACLs.  Apps were not starting; I was not able to execute various commands.  Skitch couldn't use the user tmp folder. I was getting the macOS error about repairing my library, on and on.  Once I executed the above, everything normalized again and the system is back to being operational...
