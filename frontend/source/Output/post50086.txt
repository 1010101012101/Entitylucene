Completely uninstall Adobe CS5 <body> I once installed Adobe CS 5 as a Trial but now I pre-ordered the new suite. I've deleted the Adobe CS 5 suite, and installed the new suite. But whenever I try to open photoshop for example, the Software Setup pops up and tells me my trial of CS 5 has expired and I need to enter a serial.br I don't know if it will accept my CS 6 serial, but I first want to get rid of all (!) the CS 5 files.  I've tried the Adobe CS Cleaner tool, deleting the .cache and .pcd file in em/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe PCD/em, but it's still asking for a serial... So I'm guessing there are still some files emsomewhere/em.  So, how do I delete ALL files of Adobe CS 5, so I can start over with a fresh copy of CS 6?  <answer50091> I'd start with the actual uninstaller rather than the cleaner.  ul lihttp://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/uninstall-creative-suite-cs5-cs5.html/li /ul  Adobe does do deep integration, and I've been known to just walk away from machines with too much adobe on them. If you feel the uninstaller isn't getting things clean enough, you can take it a step further as follows:  ul liPerform a clean install of the OS/li liuse Migration Assistant to bring in the user account rather than setting up a new user on the "clean" Mac/li lidownload the uninstaller onto the new admin account/li /ul  At that point, you can run the uninstaller to clean out any ~/Library plugins that might be installed. It's overkill, but sometimes a clean start is better than trying to let uninstallers find every copy of files that have been zipped, moved, linked, etc...  <answer50646> To completely uninstall Adobe Apps you need to run the uninstaller in codeApplications/Utilities/Adobe Installers/code.  <answer121039> Some of this may be repetitive but follow these steps and you should have absolutely positively NO trace of Adobe left on your computer.  ul liRemove all Adobe fonts from /System/Library/Fonts, /Library/Fonts/, ~/Library/Fonts/li liRemove all these additional fonts from the same folders:  kbdWarnockPro-Bold.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-LightDisp.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-BoldCapt.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-LightIt.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-BoldDisp.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-LightItCapt.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-BoldIt.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-LightItDisp.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-BoldItCapt.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-LightItSubh.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-BoldItDisp.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-LightSubh.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-BoldItSubh.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-Regular.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-BoldSubh.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-Semibold.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-Capt.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd kbdWarnockPro-SemiboldCapt.otf&nbsp;&nbsp;

If it's CS5 you may want to empty the trash. Did you have to enter your serial while installing CS6? <comment57400> 5 is opening and I didn't had to enter a serial for CS6 since it's a trial... <comment57404> Aren't those uninstallers for Adobe software (Flash, Air, CS...) always installed during the original installation? <comment57406> They are - however, I like to always go get the latest uninstaller. I'm notorious for _not updating_ the software and on occasion the uninstaller you have can be out of date or incomplete (or have a bug). In this case, another uninstaller / cleaner has been run, so who knows what is left. The uninstaller should be a unified item - cleaned at the end, but grabbing one removes all doubt whether you have a working tool to clean things up. <comment57407> If I do a clean install and bring my user account back with the Migration Assistant, won't the Adobe files be copied as well when restoring? <comment57409> Just user library caches and plug ins. These are fairly easy to see, harmless without the new software installed, and the new software will likely overwrite or ignore these files. <comment57412> So, I just move migrate the entire user? Don't really know what you mean. <comment57414> On step 8 - only select the user account to migrate. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4413 <comment57755> Ok, great! I'll try it! Thanks!
