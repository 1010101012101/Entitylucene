iPhone 6s not displaying names on text messages <body> I have a brand new iPhone 6s which suddenly stopped displaying names on text messages after I downloaded iOS 9.3. Any new ideas?  <answer232187> ol liGo to Settings-Messages/li liScroll down to the header SMS/MMS/li liUncheck "MMS Messaging"/li liRestart iPhone/li liGo back to "MMS Messaging" and turn it on/li /ol  This should fix the problem  Edit: This bug has been reported to Apple by many users under bug ID 22817380  <answer265342> I tried the answer above but that didn't work for me. After some trial and error turning off contacts in iCloud and then turning them back on worked for me.   ol liGo to settings  iCloud/li liTurn off "Contacts" option/li liIt will ask you if you want to delete the contacts synced on the phone or keep them. I deleted them./li liVerify that the contacts are gone. (Optional)/li liGo back to the iCloud settings and turn the contacts on. /li /ol  This worked for me. Took about a minute for all contacts to resolve in Messages app. I am on iOS 10.2 and this happened when my phone turned off unexpectedly due to battery issues.  <comment283639> I've presumed you're on iOS 9.3 — please edit if this is incorrect. Furthermore, saying you've ‘tried many things’ doesn't help unless you state exactly what you've tried. <comment283675> Wonderful - thanks! <comment337354> I found that editing any contact from the messages app also reloads the contacts if all of the contacts are linked but names aren't showing. But I think you actually have to make a modification to the contact not just hit edit and save.
