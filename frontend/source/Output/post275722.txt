How to find in one sheet in Numbers? <body> When I try to search something in Numbers, it will find in all sheets. Is it possible to search in currently selected sheet only?  MacBook Air macOS Sierra 10.12.3, Numbers 4.0.5  <answer277679> Open the sheet and use Find &amp; Replace.  Command-F or Edit - Find - Find...   For emmost/em Apple productivity apps, Command-F can be used to find text in that app.  <comment346886> Hi Nick, welcome to Ask Different. Unfortunately, your question as it currently reads, is going to be difficult to answer. For example, we have no idea whether you're asking about Numbers on a Mac, on an iPad, etc? Could you edit the question and provide more details, including versions of the OS as well as Numbers, and anything else that may assist. <comment346890> Thanks for your reminder. I've updated the info. I hope this may make my question clearer. <comment349721> Thanks for your answer. I knew `cmd-f` could search. The problem is, this search will search in all my sheets. Since the data is quite large, I would like to narrow down to a specific sheet ONLL, not all sheets. <comment349722> By the way, Excel default search on the current sheet.
