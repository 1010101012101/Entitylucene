How can I change the command key to be the ctrl key for tmux. It's already mapped for other apps) <body> tmux wants me to press kbdCommand/kbd+kbdA/kbd (or kbdCommand/kbd+kbdB/kbd by default, changed it by having codeset -g prefix C-a/code in my .tmux_conf file).  I have already switched kbdControl/kbd and kbdCommand/kbd, so, in general, kbdControl/kbd+kbdC/kbd will now do kbdCommand/kbd+kbdC/kbd, etc.  So how can I make tmux also use kbdControl/kbd instead of kbdCommand/kbd ?   <answer56034> How did you switch codecontrol/code and codecommand/code ? Did you use the "Modifier keys" tab from System Preferences  Keyboard ? By doing so, your keys will be switched on all the apps. I'm not sure this is exactly what you're looking for, if no please let me know.
