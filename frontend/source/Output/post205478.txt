Erasing data from iPhone effects? <body> I am switching phones and am wondering if erasing the data will affect my moms iPhone and iPad which have the same number and email account and iCloud? or will it only affect the one device? please get back to me asap  <comment247742> When you say erase data, what do you mean exactly?  Are you meaning Settings  General  reset?  Or something else? <comment247782> I mean when i hit reset and than i go to "erase content and settings" <comment247783> That will not erase the other phone, if find my iPhone is turned on, turn it off first... You will need to enter the appleids password to do so.   If your new phone is an iPhone don't share appleids.. Get your own, family sharing and parental controls are a better option if either are why you're sharing one now. <comment247784> so erasing it will definitely not affect my moms email account her number and iCloud account (because the iPhone I'm witching to used to be hers?) <comment247785> Resetting the iPhone does not erase anything in iCloud, as far as phone numbers that's controlled by what sim is in the phone.
