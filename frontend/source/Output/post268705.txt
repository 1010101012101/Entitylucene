Write into a NTFS Hard Disk <body> How I can write into a HTFS Hard Disk in macOS Sierra?  I write this line of text in the file codefstab/code          LABEL=device-name  none    ntfs    rw,auto,nobrowse      The codefstab/code file is located in /etc directory.  The codefstab/code file does not exist, but there is a codefstab.hd/code file.  When I finished, the Mac does not see the hard drive, but when I go to the directory of the codeVolume/code, I see a temporary directory with the name of the hard drive and a prohibition sign and then disappears
