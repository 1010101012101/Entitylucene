What inputs does an iPad have? <body> What possible ways of reading input does an iPad have? Right now I can think of:  ul liTouch screen (multitouch I believe?) /li liCamera /li liBrightness adjuster (How does that work? Could it be used for anything other than the brightness adjustment?)/li liOrientation detector /li liThe standard input buttons/li /ul  Is there anything I'm missing?  <answer93343> Besides the obvious strongUSB / Lightning connector/strong and the strongWiFi / Cellular / Bluetooth/strong technology, the iPad has:  ul liVolume up / down switch/li liSilent / Screen rotation lock/li liMicrophone/li liBuilt-in speaker/li liThe emgyroscope/em/li liThe emaccelerometer/em/li liThe ambient light sensor/li liMicro-SIM card try/li liFacetime / iSight camera/li liMulti-Touch display/li /ul  Bear in mind that these are for the latest version.   <comment109498> There is also the GPS on the Cellular version.
