MacMini is unable to communicate with devices on netwrok <body> Devices:  ul liRouter: 192.168.0.1/li liMacMini 192.168.0.97/li liMacBook 192.168.0.19/li liPrinter 192.168.0.99/li liWindows 192.168.0.49/li /ul  So, my problem is that a strange one.  All my devices are connected to the same router.  Here are the Ping Results.  ul liRouter - MacMini: Response/li liRouter - MacBook: Response/li liRouter - Printer: Response/li liRouter - Windows: No Response/li liMacMini - Router: Response/li liMacMini - Windows: No response/li liMacMini - Printer: No Response/li liManMini - MacBook: Response/li liWindows - Router: Response/li liWindows - MacMini: No Response/li liWindows - MacBook: Response/li liWindows - Printer: No Response/li liMacBook - Router: Response/li liMacBook - Printer: Response/li liMacBook - MacMini: Response/li liMacBook - Windows: No Response./li /ul  Basically, my ping results are all over the place. Some devices can connect to others, but no vise versa.  All devices can ping the router, but the Router cannot ping all devices.  I have no idea what is going on here, and I'm not even sure where to begin.  I hope I've provided enough information, please let me know if I need to give more.  <comment220124> Have you power cycled all the devices and disabled all firewalls and then tested? <comment220125> Yes I have. This all started because the MacMini lost connectivity to the Printer. Now I've discovered so many communication breaks in my network. (Everything can access the web online) <comment220308> Can you give us the model and make of your router? <comment220517> It's an asus ac68u running shibby tomato
