Too strict permissions checking in Mac OS <body> After long debugging, I found why I can not login to my MacOS machine with ssh:  precodeAuthentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory /Users/myuser/projects /code/pre  The problem is that I track my code.ssh/code config directory in a git repo, and I link to it in my home directory. It seems that MacOS, as opposed to Linux, does check that all parent directories emof the linked repo/em have strict permissions. And this even though the repo itself has the right permissions:  precodeÂ» ls -ld /home/myuser/projects/homedir/dotfiles/.ssh drwx------ 2 myuser myuser 4096 Feb 14 07:47 /home/myuser/projects/homedir/dotfiles/.ssh /code/pre  Is it possible to disable this checking in MacOS? I have a single directory structure which I rsync around to my machines, and having to change this because of this MacOs limitation is a pain.  <comment343173> If any of the higher level directories are writable by other users than your own, I think macos has the right approach here. For changes in those directories may well have the side effect of changing the target of the symlink. If they're merely readable and/or executable by other users, that seems unnecessarily strict. You might be able to set up a hook to copy the files into a proper `~/.ssh` directory on a `git pull`, though? <comment343196> @HaraldHanche-Olsen probably you are right, that permissions should be only read for group, even for parent directories. The question is then why does linux do not behave the same way? <comment343204> On Linux, the check is the same. It is [in OpenSSH](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/2f2ffa4fbe4b671bbffa0611f15ba44cff64d58e/auth.c#L528).
