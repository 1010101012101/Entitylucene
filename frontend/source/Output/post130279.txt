To play videos of Kindle reader in OSX? <body> My kindle program says that the current Kindle Reader does not support videos. Kindle fire plays them at least. I am not sure if iPad does so.  strongWhich devices are supported by the videos of Kindle?/strong  <answer130281> Kindle for Mac is specifically for reading Kindle books, and doesn't handle any other media.  On iOS, the same is available through the Kindle app.  Amazon Cloud Player for Mac is for music purchased in the MP3 store.  Again, there is an Amazon Cloud Player app for iOS as well.  On your Mac, Amazon Instant Video is available through the Amazon website itself.  If you have video in your library, you can access it through Your Video Library.  In general, though, any video you have rights to view (e.g. with Prime Instant Video), you can access by finding it on Amazon's website.  On iOS devices, you can use the Amazon Instant Video app, which also supports AirPlay for playback on an Apple TV (though Amazon does not actually have native video support on Apple TV.)  <comment152647> so to the question, which apple devices will play kindle video? <comment152651> @Buscar Thanks for the pointer, edited.  The question is a bit hard to parse so I missed that detail the first time, as it seemed the asker's original question was more about how he could play Amazon videos on his Mac.
