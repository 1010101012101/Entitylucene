How do I stop folders automatically opening on my MacBook Pro 2014? <body> When I try to move a file into a folder, let's say Folder A, from another folder, let's say Desktop, how can I stop Folder A automatically opening.   I only want to move the file into it, not see the contents.     strongIs there a way to stop this?/strong  I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.5.  <answer293565> The feature you're referring to is called Spring Loaded Folders. Folders should only spring open if you hover (or pause) over a folder for a second or so (depending on your settings).   In other words, if you drag and drop files from your Desktop into Folder A you would let go of the mouse button as soon as your pointer is over Folder A, rather than pausing over it for too long.  You can adjust your settings as follows:  ol liGo to System Preferences  Accessibility/li liIn the left-hand sidebar, find and select the emMouse &amp; Trackpad/em option./li liNow use the slider to adjust the Spring-loaded delay time./li /ol  strongNOTE:/strong If you wish to disable the Spring-loaded folder feature, you can remove the checkmark next to the slider.
