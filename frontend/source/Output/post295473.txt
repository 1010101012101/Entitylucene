Migration Assistant failing with strange password issue <body> One of my bread and butter jobs for clients is replacing bad/old disks in their Macs. I have a standard procedure:  ol liInstall new hard disk/li liInstall latest possible OS and create account called "Admin"/li liUsing Admin, do all updates./li liFrom Admin account and using old disk as an external, use Migration Assistant./li /ol  In all the years that I've done this, I've never had a problem with the process. At the end of the process, I would see the Admin account that I created (so I didn't have to ask the client for their password) and the user's account(s). Worked like a charm, every time.  Until this one.  I did the same procedure as listed above, but at the end of the Migration process, before rebooting I see the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G6bGN.jpg" alt="administrator password prompt"  The password I used several times embefore/em the Migration isn't working. I tried several variations based on different keyboard layouts. I also booted into recovery mode and Very. Carefully. reset the password. Still no luck. I did that again and changed it to "55555" thinking that it would be very hard to mess that up or be affected by keyboard layout issues. No dice.  Last night, I started from scratch: erased the new disk, installed OS, performed updates and let the migration go during the night.  When I woke, same result.  Does anyone have emany/em idea what this could be and what I could try?  <comment373178> To finish the job, I just erased, re-installed, manually created the user account and copied the data folder by folder, thereby losing the benefits of Migration Assistant. But at least client can log in! <comment373181> I wonder if you remove the /var/db/.AppleSetupDone file in single user mode and then reboot would that let you create a new admin account with a known password that would allow you to bypass this issue? Not sure, just a thought... <comment373194> good thought, thanks. I'll try that next time, but I've worked around the problem for this time.
