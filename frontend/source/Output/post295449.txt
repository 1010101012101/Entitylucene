USB-C to HDMI adapter connect with DisplayPort <body> I have a Macbook Pro 13" 2017 ( no touch bar ) and an external display Dell2214H  I bought an USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter but did not notice that Dell2214H only has DisplayPort. That so, I have to buy another HDMI to DisplayPort adapter, but the display does not work when I connect to my MBP.  I'm not sure it is because of the setup ( USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter - HDMI cab - DisplayPort adapter - external Display ) does not work or not.  There is no USB-C to DisplayPort in Apple site, maybe MBP 2017 cannot output to DisplayPort? What should I do next to make my Dell display work?  Note:   ul liI tried my MBP with USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter and it works correctly. But the display quality is not really good, that why I want to make it work with DisplayPort/li liI checked the version of Adapter driver, it is the latest version ( 2.33 ) already./li liDell2214H display/li /ul  <answer295461> To get the best results I would recommend using the following :   s  ul liThunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 adapter Link/li liMini-DP to DisplayPort Cable to the monitor Link /s/li /ul  Probably this one might work https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-DisplayPort-1-8m-Chromebook-Thunderbolt/dp/B01EXKDRAC  Hope it helps!  <comment373140> You are doing *two* conversions of the video signal.
