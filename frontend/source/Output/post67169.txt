Why does Mail open when I close a calendar notification? <body> I've noticed that when I get a calendar notification (alert) and close it in Mountain Lion, the OS X Mail application opens automatically. I don't use Mail and I have Mail notifications turned off in notification settings, yet it still happens.  What pops up is a screen basically trying to take me through the configuration of Mail, which I'm not interested in.  Any ideas why Mail insists on opening on its own?
