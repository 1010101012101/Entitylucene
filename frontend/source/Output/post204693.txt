AirPort network disappears when nobody is connected <body> I use AirPort Express to create a WiFi network. Provider gives me static IP and uses binding to MAC-address (AirPort Express has two MACs -- for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, I guess, -- and I gave provider one of them, unfortunately, don't remember which one). Firstly, router says there's a double NAT problem, but I "ignored" it and everything goes well. But the real problem is when no device is using the internet, router just falls to some kind of sleeping mode: MacBook and iMac can see the network, but cannot connect to internet (there is an exclamation mark on the wifi icon), iOS-devices don't see the network at all, and AirPort Utility doesn't see router too. DHCP lease time is 1 day, but few minutes are enough to "brake" the router. Only rebooting can get router back from this sleeping mode.   I've tried to change "DCHP and NAT" to "DHCP" only, but the problem is still here, so I have to reboot it several times a day.   How can I fix it?
