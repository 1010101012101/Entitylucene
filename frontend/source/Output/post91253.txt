Alternative Large Cursors <body> I need to use large cursors when using OSX.  However the standard Apple ones I can choose in System Preferences all make the cursor expand to the right and down. These then hide the beginning of any tooltip (especially in web browsers).  I already use OmniDazzle to be able to find the cursor (and have used Pinpoint in the past) - it highlights the area the cursor is in but it does not change the cursor icon so it does not help me.  Are there any cursors or any way to expand the cursor in other directions so I can still read the tooltips?  <answer91468> You can make custom cursors with a graphics program and apply them using Pinpoint. Here's the relevant video on how it's done.   <answer91753> I think Mouseposé or PinPoint will help you out by providing a  highlight around a normal size cursor that isn't opaque like the normal cursor so you can still read the tooltips.  They're not free, but it may be your only option.  <comment107418> I have a similar problem, check out this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/36654/15568 Its not a great solution, more of an alternative to scaling up the cursor <comment107427> It looks (from the video) like the default cursor has to stay visible. Perhaps the cursor set to its small size in addition to a custom icon would be a satisfactory solution. <comment107428> I'm playing with the trial now and indeed the default cursor stays visible. However, the custom setting allow for vertical and horizontal offset of the custom icon relative to the default cursor. <comment107451> @OrangeBox I use OmniDazzle for when I have looked away <comment107457> Pinpoit FAQ says "PinPoint does not change the actual pointer in any way. This requires overriding Mac OS X and is not encouraged by Apple. Therefore, we do not do this. PinPoint adds to the existing pointer but does not replace it." <comment107458> and their web pages are odd, can't select text and videos don't work for me. <comment107500> Sorry it won't work for you. I agree it's a weird app but I think it's intended mainly for presentations. As you discovered, short of hacking the OS your options are limited. <comment107501> The downvote however I feel is undeserved. <comment107578> The downvote is because as far as I can see it does not chnage the cursor which is the question - the FAQ explicitly says it does not, If you know otherwise please show <comment107707> → Mark: I'd like to add here another closely related wish. Most of the time, when a human reads, his eyes focus progress toward the right & down (in occidental writing habits). And on this path, the tooltips are always hiding the next text to read.    *How may we place these tooltips on the left and up corner (relative to the actual cursor position) so as to avoid hiding the text we are just trying to read?* <comment107967> @Mark, the short answer is no.  Apple has fully locked down the cursors.  The best you can do is something like Mouseposé which puts a big translucent cursor-like image around the cursor, in effect giving you a big cursor without actually replacing the cursor.  Then you could use normal size cursor and still read the tooltips through the added highlights. <comment107988> What OS X do you have ?? In 10.8 the cursor changes size by increasing in size with the slider in System PreferencesAccessibilityDisplay and there is a slider to change the size. I don't know what you mean by Down and Right as this just gets Bigger <comment107989> It gets biggrt but the active point is the tip of the arrow whhic is at the upper left - so the extenstion is down and right not equally
