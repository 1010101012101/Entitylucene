How can I have my shell always start in a certain directory that is not my home directory <body> I've tried putting  precodecd /Users/my_name/my_directory/structure /code/pre  in both code.bashrc/code and code.bash_login/code but neither works, i.e. when I open a new terminal window I am in my home (/Users/my_name/) directory.  No error messages, just not cd'd into the directory as hoped when starting a new terminal window.  <answer62506> First of all, if you are not using iTerm2 already, I suggest you download this free software as a replacement for Terminal.app.  Among many other extra features, in iTerm Preferences, you can configure the default working directory for new shells. You'll find these settings in Profiles - General.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zl10J.png" alt="iTerm Default Working Directory"  The advantage here is that you can set different behaviors for opening a new window vs opening a new tab or even creating a new split pane. I personally like staying in the current working directory when adding a split pane, for example.  You could do it in your startup script as well (though I find the iTerm solution cleaner, or at least more flexible), but then I advise you to use code~/.bash_profile/code instead.  code~/.bashrc/code is strongnot/strong automatically sourced when opening a new shell window, and code~/.bash_login/code is only sourced if no code~/.bash_profile/code is present.  <answer62594> As Gerry mentioned, code.bashrc/code is not read by login shells. New tabs are login shells by default in Terminal and iTerm 2. code.bash_login/code is only read if there's no code.bash_profile/code.  You could also add a codecd/code command to code.bash_profile/code.  <comment72259> I always source my .bashrc from my .bash_profile so I don't have to remember which is called from where. <comment72260> @CajunLuke I do something quite similar: https://github.com/gerryvdm/dotfiles <comment275595> If modifying Working Directory’s “Directory” field has no effect, you probably need to switch Command from “Command” to “Login shell” ([source](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/iterm2-discuss/pkbJJ9MwJNo/KKjkqihneZ4J)).
