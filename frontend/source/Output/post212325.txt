Hiding finder preview panel... forever <body> I'm not sure why but quite recently Finder likes to show me the Preview panel on new Finder windows.   I've tried every method I could find:  ul liHiding the preview. Close the finder and open a new window. Will show the same preview again./li liGo to code/Users/$username$/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code and edit the codeShowPreviewPane/code setting it to codeNO/code. This will magically revert to codeYES/code after I relaunch the Finder./li /ul  I'm out of ideas. What could I do?  <answer212377> Finder-View Menu-Hide Preview.  <answer227540> This worked for me:  ol liOpen Finder and close preview pane,/li liPress kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdJ/kbd (or select in menu: View-Show view options), select needed options and press "Set as default" button./li /ol  <answer228655> I found I had the same issue.  Coda, a text editing app, had a lock on the file.  Once I went into Coda's preferences and released the file to Text Editor, my changes to the com.apple.finder.plist file reset.  It's safe to delete the file.  OS X will automatically create a new file shortly after the old file has been deleted.  <answer229035> From the Menubar  View  Select Hide Preview  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UWHgm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer243656> Open Terminal  precodecd /Users/$username$/Library/Preferences/  sudo mv com.apple.finder.plist com.apple.finder.plist.GO.AWAY /code/pre  On the desktop: Finder-Apple-Force Quit-Relaunch Finder  Check the preview pane (pain) is now gone.  Back to terminal:  precodesudo chmod 444 com.apple.finder.plist /code/pre  <answer271003> I tried deleting library/preferences/com.apple.finder.plist but it had no effect.  Neither did changing "Hide Preview" in Finder's View menu.  But -- drum roll please -- with the finder window open showing the preview pane, I used the key combo shift-command-P and the pane disappeared from the open window, AND FROM ALL NEW FINDER WINDOWS I OPENED!  Persistence pays!  <comment256372> There is no string `ShowPreviewPane ` in my finder.plist I do see `PreviewPaneVisibility` for each window, but no global control. It may depend on what your default for New Finder Window is set to - or which OS you're on. Need more info. <comment256373> I'm on El Capitan, latest version from yesterday (10.11.1) <comment256447> Already did that and that didn't work. <comment279360> OP says he hides preview in the question <comment306360> And how do you do it system wide. Every time I start Finder have to do it over again.
