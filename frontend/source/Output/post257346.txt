Convert audio files (stereo to mono) files on-air during transfer, not locally? <body> This is not very common question. My goal is to have mono files on my iPhone.  I know about possibility to make "converted duplicates" of my audio files in my iTunes library. I tried that want and I took me a lot of time to search and identify mono from stereo files and THEN to send them to iPhone.  Is there possibility to convert them during syncing with iPhone or iPod? That would make everything easier for me.  Switching to "Mono" in settings strongdoesn't/strong interest me at all.
