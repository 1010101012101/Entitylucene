Watch video or play games on two external monitors <body> I have a 2013 15inch retina MacBook Pro and two Dell U2414H as external monitors. I want to watch video or play games like the image in this question. For the current mac system, I can only achieve two individual external monitors not like the dual monitors. I tried to install Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro, and it can become the dual monitors. However, when I tried to play some video, it can only be displayed on one monitors. Can anyone help me with the issue?  <comment148226> Have You tried to disable “Displays have separate Spaces” in Mission Control pref pane? <comment150372> Which cable you use to connect the monitor? I have same mac and monitor, but don't work with DP-miniDP cable. <comment150881> @MateuszSzlosek yes, I tried that. It gives me two same display (mirror) for my two external monitors. <comment150882> @Kit I bought an extra dp to dp cable, and it works but not the way I want.
