iOS 8 - Personal Hotspot - Works on iPad, Fails on rMBP <body> The question kind of says it all. I have an iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 8.1 (not yet 8.1.1).  Connecting to this iPhone with my iPad Air 2 through personal hotspot works just fine (I'm actually using that connection to write this question).  I'm sitting right next to the phone and my mid-2013 15" rMBP sees the network and connects to the network, but can't get an IP address.  At first, I get a funky self-assigned IPv6 address, but then it reverts to the standard 169.xxx.xxx.xxx self-assigned IPv4 address.  My rMBP is running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 (14B23).  My next steps are to update both my iOS and my OS X, but I'm busy with work and that's not terribly convenient at the moment. Anybody know how to fix this?  <comment185289> So, it was not a convenient thing to try, but I did a reboot. Personal hotspot worked on my rMBP after that. This seems to be a fairly common failure for me, though. I'd like to know the actual cause of the problem.
