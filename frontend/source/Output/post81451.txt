How long did it take to create iOS? <body> Hello. I want to know how many years Apple Inc took to create the iOS Platform for mobile?  <answer81452> Steve Jobs said it's five years ahead of its competitor when it released.  <comment93911> Since iOS was not developed from scratch but instead was built upon customizing/optimizing OS X (which in turn consists of Mach kernel, BSD, Core Foundation, etc) to run on the ARM architecture, you need to be more specific on  from which point when you do starting counting the years? <comment93969> Wen you consider that the competition was Windows mobile 6.5 it isn't that far of a stretch to say that iOS was 5 years ahead. The problem is Apple stopped innovating after the initial release
