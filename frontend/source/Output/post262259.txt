How to disable Command+Shift+R? <body> I have been using command+shift+R in Sublime Text forever (super+shift+R in Sublime). On my iMac all that happens is that I hear a beep (on Sierra).  It is really annoying and I can't find a way to remove the shortcut or remap it. Anything I've tried so far hasn't yielded any results.  Karabiner isn't working in Sierra and I tried some other app BetterTouchTool that doesn't seem to help either.  Is there a way to force my Mac to unbind that shortcut?  <answer262260> A beep indicates that the shortcut that was pressed was not interpreted by apps on the system. This means the shortcut is emalready/em unbound, so it seems you're having some problem with SublimeÂ Text itself rather than the shortcut being bound to something else.  <answer262267> systempreferences-keyboard-shortcuts-appshortcuts: add sublime with the +  <comment328526> If it beeps, it is unbound <comment329155> You were right! It was another application that stole it.
