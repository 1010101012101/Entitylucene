How to get everything from terminal mail(1) sent to my email address? <body> I'd like to be notified by email whenever a message gets sent to my terminal mail, how could I achieve this?  I see some information about cc'ing in this documentation, but I don't know how to use it in this regard.  <answer117491> I assume you are referring to the notice that comes up in Terminal "You've got mail"  ol liCreate a file .forward in your home directory.  (that's a period and the word forward with no space.  In it write the address you want the mail forwarded to.  This file has to be owned and readable by your userid.  /li liJobs run by cron by default mail their output to the owner of the crontab file.  This can be overridden by specifying the option MAILTO=userid@somewhere.com at the top of the file.  See man crontab for details./li /ol  The second only forwards the details of jobs run from that particular crontab. If you have sandboxed services that have individual crontabs on a user basis (E.g. You have a database service that runs a consitency check on the database at 2:30 every morning, and runs that service as user mysql, then you have to add the line to mysql's crontab.   General best practice for email that goes to non-real users is to forward it to a role first.  E.g. All the machines in your network send their system email to sysadmin@mydomain.com  Then on a central server you forward sysadmin's mail to a real person.  This makes it much easier at vacation time to temporarily forward email to your temp sysadmin.  <comment137934> Hi, are these two different methods or are they both necessary?
