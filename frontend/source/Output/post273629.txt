Storyboard unresponsive in new Xcode update (8.2.1) <body> I updated Xcode and now my storyboard will not load at all. It pretty much crashes my Xcode until I have to Force Quit out. When I start my Xcode over, I can quickly click into a file but if I try to go back into my storyboard - the same thing happens and Xcode completely freezes. It only started happening when I updated to the new Xcode(8.2.1) .  How can I figure out if my storyboard file is corrupt or if Xcode needs to be reinstalled?
