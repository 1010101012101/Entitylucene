Apple Mail not downloading attachments <body> I am using macOS Sierra. Recently, the Mail app started having problems with attachments. On many (but not all) messages, attachments show up, but they are displayed as "Mail Attachment", not as the actual file name. Curiously, sometimes the correct icon shows up. I thought that maybe they needed some time to download, but waiting for hours does not solve it. I tried turning on and off the automatic attachment download and deleting the Mail Downloads directory, but that did not fix it.  This is an Exchange account, which may be part of the problem.  Any idea what could be causing this?  <answer263743> Disabling "enable junk mail filtering" fixed it for me (Mail Preferences). I tried everything, this fixed it as a last ditch attempt before only using my phone as the goto device.  <comment330585> Junk email filtering was already disabled for me.
