Dual monitor on Macbook Pro Retina: difference between 13 and 15 inches? <body> Can the HD 4000 of the Macbook Pro Retina 13 easily handle 2 monitor at 1920x1080 or would it be better to buy a Macbook Pro Retina 15 because it has a separate GPU ? At the Macbook Retina's release, I heard it had some scrolling issues because of the large resolution it had to deal with and I do not want to experience that on external displays. I plan to plug the 2 monitors on the 2 thunderbolt ports.  <answer85101> HT5219 Thunderbolt ports and displays: Frequently asked questions (FAQ) says the 13" Retina Macbook Pro will happily run with two Thunderbolt displays.  Although I have not used it first hand, I would not expect you to have performance issues running the two extra displays. The main retina display is actually drawing 4 times as many pixels as the external displays, and then scaling the image down, so a Thunderbolt display is not going to make much of a difference.  As to the scrolling performance, I believe that was fixed in a software update
