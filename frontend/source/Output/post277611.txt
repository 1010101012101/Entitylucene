iMac 27-inch late 2015 upgrade RAM with higher frequency <body> My current RAM memory has 1867Mhz and I want to upgrade with 2133Mhz.   Can this cause any problems?  The RAM is compatible with my iMac, at least the manufacturer says so.  <answer277614> If you mix 2133 with 1866 it will all run at 1866.  ol liReplace all memory sticks with DDR3 2133MHz/li liUse quality components (Crucial, Kingston) or you may encounter freezing issues/li /ol  <comment349382> So it doesn't affect at all some components of the machine or the system perfomance? <comment349386> And what if the memory which I want to add has lower frequency more exactly 1600MHz? It does affect with something?
