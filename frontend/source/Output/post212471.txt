Double Whatsapp Backup in iCloud <body> I am not sure if this is the case, but when you do strongiCloud/strong Backup of your phone, it will backup Whatsapp. ( I am unsure if this include the Photos and Video )   Then Whatsapp itself has backup option to backup itself in strongiCloud Drive/strong Backup.   Is that a double Backup? Because i see 2.1GB inside the iCloud Backup, and then 1.7Gb inside document and settings.  <answer213776> Yes, if you let both options enabled, your iCloud storage will have two WhatsApp backups.  More information: http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/iphone/20888066  <answer248065> Yes, if you have device backup and whatsapp chat backup turned on, you will indeed be making two backups for whatsapp. My my case, this means 2 x 1.5GB.  The following strongemunofficial/em/strong info should help you make a decision on whether to keep both, or turn one of them off. Disclosure, this is not my info, I did find it elsewhere:     The iCloud backup and having the device backup does duplicate data.   Backing up the phone will back up whatsapp, so if you restored to a   new phone even without enabling the inbuilt backup your data would be   there.      If you enable the whatsapp iCloud backup you are able to restore your   data to a new phone, without performing a full iCloud restore.   Personally I would keep the in built whatsapp backup enabled and   untick it from the complete iPhone backup. I swap my backup often   between my two phones using just the built in whatsapp feature,   without restoring etc.   Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/3pz8hh/how_does_the_whatsapp_app_backup_work/  <comment306148> The link you provided is about WhatsApp backups but does not actually mention anything about the double backup issues. However, this unofficial thread seems to give the info we need: https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/3pz8hh/how_does_the_whatsapp_app_backup_work/ I have created an answer with this info in case it helps. <comment307555> Thanks, I got the answer myself long ago. But it was nice that you answered anyway. Just a side note. Turning on iCloud Backup in Whatsapp will causes your iCloud on Mac to constantly take up all your bandwidth. ( It will keep download the Whatsapp iCloud in a loop ). This is a bug that I have reported long ago and no yet fixed. <comment330727> I really wonder that this is not discussed more often. I came here because on my girlfriend's iPhone the iCloud space Apple provides free of charge, currently 5GB, was full and a backup was no longer possible. Half of it was taken by the photo library and the other half by WhatsApp. Reducing that is makes a big difference.
