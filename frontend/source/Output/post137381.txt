Mid 2011 imac 27" with new hard drive keeps shutting down randomly <body> Mid 2011 imac 27" with new hard drive keeps shutting down randomly.  After a bad crash, the imac can no longer boot into desktop. I seem to have a stuck booting cycle with the horizontal progress bar progressing then reverting back to the spinning progress circle but never reaching desktop.  I can boot via an external hard drive with a system on and tried to backup the problem drive with superduper. But halfway through backing up the imac randomly shut down. I then restarted using the my external drive and backed up files manuallly.  I also tried installing mavericks on to the problem drive, but the install freezes at the end of the mavericks restart message.  Do you think I have a defective new hard drive? Or do you think it's another issue with the imac?  I may try another option of formatting the problem drive and reinstalling a completely clean system on to the drive.  <comment163241> did you try the fsck in terminal to see if it can fix the drive. <comment163243> Not tried fsck, I will give it a go. <comment163549> Fsck did't work. Have formatted drive, but can't seem to reinstall any system.
