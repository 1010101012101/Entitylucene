How to change the default application for WEBLOC files? <body> On macOS Sierra, I am encountering a strange behaviour of WEBLOC files. In the emOpen with:/em section of the emInfo/em window, the drop down list for choosing the default application is greyed out. It is set to Safari even though I have chosen a different default web browser in the System Preferences. I would like to change it to the browser of my choice, but it appears I am stuck with Safari.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HM03z.png" alt="App drop down greyed out in Info window"  When I select more than one WEBLOC file at once, the drop down list stops being greyed out. But when I try selecting a different browser, I get the following error message:     strongYou can’t change the item “Ask Different.webloc” to always open in the selected application./strong      The item is either locked or damaged, or in a folder you don’t have permission to modify (error code -10823).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgNAK.png" alt="Error message while trying to choose a different default application for WEBLOC files"  Needless to say that this particular WEBLOC file is neither locked nor damaged and that I have all the required permissions for the containing folder and the file.  How can I change the default application for WEBLOC files so they open with the browser of my choice?  <answer258034> I have found a solution:  ol liMake sure that the Finder is set to show all filename extensions (Finder Preferences → Advanced)./li liEdit the file name by deleting the “.webloc” filename extension./li liShow Info: Lo and behold – the application drop down list is no longer greyed out. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9jq9A.png" alt="Application list no longer greyed out after deleting &quot;.webloc&quot; filename extension"/li liSelect the browser of your choice and press the emChange All…/em button./li liThe default application for opening any WEBLOC file has been changed, whether or not it has the explicit “.webloc” filename extension./li /ol  <comment333403> this seems to change the default application listed in "Get Info..." but doesn't actually change the application that opens when you click on the file... <comment335691> This worked for me. The icon is still showing Safari, but when I double click it opens it in Firefox. Hopefully it'll stay this way.
