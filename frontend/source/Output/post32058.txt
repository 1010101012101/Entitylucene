Does the 2011 Mac Mini work with dual monitors? <body> I want to start development on Mac, and from what I read around, everyone suggests the current Mac Mini. So my question is, does the hardware support dual monitors out of the box?   If not, what should I purchase to get a dual monitor setup working?   <answer32059> http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html     Extended desktop and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports up to 1920 by 1200 pixels on a DVI or VGA display; up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on a strongdual-link DVI/strong display using Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter (sold separately)   <answer32060> Yes - search for the term "two displays" at the marketing page for the Mac Mini.  <answer32063> Yes, I too am a developer using a mid-2011 Mac Mini (with AMD Radeon GPU) connected to two Samsung displays   ul lione display connected using HDMI cable which comes with the Mac Mini, and/li lianother display connected using an Apple DisplayPort to VGA cable which Ibr had to buy separately./li /ul
