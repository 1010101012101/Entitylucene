Can I configure the auto duplex feature of my Canon Pixma printer on Mac OS X? <body> I am trying to configure a printer (Canon Pixma mg3150) to my mac... everything looks fine, I can print a page of 1 side. The specification of the printer shows codeauto duplex print/code, but the codeTwo Sided/code is not permitted from the PDF viewer as follows:  Does anyone know if the printer really permits auto duplex print?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p4Plo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer48918> Go into the system preferences, Print &amp; Scan, click on the printer, and click "Options &amp; Supplies...".  Under the "Driver" tab, check and see if there's some sort of option to turn a duplexer on &amp; off.  <answer113277> Two-side printer setting is located under "Duplex Printing &amp; Margins".  <comment55978> The obvious questions: does duplex printing work in other programs? Do you have the latest drivers? Did you try different presets? <comment55985> Is there a "Paper Handling" choice where we see "Layout" in your picture? <comment55991> Indeed, there is a choice `Duplex Printing & Margin` which responds to my need, thank you very much... <comment132942> No, I think there should be a checkbox labeled "two-sided" next to the copies field. <comment132946> Canon printers seem to have duplex printer options working only under "Duplex Printing & Margins".  This suggestion appears to have worked for SoftTimur.
