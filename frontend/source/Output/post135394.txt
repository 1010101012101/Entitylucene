How To Disable OS X Mavericks USB autorun <body> After inserting USB 3G modem i always getting same behavior:  if bundled software is not installed:  ul liOpening finder window with mounted folder/li liOpening standard installer dialog (agree license, install software that written inside 3G modem)/li /ul  if installed already:  ul liModem-related app is launching/li /ul  Question: how to disable that "autorun" (not exactly windows-style autorun, i know)?  Super-annoying  P.S. Things applied only to OS X Maverick, previous OSX versions don't show same behavior  UPDATE  ul liModem brand is HUAWEI E173/li liPrevious OSX version don't show same behavior/li liFound hidden modem helper, location: code/Library/StartupItems/HWNetMgr/code/li /ul  plist:  precode{   Description     = "HWNetMgr";   Provides        = ("HWNetMgr");   OrderPreference = "Early";   Messages =   {     start = "Starting Huawei HWNetMgr";     stop  = "Stopping Huawei HWNetMgr";   }; } /code/pre  And removed it completely &amp;&amp; rebooted. Results: nothing actually changed. Same behavior as mentioned above. So i thinking it's not related to the modem brand/bundle and in-system property.  <answer135435> The modem sofware emmay/em have a hidden "helper" application that launches on user login. This helper application would wait for the USB modem to be inserted and launch the modem software upon insertion.    Check your LoginItems in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  User  LoginItems.    em(I would have made the above info a comment/question but my rep score only allows answers not comments...)/em   <answer136245> You'll want to check in either:  code/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons//code  This is where software will install its background daemons.  Once you find the plist associated with the vender/software, move the plist file out and reboot.  With any luck, that should be it.  <answer136422> You need to remove the auto launch job with the codelaunchctl/code command.  For example, in my case I have already installed a modem manufactured by ZTE. So I searched for LAUNCHD listings using the codelaunchctl list/code command and grepped for those modem strings.  precodelaunchctl list | grep -i zte /code/pre  Showing:  precode5681    -   cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist /code/pre  If you do not find your app, then output all the jobs to a file. This awk command tries to overcome the chance that you may have spaces in your launchd job name.  precodelaunchctl list 2&gt;/dev/null | awk ' { x="\""substr($0, match($0, $3), 100)"\""; print x; system("launchctl list " x) } ' &gt; launchList.txt /code/pre  Open launchList.txt. The name of the launchd job will be shown in "..." above the {} block where you hopefully find a "Mobile Partner" or "AutoOpen" string.   Perhaps inspect the item to be more confident before removal. Surround by "" if there are spaces in the job name.  precodelaunchctl list "cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist" /code/pre  Then just remove it. This is the command to stop the auto load. Be very sure you are removing the correct agent or deamon.   precodelaunchctl remove "cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist" /code/pre  Add it again if you want, using the full path of the PLIST file.  precodelaunchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist /code/pre  <answer153058> You should remove /Library/StartupItems/HWPortDetect and HWNetMgr, and you might want to delete them from launchctl too.  <answer198523> Delete /Library/LaunchAgents/HWPortCfg.plist and /Library/StartupItems/HWPortDetect and reboot your system.  <comment160677> Just checked, "Login Items" are empty. Also, don't think it's related at all since it works this way now and before even inserting 3G modem first time. Can't find anything suspicious in process list as well (ps aux) <comment161572> Does this behavior exists for every user? <comment161573> What brand of 3G modem do you use? <comment161679> That's great answer, really like it. Thanks a lot, now i know more about system internals. But, still, not related to the question. More like it's built in functionality.  Checked every file there, disabled some. Nothing suspicious, only regular stuff like google updater or mongodb/redis launchers <comment161680> 1) Yes, just created new bare user and still same behavior.   2)Huawei E173 <comment161860> If you still cannot find the Huawei E173 plist deaemon or agent, can you give the name of the Modem-related application which is launched? Are you able to determine the applications process name? <comment161937> Don't have any, betting there are no such thing   `  % sudo launchctl list | grep -i usb  Password:  53 - com.apple.usbmuxd  43 - com.apple.usbd  - 0 com.apple.IOBluetoothUSBDFU  % sudo launchctl list | grep -i zte  % sudo launchctl list | grep -i huawei  %   % ls /Library/LaunchAgents/  com.bjango.istatlocal.plist  com.google.keystone.agent.plist  org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist org.pqrs.PCKeyboardHack.server.plist ` <comment161938> Disabled pgp stuff, not related. Disabled using `move` to different folder + reboot. Again, only `com.apple.*` stuff, nothing more than that (and i thinking it's core system functionality in Mavericks).  `ps aux|grep usb` shows me     * /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileDevice.framework/Versions/A/Resources/usbmuxd -launchd * /usr/libexec/usbd <comment161945> If that helps: In-modem software named "Mobile Partner.app" and (if not installed) after inserting usb modem i seeing this (visually installer dialog): (ps aux) /Volumes/MTS Connect/Mobile Partner.app/Contents/MacOS/AutoOpen -psn_0_557192 <comment161971> So you need to find the launchd job which launches the "Mobile Partner.app". I've edited the answer to explain how. <comment162020> After further investigation found a hidden helper, see post update. And, more over, nothing did changed without that helper installed. Thanks for investigation and great help. Gonna reward you with that bounty - issue is not resolved anyhow but seems like no one knows anything and you provided best possible insight and your answers could be very helpful to other users <comment162026> Well that is the deprecated way of a launch. Read ```man SystemStarter``` to understand if ```/sbin/SystemStarter stop "HWNetMgr"``` works. If so, there is always a way to setup your own launcher to stop the other, read: ```man launchd``` to setup your own "WatchPaths". Lastly check the HUAWEI E173 support site. I see they have a recent 2013 download. <comment236480> This is the correct answer. I found `/Library/StartupItems/HWPortDetect/HWPortCfg` running as a background process and killing it disabled the installer from starting up automatically. <comment236481> `launchctl remove com.huawei.HWPortCfg.plist` removed it permanently. <comment237582> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.

It seems drastic.
