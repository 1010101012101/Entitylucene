Setting up new Apple ID, I keep getting message that password is not complex enough <body> I have chosen a password that has one upper case, lower case and 3 numbers,  but I still keep getting a message that it's not complex enough.  Why?  <answer202806> Here are the guidelines I found on Apple's website. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lGTq9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Hope this helps.  <answer202808> According to Apple's support site     Strong passwords      Apple policy requires you use strong passwords with your Apple ID. Your password must have a minimum of 8 characters, not contain more than 3 consecutive identical characters, and include a number, an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter.   <answer202816> These are the expanded requirements from Apple:  ul liAt least 1 letter/li liAt least 1 capital letter/li liAt least 1 number/li liCannot contain multiple identical consecutive characters/li liCannot be the same as the Apple ID account name/li liA minimum of 8 characters/li liNot a common password/li liNo reuse of old passwords for one year/li /ul  Most people are tripped up by the emmultiple identical consecutive characters/em requirement and the last two requirements in the list. I'm not sure if Apple is also checking for use of all or part of your real name(s) from your account information in your password. Some password systems I've used enforce this additional requirement.  If you have too many passwords in your digital life, consider using a secure password manager like LastPass or 1Password.   codeDisclaimer: satisfied personal and enterprise user of LastPass only./code
