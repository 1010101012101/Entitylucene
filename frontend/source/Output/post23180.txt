Is it safe to downgrade Lion from 10.7.1 to 10.7? <body> h1Questions/h1  Is it OK to downgrade 10.7.1 strongClient/strong to 10.7 using the original version 1.0.4 of Install Mac OS X Lion.app?  Either type of downgrade to be followed by updates.

Following advice from Apple, some users set aside a copy of version 1.0.4.   OS X Lion Update 10.7.1 (Client) and OS X Lion Update 10.7.1 (Server) were posted on 16th August 2011.   Install Mac OS X Lion.app 1.0.8 for Mac OS X (Build 11B26) appeared in the Store on 23rd August. If a copy of 1.0.4 is found, the Store routine may update that copy to 1.0.8.   However:   ul libetween 16th and 23rd August, 1.0.8 was not an option/li lisome users may be unaware of 1.0.8 /li lisome users are aware of 1.0.8 but prefer to retain and reuse 1.0.4 (to install 10.7 instead of 10.7.1, then update)./li /ul  <answer23190> h1Downgrade 10.7.1 (Client) to 10.7/h1  Downgrade is possible, apparently without restriction, but not necessarily OK.   h2My own case/h2  After using 10.7.1 for a few days, a series of events led me to erase my startup volume then use Recovery OS Time Machine to restore from backup. These events left me strongwithout/strong the emRecovery HD/em that is required for FileVault 2.   At that time, version 1.0.8 of the installer was not available.   To regain a Recovery OS:   ol liavoiding my usual account, I used a different account to log in to 10.7.1 (intention: data integrity — avoid my usual home directory at all stages during a downgrade)/li liI ran version 1.0.4 of the installer on 10.7.1 to install (downgrade to) 10.7/li liavoiding my usual account, I used a different account to log in to 10.7/li liI observed an issue affecting a peripheral display — at least one thing strongnot OK/strong/li liI didn't investigate that issue, didn't seek other issues (intention: spend as little time as possible in a downgraded environment)/li liI ran Software Update, got 10.7.1 and other updates./li /ol  h2More generally/h2  strongData/strong relating to the greatest version of an executable may be strongincompatible/strong with, or stronglose integrity/strong with, a lesser version.   Incompatibility or loss of integrity may be acceptable for some types of file (examples: cache files, preference files). For other types (example: application support) integrity may be critical.   For the System version/build over which you wish to reinstall, if Apple provides a matching strongfull installer/strong:   ul liavoid downgrade — prefer to install a strongmatching/strong system. /li /ul  h3Application-specific formats that are designed for export and import/h3  To minimise the risks associated with downgrades, I guess that:   ul lian archive produced by Address Book in 10.7.1 should be usable without issue in 10.7 /li lian archive produced by iCal in 10.7.1 should be usable without issue in 10.7/li /ul  – and so on.   <answer34566> A sure-proof way to ensure nothing wrong happens would to be first do a downgrade to Snow Leopard, if you still have the install/recovery disk (and you don't, borrow or buy one), and then reinstalling Lion using the backed-up install lion.app.  <comment25865> Side question: what's the problem with 10.7.1 ? <comment41061> How do you get the version 1.0.4 of the installer? <comment41069> 1.0.4 was from the App Store when 10.7 was current. For test and other purposes, I set aside backups of legacy installers. Now from the App Store you will get only the most recent version of the installer, for the most recent version of the OS. <comment74009> @CedricH. as far as I recall, no problem with the *software*. One way of viewing this: no *full installer* for the current version of the software, during which period some users found it necessary to use an outdated installer.
