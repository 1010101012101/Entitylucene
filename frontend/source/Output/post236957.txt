Why El Capitan's ping time so high <body> I upgraded my computer to El Capitan. It is MacBook Retina and late 2013 or early 2014. I did not know what was ping time before, but now it is usually about 23 ms. I have a Lenovo Yoga and a LG Android tablet. Both's ping times are 10 ms even sometimes less, but Mac's ping time is never below 20ms. This is absolutely a Mac's problem. Because my internet is faster on my two other devices.  I am making voice calls from Mac and because of this slow ping time, I sometimes get brakes on my voice calls. Is there anybody knows any trick to make Mac faster in regard of ping time.   Btw, download speeds are almost same on all three devices and I test speed on http://www.speedtest.net/  <comment290090> Have a look [at my answer to this questions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/235739/constantly-dropping-internet-on-el-capitan/235742#235742) and see if turning off the `awdl0` interface helps. <comment290095> If you can ping your router from the Mac, it should be evident if the problem is external to the OS and outside your local network. In almost all cases - the problem is routing traffic past the point where your OS can affect things. <comment290210> thanks a lot bmike. it is very good idea. I just did it. I get times between 1 and 2. so, it is pretty fast. but, when I ping to www.google.com, I get around 60ms. so, there is a thing that slowdown the network. I have an android phone and tablet. both gives me 43ms averagely. I tested tyelford solution, but it does not help
