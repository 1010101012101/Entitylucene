Secondary displays randomly swap content on reconnect <body> I use a 2015 15" MacBook Pro with two external displays in the following approximate physical configuration:  precode+-----------+ |           +------------------------+ |           ||                       | |           ||                       +-----------------+ |           ||                       ||                | |           ||      2 (Primary)      ||                | |     1     ||                       ||   3 (Built-in) | |           ||                       ||                | |           ||                       ||                | |           +------------------------------------------+ |           | |           | |           | +-----------+ /code/pre  Displays 1 and 2 are external, third-party displays. Display 3 is the laptop's built-in display. Display 2 is the primary display — the one with the menu bar in Display preferences' Arrangement tab. Displays 1 and 2 are attached to the laptop with two Mini DisplayPort cables attached to the its two Thunderbolt ports, and are not daisy-chained — they're attached separately.   When I disconnect and reconnect the displays, there's about a 50% chance that the content that was previously on display 1 swaps with the content that was previously on display 3. When this happens, I typically just disconnect and reconnect both displays repeatedly until the content that was on display 1 is shown on display 1, and the content that was on display 3 is on display 3. The content on display 2 never seems to be moved.  How can I configure macOS to keep the arrangement of displays 1 and 3 correct?  hr  Extra info:  ul liMBP model: MacBookPro11,4/li liDisplay 1: Dell U2713HM/li liDisplay 2: Dell U3011/li /ul  Related question, though I don't believe it's a duplicate: Primary display randomly changes  <comment372682> Possibly related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/271690/119271
