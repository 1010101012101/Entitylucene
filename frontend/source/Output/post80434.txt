How to take a full page screenshot in Mac OS Safari? <body> I'm looking for a Safari Extension that can take strongfull page/strong screenshots. I am aware there are various extensions, but haven't found any that would take full page images.  <answer80437> sMaybe/s strongDon't/strong give http://awesomescreenshot.com/ a try, strongsee disclaimer below. There are better options available, see other answers to this question./strong Awesome Screenshot is a browser plugin that can capture  ul lithe full site/li lithe visible part emor/em /li lia selection of the site. /li /ul  It also allows for basic annotation of the screenshot as well as downloading it or saving it on the web for access by URL. Available as extension to Safari, Firefox and Chrome.  strongDISCLAIMER: there are strong indications that Awesome Screenshot sends information about your browser history to third party servers. I would emnot/em recommend this after all. It also has a history of integrating adware in it's extension and then apologizing for it afterwards./strong  <answer80449> I am not aware of any Safari Extensions which can do this, but Skitch can also do this.  <answer80526> Try Jing. It is not a Safari extension, but it is always available if you choose for it to be.  It will amaze -- and it's free.  <answer81177> Evernote Web Clipper, a Safari extension, clips Full Screen or Selection. To a web notebook, yes, but that syncs to Evernote on your computer just about instantly, manually, or set a timed sync.  <answer83578> Paparazzi! is great for full page screenshots. It is not a Safari Extension, yet it has a very nice feature that enables you to launch it from Safari.  Type codepaparazzi:/code in the address bar before the URL, it will launch the application with specified URL. Here is the list of URL format that Paparazzi! uses: http://derailer.org/paparazzi/urlformat  <answer119012> No plugins or anything needed - latest Safari (7, not sure from which version this works) can save to PDF. emFile - Export as PDF.../em and you get entire page, images and all. And it's a lovely hi-res PDF.  <answer146842> ol liOpen that website/li liGo to strongFile/strong → strongSave as/strong from the menu bar/li liSave it on your desktop/li /ol  You will then have your webpage screenshot on your desktop  <answer183114> Safari can do this out of the box: the key is that you need to adjust the page size when printing to PDF.  ol liLoad the website/li liFile - Print.../li liUnder the "Paper Size" pop-up, select "Manage Custom Sizes"/li liCreate a new paper size that fits the entire webpage (eg, 8.5in x 30in)./li liUse the PDF pop-up to "Save as PDF..."/li /ol  The downside to this approach is that if the site has different screen and print styles, you can only get a PDF of the print style.  <answer233856> To get a png of an open window—including Safari webpage:  kbdShift/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbd4/kbd  ...which makes a crosshair appear...then... press kbdSpace/kbd ...turning the crosshair into a camera icon. Use this to click on the window/webpage you want to screenshot. It includes the drop shadow with transparency.  <answer248391> In Safari, click Save As... on the File menu; then, click Save to create a PDF of the web page on the Desktop. Open the PDF in Preview. Click Export As... on the File menu. Choose an image format, and then click Save.  For a complete listing of all screenshot-capture command available in the Finder: support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361  By the way, on Mac OS X 10.11.x, you can set a system preference to hide the menu bar, just like the dock.   <answer252993> CHROME try extension called full screen capture. I found it to be quick and captures very long htmls pages as pngs. Hope this helps someone.  <comment92829> possible duplicate of [Saving a Safari page as a PNG image](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30637/saving-a-safari-page-as-a-png-image) <comment92830> I couldn't get Awesome Screenshot to work with all websites, but I've used [webkit2png](http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/) and [Paparazzi](http://derailer.org/paparazzi/). <comment92834> The other question covers the same end result functionality, but the accepted answer is not a Safari Extension, so unless tillinberlin really doesn't need an extension, this is fine as a related question and not a duplicate. <comment92836> I understand "possible duplicate" but since other questions and other apps weren't really featuring *full page* I just had to ask… <comment92841> Skitch 1.x had a "snap Safari" functionality that was wonderful for making an image of the entire Safari canvas without needing to manually scroll the window down from the top to the bottom. That function was removed from Skitch 2.0 and is still absent in the current version on the App Store :( <comment93019> Hi, welcome to Ask Different! When presenting software as a solution, please provide a link to the program in question. It makes for a better answer and will be easier to upvote. ;) <comment93042> Warning: "Awesome Screenshot" [contains adware](http://forums.mozilla.org/addons/viewtopic.php?p=24997&sid=f12571d12ee7752872394b00e337f8ee). <comment93603> Paparazzi! very good, versatile, free.                 http://derailer.org/paparazzi/ <comment93643> +1 for Paparazzi; I use it often. <comment172995> No, you'll have a web archive of the page, or the page source code, neither of which are a screenshot? <comment182566> I don't know if it's Bootstrap or not, but my PDF is black and white with minimal styling. <comment187020> The only thing to consider is that the PDF will have page breaks. If you need one, continuous, unbroken flow, then PDF is not the right choice. <comment196175> Jing doesn't take full page screenshots. <comment199069> I think this actually just Prints to PDF. Not really a true full-page screen-capture-to-pdf. <comment200929> Just exports the current view to PDF, not the whole page. <comment214154> Great! Works for very long page that Chrome extension cannot handle! <comment234003> This link is dead. <comment254132> The best screenshot capturer for Mac. Forget browser extensions. Paparazzi is awesome. <comment254866> It does not export a WYSISYG image of the page. Good only for so many purposes, unacceptable for a lot more. <comment269927> Agreed. This tool really is great. Especially combined with the ability to interact with the web view and add delays and whatnot. Thanks @mkubilayk! <comment285781> No use if the web page scrolls though. <comment286326> Can't have everything! Stitch it together with Photoshop. <comment288397> saves only the visible part of the page, but at least it's completely built-in.  I think you can turn off the drop-shadow with TinkerTool - don't quote me on that. <comment288399> "if you turn on the `Develop` menu for Safari, you should be able to go from `Safari  Develop  Open With  Paparazzi`", from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3srndw/is_there_a_working_safariextension_for/cx0wtay <comment289259> As noted in the other answers though, you can have everything :) <comment297204> Cannot handle pages that requires you to login. <comment300615> Well, I got an ugly version of my page in pdf. CSS totally broken. <comment301173> Awesome screenshot can havoc your life because of adware, unnecessary ads, slow down you browser and much more. 3rd answer below is best answer. No plugin is needed. <comment303781> @sul4bh You can use the "Interact with Web View" feature to login, via using either pointer icon at the bottom left or View menu. <comment305363> Extension is garbage chrome adware, original question was for a safari extension. <comment305364> @tillinberlin Would you be amenable to removing the solved check mark from the answer that is causing malware/security concerns? You don't have to, but if the tool isn't preferred - another option or none might be better for others. <comment305373> @BadPirate At the time the question was asked there was a Safari extension available. <comment305374> @greenforest -- Think you should pull the answer as it's no longer correct and leads users to a website that seems to be adware / malware driven.  Second answer provide (just below this one) is a great solution, answers the question specifically, and provides better screenshots anyway.  Nothing personal, but the correct answer for the question should be the best one. <comment305377> @BadPirate Changed the answer but can't remove the checkmark. Hope tillinberlin will change. <comment307727> If you can't delete the answer due to the checkmark, we can do it for you if you want. <comment313495> I upvoted this answer, even though it recommends a third-party product, which is not what the user asked for. Go to evernote.com or the App Store and download the app. The clipper is installed with it. Not only does it save web pages as one, long contiguous image, you can actually edit the page like it was a Word document or something. The fonts stay the same, the page reflows like it was Dreamweaver or the like. I don't know why they made the effort, but they did, and it works great. <comment313497> See my revised answer <comment313528> Skitch marks up a web page; Evernote copies them. <comment314821> It's helpful if you provide links to the App/Extension that you are referencing. <comment314822> This doesn't answer the question.  OP is looking for a Safari extension not Chrome.  - From Review <comment322865> How do you do this? I can't get the Clipper to take a screenshot of the entire page. It will *save* the page into Evernote, but what results is not an exportable image, and the "screenshot" function only captures the visible screen, or some subset thereof. <comment339878> Not available for Safari. If you have Chrome, the link is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl <comment344131> exports badly formatted view. not recommended! <comment353040> I wonder if there is an app that can auto-stitch together screenshots that overlap slightly. Safari is not the only browser that doesn’t have an extension for full-page screenshot generation. (Also: MS Edge and the browser on Linux distro Elementary) <comment371673> To be clear, websites can *intentionally* have different designs for print, vs. for web browsers — this question is (at least from my perspective) about capturing the latter. <comment371674> How unhelpful, @NileshParmar. No, most ‘normal people’ (not developers, not designers) don't have multiple browsers on their machine; nor *should* they. <comment371675> Of additional note to scrollers, and devs/designers who *do* have Chrome additionally installed, though — Chrome [now has this built-in](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/devtools-release-notes#screenshots) (Chrome 59+), so no extension is required.
