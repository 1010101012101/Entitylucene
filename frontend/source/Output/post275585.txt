How to minimize all other panels except the one I want to keep open? <body> My requirement is to be able to drag a folder from my desktop to my Terminal app. To do this, I must minimize all other panels except the Terminal.  The beginning status:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8gL4b.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DyzIp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So, if I minimize the panels one by one, it can be very time consuming. Is there a quicker way to achieve this?  <answer275607> With the active application, at the bottom of the application menu itself, you should have a number of options you can use, namely: Hide emApplication Name/em; Hide Others; and, Show All.  On an English keyboard you can use the following shortcuts:  ul likbdcommand/kbdkbdH/kbd to Hide emApplication Name/em/li likbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdH/kbd to Hide Others/li /ul  I'm not sure if it will be the same for you.  Regardless, using the example in your question, the simplest workflow to achieve what you want would be:  ul liOpen Terminal (to make Terminal the active app)/li liIn the menu bar go to Terminal  Hide Others (to hide everything else, including the Finder's open windows)/li liDrag folder over to Terminal/li /ul  By doing the first two steps you're basically making the Desktop visible, which is where your folder is, while also keeping the Terminal app open.  Of course, you should also be able to do the first two via keyboard shortcuts of some kind.  strongNOTE:/strong - Once you're done, you can make all the Finder windows visible again simply by returning to the Finder. This works because you didn't actually minimise the windows to begin with.  <answer275631> Monomeeth's answer is absolutely correct, but in the interest of providing alternatives, I have a functionally similar requirement fairly regularly and my approach is:  ol liPress F11/whatever shortcut you have defined for 'Show desktop'/li liGrab the required file from the desktop with the mouse (click and hold)/li liPress F11/shortcut for 'show desktop' again./li liDrop grabbed file into the destination window./li /ol  For me, this has the advantage of leaving any other windows/apps visible after I've finished grabbing the file I need.   <comment346713> Somewhere under "Window" there should be a button that says "Hide Others" (it might also be under "File") - I'm not positive, I'm not at my computer right now. <comment346714> @NoahL, I did not find that. <comment346728> It's under the application menu.
