How to search for a file by a hash value with bash script (terminal)? <body> I am writing a script for Mac OS X Lion 10.7 and I would like to know how I can search for files based on their SHA1 hashes. I would like to search the whole file system for the file(s) I will be looking for.  For example the SHA1 value code0d882ff2d5edd7d045c1b57320d2e046793868f8/code corresponds to the file codeMacOSXUpdCombo10.7.2.dmg/code How can I search the hard drive for the file with its SHA1 value without needing to compare the file?  <answer46505> You can use the strongcodefind/code/strong command:  precodefind / -type f -exec md5 {} \; | grep 0d882ff2d5edd7d045c1b57320d2e046793868f8 /code/pre  However, since you're running this on all files, it may be extremely slow â€” try stronglimiting the search directory/strong by replacing code//code with the path to a specific directory you want to search.  <answer49020> You may also want to try using xargs depending on how many files you will be searching through.  precodefind / -type f |     xargs -I {} openssl sha1 {} |      grep 0d882ff2d5edd7d045c1b57320d2e046793868f8 /code/pre  <answer130229> Here are a few lines of command which may help find a file from its SHA1 digest. Let's say the file we are hunting is codeMacOSXUpdCombo10.7.2.dmg/code.  precode# store the size of the searched file size=`/bin/ls -l MacOSXUpdCombo10.7.2.dmg | awk '{print $5}'` # store the digest of the serached file sha1=`/usr/bin/openssl sha1 MacOSXUpdCombo10.7.2.dmg | awk '{print $2}'` /usr/bin/sudo find / -type f -size ${size} -exec /usr/bin/openssl sha1 {} \; |     grep ${sha1} /code/pre  This codefind/code will run on plain files and not directories, socket or special files. It will also only run on file of the right strongsize/strong thus avoiding to make a digest of the Kernel or your iTunes library and on a flock of tiny temporary files.  If you are sure that the file name is including the right extension, this find might be accelareted further with the following argument list:  precode/usr/bin/sudo find / -type f -name "*.dmg" -size ${size} -exec /usr/bin/openssl sha1 {} \; |     grep ${sha1} /code/pre  <comment53160> thanks! i was trying to search with shasum -facepalm- <comment53163> You'll need to prefix that with `sudo` if you want the find to reach in to areas of the file system normally off limits to regular users. <comment53353> @BryanLarson if this answer solved your question you should click the check mark under the vote count on the left there to accept yet. <comment56643> `openssl` will still be called once per file thanks to the `-I` option of `xargs`, so there won't be any gain. <comment56644> My apologies, you are correct I have edited my original statement. <comment265196> The `md5` will fail to match a `sha1` hash.
