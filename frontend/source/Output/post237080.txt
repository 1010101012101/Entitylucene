How to make an AppleScript app locate itself? <body> I've been messing around with this cool AppleScript scripting language and I have yet another question. How to make an AppleScript app locate itself?brbrLike something like this (that obviously doesn't work):brcodeget info of myself set variable to "location"/codebrbr So the output, "variable," would be for instance code/home/Desktop/MyEpicApp.app/code.brbrIs there any script or a sequence of them to get the location of the app and store it in a variable?brbrMany thanks in advance, even a tiny bit of help is appreciated.  <answer237083> To set the empath/em of an AppleScript emscript/em or emapp/em to a emvariable/em use the following emcode/em:  precodeset thePath to POSIX path of (path to me as text) /code/pre  Example:  precodeset thePath to POSIX path of (path to me as text) display dialog "The path to me is: " &amp; thePath /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZf3R.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want the empath/em up to the emscript/em or emapp/em set to a emvariable/em use the following emcode/em:  precodeset thePath to POSIX path of ((path to me as text) &amp; ":") /code/pre  Example:  precodeset thePath to POSIX path of ((path to me as text) &amp; ":") display dialog "The path to me is: " &amp; thePath /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7cxs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment290253> without testing - & based an only a vague Applescript ken... 'path to myself' or 'POSIX path to myself'. Applescript definitely understands 'me' to mean this script or this compiled app. Never tested how far that stretches. <comment290255> Try: `set thePath to POSIX path of (path to me as text)` <comment290256> @user3439894 Works perfectly, it's exactly what I want. You can post it as an answer and I'll accept it. Thanks! <comment290262> one more question: how to remove the slash at the end? what's the "opposite" to "something" & someVariable?
