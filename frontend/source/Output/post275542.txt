Upgraded 2009 iMac to Yosemite â€” disk drive no longer working <body> I have a late-2009 iMac and the disk drive has always been fine... until I recently upgraded to Yosemite.  Now whenever I insert disks into it (when they've had files burned onto them) they show up as blank.  Is there anything I can do to fix it?  <comment346660> This question, as it stands, is at risk of being closed. Can you add some detail to clarify what's going on? For starters, by _disk drive_ what do you mean? If you mean the optical drive (i.e. the CD/DVD drive), then that's not the same thing as a disk drive. Also, if you do mean the optical drive, does it work at all? Can you play music CDs? Can you watch a DVD? What about a software DVD (or your original discs that came with the iMac)? As for the disks that show up as blank, how do you know they've had files burned onto them? How did you burn the files?
