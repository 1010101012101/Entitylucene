How to monitor output sound from terminal <body> Is it possible to read current volume or frequency of outgoing sound from terminal? I am using OS X Mavericks  <answer121062> You can get the volumes of the currently selected input, output and sound effects/alert device as a percentage value with an AppleScript one liner:  precodeosascript -e "(get volume settings)" /code/pre  which gives something similar to:  precodeoutput volume:56, input volume:63, alert volume:28, output muted:false /code/pre  <comment141074> Volume maybe since it is one single value (a number). Displaying a frequency as a single number is a problem.
