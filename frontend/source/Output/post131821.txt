Is it possible to let Picasa use a removable device as the Application Support folder using symbolic links? <body> Picasa stores very large files in Application Support folder which consumes limited disk space in system disk. I wonder if I can use symbolic links in order to make Picasa use removable disk as storage space.  <answer131822> Whilst I have no experience with Picasa, I have symlinked many other apps' Application Support folders to other destinations including network drives too without any problems. I ensure the drive is connected with a script before allowing the app to open, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Generally speaking, it'll work fine.  precode┌── ln(1) link, ln -- make links │   ┌── Create a symbolic link. │   │                                      ┌── the path to the new folder │   │                                    ┌─┴────────────────┐ ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/App /Volumes/MyDrive/App       └────────────┬───────────────────┘                    └── the path to the original file/folder                        can use . or ~ or other relative paths /code/pre  supEdited from my canonical linking answer at How can I create a symbolic link in Terminal?/sup  <comment154898> I would think your App will crash once the removable disk is not connected.
