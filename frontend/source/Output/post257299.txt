Get back caps lock default behavior <body> My caps lock key used to work as expected: Press it once, indicator on the key turns on, and I'm in caps lock mode. However some time ago for some reason I realized it turned into a key for switching between IMEs. I believe that happened after I updated to macOS Sierra. The default key for switching IMEs still works as control+space, but then now the caps lock key also becomes another button for that.   Looking in the system preferences in the keyboard  shortcuts section, the shortcut is still set to control+space.
