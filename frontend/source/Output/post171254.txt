How to enable “middle” click of Apple's Magic Mouse? <body> Recently I bought a Magic Mouse from Apple &amp; I want to enable the middle click to use it  in some apps like Chrome, Safari etc.   The native configuration include only left and right click, but is there any way to enable the middle click?  Thanks in advance.  <answer171260> MagicPrefs seems like the only solution currently available to enable a third button on a Magic Mouse.  From their website:     MagicPrefs is a free application for OS X which aims to improve the   functionality and configuration options of the Apple Magic Mouse,   Magic Trackpad and the MacBook glass trackpad.      It features the ability to bind a variable number of finger clicks,   taps, swipes, pinch and other gestures to functions like Middle Click,   Hold Down Both Mouse Buttons, Spaces, Expose, Dashboard, Recent   Applications, Tweet, Read Tweets, Google Reader etc.   <answer171266> BetterTouchTool allows you to program a response to various gestures on the Magic Mouse, Trackpads, and other input devices.  Middle-click, and Middle-tap on the Magic Mouse are both available.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7cP7.png" alt="BetterTouchTool Magic Mouse Gesture menu"  <comment201474> not natively, you will have to outsource it to a 3rd party app. there are free ones out there worth your time <comment271411> MagicPrefs seems not to work with the new Apple Magic Mouse 2 (MLA02LL/A), when you try to customize the behavior of it, it shows a message indicating that the magic mouse was not detected. <comment358270> Works for my Trackpad! Thank you!
