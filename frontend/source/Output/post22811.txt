Changed Lion Server's host name and now unable to browse to that site <body> (Without thinking much) I set up my Mac mini server and used an actual domain name I use as the computer's host name.   I've since changed the host name to something that isn't an actual website, but I'm unable to navigate to the original hostname/domain. I've tried ichangeip/i in the terminal as well, as well as flushed DNS in case it was cached there as well.  How do I get Lion to reach out to the WWW to find this domain?  <answer22824> In terminal enter:  precodehostname -fs /code/pre  That will tell you the hostname of your machine. You may need to edit your hosts file:  precodesudo nano /etc/hosts /code/pre  If your machine is listed in the there simply remove it and then control-w to save the change.  <answer22927> I was able to fix this by removing this from em/etc/named.conf/em  I'm now able to navigate to example.com.  precodezone "example.com" IN {     type master;     file "db.example.com";     allow-transfer {         none;     };     allow-update {         none;     }; }; /code/pre  <comment25447> The hosts file only contains the expected references to localhost — 127.0.0.1 etc — while hostname shows the current hostname. Still no luck...
