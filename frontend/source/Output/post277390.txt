Reinstall OS X Mountain on locked encrypted HD <body> Macbook Pro noob here, sorry if terminology isn't correct.  Just given a broken A1398 and A1502 by work (on the promise I'd reformat hdds) and got them basically working. (cracked screen on one, dead battery on the other).  The hard drives are locked and encrypted. I just want to blow away the partition and reinstall the OS.  However, when I boot up into recovery, I can't just reinstall the OS because it first wants me to unlock the HD.  If I use the disk utility to attempt to erase the partition, after clicking on the partition, clicking on Erase tab, everything below is disabled.  There's no start/erase/apply/commit available to delete/erase/reformat.  Edit:  I ran Verify on the HD partition, and the recovery partition, both say "OK".4  Is this a common problem? I've googled and read a number of pages, each of which ended up in the same place -- unable to delete or reformat or reinstall OS X.  Do I need to remove the HDD and reformat from GParted?  If so, what do I need to know about the partition type, sector sizes, and other parameters?  What are the options?  <comment349156> Yes I know this is probably a duplicate question, but the answers I've found have not resulted in getting the partition recreated, OS reinstalled, etc. <comment349161> Please add links to the other question(s) on the topic <comment349203> Solved using GParted Live on USB bootable, which let me delete the encrypted partition. <comment349247> Can you post this as an answer please, and accept it after the waiting period?
