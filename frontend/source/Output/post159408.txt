Why "Settings" needs Cellular in iOS? <body> I'm getting a similar warning as this one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7N3jt.png" alt="Settings needs Cellular"  Whenever I get to Settings in iOS. I have deactivated Cellular connections for emeverything/em (including Settings) but Chrome Browser.   I'm wondering if anyone know why Settings needs a Cellular connection?  As seen on this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6567893  <answer159434> Not to start a Greek chorus here but I checked on my iPhone 5 with the latest IOS (8.1.1) wth wifie and cellular data off and I do not get that message either.  I am thinking that possibly ajkblue is correct and it may be trying to contact Apple's software update servers or your carriers servers for a carrier update. there is likely a timer that forces a check every week or so.  <comment187333> Mine doesn't seem to do that, even if I switch off wifi so it has to use cellular for everything, switching off Cellular for Settings doesn't give me that prompt. Tried rebooting, restoring? <comment187352> Maybe it needs cellular to check for Software Updates <comment188232> It happens only for cellular data, of course. The prompt shows *every time* I go to Settings.
