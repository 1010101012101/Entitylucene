How do I block a website on a Mac and display a message in its place? <body> So I would like to block a specific website on OS X and iOS devices and display a message in its place something like:  How can I do this so that the block works across all web browsers?  <answer219651> For OSX devices only: Use the hosts file (/etc/hosts) to redirect those hostnames to a local webserver.  Configure your local webserver to only serve up that message. Info here: http://osxdaily.com/2012/09/02/start-apache-web-server-mac-os-x/  For all hosts on a network:  Use an internal DNS server setup to be authorative for your domains and point them to a internal webserver showing your message.  You'll need your DHCP server to distribute your internal DNS server IP so it's used on all your client machines.  <comment265608> This isn't really something you can do "on a mac", or even "on a PC" for that matter...    not without third party software.    You'll need to research parental control software that can be installed, or other types of control software, that would give you both blocking as well as custom messages.    You can easily edit the hosts file on a Mac to block a website...  but there won't be any custom message in its place.   It will just be blocked. <comment265693> Found a way to do this now, using Open DNS, probably the easiest method that also works on iOS <comment265749> How do you edit /etc/hosts on iOS (the original post specifically asks about iOS)?
