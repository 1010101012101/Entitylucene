Can I Use my Certificate Authority and Certificate created in KeyChain Assistant in httpd-ssl.conf? <body> I created a certificate authority and a self signed certificate in ** System** using KeyChain Assistant. I recently updated websites to use SSL. I want to add them to httpd-ssl but I'm not sure how. These sections in that file are below.  precode#   Server Certificate: #   Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If #   the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a #   pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again.  Keep #   in mind that if you have both an RSA and a DSA certificate you #   can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA #   ciphers, etc.) #   Some ECC cipher suites (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4492.txt) #   require an ECC certificate which can also be configured in #   parallel. SSLCertificateFile "/private/etc/apache2/server.crt" #SSLCertificateFile "/private/etc/apache2/server-dsa.crt" #SSLCertificateFile "/private/etc/apache2/server-ecc.crt"  #   Server Private Key: #   If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this #   directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if #   you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure #   both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.) #   ECC keys, when in use, can also be configured in parallel SSLCertificateKeyFile "/private/etc/apache2/server.key" #SSLCertificateKeyFile "/private/etc/apache2/server-dsa.key" #SSLCertificateKeyFile "/private/etc/apache2/server-ecc.key"  #   Server Certificate Chain: #   Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the #   concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the #   certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively #   the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile #   when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server #   certificate for convenience. #SSLCertificateChainFile "/private/etc/apache2/server-ca.crt"  #   Certificate Authority (CA): #   Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA #   certificates for client authentication or alternatively one #   huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded) #   Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks #         to point to the certificate files. Use the provided #         Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes. #SSLCACertificatePath "/private/etc/apache2/ssl.crt" #SSLCACertificateFile "/private/etc/apache2/ssl.crt/ca-bundle.crt" /code/pre  When I attempt to export both the CA and self-signed certificate it only allows me to create files with extension p12 or cer. The Server Private Key section says that file should have an extension key. I cannot export the private key portion of the self-signed certificate separately.  I have done multiple searches about ssl on the Mac and they all say to use openssl. However I thought that Apple quit supporting that. The documentation I have found has been from 2014 and earlier. OpenSSL 0.9.8zh 14 Jan 2016 is on my system.  How do I proceed with setting up ssl using my certificates in KeyChain Assistant if that is possible? Otherwise what are 2017 instructions on how to create and implement ssl using OpenSSL?
