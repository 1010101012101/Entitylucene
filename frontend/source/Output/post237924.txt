Updating individual Darwin libraries? <body> I was wondering how one would go about doing this rather than waiting for them to be updated in a maybe too-distant System update? I receive notifications of security updates to Unix libraries like DSA-3574-1 libarchive -- security update and, while this is primarily an update for Debian, the alert says it's for "Unix variants" - including OS X. I see this library exists under code/usr/lib/code, so, is it possible to update it independently of OS X updates?  Presumably, you'd have to obtain the updated source from, where - FreeBSD &amp; then compile it? Does anyone ever do this?  I've heard Apple can be a bit tardy in its application of Unix security updates so there could be a reason to do this for a particularly severe case applicable to one's environment.  <comment291636> 1.: Try asking @SuperUser, AskDifferent is usually for the "standard Enduser" -- 2. besides looking for beta updates of osx you could indeed try to compile for BSD, afaik apple is a FreeBSD/BSD Variant.. 3. Yes Apple is a bit tardy here.. it will probably won't like the manual updates <comment291670> @YoshiBotX AskDifferent is for all Apple users and so on topic here as well as in SU. 2) Yes it is a giant but if does differ from BSD so you will need a OSX variant anyway
