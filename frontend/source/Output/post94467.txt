Group messaging using an iPhone <body> Is there a way to send group messages on the iPhone without an app? And without individually choosing the contact in the group?  <answer94486> The iPhone's built-in Messages app emcan/em send group messages: open the app, go to the messages list, hit the Compose Message button in the upper-right corner, and use the Add code(+)/code icon in the To: field to add multiple recipients.  You cannot, however, add an entire group as a message recipient; multiple recipients must be added one at a time.  <comment110753> What iPhone and iOS are you using?
