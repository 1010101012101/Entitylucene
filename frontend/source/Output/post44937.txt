Downloaded app on iPad, now I cannot download it on iPhone <body> I downloaded cinemagram on my iPad2 running latest iOS5.1 - now I want to install it on my iPhone 4S running latest iOS5.1, the install is greyed out  I even deleted it on my iPad - that did not help.  strongUPDATE/strong iCloud had instantaneously downloaded it onto my iPhone but on the other screen I never look at.  <answer44939> I'm assuming you iPhone is compatible (iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S)?  If not, that's your problem.  That's the only reason I could think for it being greyed out.  strongupdate:/strong Make sure iCloud didn't already install it on your phone.  <answer44944> You might be having this error because the app is already installed. If you have automatic downloads turned "on" for the App Store on your iPhone, iCloud will push the app to your phone if you buy it on another device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W07G2.png" width="300"  <answer142089> ol liGo to the App Store from your iPhone and iPad./li liTap on the Update tab./li liOpen Purchased and filter by Not on This iPhone/iPad./li liA list of apps able to be re-downloaded will be shown.

You can set iCloud to automatically download apps to multiple devices when they're purchased. <comment51125> DUH - on the other screen. You are correct. Add as answer and I will accept it <comment51127> Sorry for not being clear. Yes all is iOS5.1 and I found the reason. I have all apps on one screen, iCloud downloaded it immediately onto another screen on my iPhone <comment51129> yeah, i thought you checked to see if it was already installed... <comment51131> Yeah - I will next time. Just a thinko. <comment51134> @mplungjan OK, added <comment167562> This is super old - I'm on iOS 7 now on a 5S
