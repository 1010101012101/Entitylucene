How to make a test user without a credit card? <body> I'd like to create a test user in iTunes Connect, so I can test in-app purchases. However, iTunes forces me to enter credit card information. Considering this is a test user, for a sandbox environment, that is not supposed to be spending any money, it looks pointless. Is there any way around it? (I know that it is possible to create a emnew/em account with no payment option, but then it won't be considered as a test user.)  <answer88285> OK, as it turns out the test user can only be used from within the sandbox environment, which makes certain sense. This is described here.  <answer235743> I just went through this today. The answer, in short is:  ol liLog OUT in Settings on your iPad, but do strongnot/strong log back in to the App Store there/li liLog in from within your app at the moment of making the IAP/li /ol  Do not enter your credit card info for this sandbox user.   <comment103830> Thanks for waiting for us to roll out iTunes connect as in-scope for the site. <comment356434> This link is no longer helpful, but the test user CANNOT be used on a copy of your app that you downloaded from the App Store (it will ask you to verify the user and enter a credit card). You can use the test user when you are running the app from a build you created in Xcode.
