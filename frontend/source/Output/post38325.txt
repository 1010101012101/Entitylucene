Can I change input source per physical keyboard? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Internal keyboard QWERTY; External Keyboard Dvorak       I want to alter my strongkeyboard layout/strong per keyboard, so my MacBook's keyboard is Dvorak and a bluetooth keyboard is QWERTY. How can this be accomplished? I can find a setting for changing modifier keys per physical keyboard, but not layouts.  <answer38334> Not possible as far as I know.  You have to switch the layout using a keyboard shortcut (normally Apple/command + space) or the Input Menu on the screen.
