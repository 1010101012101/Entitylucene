Find images of a specific size and move them to trash from terminal <body> Im sorting images in a kinda large image library, and thumbnails from old iPhoto-library is still in there. And I'm in need of removing them to improve speed of sorting the images.  I have found this answer here for linux, but how about macOS? Is there a way of searching a folder, recursively, and determine if the image code*.jpg, *.png, *.bmp, *.jpeg/code have the W360 and H270?  Running Sierra 10.12.4  <answer281143> Here is an example codebash/code emscript/em that can achieve the goal natively, no need to install anything.  precode#!/bin/bash  targetDir="$HOME/Pictures"  find "$targetDir" -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.bmp' -o -iname '*.jpeg' 2&gt;/dev/null | \ while read -r filename; do     hw="$(sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth "$filename" 2&gt;/dev/null)"     h="$(awk '/pixelHeight/{print $2}'&lt;&lt;&lt;"$hw")"     w="$(awk '/pixelWidth/{print $2}'&lt;&lt;&lt;"$hw")"     if [[ $h -eq 270 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ $w -eq 360 ]]; then         echo rm "$filename"     fi done /code/pre  All you need to do is set the codetargetDir/code emvariable/em to the starting point of where you want the codefind/code emcommand/em to look. The default is the Pictures folder within your Home folder.  strongNote:/strong In the example emscript/em the codeecho/code emcommand/em needs to be removed from in front ofbr coderm "$filename"/code in order for the emfiles/em to actually be deleted and is there so you can first test the output of the emscript/em as to what emfiles/em will be deleted. You can of course choose to remove it without testing and just go for it, if you're confident that you want to delete any .jpg, .png, .bmp or .jpeg file with dimensions of 270 pixel height by 360 pixel width within the codetargetDir/code.  Also note that depending on the total file count of the target file extensions, the running of this emscript/em can take some amount of time to complete. On my system it found ~1000 files to delete out of 27500 files in my Pictures folder and took at least 5 to 10 minutes to complete.  That said, I ran this script, as it's written, and the only files other then the test file I created with the target dimensions, all other files found where in one specific location within my iPhoto Library bundle in the Thumbnails folder. So, wouldn't it just be easier to go into the bundle and delete the contents in Finder? That is, if it's really just those Thumbnails you want to get rid of!  hr  If you don't know how to use the emscript/em, do the following in Terminal:  precodetouch delete270x360images open delete270x360images /code/pre  Copy and paste the emscript code/em from above into the opened codedelete270x360images/code document, modify as needed/wanted and then save and close.  In Terminal, make it executable:  precodechmod u+x delete270x360images /code/pre  Now to use it in Terminal, type the following and then press enter.  precode./delete270x360images /code/pre  Wait for it to complete.  <comment353712> You could install `imagemagick` or fashion an algorithm using `mdls`. Something like `mdls -raw -name kMDItemPixelWidth file` would get you the width of the image file.
