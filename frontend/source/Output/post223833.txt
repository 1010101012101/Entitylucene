Lost hard drive space to Boot Camp <body> Boot Camp caused ~200 GB of my 750 GB HD to disappear and I cannot re(un)-partition it through Disk Utility and when I try to reformat the storage through the terminal using:  precodediskutil cs resizeVolume /code/pre  with the appropriate name and size this is what it tells me  precodeThe Core Storage Logical Volume UUID is 4D5406D2-B7BC-4719-AC41-DC984D4CCB53 Started CoreStorage operation Error: -69674: The provided Core Storage logical volume has an incorrect size; you should run whole-disk repair /code/pre  What else can I try and/or what should I do?  I couldn't find any answered questions that helped but please link any that you think are helpful.

If that fails you have to delete the Logical Volume Group as well. Create a new one - including a new Logical Volume.   Restore your backup and boot to your main volume again.  Finally enable FileVault and encrypt your main volume.  <comment271347> If you provide much more information (`diskutil list`, `diskutil cs list`, `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and the OS X version)  you will get an answer soon. Please add this to your answer by editing it. <comment271348> Did you do as the error message suggested, "you should run whole-disk repair"? <comment271413> Thanks @klanomath for the suggestion, I added all of it.  user3439894 when I run first aid on the disk (in safe mode and not in safe mode) it says that it will repair it if needed and it recognizes that the size is incorrect but does nothing,  if there is another step in disk utility other than selecting the disk and then running first aid on it please let me know, I don't know to much about this stuff and everything I found online either didn't apply due to different situations or the action(s) described was not available.
