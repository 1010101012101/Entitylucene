After update to El Capitan, can't write to my home dir? <body> I did a hard drive wipe and clean reinstall for OS X 10.11 El Capitan. I now get some permission errors about my home directory.  Here's an example, after running the program codepsql/code, which is the PostgreSQL command line interface.  precodecould not save history to file "/Users/rob/.psql_history": Permission denied /code/pre  If I look at my home dir, the coderwx/code part looks right, but there is an extra ACL. Should I delete that ACL? Why is it there? Lots of programs write to code./code files in home directory.  precode$ ls -lde /Users/rob/ drwxr-xr-x@ 27 rob  staff  918 Oct 22 16:31 /Users/rob/ 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown /code/pre  <comment256415> What are permissions on the file? <comment256419> There is no file. I think the error is when it can't create it.
