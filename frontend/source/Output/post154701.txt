Git autocompletion is not working with homebrew <body> Here is my setup:  precodebrew install git bash-completion Warning: git-2.1.3 already installed Warning: bash-completion-1.3 already installed /code/pre  In .bash_profile:  precodeif [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then     . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion fi /code/pre  But I still don't have autocompletion for git commands. (I used macports before, but completely removed it because I couldn't get git commands to autocomplete no matter what I tried.)  I am on OSX 10.10  <answer154722> Try download directly in your home directory:  precodecurl -O https://raw.github.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash mv git-completion.bash .git-completion.bash /code/pre  Then in your code.bash_profile/code add the following:  precodeif [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then     . ~/.git-completion.bash fi /code/pre  <answer155847> For Yosemite, after I upgraded to git 2.1.3 with homebrew, this worked in my code.profile/code file (code.bash_profile/code or similar would work, too):  precode# git tab completion (homebrew) if [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash ]; then     . `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash fi /code/pre  I used to have codegit-prompt.sh/code there, but changing it to codegit-completion.bash/code worked for me.  ymmv.  <answer230940> On my system (10.10.5), I fixed this by creating a symlink in /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ to the bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash in the GIT directory. In my case:  precodecd /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d ln -s ../../Cellar/git/2.7.2/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash git-completion.bash /code/pre  be sure to checkout your installed version of git and replace 2.7.2 with your version.  <comment182016> Did this `wget  https://raw.github.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash && source git-completion.bash`, no luck yet. <comment187987> @qed, that + answer's .bash_profile worked for me. <comment285555> I already have that, but it still doesn't work. <comment285556> Even `. ~/.git-completion.bash` directly in the shell does not work. No error message either.
