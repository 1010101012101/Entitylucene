Cut & Paste not working reliably on macOS Sierra <body> I recently upgraded my machine to macOS Sierra. In the last couple of days I've noticed that cutting and pasting is increasingly flakey. I thought initially that copy wasn't working since I didn't seem to be able to copy new content to the clipboard, but after trying various things I now have my machine in a state where Cmd-V or pasting via the Edit menu produces a different result to pbpaste. Are there any circumstances under which this would be expected?  I'm not sure how to diagnose this. In another similar question I saw a request for the output of codekextstat | grep -v com.apple/code, which I've added below.  precodeIndex Refs Address            Size       Wired      Name (Version) UUID &lt;Linked Against&gt;   146    3 0xffffff7f846da000 0x60000    0x60000    org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv (5.0.10) 23DD0853-7210-3AF2-85FA-1C7FF8F7D1BF &lt;7 5 4 3 1&gt;   147    0 0xffffff7f8473a000 0x14000    0x14000    com.intel.kext.intelhaxm (6.0.1) 8FF2C637-0A5E-367E-B007-5B08655B1E8A &lt;7 5 4 3 1&gt;   153    0 0xffffff7f8474e000 0x8000     0x8000     org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB (5.0.10) C5D33477-F93D-36AD-8748-1EB1105FB93A &lt;152 146 41 7 5 4 3 1&gt;   154    0 0xffffff7f84756000 0x5000     0x5000     org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt (5.0.10) E5ABC825-5396-34A7-9B63-3A38E9142EEC &lt;146 7 5 4 3 1&gt;   155    0 0xffffff7f8475b000 0x6000     0x6000     org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp (5.0.10) BEFC91DC-800F-3F16-8388-50584243FB30 &lt;146 5 4 1&gt; /code/pre  I'll probably have to restart my machine now since I really need to get work done, but any suggestions for when this happens again would be gratefully received.  <comment342300> Perhaps you could link to the ‘similar question’ you found? <comment342358> Sierra (and iOS 10) introduced the [universal clipboard](http://www.imore.com/how-use-universal-clipboard-macos-sierra), which I'm guessing also introduced a few bugs. Are you signed into iCloud, with iOS devices nearby? Does signing out of iCloud help? <comment342453> @grgarside Good idea, done, thanks. The issue related but not that similar, but several commenters asked for this information to help diagnose it. <comment342454> @calum_b Thanks for the suggestion, I'll definitely try that next time this occurs.
