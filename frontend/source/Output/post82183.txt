How to specify the BIND DN in the LDAP client? <body> I have configured the LDAP client to connect to the company LDAP server, OpenLDAP. The phone makes a connection, STARTTLS is done and processed OK but then the phone sends a BIND with an invalid DN:  do_bind: invalid dn (username)br RESULT tag=97 err=34 text=invalid DN  (at the "username" place, the username entered for the account is sent)br I have configured the server to ignore the BIND DN, but it still fails because the phone sends this syntactically incorrect DN and the server rejects it before realizing that it does not have to check the DN.  How do I get the phone to send a correct BIND DN? I have not found any way to configure the BIND DN for the LDAP account.  <comment98661> I wonder why nobody has an answer to this question...  am I really the only user of LDAP on an iPhone on the planet??
