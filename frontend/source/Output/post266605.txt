My iPhone 6s Plus - System failure call failed <body> My iPhone 6s Plus randomly will display "System failure call failed" while I'm on the phone and will hangup the phone call. I have restored the phone but that has not helped.   iOS 10.2  Any advice is appreciated.   <comment334303> Instead of restoring the iPhone, have you tried setting it up as New?  There might be a problem with something you're restoring. <comment334304> Will give that a try and post back. Thanks! <comment334305> I've had a 50% success rate doing restores of backups to new iPhones.  I'm not saying this is the cause of your problem, but it's a good starting step to doing the troubleshooting.
