Hotkey switching between spelling dictionaries <body> I'm often using 4 languages for writing texts. Now, each time switching languages with:  ul likbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd:/kbd/li liand changing the language in the popup/li /ul  Is possible somewhat /applescript, shell-script, anyhow :)/ define a global hotkey for my 4 languages? Something like  ul likbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd1/kbd - selects English/li likbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd2/kbd - selects Czech/li lietc../li /ul  Ps: and no, the automatic language detection maybe works for few languages, but not for me.. :(  <answer96392> You could assign shortcuts to scripts like this:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)     set shown to title of windows contains "Spelling and Grammar"     if not shown then keystroke ":" using command down     tell (window 1 where title is "Spelling and Grammar")         delay 0.1         tell pop up button 1             click             click UI element "Deutsch" of menu 1         end tell         if not shown then click button 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  It's probably not possible to use the setLanguage: method in NSSpellChecker in DefaultKeyBinding.dict.  <comment113098> The app Nisus Writer lets you set that up in its preferences.  But you presumably want it for all apps. <comment113099> @TomGewecke yes, looking for how to setup a global hotkey, for the _builtin spellchecker_, e.g. what works for TextEdit, Mail, Safari textboxes (like in this comment), and so on. <comment113169> The script ended with error, but got the idea. Thank you :) <comment113182> If it was that access for assistive devices is disabled, you can enable it from the accessibility preference pane.
