Can a non-retina iMac with i7 3.5 Ghz and GTX775M handle three displays? <body> I am thinking about getting a used strongemnon-retina/em/strong iMac with these specs:  precodeCore i7 3,5 GHz 32GB RAM 1TB SSD GTX 775M /code/pre  Since I own two Apple 27" Displays I'd like to hook these up via Thunderbolt/MDP.  My question is: Can the iMac handle all the 3 displays (including the built-in one) or will I have UI lag/stutter? Will the iMac get hot? How would the fan noise be with this setup?  <answer240222> Here are the steps:  ul liGo to the Apple Menu (top-left hand corner)/li liClick codeAbout this Mac/code/li liCheck your graphics card, /li /ul  What does it tell you it can handle?  <answer240224> I am assuming that you are referencing a 27" Late 2013 iMac because there is no 21" iMac that has that specific CPU frequency.  You can have up to two external displays connected via strongThunderbolt/strong  according to the specs posted on EveryMac.com  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bfFJ4.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have used 30" and 43" displays with my iMac and there has been zero lag.  I also only have SSDs (no hard drives) so I have had zero issues with heat, even with multiple displays.
