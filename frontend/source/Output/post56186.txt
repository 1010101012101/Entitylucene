Backup the entire image of Mac book pro <body> I have Mac book pro with OSX-10.7.3, which has to be give back to my company. I bought a new/personal mac book pro and I'd like to copy all the data including  bootcamp images.   Is it possible to take the image/backup of entire disk including bootcamp images??   Do we have to worry about any applications if you take a backup on one mac and restore on other mac ??(for e.g parallel software)   Please suggest the best possible backup/copy method to transfer all the content/data/applications from one mac to other.   Thanks,  Kiran  <answer56194> Carbon Copy Cloner for your OSX partition, and Winclone for your Bootcamp partition. Winclone is now commercial software, but I believe you can still download older versions for free elsewhere.  <answer56207> CopyCatX will do exactly what you want.  You could take a look at Apple's Migration Assistant, too, for the Mac-to-Mac file transference.     You can use strongMigration Assistant/strong in OS X Lion to transfer important information, such as user accounts, applications, network and computer settings, and files, from one Mac computer to another via a FireWire cable, ThunderBolt cable, or via an Ethernet or wireless network   <answer56212> Make a Time Machine backup of the OS X partition on the old machine which can be restored on the new mac.  Just insert a virgin USB drive and OS X will offer it itself.  Then insert the drive in the new mac and follow instructions.  For the Boot Camp empartition/em enter it and use the backup mechanism included in Windows for that.  Note that the Windows 7 rescue disk wipes the emwhole/em drive for Windows, not only the Windows partition so don't do that.
