Encrypted disk does not accept password on Mac <body> I made an encrypted backup disk, and I've entered the exact correct password a few times, but system does not accept it. Any idea what is going on? Strange on other backup disk behaves in the same way. One of them is a WD disk. Is it something wrong with my Mac?  <answer214850> A few possibilities:     ol   licap-locks are inadvertently on now, or when you made the password/li   liyou cut-paste the password from a 'secret' file, but the password has an extra space at the end?/li   liYou are typing an 'oh' instead of a 'zero' when you look at your hand-written notes?/li   liYou have changed your 'default keyboard' from U.S. to British, or something odd like that?/li   /ol   Just my two cents.  <comment259140> I'd say you're probably not typing the right password, even though you think you are. <comment259142> Earlier I started reparation a USB drive, and that stucked, and I think Disk Utility get corrupted. Then I restarted Mac, and afterwards password was accepted.
