App crashes frequently <body> I have an iPad running iOS 9. Pages crashes frequently. Do I have a virus or malware that can be removed easily? Factory reset about 1 week ago.  <comment349653> Which iPad do you have? Is iOS 9 the last version available for that device or have you just not updated? A virus/malware is extremely unlikely.
