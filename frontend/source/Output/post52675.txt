How do I find out what entitlements an app has? <body> Sandboxed apps have to declare their entitlements.  Of course, that doesn't do me any good if I can't tell what entitlements it declares.  A text editor that has entitlements for Core Location, Network Server, and my Address Book, without my knowledge, could be much worse than an unsandboxed app.  How can I see what entitlements an app has?  <answer52680> After some more searching, I found a command-line answer:  precodecodesign -d --entitlements - /Applications/Whatever.app/ /code/pre  This will print out an XML plist with values like:  precode&lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.app-sandbox&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  If anyone knows an easier/nicer way, though, I'd love to hear it.
