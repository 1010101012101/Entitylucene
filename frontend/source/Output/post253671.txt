El Captain is not switching to the space of the clicked application <body> I am using Mission Control to work across multiple spaces. I do this to so that I can switch between the spaces real quick as I am multitasking across them.   The problem is...  that when I click on the icon of an application which is open in an other space the view does not switch to that other space, despite having had configured that in the Mission Control settings: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Thc9K.png" alt="enter image description here"  For example:  ul liSpace1 - Google Chrome /li liSpace2 - Terminal /li /ul  When I am in space 2 and    click on the Chrome icon on the dock the view does not switch to    space1. (Only the top bar changes).  Not sure what to do... strongis there a way to reset Mission Control settings in the OS so I guess with a  bit of luck this feature would recover itself?/strong  <comment315703> Solved.
