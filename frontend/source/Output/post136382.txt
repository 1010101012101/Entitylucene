Automate mobile terminal? <body> I have a jailbroken iPhone. I use it to reboot my router when my wifi is going slow or messing up. But I'm lazy and I was looking for a way to automate the process. I use shortcuts that mobile terminal lets you create so you can just tap the command instead of having to type it. But is there a way I can create a script or run everything with a single command to do this for me?  Commands are as follows:  precodesu  (su password)  ssh 192.168.1.1  (router password)  reboot /code/pre  Can I jam all of that into one single process?  <answer136586> The script you want would be the following:  precode#!/bin/bash su ssh 192.168.1.1 &lt;&lt;-EOF     reboot     exit EOF /code/pre  If you can ssh into your iPhone from a computer, do so. Once you're logged in, create a new text file using codenano ~/script/code (install nano from cydia if it isn't already) and paste the above script. Then hit code^X/code (control-X) and codeY/code to save the script. The script is in your home directory (code~/code) for quick access. Now, set the proper permissions to be able to execute the script:   precodechmod 755 script /code/pre  Now you can open MobileTerminal on the iPhone and type ./script, which will execute it.  If you have to do it locally, the easiest way is probably using iFile: open it and change to the home folder using the button at the bottom of the screen.  ol liTap on "edit" (top right) and "+" (bottom left). /li liEnter a name and change the type to "Regular File", then tap "Create". /li liTap on the file and select "Text Viewer" in the list. /li liTap on "Edit" and copy the above script/li liTap "Save" and "Done" and go to MobileTerminal to execute it (no need to set permissions, iFile did it)/li /ol  Final note: you might want to set up automatic login using keys: http://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/  That way, you only have to launch the script, no password-typing required.  <comment162060> It will take some configuring, but it's possible. In fact, you can jam all of that into a single command, not just a script. The command would look like `ssh root@192.168.1.1 'reboot'`. You just need to set up SSH keys. <comment163000> Thanks for the script. I got that part done with no problems. But when I do the public/private key authentication, I follow the steps but then in the end when I try to ssh into my router, it says "permission denied (public key)". I have the public and private key saved in ~/.ssh/ on my phone. And then on ddwrt there's a text box that lets you copy and paste authorized keys.  I paste the public key that my phone generated into the dd wrt box, and I uncheck "password login" I apply and reboot my router. Then I try to run ssh and get permission denied (publickey) <comment164558> Both computers need each other's public key to be able to identify. There should be some option on the router's web-interface to create a key, which should then be copied into the text file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on your iPhone.
