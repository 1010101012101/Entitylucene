Snow Leopard hidden app behavior in Lion <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can I get back Snow-Leopard-like application hiding (Cmd-H) in Lion?       I have 10.7 running on my personal laptop and 10.6 on my work machine, and recently noticed they act differently on hidden apps.  In 10.6, when I hide an app then hold down kbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdTab/kbd, it shows a list of all the open apps and the hidden app will be at the end of the app-switcher. This way, if I just press (instead of holding down) kbd⌘/kbd-kbdTab/kbd after hiding the app, it will not switch back and show that hidden app immediately.  However, in 10.7, Apple changed things up entirely: that hidden app will stay in its position after I hide it, so if I hit kbd⌘/kbd-kbdTab/kbd, I'll immediately unhide the app I just hid, which seems to defeat the point of hiding the app.  So I am wondering if there is a way I can get that 10.6 hidden app behavior back on 10.7?
