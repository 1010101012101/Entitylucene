22.7GB for storing "org.mozilla.pluginContainer" even after deleting Mozilla Firefox <body> I deleted Mozilla Firefox and I checked my file storage and saw that within my caches folder I have a folder called strongorg.mozilla.pluginContainer/strong which contains a strongfsDataCache/strong folder which is taking 22.7GB of space.   Can I simply empty that folder as I am not sure whether that folder will have any effect on other apps within my laptop. Is it safe to remove that folder completely?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eA4KQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer259923> You can safely delete the contents of the fsCachedData folder.  If you're still worried, don't delete the data immediately but copy it to a different folder. You can then delete it after a few days if you haven't experienced any problems.  <comment325275> Perfect.
