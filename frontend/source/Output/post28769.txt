Is there an app that allows me to monitor time spent using an application? <body> Is there a tool that allows you to monitor the amount of time spent actively interacting with an application? This would be useful for development work to get an idea of just how long projects take.  EDIT:  I've been using RescueTime as it tracks apps, catagorises them based on productivity levels, and also looks at web pages visited.  <answer28772> The application Time Sink ($5, Many Tricks) tracks the amount of time you spend in each application (and each window within an application).  <answer28794> TimeEdition is an application that I just found. I haven't used it yet, but it's free. However, it doesn't have as many features as Time Sink.  <answer28799> Timing helps in tracking time spent in applications (and their windows) as well. It's similar to Time Sink but seems to provide more grouping and reporting options.  <answer94596> emTime Sink/em seems to do this job — a job that I find useless —, and costs only 5 little dollars.  emTictoc/em keeps track of time spent in tasks, rather than in applications. Which starts to be a little more useful.  <answer220980> Apps Usage is an app for Mac users, who want to know, how much time they spent on each used application.  <comment33074> You have two good questions here. Generally, it works best if each question gets a separate post, rather than combining more-or-less unrelated questions. <comment33120> Yes, @Daniel is right. I've removed the first question since people have already answered the second one. Please feel free to ask your first question again separately. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks.
