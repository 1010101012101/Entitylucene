iPod plugged in <body> I've been sleeping with my iPod.  But it's plugged in to the wall and I always put it in bed with me while charging . Is it dangerous to have a plugged iPod in bed with you while sleeping .  <answer90752> As with all things in life there are some risks you may want to be aware of here:  ul liYou might get entangled into the cord and either endager yourself or damage the phone/cord/plug by ripping it out of the wall when you turn yourself/li liYou may end up laying on top of your phone leading to overheating and your bed catching fire/li liElectro-magnetic radiation from the cord may or may not impact your sleep pattern/li liOne of the tracks you are listening to may be much louder than the others leading to a unpleasant wake up call in the middle of the night/li /ul  OTOH I've never heard of anybody dying in their sleep due to a plugged in iPod so the probability of the more severe incidents is extremely low. And you could work around most of the risks above by getting a bluetooth headset and putting the iPod on a table besides your bed.
