How to play videos in HD on youtube.com in Safari on iPhone 6 <body> I just got my first iPhone. There’s an issue with connecting to the App Store, so I’m watching videos on youtube.com in Safari. I’ve noticed that the videos are low-res. I don’t see the setting to turn on HD video sources. (I’m connected to my WLAN.)  Is it not possible to view HD videos on YouTube in Safari?  <answer157882> Mobile Safari (on iOS) will not play videos in HD on Youtube. You would have to view the videos from within the Youtube app to get higher resolution video.  <answer171981> Workaround: Use the emdesktop/em site, here is how:  ol liIn mobile Safari, find the clip that you want to watch, it will initially start in low resolution./li liTap the address bar./li liSwipe down in the page and you should see strongRequest Desktop Site/strong, tap it. Sometimes this may open the clip in the YouTube app on the first attempt, try again!/li liOn the second attempt it may ask you to open in YouTube app, don't allow!/li liOn the third attempt you should see the Desktop version of YouTube./li liTap inside the video to start playing in HD, sometimes you need to tap a second time./li /ol  Note: on my iPhone 4s iOS 8.1.2 the Desktop version of YouTube is much slower, unresponsive and harder to use. But since YouTube app can't play any videos over AirPlay, I had to find alternatives.  <comment185715> How can this be? A modern mobile browser like Safari should be able to handle HD video streams. Do you have more on this? <comment185780> I didn't say Safari can't handle HD video streams. For whatever reason, you cannot stream **Youtube** HD videos in Safari. My guess is they want you to use the app instead.
