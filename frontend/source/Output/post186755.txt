I want to test an iphone app on my windows laptop <body> I want to do manual testing of an iPhone app on my Windows laptop. Is there any tool or simulator. How can I install the build on that simulator?  <answer186759> Apple only allows building and testing apps on a Mac. There no simulator available for Windows.   Installing a virtual machine on your PC with OSX running on it is against Apple's EULA.   <comment220555> afaik, you need Xcode, which only runs on Mac <comment220563> see also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4992/can-i-develop-iphone-apps-in-windows <comment220591> This is far too broad to answer or even know if it's on topic here. What does the app do? What specifically will be "tested"? Is it a functional test or a performance test or a networking test? As you can see, from the comments and answers, people are thinking you mean develop on Windows when you ask about "testing" which isn't really defined by you.
