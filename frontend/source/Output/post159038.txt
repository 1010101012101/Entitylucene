Set sublime text to read .asp files as .php files (with php syntax) <body> I have a few code.asp/code files that I want to edit with Sublime Text, however, I always have to change the syntax to codePHP/code under View - Syntax - PHP. Is there anyway that I can make Sublime Text automatically read it as PHP?  <answer159041> Go to View → Syntax → Open all with current extension as... and select PHP.
