Apple doesn't sign 7.0.6 anymore. They sign 7.1.1 now. <comment154768> so what should i do? there is no untethered jailbreak for 7.1.1 & this is why i want to use 7.0.6. <comment154769> Since you don't have blobs saved for 7.0.6, you might be out of luck. Unless someone else has a solution. <comment154771> but there should be more luck. if not so sucks... <comment159259> See my definitive answer here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/114076/18387
