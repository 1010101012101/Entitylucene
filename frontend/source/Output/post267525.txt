Unlocking a locked Apple Watch <body> I won an Apple Watch last June.  I do not own an iPhone, so I gave it to my son.  He passed away December 1.  He rarely wore the watch, and when I was checking it out, saw it was locked to his iCloud account. Is there a way to re-set this watch?  I do not have the credentials for his iCloud account.  A friend is trying to set it up, but says he needs the iCloud credentials. Thank you in advance for any assistance.  <comment335775> sorry about your son, be sure to see the linked answer at the top of your question for a solution. and welcome to Ask Different.
