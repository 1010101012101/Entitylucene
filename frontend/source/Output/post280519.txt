Console Log flooded with "SMB client not supported - Unicode strings are required" <body> My console log is getting flooded with this message, many times a second. In fact, what I'm trying to do is share some directories on my Mac with the Debian Linux box sitting right next to it.  The Mac is running a fresh install of El Cap (10.11.6) with Server 5.2. The shared folders are configured to use both SMB and APFS only.  On the linux side I have what I believe to be the correct options for mounting CIFS shares. This is from my code/etc/fstab/code:  precode//lulu/video /media/video cifs user,credentials=/home/alastair/.smbcredentials,uid=alastair,gid=alastair 0 0 /code/pre  In addition I have tried the codeiocharset=utf8/code option but it doesn't make any difference - the server log message appears regardless.  Note that there is NO problem connecting - it all works just fine, except that the Mac slows to a crawl, presumably because it is so busy logging to the console.  There are no network issues that I'm aware of either - the two machines share a keyboard and mouse via Synergy, which works fine over the ethernet connection. Ditto SSH.
