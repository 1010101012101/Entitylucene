How do I fix "could not activate cellular data network" problem when returning to US after traveling and using a different SIM card? <body> After traveling overseas (Vietnam &amp; Japan) and using a SIM card for each country, I restored my AT&amp;T SIM card into my iPhone and got:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FMtSm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried the suggestions in https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201415 and all of the suggestions in https://appletoolbox.com/2013/04/iphone-could-not-activate-cellular-data-network-fix/ except backing up and restoring, but nothing worked.  <answer295335> I called AT&amp;T and was asked to see if there is a profile at the bottom of Settings-General. There was, and deleting it fixed the problem. Apparently profiles are often installed when using overseas SIM cards.
