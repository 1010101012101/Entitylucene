What is a user friendly ebook converter for pc to Nook HD+? <body> I've tried using calibre, but it cuts out or messes with the original text from the pdf. I don't want to just give up and read from my computer, so any ideas? (please posts links if any.)  <answer119643> Calibre is without a doubt the best ebook library converter/manager I've ever used.  Free and crossplatform for Mac, Linux, and Windows.  <comment139549> Why do you need to convert from pdf?  I think there are apps like ezpdf to read them on the nook. <comment139550> Are you looking for an OSX or a Windows solution? <comment139566> The issue is that pdf is designed for the page size the author wants and there is not enough information in the pdf to convert it automatically into a flowing format like epub sothere is probably nothing that much better than calibre unless you program for each pdf
