Can I charge my 2016 MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt to USB-C <body> I forgot my power supply today, but I have an older powered thunderbolt (2?) display and drives. Can I plug the thunderbolt out from my display into my thunderbolt to USB-C adapter somehow to charge my laptop? The connections I set up now don't seem to be doing anything.  Please hurry ;^) 19% and dropping....  18%...!  <answer268105> Thunderbolt 1 and 2 do not support power delivery.  You won't be able to charge your device from the Thunderbolt cable on your display or drives.  Thunderbolt 3 implemented the USB-C power delivery specification.     By virtue of being an Alternate Mode of USB Type-C, Thunderbolt 3   ports implement USB Power Delivery, allowing the ports to source or   sink up to 100 watts of power...   <comment336509> Darn. I thought V2 could deliver power. And from what I read, trying to charge from older USB is a bad idea. Stuck working from the iPad today.
