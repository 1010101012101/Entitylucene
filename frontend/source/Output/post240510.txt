Merge system and terminal clipboards <body> I experienced an issue starting from few days ago.  I cannot copy/paste (cmd+c cmd+v) from the terminal to other programs anymore, the opposite holding true. For instance, let's say I open my terminal, copy a path (highlighting it with the mouse then copying with cmd+c). I can paste it (cmd+v) anytime I want in any window terminal. I open another text editor, try pasting the path, nd it wont work. Then I find some bash code on the internet I want to test, I copy it with cmd+c, switch back to my terminal, try to paste it using cmd+v but it wont work the way I expected. It will paste the path I previously copied from the terminal, when I expected (and I want) to have pasted the internet code. If I go to any other text editor and use paste, it will paste the internet content.   Now it's like there are two clipboards, one for my whole system, and another isolated for my terminal.  Anyone knows how to solve this issue? I would like to have one and unique clipboard shared among all my system, terminal included. I cannot find anything related to clipboards in the terminal settings. Any hint on that?  <comment295627> Strange. The clipboard should be the same, globally - if you must, `echo "hello world" | pbcopy` works for copying to the global clipboard and `pbpaste` works for pasting. <comment295631> sounds like something is using the kill ring instead of the regular copy buffer. Try ctrl/k & ctrl/y instead of cmd/c cmd/v & see if your expected data might be there instead <comment295632> @perhapsmaybeharry: using pbcopy and pbpaste works well. But it is not that convenient as I have to write something like `echo "here is paste:$(pbpaste)"` to make use of it. I'd rather do the old trick with cmd+v which used to directly paste the content. Here I have to wait for pbpaste to execute.. <comment295633> @Tetsujin: I am not sure what I should do. I highlighted your name, used cmd+c to copy it, turned to the terminal and used ctrl+y: it simply pasted the last copy from the terminal as it does with cmd+v, but it did not print your name. <comment295644> ah, my bad. Terminal doesn't seem to be able to use the kill ring at all
