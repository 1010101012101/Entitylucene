Remap the 'UpperCase' key <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How can I set caps lock to a more complex keystroke?       I lost the tab key on my macbook and since i rarely use the uppercase key i'm wondering if it is possibe to use it instead by remapping or else?  http://i.imgur.com/zIKGll.jpg  I installed KeyRemap4Macbook but can't figure out how to do it.  Thanks a lot  <answer52301> In general, remapping a modifier key to another modifier key is relatively simple; Apple provides a system preference pane to do it. Remapping a standard key to another standard key is slightly more complicated, but easy enough by editing or creating a keyboard layout. The tricky part is converting a modifier key to a standard one, or vice versa. For that, you need a specialized program.  You will need a System Preference Pane called PCKeyboard Hack.  First, go the the strongKeyboard/strong preference pane, select the strongKeyboard/strong tab, and click the strongModifier Keys.../strong button. In the resulting sheet, set strongCaps Lock Key/strong to strongNo Action/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4E7s.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then, install strongPCKeyboard Hack/strong.  In the preference pane it installs, go to strongCaps Lock/strong, select "Change Caps Lock", and set the key code to 48 (the key code for the tab key).
