On creation of folder in a specified folder create sub folders in the new folder <body> I'm new to AppleScript and Automator. I have explored the different threads at Apple but unable to find something useful.  Well, my problem is that I have a folder i.e "work" I have applied folder action on it. On creation of new folder at "work" i.e "abc" I want to create three new folders in "abc". Check out my code   precodeon adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items   tell application Finder     repeat with this_item in added_items         make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Main"}         make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Lower"}         make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Upper"}    end repeat   end tell end adding folder items to /code/pre  <answer294855> The first thing I see wrong in your emcode/em is codetell application Finder/code, as codeFinder/code in this case is a emvariable/em, since it's not double-quoted.  It should be: codetell application "Finder"/code  That said, you have as Tags, emmacos/em, emmac/em, emapplescript/em and emautomator/em and did not state in the OP where and how you've applied the emcode/em to the emtarget folder/em, codethis_folder/code, as a strongFolder Action/strong.  In other words, if you've created the strongFolder Action/strong in strongAutomator/strong and have just that emcode/em as the emcode/em in a strongRun AppleScript/strong emaction/em, even with the double-quotes around strongFinder/strong, it will fail. That coding structure is only valid as an strongAppleScript .scpt/strong emfile/em assigned to a strongFolder Action/strong using strongFolder Actions Setup.../strong on the strongServices/strong section of the emcontact menu/em in strongFinder/strong.  The following emexample code/em is how I'd write it as an strongAppleScript .scpt/strong emfile/em assigned to a strongFolder Action/strong using strongFolder Actions Setup.../strong on the strongServices/strong section of the emcontact menu/em in strongFinder/strong.  precodeon adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items     try         tell application "Finder"             repeat with this_item in added_items                 if (class in (get properties of this_item) as string) is "«class cfol»" then                     make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Main"}                     make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Lower"}                     make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Upper"}                 end if             end repeat         end tell     end try end adding folder items to /code/pre  Note that even though by using the codetry/code emstatement/em, it should eat any errors, nonetheless, I've also added an codeif/code emstatement/em to make sure the emitem/em being acted upon is a emfolder/em, not a emfile/em. Note that while the codeif/code emstatement/em is not absolutely necessary, nonetheless, it's a more proper way to write emcode/em in my opinion, however, it could be left out if emyou/em want.  User's strongAppleScript .scpt/strong emfiles/em for strongFolder Actions/strong should be saved to, e.g.:  precode/Users/me/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/filename.scpt /code/pre  hr  If you are creating the strongFolder Action/strong via strongAutomator/strong, then in the strongRun AppleScript/strong emaction/em use the following emexample/em code_:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     try         tell application "Finder"             repeat with this_item in input                 if (class in (get properties of this_item) as string) is "folder" then                     make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Main"}                     make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Lower"}                     make new folder at this_item with properties {name:"Upper"}                 end if             end repeat         end tell     end try end run /code/pre  hr  Note that I have tested both emexample code blocks/em under the conditions stated above and it works as coded.  <comment372161> i have a folder in documents named "workdir" i applied folder action on it and in the workflow dragged the Run AppleScript utility copied your code and saved it but it is not working when creating a new folder in "workdir"
