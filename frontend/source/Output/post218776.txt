What's the the download size of Restore and Update for iPad via iTunes? <body> If you plugin you iPad to your PC and choose to reset it, and iTunes wants to Update and Restore your iPad, how much data will it download?  <answer218777> The download size (2015-09-12) is 2 GB.  I measured how much data iTunes used when I reset my iPad.  <answer224453> 1.8 GB for ipad (2016-1-22). Downloaded file actually locates in \AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\iTunes\Ipad Software Updates  <comment264518> This all depends on the version of iPad you are using, the country you are located in, and whether your device is Wifi only or Wifi and cellular. I would guess that the downloads average about 2Gb from previous experience.
