Very slow copy from CF memory card <body> I'm running Mountain Lion on MacBook Air, and using Trascend CompactFlash 400x 32GB memory card for my dSLR camera.  I tried to copy my pictures from the CF card using a USB 2.0 card reader and to move  3.74GB, it took about 4 hours. Isn't it too slow?  How can I fix this? Any workaround?  <comment116828> Fix the USB ? you need the USB 3 high speed <comment116854> 4 hours to transfer 32GB is about 3 hours and 30 mins longer than it should take, even on USB 2, Buscar. <comment116901> @tubedogg Thanks for the comment. However, I actually moved 3.74GB and it took 4 hours. I edited the question. <comment116920> Right - I unfortunately don't have any solutions to your problem, I was just telling Buscar it had nothing to do with the type of USB (USB2 vs USB3) like he was suggesting.
