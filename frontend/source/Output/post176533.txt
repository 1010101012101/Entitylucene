My internal "Machintosh HD" is not detected by my MacBook Air <body> I was trying to clean install OS X (from http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/how-clean-install-os-x-yosemite-via-bootable-usb-flash-drive-1470625).  I made the bootable disk, booted from it, and tried installing. Something happened and installation began. I went out for 20 mins and when I returned, I saw the installation welcome screen again. Proceeding on which I found that it came to installing it once again, but this time the internal Macintosh HD was not showing only the USB (Install OS X Yose..) was shown.  What to do? Where did my HDD go? any help?  <answer176540> Try and format the disk by using Disk Utility built into the installer (Utility  Disk Utility) then try and reinstall.  This should work since 'Macintosh HD' is only a volume and not the actual SSD. I used this method to fix the codeb-node tree error/code or whatever it is where I couldn't write to it.  <answer217312> I tried replacing the SSD and started it.  I pressed the keys combination of Internet Recovery and it worked. My Macbook is now working fine with El Caption installed. :)  <comment208629> I can not actually find that in Disk Utility. The only thing I can see in disk utility is the USB stick (from which the Mac OS X installer ran). <comment208659> Can you give a screenshot please? <comment208661> Also try using GParted. <comment210650> Hi! Thanks for the reply. I will give you a screenshot as soon I get to my office. <comment210741> Also when looking at the command they have missed the quotations and/or "\". <comment211497> @KumarRavi Cant see the screen shot yet :p. Also send me the output of this command (do it in terminal) `diskutil list`
