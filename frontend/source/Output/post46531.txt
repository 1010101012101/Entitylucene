Problem trying to install iftop via Homebrew <body> I got Homebrew installed, but:  precode&gt;brew install iftop ==&gt; Downloading http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop/download/iftop-0.17.tar.gz File already downloaded in /Volumes/0/z/Library/Caches/Homebrew ==&gt; ./configure --disable-debug --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/iftop/0.17 --mandir=/usr/local/Cellar/iftop/0.17/share/man ==&gt; make install ln: iftop: Permission denied Error: The linking step did not complete successfully The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local You can try again using `brew link iftop' Warning: /usr/local/sbin is not in your PATH You can amend this by altering your ~/.bashrc file ==&gt; Summary /usr/local/Cellar/iftop/0.17: 7 files, 116K, built in 3 seconds /code/pre  FYI, code~/.bashrc/code does not exist, and  precode&gt;$PATH -bash: /Volumes/0/z/android:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/X11/bin: No such file or directory /code/pre  What should I do? Thanks!  <answer46547> Have you tried using:  precode$ brew link iftop /code/pre  As the message recommended? Otherwise it's likely you need to be su to successfully create the symlink. Try:  precode$ ./configure --disable-debug --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/iftop/0.17 --mandir=/usr/local/Cellar/iftop/0.17/share/man $ sudo make install /code/pre  <answer46550> You can remedy things in your current shell by doing:  precodemkdir -p /usr/local/sbin export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/sbin brew link iftop /code/pre  That'll get you past the warnings and let Homebrew install the iftop package. If the iftop package is installing things in to code/usr/local/sbin/code that you're looking to run, you'll need to ensure this is on your code$PATH/code when you open a shell. To do this, edit code~/.bash_profile/code and add the line:  precodeexport PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/sbin /code/pre  To the end of the file to prepend code/usr/local/sbin/code to each new shell you open.  <comment53217> I fixed this by chowning all the folders in `/usr/local` <comment53219> I got it running by fixing permissions ... but is there any way to run `iftop` without `sudo`? Without `sudo` I get: `Permission denied` (I want to use this with GeekTool) Thanks! <comment53220> Nope. Binding to a network interface is a privileged action. Only super users can do that. <comment53222> Ah ... so no way to make it a Geeklet? <comment103510> Does `brew doctor` give back any problems? Also the fact you have permission issues is worth looking in to. <comment107742> Well... You could make your own script that gets run by a root cronjob, and puts the relevant data into a text file every minute. Then you could get geektool to read the file every minute... To create a root crontab, you just run `sudo crontab -e`. Everything you put in there will run with root permissions. <comment107744> iftop doesn't seem like the kind of program that could be run in geektool anyway. It needs to output static text, but it appears to run dynamically in curses. <comment135953> That package isn't failing for several people here. Have you isolated what is different on your setup? Is this still a problem that you haven't solved?
