Are there any autocompletion input tools for English? Except default TextEdit app <body> I'm a Mac user who is a Japanese. I usually type Japanese using Google IME  which enables me to type it with predictive texts so that we can type it faster.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UGnZK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Google IME  http://www.google.co.jp/ime/  In terms of English, I can't find good tools such as IME and a text editor. Does anyone know of one?  <answer167801> This question may have already been answered by How to setup predictive text (autocomplete) on Mac?, which states:     The closest things I've found to what you are looking for are this   text editor experiment that you have to compile yourself      http://alvinalexander.com/java/type-ahead-continuous-predictive-text-editor-auto-complete      And this Chrome extension for Gmail https://complete.li      Both would require you to type in their respective places and then   paste into your application of choice, but I haven't found anything   that works systemwide.   However, just to complete the answer, there is a IME type method built into strongTextEdit/strong, that can be activated by hitting the emESCAPE/em key, so if you type "beg" then the system will bring up a selection of words beginning with "beg", thus:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6vaW9.png" alt="IME in TextEdit"  However, the title of your question implies that you do not want to use that text editor. However, TextEdit is a system wide text entry mechanism so that particular functionality should be available in a number of text entry fields across the system.  strongEvernote/strong has an autocomplete system, that relies on the the MAcOS autocomplete.  There is another method, using strongEmacs/strong, which has an autocompletion mechanism. Again, though, it is tied to use within one particular application, although it is an extremely versatile application, if a little tricky to learn to use.  So, in summary, there appears to be no system-wide IME type functionality, apart rom the one built into OS X's TextEdit mechanism. To re-iterate the answer from Super User: you will have to type in a specific emIME friendly/em application and then paste into your application of choice   <answer271054> I developed an English Input Method for macOS.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AjZIa.png" alt="enter image description here"  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIxckfW Download the pkg file and install it.  http://blog.csdn.net/lwl_ls/article/details/8564940  version 1.3:  -input freely in any application of macOS.  -select automatically completed words by number.  -select the first suggested word with the Space key.  -enter the characters you typed with the Enter key. (E.G. "bea" in the example)  -remember user words automatically.   -support input space character automatically.  <comment196645> Google IME is a input method, the Textedit is a editor. what are you talking about? <comment196646> Sorry for my vague question.I prefer to use autocompletion as IME rather than a text editor.I'm gonna change the title of this question. <comment196769> Using Evernote is my blind spot.Thank you very much!
