Unable to login my MBP after removing Windows 10 bootcamp partition <body> After removing my Windows 10 partition via Boot Camp Assistant, I am not able to login into macOS anymore after I restart. After entering my password it will just hang for a while then should be the "Apple Logo" (the start up screen).   The login does verify my password, if I am not keying the correct password it will not hang.  Do you guys encountered such issue before? Can anyone shed some light?  <comment366845> It sounds as if you may have removed more than you think - you may be looking at a fresh install and I hope you have an up-to-date backup of your data.... But don't rush : someone else may have good advice, can you use another mac to look at your harddisk and check the remaining partitions?
