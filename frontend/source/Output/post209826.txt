Why does Pages insist on inserting objects at the center of my window? <body> Ever since the old days of MacDraw, the standard way to insert a graphical object (rectangle, oval, even textbox) into a document was to choose an appropriate tool from a palette and then click and drag where you want the object to appear.  That was how AppleWorks handled things, that was how Aldus Pagemaker handled things, that is how Microsoft Office handles things, etc.  But in Pages, to insert an object into a document you choose a command from the emInsert.../em menu, and an object of the type requested appears at the center of your window, usually right on top of some other content, which can make it difficult to (a) see, (b) click on, and (c) reposition / resize.  I find this incredibly frustrating.  Now I fully recognize that this might be just a matter of personal preference; I am sure there are people who hated tools palettes and like this new behavior.  I'd prefer this question emnot/em to degenerate into opinions about which way is better.  Rather, I have two specific questions:     What is the argument to be made (from a user interface point of view) for this method of inserting objects?      Is there a way (perhaps via some plugin) to provide "old-style" tools palette functionality in Pages?   <comment253098> Have  you suggested feedback to Apple: apple.com/feedback
