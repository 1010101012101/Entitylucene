How can I install Office from disc on iMac without SuperDrive? <body> I bought a new iMac, however it has no SuperDrive. I was given a gift of Microsoft Office 2011 (3 uses) in disc, but I don't have the money for external drive right now.  How can I install this program on my new computer?  <answer102373> If you can put your iMac on the same local network as another Mac with a CD-DVD drive, it should be possible to configure the two of them so that your iMac can share the CD-DVD drive on the other Mac.  Other than that, you would need to purchase or borrow an external USB CD-DVD drive and plug it into your iMac.  <answer102374> Microsoft has a policy of permitting you to download an installer for Office for Mac if you already own the installer DVD.
