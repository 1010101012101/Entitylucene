Why Homebrew is connecting to Google analytics and how to disable it? <body> I've noticed that when I run :  precodebrew update /code/pre  Homebrew is connecting to Google analytics. Why? And how to disable it?  <answer281787> According to the official documentation : Anonymous Aggregate User Behaviour Analytics     Homebrew has begun gathering anonymous aggregate user behaviour analytics and reporting these to Google Analytics. You will be notified the first time you run brew update or install Homebrew.   Why?      Homebrew is provided free of charge and run entirely by volunteers in their spare time. As a result, we do not have the resources to do detailed user studies of Homebrew users to decide on how best to design future features and prioritise current work. Anonymous aggregate user analytics allow us to prioritise fixes and features based on how, where and when people use Homebrew.   You can disable this feature with :  precodebrew analytics off /code/pre  or by setting  precodeexport HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1 /code/pre
