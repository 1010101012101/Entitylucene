Boot from CD unsuccessful - Mac OS X 10.4.11 Tiger, iMac G5 <body> I kind of am getting tired of Mac OS X Tiger, and I have decided I want to install Ubuntu on my iMac G5. I downloaded the ISO from this website. Then I prepared a CD. I TRIED to boot from the CD using the C key, but my Mac just did the normal Mac boot process, and I wound up at the Mac Login screen. Frustrated, I tried again. Then I tried to hold down the Option key while booting. All I got was a grey screen with a picture on a hard drive that said Mac HD below it. No CD. I am sure I made the CD right, using Disk Utility. Oh, I also tried using Open-Firmware, but when I did the keyboard combination, it booted straight into normal Mac OS X login screen.   Does anyone have any advice?   <comment353284> If the CD doesn't show up, either the drive is defective or the CD is not bootable. <comment353365> @patrix is 100% correct. You should test to see if you can boot from another CD/DVD (such as your Mac OS X Tiger install DVD). If you can then you know the drive is okay. If it is, then the question is _How did you create the bootable CD?_ On the other hand, if the drive isn't okay, then you need to access a known good optical drive to try booting from your CD again. If that doesn't work, then once again you'd have to look at how your created your bootable CD.
