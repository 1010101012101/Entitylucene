How to get a service working upon launch <body> A while ago, I wrote a few services and assigned them to key combinations. The problem is, even though services are under application's File menu item, I have to invoke it manually the first time, then I can use the key combination. Is there a way to be able use services when you first launch the application? I looked at this answer, but I'd rather use a 3rd party application only if I absolutely have to.  <answer271819> You can make this work with launchd. This requires two steps: First creating a script that invokes your service(s), and second creating a LaunchAgent plist file that will call the script at launch.  h1First step: Creating a script that invokes your service(s)/h1  ol liWrite a text file with the following content, where code~/Library/Services/myservice.workflow/code points to the service you want to start (if you want to start more than one service, repeat the second line pointing to the different services):  precode#!/bin/bash automator ~/Library/Services/myservice.workflow /code/pre/li liSave the file, e.g. as code~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.launchmyservice.sh/code/li liMake it executable by issuing the following command in the Terminal:  precodechmod u+x ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.launchmyservice.sh /code/pre/li /ol  h1Second step: Creating a LaunchAgent plist that calls the script/h1  ol liWrite a text file with the following content. You need to adapt the string code/Users/myusername/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.launchmyservice.sh/code so it points to the script created in the first step. You cannot use a relative path with code~/code.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;me.myname.launchmyservice&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Users/myusername/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.launchmyservice.sh&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the text file to code~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.update-desktop-from-webcam.plist/code â€“ the name should match the "Label" key in the file./li liLoad it by issuing the following command:  precodelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.update-desktop-from-webcam.plist /code/pre/li /ol  <comment340545> Related and possible duplicate:  [Keyboard shortcut for service only works after I manually run the service](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/260683/keyboard-shortcut-for-service-only-works-after-i-manually-run-the-service) <comment341696> This answer doesn't really apply to the question. The problem of the OP is probably a bug in macOS. Your answer may even work in some cases because the service is force-executed while logging in. Depending on the service this may result in unintended consequences though. <comment341711> It didn't work :(
