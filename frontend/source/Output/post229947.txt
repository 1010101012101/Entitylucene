How do I record HDMI input to a file with my Mac <body> So I have an HDMI signal and an HDMI to USB adapter. I need to record this HDMI signal to a video file. Zero budget. Will plugging this into my Mac work as a video input? If not, how else do I do this?  <comment280601> Presumably. Try it. <comment280632> Can you share the make and model of your device? <comment280659> Macbook Pro 13-inch, Late 2011
