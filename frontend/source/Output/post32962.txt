How can I make a file un-hidden permanently? <body> I have some files that were hidden on a PC. Now they live on my Mac. How can I remove the hidden property on each of these files?  <answer32964> In Terminal codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/code, relaunch  Finder. After that you'll see all your hidden files in Finder.   Now type   precodechflags nohidden /code/pre  into Terminal and just drag&amp;drop file that you want to unhide on the line. Enter.  codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE/code will reverse Finder back to normal.  <comment37684> Windows extended ACLs (like Read-Only, Hidden, System, etc.) don't translate 1:1 to OS X's HFS ACLs. Could you elaborate on this question? Screenshots/use cases/elaboration and all that are wonderful.
