Changing OS X command line language <body> On Debian I managed to change it using codedpkg/code and now UNIX commands, manual pages and supported packages are in my native language. Is there a way to do this also on OS X? I already have the locales set to my native language but everything is still english.  <answer96146> Terminal and iTerm set LANG based on the region selected in System Preferences (codedefaults read -g AppleLocale/code) by default. It affects error messages and (some) help messages shown by bash, but not the language used by nano or for man pages.  precode$ export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 $ ashuhuf -bash: ashuhuf: Kommando nicht gefunden. $ help unalias unalias: unalias [-a] Name [Name ...]     Entferne jeden Namen von der Aliasliste.      Optionen:       -a    Enferne alle Alias Definitionen.      Gibt immer Erfolg zur√ºck, wenn der Name existiert. /code/pre  Adding something like codeexport LANG=de_DE.UTF-8/code to a configuration file like .bash_profile would have the same effect. I don't know any way to make the shell environment more localized though.  If others were searching for how to make Terminal or iTerm use English, add for example codeexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8/code to .bash_profile. Disabling setting locale variables automatically would make shells use the default C locale, which makes working with non-ASCII characters difficult at least in bash and other programs that use readline.  <comment112856> I am curious what package you actually installed via dpkg and what language it gave you. <comment112858> @TomGewecke For example `ls --help` or `nano` are entirely translated. I am italian. <comment112887> Using `sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales` I was able to switch the language in existing installed packages. No need to reinstall anything. Is there something similar? <comment112916> I don't think that setting `LANG` in `.bash_profile` will make Terminal or iTerm use the specified language. That setting will only apply to the shell and programs run from the shell. <comment112921> @HaraldHanche-Olsen I could've phrased it better, but I meant like bash (or other shells or programs that inherit the shell's environment) in Terminal or iTerm.
