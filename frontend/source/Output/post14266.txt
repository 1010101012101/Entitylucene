Mac OS X Server 10.6.7: Disable Apache? <body> I'm doing some Rails dev, and I'm trying to get Pow running. After making the appropriate symlink, if I try to go to codeidealm_web.dev//code (codeidealm_web/code being the name of my Rails project), I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lqju1.png" alt="It&#39;s gorgeous, but useless right now."  I was told that this was Apache. How do I disable this? I checked under System Preferences  Sharing, and there was no way to disable it.  <answer14271> Turn off Web Sharing.  You might have to restart.  There are other ways of doing it also.  Keep searching.  <answer14276> You could disable the launch daemon.  I'm not an expert with codelaunchctl/code but the following command should work.  codesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist/code  <answer14278> If this is OS X Server (i.e. the server product, not the regular desktop OS), turn off the web service in either Server Preferences or Server Admin.  <comment15409> Yeah, it was in Server Admin - thanks! <comment125424> This worked for me and allowed MAMP to function properly on Mountain Lion. VPN however, ceased to work. It could be my fault, but just an October 2013 update on this for others.
