Resync Deleted iMessage From One MacBook to Another <body> Here's my scenario:  I have two MacBooks (macOS Sierra), one for work and one personal. On my personal Mac I accidentally deleted an iMessage with a friend. Lots of photos, etc. in that iMessage. However, I still have that iMessage on my work Mac. Everything is there.  I would stronglove/strong to find a way to sync so my personal Mac can get back the deleted iMessage with my friend. Is this possible?  Thanks!  <comment373863> Possible duplicate of [How can I transfer iMessage/SMS messages from Mac to iPhone?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/294231/how-can-i-transfer-imessage-sms-messages-from-mac-to-iphone) <comment373870> Check if you have 'save history' checked in prefs.
