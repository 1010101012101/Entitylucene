Can Safari show multiple tabs at once inside the same window (i.e. split screen)? <body> iOS now has a split screen mode to run two different apps in parallel. Many (text) editors have view modes to show 2 or more different views of the same document. Safari can show the Web Inspector next to the website it inspects. Websites are usually narrow and tall, physical screens are wide.  Can I somehow get Safari to show multiple tabs at once inside the same (fullscreen) window? It would be enough for a start if it was limited to the same page shown twice (e.g. for Wikipedia edit box and static article preview side by side).  JFTR, I know, of course, that I could open two Safari windows and manually align them next to each other. One of the few nice built-in features that Windows 7+ has and OS X / macOS lacks, is the automatic resizing and snapping of windows if dragged to the edge of the screen. I also know that there are third-party apps that replicate this behavior on Macs, but it’s not exactly what I want.  PS: I’m currently limited to OS X 10.11 El Capitan. I thought “Split View” was only introduced with Sierra, but it turns out it’s just hard to discover (as are so many of the power-user features nowadays).
