Command+Click does not work in Google Scholar + Firefox <body> For example, see this page: http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=cancer&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C33&amp;as_sdtp=  When I do kbdcommand/kbd+click on the article titles, Firefox does neither open a link nor open a tab. In any other browsers, it works well. When I do right click and manually choose "Open Link in New Tab", it works well.  Is this only my problem, potentially a problem of one of my extensions?  Firefox 21.0, OS X Mountain Lion  <answer93127> No, it's not a problem restricted to your computer:  ul liOther Mac users (including me) have experienced similar problems with emscholar.google.com/em and other websites when using Firefox 19.0.2 and version 20.0, or, in my case, with the same setup as yours (OS X 10.8.3 and Firefox 21)./li liWindows users have also reported this issue, for example here and here./li /ul  I don't think it is not a problem caused by extensions, either. The problem seems rather related to how Firefox deals with some CSS code and Javascript plugins.  strongThe extension NoScript can be used as a workaround/strong at the cost of reducing functionality, because it blocks, among other things, JavaScript.  After installing NoScript emscholar.google.com/em behaved as expected when I kbdâŒ˜/kbd-clicked the links. NoScript displays a yellow bar at the bottom when active:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NrEvb.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongImportant:/strong You will need to exclude emgoogle.com/em from the whitelist for this to work. This will also block Javascript and other plugins on emwww.google.com/em, so you may wish to whitelist it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l7B2M.png" alt="enter image description here"
