How do I unlock a .plist file so that I can change it? <body> I want to edit Info.plist for TextEdit. (Here's why.)  I'm running OS 10.7, and I do have Xcode installed.  But every time I try to edit the file, it's locked and I can't save my changes.  If I try to save it with Xcode, Xcode asks if I want to unlock it.  I say "Unlock", but then an error says codeThe file "Info.plist" could not be unlocked."/code; it says that this is because I codedo not own it/code.    If I open Info.plist using vi in Terminal (codevi Info.plist/code), I can't save changes even using code:w!/code.  The error is codeE212: Can't open file for writing/code.  How can I make changes to TextEdit's Info.plist file?  <answer68648> emBefore you do this make sure there are no running instances of TextEdit on your system./em  h1Using The Finder/h1  Select the plist file in the Finder and doing File  Get Info. At the bottom of the file info window you'll see a section called strongSharing &amp; Permissions/strong. You want to make sure you're in that list and that you have codeRead &amp; Write/code level access to the file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KzFPk.png" alt="Finder Info Dialog"  Before you can add yourself to the access permissions on the file though, you'll need to unlock it. Click the little lock icon (1) in the lower right hand corner and enter your password. If you're not an administrator on the machine, you won't be able to proceed past this step.  Once you've unlocked the file you can change your permissions to codeRead &amp; Write/code. If you're not shown in the list of people who can access the file, click the code+/code button below the list and find yourself in the codeUsers &amp; Groups/code list that pops up.  The changes are applied to the file as soon as you make them in the File Info window.  You should now be able to open, edit and save those edits to the file.  h1Using The Command Line/h1  Open a Terminal window.  Change to the place where the plist file is located:  precodecd ~/Library/Preferences/ /code/pre  Change the ownership and permissions on the file so you can read and write it:  precodesudo chown $USER aomDSP.plist sudo chmod u+w aomDSP.plist /code/pre  You probably don't need codesudo/code on the second call there, but it can't hurt. You'll need administrator access to the machine to do this.  <answer107454> If you want to edit the file (as you describe above), you don't necessarily have to unlock it. If you're fine with working on the command line, you may edit the file using the command line tools provided by Apple. Prepend the commands with codesudo/code to gain the required rights to modify the file (you will need to enter your admin password).  Namely these programs are codedefaults/code and codePlistBuddy/code (run as codesudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy/code). While codedefaults/code is a more direct way of modifying the file, codePlistBuddy/code has an interactive mode wich lets you preview your changes before saving.  Documentation for codedefaults/code  Documentation for codePlistBuddy/code  If required, you can also use codeplutil/code to convert between the different formats.  Remember that you can get help about all of these commands on the command line by typing codeman &lt;command&gt;/code (e.g. codeman defaults/code).  <answer206478> It did not work for me allowing the edit by unlocking the file. I had to duplicate it, edit and then remove the original file. Now I have my own default font.   <answer256058> The system does not allow for removal or replacement of the .plist  file.  <comment79760> The "Finder" instructions worked for me - thanks! <comment79801> TextEdit and other applications that use auto-save also need write permissions to the directory the file is in. <comment235302> Thank you very much for your answer. <comment319151> That's not necessarily true.  Please provide documentation in support of your statement.
