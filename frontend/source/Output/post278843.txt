iMessage deregistration issue <body> What should my course of action be if I try to deregister iMessage and it tells me "iMessage not registered for this number"? My iPhone is not functioning so I'm just trying to use an older phone but I can't receive a text from anyone using iMessage  <comment351087> Deregistering iMessage separates your phone number from iMessage.   Specifically, deregistering imessage will allow you to get your standard text messages sent to your phone number on a non-apple device.   It will not allow you to receive iMessages on a non-apple device.
