How can I fix my 1st gen iPad if I can't restore (error 3194) and have forgotten the password? <body> I googled to try to solve this, but changing the hostfile didn't work and using tinyumbrella didn't work either. I'm still getting the same error 3194.  <answer35240> I solved this error by deleting codeprivate/etc/hosts/code and rebooting my computer.   <comment60392> You generally don't want to entirely delete your hosts file - instead, edit it and remove any lines mentioning `gs.apple.com`.
