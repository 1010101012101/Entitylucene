How do I backup just a single user account with OS 10.10 Yosemite? <body> I have a MacBook Pro that will be securely wiped and reverted back to factory state, but I want to save just one personal user account and restore it after the wipe.  I don't think I want to use Time Machine to do the backup unless it can selectively back up a single account.  Is there a way to copy just that user account folder and have my settings, etc., preserved?  How would I restore it afterward?  <answer205306> ol liOpen Disk Utility application./li liFrom the Menu Bar select "File→New→Disk Image from Folder"/li liSelect home folder of the user account. Click "Image" button./li liIn "New Image from Folder" window enter:br Save As: Name for .dmg file that will be created.br Tags: Leave blank.br Where: Where to place .dmg file.br Image Format: compressedbr Encryption: none/li liClick "Save" button./li liIn the "Disk Utility" window, highlight the new .dmg file. From the Menu Bar select "Images→Scan Image for Restore"./li /ol     You now can mount the new .dmg file and access the saved files. You may have to use the codechown/code command to reassign ownership of any files copied from the mounted .dmg file.   h2Update 1:/h2  Personally, I would preform a backup of a users files while booted to a recovery partition or another partition containing OS X. Using internet recovery would also be preferable.   If you choose to preform a backup while logged into an administrator account, then choose to save the .dmg file to location where the user would normally have permission to save such a file.  For example, say I (davidanderson) open the disk utility and try to backup ronjanzen's files to the default folder code/Users/code, as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFjzB.png" alt=""  I would expect the following error message, because I do not have permission to create the file coderonjanzen.dmg/code in the folder code/Users/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f9BQ6.png" alt=""  Now, if I choose to save to my codeDocuments/code folder, then I will succeed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDUcC.png" alt=""  The other alternative would be to give read/write permission to the code/Users/code folder. If you do a "Get Info" from the Finder on folder code/Users/code, you get the following.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F0h0G.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you modify "Sharing &amp; Permission" as shown below, you will not get the above error message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x7nE8.png" alt=""  <answer205311> You can use time machine, then when you set up, use migration assistant. It will allow you to copy specific files (your user account).  <answer205582> All your settings are being kept in strong/Users/[username]/strong folder.  You can make disk image of that folder, or you can create archive from command line:  precode$ tar cvpjf [where you want to save archive]/[archivename].tar.gz /Users/[username] /code/pre  this command will create strong[archivename].tar.gz/strong file (compressed archive) in strong[where you want to save archive]//strong directory. It will contain all of the files found in strong/Users/[username]/strong.  Now, when you reinstall, get this archive, run  precode$ tar xvpjf [archivename].tar.gz /code/pre  You will get your old home directory back. Now, just make sure all the rights are ok (run it even if username is the same as on old system - numerical user id or group id might differ):  precode$ chown -R [your new username]: [unpacked directory] /code/pre  (might need admin password for that; don't forget ':' after the username - it makes sure that owner group is correct).  <comment248020> Can I configure Time Machine to exclude other user accounts? <comment248021> I tried this but after step 5, it said "permission denied" and failed. Any suggestions? I tried from two different admin user accounts. <comment248043> Yes. You can go to sys prefs  time machine  options, then exclude the user folders. <comment248055> @rob: I updated my answer to address your concerns. Let me know if you have any other problems. <comment248057> That won't work unless you've given the administrator permission to read the other user's files. <comment248068> @Kent, if you are already an administrator then a pop window will ask for your login password. If entered correctly, then you will be given permission to read the other users files. I did test this before posting it. <comment248075> Apologies!! I've had trouble with that in the past (on OSX Server) and have since resorted to the command line hdiutil or starting Disk Utility as root. Great to know that there's an easier way. <comment348230> BTW, `tar -j` creates a bzip2 archive but you gave it a .gz extension. Gzip is the `-z` switch. If you want a bzip2, you should use a .bz2 extension.
