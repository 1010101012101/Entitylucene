Open webpage on iPad from Mac <body> Is there an app out there that I can have on my mac that does the following:  Basically if I am on a website on my macbook, I want to be able to click a button on the browser and the same page to pop open wirelessly on my ipad.  <answer14581> You should check out Handoff.  <answer16234> Also check out prowl, and the browser add-ons that go with it. I use Send2Prowl for firefox.  <answer16238> Not natively, but as others have pointed out, some third party software does that.  In iOS 5, you'd be able to save it to a bookmark (or a "reading list") that will be synced automatically to your iPad through iCloud. That's the closest one I can think of. Just make a bookmark folder of "Open on iPad", and put it on your bookmarks bar.  <answer38099> Here's a list of options thus far.  ul liSafari's native Reading List/li liHandoff/li liProwl/li liAnsible/li /ul  <answer38100> Ansible is a good option.  <comment43189> I've been using Handoff for at least a year. I feel like the push notification used to be faster — almost instantaneous — but now there's a little bit of a delay between when I send the page and the push notification comes through. If I'm in the Handoff app on my iPad, though, I get it right away.
