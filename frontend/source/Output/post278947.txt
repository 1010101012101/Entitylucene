Directory highlighted in terminal <body> I just enabled coloring for ls command but for some reason few directories are highlighted, which bugs me because I don't know why.   Could someone tell me how to disable it or why they are highlighted?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8i44c.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodels -l ~/: drwx------   3 hungig  staff   102B Oct 20 14:06 Applications/ drwx------+ 12 hungig  staff   408B Apr  6 13:23 Desktop/ drwx------+  9 hungig  staff   306B Apr  6 23:24 Documents/ drwx------+ 14 hungig  staff   476B Apr  6 22:38 Downloads/ drwxr-xr-x   6 hungig  staff   204B Mar 27 16:59 IdeaProjects/ drwx------+ 67 hungig  staff   2.2K Jan  5 19:27 Library/ drwx------+  5 hungig  staff   170B Jan 28  2016 Movies/ drwx------+  4 hungig  staff   136B Jan 26  2016 Music/ drwx------+  5 hungig  staff   170B Feb  4 16:21 Pictures/ drwxr-xr-x+  5 hungig  staff   170B Jan 26  2016 Public/ drwxrwxrwx  16 hungig  staff   544B Mar  6 12:28 Qt/ /code/pre  strongEnv variables of interest/strong  precodeexport PS1="\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[m\]@\[\033[32m\]\h:\[\033[33;1m\]\w\[\033[m\]\$ export CLICOLOR=YES export LSCOLORS=ExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad alias ls='ls -GFh' /code/pre  <answer279050> The (background and foreground) color of the folder Qt in your emls/em output is determined by the last two pairs in your ls color scheme: ExFxBxDxCxegedabagstrongacad/strong because it's world writable.  precodedrwxrwxrwx  16 hungig  staff   544B Mar  6 12:28 Qt/         ↑↑         |but no sticky bit (a sticky bit would be indicated by a "t")         world writeable /code/pre  The last (=11th) pair colorizes strongdirectories writable to others but without sticky bit/strong.

To set it to your default directory color simply change it to ...Ex.  hr  Applying the posted color scheme (PS1 &amp; LSCOLORS and assuming user emDavos Doe/em = user emHung Hoang/em, who posted the scheme as well as the ls output in an answer, which got deleted and is visible to users with a reputation of ≥ 10,000 only) in a default Terminal shell I get almost completely different color effects though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/np4ak.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment351078> Please add your bash coloring scheme and the output of `ls -l ~/`to your question (as text - not as screenshot)! <comment351080> Probably driven by permissions, does `Qt` have other permissions? <comment351098> Please look at the output of `ls -lG /private/`. Is `tmp` has the same color?
