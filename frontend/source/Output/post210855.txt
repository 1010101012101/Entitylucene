How to turn off the Terminal's "Allow mouse reporting"? <body> Every time when opening an new Terminal window, the codeView/code - codeAllow mouse reporting/code is always checked. And everytime i must press CMD-R to disable it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vaziR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is here a way how to disable it strongby default/strong?  <answer214132> The strongView  Allow Mouse Reporting/strong menu item does not emenable/em the terminal Mouse Reporting behavior, it merely controls whether Mouse Reporting is emallowed/em.  This gives the user a means to temporarily bypass Mouse Reporting when it has been enabled by application programs, to interact with the terminal view for short periods of time. Also note that you can use the kbdFn/kbd modifier key when clicking, dragging and scrolling to temporarily bypass Mouse Reporting.  Mouse Reporting is not enabled unless application programs running within the terminal request it. Application programs normally do not enable it by default, and must be configured to do so. For example, to enable Mouse Reporting in Vim, one puts codeset mouse=a/code into code~/.vimrc/code.  If you do not want Mouse Reporting to be enabled, configure the appropriate application program(s) to disable it.  <answer234115> This bug can be worked around by default via an codeosascript/code command in your shell startup config (e.g. code~/.zshrc/code or whatever):  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "r" using command down' /code/pre  though this may need codeif/code statements to check if a) codeTERM_PROGRAM/code is codeApple_Terminal/code and b) perhaps not if codessh/codeing in from a not-Mac-using-Terminal.app to a Mac.  <comment258712> Great! Exactly i got bored with my `vim` and just found in my `.vimrc` the `set mouse=a`. (It was copied years ago from my linux box... and I forget about.) Thanx. Accepting, but anyway, would be nice to know how to set by default the "not allowed" (unchecked) state. <comment258713> No, there's no means to permanently bypass Mouse Reporting. Normally it won't be activated unless you've configured programs to enable it, so having a persistent preference to bypass it seems redundant. Usually if a program has enabled Mouse Reporting, it's because the user wants it. How is it that you had it in your Linux config, but don't want it enabled on your Mac? <comment311716> I've reproduced the OP's scenario where 1) there are no other applications running, 2) Terminal is started fresh, and 3) a fresh Bash session is launched from Terminal without running any applications from the shell prompt. When this is done on my El Capitan, the "Allow Mouse Reporting" option is turned up by default when a Terminal window is opened. That would indicate to me that the premise behind your answer in Paragraph #3 is incorrect. <comment312067> @Magellan Read the first paragraph. Allow Mouse Reporting is always on when you open Terminal. It is used to temporarily bypass Mouse Reporting by unchecking it. Checking it does not turn MR on—that can only be done by sending a command sequence to the terminal. <comment312122> That answer isn't as clear as you might think it is. For those who don't understand OSX and don't care to, but have to put up with it, it's a bit nuanced. <comment312306> @Magellan I don't think it can be described much more clearly without a longer tutorial. Are you saying you don't understand Mouse Reporting (aka XTerm Mouse), or that you don't understand the two different concepts of “allow” and “enable”? The main point is that there is no bug here. The OP has an application configured to enable Mouse Reporting. Terminal has ways to temporarily ignore Mouse Reporting so you can interact with the terminal view locally (e.g., select text), but MR cannot be activated unilaterally by the terminal—it must be enabled via escape sequences sent by applications.
