How to tell Finder where to find private key when "Connect to Server" using SSH? <body> In Finder, using the emConnect to Server/em option, I am able to specify the server I wish to connect to using codessh://user@server/code form (hostname or IP).  However, the server I'm connecting to requires public key authentication, thus Finder,when I press the emconnect/em button, responds in a new window:  precodePermission denied (publickey) [Process completed] /code/pre  How do I configure Finder to be able to locate my private key in ~/.ssh?  macOS Sierra 10.12.3  <answer277342> Finder in macOS Sierra appears to only add the id_rsa key by default. If you want to add other keys you either have to add them manually or alter the configuration.  on my machine a simple codessh-add ~/.ssh/test.key/code worked.    According to this guide you can also store the keys in your keychain:  In ~/.ssh create config file with the following content:  precodeHost * (asterisk for all hosts or add specific host)   AddKeysToAgent yes   UseKeychain yes   IdentityFile &lt;key&gt; (e.g. ~/.ssh/userKey) /code/pre  You can read more about this on the Apple Developer Site  <answer277347> You have to add your public key (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the authorized_keys file on the server. If you have no key/public key create one with:  precodessh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "user@host" #-C "user@host" is an optional comment /code/pre  If you have no access to the server you have to provide the public key to an admin and ask him to add it to the authorized_keys file on the server.  hr  Creating a config file as proposed in rwenz3l's answer is not required when you didn't enter a passphrase for the rsa key.  <comment349144> Whilst this worked, it did not open the server in Finder, which was my objective as I'm able to connect to the server from a terminal using SSH. <comment349263> @gone to my knowledge this is not possible since Finder only Supports FTP. If you want to actually mount SFTP in Finder, try SSHFS or a GUI variant like macfusionapp.org
