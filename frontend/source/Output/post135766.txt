OS X Mavericks screensaver changes pictures too quickly: How do I slow it down? <body> My screensaver pictures have quotes and sayings and the three or so seconds of transition between pictures that is built into the OS X Mavericks is far too short a duration to read the quotes and sayings. How can I slow the change rate to about 30 seconds per slide?  <answer149140> First check your current duration setting (usually it is set for 3 seconds)  Paste this in your Terminal (and provide password)  precode sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "print ':JustASlide:mainDuration'" /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Slideshows.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Content/EffectDescriptions.plist /code/pre  It will show you the current number in seconds, mine shows 3.  Next: paste following in to your Terminal to change it to let say 10 seconds (or any number you like).  precodesudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "set ':JustASlide:mainDuration' 10" /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Slideshows.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Content/EffectDescriptions.plist /code/pre  subSOURCE: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130215183522445 /sub  strongEdit: This solution no longer works as of August 9, 2016.

In the menu select Utilities  Terminal and disable SIP with the following command:  precodecsrutil disable /code/pre/li liReboot again and set slide duration to the desired value in seconds:  precodesudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "set ':JustASlide:mainDuration' 10" /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Slideshows.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Content/EffectDescriptions.plist /code/pre/li liReboot one more time into recovery (kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd) and reenable SIP for good measure  precodecsrutil enable /code/pre/li /ol  <comment161031> Look at [this](http://wiki.daveking.com/index.php?title=Change_The_Slide_Duration_In_Screensaver_%22Ken_Burns%22_Slideshow) <comment273066> Worked great, thanks. If you look at the preview it seems to not work - still switches photo every 3 seconds - but when activated, the screen saver takes your 10 second interval. Using Yoesmite.
