Local DNS server access delays <body> Access to a local DNS server is always delayed by ~1 second.  I enabled the DNS server on OS-X Lion and it does indeed work.  However when I query it using 'dig' (or nslookup) there is a delay of about 1 second before the reply is given. This delay is not reported by 'dig', which gives a response time of 0ms.   So for example a query using the OpenDNS servers completes sooner than one to the local server despite the name resolution taking 135ms longer:  $ time dig @208.67.220.220 ibm.com  ;; Query time: 135 msec  real    0m0.172s user    0m0.008s sys 0m0.006s  $ time dig @localhost ibm.com  ;; Query time: 0 msec  real    0m1.068s user    0m0.009s sys 0m0.007s  The delay does not seem to be in the named server, as when using named -g to view logs there is also a 1s delay before the request is printed.   FYI: my changes to enable DNS were:  rndc-confgen -b 256  /etc/rndc.confbr head -n5 /etc/rndc.conf | tail -n4  /etc/rndc.keybr edit /etc/rndc.conf to correct port numberbr edit  /etc/named.conf to add this to the options:  precodeforward first; forwarders {     208.67.222.222;     208.67.220.220; }; /code/pre  run named from the shell (/usr/sbin/named -g)  <answer54620> If you have code127.0.0.1 localhost/code in code/etc/hosts/code you also need to add a code::1 localhost/code line.  You may find that the delay has something to do with resolving the name 'localhost'. If you use 127.0.0.1 instead, the delay should be reduced to milliseconds.  $ time dig @127.0.0.1  muc.de  ;; Query time: 10 msec  real 0m0.029s user 0m0.007s sys 0m0.005s  I don't know where the resolution of 'localhost' occurs or why it takes such a long time, but I guess it doesn't really matter...
