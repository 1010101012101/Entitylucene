Key combination for selecting all the text in an edit buffer? <body> I need combination for selecting all of the text in an edit buffer for an editor like Sublime Text.  On the Windows OSes I would use kbdcontrol/kbd + kbda/kbd. On OS X this combination seems to moves cursor to beginning of the current line.  So how do I select all the text in the buffer?  <answer115345> Hahaha. The answer is simple: it is kbdcmd/kbd+kbda/kbd
