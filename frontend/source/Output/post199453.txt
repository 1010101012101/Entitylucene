IMovie error -50 <body> I am working in IMovie 7.1.4. When I try to export the movie I get this error message...br "The project could not be prepared for publishing because an error occurred. (Error code = -50)"  <answer199459> Error code = -50 would usually suggest a write error - whether permissions or an actual disk error I'm finding it hard to ascertain.  I would start by checking &amp; fixing Permissions &amp; Verify &amp; if necessary Repair Disk from Disk Utility.
