Reduce padding between menu bar items in Sierra? <body> Is it possible to reduce the padding between menu bar items? I'm mostly looking to reduce the space between the battery icon and the date.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uyFUw.png" alt="enter image description here"  I noticed on the OS X page at http://www.apple.com/macos/sierra/ the menu items are more condensed, and to my eye, look better. I'm assuming this is the result of some photoshopping versus a live screen shot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YHnSd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment347238> I wish this had an answer. I just upgraded to Sierra on my work machine, and the extra padding really stands out, in a bad way. It wasn't like that on El Capitan.
