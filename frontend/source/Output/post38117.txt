How do I play sounds from my iPad to my Stereo wirelessly? <body> Is this possible to stream the audio played on an iPad to a Stereo wirelessly ?  My stereo is connected to my iMac via BlueTooth. So If I can play the audio from my iPad on my iMac this will do what I want. But maybe there is another way to do it...  Another question is : Can I transmit the sound to my mac using the simple connector cable ?  What I really want to do is to use for instance GarageBand and hear the sound on my stereo. Wirelessly would be the best, but, as a second choice, I can handle the fact to be forced to be connected with USB.  And please, I know the ultime and last choice to use the mini-jack output on the iPad...  <answer38119> You can connect the iPad directly to your stereo using bluetooth. Or you can use AirPlay to stream audo to your iMac. However you cannot record anything while doing this:     While the "AirPlay - Bluetooth - HDMI" switch is on, an alert appears if you try to record an Audio Recorder or Guitar Amp Touch Instrument, or if you try to record a sound with the Sampler. You can turn the switch off from the alert.   From: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4622  <answer38133> If you wish to record via GarageBand on your iPad, then the only option currently is to connect it to your stereo using the minijack.  <answer38164> You can also stream iPad audio directly to a stereo, or amplified speakers, connected to an Airport Express or AppleTV 2.  <comment43184> shame OMG, I even didn't know that my iPad was bluetooth device! /shame <comment43194> I don't want to record.
