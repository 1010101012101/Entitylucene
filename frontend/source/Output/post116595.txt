Add a custom icon to OS X folder <body> This solution from Apple replaces the generic, blue folder with the specified graphic element.  Is there a way to add a custom graphic 'over lay' to the generic, blue folder?  Dropbox is an example of this.  ** edit **  I want to do this for one folder.  An alias to the folder should retain the icon as well.  I would prefer to do this without the help of a 3rd-party application.  <answer116596> You can do this with strongFolders Factory/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2b2XP.jpg" alt="Folders Factory Stamp"  supContacts might not be the best image for this, but you get the point.br You can also just overlay an image, or stamp a texture or text, but based on the Dropbox I guess this is what you're going for./sup  <answer116599> The simplest way of doing it is just making it yourself. And there is a quite emsimple/em way of doing it.  ol liSelect a folder which has the Generic icon./li liDo strongEdit / Get Info/strong or kbdCommand/kbd+kbdI/kbd./li liSelect the folder's icon, at the top of the emInfo Window/em, and copy it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9DD3M.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liOpen strongPreview.app/strong/li liDo strongFile / New from Clipboard/strong or just kbdCommand/kbd+kbdN/kbd. All of the actual icon's image sizes will appear. Select the first one as it's the biggest one. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/96xqI.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liCopy, from elsewhere, the image you want to use as emoverlay/em and paste it in the Preview document. For pasting it you'll have to click on the actual image, instead of Preview's selecting panel. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ePNG2.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNow, either after clicking in the preview's panel or the actual image, do strongEdition / Copy/strong./li liSelect the folder you want to change and do the emGet info/em thing as you did before./li liSelect the folder's image at the top of the info window and paste the new emicon/em by doing strongEdition / Paste/strong./li /ol  This is the final result: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BzzxN.png" alt="The result"  It's quite emnasty/em, from a designer's point of view, but it will definitely do the trick.  <comment136377> So that it becomes a default or just for a given folder? <comment136392> This assumes that there is a folder with the desired 'overlay' image.  If there isn't, this won't help. <comment136393> @craig No, you can use any image you want as *overlay image* Just copy and paste it on the preview's document. <comment136394> Is there a way to do this without this application? <comment136395> @craig Sure, you can just place a picture on top of the image and edit it yourself using Photoshop/Pixelmator/etc to recreate the stamp effect, but this is the simplest way. <comment136397> #5 produces 10 folder-shaped images of various sizes in Preview.  I don't understand what #6 means--I'm not able to paste another image. <comment136398> Those are all of the icon's different sizes. Just choose the first one. Copy an image from elsewhere, the one you're going to use as *overlay*. Then click on the folder's actual image, instead of the panel on the right, and paste it. Let me edit the post with some clarifying pictures! <comment136403> Awesome!  Love the icon choice, too.
