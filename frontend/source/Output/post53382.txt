Where can I find information on sales figure of Apple products? <body> I am carrying out some research into Apples product sales over the years. Where can I find information on their sales figures to date? I am looking for information regarding the number of products sold to date, sales of Apple accessories, their market demographic and any other details on who buys Apple products.  <answer53383> Apple discloses many of these informations with their quarterly reports. You'll find many sources discussing and analysing these by having a quick search in Google, but you'll also find the original announcements on Apple's website.
