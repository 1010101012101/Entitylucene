Apple keyboard remap keypad comma to dot? <body> Is there any way to change the key mapping of the apple keyboard?  As programmer I find annoying there's a comma instead a dot in numeric keypad. I would remap this key to have dot ...  <answer229523> One solution is Karabiner (prior to version 9.3.0, Karabiner was called KeyRemap4MacBook). It allows you to remap specific keys or change then entire keyboard layout, as described here.  It is a powerful keyboard remapper that can change not only the functionality of keys and key combinations, but just about everything related to how a key repeats when you hold it down. Keyboard remappings are highly customizable (although it's not a so simple process). You can change practically anything: you can search through all the options and quickly find what you're looking for, or just browse by category.  It's very powerful and usage is pretty straightforward.  The drawback is that keyboard remapping functions are predefined and you can just check them off. If you want to add custom remapping functions, you have to edit an XML file. When you're using a GUI application this is not exactly the ideal experience. That said, this is the only significant drawback.  <comment365088> Possible duplicate of [Decimal comma in Spanish keyboard layout](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2767/decimal-comma-in-spanish-keyboard-layout) <comment365095> Can you clarify which keyboard layout you are using? <comment365096> Italian kb layout
