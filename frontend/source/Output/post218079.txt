MacBook Pro 13-Inch Retina Mid-2014 slowing down badly <body> Recently I started facing issues with the web surfing and some features in the Mac OS X.   ol liFor the most of the web surfing I use Google Chrome, and a few websites like Facebook lag a bit on my computer. I can see keystrokes appearing on the display a little late and what not./li liWhen I fire up the "System Preferences" or say "Messages" from the dock, they take at least 2-3 seconds to show up the window - a few months back it was fine./li liI have tested some public Mac OS X builds, and now using the stable release of the Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.1. Has this impacted my SSD in any way? /li liI am learning iOS development, so I have Sketch, Illustrator, and Xcode loaded up in the Mac. /li /ol  Why my system is becoming slow? Is it because of the El Capitan, or something else?   Config: MacBook Pro Mid-2014, 2.6GHz Core i5, 8GB, 256GB. Also, I have an external display Dell S2240L monitor over the HDMI.  Additional Information: Memory Used: 6.41GB, Cached Files: 1.49GB, Swap: 874.0 MB. App Memory: 3.77GB, Wired Memory: 1.84GB Compressed: 832.3MB.  CPU Information: System: 6.53%, User: 13.38%, Idle: 82.71%   Disk Information: 128.87 GB free of 249.77 GB.   (The data shown above has two Chrome windows with 7 tabs, iTunes playing Music in the backend, and Messages app in the foreground)  Also, I don't know which logs to include, If you can suggest me which one to add up here, please do.   <comment263618> We'll need some information, how high is your cpu-usage in idle-mode, how high is your ram-usage, how much free space do you have on your ssd? <comment263621> Sorry for not adding them, I have now. <comment263824> I can't tell you how to find the exact problem but what should fix it is a OS-reinstall. You don't need to do much and can keep your data just on the drive. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314 see this for further information. <comment263901> Also, try resetting the SMC - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 <comment357664> In general it seems it OSX bloatware. I replaced my windows machine to a MBP 13 2015 and its running slow now. <comment357667> I also have way too many processes running in the mac. No idea what half of them do. Time to reinstall the OS.
