Turn off MacBook Pro's display while connected to external monitor on Yosemite <body> How do you turn off the MacBook Pro’s display with the lid open while using an external monitor on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite?  All the previous methods—such as the one’s listed here—that have worked on Mavericks no longer work on Yosemite.  Does anyone know the way to do this on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite? Turning down the brightness is not the same as turning off the display as the GPU still sends a signal to the internal display and the external monitor.  These were the terminal commands to achieve this on Mavericks:  h2strongEnable/strong/h2  codesudo nvram boot-args="iog=0x0"/code  h2strongDisable/strong/h2  codesudo nvram -d boot-args/code  Anyone know how to achieve this on Yosemite?  <answer154600> The equivalent command for Yosemite is:  precodesudo nvram boot-args=niog=1 /code/pre  I've only tested it on my Late 2008 15-inch MacBook Pro, but it works for me.  Your mileage may vary.  strongSource:/strong I read the IOGraphics source code, specifically codeIOGraphicsFamilyModuleStart()/code in IOFramebuffer.cpp.  strongTechnical details:/strong We need to clear bit 0 (codekIOGDbgLidOpen/code) in the module's codegIOGDebugFlags/code variable in order to change how it handles lid open events.  Previous versions of the code would set this variable to whatever value codeiog/code specified in the boot arguments, or code0x03/code if codeiog/code wasn't specified.  The code in Yosemite first sets codegIOGDebugFlags/code to code0x43/code, then bitwise ORs it with the value specified by codeiog/code (if it exists), and finally bitwise ANDs it with the bitwise complement of the value specified by codeniog/code (if it exists).  In other words, codeiog/code can now only set bits in codegIOGDebugFlags/code, but the new codeniog/code can clear bits.  So we specify codeniog=1/code in the boot arguments to clear bit 0.  <answer186598> Finally someone who realized a free app to disable monitors: DisableMonitor (on GitHub)  <answer188239> Go to screen saver then activate the "display off" in hot corners.  <answer192993> Found this wonderful free application :  https://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor/  Works like a charm.   <answer200579> This trick works (make the external monitor as primary one and partially close the lid till display goes off)  http://gizmodo.com/5938452/a-trick-to-make-using-an-external-monitor-with-your-macbook-way-better  <answer249280> Reducing screen brightness to 0 via the keyboard works for me - Macbook screen is totally dark, but the external display is not affected.  <answer269848> I have a magnet iPhone case, I put it near my old macbook's keyboard, near the ASDF keys, and the internal screen turns off immediately! It's so simple!

One would think this to be a feature by now. Ugh. <comment180974> I share you sentiments exactly, you would think such a basic feature would be included. Still holding out hope that someone will find a software workaround to this soon. <comment181066> Hi, agree experimenting with this I can get it to work only by closing the lid. As long as the laptop is plugged in it doesn't sleep. Thus you need a usb keyboard and mouse to quirk with this setup. A concession until Apple fully addresses the issue. <comment181127> Right, well that's intended behavior by closing the lid, using a usb kb and mouse. I prefer to keep the lid open for additional airflow as the heat that rises from the keyboard doesn't get trapped from underneath the closed clamshell. <comment181885> How do we remove this command if it doesn't work? <comment181902> @chance The same way as before: `sudo nvram -d boot-args`  Or [reset the PRAM](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18761). <comment181904> Brillant! Works! Thank you sir! <comment189121> This works once you boot. But only until the computer goes to sleep. Waking it back up turns the built-in display back on. <comment193144> 1) After putting in the terminal command, reboot and close the lid immediately 2) Keep the lid closed during boot up and once logged in, open the lid 3) The MacBook Pro's screen is off <comment210836> @RyanHeitner 3 steps work fine!

"Use at your own risk" yada yada. <comment298459> If you choose to mirror the external display (not add a separate desktop) this should reduce the workload <comment309156> Welcome to Ask Different.

At least the expected results are archived. <comment330231> @FredK After the display was disabled, it won't allow me to move the mouse to the *disabled* display anymore (expected result), turns out it does more than reduce the brightness to 0.

This fits my need when watching a movie for example. <comment361733> I like the magnet trick :))
