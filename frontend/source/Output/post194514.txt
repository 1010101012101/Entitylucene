What is a good style for documenting OS X hotkeys on web with markdown? <body> I often need to give instructions on using OS X hotkeys in documentation. I write it in markdown, usually on GitHub pages and sometimes on StackExchange. The keys are formatted with code&lt;kbd&gt;key&lt;/kbd&gt;/code = kbdkey/kbd.  In OS X interfaces the keys are usually listed together, with no spaces between. But OS X uses a well-readable font, so the string looks pretty.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wQlPq.png" alt="enter image description here"  But when rendered on a website, symbols don't always look good. So there are two options: to either write all keys in one tag, or each in a separate tag  h3Option 1./h3  precode* &lt;kbd&gt;⌥\&lt;/kbd&gt; = `«` * &lt;kbd&gt;⌥⇧\&lt;/kbd&gt; = `»` /code/pre  Resulting in  ul likbd⌥\/kbd = code«/code/li likbd⌥⇧\/kbd = code»/code/li /ul  h3Option 2/h3  precode* &lt;kbd&gt;⌥&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;\&lt;/kbd&gt; = `«` * &lt;kbd&gt;⌥&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;⇧&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;\&lt;/kbd&gt; = `»` /code/pre  Resulting in  ul likbd⌥/kbdkbd\/kbd = code«/code/li likbd⌥/kbdkbd⇧/kbdkbd\/kbd = code»/code/li /ul  Which is best? Should I maybe add code+/code symbols in between? (Which looks like a Windows-style to me).  h3Option 2a/h3  ul likbd⌥/kbd + kbd\/kbd = code«/code/li likbd⌥/kbd + kbd⇧/kbd + kbd\/kbd = code»/code/li /ul  <answer194518> I'm not sure it's set in stone anywhere, but the convention for Ask Different seems to be along the lines of  code&lt;kbd&gt; Cmd ⌘ &lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt; Ctrl ⌃ &lt;/kbd&gt;  &lt;kbd&gt; Opt ⌥ &lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt; Shift ⇧ &lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt; T &lt;/kbd&gt;/codebr kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd  kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd T /kbd   giving the abbreviated name &amp; key symbol, no + between  It's not as tidy as the Apple way, admittedly.  I'm not certain for 'key equivalents' but maybebr kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd \ /kbd = code»/codebr as your option 2.  BTW, I use System Prefs  Keyboard  Text to generate these quickly in Stack Exchangebr (which apparently only works in Safari, not Firefox or Chrome, see Replace text with predefined value in browser)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pA9Xb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment232040> What is the SE? <comment232042> SE = Stack Exchange - the site in its entirety.  For running order, I'm not actually certain. I've always used the order in which I would say them, or was told them when I first started, 25 years ago.. Cmd, ctrl, opt,shift - which echoes how Apple do it, but with cmd at the front rather than the back. I'm guessing they use that order as it would appear to be the symbol they line up to, but we don't have that option. <comment232044> thank you! I've just set up a replacement, and it works in native OS X apps, but not in others, e.g. the Firefox. Should I use Safari for this feature to work? <comment232045> oh, just found it here. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88870/replace-text-with-predefined-value-in-browser <comment232046> Ah - I hadn't thought of that. I've never used Firefox, but I just tested & it doesn't work in Chrome either. Seems to be only Safari recognises it correctly.
