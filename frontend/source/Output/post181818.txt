How do I enable Personal Hotspot in the OS X WiFi menu? <body> I have two Macs: my work MacBook Pro (retina, 15-inch, mid-2014) and my personal MacBook Air (13-inch, bought July 2013). Both are running OS X 10.10.3. When I click on the WiFi menu on my Pro, I see "Personal Hotspot":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jWajR.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's showing my iPhone 6, running iOS 8.3.  But I don't see that on my Air.  How do I enable Personal Hotspot on my Air?  <answer181820> The Mac and iPhone need to have the same iCloud account set up.   If they do, and it's still not visible remove the account from and re-configure it on the device that's behaving unexpectedly.   <answer215967> I have been trying to fix hotspot on my wifes iPhone 6 and MBA, it would not work most of the time.  I noticed the difference on mine that I had a hotspot section like above, where hers had her phone in the regular wifi section.  Signing out of iCloud on the mac and signing in again fixed it.  <comment216271> Under `System Preferences  Sharing` is **Internet Sharing** enabled on your Macbook Air? <comment216272> That's something else Ian <comment216273> Both Macs and my iPhone are using the same iCloud account. <comment216275> Mine used to have the same issue. I had to delete and re-setup iCloud on the mac. <comment216277> FYI, Internet Sharing is off on my Pro, on which Personal Hotspot works. (It's also off on my Air.)
