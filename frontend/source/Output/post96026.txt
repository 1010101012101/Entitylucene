In iPhone Configuration Utility error while exporting Configuration Profile <body> I create a Configuration Profile for VPN in iPhone Configuration Utility but when i try to export that profile i get error on console  precode*** -[__NSPlaceHolderArray initWithObjects:count:]: attempt to insert nil object from object[0] /code/pre  <answer130268> I got the solution of this problem by myself. What i was doing wrong is select sign the profile but i don't have any certificate installed to sign it. So i just select None from drop down menu and the problem has gone.
