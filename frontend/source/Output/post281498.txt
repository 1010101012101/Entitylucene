Macbook Pro 15" Late 2011 - Swap HDD with SSD - Fan always 2000 rpm <body> I installed a HDD+SSD setup on this MacBook Pro 15" Late 2011.  At first I installed the SSD where the Superdrive was with an adapter, but then I saw in System Informations - SATA that while the speed link was 6 Gigabit, the negotiated speed was 3 Gigabit.  So I put there the mechanical HDD, and the SSD where the HDD was. That way I'm getting way better performances (booting Sierra in 18 seconds, instead of 30 seconds when it was in the superdrive place).  The problem is that as soon as I make the smallest action (like opening Finder), the fans start going at 2000rpm (which seems to be the minimum speed on this machine) and you can always hear them in background.  When I leave the mac alone for 10 minutes, it turns quiet again (you can't hear anything) but as soon as I start the simplest application, there go the fans at 2000rpm.  That's strange because my other MacBook Pro (mid 2010) is always quiet while I work, you start hearing the fans only under load.  What I already tried:  ul liResetting PRAM/NVRAM and SMC/li liUsing all popular fan control programs/li liChecking the temperatures (always very low)/li /ul  Sierra is a clean installation.. What am I missing? One thing that I like in Macs is that you never hear the fans while you work.. I'd like it to be like that.
