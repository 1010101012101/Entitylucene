Must I reformat my hard drive to reclaim space from unused 2nd partition? <body> I wanted to see if I could also have Ubuntu on my Macbook alongside the usual OSX. Now, a year later, I want to remove the Ubuntu and the space associated with it on the hard drive. That is, my hd is partitioned into two separate spaces.   My question is, if I want back the space that Ubuntu took, must I reformat and delete everything on my Mac?   <answer113601> You won't need that, you can delete your Ubuntu partition and expand the current OSX one.   Using Disk Utility :  ul liChoose your hard drive/li liUnder the Partition tab/li liDelete your ubuntu partition and expand the OS partition. /li /ul  <comment133298> Are you sure? I think I tried that and didnt work. Ill try again now. <comment133302> It usually works.  But if Disk Utility is not allowing it in your case, then you probably *do* have to reformat. <comment133347> Or: you can boot a live Ubuntu CD/USB stick, and use GParted to delete the Ubuntu partition. Then reboot back in OS X and expand the OS X partition with Disk Utility.
