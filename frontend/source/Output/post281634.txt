All sorts of icons are blurry and broken looking <body> Recently, I downloaded a VPN app. It's icon appeared as normal for a second, and then became quite strange looking. After a while, this problem started to spread to the icons of other apps as well as icons within the apps. Is this a virus, or corrupted data or what?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JKThY.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pj82B.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment354361> What's the name of the VPN app? <comment354368> I forget, otherwise I would have mentioned it. <comment354373> Is there a way you could find out (like looking in your downloads or applications folders? We can't tell you if it's a virus if you can't tell us what the name is
