How can I reset my bash configuration? <body> When I open Terminal it shows this:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeLast login: Fri Apr 1 17:04:59 on ttys000 -bash: export: /opt/local/bin': not a valid identifier -bash: export::/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/X11/bin': not a valid identifier Josh@Macbook-Pro~$ export /code/pre  I installed something yesterday and modified bash_profile. Now I cannot do anything in Terminal. Even "ls". It returnsâ€¦  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codebash: ls: No such file or directory /code/pre  How can I fix it?  <answer11229> Sounds like it's screwing up your PATH, so the shell can't find any of the usual commands.  In this case, you can still use the commands by specifying their entire path (e.g. code/bin/ls/code instead of just `ls), or just reset your PATH manually:  precodePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/X11/bin /code/pre  (Note that that's based on the error you gave; there may be some directories missing.)  If .bash_profile is the only thing messed up, it's probably easiest to just disable it:  precode/bin/mv .bash_profile bash_profile_disabled /bin/mv .bashrc bashrc_disabled /code/pre  ... and then open a new (clean) Terminal window, and then look through the file to see if you can undo the damage before renaming it back.  <comment11736> We need to see what file was modified, and it'd be great if we knew what "something" was that you installed. You can use [Secrets.prefpane](http://secrets.blacktree.com/) to show hidden files in Finder, then open up ~/.bash_profile, or .profile, or .bashrc, or what have you in your favorite text editor, then copy/paste into here. <comment57391> THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!
