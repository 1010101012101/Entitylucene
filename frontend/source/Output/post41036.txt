How do i do it?!/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cc2uq.png" alt="enter image description here"  The above form is locked and there is no accept button what so ever.   Any tips and/or pointers will be highly appreciated.   <comment46452> Questions about programming, development, and listing your apps on the App Store are off topic for Ask Different. <comment46453> Although we do have several developers that frequent the Ask Different site, [currently](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1038/what-would-happen-if-we-expanded-the-scope-of-this-site-to-include-itunes-connec) the Developer Program and general development questions are [off topic here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq). Would you like me to migrate this to the main SO page if you can't get an answer on chat there? <comment46455> Yes please migrate this question. <comment46462> I did migrate it and on checking with SO - they really are closing as well questions on the working of NDA covered issues so I can't seem to find a place where this is on-topic. I suppose you'll have to reach out on the developer forums at Apple or deal with their email support. I wish I had a better idea for you other than refreshing the browser and hope it renders the submit button eventually. <comment46477> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6958638/how-to-accept-the-latest-ios-developer-program-license-agreement
