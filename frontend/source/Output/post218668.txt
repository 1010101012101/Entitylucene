Why do different resolutions with same aspect ratio distort the image on external display? <body> I attach my MBP (OS X 10.10.4) via VGA to my tv and the aspect ratio is correct when setting an code1360x786/code resolution, which is a 1.77 aspect ratio. But when trying to increase the resolution to code1690x944/code, also 1.77 aspect ratio, the image is distorted. Now I wonder how that can be the case given the ratio between height and width is identical.  <comment264354> Are you certain you are actually getting the resolution you are asking it for? My first guess would be the TV can't cope with one of them & is actually doing something different. <comment264355> No, I'm actually not sure and thought of the same. But how can I verify this? <comment264356> My TV displays the resolution as it changes, but only in 'TV terms' 720i 1080p etc. Not sure how you would interrogate it, especially over VGA. <comment264361> Check your settings for overscan and underscan on your TV. <comment264362> Unfortunately, the UI is quite limited and contains no such settings. It's a cheap tv.
