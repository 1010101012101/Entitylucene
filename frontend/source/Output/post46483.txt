How can I rebind the return key so that it works consistently across all applications? <body> I tried rebinding my keyboard with Ukelele to switch the kbdreturn/kbd key with the kbd'/kbd key. This works fine most of the time. There are just a few websites (that I've found so far) that aren't compatible with this change:  ul listrongFacebook/strong: Sending IM messages no longer works./li listrongGoogle Docs/strong: Does not allow you to insert new lines when editing word documents./li listrongStackExchange/strong: Pressing kbdshift/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd at the end of a bullet list does not insert a new bullet./li /ul  How can I get this rebinding to work flawlessly everywhere in the operating system?  I'm using Chrome 18.0 beta.  These are the applications I've found which don't recognize the return key after rebinding it:  ul liChrome/li liMicrosoft Word (specifically when a dialog is open and the OK button is the default button. Pressing return should be the same thing as clicking the OK button)./li liJava apps/li /ul  <answer46484> You probably need to step a level further down the tree of software and hardware, to the level of KyRemap4MacBook - which acts as a filter between the physical keyboard and the keyboard events reported to MacOS.  The software keyboard map is an optional thing - software can intercept keyboard events at a level that bypasses it, if they wish, and it sounds like some of what the browser does with key binding is touching on that.  A lower level remapping may bypass that problem.  <answer46713> So far, it looks like it is a bug in Chrome. When I try to do the same thing in Safari, it works just fine. Here are the results of a simple test I did.   Definitions:  ul liCustom keyboard: this is exactly the same as the normal keyboard. The only difference is that I used Ukelele to swap the kbd'/kbd and kbdreturn/kbd keys./li liReturn key code: outputs the Javascript key code that shows up when the physical kbdreturn/kbd key is depressed. /li liLikewise, codeQuote key code/code refers to the key code when the key with the kbd'/kbd symbol is depressed./li /ul  Results:  precode+----------+---------+-----------------+----------------+ | Keyboard | Browser | Return key code | Quote key code | +----------+---------+-----------------+----------------+ | Normal   | Chrome  |              13 |            222 | | Normal   | Safari  |              13 |            222 | | Custom   | Chrome  |             222 |            222 | | Custom   | Safari  |             222 |             13 | +----------+---------+-----------------+----------------+ /code/pre  Notice how Chrome and Safari's behaviors differ. Since the kbd'/kbd has been changed to kbdreturn/kbd, Chrome should be sending code13/code instead of code222/code when that key is depressed.  <comment53475> Please report the bug at http://new.crbug.com/ and link back to it here, so that it can be fixed!
