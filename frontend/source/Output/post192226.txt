OSX Server Cannot Find itself <body> Everything was working perfectly last week when I left it and no-one (accessible by only 4 people in our IT department) has touched it.  Okay, we use OS X server and Deploy Studio to manage our apple devices. Today, however, deploy Studio was not reachable. I could Netboot a Macbook to the Deploy Studio Assistant, but upon logging in the server and repository could not be reached.  Now I then went to check in settings and open the URL of the repository but, again, server cannot be found. I restarted the service and it would not finish config. Restarted and had the same issue (also said repository cannot be found).  Then I tested Profile Manager. I opened the link on the server itself and 'Safari Can't Find the Server'.  Does anyone know what might cause this? I did renew push certificates last week but everything was running smoothly and no other changes have been made.  Thank you!  <answer192703> Seems someone had been fiddling with the DNS server :) All good now!  <comment228570> This question's title almost sounded philosophical. <comment229402> Dude :) Have done some more testing and it seems the server's name is not being resolved. So, I guess the server more doesn't know who it is anymore.
