How to prevent burst photos in camera timer? <body> ul liI can tap the upper-central "live photos" (short video) icon button to assure live mode is disabled. /li liI can assure I'm switched to "Photo" and not "Video" or "Square" or whatever. /li liI can tap HDR to "auto" or "off" ("on" is not available for front-facing lens). /li liI can set the timer to three seconds or ten seconds./li liI can try rear-facing or front-facing lens. /li liI can try a short tap, long tap, or double-tap of the shutter button. /li /ul  But I can't seem to stop the "burst photo" mode when using the timed photo option.   I don't want to have to choose between ten "burst" shots for every single timed snapshot I take.   I also looked in device Settings / Photos &amp; Camera, and I don't see anything relevant there.   Am I missing something? Thank you.   iPhone SE  iOS 9.3.2  <answer239496> The only way to stop burst mode during timer photos is to turn the flash codeOn/code.  When the flash is codeOn/code the camera will only take 1 picture.   My recommendation is to provide feedback to Apple here and let them know how you feel about this limitation.  <answer252004> With my iPhone 4S I used to put the timer on 3 sec in order to be able to hold the camera steady for sharper photos. Now I have the iPhone 5S with iOS 9.3.5, and detected the atomatic burst mode when using the timer on 3 sec. Very annoying! TEST I've switched on also HDR (together with the timer on 3 sec) and the burst mode disappeared.  Result only 2 photo's:  the first is a 'normal' photo [1,24 MB] and  the second is the HDR-photo [1,15 MB].  For me this solution is O.K.  But it would be nice if you could switch of the burst mode altogether.  <comment294800> Thank you. It seems also turning HDR to "on" prevents bursts, but that's only available for rear-facing camera, unfortunately.
