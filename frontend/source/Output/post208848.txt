Install John the Ripper Jumbo <body> I've been following the instructions here for installing John the Ripper on my Macbook Pro (El Capitan). I've skipped the Iterm and Cuda sections (I have a Redeon GPU).  All is well until I run  precodemake clean macosx-x86-64 /code/pre  Which gives me the error:  precodegcc -c -Wall -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -Wdeclaration-after-statement -I/usr/local/include     -m64 -Wno-deprecated-declarations -funroll-loops dynamic_fmt.c In file included from dynamic_fmt.c:69: ./sha.h:4:10: fatal error: 'openssl/sha.h' file not found #include &lt;openssl/sha.h&gt;          ^ 1 error generated. make[1]: *** [dynamic_fmt.o] Error 1 make: *** [macosx-x86-64] Error 2 /code/pre  How can I get it to compile?  I've read that it is better to use CommonCrypto API instead of OpenSSL. However, I'm not sure how to go about doing this. Is there a better solution?  <answer208863> You are missing the header files.  If you have brew installed you can:  precodebrew install openssl libyaml libffi /code/pre  <answer209001> I had more luck using the latest Jumbro version (1.8.0.6).  To retrieve and compile:  precodegit clone https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper jumbo cd jumbo/src ./configure --enable-mpi /code/pre  Note there is no need to edit the Makefile to enable the MPI any more - the above command will get everything ready for building.  precodemake clean /code/pre  Boom - everything now working.  <comment251852> Just tried it. However, I get the same error. <comment330027> Frick, I've been fighting with one of their releases for hours and cloning trunk worked immediately. /facepalm. Thanks.
