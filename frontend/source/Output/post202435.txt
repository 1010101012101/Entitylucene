Any backup software for OS X other then Time Machine? <body> Time Machine will not backup external disks connected to it. I need to backup connected external disks. I have a pile of backup disks in their default formats. Buffalo, WD mostly as backup disks. My external drives include USB drives etc.  Are there any substitutes for Time Machine?  <answer202436> strongrsnapshot/strong  If you really don't want or cannot use Time Machine, you should look into rsnapshot. However, this solution will be much more complicated than using Time Machine. This guide explains the procedure of setup:  ol liUse homebrew for setup: codebrew install rsnapshot/code/li liNext you will have to configure its settings in codersnapshot.conf/code/li liNow you can run it somewhat like this: codersnapshot -c rsnapshot.conf hourly/code/li /ol  There is many more guides on how to setup rsnapshot in the internet.  strongTime Machine/strong  Time machine can actually backup external drives. However, external drives are excluded by default. Go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Time Machine &gt; Options.../code and remove your disk from the exclusion list (while the drive is connected). Also the external disk will have to be formatted in HFS+.  <comment244178> Judging from your comments to my answer, I think you need to give some more details on your setup and actual problem. <comment244200> You could also take a look at SuperDuper http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/13803/superduper! and Carbon Copy Cloner http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/7032/carbon-copy-cloner   I've used both but settled on SuperDuper as it does everything I need with a very simple UI <comment244224> @amergin Good point. However with neither of these you will get a version history. <comment244226> Version history is not necessary. Git is for that internally.
