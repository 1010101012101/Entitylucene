Cannot press Shift+T in OS X <body> Since a few days, I am not being able to press kbdT/kbd and any other key on my Wired Apple Keyboard. Nothing happens when I press kbdShift/kbd and kbdT/kbd. Keyboard shortcuts like kbdCmd+Shift+T/kbd don't work. kbdCmd+T/kbd works.  To get a capital T, I need to turn on kbdCaps Lock/kbd or copy and paste it from somewhere.  I enabled Verbose Boot by setting the kernel flags a long while ago. Maybe at the same time when the key stopped working right[1], after 20 lines of text the verbose boot kept typing in the code$/code character automatically until I pressed any key on the keyboard.  I can fix this by attaching a non-Apple Keyboard, setting its layout and unplugging it, after which the Apple Keyboard starts working perfectly (which means there is no hardware problem). But when I reboot the key stops working again.  Also trying to press kbdShift+T/kbd in verbose boot does nothing, while other keys show up fine. kbdShift+T/kbd doesn't even work in Safari in Recovery Mode. I also can't reset the NVRAM by pressing kbdCommand+Option+P+R/kbd, it just takes me to recovery mode.  [1]: I don't remember doing anything except setting up oh-my-zsh around this time  <answer191774> Try the following:  ol liOpen the "Keyboard" preferences pane/li liIn the "Keyboard" tab, turn on the "Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar" checkbox/li liGo to the new menu (it looks like a box with a command key clover-leaf in it) and choose "Show Keyboard Viewer"/li /ol  You'll now see a window shaped like your keyboard, with every key shown, and each pressed key highlighted. Try out all the keys, especially the "t" and modifiers. Note that holding down "shift" will change the key display to capitals, and holding down "option" will change the key display to alternate characters. This should let you track down the problem, if it's in hardware.  <comment227812> Ever consider your keyboard itself may be damaged? <comment227813> Also check out [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22348/shift-t-not-working-on-apple-wireless-keyboard). <comment227868> I tried it already, all keys work fine when individually pressed. When I hold Shift, I can see it on the screen but when I press T, nothing happens. <comment227869> No hardware problem. Updated question. <comment227904> So, "T" works, "Shift" works, but "Shift-T" doesn't? Do you get the same result with either "Shift" key? And, do you have a keyboard macro program running that might be causing this? <comment227907> Have you double checked the system preferences for things like speech to make sure this combo has not been set as a trigger for some function? <comment227968> Yes, yes, no. Even in recovery mode I can't press shift t. It is not a hardware problem as I can fix the problem until the next boot by plugging and unplugging a non-Apple keyboard. <comment227969> Yes. Even in recovery mode, pressing shift+t does nothing.
