What are the most convenient keyboard/keyboard layout for programming? <body> I do a bit of Objective-C, Matlab and Python, and start to get tired of the keyboard I use (AZERTY). It is far from being optimal as one need to press kbdALT/kbd+kbdSHIFT/kbd+kbd(/kbd to get kbd[/kbd for example. I think of buying a new keyboard for programming and QWERTY keyboards seem to be an obvious choice (my guess is that these language/environment were developed with such keyboards).   Which keyboard/keyboard layout allow a direct access to programming keys, such as kbd[/kbd, kbd{/kbd or kbd|/kbd for example?   <answer150707> Most people use QWERTY, just because it is the most popular, but if you’re learning a new layout anyway you might want to try Dvorak.  If you don’t want to learn another alphabetic layout, you can use a tool like Ukelele to make a better programming layout for the special characters while still keeping AZERTY for the rest of the keys.  <answer160246> You can try Colemak.  It is less different from QWERTY and AZERTY then Dvorak so you will have the most used keyboard shortcuts kbd⌘/kbd+kbdX/kbd, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdV/kbd in same place and kbd⌘/kbd+kbdQ/kbd, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdA/kbd, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdZ/kbd on the left side identical to QWERTY (though not AZERTY).  kbd[/kbd, kbd]/kbd, kbd{/kbd, kbd}/kbd and kbd|/kbd are at the same places as in QWERTY.  Also check typing effort comparison of QWERTY, Dvorak and Colemak.  <answer282319> I made a custom azerty keyboard layout for this: https://github.com/r03/azerty/  The layout is a combination of the normal Belgian azerty and the Apple azerty.  I also mapped the {} keys to an easier location next to the enter key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nRONd.png" alt="Keyboard Layout"  <comment177374> Which keyboards will let you type [] and other common symbols used in programming with the less effort than French/Belgian Azerty seems more like a question of fact rather than opinion, so perhaps the hold is not needed. <comment177433> @Tom Gewecke - couldn't write a better comment than yours - and can't see how to formulate a more factual question (will try though). but it seems that my three-finger combos are an opinion! <comment177458> Dvorak indeed ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard)). There is even a French speaking group promoting a keyboard dedicated to both writing/programming (called BEPO).
