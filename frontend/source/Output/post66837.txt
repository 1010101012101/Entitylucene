Shortcut to Clean up folder by Name? <body> I would like to create a keyboard shortcut to Clean Up Folder by Name. Which can be done by right-click  Clean up by  Name   What is the Automator code needed to achieve this ?  <answer66838> On my Mac (running 10.7 Lion), there's already a default shortcut for this, ⌥⌘1 (kbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbd1/kbd). You can access the strongClean Up By/strong menu under the Finder's strongView/strong menu, which will show the shortcuts assigned: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u1CSp.png" alt="Clean Up By menu"  iNote that this option is only available on the Desktop or a Finder window in emIcons/em mode (not List, Column or Cover Flow modes)./i  If you don't have shortcuts assigned by default, you can add them in the strongApplication Shortcuts/strong section of strongKeyboard Preferences/strong.  <comment78728> Thats perfect. However I have a question, how do you have shortcuts showing beside the options ?? I Do not have that (hence I asked this question) - Mountain Lion OSX 10.8.2 --- EDIT oops I was looking by right clicking .. apparently clicking on the menu bar shows the shortcuts
