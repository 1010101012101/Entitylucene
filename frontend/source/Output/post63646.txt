Cannot access backups in Time capsule <body> I have a Time Capsule which I originally used with a MacBook Air running Snow Leopard. Now I purchased a new MacBook Air with Lion and am trying to transfer my old backups on the Time Capsule and I cannot access the backups (dating at least for over a year), the last one shown being on the date I configured the new computer.  I have tried using the "Browse other backup discs" option and I find only the same situation. Are my backups still available or where they erased once I installed the new Macbook Air and tried to connect it via Time Machine with the Time Capsule? Is there any way I can continue using the Time Capsule the same or would it be a separate backup where I cannot access the old ones?
