Spotlight won't find apps after AppStore updates them <body> This started happening with Type2Phone, an app from Houdah Software. Every time after I would update the app via the AppStore, Spotlight would no longer find the app (I use Spotlight for app launching). I contacted the developer, and following a series of steps, we found that what is happening is that somehow the updated app is having this attribute added to it:  precodekMDItemSupportFileType            = (     MDSystemFile ) /code/pre  [This is the output of the mdls command]  This explains why Spotlight is no longer finding the app.  Now logically, he informed me that this command should remove the attribute:  precodesudo xattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemSupportFileType /Applications/Type2Phone.app /code/pre  But although the command executes, it doesn't remove the attribute! I.e.  precodemdls /Applications/Type2Phone.app/ | grep MDSystemFile /code/pre  Still has codeMDSystemFile/code as output.  I've run Disk Utility to check for directory damage, rebuilt permissions, etc. to no avail. The only solution is to rebuild the Spotlight index completely -- but the problem will recur with a new update.  Although it inexplicably only happened every time I updated Type2Phone, now it's happening when I update Tweetbot.  Any insights into this problem which is driving me batty?  <answer101112> I had the same problem with Outbank.app which was driving me nuts, as well.  After a wile I found this site where I was told that emwriting/em the attribute with codexattr/code actually updates the spotlight metadata. So,  precodesudo xattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemSupportFileType "" /Applications/Type2Phone.app  /code/pre  should do the trick.  <comment119147> Yes, this did the trick! Thank you so much! <comment131355> I have the same problem, but the command isn't fixing it for me. What does it mean if the attribute is missing or empty when printed with xattr but still a "system file" according to `mdls`?
