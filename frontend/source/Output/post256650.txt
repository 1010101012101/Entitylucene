I don't know what to do; I can't update my software.  I hope you can help me.  <answer256651> Launch Terminal and type the following command if  you are running macOS Sierra:  precode open `getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR`/com.apple.appstore /code/pre  Move all the files and folders out of com.apple.appstore. Then relaunch Mac App Store.  You can delete all the files and folders later if Mac App Store works well. â€‹  <comment320161> Welcome to Ask Different.

It's different in everyone's Mac. So I can't give the exact path. It's the quickest way to find the folder with command.
