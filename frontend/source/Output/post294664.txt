My iPad mini 4 randomly turns off when i shake it! <body> Also when it reboots on its own WiFi is greyed out but when I reboot again (home button+power) wifi comes back. The iPad is 16GB WiFi &amp; Cellular out of warranty. I feel like there is a problem with the internals! I have iOS 10.3.3 on it. Sometimes it also happens when i press too hard on the screen  <answer294672> You're holding it wrong! - Stop shaking it!  Seriously - you're experiencing problems with defective hardware. Take it to a proper repair shop and get a fixed price on fixing the issues.  You should probably prepare for the fact that buying a new iPad is cheaper than repairing the old.  <comment371931> What is your question?
