How do I make passphrase prompts for ssh keys appear in the terminal, not as a graphical prompt? <body> I'm SSHing into my mac and doing some stuff remotely through tmux (namely uploading some stuff to github). When I just tried to run a codegit push/code, my command kept stalling silently. I found ssh stalling on this message, codedebug1: key_parse_private_pem: PEM_read_PrivateKey failed/code, and divined that the password prompt was being caught by the Keychain app and being displayed on the screen. I was able to get it to go through by using teamviewer to enter my password on-screen.  But how do I keep these private key prompts from going to the screen in the future? I'm fine with being prompted for my passphrase, but I would like it to happen in a terminal window in the future.  <answer156941> the password for your key is managed by codessh-agent/code and it defaults to ask for your password using the GUI you mentioned. You could:  ol liUnlock your key using the shell frontend to codessh-agent/code by calling codessh-add/code. In this case you might want to lock your key with codessh-add -D/code before you log out of the box./li liCircumvent codessh-agent/code by temporarily unsetting the codeSSH_AUTH_SOCK/code variable codessh/code uses to connect to the agent. You can do this for a single command like this  precodeSSH_AUTH_SOCK="" git push /code/pre  or for the whole shell session by calling codeunset SSH_AUTH_SOCK/code./li /ol  Marcel
