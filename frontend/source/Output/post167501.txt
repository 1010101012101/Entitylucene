How to sort a table in Pages? <body> Few hours ago I am trying to sort a table! I don't know where is this think but is so annoying that I can't find with ease this thing.  I saw many articles saying that you have to go to Inspector, table tab and there is an option there, but this is the old version, I own the new one 5.5 and there is no such option.  Do you know guys where is this thing?  <answer167505> Click the down arrow on the column header and select Sort Ascending or Sort Decending.  <answer242224> ol liClick anywhere in the table so the row and column designations appear./li liPut your cursor on the letter of the column you'd like to sort by./li liRight-click, then select "Sort Ascending" or "Sort Descending"/li /ol  <answer257482> Apple is no help with this.
