I only have the Apple icon a spinning wheel. How can I reboot?  <answer145199> You can hold down the power button for 5 seconds to force a power down and then press it again to power it on. The power button, if you're looking at the front of the computer, is located on the back in the lower left hand corner.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/REafS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
