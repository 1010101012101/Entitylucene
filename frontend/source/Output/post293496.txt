Easiest way to repeat MANY mouse clicks? <body> h3Problem/h3  I imported a large OPML file to a Feedly (a RSS/source aggregator web service), and the import got messed up. I now need to delete the entries on their website using emGoogle Chrome/em, but there is no way to bulk delete.  Instead of manually clicking almost a thousand times, I'd like to quickly automate a Left-Mouse Click and loop it for as many times.  The reason I'm stating my specific use-case is because I am unlikely to ever use this particular automation again. I need a quick and dirty solution.  hr  h3Question/h3  What is indeed the fastest and easiest way to record and repeatedly perform a mouse-automation tasks, in macOS Sierra?  hr  h3Solutions/h3  I took a stab at macOS Automator's emWatch Me Do/em but really didn't get it to work with Chrome as it seems to interpret Left-Mouse clicks as em"Drag the scroll thumb in the scroll area"/em (??)sup1/sup.   I also investigated some third-party options like Keyboard Maestro and Murgaa (not endorsing any of these, nor have I tried them), as well as some scripting alternatives like CliClick but I must admit that learning how to script with these utilities feels a bit cumbersome right now.  I'm preferably looking for a reliable, and free, Mouse/Click Automator circa 2017 with a GUI. Is there something like that which is recommendable? Or should I tinker more with Automator or something else?  hr  subsup1/supI've added Automator to the macOS Accessibility settings./sub  <answer293503> Selenium isn't intended for this purpose, but likely could be scripted to solve your problem.  http://www.seleniumhq.org/  <answer293533> I know you already rejected CliClick, but what if the script was provided for you? It’s actually quite simple. In codeScript Editor/code enter the following:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     activate     repeat 500 times         do shell script "/Users/&lt;you&gt;/Desktop/cliclick c:" &amp; "1694,18"         delay 1.5     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Replace code1694,18/code with the actual coordinates of the button you want to click. Those can be obtained by pressing kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd4/kbd and hovering your cursor over the button.  Also replace code&lt;you&gt;/code with your account name, and adjust the codedelay/code as appropriate, to account for any animation or form postback.  Obviously this is all assuming the click occurs in the same spot each time. Your question doesn’t specify, although I get the sense that that is the case. Otherwise it would be very hard to script as a repeating click.  <comment370416> An answer very scalable to other situations : nice. got my vote. <comment370422> Thanks for providing the script! Given that, this was a very reasonable solution. Just for the record: I downloaded CliClick with Homebrew, and the path to be used is probably then: `/usr/local/bin/cliclick`. As your answer suggests, this only works if the button to be pressed is at the same location. Else it would be better to use Selenium according to CSS/XPath etc (as suggested by another answer). Lastly, I think it would be in the community to add answers for a completely GUI solution, but I'm accepting this answer.
