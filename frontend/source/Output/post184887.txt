How do I use task manager on a MAC using a PC Keyboard <body> Basically how do I 'control, alt, delete' But with a MAC computer, but using a Microsoft Keyboard? What other short cuts are there, like for instance, 'Alt F4' or 'Alt tab' but with a Microsoft keyboard.  <answer184890> On a Mac, the equivalent to Task Manager is the strongActivity Monitor/strong.  ol liFrom the strongDock/strong, click the strongLaunchpad/strong icon, then search for and click strongActivity Monitor/strong./li /ol  Alternatively, assuming that the Windows key behaves like the strong[Cmd]/strong key, you can use strong[Cmd+Space]/strong, then type strongActivity Monitor/strong.  However, for applications that need to be force closed, right-click that application in the strongDock/strong, press strong[Alt]/strong and choose strongForce Quit/strong.  <answer184891> The shortcuts are different for the OSs. You'll have to learn them, individually. Only third-party apps, and basic shortcuts like cut, copy, paste are similar. If you have a Win keyboard then the Win key is equal to Cmd (⌘) key, and rest are the same. Generally Win key is replaced with Cmd key in shortcuts.   The task manager is called Activity Monitor in Mac; find using Spotlight or in code/Applications/Utilities//code folder, but if you just wanna quit an app do Cmd + Alt + Esc (this can also be accessed through Apple () menu at the top).  I believe that Alt (⎇) + F4 quit an app on Win, so it's equivalent would be Cmd + Q. The Alt + Tab shortcut is the same as Cmd + Tab, or Cmd + Shft +Tab. Functions keys are rarely used and they have their pre-defined actions which you can see on a Mac keyboard. You can configure them to use as Standard functions key in the Keyboard Preference Pane.  You can see all the app shortcuts in the menus in the menu bar. The System shortcuts can be seem at System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts. You can also change them to what you like. If you find yourself using shortcuts but cannot remember them all I would recommend KeyCue, it shows all the possible shortcuts by pressing one.  <comment219315> Umm...

Mac doesn't have a Task Manager, as @user14492 explained, but knowing what you actually want to be able to do would really help us answer your question. You can edit your post with the button right underneath to explain further. <comment219320> I'd prefer we knew what the OP actually needs, before we throw a lot of alternatives at him. At the moment, it's something of an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info)
