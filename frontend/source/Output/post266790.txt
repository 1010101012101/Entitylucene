Reinstallation of Barclays Mobile Banking keeps previous installation's data, even after I completely remove app from iPhone <body> I am trying to uninstall an application (Barclays application) I have installed using Apple Store and reinstall it again.  The problem is that even if I uninstall (by tapping on it and click 'X')it and redownload it from Apple Store, the app still keeps my user data and I don't want that. This happens for the first time, only with this application.  How can I specify in the apple store to forget I have ever installed this app? Can I remove this from my cloud or remove any cookies or cache memory or anything else?   I am using iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 if that's any help.  <answer266798> In the Barclays app, go to Settings â†’ Cancel my registration and follow the instructions.  <answer266814> The problem is solved somehow.  I am not sure if the process I have followed really helped, but this is what I did:  ol liRestart iPhone/li liDelete application/li liReinstall applicationbr/li liGo to Settings-iCloud-Storage-Manage Storage-iPhone Latest Backup-Show all apps-Find Barclays record-disable-remove its databr/li liRemove applicationbr/li liRestart /li liReinstall and open application/li /ol  <comment334576> I have talked on the phone with them and they have told me that they removed my account. So normally, when I open the new installed app, I should not be asked for my 5-digit pin that I have set before. And right now this is what the app asks me. So even if they removed me from the system, the app still thinks that I have an account. <comment334869> What exactly are you considering to be "user data" in this case? <comment334907> @Andreas After I open the app it showed the text I had set in my first installation to help me remember my 5-digit pin. The problem now is solved though.
