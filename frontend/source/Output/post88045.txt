Is there a dock for switching between windows? <body> Is there a feature or an add-on for OS X that lists the current app's open windows for quick visual switching?   The way I envision it is in the form of a second dock, say on the right-hand or left-hand corner of the screen.  A similar question was asked here, but the HyperDock answer doesn't work for me. I am looking for a visual list that is available always, not just on hover.  Another question points out Fantastisk. This looks perfect, but the product has been discontinued and it seems unclear whether it even supports 10.8.     Edit: Witch seems to come close, I'll try it out. I would emstill/em prefer a permanently visible list.   <answer88060> You can use ⌘` to switch between windows in the current application and ⌃F4 to switch between windows on the current space. And you can use an application like Alfred to assign shortcuts to applications.  Witch is one of the most popular window-based Dock / command-tab alternatives.

F3 shows a stacked view of multiple windows of an app - definitely not what I need.  Can this be configured? (I'll take a look in the settings.) I sometimes have 10 browser windows with 3 tabs each for repetitive tasks, and I need the ability to directly jump to one of them using the mouse.
