How do I export BBedit Settings to another mac <body> I currently have bbedit setup with my custom shortcuts and I would like to export these setting to my office mac. Is there a way for me to export these settings ?  <answer227485> To export your settings and preferences to a new Mac copy the following files and folders to it:  file:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.barebones.bbedit.plist /code/pre  folders:  precode~/Library/BBEdit ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit /code/pre  code~/code indicates your user folder.  <comment367102> This answer didn't work for me; possibly because I am using a different version of BBEdit. The additional task I had to do is update the file name for `~//Library/BBEdit/Sleep State-some_id.appstate` (where "some_id" appears to be unique to a machine).  I did this by first running BBEdit on the target machine to determine the new "some_id" then I performed the tasks in this answer from @klanomath.  After that I renamed `~//Library/BBEdit/Sleep State-some_id.appstate` to `~//Library/BBEdit/Sleep State-new_some_id.appstate`. <comment367103> These tasks should also be performed w/o BBEdit running.
