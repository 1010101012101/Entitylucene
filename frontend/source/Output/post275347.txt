Text in place of Finder icons (MacOS Sierra) <body> My finder looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nMP6q.png" alt="Finder"  If I click on the text 'view', 'action' etc, it shows all the options and I'm able to use it quite normally. What gives?  How do I get the icons + buttons back?  <answer275350> Getting the buttons back is actually really simple:  First, select strongView  Customize Toolbar.../strong in the menu bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPyUA.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, just make sure the dropdown (the one outlined in red) has the option you want selected. The default is Icon Only.   <comment346375> Is your issue the fact that there is text instead of icons? It isn't too clear what you're asking hereâ€¦ <comment346376> @Jackson1442 I guess I forgot to ask the main question! Have updated it, thanks for pointing it out.
