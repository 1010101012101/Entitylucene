AppleScript to 'Bring All Hidden and Minimized Apps to Front'? <body> Have been searching for an hour. I am halfway through, but not getting very far.  Does anyone know what code to use to 'Bring All Hidden and Minimized Apps to Front'?  Regards.  <answer247945> Only one window can be emfrontmost/em, at a time, however the following AppleScript emcode/em will unhide and un-minimize all windows.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Events"     set the visible of every process to true     do shell script "killall -HUP Dock" end tell /code/pre  <comment305966> Awesome. Just to make sure, killing all the dock isn't an issue at all for any application (bugs, problems, etc; not that it doesn't work)? <comment305967> No, it shouldn't.  I've used `killall -HUP Dock` for 10 years and never had issues with any application because of doing so. <comment305969> Cool. Thanks for the help.
