What is SIMBL Agent and why is it running on my machine? <body> Is this something loaded by Apple or did it come with some third party app I must have downloaded.  <answer3920> SIMBL is not a part of Apple's Mac OS X package, but is an extension that can be used by other developers in their own work to extend applications where they may not have the original source code (like Safari). SIMBL-related files can be found either in code/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/code or code~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/code.  <answer9760> It is usually used by SafariFlvSniffer.bundle which comes with a video downloader app.  <comment3731> For a more “technical” response, see the simbl page directly: http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php <comment10222> It's used by a whole lot more than just that. <comment10279> One SIMBL Extension i have installed is "[The Unarchiever](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html)" which replaces the Finder File-Compression/decompression-Function and supports more Formats. <comment10280> The Unarchiver is not a SIMBL plugin. <comment96702> For 10.7 & 10.8 see: https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL/ <comment196462> It is used by tons of other plugins. LastPass is the plugin I currently use that uses it. Definitely just check /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins on your machine to see what is using it for you.
