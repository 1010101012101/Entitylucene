How to fix Mail stuck importing messages from a Time Machine backup? <body> I'm setting up a new Mac from an old one, and everything's working perfect, except for getting Mail set up.  This is what I'm seeing with Mail:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oml9U.png" alt="enter image description here"  The "Time remaining" figure just keeps increasing, while the "Imported X of Y messages" number gets stuck on 14.  I've tried searching Apple's support community, but none of the suggestions there have helped. Any ideas on how to fix this?  <answer249177> If it is IMAP or Exchange you can skip this process and just add your account afterwards.  I would not advise to skip it if it was a POP3 account because usually it means you only have a local copy of those mailboxes and won't get synced when adding the account again.
