If yes, then you can go back on the iPhone 4. If not, then you are stuck on the latest version. <comment113208> supposedly there are iOS 6.1.3 untethered jailbreaks [available now](http://google.com/search?q=ios+6.1.3+untethered+jailbreak), although I haven't tried them, as I'm quite happy with 5.1. <comment113294> There is no untethered 6.1.3 Jailbreak out right now (unless you're on an old bootrom 3GS).
