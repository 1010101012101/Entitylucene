Any workflow to locally go from an mail.app message or mbox to Markdown? <body> Any workflow to locally go from an mail.app message or mbox to Markdown? (locally meaning on the local machine and not through any webservice.)  The use case is to save an existing message or set of messages (i.e. a mailbox) in markdown format with a folder of associated assets like images, attachments.  Mail.app allows one to save an email in RTFD (which includes images but not attachments.) or raw subject.eml format. A mail box can be exported to a mailbox_name.mbox.  One can even bulk export to code.eml/code files  Ideally, such a workflow would end up with a subject.md file with related assets in a subject_files directory.  An automation is helpful, but not essential.   So far, I've not found a clear workflow path for getting from the standard .eml, .rtdf and .mbox to markdown plus related files.
