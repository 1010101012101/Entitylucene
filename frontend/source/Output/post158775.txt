News channels on ITunes Radio? <body> On iTunes radio I have been unable to find any new news channels with the exception of public radio in every city.  Are there any other news stations on iTunes Radio?  <answer158777> In iTunes you should have two options for listing to radio stations.  1) Internet stations (available in all Countries) - see the "Internet" tap under Music, where you should be able to find live stations with or without news.  2) Radio (not available in all Countries) - see the "Radio" tab under Music, this will only offer music streaming from a standard radio setup (possible to setup with your own music taste).  <answer193768> In iTunes Radio or now Apple Music you can search for your local NPR station by call sign (not all are available). Or check out the main NPR station:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/station/npr-news-and-culture/idra.840950253
