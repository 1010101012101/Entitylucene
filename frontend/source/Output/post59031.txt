How to recover Mountain Lion's dmg file after installation? <body> I downloaded Mountain Lion from App Store and installed it.  I have not set Time Machine and I installed Mountain Lion one hour ago (since posting this question).  The dmg file is not in Applications folder anymore.  How to recover Mountain Lion's dmg file after installation?  <answer59036> After Mountain Lion is installed, your Mac auto-deletes "Installer Mountain Lion.app". So before installs or upgrades like that, you must make a backup (compress it and move file compressed to anywhere, where you put storage data).  And now, you need to download "Installer Mountain Lion.app" again from the App Store.  <answer59081> If you open the app store, you'll see the purchase button next to Mountain Lion now says "Download", or you can find it in the purchases section. You have to re-download it but at least you don't have to pay for it again ;-)  <answer86359> Yere if you download the app its invisably stored into your MacBook  <comment68023> No way to recover deleted file? <comment68027> As long as time machine is not configurated to backup aplication foler, no, it is not possible. <comment68032> even via recovery apps? <comment68082> You could theoretically use a data recovery application to get it back, but quite a bit easier to just redownload from the app store. <comment99825> can you explain where on the MacBook the original download is stored? <comment124771> where exactly is the file located when downloaded from Mac app store? <comment188866> @carbonr: default alway is /Applications folder <comment188867> I'm in Yosemite now! Lions are dead. Thanks though <comment188868> And for me, I'm came back 10.9 Marverick (on my old macbook 2010, 10.10 very slow although running SSD)
