Multithreaded Video Converter on Mac? <body> Is there an app for Mac that can distribute a single video encoding job to several thread to utilize the full potential of the system?  I used an application called iFlicks to do video encoding, and as far as I know, it's single-threaded, so even though it can use all my CPU time, it cannot squeeze the best performance out of my system.  I am using a 15" MacBook Pro with Retina Display.  Also, I knew that there were multithreaded ffmpeg implementation, but I can't figure out how to use that. If anyone could help, it's much appreciated.  <answer80465> Compressor by Apple not only one of the most fully featured encoders around and fully supports multiple threads, it even supports distributed encoding so that more than one Mac can work on a single job.  <answer88284> You can benefit from using AppGeeker MOV MP4 Converter for Mac, it is a nice little multithreaded media conversion tool that can convert almost every video format on Mac.  <answer88295> Handbreak converts videos to  H.264(x264), MPEG-4 and MPEG-2 (libav) and uses multiple cores.  <comment92863> Compressor is multithreaded? Really, never noticed that. <comment92864> Yup - "With Apple Qmaster features now built into Compressor, you can quickly use available cores in your Mac — as well as other Mac computers on your network — to speed up encoding jobs." You can send that video workhorse to me anytime you need it tuned up - encodes are the only time I see my Air really break a sweat these days :_) <comment103658> thanks for answering, but after testing multiple solutions, Compressor is much faster and can distribute jobs to multiple Macs, which works great. But it's a paid solution, and it's better to keep this answer here so anyone looking for a free solution can find this.
