/StartupItem/ Error, How to resolved the issue? <body> I'm using Macbook Pro late 2011 and I'm getting this error in my startup.  I've already performed strongRepair Disk Permission/strong in my strongUtilities/strong;  I've also upgraded from Lion to Mountain Lion (em10.8.3/em) but non of the solutions repaired it. I don't want to install fresh Mountain Lion and re-install again, it would be a tedious solution. Any idea how can this be resolved?

Then you can reinstall or delete the problem applications.  While in Safe mode look in to the Console for more information on start up problems.
