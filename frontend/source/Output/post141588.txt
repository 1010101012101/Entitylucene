iTerm2 where is [ ] keybindings? <body> Is there a reason why kbdALT/kbd+kbd8/kbd / kbdALT/kbd+kbd9/kbd does not produce code[/code and code]/code in iTerm2 ?  I'm running with defaults and a code.bashrc/code/code.bash_profile/code that produces the correct result in Terminal.app.   <answer141595> iTerm2's defaults for the Option keys are called “Esc+”, which basically means it will type an escape character (code\033/code) before any character you type while holding down Option. To get the same behavior you see in Terminal, go to Preferences  Profiles  (your profile)  Keys and select Meta under both "right option key" and "left option key".  <comment166851> What keyboard layout are you using? In the US and Canadian layouts there are dedicated keys for [ and ] -- Alt-8 is • and Alt-9 is ª as per the layouts. Are you using a different layout?
