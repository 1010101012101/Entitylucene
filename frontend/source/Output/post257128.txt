Getting "Can't open display" errors, did not get before <body> At work, I have to rsh into a Solaris machine daily from my Mac (ssh is not available).  And have to use many X11 things (xterm, nedit, etc.)  On the Mac side, I have been doing:  precode$ xhost + X.X.X.X (Solaris IP) $ rsh username@X.X.X.X /code/pre  Then, once logged into Solaris, I set my DISPLAY:  precode$ export DISPLAY=Y.Y.Y.Y:0.0 (My Mac IP) /code/pre  All the X stuff was working just fine for the past couple of years, now suddenly, I'm getting those dreaded "Can't open display" errors.  precode$ xterm xterm Xt error: Can't open display: Y.Y.Y.Y:0.0  $ nedit NEdit: Can't open display /code/pre  I have been researching, trying different things, but hitting dead ends. A colleague of mine suggested that a recent update of XProtect Config Data, may have caused this problem.  I've looked at Xprotect.plist and Xprotect.meta.plist, but not sure what to look for... if that's even the problem.  I know they protect from malware and other bad things.  My specs:br OS X 10.11.3br XQuartz 2.7.9  Since this is a work-related issue, I'm kinda dead in the water unless I can figure this out!  Life was great up to a few days ago...   Thanks in advance for any help!
