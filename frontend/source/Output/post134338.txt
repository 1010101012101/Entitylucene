Why does the icon of a PC show a blue screen? <body> So in Finder, Mac finds a Windows PC in the Network. When I right click on it and click Get Info, I see an icon that shows a computer monitor with a blue screen. By blue screen I mean a crashed PC. Why is this? Why not a normal desktop image?   <answer134342> Because it was Apple's way of making fun of Windows. No reason other than that.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zv6jf.png" width="300"  <comment158994> "0942v8653" is right. You can also notice that the PC looks like an old one from the 2000s. More generally, Apple love to put some jokes/references in its icons and source codes. <comment159008> Kind of childish, isn't it? <comment159057> @MaxRied Not childish, just a light-hearted dig at a competitor that seems to have been in the OS since about 2007. Most people won't even notice it and I expect it'll raise a smile from those that do. It's probably a little out-dated now though. <comment159064> Now all Apple has to do to make fun of Windows is show a Windows 8 desktop <comment159069> As an icon, it needs to be recognizable both at small and large sizes. I think a simple image like this works better than "a normal desktop image," with its tiny icons, etc. Also, I would guess that, even for regular users, that blue screen is recognizable as something only a Windows PC will do.
