How can I rename the columns in Numbers? <body> I'm working with a language file, with columns for different languages. My first row is the language names.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NCUIH.png" alt="languages"  Is it possible to have the "A", "B", "C", etc as language names instead. That way, when I scroll I can still identify each column.  <answer52030> I would think it would be better to emfreeze/em the first row and by so, it will be visible all over the document when you scroll. But unfortunately, this function sisn't/s wasn't available in Numbers.  You might try editing the document in strongPrint View/strong. The columns and rows are repeated as you scroll, which allows you to see what column/row you are on. Numbers does allow editing in print view. It's not exactly what you are looking for, but it's a solution.  strongEdit:/strong And as you've answered your own question, it looks like this function is available at this moment.  <answer52049> As often happens, a couple of minutes after posting the question, I found a way to do this.   In the strongInspector/strong, (opt-cmd-i), in the strongTable Inspector/strong tab click on the middle button of strongHeaders and Footers/strong. Select the option strongFreeze Header Rows/strong and the first row will stick to the top.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuXU6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment59502> I sure wish numbers had this, I can't believe it doesn't. I've been looking for it for a while now and gave up. Freezing or locking a row or column is incredible important and should be in every spreadsheet program. It's in the program Tables for what it's worth. <comment59505> @Michiel Thanks for the answer. I actually found the option to freeze header rows a couple of minutes after I posted the question. The option to freeze header rows is a little hidden away. It's in the Inspector. <comment59507> Nice solution! Which software do you use to take screenshots like that btw? <comment59508> Cool, didn't knew that :-) Great! <comment59509> Thanks! I used the wonderful Skitch http://www.skitch.com/ <comment59527> Fantastic. Made my day (I'm traveling so it's easy to do). <comment59562> @Richard good to hear!
