Setting path env variable in Yosemite 10.10.2 for a GUI app <body> After upgrading to 10.10.2 when I lunch a GUI app from a terminal using codeopen -a app/code the app doesn't see the path currently set from that terminal session. Before the upgrade that was working. Any idea what happened?  <comment201726> Have You tried this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152294/shell-environment-variables-not-available-in-gui-apps-even-if-app-launched-via-c?rq=1 ? <comment201727> As he stated in a deleted comment in that thread : Apparently it does not work anymore in 10.10.2 <comment201728> No idea why my comment is deleted ... I've tried it, it doesn't work. <comment201809> This is a known bug in 10.10. launchctl setenv can't set the $PATH. /etc/launchd.conf is deprecated and no longer works either. What app are you trying to set the $PATH for? I can try a few things later when I'm back at my Mac. <comment201844> WebStorm/IntelliJ, I have a workaround for this to get Grunt working and some commands in embedded Terminal, but it used to be much easer to pick up everything from Terminal ... <comment203867> The answer to "what happened" is that this appears to be an OS X bug, but is your question how to fix this problem? <comment203868> Is a solution that affects all GUI apps acceptable?
