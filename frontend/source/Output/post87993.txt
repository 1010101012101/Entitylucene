How to type backslash in Russian on Macbook pro <body> I can't find the backslash key either in low case or upper case(by holding shift key) in Russian input method( I chose it on input source) on Macbook pro.  But if I choose russian pc input method, there is no "e with two dots above",  but in the place having slash and backslash.  Any one has the same problem?  Thanks,   <answer87996> Try Russian Phonetic, option/alt + shift on the rightmost key on the bottom row.  I think to have the ё on Russia PC, you need to have an ISO keyboard (one with an extra key between the z and shift).  Some time ago I made a Russian PC layout where that character is more accessible.  If you want to try it (not sure it still works), go to  https://dl.dropbox.com/u/46870715/k/RussianPC2.keylayout  <comment102971> You mean like this /  фтв \ щк ї щк ЎЌ щк  Ë <comment102973> Thanks. How do I install RussianPC2.keylayout on Mac? <comment102976> Put the .keylayout file in Library/Keyboard Layouts or Home/Library/Keyboard Layouts, logout/login, check the box in system prefs/language & Text/Input Sources, select in the "flag" menu at top right of the screen. <comment102977> @Buscar Which keyboard layout are you using and which keys?  Without that info your comment doesn't help someone else type the same thing. <comment102982> Rusian PC keyboard !? <comment103008> @Buscar And are you also able to tell us which key you used to make the ё, as was requested? <comment103009> ыщккяб цфы игыыя шт фтщерук здфсуб Ш гуыв еру КгышфтЗС фтв фкд sorry I was busy in another place, I used Russian PC and ctrl for the backslash and the ё is is in top left under esc. <comment103016> as Requested ????? <comment103020> @Buscar Thanks for the info.  Unfortunately the ё is only on that key when you have a European hardware keyboard.  On a US keyboard that key makes ] and the ё is missing. <comment103023> It works and it's exactly the same as "QStamina", which is a typing russian exercise program. Thanks!
