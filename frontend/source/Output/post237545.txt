How do we extend trackpad touch area all the way to the edge in OS X? <body> For example, when touching on the very edges of the trackpad, OS X ignores gestures. In Linux, I can use the full trackpad.  How do I use the full trackpad in OS X? How do I tell OS X not to ignore the edges of the trackpad?  EDIT: oops, looks like I posted a duplicate: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/233928/how-to-enable-touch-on-the-bottom-edge-of-the-trackpad, but no responses there yet. :(  <answer237575> Sadly, you can't. This is just a system software thing, and unfortunately, you can't go in and modify system software. There's no setting for it and I don't imagine there's a third-party app for this.  <comment290983> You can't.
