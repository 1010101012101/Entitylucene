Is there any way to tell if someone is reading my iMessages? <body> I think someone may be reading my iMessages on another device?  Is this possible?  Is there any way to find out?  <answer88080> This is possible if somebody knows your AppleID password and uses it to log in onto another device. Changing the password and reviewing the list of alternative phone numbers/email addresses associated with your AppleID should be enough to resolve that (assuming that your new password is significantly better than the old).  <comment103060> Why do you think so? <comment103110> Not sure there's a way to know about this, but if you have a doubt, you'd better change your account password.
