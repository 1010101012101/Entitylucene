Censor bleep keyboard shortcut <body> I want the censor beep that you hear on TV to play continuously as a system sound when I hold down F12 on my MacBook.  I make screen recordings for YouTube videos. Because I have brothers and sisters that use profanity and I want to keep those moments out of my videos without further editing after I record them.   Is there a way to do this (assuming I am able to press the key fast enough of course)?  <comment140785> Are you recording your screen and need the key to play the noise internally or is this just you looking to turn your Mac external speaker into a soundboard just like if you had a horn or buzzer on your desk and the video recorder is an iPhone or other camera? <comment140825> @bmike Need to play it as a system sound, so it will be part of my videos. I need it to play constantly when I hold down F12 and stop when I let go.
