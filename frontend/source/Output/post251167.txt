How to set up another device so that it won't need to set up wireless to hot spot every time? <body> How can we set up a device to connect to my iPhone hot spot automatically?  The details is: I have an iPhone 6 Plus with iOS 9.3.4 (9.3.5 won't install for some reason), and an iPhone 5S and iPhone 5 with iOS 9.3.5.  The iPhone 6 Plus can have the hot spot set to On in Settings, so that the other iPhones can use this iPhone 6 Plus as a hot spot to go onto the Internet. (the other 2 iPhones have a sim card but do not have any voice or data plan subscription).  But if the 2 iPhones are placed on the side for 20 minutes or so, when I use the phone again, then the Internet is lost. I have to go to Settings, Wireless, and choose my hot spot again, without typing in any password. (I only had to type in the password for the very first time, but not afterwards).  Isn't there a way to have the two smaller iPhones connect back to the hot spot automatically?  I can do it manually, and no password is needed to be typed in any way, so it seems that the iphone should be able to do it by itself.  Interestingly, the older iPhone, the iPhone 5, will sometimes automatically connect back to the hot spot, but sometimes you still have to do it manually.  I have tried turning on / off Bluetooth, and setting the automatic renew (of lease) in the Settings, but it was no use.
