Global convert to uppercase and lowercase in macOS X Sierra? <body> In Mail.app and Text.app there's Edit  Transformations::  ul liMake Upper Case/li liMake Lower Case/li liCapitalize/li /ul  ...but I see no keyboard shortcut options inbr System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts:: Services.  Is there a way to get this functionality available globally for all text entry? For example, web based forums like Stack Exchange.  Of note, the options are available in Safari.app's Edit  Transformations menu img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/52Jh3.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...but not in Chrome.app. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dIGsK.png" alt="enter image description here"  I could change my browser habits, but it would be nice to know if there is a way to add this functionality to all "Edit" menus.  <answer268218> You can do it in Safari, but Chrome ignores the standard Mac Toolbox, unfortunately.    System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts  You can set key commands for All Applications, which will then work for all that have the requisite menu option.  This is my own setup, which shows keys already set for Capitalise &amp; Lower Casebr I use it a lot for such as Stack Exchange.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqlsm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment336701> sweet! I guess the follow up is how to override an app ignoring the standard macOS toolbox? <comment336705> Don't think it can be done. There's no handle to grab, functionality just isn't in the app at all. You'd have to juggle with something that could lift it to the clipboard, edit & put it back. It's the kind of thing that maybe QuicKeys could do, but idk if it still works in recent OS X, I haven't used it since it stopped active development, several years ago.
