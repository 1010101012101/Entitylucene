Is there a shortcut or way to use code, to do anything at all with the item currently highlighted by Command+F? <body> Title pretty much says it all. Also if anyone knows how to drag and drop something into a browser using any language or command(s), please share.  To be clear i'm talking about something like this:  ol liPress command+f/li liType in "the"/li li(Insert magic hotkey, or bit of code, here, that does anything at with the word currently highlighted by command+f)/li /ol  This could be used to click a link, for instance, or highlight the first word in a sentence (if you could use the command to do 2 clicks in quick succession) (at which point you could use shift+arrow keys to highlight the rest of the sentence, or the other commands to highlight by more than one character at a time, like shift+command+arrow keys)  As far as i know no such shortcut exists, but i don't see why, (so maybe one does exist and i'm just not aware of it).  <answer220442> If you strongselect text in Safari/strong (your example) emAccessibility Inspector/em will list among Attributes:      ul li"Passive" text . . AXRole: strongAXStaticText/strong &nbsp; / &nbsp; AXValue: [text of a whole paragraph]/li liLink . . . . . . . . . . AXRole: strongAXStaticText/strong &nbsp; / &nbsp; AXValue: [link name]/li /ul  There's not very much functionality to detect there, is it?br Selected text in TextEdit on the other hand will display:  ul li[Any text] . AXRole: strongAXTextArea/strong &nbsp; / &nbsp; AXValue: [Whole text] &nbsp; / &nbsp; strongAXSelectedTextRange/strong: [value]/li li[Link] . . . . AXRole: strongAXLink/strong &nbsp; / &nbsp; AXRoleDescription: strongHyperlink/strong &nbsp; / &nbsp; AXURL: [strongits URL: http://.../strong]/li /ul  In Safari not too much can be done with highlighted text. Other programs -TextEdit!- that support accessibility more naturally, emCAN/em be manipulated to a higher degree.     If you look at the hierarchy of a quite common button ("edited" on this page) it will reveal itself as:     emAXStaticText ["edited"] / AXLink / AXGroup / AXWebArea / AXScrollArea / AXGroup / AXGroup / AXTabGroup / AXSplitGroup / AXWindow:AXStandardWindow / AXApplication/em     Doesn't sound very inviting to me, searching for a simple button ...br If I had to do a search I'd rather look into a Safari-document's source, text or URL, all of which are accessible, see: Safari's sdef file.  <comment264836> You will need several shortcuts that are already implemented. For example copying you can do with CMD+C and clicking with your mouse or trackpad. <comment264906> You cannot do command f then directly begin to highlight or click on a word (and thats what im asking about). I know about clicking with a physical mouse, i'm wondering if theres a shortcut to click the item current highlighted by command+f. Clearly theres none, or none that are widely known anyways. <comment264910> Ok, this explains your question more to me. Perhaps you could edit your question to avoid downvotes. <comment264928> I said a shortcut or some code to click the item currently highlighted by command f. I also said i'm looking for a shortcut/piece of code, that would **enable me to click** (Which I'd think rules out the possibility of "click it" being a valid answer). How should i phrase the question? I don't know how to say it any better better. <comment264935> i think the problem is more with the question itself than its phrasing. Its hard to elegantly phrase that question without using like 3 sentences to prevent people from misinterpreting it. I probably shouldv'e left it as simply "Is there a shortcut or way to use code, to do anything with the item currently highlighted by Command+F?" <comment264945> I think your question is much clearer now.
