Set default "From" address to none in Apple Mail <body> In Apple Mail, is there a way to make the "From" address blank so that you are forced to select and outgoing mail server each time you create a new message. I keep sending from the wrong address!!  <answer124687> I do not know how make and use "none" in the from field that will remind you to select the correct sending server but:  You can set up the default sending server that is going to be the default from now on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NmDJl.png" alt="enter image description here"     Send new message from   , change to the server of your choice.  Remember all emails from now on will go out from that server, regardless in which server you received them.  <comment145867> Well, if you want to use the right send from server, there is way to do that, BUT it is not variable, it will be always the same server. <comment145868> Ya, that doesn't really solve my problem thought because when I create new messages it auto selects the last mail server I used. <comment145869> You are right, it selects the current server you are in (the message is in), but if you want to use another server automagicaly it is possible :) <comment145875> This changed the default server the OP wants to be forced to choose one when sending - so he does not want at all to "Remember all emails from now on will go out from that server," He knows that setting the server name here does that <comment145876> That works for me... Thanks @Buscar <comment145877> You are welcome, I faced same forgetting it problem as well till it was to late when I saw I used the wrong server :(
