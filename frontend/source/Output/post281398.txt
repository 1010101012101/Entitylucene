How do I see a log of WiFi connect/disconnect events? <body> I'm having trouble with my router, where the WiFi keeps disconnecting on most of our home devices, so I'm testing different settings on the router. (Seems to be affected by security protocol...)  I would like to see a log – on my MacBook Pro (10.11.5) – of WiFi connect/disconnect events so I can keep track.  What's the easiest way to do this? Can I use some kind of filter in Console, or is there a CLI command?  I tried filtering "link down on en0" in console in "All Messsages", but I have to click "Earlier" many times; I'd like to see all events from the past few days at once. And I'd also like to see which WiFi SSID was in use at the time of disconnect, which Console doesn't show me.

If not, can you clarify? Also, what version of macOS are you running? <comment354059> Yes, sorry, I'll edit
