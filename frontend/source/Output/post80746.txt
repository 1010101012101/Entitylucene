Improved Terminal autocomplete funcionality (similar to Matlab's) <body> If any of you ever used Matlab, you might have noticed the command window functionality in that program. I wonder if it is possible to enable the same functionality in Mac Terminal.  It works like this: suppose you have used two commands previously in this Terminal session. First you used a codecd ~/code and then a codels -la/code.  In every *nix terminal, including Mac's, if you hit the codeUp Arrow/code, it'll first show the codels -la/code command and, if you hit it twice, the codecd ~/code command. This is great. But, in Matlab, if you first type the letter codec/code and then hit codeUp Arrow/code, it won't show you codels/code, but instead go directly to codecd ~/code. This saves a lot of time when you have big commands and a long list of previously used commands.  Is it possible?  <answer80748> In a Bash shell, you can hit kbdControl/kbd+kbdR/kbd to do a reverse intelligent search in the history. Start typing the command and the shell will autocomplete with previously entered commands.  Then you can either press kbdEnter/kbd to execute the command again, use the arrow left or right key to edit the command, or keep pressing kbdControl/kbd+kbdR/kbd to cycle through other possible completions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f8Rmm.png" alt="Reverse intelligent search"  <answer80750> This is a feature of the shell. Control-R will do what you describe, but changing to a more modern shell will get you so much more. Take a look at Z-shell (zsh), there is a bit of a learning curve, but it is very powerful.  <answer80755> Another thing you can do is type code!/code and then the first letter, and it will find the most recent. IE: codecd ~/code can be accessed with code!c/code  <answer80766> Add these to your .cshrc (if you are using tcsh) --  precode  bindkey -k up history-search-backward   bindkey -k down history-search-forward /code/pre  Then do source ~/.cshrc to get exactly the functionality you describe.  I don't know if there is a .profile equivalent.  <answer80801> Save this as ~/.inputrc:  precode# make the up and down arrows cycle through commands that match the start of a line "\e[A": history-search-backward "\e[B": history-search-forward /code/pre  Option-up would be code\e\e[A/code and control-p code\C-p/code. You can see the escape sequences of other key combinations by pressing control-v.  <answer80847> zsh will complete commands exactly like in your example. You don't even have to do anything other than use it for your shell.  <comment93228> I think you mean Control-R. <comment93254> Yes I did. Thanks. <comment304670> For users who don't yet have `~/.inputrc`, just create one.
