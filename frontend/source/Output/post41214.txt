Create Lion DVD from Lion USB flash drive <body> Is it possible to convert a lion Dvd from a Lion flash drive? Last year when Lion came out I created a lion install usb. I need to create a dvd to send to someone off site and did not want to give my trusty usb drive away. Is it possible to burn this to disc? I did a little googling there doesnt seem to be an easy way other than redownloading from Apple.   <answer41215> You should be able to accomplish this by doing the following:  ul liOpen strongDisk Utility/strong/li liPlug in your Lion Installer USB flash drive, wait for the volume to mount/li liInsert a strongblank DVD/strong/li liClick on the Lion Installer volume/li liClick the strongBurn/strong button: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFYBF.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  This emshould/em burn the volume to the DVD.
