Display a webpage in Mac lock screen <body> I want to leave my Mac locked, but display a web page (representing a web-based dashboard) in the lock screen. The idea is to leave this web dashboard showing 24x7 but without letting anyone else get access to the rest of the system.  <answer166719> ol liYou can download this screensaver which allows you to specify the site you want to display (found there)./li liTurn on the password to make your screensaver to be the lock screen:  ol liOpen "System Preferences"/li liGo to "Security &amp; Privacy"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iatFS.png" alt=""  ol start="3" liCheck "Require password [immediatly] after sleep or screensaver begins"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7LxQE.png" alt=""/li /ol/li /ol  <answer187815> You may be interested in a product my team and I are about to release, called Screensaver Ninja. True to its name, the ninja transforms your screensaver into a rotation of live websites like dashboards, analytics, news, the weather...whatever you need.   Apart from being able to lock your computer as detailed above, you can also choose to lock the screensaver so that whilst everyone can view the data, you must have a keycode to access it.   <comment195419> as a screen shot of the web page ? <comment196611> Excellent. I wish there was a way to zoom the web page, but then I can workaround it by writing a proxy web site. <comment196612> @Buscarì›ƒ - no; as I want the dynamic webpage rendered with JS behaviours intact. nicael's answer below does exactly that. <comment222170> Thanks for self-disclosing your affiliation.
