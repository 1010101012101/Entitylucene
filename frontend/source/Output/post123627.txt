Looking for a word processor with the power of Markdown <body> Basically, I am looking for a word editor (like Word or Pages) that is compatible with Markdown. I want to be able to write in Markdown but with the concept of pages. Their are a lot of Markdown editor but none that handles the concept of pages (I know that Markdown is primary for the web, so I understand why), but I will use Markdown for document that I will need to print, so I need to know, in advance, the number of pages.  Here is what I need:  ol licompatible with Markdown/li liheader : same for every page/li lifooter : same for every page/li linumber of pages and page numbers/li liautomatically numbering headings (you can do it with CSS)/li lieditable stylesheet/li lilive preview/li lieasy to use/li /ol  Mou can do must of this (items 1, 5, 6, 7, 8). The problems are for header, footer and number of pages and page numbers  Do you know a software that can do what I need ?  <answer255027> Texts is a strange hybrid between a text editor and what you are looking for.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsjG9.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liMarkdown visual editor/li /ul     Write using Markdown - without having to remember the markup. With   Texts you can apply styles to words or paragraphs and immediately see   the results. Your images and tables are displayed directly within   Texts.   ul liWell-structured content/li /ul     Use Texts to create structured documents. You set your titles and   headings, and they will stay in place if you export your document to   another format.   ul liBlogging on GitHub Pages/li /ul     Content written in Texts can be easily published as a blog on GitHub   Pages, with math, tables, footnotes etc.   ul liPerfect for academics/li /ul     Developed to cover all your needs: formulas and footnotes,   bibliography and citations, tables and links.   ul liSingle source publishing/li /ul     Writing your documents in Texts gives you a lot of flexibility. You   can easily convert your words into clean HTML5, professional PDFs,   ePub or Word format, or even a presentation.   ul liProfessional typesetting/li /ul     Texts produces immaculate PDFs. Everything you create — from   paragraphs of text to mathematical formulae — is perfectly typeset.   See some sample documents.   ul liCross-platform application/li /ul     Mac OS X or Windows? Doesn't matter, use Texts on both. The app has   native look and feel on each platform, and the document format is   common across platforms.   ul liCustom themes/li /ul     Change the appearance of your text editor with themes.   ul liExport templates/li /ul     Adjust style of any published documents with export templates.   http://www.texts.io/  <comment144632> It's not so much that Markdown is for the web, it's that it is for plain text and text editors. You won't find many word processors that allow markdown because it's unnecessary. They can already do what markdown adds to text. <comment146398> I recommend you to learn LaTeX. Of course, the syntax is different from markdown. But after trying a lot of editors (MSWord, Pages, OpenOffice/LibreOffice), I can tell it is the best one and you can do all you want (from items 2 to 8, 7 is done by opening generated document in Preview). Spend 2 or 3 days learning it, and you'll see. <comment317590> Welcome to Ask Different.
