How to display a folder knowing its path? <body> How can I display a folder in a different Finder window knowing its path ?  <answer215827> In the "Go" Menu in Finder there is a "Go to Folder..." menu item.  Alternatively you can use the shortcut: kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbdG/kbd  You can   ol liOpen a new Finder window/li liUse either of those commands/li liType the path in the dialog that appears/li /ol  <comment260727> Where from? From Finder, from Terminal? It's not ideal to just copy the question title in description, provide more information. <comment260734> Didn't you mean [⇧]+[⌘]+[G]? <comment260735> th shortcut is command+Shift+G for me..anyway, thank you for the answer ;) <comment260922> heh... yep...
