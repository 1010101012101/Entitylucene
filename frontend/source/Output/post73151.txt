Remote desktop to Mac with broken graphics card <body> We have a mac with a broken graphicscard (Lots of stripes etc.)  Is there some way to run it remotely without being disturbed by the graphics card?  This is a iMac G5 (PowerPC with everything in the screen).  The question is more for apps than the whole desktop.  <answer73157> Enable Desktop Sharing and use a VNC client to connect to it.  The VNC client built into OS X itself is very good and give good updates, so use that if you use another Mac for this.  <answer73170> Screen Sharing can be enabled via the terminal : strongsudo sh -c "/bin/echo -n enabled  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.ScreenSharing.launchd"/strong  I have had the AppleVNC service freak out because it couldn't determine the clients screen resolution.  <comment84929> Takk I have tried with Teamviewer (from Windows), and we still had the stripes.  Is using VNC or doing it from a Mac somehow different. <comment84934> Yes.  You need to use Desktop Sharing. <comment85068> I also see the graphics card problems remotely :-( <comment85162> Interesting.  I would guess it is a software problem and not a hardware problem, then.  Can you boot of the installation media and see if the problem persists? <comment85195> Its a kind of problem common in G5, related to damages to the graphics card: <comment85196> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3992999?start=0&tstart=0 <comment86010> Can I bypass the graphics card with  X-Windows? <comment86335> I have posted a related question about the X solution: <comment86336> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/74331/osx-as-x-windows-server
