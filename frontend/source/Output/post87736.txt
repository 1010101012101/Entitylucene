Should the Sudden Motion Sensor be disabled with a hybrid hard drive? <body> I've read that it's ok to leave the SMS on with non-stock hard drives, but I've also seen that it can crash an SSD.  I have a Momentus XT with 4GB of solid state memory and 500GB of spinning platters. What should be done with the SMS?  <comment102618> Is there any actual evidence that the sudden motion sensor damaged that SSD?  The Intel SSD 320 had a firmware bug and was perfectly capable of breaking itself without any help from the sudden motion sensor.  My company had one fail in the same fashion just sitting in a server. <comment102632> No, I don't have any evidence besides the link I gave in the post.
