Super slow browsing on rMBP until reboot <body> I've just experienced a couple of days of incredibly slow browsing (using Chrome mostly, but changing browser didn't help) on my home wi-fi. After trying many things like rebooting the router, removing devices from the network, diagnosing with iStumbler, requesting new DHCP leases, setting manual IPs, I eventually rebooted the machine and everything is back to normal.  What could cause this behaviour?   It's a mid 2014 Macbook Pro with Retina. The wi-fi is an ageing Dynalink that only supports 802.11b/g. I have a VPN installed but not active, and many apps:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HjU9s.png" alt="enter image description here"  It had probably been a few weeks or even a month since the last reboot.  Throughout all these problems, a Macbook Air on the same network worked just fine - so it's not a question of some weird network saturation.  <answer158813> That menu bar looks like you're on Mavericks. You should upgrade to Yosemite and see if that helps.  Speaking of which, if you haven't already, you should check how Internet-using apps that aren't web browsers perform, such as seeing how long it takes Dropbox to download a new file.  If all else fails, you should go to a place with a newer router and see if anything improves.  <comment186689> Ok, those are possible suggestions to fix the problem - but rebooting already fixed it. So I'm looking for diagnostic suggestions, or possible explanations. <comment186690> Have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257)? <comment186712> Was one of your (multiple) network drives eating it up ? <comment186720> By "network drive" you mean Google Drive or Dropbox? I don't think so - no significant activity that I recall. <comment186722> They would not do that in front of you, they might do it in background, but you can check the bandwidth (Internet) with the netstat or ls-la <comment186724> Sorry, I meant to use the lsof -i to see who is using your Internet.
