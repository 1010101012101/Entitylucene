Insert a tab character in PowerPoint 2016 <body> I defined a tab stop in the ruler  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TxG6w.png" alt="enter image description here"  And I would like to enter a tab character to move the cursor to the tab stop.  With older versions it was possible to enter special characters with eminsert symbol/em but I don't find the special characters anymore:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n6Hia.png" alt="enter image description here"  I also tried several key combinations as kbdshift/kbd+kbdtab/kbd, kbdoption/kbd+kbdtab/kbd or kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdtab/kbd without any effect.  I can I type/enter the kbdtab/kbd character?  <answer276488> codeKeynote/code is accepting kbdtab/kbd directly. Is much easier to use than any version of codePowerPoint/code and is able to output codePowerPoint/code format which is readable with many codePowerPoint/code versions.  My personnal experience is that codeKeynote/code is providing a more compatible codePowerPoint/code than any version of codePowerPoint/code, and is also much user friendly.  Actually I don't use codePowerPoint/code for quality and security reasons.  Then this part of advice is emuntested/em!  I suggest you to try:  kbdctrl/kbd+kbdQ/kbd, kbdtab/kbd  or:  kbdctrl/kbd+kbdV/kbd, kbdtab/kbd  <comment347973> Seems solved in the latest release <comment347974> The OP was asking about how to do this in Powerpoint 2016, not Keynote. I happen to agree with you that Keynote is superior in many ways to Powerpoint, and is my presentation app of choice, but the essential question remains unanswered, unfortunately. Perhaps you should make this a comment to the question, not an answer.
