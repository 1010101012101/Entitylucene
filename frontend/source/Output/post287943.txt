How to change the kind of news articles that show up in iPhone Spotlight? <body> There were previous questions explaining how to entirely remove the news from iPhone. However I like news and my iPhone homepage always shows news, but it is always anti trump and anti republican in general. 90% are headlines from anti republican websites like NYT, CNN, VOX, Washington Post etc.  How do I change it to neutral news that is sometimes anti trump but sometimes pro trump?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cmvjg.png" width="320" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0n6w6.png" width="320"  <comment363541> Find a site that has good news about trump, then use that as your news feed <comment363665> Fox news, breitbart and others are more pro trump. Even ABC and CBS, are a little more neutral. Also, my spotlight, usualy selects news that is against republicans in general, not only against trump.
