Setting the default browser <body> Is there any way to set the default web browser from within Mac OS?   I currently run Firefox 4 Beta, and haven't been able to find anywhere within the browser to set it as the default - possibly because it emis/em a Beta. However, this makes Chrome start up as soon as I click a link from somewhere other than within FF, which is a tad annoying.  <answer3910> ol liOpen Safari/li likbdâŒ˜,/kbd to open Preferences/li liOn the General tab there's a pull down that says 'Default web browser', the the one you want from the list/li /ol  <answer3911> You can also use "Default Apps" for change every default application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MYi2o.jpg" alt="alt text"  <comment3717> Where is this? Is this a plug-in or extension? <comment3719> It's 3rd-party app you can install it and use it in system preferences <comment3720> To think that it would be in another web browser! First slightly illogical preference I've seen from Apple. Thanks!
