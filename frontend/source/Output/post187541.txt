iTunes only showing Purchased Music <body> My iTunes is suddenly only showing music purchased through iTunes.  I have tried renaming the files per as mentioned on this Apple Support Communities thread and had no luck.  I am also not using iTunes Match.  <answer211192> In iTunes go to "File" - "Import Folders" then simply select strongall/strong the folders from your "iTunes Music". They will be sent to your library!  <comment221714> Are you sure you don't have hidden the navigation menu on the left side? Perhaps you have selected the "purchased" tab and then hidden the menu
