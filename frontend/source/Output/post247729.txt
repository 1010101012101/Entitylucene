macOS Sierra Public Beta 2 stuck at downloading <body> I have installed first public beta yesterday. Now App Store says there is a second update to public beta. There is no problem with network or internet at all but somehow update stucks at 0 bytes and no progress. Any suggestions to fix this problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rY30x.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment305709> Best not to delete a duplicate - they help the site point people to the main post when searching for a specific version.
