How do I sync Google Tasks to an iPhone? <body> I can sync my mail and calendar to Google from my iPhone via the GMail Exchange interface, but my GMail task list is not synced. How can I sync my tasks so that they show up in the built-in Reminders app?  <answer42544> There doesn't currently appear to be a way.  If you're willing to use an alternative to the built-in iOS Reminders, there's gTasks.  There is more information in the answers to this duplicate question: Sync Google Tasks with iOS Reminders?  <comment241886> Actually, there are two questions already dealing with this subject:  - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/37556/sync-google-tasks-with-ios-reminders  - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/127784/what-is-the-current-state-of-syncing-google-tasks-and-ios-reminders  As far as I know, there is no solution to sync *Google Tasks* with *iOS Reminders* at this moment. <comment241887> why do you recomend gTasks? Is it a reliable tool? Have you tried it?
