Could not determine GDB version using command: sudo /usr/local/bin/gdb --version <body> Eclipse (Mars) version (C programming language): Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers eclipse.buildId=4.5.0.I20150603-2000  MacOS version: OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 HW: MacbookPro 15" (mid-2015) Retina  Problem: Debug action causes following error message ("111" is both Project Name, and source 111.c file as well):  window title: "Problem Occurred" Error message:  'Launching 111' has encountered a problem.  Could not determine GDB version using command: sudo /usr/local/bin/gdb --version sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified  As far as I understand - that GBD module was removed from MacOS X, so I probably need to install manually one.  I am newcomer in Mac, and trying installing upon different forums - I didn't succeed yet.  Probably, there maybe changes required as well in:      Debug Configurations (Run-Debug Configuration-"Debugger" tab).    Or/and as well in:   Eclipse - Preferences - C/C++ - Debug - GDB   Please answer me - who installed recently by him-/her- self. Since old (more than year from now) forums may describe other case compared to problem I need to solve.  Please provide exact steps how to manage.  <answer194151> h1Install with MacPorts/h1  ol liInstall Xcode and MacPorts, if not already installed./li liNow install the Apple GCC and GDB from MacPorts:  $ sudo port install gdb-apple $ sudo port install apple-gcc42/li /ol  h1Install with Homebrew/h1  ol liInstall Xcode and Homebrew, if not already installed./li liNow install GDB from Homebrew:  $ brew tap homebrew/dupes $ brew install gdb/li /ol  Source: http://ntraft.com/installing-gdb-on-os-x-mavericks/  <answer194634> In addition to installing from macports / homebrew, on Yosemite you also need to sign the gdb binary. See http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin .  <comment231483> Modern OSX and Xcode do not provide gcc or gdb they provide clang and lldb . You might try lldb-mi https://www.codeplay.com/portal/lldb-mi-driver---part-1-introduction <comment231562> And what configuration changes are required in Eclipse IDE itself - to let it know to refer properly to newly this added installation ? Do I need both MacPorts and Homebrew - or they do similar job and any of them is enough ? And what about LLDB which as I understand replaces in MacOS X GDB - is it required as well ? Can't I just install GDB for most minimal changes, like latest Eclipse asks for ? Sorry for many questions - I just spend much time without deeply understand what all this modules stand for. And apple support can't help me till now :( <comment231564> You probably won't have to change anything. If eclipse doesn't see it, go to Preferences-C/C++-Debug-GDB and browse GDB Debugger at /usr/local/bin/gdb. You do not have to install both. I recommend [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager since it's easier to install and use. I don't think eclipse needs LLDB (not positive though). <comment231954> I performed both install with "MacPorts" and "Homebrew" steps above. But strange behaviour I see is - after closing and reopening Eclipse (without installing or removing any installation in between), it gives again same error message: 'Launching 111' has encountered a problem. Could not determine GDB version using command: sudo /usr/local/bin/gdb --version sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified". How can I make debugger stable - to work (without error) forever ? Is there any configuration in Eclipse required as well ? Why it can be such unstable ? Please provide steps to fix it. <comment232312> Welcome to Ask Different!
