The error "Keychain "login" cannot be found to store ..." <body> When I start up my MacBookPro/osx/snow leopard , I get this error with yahoo messenger..  What is this keychain thing? Is this some Mac thing?  Any links to explain this concept and how to resolve it?  Thanks,  <answer27078> Keychain is where Mac OS X saves stored passwords and other secure information. Without more information, I cannot debug your problem further, but it sounds as if Yahoo! Messenger expects to find a saved password for your account with them in your keychain, and is not finding it. The program Keychain Access, found in /Applications/Utilities, can help you view (and edit) keychain entries.  <answer143780> To fix this:  ul liRun Keychain Access (found in /Applications/Utilities)/li liclick "Keychain Access" in the menu bar at the top and select "Keychain First Aid". /li liRun the repair and then run verify./li /ul  That should fix it!  <answer261015> I just had the same issue in the brand new Mac I got today.  To solve it we just opened the Keychain Access tool and deleted the login keychain (it did not had an icon, signal for something strange happening).  Then I rebooted the Mac and... voil√†, rebooting solved it! Upon reboot it recreated a new working one.  I suppose the first one had been created by some corporate setup tool as root and my user, despite being an admin, could not access / write to it.  <answer286247> Here's a trick I tried with my MacBook Pro that seems to work:  ol liTurn on hidden files in Finder. Macworld has a good tutorial, just look for "view hidden files on mac." If you already have it turned on, skip to step 2./li liOpen Keychain Access. emYou'll likely see a keychain called "login" that's in BOLD and had a blank square for an icon, probably corrupted./em/li liClick "File"  "Add Keychain..."/li liUse the following file path to choose an archived keychain:  Macintosh HD (or whatever the name for your HD is)  Users  Admin em(will have house icon next to it)/em  Library  Keychains  login.keychain-randomcharacters.db &lt;-- this file will look like your average temp file.  Here's what my file path looked like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vlouq.png" alt="My file path" Use the List View and sort by "Date Modified" to find an archived keychain from just before the problem appeared. I found one from the day before the crash./li liClick on the file, add it to the keychain. Close every program properly, Reboot the computer through the OS; don't hardboot if you can avoid it./li liIf everything checks out, delete the old "login" keychain that's blank/weird. You're good to go. Hope it helps!/li /ol  For the record, here's the specs I was working with img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FhRr3.png" alt="My mac specs"  <comment30971> Can you clarify what is the error message, and what triggers it? A screenshot would be helpful. Is Yahoo Messenger a program that you have set to launch when you start up your computer? <comment60653> and once you have "Keychain Access" open, click "Keychain Access" in your menu bar at the top and select "Keychain First Aid". Run the repair and then run verify. <comment169349> @BradParks Make this an answer so I can up vote it. ;) <comment186043> Thanks @BradParks.  Note to future readers, Brad's answer has been added below. <comment186105> Have you looked at http://macosx.com/forums/mac-os-x-system-mac-software/297394-keychain-login-cannot-found-store-safari.html <comment318502> I'm not seeing any such menu item in El Capitan. <comment318513> Hmmm... It appears that [Apple removed this feature](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/219926/where-has-keychain-first-aid-gone) in El Capitan on... So I'll leave this here for users of older Mac OS versions. Note sure, but [maybe this will help](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134710/broken-login-keychain-what-now) solve the problem in a slightly different way
