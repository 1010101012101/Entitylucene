Homebrew gives a warning: "You have MacPorts or Fink installed" <body> I just got a new Mac Pro with OS X 10.9. When I run:  precodebrew doctor /code/pre  I get the warning:  precodeWarning: You have MacPorts or Fink installed: /opt/local/bin/port  This can cause trouble. You don't have to uninstall them, but you may want to  temporarily move them out of the way, e.g. sudo mv /opt/local ~/macports /code/pre  I didn't install MacPorts or Fink, why do I get the warning?  <answer120539> The error reports that code/opt/local/bin/port/code exists.  ul liIf you haven't installed it, the error is shown because the path exists. Move the executable:  precodesudo mv /opt/local/bin/port ~/Desktop /code/pre/li liIf you have installed it, you can run the command given:  precodesudo mv /opt/local ~/macports /code/pre/li /ul  <answer122996> Note that some 3rd-party packaging tools may sometimes automatically install MacPorts. I recall RVM does that (or at least used to, I don't know the current state), so while you're not aware of actually installing it manually, it might still be there.  If you move code/opt/local/code to a different location that might break whatever pulled in MacPorts in the first place.  <comment140537> The file `/opt/local/bin/port` is the MacPorts executable, thus it is installed. What happens if you try the commands `port version` and `port list installed`? I use both Homebrew and MacPorts and I get the warning but everything works fine for me :) <comment140604> i tried, but there's no port. "zsh: command not found: port" <comment140607> i didn't installed, and "port" doesn't exist. And there's no path "/opt/local/bin/port", it's wired. <comment140610> Meanwhile there's a 'bin" under '/opt/local', and there are many files like 'perl, openssl' etc. If i move it to '~/macports', won't it effect these executive files? Not very clear about this. <comment143571> Try /opt/local/bin/port version  etc - /opt/local/bin is not on yours or the default path <comment143572> How dod the files get in /opt/local/bin? Yi had to have installed something that did this <comment143573> This is not an answer and should be a comment <comment143575> It is one possible explanation for the question "I didn't install MacPorts or Fink, why do I get the warning?" asked in the original post. Since I do not see any other questions in the original post, I'd argue that this in fact *is* an answer. Of course, if you disagree and have the appropriate means to do so, feel free to make this a comment.
