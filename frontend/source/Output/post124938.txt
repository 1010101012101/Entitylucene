Mac Pro crashed and wants to recover files on hard drive <body> I have a Mac Pro and the motherboard is damaged and I'm trying to retrieve the files from the hard disk on my Windows 7 desktop. Can anyone tell me what software i can use?  Windows 7 cannot read HFS+  <answer124944> There are a number of programs that do this, MacDrive and HFS-Windows spring to mind. Both are commercial software but not especially expensive.  there is a freeware solution but I have never used it: HFSExplorer:  http://www.catacombae.org/hfsx.html  Will allow you to read only from HFS drives.
