How do I get "wget" for Snow Leopard? <body> There's no codewget/code command. How do I get it?  <answer12667> You will need to install Xcode with Unix Dev Support, then you can download and compile the source, or try macports, or homebrew.  code$ brew install wget/code  code$ sudo port install wget/code  Or you could try a graphical form which includes wget, like http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24787/cocoawget  <answer12668> Alternatively, if you don't need codewget/code specifically, Snow Leopard does come with codecurl/code which does many of the same things.   E.g., fetching your flair via codewget/code:  precodewget http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/2726.png /code/pre  vs. fetching it with codecurl/code:  precodecurl -O http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/2726.png /code/pre  Notably lacking from codecurl/code is codewget/code's code--mirror/code option, but it does have nifty fetching with patterns, which handles many of the same problems:  precode# Fetch flair images for users 2726 through 2730 curl -O http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/[2726-2730].png /code/pre  <answer12711> Probably the easiest and painless way to get wget is to install Homebrew. In fact, the very home page says:      Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn't include with OS X.   and their example is:  precode$ brew install wget /code/pre  ;)  <answer12718> To expand on Michael Granger's answer: codecurl/code (included on all Snow Leopard installs) is really quite powerful, and can do a lot of what codewget/code does (and a number of things it doesn't).  But, as noted on the curl FAQ:     1.3 What is curl not?      Curl is not a wget clone. That is a   common misconception. Never, during   curl's development, have we intended   curl to replace wget or compete on its   market. Curl is targeted at   single-shot file transfers.       Curl is not a web site mirroring   program. If you want to use curl to   mirror something: fine, go ahead and   write a script that wraps around curl   to make it reality (like curlmirror.pl   does).      ...   (For reference, here's that curlmirror.pl script)  <answer107457> If you don't want to use either homebrew or macports there is a great set of instructions here, reproduced below (using a slightly more up-to-date version of wget).  emThese instructions require both Xcode and the command line tools to be installed./em  First, use curl to download the latest wget source :  precodecurl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.14.tar.gz /code/pre  Next we use tar to uncompress the files you just downloaded:  precodetar -xzf wget-1.14.tar.gz /code/pre  Use cd to change to the directory:  precodecd wget-1.14 /code/pre  Configure with the appropriate code–with-ssl/code flag to prevent a “GNUTLS not available” error:  precode./configure --with-ssl=openssl /code/pre  Build the source:  precodemake /code/pre  Install wget, it ends up in code/usr/local/bin//code:  precodesudo make install /code/pre  Confirm everything worked by running wget:  precodewget --help /code/pre  Clean up by removing wget source files when finished:  precodecd .. &amp;&amp; rm -rf wget* /code/pre  <comment13298> I have Xcode installed, but where can I get the unix dev support? Could you give me step by step instructions ? <comment13316> http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/6490/capturadepantalla201004pd.png When installing xcode there should be a checkbox, just run through the installer again. The next part is installing either macports or homebrew https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew http://www.macports.org/install.php either of these package managers will allow you to download wget with ease once their are installed. <comment13361> Call me dumb, but do you have to pay the annual $99 fee to be part of the Mac Developer program to get Xcode? <comment13365> You are not dumb at all, unfortunately apple changed around xcode 4 so its either 5 bucks for the package or 99 to be in the dev program. Its annoying because all we want are the OSS headers and stuff. But if you have your original os x dvd you can install xcode right off of there. http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.xcode.html
