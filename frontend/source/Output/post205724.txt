Can't download apps after changing Apple ID password <body> I changed my Apple ID password, after that I can't download apps, even free apps. It says need verification of payment info. Now what to do...?  <answer205735> Go to codeAppStore &gt; Store (top menu) &gt; View my account/code and check your payment info - you might have a link there that will help you reauthenticate payment info. If that won't help - change something in payment info, that should trigger reauthenticate process.
