How to install vim 7.4a with homebrew <body> I installed vim with codehomebrew/code on my macbook  codebrew install macvim/code  but the version I wish was 7.4a, the latest beta release, how can I install it?  <answer98452> For me,  codebrew info macvim/code  told me this:     macvim: stable 7.3-66, devel 7.4b-BETA-69, HEAD   And as such, I would have to do this:  codebrew install macvim --devel/code
