How do I remove a device listed in Airplay options <body> I have been evaluating Reflector.app, and am now purchasing a license, however while evaluating it, it created many, many entries for the computer I was running it on. I have tried rebooting both the computer and the iDevice, even making sure that they were both off at the same time, but to no avail - how can I get rid of these entries?
