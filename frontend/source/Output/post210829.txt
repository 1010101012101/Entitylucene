Unable to sign in with my Apple ID after updating my iPhone <body> I got a notification to update the software on my iPhone 4S (A1387), so I updated it. After updating completed, it asked to sign in with your Apple ID.  I tried to sign in with my Apple ID, then it asked me to agree to some terms and conditions.  After I agreed to those, it is now showing notification strongCould Not Sign In/strong several times. So having updated, I am now unable to sign in with my Apple ID.  <comment254497> Can you provide your old/new OS version and some screens ? <comment254498> If you're using your data connection, go find a useable wifi - or vice versa. <comment254501> I am using wifi only
