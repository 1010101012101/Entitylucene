Applescript - Connection is invalid <body> I have an application for mac and I use the following applescript code (exported as an AS app) to start that app periodically:  precodeon idle     tell application "System Events"         tell application "MyApp"             run         end tell         return 7     end tell end idle /code/pre  I use [NSApp terminate:self] in MyApp to terminate itself after it finished its work.  The problems is that the AS script displays a "Connection is invalid" error message when it tries to run MyApp the second time and onward. The error does not show up in the first launch.  I'm guessing [NSApp terminate:self] is causing the conflict with the AS somehow, but why?  <answer66776> In the end I used NSTimer to automate my code.  Rather then using the applescript to launch the app periodically, I have the app run constantly and use NSTimer within my app to fire a specific method from time to time.  precode[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:2.0     target:self     selector:@selector(targetMethod:)     userInfo:nil     repeats:NO]; /code/pre  This way the app is never killed and does not have to be restarted.  <comment78633> Could you give some more info on how you solved your problem for future reference? <comment78646> Sure, I edited my answer.
