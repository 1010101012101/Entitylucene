AppleScript to compare contacts in two groups and remove duplicate from one group <body> I want to create an AppleScript for Apple's Address Book (Contacts) app that will look at two Groups, and if a contact is in one Group, it will remove it from the other Group.  Specifically, I add potential clients to my Address Book so I can color-code their messages in Mail.app. They are added to a "Work - Pending" group. Once the project goes forward, I add them to a "Work - Current" group. The AppleScript would compare the two, look for duplicates and remove them from the 'Pending' group.  <answer61140> Here is a  script written quickly. Should work. But I have not revised it down to be efficient.  precodetell application "Contacts"      (*get the names of all groups *)     set theGroupNames to name of groups      (*choose you current group, the one to keep entries*)     set text_returnedCurrent to choose from list theGroupNames with prompt "Choose Current Group" default items "Work - Current" without multiple selections allowed      (*choose you pending group, the one to remove entries*)     set text_returnedPending to choose from list theGroupNames with prompt "Choose Pending Group" default items "Work - Pending" without multiple selections allowed     (*Get the people/entries of the Current group*)     set the_peopleCurrent to people of group (text_returnedCurrent as text)      (*Get the people/entries of the Pending group*)     set the_peoplePending to people of group (text_returnedPending as text)      (*iterate through the people of the Current group*)     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in the_peopleCurrent          (*get a person from the  Current group*)         set thisPersonCurrent to item i of the_peopleCurrent          (*iterate through ALL the people of the Pending group**)         repeat with x from 1 to number of items in the_peoplePending              (*get a person from the  Pending group*)             set thisPersonPending to item x of the_peoplePending              (*Check if the person from the Current group is the same person as thisPersonPending*)             if thisPersonCurrent is equal to thisPersonPending then                 (* if they are remove them.  *)                 remove thisPersonPending from group (text_returnedPending as text)                  (*save the contacts changes*)                 save              end if         end repeat      end repeat  end tell /code/pre  <comment70564> That did the trick, thank you very much! I am going to see if I can pare it down for the two specific Groups I need to do this with. But this works exactly as I needed. <comment70607> You are welcome. The paring down should be easy to do. I did it this way to make it useable for others.
