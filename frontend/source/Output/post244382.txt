Adding a face in Photos <body> I am running macOS El Capitan 10.11.5, and in Photos I am unable to add a face. When I go open the ‘Info’ window, I do not get the option to add a face.  I can only add a description or a keyword, and assign a location, but not add a face.  Some faces have been automatically detected, including objects like car wheels, but several faces have been ignored. Any help would be appreciated.  <answer244428> You have to blow up the photo to add Faces to them. Just double-click the photo, and strong⊕ Add Faces/strong will appear in the Info panel between strongAdd Keyword/strong and strongAssign a Location/strong.  <comment301320> This worked for me.  Thankyou.
