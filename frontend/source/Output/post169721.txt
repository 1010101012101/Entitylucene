File's image well displays PNG icon not actual PNG <body> I would like to replace the standard icon for an Automator application that I created with a PNG.  Unfortunately, the resulting icon is the generic PNG icon, not the emactual/em PNG image.  Steps:  ul lidownloaded the desired image (512 x 512)/li liverified that the image had a transparent background/li liOpened the file's inspector window (kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdI/kbd):/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1puUP.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liDragged the PNG to the image well:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jWZcA.png" alt="enter image description here"  The final result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sqa0I.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to get the actual icon to be used?  <answer169737> Copy paste the code.png/code image onto the icon shown in the Inspector.  ol liOpen the code.png/code with Preview/li liSelect all with kbdCMD/kbd+kbdA/kbd/li liCopy with kbdCMD/kbd+kbdC/kbd/li liSelect the application of which you want to change the icon./li liPress kbdCMD/kbd+kbdI/kbd to open the Inspector/li liClick on the icon and paste the copied image using kbdCMD/kbd+kbdV/kbd/li /ol  I have no clue why that works differently compared to dragging and dropping the image.  <answer273797> Also, the above worked for me, but only after I was still having some puzzling difficulties, so if that's you, on your desktop (make sure you are clicked on your desktop) go up to the top, to Finder - View - Show View Options  ... and use the little slider to adjust the size of your icons, slide it back and forth, even back to where it started and I found for me that for some strange reason my icon just popped up. (I was trying to get a new transparent icon the image for a Hard Drive and all I was getting was a standard PNG graphic but when I used the slider, it changed to my new icon. Go figure.)  <comment199410> Have you tried copy-pasting the image? I.e.: open .png in Preview,select all, copy, open inspector on automator app, click on icon and press cmd+v. <comment199413> OK, that worked.  Why?  What's difference between the two approaches? <comment199423> Is your Finder configured to show the icon or the preview of an image file? If it's set to show the icon, then this might be the culprit.
