Easy PDF word count <body> What is the 'easiest' way to get word (and/or page) count of PDFs?   By 'easy' I mean 'an app where you can read/annotate the PDF and get word count as well, without having to resort to clunky copying/pasting'. I know one can copy/paste things from any PDF reader into Word/Pages and get this info. I'd rather hear about a more practical/robust solution.   Ideally I'd want to know if this is available (in this order of preference):  ol liIn Preview (my default PDF reader)/li liIn another PDF reading app (which I'd be happy to make default)/li /ol  If the above doesn't exist, I'd also be content with programmes that do word/page count exclusively (although you won't be able to read/annotate the PDF). Ideally in this order of preference:  ol start="3" liAn app with a GUI/li liA command line programme/li /ol  Thanks for any ideas!  <answer239546> strongWordService/strong from DEVONtechnologies will do statistics (count words, characters, lines) on seleced text. Page count is shown in the titlebar of Preview.br It does more than statistics, like uppercase, lowercase, converting tabs to spaces or vice-versa, date and time functions, etc.br And as it is a Service-provider it's available in all Cocoa apps via the Services menu or contextual menus under the Services heading.    DEVON's products pagebr Look under the Freeware section. Available from their website and the Mac  App Store.  <comment293988> http://superuser.com/questions/221359/count-the-number-of-words-in-a-pdf-file <comment294242> This is precisely the kind of thing I was looking for. One minor remark: I wasn't aware that I needed to restart the system after installing WordService from the AppStore. I spent quite some time looking for the service in Preview and System Preferences, before trying restarting the system. After a restart, WordService was active in Preview and configurable in System Preferences. If more people stumble upon this question, your answer will be even more helpful if you mention that the system might have to be restarted after installing the app. Thank you loads for solving my problem! <comment294244> Thank you. This is an idea, although my least preferred solution. @PeterVP (below) suggested a solution that suits my needs better. <comment294314> It has been so long ago that I installed it the first time (on OS X 10.2?) that I forgot that a restart is required.  I just checked the Help file, and it says logging out and in again should do the trick
