macOS Sierra 10.12.3 iCloud email is STILL in system preferences after signing out <body> strongStory:/strong Okay, so I have this "old" Mac which was fully signed in and connected to my Apple ID. But now that I have a newer Mac, I want emfully/em sign out of the older Mac. So I navigate to codeSystem Preferences&gt;iCloud&gt;Sign out/code.  Click Sign out, wait a moment, and it says it signed out.   strongProblem:/strong However when I navigate back to iCloud in System Preferences, inside 1 of the 2 sign-in boxes is my email I use for Apple ID.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbxEQ.png" alt="iCloud Settings"  I tried everything I could think of, but the stubborn thing just won't forget my email. And I don't like the fact that if someone were to snoop on it, they would have half of the information they need.   Any ideas? Thanks in advance.  <answer277311> Well after a few hours of continuously searching for what is causing the problem, I finally found it.   strongSolution:/strong Turns out that I was still somehow connected (Not signed-in) to Game Center inside System PreferencesInternet account. After I deleted that, it finally forgot the Apple ID email.
