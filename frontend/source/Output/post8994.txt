Turn off Anti-Aliasing on Mac <body> This is a followup to the Stack Overflow question, Why does there appear to be a different number of unique colors available on the Mac as compared to Windows?  How can I turn off anti-aliasing on a Mac, either through manual settings or, more preferably, while doing a screen capture (i.e., when I capture the screen, I need the raw data without anti-aliasing algorithms applied)?   <answer8998> Does the codeCommand/code + codeOption/code + code\/code helps?  This option keys disable the Anti Aliasing when doing the Zoom (using Ctrl + Scroll)  <answer9003> You can manually turn off font-antialiasing with this terminal command:  precodedefaults write CoreGraphics CGFontDisableAntialiasing YES /code/pre  to turn antialiasing back on again use this:  precodedefaults write CoreGraphics CGFontDisableAntialiasing NO /code/pre  <comment9600> Thanks for Quick response. Even with Anti Aliasing OFF, i see around 250 different colors for small block of text. Is there any way to get less unique colors for same block, as On Windows it shows only 2 colors for same block with Anti Aliasing Off. Appreciate your quick responses.
