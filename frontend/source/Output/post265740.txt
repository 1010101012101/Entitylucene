Caps Lock key not working <body> The caps lock key in my MacBook Pro (mid 2015, running MacOS Sierra 10.12) is not working. When I press it, the led doesn't turn on and it has no effect. However, if I logout from my account and go back to the login screen, then it works normally, which means it is some user preference setting. (by working normally I mean the led turns on and the sign of caps lock turned on appears in the password field)  The problem is, I have no idea what kind of setting it might be. In the system preferences, under keyboard, caps lock is assigned its normal function. I do have a few apps for remapping system input: Karabiner, BetterTouchTool and USB Overdrive, but I don't have any setting involving caps lock in any of them.  <answer265781> I understand this problem is often caused by Karabiner Elements.  <comment333192> Do you use any non Latin keyboards?  In sierra caps lock can be set to switch between Latin and non Latin.  Also I have heard karabiner can cause your problem. <comment333243> Turns out it was a bug in Karabiner-Elements. The developer is aware of it but still has no fix. Please repost your comment as an answer so I can accept it.
