Standard Mac keyboard mapping in VirtualBox? <body> I am using differents Unix in VirtualBox on my Macs (MacBook Pro, iMac). I have standard QWERTY keyboards so as to be able to type fluently:  ul liEnglish/li liFrench/li liGerman/li liUNIX shell/li liprogramming languages: C, Perl, make/li /ul  With the standard Apple keyboard mapping I am able to type very quickly:  precodeé, É, œ, Œ, à, À, î, Î, ç, Ç, û, Û, ß, ü, Ü…  !, @, #, $, {, }, [, ], ~, ', `, /, \, |, &amp;… /code/pre  This mapping is:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KJQZl.png" alt="QWERTY keyboard"  and with either the left or right kbdoption/kbd depressed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tzhvv.png" alt="QWERTY alt keyboard"  This mapping is very easy to memorize since it only uses 5 kbdoption/kbd sequences (introduced by the keys in orange) which are on keys most frequently used with the letter on the same key. For example, to type an codeé/code, I have to type kbdoption/kbd+kbde/kbd, kbde/kbd  hr  I would like to use the exact same keyboard mapping of my Mac in Unix environments (I mean not just for kbdcommand/kbd+kbdc/kbd).  My experiments with codexmodmap/code proved that I can achieve the exact same keyboard function, but with a few hundred lines of codexmodmap/code file for each keyboard.  What is the clean and general method to get the complete Apple keyboard mapping on the virtual Unix running inside VirtualBox?
