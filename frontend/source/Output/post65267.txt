How do I find out what my Apple vendor ID is? <body> I'm doing some Apple iTunes Connect reporting via the Autoingest tool.  It requires that I not only specify login account info, but also a "vendorid".  I have no clue what our vendor ID might be.  Where can I find such info on Apple's site?  <answer65284> Click on the strongSales and Trends/strong section, and your vendor ID will be displayed in the upper-left corner next to your developer name. It should start with an 8.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Aq9e.png" alt="sales &amp; trends"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qqrw0.png" alt="vendor id"  (Source: discussions.apple.com thread)  <answer93903> Apparently the latest version of the Autoingestion script is looking for a 10 digit version of the ID.   If you stick two zero's in front of the number it gives you on the Sales and Trends page that will work...  <answer121447> This number may be a bit harder to find since Apple re-designed iTunes Connect on Mon, Feb 17th, 2014.   Multiple vendors: If you go into the monthly financial section and have multiple vendors a drop down will show up in the upper left with this number.   If you only have one vendor: Download a monthly financial report. The vendor id is the long number at the beginning of the report name before the first underscore.  <answer158151> With the new iTunesConnect, you don't actually have to download a financial report to get the Vendor ID.  Go to "Sales and Trends", then choose "Reports" from the drop-down menu in the top left.  On the next screen, there'll be a drop-down menu for "Vendor". Your name and ID will be shown there.  <comment76662> Developer questions are best suited for Appleâ€™s Developer Forums.

We've been [discussing making iTunes connect on-topic](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1038/what-would-happen-if-we-expanded-the-scope-of-this-site-to-include-itunes-connec) for a while, and this looks like a good test case. <comment217076> This is not the case anymore. My 8 digit id works fine. Adding 2 zeros gives me an error "Please enter a valid vendor number". <comment289264> This is no longer correct.
