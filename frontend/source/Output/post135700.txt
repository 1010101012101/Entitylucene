How to remove outdated casks from Homebrew? <body> I am using homebrew-cask to keep my ecosystem of applications up-to-date. It is great when maintaining several computers at home, travel or on the go.   However, when some packages are getting updated (such as Google Chrome), I end up having different concurrent versions installed (and which are seen by the OS):     $ ls /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/google-chrome/   latest  stable-channel   This happens when upgrading a cask:  precode$ ls -l /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/tunnelblick total 0 drwxr-xr-x 5 foo staff 238 Mar 11 07:42 3.3.0 drwxr-xr-x 5 foo staff 238 May 13 13:53 3.3.2 [13:00:40] foo at bar in ~ $ brew cask install --force tunnelblick ==&gt; Caveats For security reasons, Tunnelblick must be installed to /Applications and will request to be moved at launch.  ==&gt; Downloading https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/tunnelblick/All%20files/Tunnelblick_3.3.4.dmg ######################################################################## 100.0% ==&gt; It seems there is already an App at '/Applications/Tunnelblick.app'; not linking.   tunnelblick installed to '/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/tunnelblick/3.3.4' (236 files, 20M)  $ ls -l /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/tunnelblick total 0 drwxr-xr-x 5 foo staff 238 Mar 11 07:42 3.3.0 drwxr-xr-x 5 foo staff 238 May 13 13:53 3.3.2 drwxr-xr-x 5 foo staff 238 Jun 26 13:01 3.3.4 [13:01:26] foo at bar in ~ /code/pre  How do I only keep the most recent?  <answer236481> In Terminal, type:  precodefor app in $(brew cask list); do cver="$(brew cask info "${app}" | head -n 1 | cut -d " " -f 2)"; ivers=$(ls -1 "/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/${app}/.metadata/" | tr '\n' ' ' | sed -e 's/ $//'); aivers=(${ivers}); nvers=$(echo ${#aivers[@]}); echo "[*] Found ${app} in cask list.

If questions are answered the same then the **question** should be flagged/closed as a duplicate <comment289713> hi @name, could you edit your answer to know what it does, seems cryptic (my quote of the day: "stackoverflow is not about solutions, but about answers" :-) ) <comment289814> To the individuals that keep trying to edit this post changing the given complex command line in to a script, please stop!  The author wrote it as a complex command line, not a script. Please respect the authors decision to post it as a complex command line, not a script! <comment302496> Remember with the new Homebrew Caskroom location you need to change `/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/` to `/usr/local/Caskroom/`. <comment314697> Still looking for an answer. My latest attempts involve removing all applications and reinstalling, not very ecological. <comment324822> Just an FYI for those running this in future, it seems it's uninstalling/reinstalling all of my casks. Doesn't seem to properly detect my installed version? "[*] Found atom in cask list. Latest available version is 1.11.2. You have installed version(s):"
