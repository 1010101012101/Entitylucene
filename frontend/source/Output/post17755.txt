How do I add a new route to the PATH variable? <body> Although this question is being answered many times, I could not find any help from previous posts, so here it is again.  I have tried to add a new route to PATH variable with no success.   I have added the following command:   precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/zend/share/ZendFramework/bin /code/pre  to this files one at a time: ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc  After starting a new Terminal session I type  precodeenv /code/pre  but the PATH variable never show the changes.  EDIT:  Seems that none of this files are being read when opening terminal, other routes where in this files and they are not being added either. On starting terminal I get this message "-bash: : command not found". If I execute  precodesource ~/.profile /code/pre  I get the route added to the PATH but it does not keep for the next Terminal session. How can I test what is happening on Terminal startup?  This are the contents of the files:  ~/.profile  precodeexport PATH=/applications/MAMP/bin/php5.3/bin/:$PATH export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH export MANPATH=/opt/local/share/man:$MANPATH export PATH=/usr/local/zend/share/ZendFramework/bin:$PATH /code/pre  ~/.bashrc  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/zend/bin LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/zend/lib /code/pre  ~/.bash_profile is empty  None of the routes in any of them are displayed after typing  precodeenv /code/pre  in Terminal.  <answer17757> Try changing the export to:  precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/zend/share/ZendFramework/bin:$PATH /code/pre  in your ~/.profile  <answer17820> well first off you only really need it in  ~/.bash_profile if you have one.  Second opening a new terminal session without quitting terminal app will not source the  ~/.bash_profile file.  You can just type "source  ~/.bash_profile" in the terminal and it should pick up your new settings.  Or quit terminal.app and restart it.  <answer17916> The problem is in how you are testing the changes.  Run the following command in Terminal to test your changes.  codesource ~/.profile/code  Once it looks correct, start a new window and re-verify the settings.  Every time you run the source command it will add the same path to your $PATH variable.  <comment19410> Put some echo lines in the files to see what gets executed <comment19584> You're doing it right. That should work. <comment19663> I always quit and restart Terminal to verify the changes. <comment19664> Marconcini, there is no difference is setting the new route after or before the previous PATH. <comment19665> the `source`command works but only while the session is not closed. See my edits to the post. <comment19667> @Mark, what do you mean with adding echo lines? <comment19670> echo - $PATH will print out the path , put different echo "comment" in the files to show which ones are being used <comment19678> @Mark, I have added `echo ".profile is used"` and similar lines to .bashrc and .bash_profile and none of this lines are displayed after starting Terminal, but opening terminal I always get the message "-bash: : command not found". <comment19680> In Terminal Preferences what are values of "Shells open with" and also Settings-Shell-Run command <comment19681> @Mark, "Shell open with: default login shell(/usr/bin/login)", "Run command: unchecked and empty". <comment28720> +1, the changes always need to go into bash_profile on OS X, .profile never works from the home directory only from /etc/, so bash_profile is the recommended place to go.
