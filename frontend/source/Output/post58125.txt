Recycle a Macbook Pro into an external monitor <body> I recently bought a new Retina Macbook Pro and I would like to know I could in some way recycle the old one into a external display.  So is there some way to use a Macbook Pro as an external monitor?  I know I could use ScreenRecycler, but I'd prefer a "wired" solution.  <answer58129> Use target display mode and a hook the two together using your Thunderbolt port (on new Retina) and mini-displayport on old macbook.  See more here: Target Display Mode  <comment66882> Target display mode only applies to iMacs, and it will not work with MacBook Pros.
