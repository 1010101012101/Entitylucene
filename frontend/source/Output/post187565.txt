Set Bash Variable as Icon in osascript -e Display Dialog with icon <body> I have a bash script that utilizes some codeosascript -e/code code for a dialog. I want to use a custom icon in that dialog. However, I don't understand how to code it so it's completely portable so as to make it executable no matter where a user may put it in his file system. precode cd "$(dirname "$0")/../../" CONTENTS="$PWD" export ICNSPATH="$CONTENTS/Resources/path/to/icon/Myicon.icns" osascript -e 'tell application id "com.apple.systemuiserver"' -e 'display dialog "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet." buttons {"Cancel", "Okay"} with icon '$ICNSPATH' as alias' -e 'end tell' /pre/code Currently the only way I can get it to work with a custom icon is by hard coding it and I don't think it is a good idea.  Solutions should be w/o add-ons and must work on Mac OSes 10.6 - 10.10.  Appreciate any help you can render.  <answer187567> What always will work is encoding the icon file with codebase64 -b 64/code (to keep the lines short enough), include it into your shell script as a here document and decode it on the fly.  To create a base64 encoded version of your icon file, run  precodebase64 -b 64 -i path/to/icon/Myicon.icns &gt; myicon.base64 /code/pre  (This you only need to do once).  Then open your shell script in your editor and eminsert/em codemyicon.base64/code (which might be rather big) in the correct spot   precode... ICNSPATH=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/icon.$$.icns base64 -D -o $ICNSPATH &lt;&lt;"END_OF_ICON" ** replace with content of myicon.base64 ** END_OF_ICON  osascript -e '... with icon '$ICNSPATH' as alias' # write full command here rm -f $ICNSPATH /code/pre  The final script will then look like the following   precode... ICNSPATH=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/icon.$$.icns base64 -D -o $ICNSPATH &lt;&lt;"END_OF_ICON" aG93IHRvIGNvZGUgaXQgc28gaXQncyBjb21wbGV0ZWx5IHBvcnRhYmxlIHNvIGFz ... eSBwdXQgaXQgaW4gaGlzIGZpbGUgc3lzdGVtLgoK END_OF_ICON  osascript -e '... with icon '$ICNSPATH' as alias' rm -f $ICNSPATH /code/pre  <comment221744> How do you install/deploy the script? There seems to be some folder structure implied in your script. <comment221776> Thanks for your answer, but it's way over my head, I don't have the first idea how to use it. <comment221817> I've added some more details <comment221938> @patrix It is used in a wine-wrapped application using the free, open source Wineskin application. <comment221939> You did help me with my thinking and logic, and I think you for that, but I found a better way accomplish my goal of using a custom icon in my script. Now I just copy the icon to /tmp and delete it when the script completes. <comment221940> I was interrupted in above comment, should say "I thank you for that".
