Position Dock stretched full width without increasing size proportionally <body> Using  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock pinning start;killall Dock /code/pre  I was able to move the position of the dock to the upper left corner below the Apple menu.  What I'd really like to do is force the dock to take up the full space available with empty space like this mock..  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8601; Current &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wanted &#8600;   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFetc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer146745> Was hoping to find an alternative solution but I was able to achieve what I wanted by   precodedefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}' /code/pre  running that command several times (5 times actually) created 5 spaces in the dock which I just placed to one side to make it long enough to fill up the full height.  Now it looks like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NbVoH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment373641> It seems this doesn't work anymore
