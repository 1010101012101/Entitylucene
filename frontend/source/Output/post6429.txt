How can I find which account I used for downloading my iOS apps? <body> I use three different accounts for downloading from the App Store, each in a different country.  When there is an update, I have to connect to the correct App Store to download the update, but sometimes I can't remeber from which store an app was downloaded and so I need to connect to each one in turns.  I would like to be able to find the account I used to download an app so that I can connect to the correct App Store immediately. Also, this would enable me to verify if the app already exists in the App Store of my main account and buy/download it from there.   <answer6430> I would log in to each account and check your purchase history. That seems like the most direct way to me. This Apple article has details on how to do this.  <answer6437> In iTunes you can simply right click the app in question and choose Get Info. On the summary tab you can see the account used to purchase the app. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9psgm.png" alt="alt text"  <comment6705> I was hoping the information was available somewhere inside the iTunes Library, just not displayed at the GUI, and that I could find that reading some file. <comment6706> And the purchase history is separated in invoices, repeats the app for each update I downloaded and mixes iOS apps with OSX apps.
