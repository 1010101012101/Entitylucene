Getting data from jailbroken first generation iPhone on new computer (screen is defunct) <body> I'm trying to get data (mostly photos and notes) from my first generation iPhone that is jailbroken (I believe it is on iOS3) but I am unable to unlock the phone because the right hand portion of the screen is dysfunctional and does not register my touches.  I do not access to my old computer that I used to use to sync with this phone so there are no backups that could be retrieved so I was wondering if there is any other solution?  <comment42200> Is OpenSSH installed? <comment42201> Not really sure StackOverflow is the place to ask. Perhaps SuperUser? <comment42202> You can grab the data using either OpenSSH either the USB cable (google the famous AFC protocol and AFC2Add Cydia package). <comment42203> OpenSSH is installed, but I have no way of accessing my wireless data (as I can't even get to the homescreen) <comment42204> use iExplorer, it works really great
