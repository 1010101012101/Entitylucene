Change location of screenshots mac <body> Right now they default to desktop, and I followed instructions found here. It works up until I shut down the computer; I was wondering if there was a permanent solution?  Why was this downvoted? I have all my attempts linked and was having a genuine problem with it  <answer258696> The terminal command below will work to changing your screenshot location. The only problem is the path location must always be available or else it'll default back to ~/Desktop  Example, if you set the path to a /Volume/USBflashdrive and remove it or at some point doesn't become available, it'll revert back to the defaults.  Terminal command:   precode  defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /FULL/PATH/HERE/TO/LOCATION /code/pre  Only thing you need to change is the /FULL/PATH/HERE/TO/LOCATION. This can be found from the Finder by right clicking on your chosen folder. Then, after the context menu appears, hold the option key to change codeCopy "***"/code to codeCopy "***" as Pathname/code so you can paste it into the terminal as the replacement for the example path I provided above in the command block.  edit: Also want to add this terminal command works from Mac OS X 10.10 Mavericks, OS X 10.11 Yosemite, and OS X 10.12 Sierra. I believe this works from OS X 10.7 Lion to 10.12 Sierra but I'm not positive.  <answer262112> Found this tutorial from Google.com  By that, just create a new folder somewhere else where you want to store screenshot. For example, Desktop - Screenshots  Then perform this command in Terminal.  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/username/Desktop/Screenshots /code/pre  <comment322926> I use [Tinker Tool](https://www.bresink.com/osx/0TinkerTool/download.php) to change the screenshot location to a folder called "Screenshots" inside the Pictures folder. It's free. It only works with macOS Sierra. <comment322931> What location did you change it to? <comment322933> Run the Terminal command as a startup item. <comment322949> Any `defaults write` command should be permanent, whether done from Terminal, Tinker Tool, Onyx etc they all actually implement the same command. Try this in Terminal `defaults read com.apple.screencapture location` before & after a reboot & let us know the result[s]. <comment328342> How does this answer differ from the previous accepted one?
