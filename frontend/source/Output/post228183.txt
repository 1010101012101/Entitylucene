Accept Xcode 7.3 license <body> I want to install a C/C++ compiler for Matlab R2015b. I am running OSX El Capitan 10.11.3.  I installed the newest version of Xcode (Xcode Version 7.3 beta 3).  According to MathWorks, Xcode 7.x should be compatible with Matlab R2015b. http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2015b/index.html?sec=maci64 I also followed the additional steps to add support for Xcode 7.0 in MATLAB R2015b (this is the most recent post by MathWorks regarding using any Xcode 7.x) http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/246507-why-can-t-mex-find-a-supported-compiler-in-matlab-r2015b-after-i-upgraded-to-xcode-7-0#answer_194526  When I run "mex -setup" in Matlab I get the following error message:  precodeWarning: Xcode is installed, but its license has not been accepted. Run Xcode and accept its license agreement. /code/pre  I have already tried the following in my terminal: sudo xcodebuild -license  It loads the license and I am able to scroll through and type "agree". Still, Matlab gives me the same error.  <comment278179> Have you tried to run Xcode and agree the license there? <comment278184> Have you tried `xcode-select -reset` to make sure that the xcodebuild in the path is the one matlab is calling? I just had this mess up homebrew where I deleted a debug version of Xcode, but some of the tools were "missing" <comment278186> I have tried but the license does not show up when you open the application. @bmike - I just tried the reset but still no luck. Note that Matlab recognizes that Xcode is installed, but it cannot find that I agreed to the license. <comment278187> I wonder if it's some odd thing in the user environment. If you log out or reboot, does gcc also complain that the license is bad? `$ gcc --version` should put out text like...  `Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)` <comment278222> No complaints that the license is bad. Only have issues when trying to do     "mex -setup" in Matlab. Here is the terminal output for gcc --version  Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.21) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.3.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin <comment278258> Downgraded to the latest stable release of Xcode, 7.2.1. Initially froze when verifying but was able to remedy this by bypassing the OSX gatekeeper with the command xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Xcode.app in the Applications directory. Now it works! Thanks everyone for your suggestions.
