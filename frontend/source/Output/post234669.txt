Is there any App where I can show where I click on an non-jailbroken iPad? <body> I am using a mirroring app to present to people in a different geographic location, and I need to show them where I am clicking using different Apps, I know that PPT and Keynote already have those capabilities, but we are using iBooks and other Apps (in-house developments)  Thank you in advance!  <answer234680> If you are recording this for future playback, I recommend ScreenFlow. You can enable the setting for a visual indication of taps and clicks in the video, which makes it very easy to follow.  Edit: Highlighter does what you're looking for.  <answer234702> If you're willing to shell out $20, I believe Reflector can do it and it has nice graphics additions for screen recordings (someone correct me if I'm wrong).  <comment287166> Thank you, no, I need it for live presentations and meetings <comment287169> @edoliver see my edit. <comment287339> I have Reflector2 and updated to the latest release, the iPad and the Mac cannot connect (Mirroring360 can, but it does not have the "pointer" option) <comment287340> Thank you! Apparently Highlighter works only with OS X? I need it for iOS though (either way I am keeping it for my Mac)
