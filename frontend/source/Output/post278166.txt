Does updating to a newer version of macOS change kernel extensions? <body> Lets assume I replace a standardized kernel extension of Apple with a third party extension will updating to a newer version change that extension back to the original kext. Or will my third party kext be working.  <comment350153> If you're thinking of a specific 3rd party kext it'd be useful to include that in your question, and the Apple kext it'd be replacing (even if you're also asking about kexts in general).
