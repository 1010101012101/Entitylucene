MacPorts can't recognize Xcode version properly <body> I've tried to run the following command to install "automake" package on my Mac:  precodeMacBook:~ administrator$ sudo port install automake Password: Error: The installed version of Xcode (5.1.1) is too old to use on the installed OS version. Version 6.1 or later is recommended on Mac OS X 10.10. To report a bug, follow the instructions in the guide:     http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets Error: Processing of port automake failed /code/pre  The problem is shown in the line:      Error: The installed version of Xcode (5.1.1) is too old to use on the   installed OS version. Version 6.1 or later is recommended on Mac OS X   10.10.   But there is Xcode 6.1 installed on my Mac. I'm using OS X 10.10 Yosemite (MacPorts for 10.10 already installed).  <answer164875> You need to run codexcode-select --switch [path]/code as descriped here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9600615/xcode-stops-working-after-set-xcode-select-switch  And here is Apples documentation: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcode-select.1.html  <answer164881> I had encountered this frustrating situation as well. Reinstalling Xcode 6.1 and then running 'xcode-select' solved the problem.
