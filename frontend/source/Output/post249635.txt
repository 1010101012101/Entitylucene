Tabs don't open in the background any longer in Safari <body> Whenever I right click on a link in Safari and click "Open Link In New Tab" it leads me directly to it/ immediatley takes me to the new tab. Before, ever since I got my macbook, whenever I opened a link in a new tab it left it running in the background. It was more convinient for me and it was faster.  PS: And before you ask, yes I have tried fixing the "Tab" setting in Safari Preferences  <answer249647> You can follow these steps 1. Open preference in safari 2. Click on tabs. 3. Uncheck the option "when a when a new tab or window opens make it      active".  Hope this will works.  <comment309737> Could there be a possibility that your Shift key is pressed in / broken as holding down the Shift key while Control Clicking would take your immediately to that tab <comment309761> Can you add a screenshot of the Tab preferences in Safari please?
