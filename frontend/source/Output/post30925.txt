How Can I Use AirPlay Globally for System Sound? <body> Is it possible (and how) to have all the system sound played on AirPlay? Or at least for some specific (random) application (e.g. Songbird)?  <answer30933> What you want is AirFoil by Rogue Amoeba. Plays any audio from your system via AirPlay.  <answer61937> If you have a newer Mac with Mountain Lion you can also use it's built in AirPlay functionality.  Go to System Preferences-Sound and select Apple TV from the Output tab. This will play all system sound from your Mac.  <answer79399> An easy way to do this in Mountain Lion is to hold down the option key and click on the speaker icon in the menu bar. You then get a list of possible outputs, and will be able to send all audio to your Apple TV or other AirPlay device by selecting it.  <comment95329> -1 - why?  It works. <comment241051> This question now has an answer here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/117643/60998. The question is not quite the same, but the accepted answer applies :-)
