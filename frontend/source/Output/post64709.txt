Can RedQuits be made to work with Chrome and OS X? <body> I am used to RedQuits as I like Chrome to behave the same way under different OSes (i.e. closing last window quits application), but I can't make it work on a new iMac with Lion. Others have similar issues with RedQuits and Mountain Lion.  RedQuits seems to work in general, but as soon as I enable "Quit only when 1 window is left for that app" Chrome starts to close last window instead of quitting (as if it has a hidden window somewhere that interfere). Anyone managed to use RedQuits with Chrome &amp; "1 window mode" or maybe there are any alternatives to this app?  <comment76033> The problem only occurs in Chrome I assume? Did you already contact the developer (there's a link on the website)? <comment76035> Yip, seems to be limited to Chrome only. Haven't contacted developer yet, but planning to do it.
