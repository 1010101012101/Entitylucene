Zagg Keyboard (enter key) <body> I have a Zagg Keyboard. For a while it worked fine when I used messenger. I thing the problem came alone when I up dated software. The issues is before the update the enter key moved the cursor down a line. Now the enter key send message. I can't stand this and want it back like it was before. Any ideas???  <answer238529> This behaviour is up to the app/website to decide, so unfortunately you cannot change it back yourself. However, pressing kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd is a common shortcut on Mac and iOS to insert a linebreak when kbdEnter/kbd normally submits.  <comment292608> Shift+Enter works for me too <comment292753> I have tried both ways and it still send text message. Very frustrating. <comment292765> Perhaps report this as a bug in Messenger to Facebook.
