How to switch the primary iCloud account on my iPhone 4? <body> I have recently upgraded an iPhone 4 to iOS 5.1 and when asked i registered it with Account A for both iCloud &amp; iTunes.   However i also use Account A on my iPhone 4S and thus wish to switch the the iCloud account to a brand new Account B (keeping Account A for iTunes as all the apps are purchased on it).  Is this possible? The iCloud screen in settings does not let me change the Apple ID?  <answer47558> ol liOpen the strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong section and find the iCloud account./li liSelect it./li liPress "Delete Account"./li liSelect "Delete"./li liSelect "Add Accountâ€¦"/li liSelect "iCloud"./li liLog in./li /ol  This works on iPad; I assume it's the same for all other current iOS devices.  <answer78972> Yes, but does it delete the account permanently.  The old icloud account is on my other phone that I still want to keep.
