In non-native applications, in the Open File dialog, I can see hidden files but I can't select them <body> I have a problem with some non-native mac software (Perforce Diff and Kdiff3).   When I use the Open File Dialog, I can see the hidden files, but I can not select them or interact with them at all.  In contrast, when using the native Mac TextEdit, when I use the Open File Dialog, I can see and open the hidden files.  hr  This is a screenshot of the Kdiff3 Open File Dialog. I can see the hidden files, but I can not select them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YTZUY.png" alt="I can see hidden files but I can not select them"  hr  OS X version 10.10.3 Yosemite.

In this case option-click still does not allow me to select the files in the File Open Dialog. Right-click allows me to do a Quick Look, but will not allow me to select the files for opening. <comment233096> It works in some software.
