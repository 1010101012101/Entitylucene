Set multiple proxy information for different locations according to which wifi network is connected <body> I hope this is possible.   I have set multiple locations in my MacBook to toggle between various networks and connections.   For home there is no problem, but at work I have an issue. I have a LAN setting which works fine, as everything is routed through our network proxy settings.   However I want to create two different profiles for two WiFi accounts that are available in my office.   I have tried to save them to two different profiles. However when I switch to WiFi, the Mac will automatically pick the network which is higher in the preference order, and it will only seem to select one set of proxies.   Here is an example if this helps.   precodeLAN Network:  Connected via internal company LAN. Inherits default work proxy settings.   Wifi Network 1: Connected via Wifi network.  Manually set proxy 192.8.8.8 for example  Wifi Network 2: Connected via Wifi network Manually set proxy 192.9.9.9 for example  /code/pre  Switching between locations does not seem to toggle the two WiFi settings as far as I can tell.   If possible I would rather handle this inside the Mac without the aid of an app, but I am open to good recommendations.   <comment198974> Hmm, not sure it can be done per wifi setting, but it seems this tool is somewhat lauded: http://www.controlplaneapp.com/
