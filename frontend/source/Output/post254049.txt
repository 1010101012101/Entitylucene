Correcting a bad log-in address <body> After updating to IOS 10.0.1 my I-6 asks me every 20 seconds for an Id verification. My problem is it is asking for the password to a former e-mail address that I had 3 or 4 years ago and I don't remember the password. In settings my phone clearly shows my new e-mail address or log-in and if I try using it then I get told it is the wrong one. I tried clicking the "I forgot" cue but that doesn't help because if they send it to that address, I don't have it anymore and won't get it.  <comment316296> You have no alternative but to find out the password.  https://support.apple.com/HT201354 & https://support.apple.com/HT201455
