What happens if I interrupt image compaction <body> I have a sparse image of hundreds of gigabytes that I run codehidutil compact/codeon now and then. This process takes hours.  I'm just wondering, if I interrupt this process, or if there is a power outage, is there any chance that the image will become corrupted or that I will have data loss?  Or are such data rearrangement programs written with failure in mind, so that any possible loss is minimal?  <comment191984> A power outage should not be a problem if you running on battery, if you interrupt the process normally, no harm done, if you force quit it then yes. <comment192756> Are we talking about corruption of a few files, or could the whole image be corrupted so that all data is lost?
