Do you know a simple sound booster app for Mac? <body> Some videos on websites have the sound volume so low that even with all sound settings at maximum levels it's hard to listen.  I'm looking for an app that would allow me to boost the Mac's volume. Something similar to VLC volume controls.  I already looked at Audio Hijack, but it has way too much features for what I'm looking for. Anything free of charge would be a plus. :)  <answer826> Could you not simply download the movies and play them in VLC or something similar? I'm not aware of anything that'll boost system wide sound, but as you don't seem to have attracted any answers, I'm trying to think of alternatives.  Quicktime can play FLV files, and if you use QT7 Pro, it allows you to boost the sound using the Track Properties pane. Would that be an option for FLV videos?  <answer1066> The application you are looking for is called Hear.  It's pretty expensive though.  I've been looking for a program to do something similar for months, but on the opposite end of the spectrum (my volume to my USB audio adapter is way too high, even with the volume all the way down).  As far as I can tell, there isn't a free program out there that can do this.  You can also try messing around with the built-in Apple utility called "Audio MIDI Setup" (in Applications/Utilities) and creating an aggregate device, then messing with the preamp on this device, but so far I haven't had any success with this.  <answer7087> h1Boom/h1  It works pretty well. I had similar issues on my Mac, didn't like being glued with the headphones forever so I got this just yesterday. And I loved it. It's not free, but for $5 it works like a horse.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7OpE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer88978> If you like to use emiTunes/em to listen / watch your media files... Some time ago I found new easy way to get the sound a bit louder. In emiTunes Library/em select media with low volume and press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdi/kbd. Go to emOptions/em and make emVolume Adjustments/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7pDV7.png" alt="How to boost sound with iTunes"  <answer120570> Hear is a good option and has several different parameters to change and customize.  You can add special effects and adjust the intensity with sliders to suite your own preferences.  There are also predefined sets for specific music genres and wether you are listening via headphones or directly from your computer's speakers.  It gives you a lot of flexibility to change and set the sound to your liking.  <answer163908> Did someone try this?

Real Player is able to download .flv videos. And both RP and QT play them, though I've only been able to adjust sound on RP.  Not very convenient, but indeed an alternative. <comment760> You can adjust the audio on QT Player to using Cmd-J to open properties (I believe this is on QT7 Pro only though, which is free in Snow Leopard). Again, as you said, not massively convenient though. <comment2037> Thanks for your suggestion! Hear, just like Audio Hijack, has way to many features. My sole objective is listening to videos on some news sites. Its price seems adequate to the amount of things you can do with the software, but is indeed expensive for my particular purposes. This is why I'm not accepting the answer. <comment2038> After some experiencing, I'm accepting your answer. Until some simple software is available for boosting sound output on the mac, your suggestion, despite not very convenient, is a viable alternative to the expensive software out there. Thanks! :) <comment9328> It's not bloated with features, the price seems quite OK, and it works just perfectly. Thanks for pointing it out! Changed the accepted answer to this one. (Just let me add a link for easier reference: http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/ ) <comment18841> I'll also chip in that Audio Hijack Pro is so very capable, but Boom is clean, sleek and does exactly what I want for boosting chat and sound that isn't tied directly to the keyboard volume keys / system volume. <comment45231> This will break the system sound after a system crash until the app is launched again. So if your system crashed and you don't get any audio, try launching this. <comment45247> I use Boom. Simple, clean, not buggy. Works for me. <comment147178> 50 **"plus"** points to reinforce the "free of charge" part of the question! <comment147452> I have encountered too videos with sound too low. In these moments, I have the strange feeling of being close to powerful but powerless. <comment147456> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=increase+sound+volume+mac ... Was it really so hard? <comment147518> @XAleXOwnZX — Your search gives me “about 1 280 000 results”. I perfectly understand that David do not examine all of them but rather ask for specialist advice in a site which is made for that. <comment148101> Sadly, there was nothing new after my bounty! :( <comment163622> @NicolasBarbulesco Using the quantity of results to a Google search Query is a TERRIBLE argument against the suggestion to use a Google search to solve such a simple question. <comment177199> Probably not what you're looking for if you're in a Hackintosh. Boom boosted my audio alright, but at the cost of distorting the hell out of it. If this also happens to you, consider using [front panel audio](http://superuser.com/questions/378082/how-to-connect-my-front-audio-panel) which is usually louder. <comment213710> Can you point how it can do the job? <comment289348> Maybe the price has dropped but it is $20 now and I don't really see that as all that expensive for software. <comment299265> Lol, forgive the sarcasm, but doesn't this just perfectly illustrate the Apple market mentality? All I came here looking to do was turn up the volume on my MacBook, and I'm looking at a $5 product. It's kind of unreal when you think about it.
