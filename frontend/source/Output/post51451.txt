iPhone headphones right angle (also might be useful for macbook) <body> So this is a slight design whine, but it is a question.   When I put my headphones into my iPhone the jack sticks straight up and keeps getting caught in things in my pocket and has broken before.  I'd like a headphone extension/adapter that was a right angle so the idea is that there is a adapter that you put into the socket, such that the adapter's socket is 'pointing' at the power button rather than straight up... that way there would be a slight buldge at the top of my case, but the wire would come out of the side and my headphones would be less likely to snap off.    Any ideas?  <answer51492> here ya go - http://bit.ly/JSP2VM  (sorry, couldn't resist!)  <comment58811> http://bit.ly/JSP2VM
