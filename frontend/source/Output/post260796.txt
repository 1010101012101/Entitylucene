Opening an app first time and reopening it - Time Differences MBP <body> A new mac user here. On my 2012 MBP, when I try to open an app which has not been open after a reboot, it takes too much time. After checking the CPU activity I saw that the CPU usage is very low.  When I quit (yes, quit, not close the window), and open the app again, it opens significantly faster and CPU usage is also at peak ( which is ideal and acceptable). I am curious why can't it use the CPU power during the first instance and open apps quicker? Chrome, VLC, Calendar, Contacts, etc all these apps (apple and non apple) take about 15 seconds to open and only a second to reopen.  The only answer I have got till now from a fellow on apple discussions is 'caching' and that HD is slow than SSD. This means that HD should peak at reading speed (as CPU is not a constraint).   Does MacOS work differently than Windows in this matter? On windows I feel that time taken to open the application is somewhat same whenever I open it.  Any guidance on this is appereciated. I am trying to understand how a 2012 MBP can 'feel' slower than my 2009 Dell studio.  <comment326542> Without knowing the specs of your 2009 Dell Studio we can't answer your last question. However, your friend is right, it's due to caching. This is actually relatively normal. The age of the computer is really not an indicator of how fast apps load. I have a late 2008 MBP with a hybrid drive installed and that boots up and launches faster than a 2015 Mac that has a basic hard drive installed. The difference is a even greater with an SSD Installed. Other factors include the amount of physical RAM and how much free space you have left. <comment326624> Thanks for replying. My Studio had a 7200 RPM drive, a Studio 1558. What I am trying to say is, though there is enough CPU power left, only half the memory being used, then why is the HDD read speed not near the peak? Does windows OS and MacOS behave differently while opening applications?
