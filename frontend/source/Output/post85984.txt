Where does MplayerX keep its playback history? <body> MplayerX, not only remembers what I've watched but also is able to resume playback at a later invocation.  For example, if I watch media-file abc.m4v for 4 minutes and then quit the program.  Then start MplayerX at a later date and open abc.m4v, it starts playback at 4 minutes.  I'd like to know where it stores the playback history.  I'd also like to know if I can retrieve that information.  Thanks!   <answer86006> MPlayerX saves playback positions in plist file code~/Library/Application Support/MPlayerX/bookmarks.plist/code  <comment99246> Thank you for this!  Do you know what the values stand for.  I see things likekey file://localhost/abc.m4v /keystring33.795867/string What does 33.795867 stand for?
