OSX Mavericks crashes every 2 days <body> I have 10.9.1. When I was on 10.9.0 my uptime was 26 days, than the .1 update came.   Now my macbook (2012 rmbp 15) freezes every 2 days on average. The symptoms are similar to Xorg crash due to bad drivers in Linux, the screen just freezes up completely (sometimes mouse works for few seconds, than freezes too). Its like that until hard reboot.  What is the best way to figure out why is that? Any logs to look at?
