Installing tmux but getting "dyld: Library not loaded Referenced from: /usr/" <body> I try to do  precodebrew install tmux /code/pre  it installs, but, probably due to previous failed and not fully removed non-brew attempts to install both it and libevent, when try to use tmux I get  precode$ tmux dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libevent-2.0.5.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/tmux   Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  I tried to install libevent but I got:  precode$ brew install libevent Warning: libevent-2.0.21 already installed, it's just not linked /code/pre  so I tried  precode$ brew link libevent /code/pre  but I got  precodeLinking /usr/local/Cellar/libevent/2.0.21...  Warning: Could not link libevent. Unlinking... Error: Could not symlink file: /usr/local/Cellar/libevent/2.0.21/include/event2/util.h Target /usr/local/include/event2/util.h already exists. You may need to delete it. To force the link and overwrite all other conflicting files, do:   brew link --overwrite formula_name To list all files that would be deleted:   brew link --overwrite --dry-run formula_name /code/pre  so I tried  precode$ brew link --overwrite libevent /code/pre  but I got  precodeLinking /usr/local/Cellar/libevent/2.0.21...  Warning: Could not link libevent. Unlinking... Error: Permission denied - /usr/local/include/event2/util.h /code/pre  so I tried  precode$ sudo brew link --overwrite libevent /code/pre  Password:  but I got  precodeError: Cowardly refusing to `sudo brew link` You can use brew with sudo, but only if the brew executable is owned by root. However, this is both not recommended and completely unsupported so do so at your own risk. /code/pre  I'm stuck.  <answer127189> The answer was  precode brew install pkg-config  rm configure  sh autogen.sh   ./configure   make  make install /code/pre  Also see http://whiletruecode.com/post/installing-iterm2-and-tmux-osxbr but do the above instead of the broken link at the last step.  <answer127413> Mine had the same problem.  precode$ tmux dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libevent-2.0.5.dylib Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/tmux/1.9a/bin/tmux Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  Tried to install codelibevent/code but it was already there, not linked yet:  precode$ brew install libevent Warning: libevent-2.0.21 already installed $ brew link libevent Warning: Already linked: /usr/local/Cellar/libevent/2.0.21 To relink: brew unlink libevent &amp;&amp; brew link libevent /code/pre  I solved it by doing exactly what was suggested above:  precode$ brew unlink libevent &amp;&amp; brew link libevent Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/libevent/2.0.21... 4 links removed Linking /usr/local/Cellar/libevent/2.0.21... 25 symlinks created $ tmux -V tmux 1.9a /code/pre  <answer273139> I tried the above steps but those did not work for me though. In my case I just did not have the missing version of libevent. I double, triple checked it but it seems that version isn't served by brew or someway.  What I did have is libevent-2.1.6.dylib. I made a symlink from libevent-2.0.5.dylib to the aforementioned file and tmux seems to work again. Perhaps tmux should be updated?  <answer274218> precodebrew uninstall --force tmux brew install tmux /code/pre  fixed it for me.  <answer294770> My tmux also started shooting this error recently. In my case simply calling codebrew upgrade tmux/code helped.  <comment153335> this did it! thanks! <comment154717> This worked for me too. Thank you. <comment343337> Welcome to Ask Different!

I had the exact same error message and symptoms. My problem, however, wasn't the badly linked libevent but just the a whole different version.  My addition could help other people having the same issue i had. <comment357669> This worked for me, but without the need of `--force`. <comment362683> That didn't work for me. I had to uninstall and reinstall. <comment370688> Accepted answer didn't work in my case, but this did. Thanks
