Install OS X on clean HD without internet recovery or external HD <body> I have a Mid 2009 MacBook Pro 15" with El Capitan installed (the latest OS that can be installed on this machine). strongI am about to replace the HD/strong. I don't think this machine can do an internet recovery, and the only CD I have is Tiger (10.4). strongWhat is the best way to install El Capitan?/strong   Is it going to be possible to upgrade all the way from Tiger to El Capitan? If so, how? Can I download Snow Leopard and then use the App Store from there, or do I need a CD?   Or is the only option to buy an external HD enclosure and use my old HD to recover? (I am hoping there is an alternative, because I don't have the time to order one, and I was hoping I didn't need to spend that money).  <comment334405> MBPs mid 2009 require 10.5.7 (Leopard) and your old Tigerrroarr CDs won't help at all. You either need an external enclosure or a Genius bar nearby! <comment334412> @klanomath ouch. I didn't think there would be a minimum OS requirement. Ok, thanks. <comment334440> Just out of curiosity, why not download and create a USB installer before you replace the HDD?
