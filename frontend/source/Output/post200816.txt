Tilde shortcut duplicates my key <body> When writing, I often need to use tildes like ó (but still need my keyboard to be in English), so I just hold the key down and press 4:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4yG0N.png" alt="enter image description here"  Usually it works fine. But several times have I ended up with this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cUFjW.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't know. It's like some sort of lag happens and the keystroke is repeated or something.  This is not software specific: it has happened to me in all sorts of applications with textfields. Even web browsers.  Is this a known problem? Is there a solution?  I am using Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.3. I have a Macbook Pro 15" Retina Display Mid 2014. I don't use other Macs so I can't say I can reproduce this issue in them. I use the builtin keyboard.  <answer200825> I didn’t know that holding a key in OS X produced a list like that. Very useful!  Not a direct answer to your question, but may help you, is that if you type kbdalt/kbd+kbde/kbd then kbdo/kbd you will end up the the “ó” character.   The kbdalt/kbd+kbde/kbd combination gives you the acute diacritic mark, then you just enter the letter you want to put under it. So kbdalt/kbd+kbde/kbd then kbde/kbd works to get “é” too.   You can also do kbdalt/kbd+kbde/kbd then kbdshift/kbd+kbdo/kbd to get “Ó”.   <comment242073> See also this related question: [Is it possible to type in macron (e.g. “ā”) without using U.S. Extended Keyboard?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/200063/120171)
