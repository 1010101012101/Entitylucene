Audio noise hen connecting macbook pro to ext monitor <body> I was wondering if anyone could help me analyse where to start in trying to eliminate an AC noise issue. Like described years ago in this thread, I get a static noise in my stereo when connecting an external monitor to my rMBP 2015. Details: External soundcard RME babyface Pro connected directly to the laptop. Monitor is HP 5K, it takes both DP ports to run 5K whereas it can run 4K on just one cable. Noise is the same in both scenarios. I have tried different cables, different sockets, different combinations of sockets, different outputs on my soundcard, different inputs on my Amp. All gives the same result. It makes no difference if the laptop is plugged into AC or not. I have no grounded sockets in my flat, so that is not a viable route.  I am considering investing in some power rails, but I am not sure if it will solve anything. The problem is not there when I use my Thinkpad W530 instead of my Macbook.  I bought the external monitor to use in my home recording studio, so I really need to find a fix for it. I have tried other monitors as well, same problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated :) Thanks Rune
