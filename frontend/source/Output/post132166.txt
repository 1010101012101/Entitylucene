Show hidden files in SELECT folder only <body> How do I show hidden files in one directory only? I have a development folder that I'd like to see hidden files in, but I don't want to see hidden files anywhere else on my computer.  Here is the code I tried in the terminal to show all hidden files but it's not what I want. Thanks!  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  <answer132167> strongThis isn't possible./strong You can either show all hidden files or hide all hidden files. This setting can't be set for individual folders.  supSee this Super User question regarding .htaccess/sup  <comment155345> If these aren't dotfiles then you can just use `chmod nohidden`. If there's a specific dotfile you want you can make a symlink or alias. But there's no way to do this like you can in Windows.
