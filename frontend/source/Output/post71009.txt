How to add smbutil as a lookup mechanism for hostnames <body> There are a bunch of computers on my network that are not on the DNS server. They broadcast their name using Samba or are Windows Workgroup machines.  When I run either ping or try to access them over the browser, it does not work.  However I am able to do a codesmbutil lookup thathost/code and get their ip address.  What should I do to get Mountain Lion to add smbutil as a mechanism to resolve hostnames when other mechanisms, i.e. codeDNS/code, codeBonjour/code, code/etc/hosts/code fail?
