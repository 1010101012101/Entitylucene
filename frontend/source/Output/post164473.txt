Adobe Flash Player.app file alone, without being embedded into a .dmg package <body> where can I download the Adobe Flash Player.app file NOT as a .dmg Installer package to put into the Applications folder. I have done so with other files, but cannot seem to find the executable Flash Player file to put into the Applications folder.br I just want the .app file.    <answer164474> Adobe provides a standalone Flash Player: Flash Player Projector 16.0. Additional also debugger versions are available as well as older versions.   Originally it was meant for Flex and Flash developers.

I'm simply looking for the Adobe Flash Player.app file without the .dmg Installer package. <comment192830> it just installs the Adobe Flash Player.app and not anything else (like the plug-in)! <comment192832> yeah, I'd like to install the Adobe Flash Player.app file myself.  There is something wrong with my computer and .dmg files, so I can usually just grab whatever .app file I need or update and place it right into the Applications folder in the Mac HD.  It's worked just fine with other programs so far. <comment192835> you might treat the causes instead of symptoms by rather asking a question regarding your dmg/installer packages problems... <comment192837> ok.  how do I extract the .app file from the installer package without running the installer program?  or rather, can I hack the package and pull the .app file out? <comment192838> you may download and install [Pacifist](https://www.charlessoft.com/cgi-bin/pacifist_download.cgi?type=zip) (it's a zip file!) and try to install the package with it. <comment192839> great!   thank you for your time :) <comment192841> it's shareware but afaik the first 14 days you are free to use it
