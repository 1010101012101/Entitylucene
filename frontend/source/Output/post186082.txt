Drag and drop from Photos.app to Photoshop <body> I can't seem to drag-and-drop photos from the Photos application into Photoshop, I could do this with iPhoto... How do I edit them in Photoshop?  <answer186226> Drag and drop does not seem to be possible. You can export the original to your desktop and then open with photoshop or another app.   How to export to desktop.  <comment219805> but... why? this should be any easy fix for the app. i don't want to wast space on duplicate images :( <comment219810> I agree. Simple to implement but not sure why apple decided not to.
