Java 6 doesn't work on OS 10.6.8 <body> i don't understand and need some help: java doesn't work anymore for a few months and i don't know why.  I have installed the latest version from apple, actually the 1.6.0_45-b06-451 on my imac 21,5" of middle 2010 and after checking the security system option and enabled the firefox plugin, i tried in safari and Chrome. Also tried with 32 and 64 bits kernel...  Finally i checked the XProtect.meta.plist to see the version limit allowed. When i check on java.com it seem disabled or not installed, but on other sites it worked fine, like here (or javatester.org for examples)  What can i do for use without issues like i did before ? Thanks a lot for any help...  <answer123137> If you install OSX Mavericks via the app store, Java will stay up to date &amp; working.  <comment143780> For information, my 1st ligne "hello everybody" disappeared even after trying editing... <comment143782> Thank you for answering so fast ! But i can't download it for the moment, very bad connexion. I also need to keep my Snow Leopard for software's compatibilities (and a little afraid of the ressources needed) <comment143786> Welcome to AskDifferent!
