Is there a list somewhere of all the special characters I can type using the option key? <body> OS X lets me type special characters directly on the keyboard by holding the kbdOption/kbd. For example: — is an em dash, “ and ” are curvy quotes, etc.  Is there a good cheat sheet listing all these keys somewhere? I tend to find myself holding kbdoption/kbd and running my hands up and down the keyboard looking for a specific character.   <answer2796> Apple moved things around. Starting with MacOS X 10.9 Mavericks you must go the the "Keyboard" preference pane, then to "Input Sources" and there you can activate "Show Input menu in menu bar".  hr  original answer from 2010-10-01:  In the preference pane "International" under "Input Menu" activate "Character Palette" and "Keyboard Viewer".  You will then have access to the "Keyboard Viewer" in the menu bar.  <answer4639> In the "Input menu" in the menu bar (to switch on codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Language and Text -&gt; Show Input method in menu bar./code. Make sure codeKeyboard and Character Viewer/code in codeSelect Input Methods to use/code is selected)  ol liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5PoDC.png" alt="Enable"/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xApBn.png" alt="Where to find"/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HwNPy.png" alt="without alt"/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rol5g.png" alt="with alt"/li /ol  And you have your cheat sheet.  <answer121294> There is indeed some software which will help you remind shortcuts.br You will find a list of official shorcuts here at apple.com.  To learn shortcuts, I find Eve the most appealing. Everytime you are using your mouse to execute a command or action, Eve will remind you of the shortcut which you can use for the next time. Eve supports Mavericks, Lion and Mountain Lion.  Their are two more apps which are approaching an another attempt: CheatSheet and KeyCue.br They are giving you an instant overview of all shortcuts. Hold the kbdcmd/kbd key for a couple of seconds, and a window will pop up with a cheat sheet. While CheatSheet is free, KeyCue costs $19.99     <comment141354> seconding Eve, it works well. CheatSheet is also a solid recommendation. <comment141374> http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343 or http://kbcovers.com/os-x-shortcuts-keyboard-cover/ <comment141383> I would recommend CheatSheet as well. <comment181313> Does not exist in 10.10. <comment181799> @jameshfisher that is unfortunate. Is there an alternate way to access it? <comment274974> It does exist, it's just moved. System Preferences  Keyboard  Input Sources. Specify showing the character viewer in the first tab (Keyboard  Keyboard). <comment274981> Do any of these have anything to do with Special Characters?  The question is about that, not about shortcuts for menu actions. <comment275003> @AndrewU.  Neither of those seems to have anything to do with Special Charcters, just menu shortcuts. <comment275007> @TomGewecke The original question is in the sidebar on the right under "linked":http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/121289/is-there-any-mac-os-x-software-i-could-use-to-learn-keyboard-shortcuts?lq=1 I think the duplicate merge was a wrong decision. <comment275017> @napcae  Thanks!  I have flagged both questions and recommended this answer be moved back where it belongs.
