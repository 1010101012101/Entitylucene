Enabling Java 7 on Mountain Lion <body> The first time I tried to use Java on Mountain Lion, it installed automatically. Unfortunately, it installed Java 6, so I installed Java 7. If I navigate to Java in System Preferences, only Java 7 is listed. How do I switch to Java 7, or remove Java 6?  <answer58118> To switch to Java 7 for when Java is run from the terminal, I added the following line to code~/.profile/code:  precodeexport JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_06.jdk/Contents/Home /code/pre  <answer60880> Apple's tools don't see Java 7, Oracle's tools don't see Java 6; it's all a bit ugly. Luckily there's an ugly fix to go with it!  Normal Mac Java 6 running on 10.8:  precodejava -version java version "1.6.0_33" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_33-b03-424-11M3720) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.8-b03-424, mixed mode) /code/pre  Install the Java 7 JDK (not just the JRE) from Oracle.  Move the system java out of the way (so you can get it back if you want):  precodesudo mv /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdkx /code/pre  Then symlink 7 in place of 6:  precodesudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_06.jdk /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk /code/pre  and voila:  precodejava -version java version "1.7.0_06" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_06-b24) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.2-b09, mixed mode) /code/pre  I've not had trouble with any java apps so far (apart from java preferences which checks which java it's running under).  There's probably a better way of doing this, but it works for me.  <answer74840> $ cp -r /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_12.jdk /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/  $ sudo ln -sF /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_12.jdk CurrentJDK  $ java -version java version "1.7.0_12-ea" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_12-ea-b05) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.0-b26, mixed mode)  <comment72969> I found that I had to open Java Preferences after doing this and drag java7 to the top of the the preferred order dialog which was presented, otherwise java6 was still used
