This Bash Reference Manual page explains all the various Bash script files that get executed upon starting up a Bash shell.   p.s. Keep in mind that any one of those files could include commands to load/execute yet another file.  <comment83917> Do they appear in each new tab you create in Terminal? Do you have installed any software (or done any other changes) lately? <comment83975> Yes it does, it appears in every new tab. Lately I installed ipython, ipython notebook and created a virtual machine deleting the existing one. <comment83976> Well, one of the installs messed up your .bashrc/.alias/.profile <comment83980> Heres what I have in my bash profile: <comment83981> Heres what I have in my bash profile:  export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.0.2/bin:$PATH # SublimeText export SUBLIME_HOME="/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app" export PATH=$PATH:$SUBLIME_HOME/Contents/SharedSupport/bin # MySQL export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql-5.5.20-osx10.6-x86_64/bin #source ~/.git-completion.bash <comment84028> Can you do `mv ~/.bash_profile ~/bash_profile`, then open a new tab to see if the problem still occurs? Afterwards (irregardless of whether it occurs) do `mv ~/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile` to reverse. <comment84088> By doing the first step (mv ~/.bash_profile ~/bash_profile), the declare -x messages doesn't occur. But then non of my alias works. Then I did the second step (mv ~/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile) and the messages come again. <comment84089> Can you please add the content of your .alias file to the question (you can edit the question text yourself) and also verify that the .bash_profile I pasted yesterday is correct? The lines you posted don't create any aliases so we are probably missing something. <comment84124> Did you mean all the alias I have in my ~/bash_profile? I don't know what you mean by .alias file. <comment84128> The whole .bash_profile then. Something in there is causing the declare commands to appear in the output. There is no way to identify the problem without access to the whole file. <comment84150> Added my whole bash_profile <comment84173> Delete the second alias definition for reload (which is syntactically wrong anyway) and try again. If this doesn't solve the issue, put a # in front of the last line (git completion) and try again. <comment84203> Did all the steps. Still getting the messages. <comment84214> Comment out the first line then, maybe your PATH contains blanks before .bash_profile is even read. Then open a new tab again. <comment84229> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6502/discussion-between-patrix-and-user35124) <comment84264> commenting out the first line didn't make any change. <comment84313> Got rid of it. There was a blank space in my export path in first line. Thanks for being there with me and helping all the way. <comment263720> Reshad, I recommend you add this as an answer, so people will notice.  This effected me in the same way, I had newlines after some export statements, and it caused the output issues.
