iPod nano 4th generation not recognised but iPhone SE is <body> I have an iPod nano 4th gen that charges when I plug it into my laptop but isn't recognised by windows or itunes. But when I plug in my iPhone SE, that is recognised by both.  I've tried absolutely everything: reinstalling itunes, checking for updates, updating my usb controllers, stopping and starting apple mobile device support, restarting my laptop- nothing works.  It seems that when my iPhone is plugged in, the apple mobile device support appears under the usb controllers, but as soon as my older iPod is plugged in it disappears and nothing I do works.   This is super frustrating- any help would be really appreciated!  Thanks
