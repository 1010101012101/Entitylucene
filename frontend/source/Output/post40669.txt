Is there an iPhone application that can play music from arbitrary shoutcast server? <body> I know of private shoutcast servers that transmit music and I would like to hear from my iPhone on the go  <answer40671> I am not sure if the official SHOUTcast app lets you add private servers, but worth a try.  FStream is one of the best radio streamers and looking online, looks like it can open Shoutcast streams. I have used it for some other streams from local radio stations and a few other streaming sites and really liked it.  Finally, there is an app called Tuner Internet Radio that looks like it can open Shoutcast streams too.   <answer52921> TuneIn Radio will let you add custom URLs (including ShoutCast server URLs) to your bookmarks list and stream from them. It will also keep your playlists in sync across multiple devices, record streams for, find local streams using your current location and more. You but it the app store. And when you're at your Mac, you can use their browser-based desktop app to keep listening and access your bookmarks.  To add a ShoutCast server as a custom URL use:  precodeipaddress:port/stream/x/ /code/pre  Where:  ul licodeipaddress/code is the IP or host name of the machine hosting the ShoutCast server/li licodeport/code is the port where ShoutCast is broadcasting on the server/li licodestream/code is the name of the stream from ShoutCast/li licodex/code is the number of the stream/li /ul  Once you add the custom stream to your bookmarks it should be available from any TuneIn Radio application or their web app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yP1gq.jpg" alt="Adding a custom stream to your TuneIn Radio bookmarks"  <answer114959> I really like the app strongInternet Radio Box/strong â€” it's $0.99, but it really worth!br I have many Shoutcast stations saved on it, and it also shows the album art!  <answer292639> I might be bit late to answer this question. All the apps mentioned above are good but my best personal experience is with Jukebox Shoutcast. Which is really good and simple. Does the job nicely. But it is not for free it costs $2.99.  <comment369271> Please disclose your personal affiliation with that app. It would be helpful if you could explain why this app is better than the others mentioned, especially if it costs money.
