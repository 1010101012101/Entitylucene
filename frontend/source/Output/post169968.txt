iPod Touch 1st Gen charging rebooting loop <body> I have a 1st Generation iPod touch.  When I try to charge it, it goes into a loop:  ol liThe very low battery logo displays /li liThe black screen with white apple logo is displayed /li liThe screen shuts down  /li liAnd repeat../li /ol  Is the battery totally knackered, or is there anything else I could try?  <answer169969> This loop only happened when plugged into my MacBook Pro. When I plugged into a mains charger, it successfully booted to the OS... Weird.
