Set up Gmail to work properly with Apple Mail <body> ol liI often can't find my sent mail in my Gmail account viewed on my Mac in Apple Mail. I did not set up these folders, but I have both a "Sent Mail" folder indented under a "Gmail" folder and a "Sent Messages (gmail [accountname])" folder in my Gmail account in Apple Mail. Sometimes a sent messages shows up in neither of those, but I can find it by searching for it./li liSome incoming messages do not appear in my Inbox, but are in a box I did not set up labeled "Important."/li /ol  How do I set the Gmail settings and filters to avoid these two problems?  <answer26412> Are you using POP or IMAP?  Google GMail has help documents for that that.  POP configuration  IMAP configuration  <answer26423> Besides Google's "official" guide to configure GMail with a desktop client (see Wheat Williams' answer) I think this guide is pretty good and helpful:  http://www.macworld.com/article/157846/2011/03/mailgmail.html  It' a detailed step-by-step guide an features several screenshots.  Regarding the sent messages (your first point):     "Select the [Gmail] - Sent Mail subfolder and choose Mailbox - Use This Mailbox For - Sent"   <comment37203> I have been looking for something like this for very long, thank you. <comment75739> The correct link is http://www.macworld.com/article/1157846/mailgmail.html <comment75741> Please just edit the question - everyone can edit things and should when they can correct something or make an answer better.
