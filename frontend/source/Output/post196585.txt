Yosemite Photos can't delete photos from iPhone <body> I just updated my mac to the new Photos and I imported some images from my iPhone 6. My question is rather simple. Why I can't delete the imported images in my iPhone from Photos??? I was able to do that in the old iPhotos.  Running on version: 1.0.1 (215.65.0)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Hqi4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer196588> In Photos you have an option to "delete items after import" near the imports buttons, in the top right corner  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wBIB5.png" alt="enter image description here"  In Photos on the other corner I have "Open photos from this device checked"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zBUIw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Try to keep up to date Yosemite, Itunes and Photos. Also in Itunes when you connect your apple device in the Photos settings uncheck "Sync Photos"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KoagM.png" alt="enter image description here"  After you have done all this. Restart your computer. and try again.  <comment234860> That is really strange... My Photos doesn't have that!!
