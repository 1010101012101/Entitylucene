Removing Spotlight <body> Is it possible to remove spotlight from the menu bar? I have too many menu bar items running all the time and I'm trying to remove what I can to see everything regardless of what app is open.   <answer83463> You can do this by running a command in the terminal: codesudo chmod 600 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search/code.  Then logout and back in.  Source.
