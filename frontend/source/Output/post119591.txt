How to restore operating system on iMac (Late 2006)? <body> I got a keyboard for it, but it's not paired and apparently won't because there is no version of OS X found.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1JZU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have the DVD containing OS X but can't eject a disc already in it because of the keyboard issue.  <comment139480> I think the simplest answer is to grab a keyboard that doesn't require BT (USB) and connect it for now while you reload the operating system. <comment139498> Try force eject disk methods, found on google.com
