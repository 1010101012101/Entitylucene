Remove iTunes and Mac App store results when looking for a word <body> I would like to know whether it is possible to remove the emItunes Store/em and emMac App Store/em results from the word look-up functionality in El Capitan 10.11.1, illustrated below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nkxyZ.png" alt="iTunes Store"  and App Store:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6eWMA.png" alt="App Store"  I find the attached look-up results pointless and irrelevant.  <answer214884> As you can see here, you can disable some "Search results" from emSpotlight/em or emLook up/em. You can also uncheck the option "Allow Spotlight Suggestions in Spotlight Look up", to prevent Look up to work as Spotlight does.  This link can also be useful (it refers to Yosemite but the same functionalities are available for El Capitan too).
