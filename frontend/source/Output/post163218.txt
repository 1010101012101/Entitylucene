Use Kaleidoscope as external merge tool in Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA <body> In addition to this question I would also like to use Kaleidoscope as the external merge tool in Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA. Under emPreferences\External Diff Tools/em I've checked emUse external merge tool/em and set emPath to executable/em to code/usr/local/bin/ksdiff/code and emparameters/em to code--merge --base %2 --output %4 -- %1 --snapshot %3 --snapshot/code. The parameters passed to the command line argument from Android Studio are:  ul licode%1/code - left (Local changes)/li licode%2/code - base (current version without local changes)/li licode%3/code - right (Server content)/li licode%4/code - output path/li /ul  Kaleidoscope opens when I click emMerge/em of Android Studio's merge conflict popup but when I solve the conflicts in Kaleidoscope, save the file and close the window, Android Studio doesn't register that the file has been changed/resolved and still displays the popup. I've also tried to close Kaleidoscope with kbdCmd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd but the behaviour didn't change.  Kaleidoscope version: 2.1.0br Android Studio version: 1.0.2
