How to change Time Machine settings of a partly broken OS (e.g. by manipulating configuration files) <body> I have a broken Mac OS 10.6.8 here.   ul liStartup is normal, login works, but most programs can't be started/li liRepair of OS with install disks fails/li liBackup via Time Machine is working/li liSystem Settings cannot be accessed/li /ul  So I have a working backup and want to erase the harddisk to make an installation of 10.7 possible. The problem is, that the backup does not incorporate all files and folders I need. This is due to the settings excluding some folders. Is there a way to change the excluded folders manually?  I'm fine with a hint where to find the configuration files for Time Machine, so I can change them with an appropriate Editor.  <answer214638> The folders or paths excluded from the Time Machine backup are stored in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist  To include them again modify the file with an editor (TextEditor will strongnot/strong work) or codesudo nano /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code and remove all entries in the SkipPaths array. In the example below you'd have to remove line 19 to include the (excluded) /Applications folder again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c49K7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You then probably have to restart the backup daemon.  If you don't have access to Terminal or an appropriate editor, copy the files and folders manually with the Finder to the backup volume and copy them back after installing the new operating system.  <comment259218> That's exactly what I've been looking for. It works fine. Thanks! (I used vim to edit, but this won't make any difference).
