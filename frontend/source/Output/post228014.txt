Apps crash when EarPods are unplugged? <body> There is this strange thing happening to my MacBook Pro, whenever I try to unplug the headphones (Apple Earpods) with some the apps running in the background including Xcode, Postman, AirMail, Chrome, Terminal, iTunes, and Messages, all of them crash, and today I was thrown out of my workspace and asked to log in again. When I looked in the log I found this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCPGl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  My computer specs:   MacBook Pro 13-inch mid-2014 with El Capitan 10.11.3
