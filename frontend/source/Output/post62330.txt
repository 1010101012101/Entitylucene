How does Mac OS X 10.7 detect different displays? <body> I have a Macbook Pro with Mac OS X 10.7, and an external display screen attached to my Macbook, which is working fine.br Sometimes, I have to switch the second display to a projector (because I want to give a presentation).  Those settings (e.g. arrangement, resolution) are different from my external display screen. In 90% of the cases, Mac OS X knows which arrangement/resolution I want, depending on the type of external screen; in 10% of the cases, it's mixing up the configurations and I have to manually edit the configuration again.  Can I see somewhere what configuration is attached to a certain display?br Why does Mac OS X mix the configuration settings between my external display screen and my projector?  <answer62350> 1) You should be able to see these configurations in System Preferences  Display. I believe you go to to Layout (or could be called mirroring).  2) OS X displays two Display panels so you know which panel is attached to which screen.  If the Display options don't allow you to pick a resolution, change the Resolution from "Best for XX display", that will allow you to pick a supported, lower, resolution.  <answer189781> You might want to investigate a third-party solution.  I would try SwitchResX (Macupdate link) as it claims to be able to save the resolution better than OS X can on it's own.  I do not own this software.  <comment72276> 1) I can see the current configuration, but not other configurations (when I attach my external LCD screen, I cannot see the configuration of my projector) 2) yes, but it's showing an incorrect display <comment72282> So the additional panel says something along the lines of Generic LCD? <comment73484> @ squarefrog: what do you mean with your last question? <comment73591> In the additional display config panel, it should say the name of the display at the top. I'm asking if it says Generic LCD or something similar? <comment73618> @ squarefrog: it was saying the name of the projector, but it should have said the name of my LCD screen <comment73631> OK So it looks like it doesn't recognise your new LCD screen. In that case what you'd want to do is try and force OS X to discover the change in screens. In Display preferences do you have a button that states Detect Displays? <comment73862> @ squarefrog: yes, I have this button. I will try it, next time I have the issue <comment169890> Look in the ColorSync Utility.app in your Utility folder, there the profiles for the displays are saved, and it shows which one is used for what. <comment252650> It depends. More details are really needed regarding your device. Some models simply have more than one GPU. <comment279317> Is the external display on when you connect it?
