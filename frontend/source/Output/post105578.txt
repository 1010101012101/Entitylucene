The "Where is my son" features - am I doing it wrong? <body> On the Siri help screen, one of the things you can say is "Where is my son".  Now my thinking was that it does a "Find my iPhone" lookup to see where he is (since he also has an iphone).    But everytime I tried to say this, Siri asks me the name of my child, then it asks whether I want it to remember that he is my son.  I say yes and then it presents his address card.  It does this strongevery time/strong I ask it.  What am I missing here?  <comment124128> Do you mean "Find My Friends", not "Find My iPhone"? e.g. http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/01/17/use-siri-to-find-friends/ <comment124131> You might have just taught siri that your son is called "where". <comment124133> @zigg Either feature would do the trick.  But I an't make it work <comment124139> Do you have Find my Friends installed?  Both you and your son will need to log into it, and your son will need to friend you and grant your visibility.
