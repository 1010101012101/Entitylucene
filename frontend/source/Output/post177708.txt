Wine install from source while keeping brew installed version <body> I have wine 1.6.2 installed currently through brew running Yosemite 10.10.2. I would like to simultaneously have an older version of wine on my machine to run a program that does not work with newer versions of wine. The version of wine I need is not available through codebrew versions wine/code so I will need to build from source if possible. I need to try with a number of versions of wine from before version 1.2. Can this be done and how do I make both versions of wine available and prevent naming conflicts etc. ?  <comment210315> When asking questions such as this it might be helpful if you include both the OS X version you're using and what version of Wine you're wanting to install. <comment210339> The latest OS X version that supports Wine 1.2 is Leopard. <comment210423> @user3439894 Thanks for the info. This is gonna be interesting :)
