Why have my posted events disappeared from my calendar iOS 8.3 <body> My events that were scheduled are not visible any longer. I can't add events any longer either. The Add button is active, not ghosted as I read in other question.   <comment215383> Please provide some more details: What device are you? Are you using the native Calendar app, or a 3rd part one? Have ALL past events disappeared, or the case is that you can't add newer ones? What happens when you tap the "Add" button? How quickly does the dot/event disappear after adding? <comment215386> Do you have any Calendars hidden? Tap Calendars at the bottom of the month view page
