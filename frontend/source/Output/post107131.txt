Booting problem after Mavericks installation: BootCache.playlist: 2 No such file or directory <body> I have updated my MacBook Air 2011 from the App Store to Mavericks but after the installation it doesn't boot up (spinning grey ball). Safemode or a new installation didn't help and verbose mode ends on      "bootcachecontrol: unable to open /var/db/bootcache.playlist: 2 no such file or directory"   I tried   precodebootcachecontrol -f /var/db/bootcache.playlist generate /dev/rdisk0s2 /code/pre  in single user mode but that returned me a     bootcachecontrol: unable to determine uuid for volume /dev/rdisk0s2   message. Every time I want to access diskutil it ends with     Killed: 9   How can I fix it?
