SSH access using .pub key <body> I don't know if I'm overthinking this too much but I can't seem to understand how to use a ssh public key to create an ssh connection trough my mac.    I'll list my steps bellow:    ol liFirst created the SSH keys in my server in cpanel - SSH keys and created a key pair with name codeid_rsatest/code  /li liThen I downloaded to my mac both public and private key files, so now in my downloads folder I have the files: codeid_rsatest/code and codeid_rsatest.pub/code  /li liThen I moved the codeid_rsatest.pub/code file to codeUsers/myuser/.ssh//code and opened Terminal.app - Shell - New Remote Connection and entered the information below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5TDDe.png" alt="enter image description here"  and receive this error:  precodessh: connect to host example.com port 22: Operation timed out [Process completed] /code/pre/li /ol  What am I doing wrong? Is this even the way on how to create a SSH access with SSH keys?    <answer224539> You got it the wrong way round :-)  ul licreate a key pair on the Mac you are using /li liput both codeid_rsa.pub/code and codeid_rsa/code into code~/.ssh/code and run codechmod 600 id_rsa/code/li liappend the generated public key (codeid_rsa.pub/code) to code.ssh/authorized_keys/code on the remote machine (your server in this case). If you are allowed to login in via codessh/code using a password, use  precodessh remoteuser@remotemachine "mkdir ~/.ssh; cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /code/pre  otherwise transfer the file by whatever means you have to upload files./li lirun codessh remoteuser@remotemachine/code in your shell to connect/li /ul  PS: strongThe private key should never need to leave the machine it's generated on/strong  <comment272323> `Operation timed out` sounds like network problem. Can you ping the host?
