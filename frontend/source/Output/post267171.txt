How do I set the name by which an Apple Watch addresses me? <body> I prefer to go by a nickname, and I have my iPhone set to address me by that name (from Siri et al). However, my Apple Watch's Activity notifications all address me by my first name as provided on my address card - and it seems to always use the one that it has pulled from Facebook, of all the places, rather than the one on my iCloud address card.  I do not want to change my name on Facebook nor do I want to disconnect my Facebook account, but I'd rather my Apple Watch refer to me by my preferred nickname.  Is there some hidden setting I am not finding? I know the iPhone uses the nickname field on my address card (which is what Siri changes if you ask to be called something else) but WatchOS doesn't seem to use that, or at least not consistently. (Apple Watch Siri does use my nickname, for what it's worth.)  <comment336130> For now I have simply unlinked my Facebook contact from my iCloud contact, and that seems to be working okay.
