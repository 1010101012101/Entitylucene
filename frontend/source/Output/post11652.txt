How do I delete just the videos from my iPhone? <body> So I'm running out of space on my iPhone (iOS 4.3) and the quickest thing to do is delete the videos that are already backed up in iPhoto.  How can I do this quickly? That is, without scanning through the 4000+ items in my Camera Roll and looking for the video icons.  strongEdit:/strong Just to clarify, I'm not looking to delete emall/em the videos, just enough to free up some space.  <answer11654> You can in iTunes on the Photos tab de-select "Include videos" - then all videos on your iPhone will be deleted - when you do a sync.  Otherwise you need to manually delete the videos one by one from your iPhone.   <answer11661> If I'm understanding your question correctly, you want to delete individual videos from the iPhone and but not in iTunes. I use a program called iPhone Explorer (PC or MAC). Once installed, connect the iPhone to computer and iPhone Explorer should find it. Drill down to &lt;100APPLE. That is where I find the videos listed. Good luck.  <answer11685> Sorry for the self-answer, but I found a way to do it quickly using just the iPhone and no third-party software.  In iOS 4.3, do the following:  ol liOpen Camera.app/li liClick the photo thumbnail to view the photo library/li liClick Camera Roll to view all photos/li liThere's a capsule button at the top that says 'All|Photos|Videos'. Select videos/li liPress the Export icon - you can now tap on videos to select them before hitting Delete./li /ol  Not sure why this functionality is not available from Photos.app, but there you go.  Thanks for all the other answers.  <answer121955> This is an answer that means you must hook your iPhone up to a box running OS  X. You can use Image Capture in OS X to select individual photos/video on your iDevice, and import/delete them. You can sort the files by "kind", that would show videos as "mp4", "mov" and so on.  <comment12208> Thanks, but I don't want all videos to be deleted - just enough to free up some space. <comment12240> You understand the question correctly. I'm going to check out Phone Explorer, thanks. But also check out the solution I found buried in camera.app. <comment12687> don't worry about the self-answer... that's actually encouraged to do it - as long as there's no other answer, such in this case. <comment103047> great answer!  i know about the camera.app allowing you to show only videos, but didn't realize that the "share" button would also allow you to delete your selections.  big help! thx
