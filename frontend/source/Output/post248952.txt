Mac Mini running El Capitan Server unresponsive <body> I have a Mac mini (Late 2012),  2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 Processor, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Memory that runs OS X Server 5.1.7.  Three times recently (I think since the upgrade to Server 5.1.7), the machine has become completely unresponsive and I have had to reboot it. On both occasions the fan was blowing full blast.  Given the complete lack of response I get the impression the CPU is completely tied up, but I can't see what process/es is/are causing it.  After the second occurrence I poked around in the log files a bit. In codesystem.log/code I found the following, which had been repeating for hours:  precode Aug  4 10:06:11 s-mx-01 configd[88]: could not allocate mach port: (os/kern) no space available /code/pre  I went back and tried to find out when it had started and found this:  precode Aug  3 18:05:44 s-mx-01 configd[88]: BUG in libdispatch: 15G31 - 384 - 0x1000600c  Aug  3 18:05:44 s-mx-01 configd[88]: could not allocate mach port: (os/kern) no space available /code/pre  Does anyone have any idea what this might mean? And how to fix it?  <answer250143> I managed to get into the system while it was manifesting the above symptoms. codeconfigd/code itself was consuming around 140% CPU; and there were 10 (!) instances of codesmtpd/code, each consuming around 40% CPU. Killing codeconfigd/code restored sanity (including removal of all the codesmtpd/code processes).  To find out what codeconfigd/code was up to I executed codesudo configd -v/code and the system seized up and had to be rebooted. So it seems to be a codeconfigd/code problem.  The call of codeconfigd -v/codedeposited the following in codesystem.log/code:  precodeAug 22 09:29:53 s-mx-01 sudo[26480]: macowner : TTY=ttys000 ; PWD=/Users/macowner ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/libexec/configd -v Aug 22 09:29:53 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: pthread_set_qos_class_self_np() failed: Operation not permitted Aug 22 09:29:54 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: SCDynamicStoreCreate() failed: Permission denied Aug 22 09:29:54 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: kernel event monitor disabled Aug 22 09:29:54 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: SCPreferencesScheduleWithRunLoop() failed: Permission denied Aug 22 09:29:54 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: SCDynamicStoreCreate() failed: Permission denied Aug 22 09:29:54 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: Network information server: Connection invalid Aug 22 09:29:54 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: DNS configuration server: Connection invalid Aug 22 09:29:54 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: Connection invalid Aug 22 09:29:55 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: flush_routes: removing route for 169.254.101.43 failed: No such process Aug 22 09:29:55 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: flush_routes: removing route for 169.254.173.101 failed: No such process Aug 22 09:29:55 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: flush_routes: removing route for 169.254.221.184 failed: No such process Aug 22 09:29:55 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: flush_routes: removing route for 169.254.224.132 failed: No such process Aug 22 09:29:55 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: IPMonitor ip_plugin_init SCDynamicStoreCreate failed: Permission denied Aug 22 09:29:55 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: SCDynamicStoreCreate() failed: Permission denied Aug 22 09:29:55 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: SCNC Controller: notify_register_check failed, status = 1000000 Aug 22 09:29:55 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: EAPOLController: SCDynamicStoreCreate() failed, Permission denied Aug 22 09:29:56 s-mx-01 configd[26484]: IPConfigurationSCPreferencesSetCallback failed: Permission denied` /code/pre  My current theory is that there is a configuration problem in the mailing system which unhinges codeconfigd/code.  <comment308646> It has run out off a resource - by the wording I would suggest either RAM or disk <comment308650> You may also want to contact Apple since `libdispatch` is part of Swift 3.  I would start with checking for updates and if all else fails, contact their support teams directly. <comment308656> @Mark: I thought it might have run out of disk, but the disk is only 21% full. I'll check RAM. <comment308657> @Allan: so I'm looking for a memory leak in a Swift 3 program... <comment308659> Probably.  But I don't have experience with Swift, but this is what I would look for. <comment308664> the console message might not be the app that is leaking the issue could be that another app is taking all the memory. Use Activity Monitor to confirm which app is taking memory <comment308809> @Mark: unfortunately I've been unable to get into the system to monitor its state when the problem manifests itself, so I haven't been able to use Activity Monitor to analyse the problem. <comment340217> Stephen, Did you ever resolve this? I have the same problem, generally preceded with configd: BUG in libdispatch. Running 10.12 and server 5.2 MV <comment340388> No, I never found the cause, though it seems to have gone away. Not sure how or when. I used `killd` on it a few times...
