How can I manually change default applications in OS X? <body> I'm facing an issue with Transmission's "Set Default Application" button - it seems to do nothing. Magnet links still don't work, so this feature is broken for me. I have been able to use Magnet links with uTorrent prior to switching to Transmission, so I know there's no issue there.  Is there an app or any manual way to set/change protocol associations without having to use the target application to set it?  I'm using Transmission 2.42 (13013) running on OS X Lion 10.7.2.  <answer28895> RCDefaultApp is a Preferences Panel which allows you to edit the default application used for various URL schemes, file extensions, file types and MIME types.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qsy5y.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment33217> Perfect! Thanks a lot! It was already the default app, but the UTI setting wasn't enabled and that seems to have done the trick! <comment279483> Worked for me, thanks <comment299306> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45491/how-to-change-file-type-associations?lq=1
