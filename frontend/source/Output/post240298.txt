Switch between windows by name on OSX <body> Is there a way to switch between windows by typing a portion of the target window's name? (like doing Spotlight search but for windows)  I frequently have many windows open, and CMD-Tab &amp; friends, and graphical utilities like Witch really don't cut it.   I am looking for something analogous to the Emacs iswitch.  https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight apparently used to do this (and much more) in prior versions of OSX.   <answer240339> I was (am) looking for a simple, one-trick, open source solution. Still looking.  But I did find a closed-source app that does what I need: allows me to switch between windows by typing any part(s) of app and/or window name:  https://contexts.co/  Not free. Not open source, has to be allowed to "control your computer" via Accessibility features.   I also tried Alfred; it cannot do this out of the box (but a workflow could probably be created).  <answer240399> h2Switch window by name/h2  strongAlfred workflow/strong to switch to a window by the name of the window title. Uses Alfred's adaptive searching engine to make filtering really quick as it learns which windows you usually switch to.  Usage: codewindow &lt;search window titles&gt;/code  You need to add Alfred to the list of apps allowed to control your computer in System Preferences → Security &amp; Privacy → Accessibility. If you don't, it fails silently.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uzE6.png" alt=""  Download: https://georgegarside.com/resources/SwitchWindowByName.alfredworkflowbr supOne day, I'll have a proper webpage for these workflows. Apologies for the direct download./sup  I did have it loading icons for the apps, but defaults takes too long to get the app icon. For something that's fast, waiting 1 second for it to load the icons takes too long, hence the uniform icon. At least it has the app name underneath!  Known bug: if a window title has the word "window" in it, stuff breaks! I've already spent hours on this workflow, sorry!  <answer278743> I tried grgarside's solution but his link timed out for me.  Ended up on Packal and found Swift Window Switcher  It only requires you to use it codew name/code instead of codewindow name/code and it also populates with Safari tabs. It, too, requires Accessibility permissions.  Still requires Alfred, which is paid, but it seems like the best solution I could find.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N0zYs.png" alt="Alfred Searching for Chrome, returning this question as an open window"  <comment295306> I'd be surprised if there isn't an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) workflow that lets you do this... maybe somebody can point you at one, or even write one for you ;) <comment295564> ... this requires typing "window" every time. I could probably live with typing "w" as the command. Maybe. <comment350829> My link was dead? Seems to be working fine for me, was it a 404 or something else? <comment350830> @Dmitri The command is customisable to be ‘w’ or anything else, or you can use a hotkey. All these things are editable in the workflow. <comment350834> @grgarside not a 404, but a bunch of unreadable characters for me. <comment350846> @grgarside it just doesn't seem is to resolve for me, I get a 522. <comment350855> @Glorfindel Seems like your browser doesn’t understand that an alfredworkflow is a binary file — you need to download it, there’s no readable content. <comment350856> @Ted Thanks for letting me know, but I don’t seem to be reproducing this and there’s no drop in my analytics, all I can say is it must have been a temporary glitch which has been cached in your browser, try a force refresh and apologies for the off topic comments on your answer. <comment350955> No problem.
