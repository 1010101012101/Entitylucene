What's the trivial difference between the 15" and 17" versions of the MacBook Pro? <body> What can I ask on the phone to a Mac user who has a MacBook Pro (Alu), but doesn't know if it's a 15 or a 17 one (and don't have a tool to measure the screen)  What can I ask him to look at to tell me what version it is?  <answer2422> Max screen resolution in Displays preferences.  <answer2424> In the left corner of the top menu, pick the apple menu and select codeAbout This Mac/code.  In the codeAbout This Mac/code panel, click the codeMore Info/code  button. if you hover your mouse on codeHardware/code you can see the general info about your macbook pro such 15" or 17".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n6xlg.jpg" alt="alt text"  As Dori said in comment above solution for before 2007 now choose Graphics/Displays from the left column, it does display the screen resolution.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1zpWk.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer2435> Might not be that Trivial, but emthe size between/em the side of the computer and the keyboard is larger in a 17’’ model:  MacBook Pro 15’’:   15&#39;&#39; http://www.sunsetmac.com/images/6615244.gif  MacBook Pro 17’’:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/soQYZ.gif" alt="17&#39;&#39;"  If the user fails to find the information as described above, you can tell him to count the number of holes (no measure required!) ;)  <answer2436> If it's the unibody MacBook Pro, I believe the 15" has an strongSD card slot/strong, and the 17" has an strongExpressCard/34 slot/strong. Also, the 15" only has strongtwo USB ports/strong, whereas the 17" has strongthree/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fcXYa.jpg" alt="15&quot; MacBook Pro"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6NZni.jpg" alt="17&quot; MacBook Pro"  <comment2090> Ok, I didn't notice that there were information in the "top chapters" of that tree. Thanks ! <comment2114> Mine tells only "MacBook Pro" :-( (it's 13") <comment2118> @peter As I test it in my macbook pro 13" it tells just MacBook Pro too,so I choose pic from google. <comment2127> Yeah, a 15" MBP has 1645 holes in each speaker grille, a 17" has more. Or did by "holes" did you mean the ports on the sides? Counting those might be a bit easier. <comment2128> Nono, I meant the “holes” in the speaker grille ;) <comment2134> This doesn't work. If you look at the screenshot, it's from 2007—System Profiler no longer shows the dimensions. However, if you choose Graphics/Displays from the left column, it does display the screen resolution. <comment10448> In earlier models it's a bit different - the late 2008 15" has an ExpressCard slot. Still only 2 USB sockets though.
