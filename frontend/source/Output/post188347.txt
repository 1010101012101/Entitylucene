iPad 2 Air Screen Not Responding <body> I received an iPad 2 Air about two months ago as a birthday present. Yesterday I was sitting in class and I turned it on to use it, but for some reason it said it was too hot. After the temperature warning went away, the screen was then unresponsive. I tried hard resetting it a few times, but it still doesn't work. I've never dropped it, that was the first time the temperature warning has occurred, and all of the outside button (home, hold, and volume) are working still.  <comment222868> Did the iPad feel warm? What's the ambient room temperature?
