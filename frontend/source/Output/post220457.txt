MacBook Pro 15" CPU Overheat <body> My MacBook pro 15" 2010 temperature gets over 150 c. Is this normal? I have attached an image for sensors temperature. I recently faced automatic restarts, is this related to temperature?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lfosw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer220460> The sensor temperatures probably show °Fahrenheit instead of °Celsius.  Open iStatMenus - Sensors and change the Degrees from Fahrenheit to Celsius.  The Palm Rest will show ~30 °C instead of 85 °F (mine - a similar MPB - has 31 °C), the CPU Die will show 54 °C  instead of 129 °F (mine has ~63 °C)...  <comment266826> Hmm - the ambient temperature of 88 isn't likely C - are you sure you have your temperature units correct? Everything looks perfectly normal if you are displaying °F and not °C - nothing makes sense if you are displaying °C unless you are working in an oven/kiln situation.
