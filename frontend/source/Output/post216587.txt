How can I disable all audio output from my OSX machine when the screen is locked <body> Essentially, I often forget to turn the sound down/off when leaving my OSX machine for the day. Since my computer is in my living room, I inevitably get a notification of some kind while watching TV, and have to laboriously get up and turn the sound off.   (Note that I basically never shut it down, I always just use a sleep corner.)  Is there a setting for disabling audio output entirely when the computer is asleep?  <answer216589> Option + Click on the Notification Center icon (the latest on the right in the bar) in Menu Bar will disable all kind of notification.  Here's the official article Turn off notifications  <answer216590> I figured out you can do this with the "Do not Disturb" feature in System Preferences - Notifications. I actually had it turned on, but had the checkbox with "From XXX to YYY" time checked. I unchecked that, and made sure the "When the display is sleeping" was checked, and that seems to do it!
