Windows keyboard on mac, change combinations? <body> I have my reasons why I use a Win keyboard on a Mac, I'm interested to know how can I change keyboard combinations like: change kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd vs. kbd Win /kbd key, I want on Mac to have kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd functionality on kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd key and kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd on kbd Win /kbd... it is possible or does any software exist for that?  <answer248689> You can change Modifier Key Assignment frombr System Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard  Modifier Keys...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HmbOf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment308241> Thank you, is there any default possibility to setup all combinations like on windows? I mean window switch, tab switch in browsers etc...? <comment308242> Not natively. BetterTouchTool & Karabiner are capable of that sort of tweak - but honestly, you'd be far better off in the long run just learning the difference.
