Launching Emacs app from the command line (MacPorts) <body> I have native emacs OS X apps installed through MacPorts (emacs-app and emacs-mac-app ports), on macOS Sierra. I would like to be able to launch emacs through the command line with a command like codeemacs doc.py/code.  I used to do this by aliasing codeemacs/code with the path to some binary in the OS X app (codealias emacs='PAGER=cat /Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs'/code). Now, on macOS Sierra, the clipboard is not recognized anymore, and typed keys go to the terminal (instead of to the emacs window).  I also tried the codeEmacs.sh/code script found in one of the apps: codealias emacs='PAGER=cat /Applications/MacPorts/EmacsMac.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs.sh'/code, but this does not help.  I also tried to launch the app itself while sending any file name to the emacs binary: codealias emacs='PAGER=cat open /Applications/MacPorts/EmacsMac.app --args'/code, but codeemacs doc.py/code opens a codedoc.py/code document which is not the one from the local directory.  How can one of MacPorts' native emacs ports be launched with arguments from the command line, as if it were the usual codeemacs/code command?
