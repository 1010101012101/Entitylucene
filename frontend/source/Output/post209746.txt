Music plays when I pause an audiobook <body> When I am listening to an audiobook (on iPhone 5c) with headphones, I'll press Pause and instead of pausing the book it starts playing the music I have stored on the phone. If I hit Pause again, it will stop the music but I then have to access the phone and then the Overdrive App in order to get back to the book. How can I prevent this from happening? It only does this when I'm using the headphones.
