I've changed my iPhone 3g battery, but it's stuck on 61% <body> Hey guys I did a search and couldn't find anything that really suited my situation. I recently changed my iPhone battery, the phone turns on and the battery decrease immediately. It decreased 1% within 10 seconds yet when I try to charge it the battery increased quickly and charge icon in the top right immediately goes to the plug icon and will not charge my phone (Currently sits at 61% and drains regardless of being plugged in or not). When I turn it off and when I turn it on, it decreased to 44%. The phone is recognized on my computer and I also have tried two new batteries because I thought one of them might of been bad. So please any suggestions what the problem is?  <comment106254> Clean your battery pins with Toothbrush. Not any metallic objects.
