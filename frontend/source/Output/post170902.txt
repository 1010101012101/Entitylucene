Is it possible to render $\LaTeX$ in Safari? <body> Is there a Safari extension for rendering LaTeX in webpages?

In particular, the “render MathJax” bookmarklet sounds exactly like what you want:     strongrender MathJax/strong installs MathJax and renders $\LaTeX$ once per execution. This is intended for use on web pages where the contents of the page are static.   These were originally written for Math.se users to get MathJax rendering in their chatroom within SE spending development time adding it to chat, but I see no reason why it wouldn’t work on an arbitrary webpage (and indeed, it seems to work like that on the installation page).  <comment201021> stackexchange sites that allow Latex, such as math.se, use something called MathJax.  But it runs on the server side, not just in the browser.  See http://www.mathjax.org <comment201030> I know it, but i want extension that will render all expressions like $...$
