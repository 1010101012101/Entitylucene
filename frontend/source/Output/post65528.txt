how to create daily task for GMVault in automator <body> I just moved to Apple, being an experienced (i'd like to think so) Windows user.  Recently I started using GMvault (gmvault.org) to backup my Gmail account locally, but it's become a pain having to manually launch a terminal and type ./gmvault sync -t quick myemail@gmail.com  if i wanted to automate this task on Mac OSX 10.8.2, what would be the right/best way to do it? Is it using an Automator task? I've heard of Cron too..so, Im open to suggestions. What is the most correct (and maintainable) way to do this?  In windows I would've just created a .bat file and setup a Scheduled Task.  Thanks for the help!  <answer65530> As you mentioned you can use cron which is more transferable knowledge since it's used also on other platforms. Or you can use LaunchDaemon which is more Macish ;)  strongCron/strong  Please refer to question How do I run a cron job on a Mac?  strongLaunchd/strong  ul liDoc/li lishort how to  ul lifile for service looks like this/li liyou will copy that file into code/Library/LaunchAgents/code.

I usually use launch daemon. Theres you just say what is the working directory by `WorkingDirectory` tag
