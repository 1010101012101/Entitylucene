XMPP Server on iOS <body> Following situation: I (and other iDevice users) are in a big WLAN without Internet. Now we need some way to communicate. I found different apps, that works in a Wifi network but these apps requires the app to be active. But there are many XMPP Clients in the App Store. I wondered if anybody knows a XMPP Server for iOS, so that I can place an iPad somewhere in the Wifi and the other Devices can connect to the iPad.
