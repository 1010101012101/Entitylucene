Why rebooted Macbook Pro with Mountain Lion prevents adding or moving files at Desktop? <body> Whenever I reboot my Macbook Pro since installing OSX 10.8 the desktop is locked, prohibiting files from being dropped on or moved from the desktop. I can right-click, select “Get Info” and uncheck the “locked” box, but it will return the locked status the next time the machine sleeps or reboots.   How can I keep the desktop unlocked?  <answer85393> The OS X Recovery Mode has a utility called coderesetpassword/code which, apart from the obvious, will also reset the permissions for your home holder.  ol liRestart your Mac and hold down kbdcmd ⌘-R/kbd, and keep holding them until the Apple icon appears./li liOnce started up, from the menu bar at the top, go strongUtilities/strong  strongTerminal/strong/li liType in coderesetpassword/code and hit enter, and the Reset Password utility will open./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UICMA.png" alt="Reset Password utility"  ol start="4" liSelect the user, change the password, and hit 'Save' to save the password, and then below that hit 'Reset' to fix the permissions/li /ol  <comment98402> You may want a more descriptive tile for your question :-)
