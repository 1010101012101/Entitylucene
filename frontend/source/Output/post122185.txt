How to Extract Icon or Image From Folder File (Then automating the process) <body> I just purchased a new macbookpro (retina - late 2013) &amp; when I transfered my extensive library of icon images and files almost 50% of them were nonvisible as they simply read as "folder" files. On my older mac, early 2011 model (both are running mavericks btw) it shows up just fine. So I did get info and copied the file opening and saving it in preview, however because there are SO many files to do the same to, I wanted to automate the process. I figured automator but in order to do that I needed the command line prompt to achieve it. Ive visited other question pages however when testing the commands on the mac it didn't seem to work always coming up with somekind of error. I also tried this guys method with the derez found here: http://blog.observationpoint.org/post/35715124002/setting-custom-icon-on-folders-in-mac-os-x-from-the but again was unsuccesful. Please Help!! How do I extract and automate the process of getting icons from folder files.
