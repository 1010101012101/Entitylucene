Macbook Pro.[Mid-2012] Sound isn't working <body> Suddenly, My MBP sound isn't working. I have tried couple of way to resolve the problem but nothing is working. Here is some of the screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JMzjH.jpg" alt="sound"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dBO9c.jpg" alt="sound 2"  No, input or output sound. I would like to know  1) How can I resolve this?br/ 2) Can you suggest any software, that can route my sound in iPad/iPhone.  strongUpdate:/strong  After running this command :br/  precodekextstat &gt; ~/Desktop/kexts.txt /code/pre  I got only this strongcom.apple.iokit.IOAudioFamily/strong But, didn't found strongcom.apple.driver.AudioAUUC/strong  strongUpdate - 2:/strong  As Buscar suggested to check for codeAudioAUUC.kext/code file in my code/System/Library/Extensions/code. Yes, I found AudioAUUC.kext file in that folder. As you can see in the image codeNo/code indicates, it's not loading.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6k2cJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  LOG UPDATED: http://pastebin.com/Qgj0WcpC  New Log: http://pastebin.com/R2RPZZZN  Update - 3:  As suggested to codeResetting the PRAM/code didn't worked. I was able to update SMC and not EFI Firmware. It's showing an error:strongSoftware is not supported on my system/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DbE1a.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, I also tried to load and unload Apple High Definition Audio (HDA)codeAppleHDA.kext/code. But, while loading this error are showing  precode1/24/15 8:29:57.000 PM kernel[0]: Sound assertion in AppleHDACodecGeneric at line 1280 1/24/15 8:29:57.000 PM kernel[0]: Sound assertion in AppleHDACodecGeneric at line 1580 1/24/15 8:29:57.000 PM kernel[0]: Sound assertion in AppleHDACodecGeneric at line 1073 1/24/15 8:29:57.000 PM kernel[0]: Sound assertion in AppleHDACodecGeneric at line 1073 /code/pre  Update - 4:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2MlHN.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see codecom.apple.audio.sandboxhelper/code is missing.  update - 5:  I tried all the things, you said to do. But, still I can't hear any sound. I tried codeioreg -i/code. But, i couldn't find anything called codeAudioAUUCDriver/code. You can check here  http://pastebin.com/8uC6jLn7   Update - 6:  Guys, I can hear sound through a application called PocketAudio. My microphone and speaker both are working!! I just want to know, is there any problem in my hardware or in OS? If I buy a wireless headphone, should it work?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bg8ab.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer168298> Something killed your coreaudio drivers, or the sound hardware/motherboard.  I would suggest to do following order of investigation (Fixes)  ol liOpen Activity monitor and look for following: (use sort by "Audio")/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EIcB0.jpg" alt="coreaudiod"  If found use terminal to reset the coreaudiod  precodesudo killall coreaudiod /code/pre  ol start="2" liCopy/paste following in Terminal to find out if the audio drivers are loaded  precodekextstat &gt; ~/Desktop/kexts.txt /code/pre  That will output a text file to your desktop. Use any text editor to search for "Audio"  You should have the  precodecom.apple.iokit.IOAudioFamily   com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC /code/pre/li /ol  As reported the result is: AudioAUUC.kext is not been loaded?  ol start="3" liLets try to load it manually using Terminal codesudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AudioAUUC.kext//code/li /ol  strongUPDATE:/strong   Based on new information I would suggest following (still trying to find out why your Audio is not loading in the profile.  ul liResetting the PRAM. Hold Down Cmd-Opt-P-R/li /ul  Keep Holding until you have hear the "startup sound twice". strongIf you do not hear the system sound then, you are on mute or your sound card is broken./strong  To un-mute use codesudo nvram -d SystemAudioVolume/code  emTest for start up sound!/em  ul liIf not run codeioreg -i/code and look for the codeAudioAUUCDriver  &lt;class AudioAUUCDriver, id 0x1000003af, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 5&gt;/code (use Edit - Find AudioAUUCDriver)/li /ul  <answer169327> In order to diagnose a hardware vs. OS error, try starting from external bootable media. The easiest way to do this is using a Linux Live CD. This allows you to start a totally separate, different and self-sufficient operating system. If you can get sound through that, it means the problem lies within your Mac OS X setup.  You can download a disk image here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop  If you can't or do not want to burn a CD or DVD, you can also make a USB drive. This can be automatically done using UnetBootIn (see: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net ). You will need a fairly big USB drive and it will be formatted so make sure you have no files on it you want to keep.  I am suggesting Linux here because we also need to rule out a OS X-specific problem. Of some sort of EFI, HDA or OS X IOReg communication or matching failure causes CoreAudio not to load or to function properly, reinstalling OS X or booting form an external OS X drive might not help with further diagnostics.  <comment197503> I did a fresh install. But, it didn't worked :-( @Buscar웃 <comment197504> Still, do you suggest a osx system restore? <comment197506> In safe boot, It was shows same as normal boot. I run AHT couple of time, But it didn't show any problem. When I run AHT first time, only that time i heard the startup sound. But, after that it has gone. <comment197526> Turning the computer completely off, waiting 30 seconds, and starting it again did not help? <comment197529> Installing additional applications like Soundflower won't help in case of hardware issues <comment197533> @ThorbjørnRavnAndersen No. <comment197534> Yeah, Sound button button isn't grayed anymore after installing SoundFlower. But, Still no sound!! <comment197541> What happens when you try headphones/external speakers? <comment197573> @DennisJaheruddin No Sound!! <comment197621> OK, now it would be interesting to see your console log from the moment when restart and then some 50 lines after that to find out why that driver is not loading or any other relevant messages. You can copy paste in here or use pastebin, dropbox links. <comment197636> Look for the AudioAUUC.kext file in your /System/Library/Extensions. If it is there (and it should be) than your I/O kit driver is not working properly. <comment197715> Yes, I found AudioAUUC.kext in Extensions folder. @Buscar웃 <comment197724> I added the log would please check. <comment197734> We don't know what the problem is, but your answer suggests "killed" coreaudio drivers (which a reboot should fix) or hardware. In both cases adding an audio routing app won't help <comment197750> sorry the log was not log enough (need all of it) but for now found line 137 "1/22/15 11:49:55.000 AM kernel[0]: Sound assertion in AppleHDACodecGeneric at line 1073" I suggest to try unload then load the Apple High Definition Audio (HDA)                             "sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext"  "sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext" <comment197766> I added New Log @Buscar웃 <comment197998> Answers shouldn't be used to "guess the problem", please use comments or chat for that <comment198175> Someone down voted this answer. <comment198192> @Buscar웃 I don't have any idea. <comment198388> Do you actually hear the start up chime (sound) or not? <comment198445> No. I don't hear any kind of sound. @Buscar웃 <comment198446> @Buscar웃 I couldn't find anything called AudioAUUCDriver. I added the log. Would you please check the update-5. <comment198578> Great job, all the searching was worth $1000 for not replacing the mother board since the hardware works!. I made a big mistake at the beginning! it looks like somehow your user permissions were disabled for the Audio and the PocketAudio has enabled it for it self. When reinstalling the OS the user permissions do not get changed which would explain it. <comment199171> I tried with Live Ubuntu. No Sound!! <comment199342> If you are willing to try one more thing, boot Ubuntu again and open a terminal. Run: lspci and post the output here. It should show the devices that are detected. If the sound card is there, we can go on from there. If it's not, you have a hardware problem. <comment199379> Output = http://pastebin.com/nCFGHw0Z <comment199406> Okay, the PCI device is there, which makes sense since it's integrated in the Intel chipset. High Definition Audio Controller however might not exactly be the chip you only want: a Cirrus or Maxim audio chip is supposed to be there as well. Does PocketAudio still work? <comment199437> Yes. It's work. <comment199527> Can you post the last 4 characters of your serial number? I'll check to ser what other audio chips should be detected for your model. <comment199572> Yes, sure. It's "DTY3". <comment199830> I believe that means your motherboard has a CS4206A sound chip from Cirrus Logic. They can be attached via PCIe or via the Intel HD Audio bus. Either way, if for some reason the normal path at which it is connected is messed up, you won't get any sound. Since Linux didn't show that chip in the PCI list, I believe that it is supposed to be connected via the HD Audio bus, or if it was connected to the PCIe bus, that connection has been broken.  In System Information on OSX, your Audio ID should be something like 28, not 0. When you use pocket audio, does that number change? <comment199969> No, It's still 0. <comment200440> In that case I'm running out of ideas. Sounds to me that part of the HD Audio bus has come loose. <comment212367> Today, I don't what happened. But, sound is working perfectly :-)
