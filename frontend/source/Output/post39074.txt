Can I set a password on an existing dmg? <body> I am just wondering if it's possible to set a password to existing dmg image. There is no such option at Disk Utility.   <answer39075> You can change it by first selecting the DMG in Disk Utilty. Then go to ImagesChange Password.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qYB7.png" alt="Change Password - Disk Utility"br It will prompt you for the password. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a1lw6.png" alt="prompt for password - Disk Utility"br Then, it'll ask you for a new password for the DMG. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wu4Ds.png" alt="New password prompt"  <answer260640> you add a password and then add disc passwords now  <comment44225> @com File? It's under the Images menu, unless you have an older OS... <comment44227> Anyway, thanks!!! <comment140752> This does not seem to work under Mavericks though. The Images menu does not include the Change Password… item. What now? <comment172052> @Aller, go to File-Change Password like the user above mentioned. <comment326368> Welcome to Ask Different!
