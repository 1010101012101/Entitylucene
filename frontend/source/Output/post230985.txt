How do I change the date format in iOS? <body> I live in the U.S., so my region is in the U.S. I want to make the iPad use the following formats:  ul liFahrenheit for temperature/li liKilometers for distance/li liUSD for currency/li listrongcodeYYYY-MM-DD/code date format/strong/li licodeHH:mm/code 24-hour time format./li /ul  strongHow do I set up iOS to respect these preferences of mine?/strong  <answer230988> The time and date format can be set according to the generally accepted usage in a particular region in iOS devices.   Regions are selected in codeSettings&gt;General&gt;International&gt;Region Format/code.  hr  Sorry I misunderstood the question, I'm adding in the following more details.  Independently from the region you can always set the strong24-hour time format/strong in: codeSettings&gt;General&gt;Date &amp; Time&gt;24-Hour Time/code, the strongtemperature scale/strong in codeWeather/code options and the strongdistance scale/strong in: codeSettings&gt;Maps/code.   Anyway, as far as I know, you can't set strongdate format/strong and/or strongcurrency/strong, in a different way from the specified region.  <answer259005> Set the region to Canada to get metric date format.   <comment282121> So... what region gives my the formats I specify in my question? <comment282127> @BenC.R.Leggiero I updated the answer. <comment282130> thanks for the update! I voted it up, but I can't bring myself to accept an answer of "as far as I know, what you want isn't possible." I hope that's OK. <comment282134> @BenC.R.Leggiero yes sure, I totally agree. You can wait a few days and then also _start a bounty_ . I'm also curious to know how to deal with this problem.
