Multiple video track layers in iMovie? <body> I have a four videos of the same event (a band playing) all taken from different angles.  I'd like to make a concert video of the footage.  Nothing special, just cut from angle to angle throughout the song -- use the guitar player close up on the guitar solo -- that sort of thing.  Is there a way in iMovie to layout each video in a separate "layer" (sort of like in Photoshop), and then (after I sync them to the audio), movie the "camera" from one layer to another?  If iMovie can't do that, is there other software that can?  Thanks!  <answer256873> You can't really do this in iMovie as it is limited to 2 video tracks. You can do it in Final Cut or Premiere Pro if you're willing to spend the money, or HitFilm Express if you want don't want to spend a penny.
