From the command-line, how can I set all accounts to Available in all Messages.app <body> Is there a scriptable way from the terminal I can tell Messages.app to take all my accounts online?   <answer171790> Executing this applescript all your account will be in available status:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "Messages"         tell menu bar 1             tell menu bar item "Messages"                 tell menu "Messages"                     tell menu item "My Status"                         tell menu "My Status"                             click menu item "Available"                         end tell                     end tell                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  You can save it as code~/turn_available.scpt/code and execute in the terminal with this command:  precodeosascript ~/turn_available.scpt /code/pre
