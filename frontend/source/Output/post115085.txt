Notification message's delay before hide <body> I made a script to upload images, it shows a notification, but it stays on screen for a very long time until I close it by click.   Is there a way to decrease the delay for this notification?  <comment134737> Perhaps share how the script is calling the notifications? <comment134747> display notification input with title "Uploader" subtitle "Image iploaded"
