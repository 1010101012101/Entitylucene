trying to get Didot font into a Parallels 8 VM <body> All,  Can anyone direct me to a link or provide instructions on how to get the Didot font (True Type I believe) into MS Outlook 2012 running in a VM?   <comment113773> The guide on [Ask] will help you refine your question by showing what you've tried and/or what exactly "you don't get". If you don't get a good answer, feel free to try editing in some details or links on what question you used and what step is failing or doesn't make sense. We love details here. <comment113805> In the same way you would do it when not running in a VM.
