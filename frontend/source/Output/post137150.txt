Second battery failure <body> I replaced my battery on my mid-2010 13" MacBook Pro less than a year ago, while it was still under AppleCare. My new battery is now telling my computer to give me the "service battery" indicator. Is this typical and should I replace the computer or the battery if necessary?  Some additional information: even when I am not running any flash-based webpages, I burn through a charge in a few hours.  <comment162905> smells like your computer <comment162906> How many discharge cycles does it have? <comment162907> @MaxRied, Just passed the 500 mark, I thought it was significantly lower. <comment162908> @Noah This is quite a lot. What capacity has it remaining? <comment162912> @MaxRied, 1820 milliamps <comment162913> You mean 1820 mAh? <comment162915> @MaxRied, yes, bad at reading SI units other than those used on a daily basis <comment162916> That's way too little for 500 cycles from my understanding. But I won't blame the rest of your computer. I guess you got a bad battery. <comment162924> 500 is 2x to much for 1 Yr old. when reading battery health look at the Full Charge Capacity (mAh): it should be  5000 for your computer.Use the Activity monitor to tell us what is highest energy consumption. <comment162939> @Buscarì›ƒ, Firefox. I don't like using Safari and I detest Chrome. I also use Opera, but all of my bookmarks et c. are on Firefox, as well as all of my university materials (I always have problems using BlackBoard with other apps). I guess my problem is that I always keep my browser open. <comment162940> @MaxRied, it's at 4385 mAh at 100%. <comment162942> Do one complete discharge cycle (just let it run till your computer shuts down),  to calibrate it, also reset your SMC.
