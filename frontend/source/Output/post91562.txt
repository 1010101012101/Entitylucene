Installed Windows in wrong partition and now shows "no bootable device" <body> I chose the wrong partition to install Windows on my MacBook Pro Retina.  How do I reinstall Mountain Lion? I tried ⌘R but the only thing I get is:     No Bootable Device -- Insert boot disk and press any key   <answer91587> Since Boot Camp sets your Windows partition as the Startup Disk, some keyboard commands on boot become very temperamental or may not work at all.  Try holding kbd⌥ alt/kbd on startup - see if you can select the recovery partition.  If not, you might have to re-install the OS from disc or external drive.
