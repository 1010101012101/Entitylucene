Can entry duplicates (or multiples) in etc/hosts do any damage? <body> Can entry duplicates in etc/hosts do any damage?  For example:  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.  127.0.0.1       localhost 127.0.0.1       localhost 127.0.0.1       localhost  # and stuff like that throughout the file /code/pre  <answer111268> No, having duplicates is not a problem. Since the file is read in order, the first matching result is read, and the rest of the file is ignored. Having exact duplicates has no effect.  <comment130988> Thanks! Thought so, but then again... in my country they say he who asks, roams not ;-)
