Mail search not finding messages but Spotlight does <body> When I search for a particular message in Mail.app, using the search field, even when I have the message in sight, Mail cannot find it. But, frustratingly, when I use Spotlight, it is able to find the message.  For example, I'll open a folder with a variety of recipes. I can see all the subjects and I see an email with the subject: "Smoothies". Typing in "Smoothies" into the search field brings up 0 results. But typing in "Smoothies" into Spotlight shows the desired message.  strongHow can I get Mail.app to search correctly?/strong  I'm running Mac OS X 10.11.3.  <answer230332> Rebuilding Mail.app's mailboxes fixed this for me. This ComputerWorld article is a great reference for rebuilding and reindexing your mailboxes:  ul listrongRebuild/strong: Select a mailbox (or several by shift-clicking) and then use "Mailbox  Rebuild"/li listrongReindex/strong: Quit Mail, navigate to code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/code (on Mac OS 10.12 - Sierra, code~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData/code) and delete any files where the name begins with codeEnvelope Index/code. Mail will rebuild the indexes on the next start (which may take a long time depending on the size of your mailboxes)/li /ul  <answer264089> This helped me - it allows unrestricted spotlight search - and, after executing that command, mail search and smart mailboxes worked again  Open terminal from the utilities folder and execute:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.appsandbox \     UnrestrictSpotlightContainerScope -bool true /code/pre  <answer286666> for years I had this problem (on and off) and tried everything I could find. Finally I found this: for some reason indexing was turned off and I had to 'switch it on' with strongsudo mdutil -a -i on/strong After that mail search immediately worked. Hope this will make a few people less frustrated with mail (like I was)  <comment360101> This has also worked for me every time I have this problem. <comment361708> When I delete the Envelope files (three of them) from the `V3/MailData` directory on Mac OS 10.11, I get a message on next opening about *migrating* mail from the previous version of Mail, which isn't what the article said.  So I put them back.  But search still isn't working at all. <comment370591> For years I had this problem on one of my several devices and this was the solution!! Thank you!! <comment371014> Problem occurred out of the blue without my changing anything (that I am aware of). Rebuilding did not help, but reindexing sure did! Thanks!
