Facebook iOS app won't connect unless wi-fi enabled <body> I recently download the Facebook app for iOS. It doesn't connect to the internet unless wi-fi is enabled. All other apps are able to connect to the internet with wi-fi disabled, just not Facebook. I am running iOS 9.3.  <answer245905> The only possible thing that I could think of is that you may have disabled maybe accidently Cellular Data for Facebook and to verify you could go into strongSettings - Cellular/strong and verify that under emUSE CELLULAR DATA FOR:/em is turned on for Facebook.  Another rare possibility could be that there might be a DNS issue with your cellular data provider whereas it wouldn't be able to reach Facebook on its own network.  <comment303424> cell data was turned off for the facebook app
