how can I use my macbook pro as a primary display for my mac mini? <body> I want to use my Apple Mac Mini without connecting a monitor through the VGA, I have also a MacBook pro and an iPad. I want to know how I can use the MacBook pro (ideally wirelessly) to act as the display and keyboard and mouse for my Mac Mini.   <answer150686> Wirelessly I think you'd have to use something like VNC, which is built-in to the Mac OS.  Maybe see https://www.realvnc.com/products/ which I've had some success with.  Alternatively, there's Apple Remote Access, but that is more for a corporate environment &amp; is reflected in the price.   <comment177402> /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app
