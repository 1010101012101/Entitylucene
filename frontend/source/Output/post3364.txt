Downloading voicemail to my laptop <body> How can I download my voicemail from the iPhone to my computer?   Technically, I know it is not voicemail on the iPhone - it is in ATT's phone system but you knew what I meant.  How can I download my ATT voicemail from the iPhone/iTunes to my computer?   <answer3371> You can't do it in iTunes, and you have to be jailbroken to do it. Here's a good tutorial.  ol liJailbreak phone /li liInstall OpenSSH from Cydia/li liInstall CyberDuck (or another SSH program) to your computer/li liSSH into your iPhone from the computer (here's how)/li liNavigate to code/private/var/mobile/Library/Voicemail//code/li liCopy the desired code.amr/code files/li /ol  <answer3373> Or use Google voice and you can get them through the browser or emailed to you.  <answer48909> There is another way. Per this instructables an iTunes backup of the iPhone contains the voicemail files in these folders:  ul licode~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup//codebr Mac/li licode\Documents and Settings\(username)\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\/codebr Windows XP/li licode\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\/codebr Vista and Windows 7/li /ul  However, the bad news is that these voicemail files are mixed in with a ton of other random files from your iPhone, and all the files have long, meaningless filenames with no extensions. To determine what the files are, use the codefile */code command. Note that the backup must not be encrypted for this approach to work.  precodefile * | grep audio file * | grep GSM /code/pre  (on Windows install Cygwin and use the Cygwin terminal to get the file command)  The two file contents that seem likely are  precodeRIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 8 bit, mono 44100 Hz Adaptive Multi-Rate Codec (GSM telephony)   /code/pre  <answer48911> I use an app called "iExplorer" (formerly iPhone Explorer).  It basically lets you reach into the phone to download, modify, replace, or add a file in any (or almost any) directory within the file structure.  http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/  <answer48915> I use Phone View for this purpose and it works flawlessly. You do not have to jailbreak your phone for it to work.  <answer140653> I have a Google Voice number that I just forward important voicemails to.  To do this in a typical voicemail system, you'd press 6 for more options, then 2 to forward it.  You can keep them in your Google account pretty much as long as you want, or you can simply download them at will.  I hope this is helpful.  <comment3125> These are existing voicemail messages. <comment55977> Your phone has to be jailbroken for iExplorer to access voicemail files.  Apparently the paid version (Phone to Mac or Phone to PC) will copy voicemail off a 'regular' iPhone: http://www.macroplant.com/phonetomac/ <comment206885> You can also get `file` on Windows from [GnuWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/file.htm), which is a lighter install than Cygwin, since you can cherry pick just the `file` utility. <comment206886> To use a file, make a copy of it and rename it to have a `.amr` extension.
