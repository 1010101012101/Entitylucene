Update iPad 3 iOS 5.1.1 to 7.0.4 not 7.1? <body> I have iPad 3 iOS 5.1.1 Jailbroken.  I now want to update to 7.0.4 or 7.0.6 but can NOT figure out how. (7.1.1 is currently the official update)  Manual updates thru iTunes to a 7.0.6 restore file always result in "This device isn't eligible" error despite hosts editing. I've tried on multiple computers.  Am I hosed?  <answer128593> Actually you can't update iOS devices to old versions.  <comment150616> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.

Guess I'll wait for the iOS 8 jailbreak.
