Find out which app icon is missing in xcode for an app <body> I already published an app succesfull to the appstore.  But now something has changed and I get an error when publish again the same app:  ul liMissing required icon file. The bundle does not contain an app icon for iPad 152x152/li liMissing required icon file. The bundle does not contain an app icon for iPad 167x167/li /ul  How can I find out which of the icons are wrong. I cant see any slot with 152pt in the appicon.xcassets.  I have already created all possible icons with an icon-maker tool and I see all icons of my appicon.xcasset, but now something seems to have changed. I can't figure out which one is missing.  Any hints ?  <answer241755> The error is telling you which icons are missing. Go to codeimages.xcassets/code and click on codeAppIcon/code. You'll see the strong76pt 2x (76 * 2 = 152)/strong and strong83.5 2x (83.5 * 2 - 167)/strong.   <comment297045> Is this a universal, iPhone, or iPad app?  It's only asking for iPad icons so maybe you made a change to iPad or Universal? <comment297046> No did no change. My app is and was always for iphone and ipad. How can I find out which Icon I have to change or add ? <comment297058> The error is telling you which icons are missing.  Go to `images.xcassets` and click on `AppIcon`.  You'll see the 76pt 2x (76 * 2 = 152) and 83.5 2x (83.5 * 2 - 167).  If this fixes the problem, let me know and I'll add it to the answer for you to accept. <comment297059> Ah. Thats a good hint: 76*2 = 152. I'll try. <comment297061> Worked. My tool also produced a file icon152, which was in reality 76pt, but this was another issue. Your hint with  76*2=152 helped me alot. YOu can answer and I will accept. kind regards <comment297077> Glad it helped!  Just an FYI, you might get better/faster answers regarding Xcode and app development if you use StackOverflow for your questions.  Most developers use that site, too.
