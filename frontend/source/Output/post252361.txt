Installing Windows 10 via Boot Camp & official Microsoft retail USB <body> strongTL:DR version./strongbr If I bought an official retail USB key of Windows 10, can I use it as-is in Boot Camp Assistant or do I need to make a new key from a downloaded .iso?  hr  A question on Super User prompted me to try research this, but Apple's Boot Camp instructions are somewhat confusing...

Fortunately that is both easy and legal, just go here.  Download the same version you bought and save it to your Mac's hard drive. I would use a different USB key so you don't lose your original. But then if all you need it for is Boot Camp on the Mac go for it and use your Windows USB key with Boot Camp.  <comment313986> Would you not have to do the reverse of the answer to this question: [Creating A Bootable USB Of Windows 8.1 On OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103874/creating-a-bootable-usb-of-windows-8-1-on-os-x) <comment313988> Well, wouldn't the reverse be - not have to burn your own USB stick, use the one you just bought?... but I'm trying to ascertain if that's possible. <comment313989> First of all, does the Mac use a USB stick to install Windows? If you need the stick, then Mac uses a different format than a PC uses. Also, the Boot Camp Support Software needs to be on the on the stick.
