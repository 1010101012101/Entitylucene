Re-upload or add back icloud backup apps <body> Is there a way to manually re-add apps to iCloud backup. I subscribe to the 50GB service and I always have 37GB free, which seems a waste.  Is it possible to add some apps back into the upload process, seems useless you can't do from the phone.   Thanks.  <answer252658> According to this Apple Support page, you can add apps to iCloud backup on the iPhone this way:     h1Select which iOS apps to back up/h1      Many apps automatically back up to iCloud after you install them.
