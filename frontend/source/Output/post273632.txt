Mouse Keys & Num Lock <body> It would be sweet to use mouse keys without the numberpad - ie. letters and numbers on keboard. But there is no codenum lock/code or codeclear/code key on my keyboard. I also have no number pad accessible. My mouse keys is currently enabled, but when I hit code8/code or codel/code or any of the other keys, they act normally.   Help?  <comment344010> afaik, mouse keys only works with a 10-key, not the 'regular' numbers. To the OS, they register as different keys.
