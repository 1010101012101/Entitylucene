How can I prevent the administrator password prompts? <body> When deleting files, installing new applications, running AppleScript code, etc, I am prompted to enter my administrator password:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUREe.png" alt="Administator Prompt"  How can I set it so that everything I do is authorized to where it doesn't require a password?  strongNote/strong: I'm running OS X Yosemite v10.10.5 (14F27).  <answer200472> You can use the strongroot/strong user. This is highly unrecommended, but it will never show you an administrator privileges dialog.  <answer200536> emThis method does work, but I'm not sufficient a nix guru to know if there could be unforeseen side effects, so a) proceed with caution &amp; b) if anyone knows better or has useful caveats, please let us know./em  You could set the permissions to group codewheel/code instead of codeadmin/code or codestaff/code, then add yourself to the codewheel/code group if you're not already a member.  The codewheel/code group historically behaves like codeadmin/code or codestaff/code but doesn't require a password if you are a member of it. It also is not an automatic addition when setting up a new admin account, it must be conferred manually.  You can test on the root level of the boot drive, as that's one place where creating or deleting a file will always ask for your password if group is set to admin or staff, rather than wheel.br emDon't recklessly 'Apply to enclosed'./em  I find BatChmod's GUI interface easy to understand &amp; simpler to use than terminal.br Horizontal lines mean 'no change'. This will preserve existing ownership &amp; Everyone perms whilst changing the group permissions in the example below.br Apply to enclosed will recursively change all the contents of your chosen folder, so use with extreme care.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRAmb.png" alt="enter image description here"  to check what groups you are already in, use Terminalbr codeid myname/codebr You should already be in admin &amp; staff, amongst others.    If you're not already a member of wheelbr codesudo dscl . append /Groups/wheel GroupMembership myname/codebr which will request your password &amp; add you to that group. Test again with codeid myname/code  This appears to require a relog before the system recognises the change.  <answer258627> Apple actually gives you fined grained control over what requires admin prompt using the security authorizationdb command.  See https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/managing-the-authorization-database-in-os-x-mavericks/  Authbuddy also is also a 3rd party tool that is supposed to make this easier http://www.dssw.co.uk/authbuddy/index.html  <comment241550> Useful information and something I'll keep in mind, but is this the *only* way? I would much prefer to use my personal account. <comment241552> It is for your protection, like seatbelt in the car. <comment241559> How often are you being prompted?  I know it can a bit annoying however it's for your own good, as every user is their own worst enemy especially when wanting to subvert security measures. <comment241560> Quite often. I'd estimate around 100 in the last hour. @user3439894 <comment241563> Sounds like something is seriously wrong.  You might want to elaborate a bit more on things. The only time I've had anywhere near that number of prompts was when I first built out my system and installed close to that number of programs.  However with day-to-day every day use the number of prompts is negligible in comparison although appropriate for thing that I might be doing. <comment241565> Generally the prompts appear when I'm cleaning up files from all of other accounts. @user3439894 <comment241573> @ZachGates I don't believe there is any other way. Apple sets this as an impassable security feature <comment241638> Downvote with no explanation, on an answer I was asking for confirmation/correction/clarification on? Really?? With great power comes great responsibility...oh, no, sorry, it doesn't, this is the interweb. <comment241673> You've got some nice general answers. If you want to narrow things down, why not ask a second follow up question. The answer how to get AppleScript not to prompt is different than the answer to avoid having other user files pop a prompt is different from app installations. It would be best to explain what app installation is causing this - then we can answer exactly without guessing. <comment323394> Welcome to Ask Different!
