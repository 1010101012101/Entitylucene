KeyRemap4MacBook Meta + KEY Repeat Question <body> I come from a Linux/PC world as a heavy Emacs user and for the last year, I've "dealt" with the standard OS X key remapping. It's OK, but the things that bother me are:  ul liOption + Key doesn't operate as Meta by default (though works inside Emacs), instead it operates as a compose key./li liControl-C/Control-V are not true cut-n-paste/li liWhy the hell did the Function key have to be where the Control-L key should be?/li /ul  I spent some time yesterday with KeyRemap4MacBook and PCKeyboardHack and came up with a general approximation of what I want.  emPCKeyboardHack - Swap CapsLock/em  ul liSelect Caps Lock-Change Caps Lock/li liEnter keycode 63 (for Fn key)/li /ul  emKeyRemap4MacBook - Move things around/em  ul liCommand_L to Escape/li liCommand_R to Escape/li liControL to Fn/li liFn to Control_L (+ Option-L+Fn to Fn)/li liOption_L to Command_L/li liOption_R to Control_R/li liUse PC Style Copy/Paste/li /ul  The only thing that remains "broken" is the use of Option_L or Option_R as a pressed meta-key and another key on the keyboard. Meta-F and Meta-B are commonly used Emacs keybindings for hopping forward and backwards between words. With the configuration above, I must release the Option key to affect Meta again. I've tried to play around with the Key Repeat settings, but haven't come up with a solution using the KR4MB UI. Any suggestions? Am I going to have to abandon this pursuit altogether?
