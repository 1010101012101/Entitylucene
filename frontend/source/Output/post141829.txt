Can't bind cmd+\ to "Move focus to next window", but I can bind it to other actions... why? <body> I just reinstalled OSX 10.8, and I've encountered an incredibly odd behaviour: binding kbdcmd/kbd+kbd\/kbd to "Move focus to next window" doesn't work (if I hit it, I get the "pop" error sound). However, binding it to other actions works, and binding other combinations to that action also works.  This makes no sense to me.  I would rather keep using this shortcut, as I'm quite used to it and I hit it often.  Does someone have any clue?  P.S. in case it might help: this emdid/em work in my previous 10.8 install.  strongUpdate/strong: doesn't work in 10.10 either: I don't get the "pop" error sound anymore, but it just does nothing.  <answer142676> For what it is worth, I am able to bind kbd⌘/kbd+kbd\/kbd to strongMove Focus to Active or Next Window/strong in Mavericks, and it works fine for switching between Finder windows.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CYBLo.png" alt="move focus"  (It doesn't help your situation except to indicate that this might be a bug...)  If you are trying to use it in another application besides the Finder, does the standard kbd⌘/kbd+kbd`/kbd work?  I have the strongFull Keyboard Access/strong option below that set to text boxes only:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7qIYc.png" alt="keyboard access"  EDIT: Reassigning kbd⌘/kbd+kbd\/kbd to "Move focus to next window" also works fine for me.  You are probably onto something with the backslash causing the problem, since codedefaults write -globalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Move focus to next window" '@\'/code gives an error codeCould not parse: "@\".  Try single-quoting it./code and trying to escape it with a backslash results in a strange dictionary assignment:   precode$ defaults read -globalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents {     "Move focus to next window" = "@\\\\"; } /code/pre  <comment168048> What keyboard-layout are you using? It does work on a german keyboard just FYI <comment168049> @KevinGrabher I've noticed the German layout has `^` in place of `\\`, so maybe that's why it works? I'm using [a custom-made layout](https://github.com/Lohoris/IT4), but it doesn't work even with plain Italian layout neither with plain Japanese layout, so the layout itself isn't the problem. <comment168051> Not a true answer, but might [KeyCue](http://www.ergonis.com/products/keycue/) help? Does using the other Command key have the same effect? If you key Command then use Character Viewer to click the on-screen \ key, does that allow the Command-\ shortcut to used where required? <comment168219> Doesn't work in the Finder either. If I select US layout and set kbd⌘/kbd+kbd`/kbd as combination it works, **but** as I said it works anyway with any other combination which isn't that one. "Text boxes" only selected here too. <comment168232> The custom layout still seems suspect to me, since it works on other layouts. Command back tick is  a default for window switching in most apps, without any mods. Does that work in your layout before assigning it? <comment168245> But as I said it doesn't work in other standard layouts either. It's the backslash who is causing the problems, for some reason. Can I maybe edit the keybindings via text file, just to check they are escaping them correctly? <comment168447> I've just noticed: I don't care about "Move focus to active or next window", though it doesn't work either. I care about "Move focus to next window". It's a different command. <comment168610> I've run `defaults write -globalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Move focus to next window" "@\\\\"`, and now `defaults read -globalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents` returns `"Move focus to next window" = "@\\\\";`, but it still doesn't work...
