How do I provision a Apple device using Apples Member Center (new interface update 4/6/2013) <body> So it seems like Apple updated the member center, and I'm having a hard time trying to add a device to one of my current provisioning profiles.   Previously it was possible to do this by clicking on the provisioning profile, and then selecting "edit" where you would have a list of all your devices and can add whichever ones you'd like to the provisioning profile.   After the member center update (4/6/2013), when you select on the "provisioning profile" there is no location where your devices are listed &amp; can be added to that profile as it was setup before. I need to add a device to the provisioning profile to export and then import into testflight for testing &amp; distribution.  I know this is possible through Xcode, but I'd like to do this the through Member Center (if it's still possible)   Thanks, Russell Bradley  <comment103109> Hello Russell, and welcome to AskDifferent!
