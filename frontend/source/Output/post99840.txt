Do any iOS Email Clients allow the folders to expand/collapse like Outlook? <body> I have a 12+ gb exchange account, with hundreds of files &amp; sub files.   The iOS mail client doesn't allow the folders to collapse &amp; expand, which makes searching for files a real PITA.   Are there any mail clients that have the expand/collapse feature?  <answer99872> The best folder management app for email I have used is eMailGanizer Pro.     Folders   liExpand/Collapse style folder navigation   liFind folders by searching   liAdd, move, rename, &amp; delete folders   liOff-line operation for later synchronization   liUniversal Inbox, Unread, &amp; other 'Smart' folders   liShow all folders/labels for email/li   <answer146213> I also need this facility and just purchased " Emailganizer Pro. " It does expand and collapse folders... Can not say how thankful I am to have found this app.  Just wish they did an iPad version, but at least I can now use email on my phone.
