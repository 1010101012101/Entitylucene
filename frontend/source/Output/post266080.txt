Can't open application from unidentified developer <body> I'm using macOS Sierra and I can't open an application because it's from an unidentified developer. I went into my Security and Privacy settings and clicked on "open anyway" but strongit still doesn't let me/strong open the app. How do I open an app from an "unidentified developer"?  <answer267479> Go to System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General Look for "Allow applications downloaded from" and set it to Anywhere  Hope this helps!  <answer267555> There's a terminal command for this.

I'm not on Sierra yet, so I hope someone else knows <comment335615> That's how it's done on Sierra.  I have Sierra and it works every time for me if I right-click and select Open. <comment335619> In Sec & Priv, you've selected "Allow apps downloaded from:" **Anywhere** ? <comment335620> @WayfaringStranger MacOS Sierra does not have the "Anywhere" option. <comment335621> @narawagames My copy of Sierra does. Are you running as Admin? That might make a difference. <comment335627> @WayfaringStranger Yes, I am admin. <comment335745> The item "Anywhere" is only visible in Sierra after entering `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
