Bash history is not remembered in Terminal <body> My Bash history is remembered when I connect to my Mac via SSH, use iTerm2 or launch codebash/code in the built-in Terminal app (every command I typed in codebash/code is saved) but is not when I just use the built-in Terminal app. I already tried resetting the profiles in Terminal. I also checked ownership and permissions of code.bash_history/code. Later I also tried to delete this file. This answer didn't help either. My default shell definitely is codebash/code.  <answer221542> Begin isolating the source of the problem by removing any customizations of Bash’s history. For example, any code that sets shell variables that begin with codeHIST/code, or uses codeset -o/code to set either the codehistory/code or codehistexpand/code shell options.  The per-session command history code in code/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal/code attempts to maintain compatibility with Bash’s history variables, and tries to detect when the user is probably doing something it can’t be compatible with and disables the mechanism in that case (because the user is doing something arbitrary, like loading, saving or modifying the history). However, if you have scripts that run the codehistory/code command, that code has no way of knowing in advance; you’ll need to either update your code to maintain compatibility with the new per-session command history, or disable the per-session history by setting codeSHELL_SESSION_HISTORY=0/code as described in the documentation in code/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal/code.  If you’re not customizing codeHISTFILE/code, codeHISTTIMEFORMAT/code or the codehistappend/code shell option, another thing to check is if your shell startup script(s) modify either codePROMPT_COMMAND/code variable or the codeEXIT/code trap without concatenating the previous value to avoid wiping it out.  See the comments in code/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal/code for a description of how the mechanism works and how to customize or disable it.  <answer221805> See this answer from a similar question. El Capitan made some changes whereby it tries to do session-dependent history. You can likely fix your problem just by running codetouch ~/.bash_sessions_disable/code to create a flag file to disable this behaviour.  <comment267426> Without further details, this could be a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/50649/how-to-make-bash-terminal-app-remember-history-of-previous-sessions (linked on top as well), http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/139807/what-does-update-terminal-cwd-do-in-the-terminal-of-os-x or one of the other similar questions here. Why don't you either try the suggestions in the answers to the linked questions or edit more details about your detailed setup and what you've already tried into the question? <comment267437> @patrix Sorry about that. I already tried the suggestions in the question now linked above before posting this question. I added more information to my question. <comment267438> Found a solution. I would have added it as an answer, if this question hadn't been locked. I had to create the following file ~/.bash_sessions_disable in order to disable behaviour introduced in El Capitan. http://superuser.com/questions/950403/bash-history-not-preserved-between-terminal-sessions-on-mac <comment267443> The question’s not actually locked as far as I can tell. So I think you should be able to post your answer here (and if you do, I’ll upvote it, because while there’s already an answer for it a SuperUser, there isn’t one here at Ask Different yet).
