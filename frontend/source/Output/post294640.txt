Transferred songs from iTunes don't show on iPod nano <body> I transferred a bunch of songs from my song list on my PC to my iTunes app on my PC. Then plugged in my Nano into my PC. Transferred the songs from the iTunes app to the Nano. It shows that the songs are on the Nano, however, when I look at the Nano, none of the songs show up. What am I doing wrong or not understanding here?
