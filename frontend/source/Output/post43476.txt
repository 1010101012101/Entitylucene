Unknown Error Occurred (-54) Enabling iTunes Match <body> I just added my Apple ID to a new MacBook Pro and tried to turn on iTunes Match.  This is the error I get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W54Tw.png" alt="iTunes Match Error"  The only info I can find indicates this is a connection error, but I can connect to other areas of the iTunes Store.  Any ideas how I can resolve this?  <answer43832> Check out this video and see if it solves your problem. The intro is annoying, but I hope it helps.  <answer43902> It's a strongpermissions denied/strong error.   ul liAre you sure your Apple ID hasn't been linked to more  then 5 devices? /li liHave you tried to log out- and in again?/li liHas iTunes Match worked before?/li /ul  <answer44900> According to this discussion or this one it seems (-54) is a file-lock problem. The proposed solutions are:  ul lian AppleScript to remove locks       Open the Script Editor in the /Applications/Utilities folder and run the following:br   codetell application "Finder"   set locked of every item of entire contents of folder "Music:iTunes" of home to false   end tell/code /li liuse Terminal to ensure ownership, group, and permissions are correct  ul liuse codesudo chown your-username your-filename/code if you don't own the file/folder/li liuse codesudo chgrp staff your-filename/code if it isn't set to the same group as other iTunes items/li liuse codechmod 666 your-filename/code and/or codechmod 777 your-folder-name/code to make sure everyone (and thing) can edit/li /ul/li lidisabling FileVault if used/li /ul  In particular, check the permissions on the iTunes/Download folder which is where iTunes will first attempt to download "matched" songs.  <answer156678> I just ran the standard disk utility and restored permissions on the tome which contained my iTunes library. That took about a minute and fixed the problem for me.  <comment49912> How did you arrive from -54 to *permissions denied*?  Might be worthwhile to post a link to whatever source helped you interpret that. <comment49922> No, sorry...note in my question I state that I'm using a MacBook Pro. <comment49924> Answers to your bullets:  yes I'm sure it's not, yes I've tried logging out and back in, yes for my account, but not on this computer. <comment50259> I know it's an easy shot, but how about rebooting your Mac or reinstalling iTunes? <comment51153> Seems like a valid answer so I'm accepting, but unfortunately due to corp policy I'm not able to turn off FileVault.  The AppleScript solution did not work for me either. <comment92926> chmod 666/777 is a security issue, especially in a shared/corporate environment. chmod'ing to 600/700 should be enough to avoid any permission issues for the current user.
