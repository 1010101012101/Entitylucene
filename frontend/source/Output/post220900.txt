How to sync photos from OS X iPhoto Library to Synology DS215j? <body> Can someone tell me how can I sync my photos which are in a iPhoto Library on my Mac to my DiskStation. I don't want sync the Library file, I want to sync each picture to the DiskStation. On a Windows system there is small tool which do this sync process for the pictures in the background. I am quite new to OS X and I could not figure out how this should work on a Mac.  <comment267427> What version of OS X and iPhoto are you using? <comment267485> OS X 10.9.5 and iPhoto 9.5.1
