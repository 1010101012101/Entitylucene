macOS Sierra doesn't have the crispy fonts as they used to be in earlier versions <body> First, running the following command:  precodedefaults -currentHost read -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing /code/pre  gives me back code3/code.  But the fonts nowhere look the way they used to look in earlier versions of macOS. I was using Yosemite before, and today I upgraded to Sierra. Below is the screenshot of Sublime Text editor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWvrU.png" alt="enter image description here"  They look OK in iTerm, but elsewhere - including browsers - font rendering is much worse.  So how can I make these fonts as crispy as they used to on earlier macOS/OS X versions? I guess it definitely has something to do with AppleFontSmoothing, or font anti-aliasing in general, but I have tried the many other options in this regard, that are as follows:  ol liSetting codeAppleFontSmoothing/code with and without codecurrentHost/code flag, and restarting the macbook each time I make a change to see the changes./li liRan the command codesudo atsutil databases -remove/code to remove all the user installed fonts./li liRe-installing the font that I was using to get the desired result. (Note: I was using "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono")/li liTried to change font smoothing option for specific applications like codecom.apple.terminal/code but it didn't work either./li /ol  Note: a similar question.  <answer267974> Tried clearing the Font caches? Kind of an odd issue- I'm not sure if this is gonna help, but worth a try. Maybe it needs and refresher ;)   codedefaults -currentHost delete -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing/code  codesudo atsutil databases -remove/code and reboot, and maybe it needs and refresher. Its odd since it returns a code3/code, but maybe something is wrong with your defaults.  Re-pply after rebooting codeAppleFontSmoothing -int 3/code and see if anything first without the string set, you already know that - but let keep the references for others:   codedefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 3/code   <answer268049> A way to slightly improve the sharpness of the fonts is to increase the contrast.  precodeSystem Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &gt; Increase Contrast /code/pre  <answer268058> For Sublime Text, you can add this in the global settings:  precode"font_face": "Monaco", "font_options": [     "no_antialias" ], "font_size": 13, /code/pre  Italics will look not very good though.  <answer268714> On Sierra 10.12.2 (maybe older versions too) there's a setting that seems to have an effect on fonts, system-wide (*):      AppleAntiAliasingThreshold   The default value is around 6 or 7. Apparently it defines the font size below which anti aliasing gets turned off. If you set a high value such as 40, all fonts smaller than 40 pts will not be antialiased, hence have sharp edges. This setting seems to affect multiple applications:  ul liTextEdit/li liEclipse (Java application)/li liSome GTK applications (git gui, gitk)/li liMaybe more!/li /ul  strongOpen a Terminal and type:/strong  precodedefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleAntiAliasingThreshold -int 40 /code/pre  strongThis will turn off aliasing for font rendering in many text editors./strong  You can delete this setting to revert to default.  Rather than setting a global preference, you can restrict it to some applications too (not tested by me) :  precodedefaults write org.eclipse.eclipse AppleAntiAliasingThreshold 40 /code/pre  em(*) Note: some applications have settings that may override this setting (e.g. Terminal has a Font "antialias" setting, Sublime Text has this "font_options" preference, ...)/em  <comment335853> Try turning on/off LCD Font Smoothing in system preferences? <comment336008> Tried this as well, but no result. <comment336081> On which Mac? Is it on an external display? <comment336169> @pjctech It's MacBook Pro 2012, non retina. <comment336418> Did so, but it had not effect. <comment336660> The said problem is system wide. <comment336687> All the solutions I've found while Googling around were application specific unfortunately... <comment336781> @Arslan: did you solved it? <comment337097> no it didn't solve the problem for me. The problem still exists. <comment337338> @ArslanAli: could you provide more info, maybe a screenshot and your GPU/Screen config. <comment337345> would you be more specific on what kind of screenshot? <comment337346> I can award you bounty as the time is running out, and we can keep discussing it here or on chat. What you say? <comment337347> i don't care about the bounty- but yes, we should go to the chat <comment337349> im already there but i need to bust out to work (8:30am@local time)- so ill be on and off in the chat- send you an invite to your stackoverflow account
