macOS Sierra 10.12 ghost window space <body> After installing macOS Sierra 10.12, I have started seeing these ghost windows across the top of the screen. Unfortunately they are appearing at random and I can not determine if this is the OS, a specific application, or a general bug of some kind.    Has anyone else come across this and a way to fix it without rebooting your Mac?   strongExample:/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yGJu7.jpg" alt="enter image description here" strongUpdates/strong  ul liI have tried restarting finder.../li liIt seems to occur after the screen saver is initiated but I can not confirm.../li /ul  strongPlan of Attack/strong  ul liNext time is occurs I am planning on running through all of these commands./li /ul  <answer258432> Force quit Finder.app using this method:  ul liTerminal: "killall Finder"/li /ul  or  ul lihold the Option key and right click on the Finder icon in the dock.

Just curious, these windows matches with any screen size of one of your apps? <comment323190> no, it actually looks like a space, but under the spaces across the top <comment323234> that can makes sense. when happening again check which app is exactly at position of 'ghost window', close it, and try reproduce the 'ghost window'. My best guess is: one particular app doesnt call or implement a task, that in the new API is now required. <comment323274> i have tried closing all apps, and that does nothing.  it's like a frozen space. <comment323288> Now we have agents, try quit one by one, to see if the 'ghost' disapear. <comment323369> which agents are you referring to? <comment323425> Caffeine, Dropbox, Creative cloud manager... Apps on menu bar.
