View thumbnail cache in OS X <body> Is it possible to somehow see the cached files by QuickLook?  I have found that some data is stored in  precode/private/var/folders/xx/xxxxxxx/x/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache /code/pre  In here I found a index.sqlite which lists the path of the file (where it was when viewed) and a fs_id which looks like:  precode/.file/id=1234567.123 /code/pre  And then I got stuck...  Can I find this cache file somehow and view it ?  <answer137127> thumbnail-cache will be random, it will always have the name strongcom.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/strong. So i think you have already found the right location.   There you find the strongindex.sqlite/strong file is a SQLite database-file containing two tables: emthumbnails and files/em.   The files table contains the name, path, file-identifier, and volume-identifier of each file tracked by the database.   The emthumbnails table/em contains information about each thumbnail, including the file to which it relates (as stored in the files table) and the offset of its data, which is strongstored as a raw bitmap/strong in the thumbnails.data file.   may this will solve your question, because all of the Infos are from this Page.  <comment162861> Thank you. I read that earlier. The image data seems to be in the thumbnails.data file. So I guess I need to read that file and slice out the appropriate portions of it. <comment162862> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment162863> I will extend my answer soon.done mow :)
