Migrate Mac to Mac with external iTunes & iPhoto <body> I've got an iMac with 2 external hard drives. One 1.5TB external hard drive for iTunes and iPhoto (750GB combined) and one 3TB external hard drive for Time Machine backups.  I want to migrate everything to my new MacBook Pro which has 512GB storage.  How can I do this? Migrate assistant won't work because there is not enough storage on my MacBook.  Or can I just plug the external hard drives into my MacBook and select them as my iTunes &amp; iPhoto library?  <answer108964> Yes, you just plugin your external hard drives and start iTunes and iPhoto with the option key hold to select your library
