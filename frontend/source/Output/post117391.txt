Using terminal to get current fan speed? <body> I would like to view the current fan speeds of my MacBook and iMac using terminal. I've found that running codespindump/code then codecat /tmp/spindump.txt | grep "Fan speed"/code will show it, but that's very slow and processor intensive. I would like a faster and more efficient way of doing it.  I'd rather not install 3rd party software, but I will if it's the only way.  Does anyone have any suggestions to how I might accomplish this?  Thanks  <answer117428> h1smcFanControl/h1  You mention in your comments having smcFanControl installed; this open source project includes the command line tool codesmc/code. You can use codesmc/code to get fan speed information via Terminal.app:  precodesmc -f /code/pre  See the smc manual page for more options.  Since Mac OS X 10.5, you need to use a third party piece of software to access the fan speed information. It appears no tool, installed by default on OS X, exposes this information through the terminal.  The open source project Fan Control includes a command line tool that provides fan speed information. This article, OS X: Current CPU temperature on command line, talks about the project and how to extract the fan speed:  precodesmc -k TC0D -r | sed 's/.*bytes \(.*\))/\1/' |sed 's/\([0-9a-fA-F]*\)/0x\1/g' | perl -ne 'chomp; ($low,$high) = split(/ /); print (((hex($low)*256)+hex($high))/4/64); print "C\n";' /code/pre  h2Avoid spindump/h2  codespindump/code requires administrator privileges and when run manually, spindump samples user and kernel stacks for every process in the system. This is a computationally expensive process, even when run for one second.  h2Alternatives/h2  Other tools and applications exist, including Temperature Monitor. See Can I get the CPU temperature and fan speed from the command line in OS X?  h2Pre-Mac OS X 10.5/h2  This article, get sensor information, shows how to use codeioreg/code to extract the fan speed information with:  precodeioreg -c IOHWSensor | grep -B3 -A11 '"type" = "fanspeed"' /code/pre  The above article and the script it contains was designed for Mac OS X 10.4.3.

The "wudo" should bring you to air flow and pressure which you can go through the menus that can show you the air flow in terminal. This worked very well for me, and I hope you enjoy it too!  <comment137685> Point is, as of Mavericks, Apple does not provide a way to query SMC-managed information. Thus, best way would to use smcFanControl, which actually is way more than just a fac control. <comment137708> I do use smcFanControl, but is there any way of accessing its information from terminal? That's what I'm most interested in. <comment137711> You can use smcFanControl's `smc` command line tool to get the fan speed; https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl/tree/master/smc-command <comment137822> You are almost there. spindump has a manpage (`man spindump`) and you can set the time it needs to run. Answer is below. <comment137923> Bresink's Temperature Monitor (which I use) is free for reading temperature, but needs a license to read other sensors (e.g. fan speed). <comment137954> I'm running 10.8.5 on an iMac and my spindump report doesn't include any mention of "Fan speed" or even "fan". <comment137983> I am running 10.9.1. I cannot find my 'version' of spindump, but my fan speed is in the first 20 lines. <comment138089> are you on a laptop or desktop? <comment138171> @aaaidan I am running a Mac Mini (Hardware model: Macmini5,3) and an MBP retina (Hardware model: MacBookPro11,1). Both have the variable "Fan speed" in their output. <comment138182> Not finding this reliable. on my Macbook I have to take out the Touch part for it to work but then the rm does not work. Also if I run: `sudo spindump 1 1 -file /tmp/spindump.txt  /dev/null 2&1;grep "Fan speed" /tmp/spindump.txt` One try it works next try it does not <comment138194> @markhunte, I had the same issues. I hope my last update fixes your problem. <comment138218> It did fix it cheers. Shame there does not seem to be a way to pipe the stdout from spindump to stdin <comment149044> I don't see the "Fan speed" string either. OS X 10.6 on an iMac. <comment149045> Incidentally, I want the fan speed because at times the fan is getting loud... <comment149475> @Michael, for you http://www.eidac.de might work: smcFanControl <comment222829> It is good, but works only via command line, to find application go to: `cd /Applications/smcFanControl.app/Contents/Resources/` <comment241518> In the question, he says he does not want to do this exact thing. <comment241693> Plus the question was answered fully last year. <comment242741> `brew install Caskroom/cask/smcfancontrol` and using it also requires password. <comment322119> I'd like to add my voice to @Spotlight's. <comment327716> `-bash: sudo_wudo: command not found`. Same problem with `sudo wudo`, is this a command which needs to be installed first?
