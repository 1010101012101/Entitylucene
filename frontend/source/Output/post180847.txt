Wrong date format in the menu bar <body> I set up some custom date formats, and while at first the date in the menu bar did honor them, now I've noticed it stopped and it's just using a standard one.  How do I switch it back?  Screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8lqCX.png" alt="screenshot"  If I click on it, it shows it using my custom format, but that's infinitely pointless.  I'm running code10.10.3/code, IIRC I updated yesterday (from a code10.10.?/code, likely the one just before this one), but I'm not sure it's emthis/em update who broke it.  <answer181635> This is the new behaviour in Yosemite and it can't easily be changed. The menu bar format now doesn't read your custom format and instead displays a barely customizable format instead. The only available options for it can be found in codeSystem Preferences/code - codeDate &amp; Time/code - codeClock/code.  One thing you could do is use a third party utility like codeDay-O/code, which is free and does exactly what you seek - http://shauninman.com/archive/2011/10/20/day_o_mac_menu_bar_clock.  If you want things more natively, you could try editing the corresponding codeplist/code file directly (codecom.apple.menuextra.clock/code). I haven't however had much luck with it.  Open codeTerminal/code and type the following:  Reading the current settings:  precodedefaults read com.apple.menuextra.clock /code/pre  Setting them:  precodedefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock "DateFormat" 'EEE hh:mm a' /code/pre  Or 24 hours format with the (day of the) month and seconds:  precodedefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock "DateFormat" 'EEE d MMM HH:mm:ss' /code/pre  Then refresh the menu bar using:  precodekillall -KILL SystemUIServer /code/pre  Using codew/code you should be able to add week number, but I haven't had any luck with that and it keeps resetting the week number.  <comment216014> Please show how you set it up <comment216018> does my answer here help? http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/181508/85275 <comment216021> @Tetsujin no, thanks. That's exactly what I have done and _do not_ work anymore. It works on other places, just not on the menu bar. <comment216028> Have you manage to get the `year` in there. `y MMMM dd` <comment216161> `Day-0` is working, thanks! I'll wait a few days, just in case it breaks, but if it doesn't you'll get the bounty! I'm a bit perplexed by its author claiming he "won't update it for Yosemite", since it actually seem to work anyway… <comment216163> It is mainly support for dark mode that it is lacking. If you don't use dark mode or aren't bothered by a weird UI in dark mode you should be fine. <comment216800> For the record, now I'm using `yyyy-MM-dd, HH:mm • e/'w' – qqq,w`.
