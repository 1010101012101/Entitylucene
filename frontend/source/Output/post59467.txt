Cannot connect to Apple file servers after upgrading to 10.8 <body> Since I can't find thousands of other users reporting this I'm thinking it's got to be something wrong with my system, but after I updated to Mountain Lion I can't connect to Apple file servers anymore.  Not even a Drobo FS.  The servers still show up in my sidebar but they never successfully connect.  I tried creating a new user and connecting from that one, but still had the same problem.  The OSX servers are running 10.6 &amp; 10.7.  Really? No one else is having this problem?  <answer59529> It seems that obsolete iDisk settings in OSX 10.8 may prevent you to connect to a file server.  You need to run those commands in Terminal   pre defaults delete -g iToolsMember defaults delete -g iToolsMemberDomain /pre  to get rid of those settings.
