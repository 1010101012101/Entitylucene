How can I do a "git push" to remote with the gui gitx tool? <body> I come from linux and gitg.  That allows me to do the codegit pull/code and codegit push/code to the remote using the graphical gitg tool with a right-click option.  However the gitx tool doesn't seem to have this functionality.  Can I pull/push using gitx or do I have to use the command tool? I couldn't find anything on the screen: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6nZIH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer59174> Given no good answer in the past week - probably the product just doesn't have it -the "answer" for me was to start using the free SourceTree visual git tool.br It's amazing.  Once again gui tools have stepped up to another level.
