How do I remove Podcasts from IOS Podcast app <body> I've been using the IOS Podcast app and I'm trying to remove podcast from it. I had subscribed to a podcast, but now I unsubscribed and deleted the episodes. It still shows up in my podcast menu though. How do I remove it from the list of my podcasts?

Also, what happens when you try to swipe-and-delete directly from "my podcasts" in podcast app? <comment121093> In ios7 the edit button is gone. Really not liking 7 at all <comment121094> @RobR I just checked, and the Edit button is still there in iOS 7. You have to pull down on the grid of podcasts to get it to show up. <comment185688> +1. The edit button is visible in the top left in iOS 8 on the iPhone.
