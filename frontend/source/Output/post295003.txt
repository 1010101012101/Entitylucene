iPad remote management, but not on apples DEP <body> I have a dilemma. I work for a decentralized organization with independent business units.  We’re now starting to centralize the support of IT.  I have a few companies who bought their own iPads from like Best Buy, amazon and the Apple Store. I had read that you cannot enter consumer purchased iPads into the DEP program. I have 20 iPads I want to manage and maintain, but it also seems like an Apple ID is a MUST to do literally anything. I read somewhere that an Apple ID has a max limit of 10 devices. The other problem is when I add a new iPad it sends alerts to ALL the other iPads, which could interrupt or scare a user in a different location.  My question is, how best can I manage and maintain 20+ iPads? I’m currently using InTune, but features a limited without Apples DEP and still requires an AppleID to install any apps.  <answer295056> Check out What's new in DEP from WWDC17. All devices can now be enrolled into DEP regardless of purchase source. Apple Configurator will allow you to provision any device for DEP however these device will be put into a 30 day trial period where the device will display a warning on the lock screen and can be un enrolled at any time.  <comment372696> That’s useful info. I’m glad that we can now enroll any iOS device. However, we have an entirely Windows 10 ecosystem, I can’t run configurator, and it’ll be really hard asking them to shell out ~1100 for a MacBook or something. <comment372697> If I solved your issue could you mark my answer? Thanks! <comment372698> sorry, don’t know if you saw my edit, but do you have any suggestions for a Windows based solution? <comment372699> Sorry, there's nothing out there yet. Get a used laptop or an old Mac mini. It only needs to be used for configurator however you need to be sure that it can run Sierra.
