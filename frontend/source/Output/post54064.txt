Permission denied error when copying to /usr/local/bin <body> The GitHub setup page at https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git has a section on password caching.  It states to download the osxkeychain and copy it to /usr/local/bin.  I downloaded the file, but get a permission denied error when I try to copy it to the directory specified.  How can I get this file copied?  <answer54072> You will need to use codesudo cp/code instead of just codecp/code to copy a file to code/usr/local/bin/code because code/usr/*/code is only writable for root.  <comment61874> Why the -1?  I am asking why I get a permission denied error. <comment61878> no idea. Balanced it out <comment61880> Thank you.  I am a Mac/UNIX newbie, but trying to learn.
