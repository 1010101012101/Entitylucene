Can I dock all my apps at once? <body> I'm using a Mac at my new job and I often want to have a clear view of my desktop quickly. So far I've bound the Expos√© - Desktop function to my mouse and it works okay, but the moment I want to just bring one app back from the dock, they all come back and it's frustrating.  Is there a way to show my desktop and actually put all my apps in the dock, kind of like the bottom right corner of Windows 7/8? There is this restriction that I can't install anything on my work machine. If there's nothing in Yosemite, will there be something in El Capitan?  <answer199533> From within the application that you want, just go to the application menu and click "Hide Others"(shortcut alt-cmd-H)  You can create an AppleScript and/or find third party software(like MagicPrefs) to create a shortcut for this action or an "App" in the dock that can do this.
