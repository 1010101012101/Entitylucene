How do I redeem an App Gift from a different App Store? "This code is only valid for customers of the ___ Store." <body> My friend has sent me a gift app from the Singapore App Store whilst I'm on the Australian App store.   I encounter the following: "This code is only valid for customers of the Singapore Store."  How do I redeem this?   <answer47115> Related to this question.    And the answer is, gift cards and gift certificates are redeemable only on the iTunes Store for the country for which they were purchased.   <answer47116> You can register an iTunes account that uses Singapore App Store, and download from there.
