How to share files with coworkers via internet? Securely? <body> I have number of co-workers in other countries. I would like to be able to setup something like shared network drive so that we can all access the files and work together. What's the best way of doing that? Do I need Lion server for that?  <answer20629> Why not use something like Dropbox?  There's also Sparkleshare which allows you to host files yourself.  <answer20637> OwnCloud lets you setup your own cloud server environment.  <comment22708> Or [Box.net](http://www.box.net/) <comment22713> re Securely - how secure do you need it to be? <comment22715> yeah... but I was more looking at something "in house" i.e. myself hosting the files. <comment22721> I just set it up on my computer, it works great! <comment22735> sparkleshare looks good. But when I tried to run in on my Mac (lion) it didn't work... <comment22753> Why not create a new question with whatever problem you're having. Somebody might be able to help you <comment22817> If everyone is running Lion, perhaps you can do something like AirDrop? <comment22862> Airdrop won't allow them to share files over the internet
