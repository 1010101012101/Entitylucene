Prevent iTerm2 from opening new terminal from dock <body> I just switched from TotalTerminal to iTerm2, and the feature I used the most was the visor. When I used my shortcut key (option + `), it'd drop a terminal from the top of the screen that i could tuck away with the visor shortcut again. Alternatively, if I clicked the terminal button in the dock, I could pull down the visor (or if I had other terminals open, I could go to those).  Is there a way I can have iTerm2 not open a new terminal when I click on it in the dock, but to just go to the most recent active terminal (which may be the visor)?  I'm running Mac OS Sierra (10.12.5).  <answer285017> As answered here, you can use a shortcut to hide/display open terminals.  However, I don't think you can "restore" a previous session, since when you emclose/em the iTerm2, it ends the current session.  <comment359416> I've got the shortcut to do the quake-console type thing. All I want is that when I click the iterm2 icon in the dock (when iterm2 is already running), it doesn't open a new terminal (and ideally shifts focus to the last used terminal/visor). <comment359477> So you want to use the dock icon as you use your Hotkey ? <comment359481> I have a hotkey already, and that functionality works fine. I just don't want clicking on the iterm2 icon in the dock to open a new terminal, but to open the last used terminal (which may be the visor).
