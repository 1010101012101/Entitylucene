Getting .profile to execute after .bash_login <body> When I installed RVM, it turns out that it created .bash_login with this:  code[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] &amp;&amp; source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session as a function/code  And I now have to manually source .profile, where my BASH configs are.  How do I get .profile to automatically execute?  <answer60535> ol liDelete code~/.bash_login/code/li liMove code[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] &amp;&amp; source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session as a function/code into the bottom of your code~/.profile/code./li liSuccess!/li /ol  <comment69678> Thanks!  And shell session - what's the format for that? <comment69679> Everything after the `#` is a comment, there is no specific format <comment69718> Okay, so I just copy that line and paste into the bottom of the .profile file?  Sorry, I don't have experience setting up a function so I'm not sure how to do that. <comment69770> That's correct. Just move the contents of `~/.bash_login` as-is into `~/.profile`, preferably at the bottom. Delete `~/.bash_login`. Done
