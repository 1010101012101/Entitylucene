Maximum Data Size of iMessage <body> I was wondering how big a document (picture, voice, video) can be "iMessaged" from an iPhone. Also, would the iMessage data size be any different if you are iMessaging from within Mountain Lion.   <answer59975> Extracted from Mountain Lion's Features page:     strongSend large attachments:/strong Send high-quality photos, full HD video, or documents. iMessage allows attachments of up to strong100MB/strong.   And for the iPhone, as far as I know, the limit is set by your service provider.  <answer93901> In my 8 1.5mb photos at once is the limit.  <comment110096> In your 8 what? <comment277328> Also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70645/is-there-a-limit-for-the-attachment-size-in-messages
