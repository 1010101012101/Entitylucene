Installing software on a MacBook <body> I'm switching from PC to a MacBook and wondered the best convention for installing new software.  For example, I've downloaded the Atom IDE, unzipped the 4 files and put into the /Users/userName/Applications Directory (which was empty, but seemed like a good place).  I then added the /Users/userName/Applications/Atom directory to the \etc\paths file, but when I type 'atom' from the bash prompt, it is not recognized.  How should I be installing software, is there a convention on where it goes?  Do I need to update the \etc\paths file or is there a location where exe's are picked up by the command line?  <answer144022> Generally application (code.app/code) bundles are meant to be stored in code/Applications/code of code~/Applications/code. I recommend using code/Applications/code for the vast majority of installations, since the apps there will be accessible to other users' accounts`.  Application bundles aren't directly executable. Instead, their executable file is stored within the bundle (right click and select "Show package contents"), in code{APPLICATION.app}/Contents/MacOS//code  To open an Application bundle from the terminal, you can use the wicked codeopen/code command with the code-a/code flag, like: codeopen -a /Applications/Application.app/code. This comes in handy occasionally, though I don't know why you'd want to open applications through terminal, rather than through the dock, dock stack, or spotlight.  <comment169652> Thanks, I tried the open on the Atom.app and it opened the Atom IDE, but how do I "install" Atom so it's available in Bash?  Ie. "Atom abc.erb" and open up atom.  I now type that and it doesn't recognize the keyword Atom. <comment169654> Ah, see this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22390709/open-atom-editor-from-command-line <comment169656> Doh!  Figures that the very first app I install needs an extra step. :)
