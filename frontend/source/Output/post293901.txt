App Rejected for Appstore Video <body> My app update got rejected for its preview video. The message from the reviewers asked to include content only from the app. However, the video has only content recorded in the app, some text to explain what the features are and the background music (for which we have rights to). It would be a great help if you can check the video out and let us know what to change in the video and why it really fails the review. YouTube link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FHwCyKvyoM  <comment370910> I think they are talking about the titles... just put them on top of the video of your app. At no point should there be a black screen. But more importantly it's best to ask the App Store Reviewers. They send you a message right? You can answer that message with your question. <comment370916> Hey, thanks. I sent messages multiple times to the reviewers. Their answers were really not helpful and were inconsistent too, at one point asking me to remove the voice over while the video has none. Why we did the video this way was we saw videos like what we have on the appstore. For example this here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tempo-training-log-for-runners/id1106746589?mt=8. But, as you said, I will try to do something by removing the text.
