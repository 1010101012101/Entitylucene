Can I move the OS X that was preinstalled on my MacBook pro to a VM running on the MacBook Pro? <body> I would like to run linux as the primary operating system on my MacBook Pro to replace the OS X that was pre-installed with the MacBook.  I would then like to run OS X inside a virtualbox guest running on the MacBook.  ol liIs this configuration legal from a licensing perspective?/li liMy mac book was pre-installed and there wasn't an installation CD in the box.  How can I get the OS X installation image for installing into Virtualbox?/li /ol  UPDATE: I have NOT purchased a copy of OS X, and I do not wish to purchase one either :)  <answer167372> You could try to download the Yosemite installer (or another OSX version if your "purchased" it earlier) and try if you can install a virtual machine with it. You could also visit this link (it is for parallels, but maybe it will also work with virtual box): http://kb.parallels.com/en/118806  <answer167538> You should be able to see the yosemite installer in the AppStore. Follow the instructions here to create a bootable disk for yosemite (os x 10.10). Similar instructions can be found for mavericks or older versions with a simple google search.   Then format the harddrive and install linux.  Then download vmware or your preferred vm client and set up the vm using your bootable disk.  <comment196213> Why not use bootcamp to install linux and set that as your startupdrive? On newer macbooks there aren't any installation discs required, because they normally have a recovery partition. <comment196219> I will probably need to regularly switch between Linux and OS X.   It looks like bootcamp is a dualboot mechanism which will make switching between OS's a pain? <comment196284> Thanks for the response.  However, I've updated the question to reflect that purchasing a copy of OS X is not something I want to do. <comment196285> By purchasing I mean that an os x version is linked to your apple id. OSX Maverics and OSX Yosemite are both free to download fron the appstore.
