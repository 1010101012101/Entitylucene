Where does Mail keep its configuration files? <body> I had to replace my hard drive and don't have a backup. I do have a copy of my home folder on an external disk but it was a simple copy/paste job.  I've been dragging my stuff from that disk to my new drive but I don't know where to look for Mail.app account configuration data. I need to recover the server name, username and password for one of my accounts.  <answer125801> Mail.app stores server credentials in your login keychain. You will find your login keychain in: code~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain/code  Copy, rename, and open this keychain file with strongKeychain Access/strong. Keychain Access is included with Mac OS X in the strongApplications  Utilities/strong folder.  Within the Keychain Access application, search for your mail server using the search field at the top-right.  To retrieve a password, double-click on the item and enable strongShow password:/strong.  <answer125847> I found the file with the account list under  code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist/code  It seems to hold all sorts of metadata related to accounts but if you go through it you'll find things like server names and ports.  <answer224095> I had a similar problem, with a twist.  I have some Comcast accounts, and found that they had recently upgraded from POP3 to IMAP. So I had to delete these on my various devices, and re-add them. For some reason, on one of my devices (Macbook Pro, El Capitan), iCloud did not propagate these new accounts, but when I tried to add them manually, I got this error message.  What solved it was:  ol liLogging out of iCloud/li liRemoving all mentions of accounts from keychain /li lilogging in with iCloud./li /ol  I don't know if step 2 is required, but it's what I did.  Then when I logged back in, iCloud propagated the accounts.
