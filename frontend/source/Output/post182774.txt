How do I remove songs from my iPhone 5s running IOS 8.3? <body> There is a U2 album on my iPhone which I didn't download &amp; isn't on my Mac &amp; I am unable to remove it.  I deleted all Music app storage from the phone, then re-synched with 1 playlist from iTunes on the Mac, but the album still appears on the phone under genres, artists &amp; albums but not playlists.   <answer182782> Yes, what you need to do is go into settings on the iPhone, then iTunes &amp; App Store, and disable Automatic Downloads of Music.   Apple applied the U2 album to everyones account so if u have this option turned on, then it auto downloads.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0clU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment217704> This answer may help: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/137159/38539.
