Corrupted USB flash drive, cannot initialise or mount <body> I have a USB flash drive which seems to be very corrupted. I didn't have any important files on it so I'm not trying to recover files, I just want to get the drive working again. First, whenever I insert the drive, I get this window. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Af4k2.png" alt="enter image description here" I press codeinitialize.../code and I go into Disk Utility. However, Disk Utility says the USB drive is still unmounted. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nr0Wb.png" alt="enter image description here" As you can see I cannot press mount at all. Erasing gives me this error.  Erase process has failed. Press Done to continue.  codeUnmounting disk Wiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed. Operation failed... /code  Help would be very appreciated. Is this drive broken or can I bring it back to life? :)  <comment366852> tbh, they're not worth the effort once they start to play up.
