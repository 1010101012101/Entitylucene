Unable to add outlook account after updating to ios10 <body> After updating my iPhone to IOS 10 yesterday, I am unable to add an outlook account.  So here's what I'm doing:  ul liI go to settings-mail-accounts, then tap "add account", and select "outlook". /li liA pop-up appears which loads Microsoftâ€™s login page. I enter my username and password there, and click "login"./li liThe page then asks me for a code from the two-step verification app. I enter that code and press "confirm" (or whatever the button is called)./li liAfter that another page appears which says that I am about to grand the following permissions (access to mail, contacts, etc.) to IOS, and asks me to confirm that./li liI press "Yes", and then this window simply dissapears, leaving me back at the screen with mail provider selection (the one with "outlook", "exchange", "google", etc on it)./li /ul  The outlook account is never added to my phone. However if I login to my outlook account from my PC and go to security settings-permissions, I can see that the permission for "IOS" emhas/em been created properly, it's just that the account is never added to my phone for some reason. Is there a way to fix this somehow?  <answer252871> Use Exchange instead of Outlook as mail provider. It offers exactly the same functions, including push notifications. Create a new app password in your Outlook account security settings for login.  <answer253729> I had a similar problem with a gmail adress. It was not able to add the account because it was not safari set as the browser used to open link from outlook app
