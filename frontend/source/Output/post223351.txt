Installing Julia using Brew <body> It appears that codebrew/code does not have a Julia formula. This is quite surprising to me, am I missing something?  Apparently there's a codebrew tap/code that can be used instead (staticfloat/julia). Before going for that solution I wanted to know if that's supposed to be the most straightforward way to do so.  <answer223354> You can install Julia using codecask/code:  precode$ brew cask install julia /code/pre  hr  precode$ brew cask info julia julia: 0.4.2 Julia http://julialang.org/ Not installed https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/julia.rb ==&gt; Contents   Julia-0.4.2.app (app)   Julia-0.4.2.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia (binary) /code/pre  <comment293713> The reason the only julia formula you will find is in a tap right now is because Julia has, historically, had pretty strict version requirements on dependencies such as LLVM.  Homebrew likes to provide only the most recent version of formulae, and as Julia 0.4 still uses LLVM 3.3, this poses a problem for a mainline Homebrew Julia formula.  There is the Homebrew/versions tap that has older versions of LLVM available, but by that time, you are no better off than just having a tap dedicated to Julia.  The cask approach also works, as long as you don't need to custom compile anything.
