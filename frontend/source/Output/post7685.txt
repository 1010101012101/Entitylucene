How to fix a file that's read-only despite showing correct permissions <body> A file copied from a NTFS share has become read-only, other files in the same folder are OK.  Finder's Info says in the Sharing &amp; Permissions:  precodeYou can only read  Name        Privilege  myname (Me) Read &amp; Write  admin       Read only  everyone    Read only /code/pre  ls -l@  precodetotal 142040 -rwxr-xr-x  1 myname admin  5388424 Sep 17  1998 Bad File -rwxr-xr-x  1 myname admin  3534780 Feb  3 21:36 Good File /code/pre  How to undo? chown/chmod didn't do anything...  <answer7686> Try codels -lO/code to see if any file flags are set.  If it's locked (uchg flag), you can unlock it in either the Finder's Get Info window, or with codechflags nouchg "Bad File"/code.  If some other flag is set, use codechflags no&lt;whatever&gt; "Bad File"/code to clear it.  EDIT: The code-O/code flag to la adds another column between the group and size of the files, listing file flags (if any).  Note that flags are entirely separate from extended attributes (what code-@/code displays).  Here's an example:  precode$ touch "Normal File" "Locked File" "Invisible, Append-only File" $ chflags uchg "Locked File" $ chflags uappnd,hidden "Invisible, Append-only File" $ ls -l total 0 -rw-r--r--@ 1 gordon  wheel  0 Feb  4 07:24 Invisible, Append-only File -rw-r--r--  1 gordon  wheel  0 Feb  4 07:24 Locked File -rw-r--r--  1 gordon  wheel  0 Feb  4 07:24 Normal File $ ls -lO total 0 -rw-r--r--@ 1 gordon  wheel  uappnd,hidden 0 Feb  4 07:24 Invisible, Append-only File -rw-r--r--  1 gordon  wheel  uchg          0 Feb  4 07:24 Locked File -rw-r--r--  1 gordon  wheel  -             0 Feb  4 07:24 Normal File /code/pre  The uchg flag is what gets set if you check the "Locked" box in a file's Get Info window.  BTW, the "hidden" flag only affects the Finder -- the only way to hide files from the command line is to put a . at the front of the filename.  <answer7751> Another method of unlocking said file would be in Finder itself.  Under the General expansion of Get Info.  This toggles the uchg flag.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqTkD.png" alt="Get Info Box"  <comment8321> What type of file is it?  How do you know it is read-only? <comment8322> Dunno if that's going to fix his problem but good answer nonetheless +1 <comment8357> I try to edit it, or change its properties/permissions in the Finder, and it doesn't let me. In addition, "You can only read" in Finder's Info is a hint as well. <comment8358> The file was indeed locked. Could you please expand on how to identify the uchg flag in the ls output?
