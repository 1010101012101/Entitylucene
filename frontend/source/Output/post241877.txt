Getting input from a Sony PS3 Dualshock controller <body> I have Playstation 3 Dualshock controller, which was successfully paired to my Mac running El Capitan. When I open my Bluetooth settings, I can see it appearing as codePLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller/code.  When I open apps like emControllerMate/em, emEnjoy2/em, emEnjoyable/em, or emOpenEMU/em  I can see my controller appearing in the menu.  But strongno matter what I do/strong I can't get any application to register my button presses. What am I doing wrong? It seems like it should be so easy.  EDIT:  What's even stranger: When I try to connect via USB, the controller behaves different depending on the application. In Safari, the analog buttons will print codep/code, codel/code, coder/code, codeo/code, depending if I press left, up, right or down.  In OpenEMU only the square and the R1 button work. However when I press one of these, every other button will work as well, but only If I simultaneously press the square button or R1. As soon as I let go of the square or R1 button, the other one will keep its current status (codepressed/code or codenot pressed/code). What is this madness?
