Customise Touch Bar for a specific application <body> So I've been using the MacBook Pro with Touch bar for a week and the Touch Bar seems pretty convenient. However, I haven't found an option to customize the Touch Bar for a specific app.  For example, whenever I code via jetBrains phpStorm, I'm used to having the codeF[0-12] Buttons/code (which aren't displayed in the keyboard anymore in favor of the Touch Bar). I know that if I'm holding the codefn/code button, I'll be able to see the codeF[0-12] Buttons/code. But I want them to be displayed by default without the need to hold the codefn/code button.  Is there a way I can achieve this?  <answer283570> Assuming I understand your question, you can set your Touch Bar to show the function keys as its default display on an app by app basis.  To do this:  ol liGo to strongApple  System Preferences/strong/li liSelect the strongKeyboard/strong preference pane/li liClick on the strongShortcuts/strong tab/li liIn the left sidebar, select the strongFunction Keys/strong option/li liOn the right-hand side click on the plus kbd+/kbd button/li liSelect the JetBrains PhpStorm app/li liAdd the app/li /ol  Now, whenever you are using the JetBrains PhpStorm app, the Touch Bar should display all the function keys.  <answer283609> If you want to REALLY customize your Touch Bar, you'll need BetterTouchTool.  There is a short post on the official BTT site, linking to a long blog post on medium.com illustrating Touch Bar customization using BTT.  hr  In the interest of link rot prevention, here are a couple of Touch Bar screenshots from the blog post.

Thanks! <comment357647> This is close to being a duplicate of [this question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/261456/209426). However, the answers here are good, so it probably shouldn't be closed. <comment357663> +1 Agreed! Using BTT is an excellent way to do advanced customisations of the Touch Bar. There are other options, but BTT is the leader of the pack, although I've noticed for some it takes a while to suss it out. But it's definitely worth it when they do! :)
