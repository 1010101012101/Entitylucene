Disabling preview column in Finder for specific folders only <body> Finder has this View option (CMD+J) that lets you disable the preview column but this is a global setting and I am aiming to disable it only for specific folders. Is this possible?  <comment312055> The Hide/Show Preview command on the View menu in Finder is, as you already know, a global setting and is not available for individual folders.
