iCloud Mail doesn't load, but all other iCloud services work fine <body> I've been having this weird problem with iCloud for a while.  If I go to codeicloud.com/code, I can login just fine, and everything works (Contacts, Calendars, etc.), EXCEPT the Mail app. Whenever I click the Mail Icon, I get this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rRjfK.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I click "Report to Apple" it gives a more detailed log, ending with this message:  precodeSat, 24 Dec 2011 04:13:07 GMT:  ERROR: CoreMail handled error 13002 before exiting Mail /code/pre  Anybody know how to fix this?  By the way, whenever I try to login to Mail in the Mac OS X Mail.app or the iPhone mail, I get codeThe iCloud IMAP server “p06-imap.mail.me.com” rejected the password for user “myusernamehere” /code, even though the password is correct.  <answer34863> It seems it was a temporary problem, as it now appears fixed.  <comment42941> Not quite fixed yet because I'm getting the same error <comment42947> @Phillip: you're not the first to post that here. In my experience iCloud email is just too flaky for actual use right now, I stopped using iCloud for email.
