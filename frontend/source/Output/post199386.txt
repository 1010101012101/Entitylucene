Graphics driver for Macbook Pro Retina BootCamp and AMD M370x <body> Has anyone had any luck finding a BootCamp driver to work for the new 2015 MacBook Pro Retina with AMD m370x?  I've installed Windows 8.1, but the AMD driver installation tool says that there is no suitable hardware available, even though it clearly shows up display properties.  Maybe there is a Beta driver somewhere?  Why would there be terrible performance out of the gate for this video card, when it should be an upgrade from previous gen?  <answer199430> Have you run the AMD driver setup from your codeWININSTALL/code flash drive? That should do it for you.  To find the setup file, open Windows File Explorer, and then go to codeD:\BootCamp\Drivers\AMD\AMDGraphics\Setup.exe/code. Remember to replace codeD/code with the correct disk that codeWININSTALL/code is on.
