Is it possible to install both Xcode 3 and 4 side-by-side, alternate use either one or the other  <body> I've got a handle on how to install Xcode 3 and 4 on the same machine (running OS X &lt; 10.7), so I'm looking more how to manage this environment.  Rather: is it possible to enter some shell command to "point" to the Xcode version you would like to use for a certain task?  For example, some packages in Homebrew seem to have issues with Xcode 4 compilers (multiple code-arch/code flags not supported any longer etc.). So, when I want to codebrew install/code something, I would like to use the old Xcode 3 gcc suite. But when doing actual Cocoa development, I  would rather like to use Xcode 4.  RVM also does a nice job of managing work in multiple environments. I think, newer Linux distributions offer a tool called update-alternatives to achieve such a goal. Just to give you more of an idea of what I am talking about.  Similar to running both simultaneously except I'm looking to use them sequentially.  <answer22455> I believe you can only have one version of the command-line tools installed at the same time, and I believe it says this during the installation process, so you won't really be able to switch between them.  <comment24963> Forgive the heavy handed edit. I wanted to emphasize how detailed you crafted this to avoid any confusion with the linked question. <comment24965> This might be manageable with shell functions to automate changes to $PATH - Xcode 4 now drops it's command line in `/Developer/usr/bin` ([see this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21500/is-there-a-second-step-needed-to-activate-the-command-line-tools-in-xcode-4)) If @stamineus installs Xcode 3 smartly, they might coexist much nicer than the named applications Like Xcode and Instruments will as they are likely to fight over who opens the same UTI / file type. <comment25174> No prob, thanks for the effort. And thanks for the pointer to RVM, might be useful in the future. <comment25175> OK, +1 for the info, although it being a disappointing one. If there won't turn up any positive solutions, I will accept this as an answer. <comment25176> @bmike: It does look like I have stuff in `/Developer/usr/bin`, but I also have it in `/usr/bin` (I do also happen to have Xcode 3 installed; maybe that's why) and `/Developer/usr/bin` isn't in my `$PATH`...
