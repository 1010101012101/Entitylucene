How to stop my SSD "ejecting" from my iMac when in standby? <body> I recently purchased an SSD drive for my 2009 27" iMac to replace the DVD Drive.  Everything installed fine, performance is good etc. emHowever/em when the device (SSD) is put to "sleep", OS X sees it as ejected, and strongwill not/strong see it again until I pull the power from the iMac. Shutting down does not seem to help -- nor does restarting.  Things I've tried:  ol liReset the NVRAM -- after this it did show up without pulling the power, but then it disappeared again after going to slee[/li liresetting the SMC/li liPulling the drive, and completely reseating it in case something wasn't quite installed right/li /ol  None of which seemed to have helped. Support from the vendor suggested "Turn off sleeping of the hard disks". This seems poor since it leaves the HDD that is still in there spinning. Additionally, surely it's going to go to sleep when it goes to standby for the whole Mac.  Any suggestions/Thoughts?  <answer236354> have a look at:  http://www.mac-forums.com/apple-notebooks/273332-2nd-internal-hard-drive-ejects-sleep.html  It seems to be the caddy.  <comment254367> If you go look at it in Disk Utility does it say it is Ejectable. <comment254690> Nope -- sees it as non-ejectable & a solid state. <comment289254> Welcome to Ask Different!
