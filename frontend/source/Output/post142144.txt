Shortcut to accept top spelling suggestion of the last word <body> Say I'm typing into a document and I make a typo. I've got to the end of the misspelled word and it has a red line of dots under it. I right click and choose the top suggestion (which is nearly always right) and continue writing my document.  It there a way to do this without using the mouse to choose the suggestion?  EDIT: I don't have auto correct spelling on as it's a massive pain. There are a lot of words that I don't want to have corrected. So I have it turned off. However there are regularly ones that I do want to correct and I want to be able to take a chance at correcting that last misspelled word.  I know that this cannot be done with the default OSX settings.  <answer142163> strongEdit:/strongbr If you want it to be automatically corrected, go to strongSystem preferences  Keyboard  Text/strong and turn on "Correct spelling automatically".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fo22H.png" alt="Keyboard settings pane"  hr  emOriginal answer:/em       Which OS X version are you on?      I'm on Mavericks and if I move the cursor so it touches the misspelled word, the suggestion pops up automatically and I can chose the correct one using the arrow keys.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ppd44.png" alt="Screenshot of text suggestion"   <comment167526> I don't want to have to choose the suggestion. I'd like to have a command that behaved like Google's I'm Feeling Lucky option and just corrected it to the first most likely option. <comment167609> Not sure if OS X version older than Mavericks have the setting, but you can turn on `Correct spelling automatically` under Keyboard settings.
