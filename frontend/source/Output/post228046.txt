How to make terminal maximize at open? <body> By right clicking its icon, I can make terminal.app "Open at Login". But I want to maximize the terminal window when it's opened. So it will be very cool when I login: Imagine an OS X without GUI! (at least it seems so.)  Any advice?  <answer228052> If you go to Preference inside Terminal, then inside Profiles and then Window you can set the default windows size.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lDwh5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Knowing that you are setting the size for the default window, every time you open it all the default settings will be applied.  <comment277998> Graphics is what makes OS X cool :)  for no graphics try console mode http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2443/is-there-console-mode-in-mac-os-x <comment278109> @Mark But I cannot use it in 10.10.5! I swear there are no other users log in, because I tried this after restarting my Macbook Air!
