Podcast downloads restart instead of finish <body> I'm downloading a 500 MB episode with 900 MB free space.   At about 75% completeness the download just resets and starts from the beginning. It has happened several times, and I've tried with different episodes.   I've tried deleting and reinstalling Podcasts. I have no problems streaming episodes or with any other network activity.   How do I finish a download? What's a probable cause?  Version 2.6 (1150.47) iOS 10 iPhone 5
