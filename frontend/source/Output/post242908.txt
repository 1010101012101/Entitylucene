Import wav files to iPhone using SD card reader <body> I have the below SD card reader. Is it possible to import .wav files onto my iPhone using the SD card reader? Or am I only able to import photos into my iPhone 6?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FB4Pk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer242909> No, you can only transfer certain images and videos.  This adapter will not transfer documents or audio files.  You could put those audio files on Dropbox or a network drive and then access them with the iPhone.  You should be able to transfer the wav's that way.
