What's up with "paused" applications in Launchpad? <body> When I activate Launch on both my Mavericks and Mountain Lion systems, a few of the application icons are (seemingly permanently) greyed out and marked "Paused" with an empty progress bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rP5uI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  It isn't hurting anything, but it's weird.  Any idea why?  <answer132112> It seems as if the download was started from the App Store and it was paused for some reason. There are two ways that you can get it to not say that anymore.  ol liSingle Click on the icon to resume the download./li liClick and hold, the press the "X" on the top left corner of the app to delete it. (Reinstall from the App Store is optional.)/li /ol  Hope that helps!  <answer205863> First, open App Store and try  Store Â Check for Unfinished Downloads...  Mine said there wasn't any, but apps restarted downloading.  <comment154375> Have you tried clicking them? Do they resume when you do so? <comment213812> In 10.10.3, I found an app in this state despite it having been successfully downloaded. I deleted it from Launchpad using 2 here, and it immediately reappeared as a new and ready app. No re-download required. <comment256322> Very useful. I'm looking for this solution for a while. <comment283581> I used this when it showed that Xcode was paused, even though Xcode had been downloaded and installed properly and is usable.  When I clicked on Check for Unfinished Downloads it changed Xcode in Launchpad from paused to ready.  Thanks! <comment326604> works for me, after click menu, the "paused" is gone
