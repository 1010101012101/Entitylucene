iPhone 7 bluetooth unable to pair with MacBook Pro? <body> I am trying to pair iPhone 7 through bluetooth with my MacBook Pro, but I have not been able to do this. It connects for few seconds then displays this message. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZKZKZ.png" alt="Network is unavailable"  <comment362932> Welcome to Ask Different! :) It's unclear from your question what steps you're taking . Can you please edit your question to explain what you've tried? Otherwise we may only end up telling you what you already know. <comment362937> I have not done anything else other than trying to pair them. What do you suggest ? <comment362938> I think it'd be useful for the community to know what steps you're taking to pair the iPhone? That way, if you're doing anything _obviously_ wrong, it's a quick fix. Or, if what you're doing *should* work, then we'll know to delve deeper into the problem. <comment362947> My friend, there is only one way to pair an iPhone 7 Bluetooth to a Macbook Pro! If you don't understand the question, perhaps, you should let others answer it. <comment362953> Actually, having an idea of what you're trying to accomplish, and what steps you've tried, is only going to help you get a relevant answer. Users try pairing their iPhones to their Macs for a number of reasons (e.g. for sharing an internet connection, sharing files between the two, etc). Some things are possible, some are not. Also, can I suggest you also add the exact model of MBP and what version of macOS you're using? These are all details that may help you get a good answer. <comment362954> already figured it out. <comment362963> Could you answer you own question? For other users that have the same problem...
