MacBook Pro with retina display external monitor connections <body> Is it possible to connect two external monitors to a Retina MacBook Pro without using Thunderbolt displays?  For example, one connected with HDMI and another using Apple's DVI connector and also use the screen on the laptop.  <answer54315> Yes, that should definitely be possible, as both Thunderbolt ports are also mini DisplayPort ports and the other would be connected via HDMI.

In addition to the HDMI port, you can use either of the Thunderbolt ports as mini DisplayPort ports, just like all Thunderbolt ports.  <answer117119> I can confirm this. I have three monitors connected and running in addition to the retina screen. two via the thunderbolt ports and one hdmi  However this caused my retina display to flicker.   <comment62166> Can you confirm both Thunderbolt ports can also act as mini DisplayPort ports - did you possibly try it yourself ? <comment62168> It's part of the Thunderbolt spec - all Thunderbolt ports have to act as mini DisplayPorts or they're not Thunderbolt. <comment62170> @iolsmit Forgot to tag you on my reply to your comment, and now I can't edit it. <comment64507> I can confirm that both Thunderbolt ports on the MBPR are mini DisplayPorts as well. I discovered it by accident and was pleasantly surprised. :-) <comment64508> @TheDoctorWhat I would be shocked if they weren't - all Thunderbolt ports are required to be mDP as well. <comment76770> I have three DVI monitors attached to mine using adapter cables.
