Image Compression Power point Presentation 2011 <body> I am trying to make a presentation, and am facing a problem.  I am facing picture compression issues . In addition to this saving problem, that pictures become worse quality every time I save the file, I am experiencing problems while trying to insert files. All pictures are inserted blurry. This applies for emf, png and, pdf.   I cannot find these advanced settings from Powerpoint for Mac 2011. How can I import/insert pictures to Powerpoint in their original quality? How can I control the picture compression?  I am using a Yosemite 10.10.2 version. Please help..!  <answer175480> Insert the image Highlight it Format picture tab Compress Picture quality Select the desired option. You'll likely want to choose Picture Quality: "Keep current resolution"  and Apply to:  "All pictures in this file" You'll need to do this once for each new file you create, since it's a per-file setting, not a PowerPoint-wide setting.
