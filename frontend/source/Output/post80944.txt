How do I configure Gmail Sync Accounts for iOS post January 2013? <body> At the end of January 2013 Google dropped support for Gmail Sync for nonpaying Gmail customers. I understood this drop in support to mean that no new devices could be setup, not that I could no longer configure existing devices. However, if there is still a way to affect the configuration of existing devices I cannot find it on Google's sync website.  Am I missing something? Is there a site I can visit to make configuration changes for devices?  <answer80973> No, I wouldn't say you're missing anything. As you say, Google will continue to support any configured devices beyond January 31, 2013 (from http://googleblog.blogspot.ch/2012/12/winter-cleaning.html):     Starting January 30, 2013, consumers won't be able to set up new   devices using Google Sync; however, emexisting Google Sync connections   will continue to function/em. Google Sync will continue to be fully   supported for Google Apps for Business, Government and Education.   Users of those products are unaffected by this announcement.   so no changes for your devices whatsoever (from http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2716936):     strongWhat do I need to do if Iâ€™m already using Google Sync?/strong      Nothing! Existing users can continue to use Google Sync on their   current devices.      strongWhat will happen if I keep using Google Sync after January 30, 2013?/strong      The service will continue to work for existing Google Sync devices.   Google Sync will continue to work, be supported, and take new sign-ups   for Google Apps for Business, Education, and Government customers.

In the former case, I'd appreciate that you marked the question as answered, in the latter case, could you tell me what is missing?
