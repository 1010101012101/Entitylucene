Why does my iPhone 4s resume playing a paused podcast after a missed call? <body> Here's the sequence of events:  ol liI'm listing to a podcast via the relatively new podcast app./li liI pause the podcast./li liTime passes. The phone sleeps./li liI get a call which I do not pick up; I don't even touch the phone./li liThe podcast resumes playing, surprising me and those around me./li /ol  This would be expected behavior except for item 2. I think it's a bug.  I'm running iOS 6.0, but this has been happening for a while; at least since 5.something. It's possible that it began happening when I started using the new podcast app instead of the music app for podcasts.  <answer69873> it's a bug they introduced in iOS6. drives my crazy.  Hope they fix it soon. No easy way to tell Apple they have a bug, unless you sign up to their developers program  <comment81169> To file bugs you only need the free developer account.
