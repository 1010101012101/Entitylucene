Keyboard shortcut for launching Apps in Dock <body> At Windows 7, Win + 1,2,3..9 launches the first, second etc App in taskbar. Is there a similar keyboard shortcut in OSX in order to launch Apps that are in the Dock?  <answer4391> I don't know the exact solution but you can use kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdF3/kbd after that you can navigate through Dock with keyboard arrow keys (kbd→/kbd or kbd←/kbd) and press kbdenter/kbd on your desire app.  <answer5816> As @Am1rr3zA said, you can use the default kbdControl/kbd + kbdfn/kbd + kbdF3/kbd. You can then press kbdEnter/kbd or kbdSpace/kbd to launch an app.  You can change the key binding in the Keyboard shortcuts menu in the Settings application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Vyh7.png" alt="changing the &quot;Focus on dock&quot; keyboard shortcut on Mac OS"  <answer39606> Just downloaded a 99 cent app from the mac app store called "Snap" that fixes this. Now I hit command-1 and the first app in my dock launches. Awesome!  <answer39611> This is a neat windows feature to want in the Dock, but if you like keyboard shortcuts, why not get a customizable application, like Quicksilver that lets you do a lot via the keyboard. Its not going to be easy / quick if you have a lot of Apps in your dock to remember a meaning less position number of a icon in a dock, when you could just ask for what you want directly.  Something like Quicksilver will not only help you open stuff in the dock faster it will let you open stuff not in the dock at extreme speeds.  For example, after getting Quicksilver's attention via a configurable key command, I type "F" and hit enter to open Firefox on my setup.    <comment4208> No, There’s no similar shortcut in OSX (sadly) <comment146876> Snap is now free in the app store :) <comment211059> Thanks, Moshe, lovely answer, nice focus in the Settings Pane :-) Worked first time for me, so I set it to Cmd-0 for the dock, which opens on previously selected item. And (from @James above) I have Cmd-1, ... for my fave apps. Cool. <comment215731> Thanks. It brings me the most wanted short-cut in windows! <comment232852> Awesome! Would have paid 99 cents instantly for this! Came from Ubuntu (Unity desktop) and really missed it
