How to upgrade / where can I download the installer for El Capitan? <body> My laptop (15" Mid 2012 MBP 16GB ram, 2.6ghz i7, 1GB graphics card) is running Yosemite 10.10.5.   I want to upgrade the OS, but one key piece of work software I have wont run on macOS Sierra 10.12.x, so instead I need to upgrade to El Capitan.   Where can I download an Official installer for El Capitan?   <comment372288> Please have a look at this [answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/286384/how-can-i-upgrade-an-old-imac-from-10-6-8/286420#286420)
