Where to find 3.5mm (male) to 3.5mm (male) cable that can control iPhone/iPod volume <body> Bonus if it has a mic and can handle iPhone calls  Basically I have a snowboarding helmet that has speakers built into it and has a 3.5mm (female) connection to the speakers.  <answer9213> If you'd also want to skip the cable itself, I would suggest taking a look at the Jabra BT3030 Bluetooth "Headset", which you could connect with any male-to-male cable.  <answer9220> There are such on ebay.com, I saw one today searching for "4 conductor 3.5mm [extension] cable" - I agree, they are rare. (You might have to build it yourself by buying two iPod earphones and then soldering the four cables, but I hope that's not necessary!)  <answer9240> I can't vouch for it, but it looks like what you're asking for :-)  http://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Stereo-built-microphone-iPhone/dp/B003QNIBBS  <comment60848> The OP would want a cable with four conductors (TRRS) in one end and three (TRS) on the other. The helmet doesn't itself have volume controls or a mic. <comment60849> This indeed looks right. <comment60852> Did any of the answers help you? Did you come up with your own solution? <comment201133> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because its about hardware shopping.
