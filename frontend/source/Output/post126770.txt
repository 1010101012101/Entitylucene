Repackaging .pkg files without installing/unpacking <body> Recently I was tasked with finding out a way to prepare OS X applications for automatic distribution to multiple machines.  Most applications require some tampering with their preferences before deploying. I have done it for Windows machines before, and usually I could just replace the preference files/registry entries right inside the .msi installer, using tools like Orca, Wise Package Studio and so on.  I am new to macs, but when I try to look for something similar for OS X, all I find is software to make packages from scratch (PackageMaker, Iceberg, etc.), but nothing for editing already created .pkg files.  So here is the question: is there a way to easily edit the content of .pkg file (replace some files, add a script, etc.), without having to install/unpackage it and then package the configured stuff back?  <answer126774> You can use the strongFlat Package Editor/strong from Apple.  ol liGo to Apple's Developer downloads site and download the Auxiliary Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012./li liOnce downloaded, open the DMG./li liFind PackageMaker.app and open the package contents, then navigate to Contents/Resources./li liCopy Flat Package Editor.app to /Applications or elsewhere then open it./li /ol  From this app you can open a .pkg and edit the contents by dragging files out, editing them and dragging them back in, then saving the package.  hr  Packages can be resigned using the button on the title bar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iv7oK.png" width="559"  <answer126775> I am not aware of any Apple recommended tools to edit existing package, codepkg/code or codempkg/code, files. Most packages are signed and thus any changes will invalidate their signature; although resigning is simple enough using codepkgbuild/code and an appropriate installer certificate.  h2Wrapping Up Existing Packages/h2  Consider creating a wrapper multi-package that adjusts any required files after installation. With this approach you can bundle up existing packages and then run post-install/update scripts as required.  h2pkgbuild/h2  There is little documentation about crafting packages as Apple traditionally relied on the graphical tool PackageMaker. Since Mac OS X 10.8, the PackageMaker tool has been replaced by the command line tools productbuild and pkgbuild.  The tool you will want to investigate is codepkgbuild/code. This tool eases the creation of packages containing multiple packages and scripts. About Distribution Definition Files talks about the internal file format.  <comment148491> Do You have flat packages or bundles? <comment148498> @MateuszSzlosek, it is not specified, so I have to assume we can have both. <comment148602> Thanks, this tool looks useful. Doesn't work with bundles, but I guess it's an outdated format and I probably won't have to deal with it too much. Some sources claim it is quite buggy, though. <comment148603> Thanks, I did consider wrapping packages instead of editing them, so I will look into it if Flat Package Editor won't be able to help me.
