Is there any Software on mac similar to Minitab? <body> Minitab is a statistic analysis software on Windows. Is there any Software on mac similar to Minitab ?  <answer22552> Some of IBM's SPSS Statistics products are Mac-compatible (even with Lion).  <comment25384> What do you mean by "similar"? Is the question whether there is statistical software for Mac OS or is there a particular set of features or user experience from Minitab you hope to replicate in Mac software? <comment28774> To follow up on Daniel's question, are you looking for the Six Sigma packages that are available, up to and including Quality Companion, etc.?  Or are you just looking for a statistical software package?  If the latter, R is definitely the route to follow, especially if you're in academia or flying solo. <comment113756> Not sure why but stats software for the mac is thin on the ground. I know that RStudio is very highly regarded by academics. <comment113757> If you could be a little more specific about your actual features you need, others will be able to know what packages might meet your needs.
