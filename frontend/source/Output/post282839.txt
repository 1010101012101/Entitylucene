Using pip vs. MacPorts for installing Python packages <body> I could install a python package (emfor example/em, codenumpy/code) on my Mac either via Macports:  precodeport install py-numpy /code/pre  or via codepip/code:  precodepip install numpy /code/pre  strongWhat are the general pros/cons of each approach? When should each approach be used?/strong   ul liWhen should I prefer one over the other? /li liDoes it matter whether the package I'm installing is small or large (e.g. codenumpy/code)?/li liDoes it depend on the version of python I'm using (code2.x/code vs. code3.x/code, or Apple's codepython/code vs. MacPort's codepython/code)? /li liDoes it matter whether I have multiple versions of codepython/code installed on my Mac? /li liCan they be used concurrently? /li /ul  I'm hoping for an answer that has a short listing of some pros/cons of each approach with some discussion about when to choose one over the other.   <comment356461> Related, but too specific: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16895282/should-i-use-brew-or-pip-for-installing-matplotlib. I'm asking for general python packages rather than just `matplotlib`. <comment356548> AFAIK these are already installed - you can check in terminal:  python and next command import numpy as np and if no errors then you have it. Alternate solution is to use anaconda from https://www.continuum.io/downloads - has many features and further installations with pip will go in your anaconda folder. <comment356600> @Yoan: `numpy` is just an example. I'm asking about installation of packages in general.
