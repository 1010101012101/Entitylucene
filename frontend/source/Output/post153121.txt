Find My Mac and Internet Recovery <body> So after a long unsuccessful day trying to find OS X Lion 10.7 build 11a2063 (let me know if you have the dmg!) with the intent of reinstalling OS X on my MacBook Air, currently without an Operating System, I have decided to give up and try the internet recovery option.   I purchased this unit off of ebay and am trying to avoid second hand Mac issues relating to previous owner icloud locks. With that in mind, I have formated the partitions on the hard drive (including recovery; creating new table via gparted) and reset NVRAM/PRAM (keyboard method).  ul liWill the previous owner's icloud account information still be present in the unit?/li liWhen I connect to the internet, will it dial to Find My Mac and notify the seller (or sellers seller) of my location, and lock me (if he so has set it)?/li /ul  <comment180268> It will still persist. It is not so easy to remove it, otherwise it would not serve the purpose of protecting the rightful owner. <comment180273> Thank you for your reply. Now, the question is, would it persist enough to communicate with FMM? <comment180276> Yes, as I said it will report to FMM as long it is on Internet. <comment180277> possible duplicate of [Can Find My Mac still persist after erasing the hard drive?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152965/can-find-my-mac-still-persist-after-erasing-the-hard-drive) <comment180278> you can get the Lion 10.7 from here http://store.apple.com/us/product/D6106Z/A/os-x-lion <comment180285> Thanks for your replies. Unfortunately, as is my understanding every Mac comes with a computer-specific build of Mac OS X. I currently have a mac store dmg of OSX Lion, but I get the "this version of mac is not supported on this platform" error message on my MBA.
