Crontab task "LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed ... with error -600 for the file ..." <body> I just moved to a new MacBook with El Capitan and trying to set up my crontab to do backup tasks.  Here is how I have it set up (via codecrontab -e/code)  precode40 7 * * * /Users/myusername/daily.sh "daily tasks run 7:40a" /code/pre  Daily.sh looks like this   precodeopen -b com.apple.terminal ~/backupThing1.sh open -b com.apple.terminal ~/dailyThing2.sh /code/pre  I have it set up this way so I see the terminals come up and can respond to some inputs and password prompts.  Anyway, this task fails with the following messages:  precodeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app with error -600 for the file /Users/myusername/backupThing1.sh. LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app with error -600 for the file /Users/myusername/dailyThing1.sh. /code/pre  I have verified that these scripts are owned by codemyusername/code and are executable.  What am I missing?  <comment285999> LSOpenURLsWithRole() always seems to be an execute permissions error - there are many similar questions on Ask Different - http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=LSOpenURLsWithRole%28%29
