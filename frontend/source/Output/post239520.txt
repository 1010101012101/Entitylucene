How to export Moom settings (especially keyboard shortcuts) to external file? <body> I'm working on some shell scripts to customize OS X to my preferences just by calling one script.  From a lot of native OS X options, script is going to easily import some predefined settings form 3rd party apps if possible.  My question is about Moom. I cannot spot any option to export existing settings (especially keyboard shortcuts) into non-encoded file.  Calling:  precode$ sudo find -x / -name "Moom" /code/pre  gives nothing more than:  precode/Applications/Moom.app/Contents/MacOS/Moom /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OBRKw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer239524> You can find Moom app preferences on the following file:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.manytricks.Moom.plist /code/pre  That file is not in clear text. But you can use codeplutil/code to convert and read it in the following way:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 -o - com.manytricks.Moom.plist /code/pre  <comment325284> This didn't work.
