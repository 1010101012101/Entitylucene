Privacy printing in Mac <body> Does anybody know how to prevent filename and username to be revealed when printing to a network printer? I would like to hide that information by default, specially the filename since it might reveal a lot of information. (Im using Yosemite although I doubt that matters at all)  <answer166912> Normally you can setup header and footer in the page setup or print setup em(depend on which program you print from)/em, so that the file name isn't shown.  If your network printer support "secure print" then use this feature, because then it will only be you that'll see the printed.  <comment195673> rename the file before printing <comment196322> I wanted something professional for everything I print... <comment196323> Its not that. Thanks for the try, but its the filename itself. Not shown on the printed document but only on the printer's logs.
