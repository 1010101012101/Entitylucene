Refresh Calendar.app with correct Exchange-account data <body> In the Calendar.app on OS X I sync some calendars with an Exchange-account. When I look at the same calendar in Outlook all calendar items seems to be correct, but in the Calendar.app some items has the wrong date. I would like the Calendar.app to refresh so that it is equal to what I can see in the Outlook calendar, but normal Refresh does not help.  Are there any workaround that could fix such an issue?  <answer271049> For me the solution was:   ol liOpen in Finder by running codeopen ~/Library/Calendars/code in Terminal/li liLook for a folder that ends with code.exchange/code. Open it./li liFind the correct Exchange calendar by looking at the Info.plist files in each of the code.calendar/code folders. Open the Events folder./li liIf you know that the problem is recent, sort all files by Date Modified. Set Cover Flow mode for showing the files in Finder/li liBy looking at the items in Finder, Skip through the ics-files to search for the item that has the wrong date./li li"Move to Trash" the incorrect item/li liStart the Calendar.app/li /ol  I guess that it might be possible to "Move to trash" the code.calendar/code folder for a full refresh of everything, but for me it was not necessary.
