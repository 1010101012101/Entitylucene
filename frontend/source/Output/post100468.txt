How to uninstall zsh <body> I'm new to Mac. A friend installed all kinds of additional software including codezsh/code which I would like to uninstall.

I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately. <comment213443> Thanks for pointing out that zsh is included with OS X. <comment347197> Only i remove .zshrc <comment372728> please explain how to uninstall.
