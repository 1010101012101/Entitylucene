Mounting iPad filesystem in Linux? <body> Is it possible to mount the core filesystem used on the iPad on to my linux box? There is an application named DiskAid which does this for Windows and Mac, so it emis/em accessible, just a matter of how.  I'm looking for the same sort of functionality as iFile (on jailbroken devices).  <answer20616> I doubt DiskAid (or any tool) gives you proper access to the full file system without a jailbreak. Rather, judging from the screenshots, it shows particular sections exposed through APIs.  <answer24300> Why not jailbreak the iPad and ssh over the wifi to access the filesystem?  Use care when you choose what software to do this, realize you are bypassing the security of iOS and pick good passwords.   <answer26871> Looks like you want an app that can use the libmobiledevice library. Some possible suggestions in the News section of that page.
