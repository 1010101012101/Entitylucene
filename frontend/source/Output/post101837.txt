Time capsule with Samsung Galaxy Note 8 <body> I just bought a Galaxy note 8 and I am trying to access my files on my apple time capsule.  I just got my macbook air last christmas so I am not to familiar with how to use everything just yet.  I can access my files on my time capsule through my macbook and my husband can through his pc.  Is there a feature that needs to be enabled on the time capsule or my note for this connection to work?  <answer101848> The only feature that needs to be enabled on the Time Capsule is the file sharing feature.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ffeDU.png" height="300" title="AirPort Utility"  This will activate AFP and SMB Filesharing which allows your Mac, PC and Android Device to access the Time Capsule and use it as a NAS (basically the Time Capsule is a glorified NAS).  To access your file on the Time Capsule you need a SMB client for Android such as ES File Explorer:  ol liAccess the menu and select the LAN tab./li liPerform a network scan and after a few seconds the time capsule should appear:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M2f9Gl.png" height="300" title="ES File Explorer" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4JlWl.png" height="300" title="ES File Explorer Network Scan"/li liSelect the computer and enter the login credentials to access your Time Capsule (username and password for the Time Capsule). You should see a folder that is named after the partition you see in the AirPort Utility when enabling the file sharing feature./li /ol  <comment120125> @grgarside Thanks for the well done edit.
