How can I use AppleScript to type text into a new window? <body> I'm trying to make an applescript that will write itself into a new window of Applescript Editor. But I can't figure out how it will paste itself with quotations. The code I have right now is   precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke "n" using command down     keystroke "tell application (System Events) keystroke (n) using command down end tell" end tell /code/pre  <answer254787> Quotes that are meant to be literal need to be escaped with a backslash and instead of using codekeystroke/code, use the following example to create a new AppleScript document containing the wanted emcode/em:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "AppleScript Editor"     set text of (make new document) to "tell application \"System Events\"\n\tkeystroke \"n\" using command down\nend tell" end tell /code/pre  Copy and paste the emcode/em example above into a new AppleScript document and press the Compile button.  It will then look like:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "AppleScript Editor"     set text of (make new document) to "tell application \"System Events\"     keystroke \"n\" using command down end tell" end tell /code/pre  Then press the Run button and it will create a new AppleScript document containing the following:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Events"     keystroke "n" using command down end tell /code/pre  Which if you then press the Run button of this new document, it creates a new blank AppleScript document.  Note: Depending on the version of OS X/macOS the codetell application "AppleScript Editor"/code line may be codetell application "Script Editor"/code.  You can still paste the example emcode/em, as is, into Script Editor and is will automatically remove the codeApple/code portion from codeAppleScript/code to show as codetell application "Script Editor"/code.  <answer254864> You are probably looking for an AppleScript quine. I'm no programmer nor a computer scientist so I can't really explain how to write self-reproducing code. Additional I don't know if a (high-level) script language like AppleScript is powerful enough to produce arbitrary quines.  I have found only two examples of working AppleScript quines which may help you to create your own one - only the first one creates a new AppleScript:  precodeset d to "on string_from_ASCII_numbers(x)     set s to ASCII character of item 1 of x     repeat with i from 2 to number of items in x         set s to s &amp; (ASCII character of item i of x)     end repeat end string_from_ASCII_numbers set set_d_to to {115, 101, 116, 32, 100, 32, 116, 111, 32} set scriptEditor to {83, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 32, 69, 100, 105, 116, 111, 114} set quine to string_from_ASCII_numbers(set_d_to) &amp; quote &amp; d &amp; quote &amp; return &amp; d tell application string_from_ASCII_numbers(scriptEditor) to make new document with properties {contents:quine}" on string_from_ASCII_numbers(x)     set s to ASCII character of item 1 of x     repeat with i from 2 to number of items in x         set s to s &amp; (ASCII character of item i of x)     end repeat end string_from_ASCII_numbers set set_d_to to {115, 101, 116, 32, 100, 32, 116, 111, 32} set scriptEditor to {83, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 32, 69, 100, 105, 116, 111, 114} set quine to string_from_ASCII_numbers(set_d_to) &amp; quote &amp; d &amp; quote &amp; return &amp; d tell application string_from_ASCII_numbers(scriptEditor) to make new document with properties {contents:quine} /code/pre  Download link: quine.applescript.zip  precodeset s to "on run {s}   set pre to «data utxt0073006500740020007300200074006f00200022» as text   set post to «data utxt0022000a00720075006e0020007300630072006900700074002000730020007700690074006800200070006100720061006d006500740065007200730020007b0073007d»   pre &amp; s &amp; post end run" run script s with parameters {s} /code/pre  Download link: quine.scpt  <comment317319> I deleted my original answer earlier today but have now edited and undeleted it. Hope it helps. <comment317340> Though your answer may work, reading the question once more I got the impression the major goal of the OP is an AppleScript which replicates itself: a [quine](http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm). I'm no mathematician nor a specialist for theoretical computer science but I assume there are programming languages which can accomplish this and others can't. AppleScript probably belongs to the latter. <comment317350> @klanomath, The OP stated two things, "_I'm trying to make an applescript that will write itself into a new window of Applescript Editor._" and "_But I can't figure out how it will paste itself with quotations._" neither of which mention self-replicating nor any other parameters of how/what is trying to be accomplished. So until the OP comments, it's anyones guess to what the real intension is. <comment317352> The second one doesn't really do much of anything and the first one fails in AppleScript Editor as it's apparently coded for Script Editor.  The OP does say "_new window of Applescript Editor_" not "_new window of Script Editor_" <comment317353> To work with AppleScript Editor vs. Script Editor replace both `set scriptEditor to {83, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 32, 69, 100, 105, 116, 111, 114}` lines with `set scriptEditor to {65, 112, 112, 108, 101, 83, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 32, 69, 100, 105, 116, 111, 114}`. <comment317354> You need to clearly explicitly and specifically what it is your trying to do here, because as you can see the two answers given so far are looking at your question from two entirely unrelated directions.
