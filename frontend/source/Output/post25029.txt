Can't connect to app store after installing VPN software <body> I started experiencing problems after playing with hotspotshield.com,br it may have done something to the core apple connection preferences.  I have looked all over the internet and I can't find a solution..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sD4Ab.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3DixP.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xeokD.png" alt="enter image description here"  http://f.cl.ly/items/3M1v43403h2F3J1I3j2v/Screen%20Shot%202011-09-14%20at%208.09.02%20PM.png  http://f.cl.ly/items/2p1Q240X460T2R2L0b19/Screen%20Shot%202011-09-17%20at%209.47.54%20PM.png  Here are my specs - Lion 10.7.1     do you have any other connectivity issues and did you knowingly change any network configurations when you were using hotspotshield?   ul liI had no other connectivity issues beforehand and no i didn't change any network settings to my knowledge./li liI've tried connecting thru Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and iPhone USB tethering. The internet does work, but the software update and app store will not connect./li liI created a new user to test it and it doesn't work../li liPer the new image added, the badge does get updated, but it isn't allowing access../li /ul  <answer25068> In code/System/Library/CoreServices/code there is a Network Diagnostics app that should look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bP4l2.png" alt="Network Diagnostics"  Give that Wizard a try to see if it helps you fixing your networking. I'm sure there's got to be something weird going on.  strongUPDATE/strong: ok, since you have already tried a lot of things (suggested by various users across the board), let's try something different.   Could you post a screenshot of the following screens.  System Preferences - Network  System Preferences - Network - Advanced (bottom right corner, make sure you have the right connection selected)(*) - And then I'm interested in three screens:   ul liTCP/IP/li liDNS/li liProxies/li /ul  Feel free to add anything else you see fit.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/skZI3.jpg" alt="network pane"   Additionally, I'd suggest you disable Little Snitch (I have it too and it's great, but at this point in can only add problems rather than help fixing them).  Download a free trial of Charles Proxy so we can analyze what your outgoing traffic is attempting to do.  That should keep you busy for a few minutes while I finish my Coffee ;)  (*)subYeah, i was having a Tantalizing Turkish Coffee @ Philz in SF ;) /sub  <answer25075> Hotspot Shield comes with an Uninstaller. Did you run it, and did that solve your problem? Once you run the uninstall, you should reboot your machine.  We use VPN services (paid, I'm afraid) from Witopia and Hotspot VPN (we're trying both services for a year to see which we like better). I'm the one with Witopia, and I use OpenVPN on my MacBook, and have a choice of Cisco IPSec or PPTP on my iDevices. No problems with any of these.  <answer25303> h1A few things to try/h1  Here are a few things you could try to get your networking settings working again.  h3Try Signing Out/h3  Try signing out by selecting "Sign Out" from the "Store" menu and then logging back in.  h3Check the preferences in Keychain Access/h3  ol liOpen Keychain Access/li liOpen Keychain Access Preferences/li liIn Preferences window select the certificates tab/li liThe first option: "Online Certificate Status Protocol" select "Best Attempt"/li liThe second option: "Certificate Revocation List" select "Best Attempt"/li liLeave the third option alone. It will most likely be set to OCSP./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7vS9e.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3Try deleting some App Store preferences and caches/h3  You can safely delete the App Store preferences as they will be recreated the next time you use the app. Here's what you should do:  ol liQuit the App Store/li liDelete the file at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.appstore.plist/li liDelete the file at ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore/Cache.db/li liDelete the file at ~/Library/Cookies/com.apple.appstore.plist/li liDelete the file at ~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.plist/li liLogout &amp; Login/li liRestart the Mac App Store/li /ol  h3Upgrade Little Snitch/h3  If you have Little Snitch installed make sure that it is fully up-to-date. The current version is 2.4.2 and the release notes say that 2.4.1 fixed "an incompatibility with Mac App Store and Software Update."  Also because Little Snitch can mess with a lot of basic networking services (even if you don't think it is) try uninstalling it to be absolutely sure that it isn't conflicting.  strongPlease let us know which, if any, of these solutions helps with your issue./strong  <answer25364> Interesting.  If you are on Lion, which you seem to be from the screenshots, then you can first try:  precodeman 8 softwareupdate  softwareupdate -l  /code/pre  Would ordinarily list your available updates.  But wait!  Open another tab and in this one you are going  to use the handy codenettop(1)/code command    Just type "nettop" and see what it says.  Do not quit, use down arrow to see the bottom, use left arrow to summarize.  Do not quit.  Now run  precodesoftwareupdate -l and see if anything proper happens _on the nettop tab_. ( Paste it here I guess )  /code/pre  h2The first thing we can try with lion until the next os:/h2  precodeman sysdiagnose  # handy as a gun in a knifefight /code/pre  There will be no secrets, I believe.    h2Trivia:/h2  precodeman 8 tmdiagnose man 8 mddiagnose # spotlight  /code/pre  h2This is a painfully obvious thing to ask but,/h2  did you try looking at the Console.app?  Or typing   precodesyslog /code/pre  to see what osX thinks the problem is ?  precodesyslog -F raw -w 20. /code/pre  will make it act like tail -f  Finally, you can reach for the rum, the chalk, and the chicken and use, if you are using wi-fi that is:  precodeairportd   #there is no man page for this  airportd prefs  # see what is set  airportd readNVRAM # see what your fallback network is set to. /code/pre  Have you tried rebooting and holding down cmd-R, to get to the recovery partition?  The main drive is not mounted,  it's very cool, assuming you did not have a custom partioning scheme...  <answer25376> 1) Have you tried:  codedefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate &gt; ~/Desktop/su.dwrites.txt/code  codedefaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate/code  (The first line will save your SoftwareUpdate settings to a file, the second will delete them.)  2) Check   ~/Library/LaunchAgents  /Library/LaunchDaemons  /Library/LaunchAgents  to make sure that there's nothing in there which is mucking with your network settings.  If you find anything that you aren't sure about, try moving it to your Desktop and then reboot.  3) If that still doesn't do it, check codenetstat -rn/code to see if it's showing anything odd.  strongUpdated 2011-09-20 to add:/strong  Ok, so it appears that didn't help.  Other possibilities:  codesudo mv  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist ~/Desktop//code  and reboot to make sure that those settings have been removed.  I'm not sure how this is effecting emonly/em Software Update and the Mac App Store.  Two more commands:  codenetworksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet/code  codenetworksetup -getwebproxy Wi-Fi/code  (depending on which one you use to connect)  They should output something like:     Enabled: Nobr   Server:br   Port: 0br   Authenticated Proxy Enabled: 0   strong2011-09-21:/strong  This almost seems too simple to suggest, but for the sake of completeness: have you tried creating a new "Location" in System Preferences  Network?   By default it will be "Automatic" but if you click it, there should be an option to "Edit Locations".  Try creating a new one and switch to that, then try again.  <comment28251> Yah, thats the crazy thing, it looks totally good ! http://see.weareinto.com/AATE <comment28252> I did run the uninstaller and restart.. first thing I tried.. :( still hasn't fixed my issue <comment28367> But did you follow the wizard? :) <comment28507> How are you connecting? Wi-Fi? Try over ethernet. Also, make sure the VPN client isn't running as this will stop any packets from getting through / going out unless it's through your VPN tunnel. <comment28586> I've tried connecting over several mediums.. how do I check on a VPN client? <comment28587> Question updated <comment28594> Do you have any VPNs listed in Settings - General - Network - VPN ? <comment28595> What version of iTunes are you using? iTunes updates a number of core components needed for the app stores. <comment28598> If you have a VPN connection on you will see a image in your bar (like this: http://vpn-ninja.com/images/mac/mac8.jpg) with a timer showing how long the connection has been on. If you have this, disconnect and try connecting to something. <comment28599> Do you have Little Snitch installed? <comment28623> I don't know where `Settings - General - Network - VPN` is.. ? System Preferences? <comment28624> I am using iTunes 10.4.1 <comment28625> I do have little snitch installed, but I'm not disabling any connections <comment28626> Great tips, but just did all of this and it didn't work :( <comment28627> Yes, I used the whole wizard <comment28628> Question updated.. <comment28632> Kirk, can you create a new account (System Preferences  Users and Groups) and try to log into the App Store using that? It would help narrow down the problem greatly. <comment28641> Didn't you see my question update? `I created a new user to test it and it doesn't work..` <comment28669> What version of Little Snitch are you using? <comment28849> A registered version of `Version 2.4 (2038)` <comment28850> Wow ! awesome, working thru it.. looks like the app store and software update are having problems http://see.weareinto.com/AGd5 <comment28851> `kirkstrobeck:~ kirkstrobeck$ man 8 sysdiagnose   No entry for sysdiagnose in section 8 of the manual` <comment28853> I think I have some progress.. when using the line `softwareupdate -l` the other window does show a connection http://see.weareinto.com/AGvp <comment28855> Here are the messages I get when launching appstore.. http://see.weareinto.com/AGvR <comment28856> I tried running the 2 linesin terminal, it didn't do anything.. <comment28857> I removed the contents of all my launch items folders and logged out/in but it's still not working.. <comment28858> I ran the netstat command and this is what I get.. http://see.weareinto.com/AHGf <comment28888> sysdiagnose is in section 1, `man sysdiagnose` is sufficient. `man 1 sysdiagnose` works too if you really want to be explicit :). <comment28917> The terminal commands would not have any output. The first one saved your current settings to a file, and the second one deleted/reset your Software Update permissions. <comment28935> @VxJasonxV Thanks, and apologies <comment28937> I don't have that com.akami file on my system... where is it on yours? <comment28939> Try to run Software Update. After it fails, go to Console and check your secure log. Look for entries like this: "com.apple.SecurityServer[25]: Succeeded authorizing right 'com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.scan'" What do they say? <comment29263> Wow, I have no idea what happened, but something worked. Also, my Little Snitch broke for some reason. I wish I could award all of you the bounty, but I'm pretty sure this is directly related to the launch items. <comment29264> This was very helpful, but I don't think it was the final solution. Again, I wish I could just give away tons of bounty. Thank you so much for the help ! <comment29552> no problem,the bounty always is secondary ;)
