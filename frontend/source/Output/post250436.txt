Camera is not being detected on Mac <body> I have a Macbook Pro (Retina) and recently my camera stopped working.   I didn't drop it or anything, it's just not being detected as a hardware.  When I try to see why, System Report shows me:   precodeNo video capture devices were found. /code/pre  I don't have Apple support anymore and I can't find any comprehensive guide or tips for this kind of problem - I just found issues with the camera, but not itself not being detected.  I tried to reset NVRAM and other things such as Diagnose mode, which gave me this error code above:  precode4HDD/11/40000000:SATA(0,0) /code/pre  But on subsequent runs of this diagnose mode gives me no error. I also think it's unlike SATA has to do with the camera, as it typically uses USB.  I'm kind of lost and I just want to take it to assistance only if there are no other options, since I need my computer to work.  <answer250871> For anyone experiencing this problem, I would suggest going with System Diagnose + NVRAM reset + SMC reset + Disk repair.  And if none of those work, follow @IronCraftMan advice and proceed with reinstalling OS X - you won't lose any data.  These steps worked for me.  <comment310975> Could the error with the SATA/HD be affecting the Camera, possible a corrupted hard drive? <comment311141> It's actually a SSD, not HD. But I performed Disk Utility's First Aid and it didn't report anything wrong. If you have any tips on that sense, I would much appreciate @IronCraftMan . <comment311219> ok. Have you tried reinstalling OS X? <comment311225> No, I haven't, but do you really think that could fix this or are you just trying something different? Also, since I backup to TimeMachine, not sure that reinstaling / restoring time machine backup would change anything. <comment311228> I'm not taking about restoring from time machine. Either re-download the OS X installer or use Recovery HD and just reinstall. My guess is that since you didn't have any physical damage, something may be wrong with the driver. <comment311233> Right, but then I grab data back from time machine, but manually? There should be a way to restore the driver in a more practical way. <comment311280> you won't loose any of your data when reinstalling OS X. <comment311327> It keeps all apps too? I guess it will only override /System, /Library, right? Thanks @IronCraftMan ! <comment311332> like I said, it won't delete any of your data. It's just like going from OS X 10.10 to 10.11, only you're just reinstalling the same version. <comment311346> Got it. Thanks. Will try and hope it solves it. <comment311682> @IronCraftMan my issue was solved! I guess it was some of those steps (Diagnose, NVRAM/SMC reset, Disk Repair), and it "fixed itself". I was about to reinstall OS X today, but when I booted my Mac today, camera was ok (it flashed correctly when I ran software that needed it, in a meeting). Anyways, thanks for the tip as it would probably solve my problem if those things didn't !
