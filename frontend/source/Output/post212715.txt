Can I use iCloud to sync my videos from my phone to my PC? <body> I'm trying to figure out how to use iCloud to get my videos and photos onto my PC. Here's my iCloud configuration:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JraQb.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I go to that folder, my PhotoStream which only has photos, not videos. It's the same when I go "My Computer - iCloud Photos".  Is there anyway to get videos to sync also please?  Thank you.
