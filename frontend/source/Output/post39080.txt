why does less seem to think my terminal has more lines than it does? <body> Don't know if this is really an OS X question, but:  codeless/code seems to insist that my terminal (whether I'm using the builtin Terminal or iTerm2) has more lines than are actually displayed, and so the top of whatever I'm codeless/codeing is always off the screen.  My LINES environment variable matches the number of visible lines in the terminal.  I have a vague recollection that it didn't use to be this way, but has been this way for me for several months, at least.  Suggestions?  <comment44308> Maybe `less` is suggesting you use `more` :-p.  I can't reproduce this on Lion.  Have you changed your LESS environment variable? <comment44413> Does it happen with all files or only with specific ones? <comment111002> I have the same problem with 'less'.  'more' works for me, good suggestion.
