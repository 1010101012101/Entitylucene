10.10 updated and my internal camera not working <body> I have just updated my 2013 MacBook Pro 13 inch with 10.10 Yosemite, but now I can't webcast.    How do I turn the camera back on?  <answer157930> This seems to be a bug. I experience the same problem after upgrading to 10.10.1. See Apple Discussions for some ideas to solve it (resetting SMC). But since the proposed solutions are not consistently helping to solve the problem, I really suspect a driver problem. My System Profiler is showing "No video capture devices were found." Alternatively you could try to connect an external USB camera.  <answer168127> Hi I had the exact same problem. Played around with terminal and figured out a way to reset the camera. Just open terminal, paste this in to it, and then press kbdReturn/kbd:  precodesudo killall VDCAssistant /code/pre  <comment182132> Does the camera work if you go to PhotoBooth? <comment182169> Yes it works in Photo Booth.  Apple's answer is a Genius Bar appt. on 11th November <comment211964> That helped me too. But what exactly is this command do? What is `VDCAssistant`? Some info can be found [here](http://osxdaily.com/2013/12/27/fix-there-is-no-connected-camera-error-mac/). <comment253805> Facing the same issue. For me the VDCAssistant is not running at all. Any suggestion? <comment292929> It didn't work via terminal, but force quitting VDCAssistant via Activity Monitor did. Basically the same thing.
