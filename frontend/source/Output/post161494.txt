External display occasionally shows just noise <body> When I'm at work I have my Macbook Air mid-2013 hooked up to a Samsung SyncMaster 2443 display via a ThunderBolt-to-HDMI adapter and then to a HDMI-to-DVI adapter.  Almost every second time I switch the display on, the display is just noise. The resolution is correctly detected but the display is like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cpQak.jpg" alt=""  If this happened only when I first connect the display, it would be no problem, but it happens almost every time I lock my mac, and I have to power cycle the display 2-3 times to fix it.  Note that this behaviour has been present since Maverics, it's not new in Yosemite.  Is there a fix for this?  <answer183090> I have had the same problem with Maverick (in clamshell mode) / external monitor (Samsung SyncMaster 2443) when I lock my screen and use my bluetooth mouse or keyboard to wake up the computer.  I was able to fix the problem in 2 ways:  open the lid, login and unplu, replug the external monitor (pretty annoying) when the multicolor static shows, press CTRL+SHIFT+Eject as if to lock the computer again, then wake up the computer again and I now have the normal login screen as normal (not ideal but less disruptive solution).  I hope this helps !  <comment188737> reducing the number of adaptors would be my first try. <comment188745> agreed, check your cables contacts when that happens <comment188746> I use the display with the HDMI-DVI converter with another laptop and the Macbook Air with the TB-HDMI converter with multiple other displays, no problems. So it can't be a faulty converter, but the combination of the two can be a problem. Will try to get a straight TB-DVI adapter for testing.
