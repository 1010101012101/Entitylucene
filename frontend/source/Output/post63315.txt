How to synchronize QuickTime video playback with 3 different Macs? <body> Do you know a method to play three (QuickTime) videos in sync on three different machines? At least I would trigger the space bar to start them in sync.  <answer63326> I don't know how well synchronized it would be, but you could try using codeat/code (or launchd or cron) to run an osascript command at a specified time.  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist at 16:12 &lt;&lt;&lt; 'osascript -e "tell app \"QuickTime Player\" to play document 1"' /code/pre  <answer66843> You could use VLC to push the video out as a UDP Multicast stream (or on HTTP).  You can then receive the stream on all machines.  <answer105249> Did you try Multiscreener? I have used this in the past and worked flawlessly for 3 day runs. http://www.zachpoff.com/software/multiscreener/  <comment73256> Thanks for the answer! (never heard of osascript, I will do a research) Anyway, I think that the three macs will have different loading time for loading quicktime application and the videos, so I think it will be hardly synchronize with this command.. It would be very good if I find the method just for triggering for example the space bar when videos are loaded.. I will continue my research :-) <comment73283> If the computers are near each other and you have a Bluetooth keyboard, have you tried pairing it with all of them? <comment73284> The command just tells QuickTime Player to play a video that has been opened before. You could try adding something like `sleep 0.1; ` before it on faster computers.
