How do I get OS X 10.8.x to keep Finder windows open after a restart? <body> I just installed OS X 10.8.x on my Mac. An annoying thing I've discovered is that, whenever I restart the computer, it closes all the windows I have open in Finder. This is extremely annoying as I often have a large number of windows open to help me keep track of what I've been working on that day and need to back up. I check the "Reopen windows when logging back in" on the restart command but, as far as I can tell, it just reopens my applications, which isn't really what I'm looking for.  <answer92981> Try unchecking System Preferences  General  Close windows when quitting an application. 10.7 restored the state of applications by default but 10.8 doesn't.  This enables restoring state in just Finder:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool true killall Finder /code/pre  <comment109054> Worked in 10.7? <comment109122> Thanks, but I'm not sure how to implement the second part of your answer. I assume it's some sort of coding language. Where would I enter it into the system? <comment109132> Just paste it to Terminal. You can find bundle identifiers of other applications with something like `osascript -e 'id of app "Safari"'`. <comment109276> OK, thanks. It worked like a charm. <comment154070> In `System Preferences - General`, is there an option "Close windows when quitting an application"? What's it set to? That option is there on 10.9, but not sure about 10.8. I'm guessing you had it set to the wrong value. Note: system preferences will apply to *all* apps (that support the feature), while the posted answer will apply only to Finder. This means the setting will override the system wide setting just for the Finder app. <comment165155> @third_aardvark if this answered your question please click the checkmark underneath the vote up/down arrows next to the answer to indicate that it solved your problem.
