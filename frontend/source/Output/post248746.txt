Sync custom folder icon with Dropbox <body> I have added custom folder icons to some of the folders in my Dropbox. I would like this to get synced across devices, but it seems that it does not. Is there a way to get custom icons to sync with Dropbox?  On Windows XP (if mind serves me right) I think I could use desktop.ini files in a folder to set some preferences. Perhaps there is something similar for Mac?  <answer248750> Your icon files are stored in the code.DS_Store/code file located in each folder.  This file is what contains the metadata of the folder including the custom icon, the icon spacing, etc.  What is a .DS_Store file?  Drop Box, does not sync this particular file.  According to their help guide code.DS_Store/code is ignored:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xgbyL.png" alt="enter image description here"  This means that your custom icon won't get synced.  You will have to create the custom icon manually.  <comment308405> Great explanation, but still a bit sad. I guess they do it to avoid users having lots of hidden duplicate files.
