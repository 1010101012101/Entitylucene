AppleScript click on website link <body> I need an AppleScript to select a specific text field of an area, paste a text and click enter.  I have inspected the text (research) field.  Here is the result:  precode&lt;input placeholder=​"Search Value" id=​"quickSearchValue" type=​"text" value=​"ertet" name="7.7.7.7"&gt;​ /code/pre  Here's what I tried so far, but without any success:   precodetell application "Safari"     activate      delay 3     tell application "System Events"         keystroke (the clipboard)     end tell     delay 0.3     tell document 1         do JavaScript "document.getElementById('7.7.7.7').click();"     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment218367> Well, for starters, `name` and `id` are not the same thing. The HTML element you listed has a _name_ of `7.7.7.7` but an _ID_ of `quickSearchValue`. Running `getElementById('7.7.7.7')` will never work because there is no element with that ID on the page. Also, it's not clear what you're asking to do. Your title says "click on web site link", your text says click a text field, paste, and hit enter. (Presuming that means the keyboard key, not a button on the page called enter?) Your script does not have anything to hit the enter key on the keyboard. <comment218368> Also your script is backward - you're trying to paste before the element is selected, if I'm understanding your code's intent correctly. <comment221100> Hi, thank you for you reply, I tried with quickSearchValue instead but its not working. I also tried set value of text field 1 of group 1 of group 2 of UI element 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of group 2 of group 1 of window 1 to "blablalbla" but not working neither
