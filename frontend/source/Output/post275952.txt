Keep desktop icons as they are shortly after logging in <body> The following image shows two screenshots of my Mac's desktop whilst starting up. The first is a few seconds after starting, whilst the other one is a few seconds to shutdown.  I prefer the icons on the left, from the first screenshot. I would like to keep them as default. How can I show the first set of icons as default?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/48nju.jpg" alt=""  <answer275957> This is because it loads the previews of the files, which replace the default file icons. To disable icon previews on the desktop, click on the desktop, press ⌘J and uncheck ‘Show icon previews’.                                                       img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPWYp.png" width="210"
