Clipboard manager for pasting multiple items at once? <body> I'm looking for an app that let me copy multiple items from different locations and paste them at once, I have tried many clipboard managers but none of them let me to paste my whole clipboard history at once and I have to paste the items one by one which is not good at all.  Please help me if there is a clipboard manager or app (for Lion) that let me do that, thanks.  <answer57270> My favourite swiss army knife for OS X, LaunchBar, has clipboard history and management. In addition to being able to access historical, clipped information it can also do clip-merge. A quick double press of Cmd-C will merge the currently selected contents in to the current top-of-the-heap clipboard object for you, allowing you to paste them as one object with a single Cmd-V.  You can merge multiple items in the clipboard history by selecting the first one and doing Cmd-C and then selecting additional items and doing the quick, double press of Cmd-C. They'll all get merged in to the top item as expected.
