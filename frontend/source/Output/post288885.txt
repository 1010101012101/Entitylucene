Korean input appears off occasionally <body> While typing Korean, occasionally the characters do not render correctly. What should appear as: code안녕/code, will parse as codeㅇㅏㄴ ㄴㅕㅇ/code. This bug happens especially as I switch focus between applications and try to type Korean in both. However, this bug also happens when I switch from English to Korean and back sometimes.  When it goes into this mode, the only solution I have found is to click the language bar at the top of the menu, and then click Korean again (even though it is already selected). Using the hot-keys for switching languages, to English and back to Korean does not fix the problem.   Any suggestions? I don't want to use my mouse all the time to fix this bug when I want to just be typing. Also, the Korean keyboard I am using is (2-Set Korean), OS version 10.12.5.
