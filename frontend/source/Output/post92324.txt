Why does changing my iTunes Media folder result in lost data? How can I fix it? <body> I have a MacBook Air, which means I'm perpetually hitting my head on a low ceiling when it comes to hard drive (technically SSD) space.  To make this a little less painful I put my music on a thumb drive, so that more critical things can be always available on my internal drive.  Not long ago I created a separate codeiTunes Lite/code folder inside code~/Music/code, so that I can use it when my thumb drive is not plugged in, and just stream songs from iCloud.  Then today I ripped a CD to transfer it to my iPad, and first switched back to my normal iTunes directory.  When I did this, I discovered that all of my iTunes data was gone!  All my files are there, but nothing shows up in my library.  Here are the directories:  ul licode~/Music/iTunes Lite/code, a normal directory/li licode~/Music/iTunes/code, a symbolic link pointing to code/Volumes/Coco/Music/iTunes/code.  codeCoco/code is my thumb drive, of course./li /ul  I'm fairly confident I've done this without any problem before iTunes 11.  How can I do it now?  How can I recover my lost data?  <comment108834> Was it a mistake to post over the Memorial Day weekend!?  I'm really surprised no one has answered...
