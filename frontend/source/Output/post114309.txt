Increase Audio Volume of MOV-Video in OS X <body> I have a MOV-Video file and I want to increase the volume of the audio layer without reencoding the entire video.  Is there a way to solve this problem?  <comment133959> I'm not sure if this is the right SE to ask this question. Maybe http://avp.stackexchange.com is a better place? In the meantime have a look at [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org). [Here](http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2012-February/004696.html) it is explained how you can add audio to video without re-encoding. You can extract the original audio, increase the gain and then add it back to the video with the linked method. <comment134175> Your answer already completely solved my problem! :)
