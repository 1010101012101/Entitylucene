2011 iMac (high-end) taken apart, how to reassemble? <body> Well, this is awkward.  I set about disassembling my iMac in attempt to fix a problem, and the problem is fixed, but now I'm not quite sure how to put it back together.  Does anyone know where I can find a guide on how to put it back together?  Do you think Apple repairs (store &amp; authorized dealers) will take my iMac and put it back together if I asked them to? (Out of my pocket of course, my warranty expired)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R36W8.jpg" alt="This is awkward"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/65JdL.jpg" alt="Optic Drive, Hard Drive, power boards"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QMIoy.jpg" alt="Logic Board"  <answer188565> Nothing is better than iFixit replacement guides (link for your 27 inch 2011 model). This tutorials are technically correct and safe to apply. Hi-res pictures are also available. Additonally you can try to find some videos in Youtube  <comment223230> Nice house plans. Is that a 3 bedroom? In the future, try taking the pictures as you disassemble your computer. Closest manual I can come up with is for a [iMac mid 2010](http://www.tim.id.au/blog/tims-laptop-service-manuals/). <comment223381> haha its a warehouse
