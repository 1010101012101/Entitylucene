Changing text applied when duplicating file in Finder <body> When duplicating files in the finder, OS X attaches a space followed by 'copy' to the file name. This can lead to some file alphabetizing problems and the copies may appear out of order (not directly subsequent to the original). Is there a way to change the appended text? I would prefer that it says '_1' or _copy. Thanks.    <answer110845> ol liOpen /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/  supUse Show Package Contents to browse the package in Finder, or open using Terminal, etc./sup/li liOpen Localizable.strings in BBEdit or other editor capable of editing .strings files./li listrongN4/strong contains the string that is used to name the duplicate file.  precode^0 copy /code/pre  supcode^0/code is the previous file's name.

Works for me. @Frizlab, is this really a problem worth noting? Apple is continuing to remove complexity and yet we must pursue the features we want. How else but to hack? <comment167065> I have Mountain Lion, I opened */System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/ Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings* but it doesn't have either *N4* nor *^0 copy*, where could it be? (I do use the OS in English) <comment167066> @Petruza What app did you open the strings file in? <comment167068> @GeorgeGarside TextWrangler, it correctly opens it as a text file, I can see all the strings there, but not these. Oh, I see it's kind of a binary file, but TextWrangler correctly opens it as a XML plist file. <comment167069> I opened it with Xcode 5, *N4* and *^0 copy* are definitely not here. mdfind doesn't actually find those strings in English.lproj/ either.
