How to trace what is re-entering jet.com super-cookie? <body> In Safari (Version 10.1.1 (10603.2.5)) on OS X Yosemite, in the strongPreferences.../strong - strongPrivacy [Manage Website Data...]/strong I have an entry:  precodejet.com Databses /code/pre  If I delete this entry, it disappears, and returns in two seconds or less, even with no other windows open, certainly none open to codejet.com/code, and even with strongCookies and website data/strong set to strongAlways Block/strong. Any ideas how to trace what is re-entering this super-cookie?  <answer288237> You can use a command line utility called codefs_usage/code to find out which application is accessing a file.  To keep an eye on the files stored for this "jet.com" entry the following command will show all activity on all files that contain "https_jet.com" in the file name or path.  precodesudo fs_usage -f filesystem | grep "https_jet.com" /code/pre  I'd recommend running this command and trying to delete the entry again. You'll be prompted for your password because of the codesudo/code command at the beginning, but that's necessary because codefs_usage/code needs elevated root permissions. To cancel the command once you think you have enough information hold down kbdCTRL/kbd and hit kbdC/kbd.  For example while running that command and removing the entry using Safari's preference pane I get the following entries, which shows activity from Safari, WebKit, dbfseventsd and fseventsd on these files. If the removal of these files is being prevented or if something is recreating them, I'd expect you to see something that might help you identify the culprit.  precode00:58:59  unlink            /Users/alistair/Library/WebKit/MediaKeys/https_jet.com_0                         0.000010   Safari       00:58:59  getattrlist       /Users/alistair/Library/WebKit/MediaKeys/https_jet.com_0                         0.000003   Safari       00:58:59  rmdir             /Users/alistair/Library/WebKit/MediaKeys/https_jet.com_0                         0.000002   Safari       00:58:59  unlink            /Users/alistair/Library/WebKit/MediaKeys/https_jet.com_0                         0.000002   Safari       00:58:59  getattrlist       /Users/alistair/Library/WebKit/MediaKeys/https_jet.com_0                         0.000002   Safari       00:58:59  rmdir             /Users/alistair/Library/WebKit/MediaKeys/https_jet.com_0                         0.000002   Safari       00:58:59  open              /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/Databases/___IndexedDB/https_jet.com_0            0.000042   com.apple.We 00:58:59  getattrlist       /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/Databases/___IndexedDB/https_jet.com_0            0.000003   com.apple.We 00:58:59  rmdir             /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/Databases/___IndexedDB/https_jet.com_0            0.000003   com.apple.We 00:58:59  open              /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/Databases/___IndexedDB/https_jet.com_0            0.000004   com.apple.We 00:58:59  getattrlist       /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/Databases/___IndexedDB/https_jet.com_0            0.000002   com.apple.We 00:58:59  rmdir             /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/Databases/___IndexedDB/https_jet.com_0            0.000002   com.apple.We 00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000008   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000002   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000013   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-wal     0.000006   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-wal     0.000002   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-shm     0.000002   Safari       00:58:59  stat64            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000025   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000005   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000003   Safari       00:58:59  unlink            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000194   Safari       00:58:59  unlink            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-wal     0.000271   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-shm     0.000004   Safari       00:58:59    HFS_update      /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-shm     0.000003   Safari       00:58:59  unlink            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-shm     0.000070   Safari       00:58:59  stat64            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000006   Safari       00:58:59  stat64            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-wal     0.000004   Safari       00:58:59  stat64            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-shm     0.000003   Safari       00:58:59  access            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-shm     0.000020   dbfseventsd  00:58:59  access            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-wal     0.000004   dbfseventsd  00:58:59  access            /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000003   dbfseventsd  00:58:59  lstat64           /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage         0.000019   fseventsd    00:58:59  lstat64           /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-wal     0.000003   fseventsd    00:58:59  lstat64           /Users/alistair/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/https_jet.com_0.localstorage-shm     0.000002   fseventsd /code/pre  <answer288262> go to code~/Library/Safari/Databases/___IndexedDB/code delete the file-files in there  <comment363957> Can not reproduce on Safari 10.1, macOS 10.12.4.
