Is there a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3/USB-C converter? <body> I have the opposite problem of most -- I have an older macbook with no USB-C port, and I need one.   I bought this a while ago for a different laptop https://www.amazon.de/Cable-Matters-Multiport-Thunderbolt-Port-Kompatibel/dp/B01C316EIK/ but now I have a 2015 macbook pro instead. I'd like to use one of the thunderbolt ports for the USB-C adapter -- is there a cable or adapter I can get that will turn my female Thunderbolt 2 into a female Thunderbolt 3, and therefore attach the adapter (with ethernet, usb, hdmi, etc).  Looking for product recommendation, and any information on if this would be likely to damage anything.
