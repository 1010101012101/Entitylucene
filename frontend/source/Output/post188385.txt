Split screen app for Mac? <body> I'm aware of applications such as this which allow windows to be "halved", allowing the screen to be divided up. But are there any apps out there that split the Mac screen emwithin/em applications and emwithin/em windows? I'm aware that split screen editing is available in Microsoft Word and Excel, but is there an app which is allows a universal split screen across all applications?  <answer188389> Put the same application on both sides, then select the window that you want in the left side and the other window in the right side.  <answer296222> Long press the fullscreen button, and then you will figure out the rest.  <comment222923> Thanks, but I also want to split the screen within the same window - question edited <comment374142> Welcome to Ask Different.
