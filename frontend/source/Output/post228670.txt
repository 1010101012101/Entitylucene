How to prevent terminal geometry changes when changing external display on MacBook Pro 13? <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) that I use with Dell 2711 (at home) and 2713 (at work) external displays. Usually, but not always, when I bring my Mac from work to home, and vice versa, my terminals narrow down by a couple of characters. Apple's own terminal changes to 77x24 geometry, and iTerm2 changes to 78x24 (both from 80x24). I don't open the lid in between connecting to the external displays, and the windows are not rearranged to fit the internal display.  At home my 2711 is connected through an Apple DP-DVI (dual link) adapter and an Aten KVM switch, at work I'm connected straight to the 2713 by DP. Both displays run at their native resolution of 2560x1440. The problem started with upgrading to El Capitan. I run Zooom/2 for window edge magnetism.  How can I prevent the terminal geometry change?  Thanks.
