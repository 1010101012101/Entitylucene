How to add a quick-launch icon in my Dock for a program I've downloaded? <body> I've downloaded jmeter and put it in my Applications folder.br I've made it executable.br I can cd to /Applications/apache-jmeter-2.11/bin and can run it in a terminal with   precode$ ./jmeter /code/pre  or by double-clicking the icon from the finder.  How can I add the program as a shortcut (icon) on the main application icon launcher bar ('Dock') on a Mac, similar to programs such as browsers, MS Outlook, gitx, etc?  <answer125392> When you launch it does it show an icon in the dock? If not it may be a command line program that is running inside terminal. If that is the case there are ways to make an Applescript/Automator wrap-around that will launch command line applications that should give you a dock icon.  Having never done this myself, however, I am afraid you will have to do some googling, but hopefully this points you in the right direction.  <answer125393> Such binaries can't be added to the left side of the Dock where applications are stored.  strongAdd it to the right side of the Dock instead/strong  Right of the separator:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7b7PY.png" width="100"  <answer125394> You can use AppleScript to make a code.app/code file for this (That is the only file type that can go in the left side of the dock). It is in code/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor/code and when you make a new file you can put in codedo shell script "/Applications/apache-jmeter-2.11/bin/jmeter"/code. I do this all the time for shell scripts, so I can access them easily. Then you can save and choose "app" near the bottom of the Save sheet. This will create an app file that you can put in, say, the folder above codebin/code which can be dragged into the Dock.   pre tell app "Terminal"     activate     do script "/Applications/apache-jmeter-2.11/bin/jmeter" end /pre  is what you will need if jmeter writes to the terminal.   <comment146746> +1 Yes it's run from a terminal with a `./`, so yeah I would guess some sort of wrapper is needed. <comment227509> Is this just run from the terminal? IE, how would I execute these commands from within a programming language. What Runtime.exec command could I use?
