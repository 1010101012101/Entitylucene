diskutil eraseDisk results in Error: 12: POSIX reports: Cannot allocate memory <body> I'm trying to format my usb drive that is partitioned with FAT32 by the following command in Terminal:  precode$ diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ UntitledUFS disk1 /code/pre  However, I get this output:   precodeStarted erase on disk1 Unmounting disk Error: 12: POSIX reports: Cannot allocate memory /code/pre  <answer107123> It could be likely that you are not running the command as admin (Unix root) user.  To run a command with administrator privileges use the sudo command so:  precode$ sudo diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ UntitledUFS disk1 /code/pre  The error message can lead one astray giving the impression that something else is wrong but it is likely a permissions issue.
