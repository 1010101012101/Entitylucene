Does Power Nap allow an Apple TV to access media on a sleeping Mac? <body> Do I have to wake up a Power Nap enabled Mac to stream media off of it or can I leave it sleeping?  <answer75145> This seems to work on my AppleTV 2 and MacBook Air.   Last night I turned on the AppleTV to browse my main library on a Mac Mini and the MacBook Air library showed up as well, even though the lid was closed and the computer was asleep.   I have not experimented enough to know if this works with the power adapter unplugged.   This was a very pleasant, but apparently undocumented, feature to discover. Perhaps it arrived in the most recent AppleTV update.  <comment66103> I believe Power Nap is only relevant if you use flash-based storage. Are you streaming off an SSD drive?
