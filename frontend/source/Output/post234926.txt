Bootcamp Windows 7 stuck in 'Installing Updates'. Windows Resuming so can't get to safe menu <body> I am using OSX version 10.10, I used Bootcamp to install Windows 7. I attempted to restart Windows and it stuck on Installing Updates 1 of 19 for about half an hour. I pressed the power button, I'm able to get into OSX but when booting Windows, Windows resumes and goes to the Installing Updates screen. Is there a way to terminate this or clear the state of Windows from Mac so I can get back to work?  Thanks  <comment287252> Are you trying to "get back to work" using the OS X or Windows operating system? <comment287253> I am able to get into OSX. Windows is stuck in Installing Updates. I'm trying to boot into Windows. <comment287256> You have to wait for it to finish... that's if you didn't break it by hard power-off it halfway through. If you did, you need to try force it into recovery... not sure how you do that on bootcamp,. as there's no recovery partition for Windows, you might need a recovery USB stick. <comment287258> It wasn't going to finish, it was stuck on 1 of 19 for 30 minutes. I saw quite a few reports of this hanging for hours. Where could I read about a recovery USB? Thanks. <comment287274> At this point, Windows 7 is an fairly old operating system. The number of updates must be extremely large. The chances you will install all updates without error is very low. You would be better off investing in a product like Winclone so you can backup Windows 7 periodically while installing updates. This will allow you to backup when something goes wrong. Or, install SP1 (if necessary) and then immediatlly upgrade to Windows 10.
