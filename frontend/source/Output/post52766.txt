OS X Lion - Chrome Search freezes <body> I've had a problem for 5 months :(.  I open a new tab in Chrome and begin searching by typing something in the URL bar. Then, Chrome begins to freeze. I strongForce Quit/strong Chrome. I open again and begin typing the URL bar again and again I get the same freezing.   I tried to update, do a full remove and clean install but I couldn't solved this problem.  A video of this problem: http://www.screenr.com/du08  <comment60383> Just to be sure I understand correctly - in the video it appears that repeatedly pressing `i` freezes Chrome. Is that the only time it freezes? <comment62809> Yes that is `i` <comment62919> This sounds like a Chrome bug. <comment62939> I don't think it's a Chrome bug - I'm running Chrome on my MBP with Lion and I'm able to press `i` several times without it freezing. TeknoSeyfo, are you on the latest versions of Chrome and Lion?
