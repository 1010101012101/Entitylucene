How do I submit sticker apps in itunesconnect? <body> Apple just released the GM seed for Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/download/  In the sticker app submission details here: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/sticker-submissions/ I am unable to find how I can submit a sticker app through iTunesconnect.  This is what I see when I click the code+/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJCl3.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there supposed to be a codeNew Sticker App/code link? Or are sticker apps supposed to be created under codeNew App/code?   <answer251880> They're just considered a codeNew App/code according to this Apple page: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/imessage-app-submissions/  It looks like they're just considered Apps for the purpose of submission on iTC.  It states, in part:     strongSticker pack app/strong. This is a basic sticker pack made up of images or animated images, which you donâ€™t need to use code to build. You can list it in the Stickers category and in relevant Stickers subcategories on the App Store for iMessage.brbr   strongiMessage app./strong Your app can include stickers, text, video and audio. You can also use code to add functionality such as Apple Pay and in-app purchase. Choose to list your app in the Stickers category or another relevant category on the App Store for iMessage.   I also found this info on their FAQ page:     strongHow do I create an iMessage app or sticker pack in iTunes Connect?/strong   From My Apps, click on the plus sign and choose New App. Then, select iOS app and complete the required metadata. You can find more detailed instructions in the Creating an iTunes Connect Record for an App section of the iTunes Connect Developer Guide.
