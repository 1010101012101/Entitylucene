iTunes sort tracks in ascending order  <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJhbf.png" alt="enter image description here"  See how it tracks are listed out of order? 2, 1, 3, 4? I want iTunes to sort the tracks in ascending order but I don't know how to make iTunes do this.  <answer48554> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KJRdx.png" alt="Sort by Track index"  <answer53347> If you click on the "track number" column as explained in another answer, it will just change the order in which the tracks are strongdisplayed/strong in iTunes; if you have problem with the order in which they are strongplayed/strong, you should also check that all tracks have the same "Album Artists".   I found the trick here, and it solved the ordering issue I had on my iPod.
