I have a iOS 7 iPad. I am stuck on Guided Access <body> I am stuck on Guided Access on my iOS 7 Apple iPad. Help ?!?!  <answer176027> You can end a Guided Access session  ul liTriple-click the Home button./li liEnter the Guided Access passcode./li /ul  If that doesn't work, you might need to restore the device or get the hardware fixed (assuming the home button is the failure and not that you don't know the passcode).  <comment207716> now how did that happen to you ? <comment207718> Please provide more detail... who enabled the Guided Access?  What have you tried doing already?  Has it done this before? ... ? <comment207735> I have found holding the home/power button down until the Apple logo appears to be an effective fix when there is a malfunction.
