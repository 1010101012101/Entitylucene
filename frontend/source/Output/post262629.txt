Macbook Pro 15'' early 2011 - external monitor 27'' with DVI connection <body> I want to buy an external monitor for my Macbook Pro (15'' early 2011). I would want a 27'' with 2560x1440 resolution but I have a doubt: a mini diplay port/DVI converter is sufficient or I will need this one? Mini DisplayPort/Dual-Link DVI http://www.apple.com/it/shop/product/MB571Z/A/adattatore-da-mini-displayport-a-dvi-dual-link   the description of the adapter says:     Use the Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter to connect your Mac to a 30-inch display that includes a DVI connector, such as the 30-inch Apple Cinema Display HD, and enjoy the ultimate widescreen canvas with a resolution of 2560 by 1600 pixels.   Hardware specs for my model say (https://support.apple.com/kb/SP620?locale=it_IT&amp;viewlocale=en_US):      Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors   Thank you for your anwser.  <answer262742> If you want a resolution of 2560x1440 and you want to use DVI, then you strongemmust/em/strong use a Dual Link DVI adapter.  Period.  A Single Link DVI connector will only support up to 1920x1200.  That said, I wouldn't reccomend going with Dual Link DVI but rather getting a monitor that natively support Display Port or mini Display Port like the Dell UltraSharp U2715H  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7v06N.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am a big proponent of the idea that the less you have to convert, the better the reliability.  <comment329291> thank you very much for your answer; my Macbook has the thunderbolt port, so I think that a miniDP /DP cable would be sufficient, am I right? <comment330444> Yes.  That's correct
