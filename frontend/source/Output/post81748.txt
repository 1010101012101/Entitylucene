How to unmask the SIP credentials in the Zoiper VoIP application? <body> Is it possible to unmask the SIP credentials stored in the Preferences of the Zoiper VoIP application ? I couldn't find any password unmask application for that and I can't find the password in my Keychain.  <answer81749> From zoiper.com:     Use the password recovery option to reset your password. You will receive your new password by email.   Once changed the password becomes applicable for all your certificates.    This password is to be used for activation and reset of your Zoiper certificates. It is not part of your VoIP account credentials.   <answer103455> ul liGo to the folder that Zoiper is installed/li liFind the file zoiper.cfg which is essentially an xml file/li liYour SIP username and password are located between code&lt;account&gt;/code and code&lt;/account&gt;/code./li /ul  <comment94234> Which application? <comment94236> Zoiper (VoIp phone) <comment94237> So you are basically asking how to recover your password for Zoiper?
