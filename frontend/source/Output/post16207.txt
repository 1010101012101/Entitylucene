Where can you find out to whom a given Mac is registered? <body> Is there a place in the OS that we can see to which person the OS is registered to?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BcEfE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer16210> I don't know whether the registration information is stored locally. If you call Apple, they can certainly tell you under which person the Mac is registered.    <answer16212> The registration information that you enter when you setup OS X is stored in a hidden plist file in the system.   That data is stored the file /var/db/.AppleSetupDone if you run the following command in terminal you should be able to see that information:   precodesudo cat /var/db/.AppleSetupDone /code/pre  This will show you the information entered. You will need to modify this information with a plist editor. For warranty claims Apple will know who registered the machine for AppleCare.
