finder is very slow to show files in yosemite 10.10.3 <body> After the update to Yosemite 10.10.3 finder takes a long time to show the files.

To start, open Activity Monitor and quit all the apps you have running except it. Watch for 60 seconds and then make a screen shot of the window for reference.  ul liCommand Shift 4 - the cursor changes to a cross/li lipress Space - the cursor now snaps the window/li liclick on the activity monitor window/li /ul  Grab snaps of CPU / Memory / Energy and then again 5 minutes later.  If Finder is still slow - post your results and/or let us know if you need help deciphering what Activity Monitor is doing. Based on what's busy (or what's not busy) - you can then dig into which Finder folders and views are not snappy.  <answer189872> I also faced a very, very slow Finder.

Therefore follow the next steps./li liRestart your laptop holding kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appears./li liChoose to repair the disk./li /ol  <comment216845> Also - for me. I pay attention to Memory Pressure alone. What tasks are using is almost never important unless you have pressure and want to know what apps to tune or quit. Under Energy - I sort by Avg Energy Impact descending. CPU I sort by % descending. Also be sure the View is All Processes
