Is the camera in the new iPad using "4S optics"? <body> Apple's website merely identifies it as a "5 megapixel iSight" camera. MacRumors claims that Apple is reusing older parts. I recall reading that the new iPad has a better camera than prior models, so I'm confused. Which one is it? Advanced optics or not?  <answer44208> No, the iPhone 4S has an 8mp camera.  The prior iPhone 4 had a 5mp camera though.  But, yes, the older iPad had a much worse camera - less than 1mp.  This would seem to show it's from the iPhone 4: The new iPad camera: we've seen it somewhere before  Megapixels aren't everything - but the new iPad certainly has the best camera in an iPad so far. The front facing camera isn't that great though, even with the rear one hugely improved.  <comment50233> It has been [confirmed](http://www.chipworks.com/en/technical-competitive-analysis/resources/recent-teardowns/2012/03/the-new-ipad-a-closer-look-inside/) that the rear camera of the iPad 3rd is in fact the same as used in the iPhone 4: "Omnivision OV5650, 1.75 um pixel pitch, 5 MP back illuminated CMOS Image Sensor"
