Payment method for family sharing still part of a former family sharing? <body> I left a family sharing group a few months ago, and promptly joined another. In that time I did not try to make any purchases, until today. When I tried to buy an in app purchase, I was redirected to where I had to enter the security code. However, it was the security code for the former family I left.  How can I change this?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fijr1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment364781> ahh sorry for all the photos i was on mobile and confused by the fact i couldn't see the pictures <comment364784> How did you leave the previous family group?  It looks like either you didn't leave the previous family group correctly or something when wrong when you did it.
