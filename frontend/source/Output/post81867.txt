How to clean up emails when replying in plain text? <body> I have a problem that I want to solve after many years of using Mac OS X Mail.app... I generally like to send plain text emails that are full width (format=flowed) and nicely indented for quote levels. When I receive emails that are in HTML my problems begin. I have the option of switching them into plain text embefore/em I hit reply (using alt+cmd+p) or emafter/em I hit reply (using shift+cmd+t). emPlease no replies telling me to answer rich text emails with rich text replies. I want my cake on this one./em  If I switch to plain text embefore/em then generally the plain text will be wrapped to a specific width and also, in some cases I'll get lots of "" where there should be vertical line quote indents.  If I switch to plain text emafter/em then I may loose a lot of the quoting levels. What I want is to be able to end up with clean flowed plain text replies with nice quote levels.   Has anybody else seen this behaviour or seen a plugin/app that can solve these issues?  <answer94665> I haven't seen a good universal solution, but have found that by selecting only the bare minimum text I need to reply to, I can often get a clean, clear reply that doesn't need substantial (or even any) clean up when replying in plain text.  Sadly, the best solution for presenting these emails cleanly is a powerful email client like elm. BBedit, Safari's reader and Coda 2 are all in my toolchain for taking a complicated HTML document and thinning it down but it's awkward to send the text to a second program, operate on the document and then get it back into a reply using Mail.   I wish I could serve you up a delicious cake of a plug in, but sadly, the Mail plug in scene isn't lucrative and this use case doesn't have a champion that's programming a better converter than the one Apple has provided.  Of the reviews of plug-ins, these are the best:  ul lihttp://www.tikouka.net/mailapp//li lihttp://www.macworld.com/product/collection/6866/mailaddons.html/li /ul  And if QuoteFix won't work for you, you may have to program this yourself. It might do the trick by deleting trailing spaces, but without a sample of your mail in question, it's hard to tell.  <comment94386> vertical line quote indents are created by the receiving mail app.  The actual underlying code is always "", "", etc. So I don't think it matters at the other end if you are only seeing the latter when you are composing. <comment94403> Hi Tom, that's not my experience. For example, in some cases, especially when replying to rich text using rich text, I see a mixture of vertical line quote indents *and* "". Then things get screwed up. <comment94427> I thought you were asking about replying using plain text.  Perhaps it would be good to post a screen shot of what you are seeing when you switch to plain text before you reply, etc. <comment110269> (Isn't it a pity that we have to specify cake.) <comment110958> If you could link to a specific email you want help parsing, that might help. Sadly, rich text and html encoding ads so much complexity that a general purpose plug in is not available. I'll share my solution as an answer - but it's more a workaround and not a true all-powerful gadget that can fix all emails. <comment112793> +1 for QuoteFix. I usually set it to quote only the last email to keep replies/forwards clean and use the **Show related messages** features when I need to track the message history. That along with composing in plain text only, the way I think mail was meant to be (although I may be part of a minority), makes e-mailing quite productive. <comment288936> Copy and paste to a format less field (App, or whatever) then paste back. This removes formatting (plain text in other words) and won't add "".
