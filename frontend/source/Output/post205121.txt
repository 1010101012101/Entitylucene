iOS 9.1 - Can't clear "documents & data" and "other" with restore - can it be done? <body> I am trying to clear the 3+ GB of space occupied by other and documents and data on my iPhone 5S, running the new iOS 9.1 (13B5110e)  Usually I would do this by restoring the phone through iTunes and then restoring from a backup...but when I try that I get this message:  "Problem downloading software. Requested source was not found."  How can I clear these out in the version of iOS?  <answer205133> You should be able to "erase all content and settings" by using the settings app on the iPhone and then re-choose from the choices:  ul lirestore from an iCloud backup/li lirestore from an iTunes backup/li liset up as a new device/li lirestore from Android /li /ul  The error message you mentioned is typically a result of not actually running iOS 9.1 on the device (or whatever build you were in the process of installing. You can verify the exact build of iOS on the phone from the settings app  general  about  It also could be that iTunes wants to see if it can get a newer OS than what it detects on the device. In that case, just put the device into recovery mode.  ul liPower off the phone/li liPlug it into the Mac while holding the home button until you see the recovery screen /li /ul  <comment247349> Discussion about what's on or off topic should be discussed in [chat] or on [meta] <comment247350> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/29002/discussion-on-question-by-sizzle-ios-9-1-cant-clear-documents-data-and-o). <comment247357> Thanks for the response. I mentioned the version and build in the post,  iOS 9.1 (13B5110e). I do not see an option to "erase all contents and settings." Isn't that what the restore does? <comment247360> So - after erase all content - do you receive the prompt I mentioned? <comment247361> ahhh...in the phone, not in iTunes. I have just erased. Will then try back yup <comment247363> restore is in progress <comment247385> i have restored the phone...everything seems to be okay, thus far. Thanks for the help.
