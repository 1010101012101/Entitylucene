Turn on bluetooth via terminal/command line <body> How can I turn on bluetooth via the terminal / the command line?   <answer35619> There is an answer over at Superuser. The last post there is what I found to work best, in a slightly different form. The 'checkbox "On"' did not work for me, but the following code did:  precode# This is only necessary, if AppleScripts are not yet allowed to change checkboxes tell application "System Events" to set UI elements enabled to true # Now change the bluetooth status tell application "System Preferences"     set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preferences.bluetooth"     tell application "System Events"         tell process "System Preferences"             # Enabled is checkbox number 2             if value of checkbox 2 of window "Bluetooth" is 0 then                 click checkbox 2 of window "Bluetooth"             end if         end tell     end tell     quit end tell /code/pre  You can execute this script using osascript.  Update: I now changed the script to just enable Bluetooth. No toggling anymore.  <comment40555> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8343/is-it-possible-to-disconnect-a-bluetooth-connection-using-applescript <comment40723> Awesome. I have put this into a shell script and added `osacript SCRIPT` in front of it and at the end `SCRIPT` and it works fine! Thanks <comment54459> Can you add at the bottom the old code to toggle? <comment54465> Andrew: just remove the if around the "click checkbox 2...". That should do the trick.
