Wired Network Connection getting auto configured IP Address <body> I recently did a clean install of Mountain Lion and experiencing strange behavior with my wired Ethernet connection.  It cannot obtain an IP address from DHCP, where the wireless strongcan/strong, against the same DHCP server (router).  I have not tweaked any network defaults or even enabled sharing in my network settings, so I'm thinking it must be something new in Mountain Lion.  I haven't hit the threshold of the DHCP reservation range.  <comment103378> I've got a similar problem with my Mac Pro: wired connection can't pull IP, but wireless can.
