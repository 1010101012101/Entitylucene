solution to easily embed skim notes doesn't work <body> My question is directly linked to the thread Make Skim save PDF&#39;s with embedded notes by default  What if the proposed solution (https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/166794/180243) doesn't help? As in, I worked my way through all steps, but when I press command + s it still saves normally rather than embedded.   I just found out I lost 200 hours of carefully made annotations, and I really want to avoid that from ever happening again.  Please help.  Skim version 1.4.18 running on El Capitan  <comment287907> Welcome to Ask Different. Could you link to the answer that you followed? There are three of them - just use the share control from the answer and the edit control here to show what you tried. Also - be explicit about what "doesn't help" means. Do no annotations save? What version of skim app and OS X? <comment287908> Updated my question. Thank you for the suggestions.
