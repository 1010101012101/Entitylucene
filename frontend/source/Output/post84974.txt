What's the aperture or sensor size for a FaceTime HD camera? <body> I'm working on a project where I need to convert from pixels to mm and need to find the aperture or sensor size on the FaceTime HD Camera.  Specifically, I have the mid-2011 27" iMac.  I can't seem to find any detailed technical specifications on the newer FaceTime camera.  Anyone privy to these details?  <answer85020> On the iMac's features page it is stated that:     The built-in strong720p/strong FaceTime HD camera lets you make video calls that are so clear, it seems like everyoneâ€™s in the same room.   This means that the FaceTime HD Camera can offer you a strong1280x720/strong resolution as a stronghardware maximum/strong, but, it's the software you'll be using it with, which will emdecide/em the resolution.  <comment97899> If you use the camera to take a picture of a ruler, you can then measure the distance between the glass covering the camera and the ruler to make a start on your project. However, unless you are controlling for the 3D position and alignment of whatever you are measuring, you might find distortion and off-axis positioning have measurable effects on the image rendering even assuming you have a parallel placement of whatever you are measuring (both vertically and horizontally). <comment97913> I'm using OpenCV for the project.  Specifically, I'm looking to find the apertureWidth and apertureHeight parameters for the [calibrationMatrixValues](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html#calibrationmatrixvalues).  Rereading the documentation, it looks as though these parameters are poorly named as they're actually looking for the physical width and height of the sensor. <comment97932> Makes sense - we will be a good place for people to help document what hardware is used, but if you want to ask that exact code level question on our coding site, [Stack Overflow would be a good place to ask if other developers have found good values you might be able to reuse rather than engineer a solution.](http://stackoverflow.com/about)
