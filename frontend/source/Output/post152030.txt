How to periodically run a script/command when a specific application is being used? <body> I would like a certain applescript to run every 10 seconds but only when a specific application is being used (i.e. both being the front application AND the mouse or keyboard being used in the last few seconds).  How can I create such a trigger?   <answer152211>   This runs codesay a/code if the time since the last HID (pointing device or keyboard) event is over 3 seconds and if the frontmost application is iTerm:  codewhile sleep 10;do [[ $(ioreg -c IOHIDSystem|awk '/HIDIdleTime/{print $NF/1000000000;exit}'|awk '$0&gt;3') &amp;&amp; $(lsappinfo visibleProcessList|cut -d\" -f2) = iTerm ]]&amp;&amp;say a;done/code  Different ways to get the name of the frontmost application:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codelsappinfo visibleProcessList|cut -d\" -f2 lsappinfo find ASN=$(lsappinfo front)|cut -d\" -f2 osascript -e 'name of app (path to frontmost application as text)' osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to name of process 1 where frontmost is true' /code/pre  <comment178911> what application? what osx? what hardware? do you have the script already? <comment178917> you might be interested in http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/ <comment179124> You can create a Cron task by AppleScript when the application is opening. And the Cron task would call an AppleScript every 10 seconds. <comment179166> fantastic, thanks!
