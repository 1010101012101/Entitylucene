Is there a mirror? Howto download without getting security trouble?  <answer236112> Adf.ly is basically an Ad page which will show the real link after some seconds. That's the direct link for the file you are looking for:  http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/combo/builds/WineBottlerCombo_1.8-rc4.dmg  <comment288856> Temporary de-configure your proxy. When a proxy server is off, and OS X is still configured to use it, then it will show a can't connect.
