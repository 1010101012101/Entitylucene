Getting PHP response om my Mac OS X 10.8 <body> I've tried to install MAMP (also the "manual version of these things) but I haven't got any PHP enabled response from my web server yet....  Running MAMP and loading localhost/index.html returns "It works!"  Well that's nice - if it were true... I've tried to load my own index.html file into MAMP/htdocs (default folder) and to load the same into the sites folder. Both locations will return the test part of the file, but not the response from e.g. this file:  precode&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt;  &lt;?php echo "Hello World"; ?&gt; test &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; /code/pre  The only result here is "test" - what am I missing here?  <comment84846> It might be helpful if you detailed what commands you ran (and the resulting output if possible) to get to this point. It's been a while since I've done any AMP stuff, but it seems like Apache may not be configured with PHP support. <comment84848> Have you tried changing the filename to index.php? Apache may not be configured to process PHP code within HTML files. <comment85026> It seems like it's serving files with the .php ending fine. How do I change the setting so apache will serve HTML files including php too? <comment119497> *`How do I change the setting so apache will serve HTML files including php too? `* - http://stackoverflow.com/a/4892577/1287812
