ScriptEditor application signed but not accepted by Gatekeeper <body> I created a small AppleScript app to launch a webservice locally using the built-in PHP webserver. It's an interface to generate XML configurations.  Since macOS Sierra those apps are moved to the AppTranslocation directory if they are not signed. I just became an Apple Developer to be able to export the script from strongScript Editor.app/strong as an app, signed with my Application Developer ID. Yet, when I push everything to Github and download the package as a zip file, the signed app is still executed from the AppTranslocation directory. What might be the issue here?  <answer252359> Consider distributing your application within a code signed disk image, codedmg/code, file. The contents of a code signed disk image are not subject to “Gatekeeper Path Randomization” (GPR).  See How do I create a nice-looking DMG for Mac OS X using command-line tools? for a guide to creating a disk image.  <comment314015> Brilliant, thanks. I'll give that a shot and let you know the outcome. <comment315200> Thanks again for your answer. I managed to make it work by codesigning the app generated by **Script Maker.app** and codesigning the dmg as well. The final command I used to generate the dmg is `hdiutil create -size 35m -srcfolder /path/to/source/dir -fs HFS+ -volname AppName /path/to/final.dmg`.
