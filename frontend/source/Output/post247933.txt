How do I get rid of this item in my menu bar on macOS <body> So I have this "Citrix Receiver" item in my menu bar and I want to remove it. I have looked to see if I have an app in my system by that name and there is nothing. I did a search and nothing comes up. I have used "App Cleaner" to search for it and try to clean it and nothing.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iug8e.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6VKG6.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can someone please tell me how I can get rid of it? It won't even open when I click on "Open Citrix Receiver". It is unresponsive. Is there a way I can remove it?  <answer247935>    To uninstall the Citrix Receiver for Mac, open the   CitrixReceiver.dmg file and select Uninstall Citrix Receiver.      After uninstalling the Receiver emand rebooting the system/em, ensure   that the files or folders listed in this section have been removed   from your system. If they still exist, remove them manually.      /Applications      ul   liCitrix Receiver.app/li   /ul      /Library      ul   li/Internet plug-ins/CitrixICAClientPlugIn.plugin/li   li/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.AuthManager_Mac.plist/li   li/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ServiceRecords.plist/li   /ul      /Users/Shared      ul   li/Citrix/Receiver Integration (entire folder)/li   /ul      ~/Library      ul   li/Internet plug-ins/CitrixICAClientPlugIn.plugin/li   li/Application Support/Citrix Receiver      ul   liCitrixID/li   liConfig/li   liModule/li   /ul/li   li/Preferences/com.citrix.receiver.nomas.plist/li   li/Preferences/com.citrix.receiver.nomas.plist.lockfile/li   li/Preferences/com.citrix.ReceiverFTU.AccountRecords.plist (added in 11.6)/li   li/Preferences/com.citrix.ReceiverFTU.AccountRecords.plist.lockfile (added in 11.6)/li   /ul      ~/Applications      ul   liUnder this folder, you can delete any applications you previously added via the Receiver UI./li   /ul      /private/var/db/receipts      ul   licom.citrix.ICAClient.bom/li   licom.citrix.ICAClient.plist/li   /ul   To get to some of these locations faster using Finder, hit kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd (or use menu emGo  Go to Folder.../em) and paste the location there.  More info on the Citrix website.  <comment305949> Maybe something in the KB Document will help you find where that's loading from.
