On iOS 8, how do I turn on spell check without turning on Auto Correct? <body> On iOS 8, how do I turn on spell check without turning on Auto Correct? I just want the red line to appear on words. But autocorrect is terrible and ruins most everything I say. So I just want spell check only. But when I turn off autocorrect then spell check turns off also. How do I fix that?   I'm on iOS 8.3 on a 5S.  <answer181297> codeSettings/code ➙ codeGeneral/code ➙ codeKeyboard/code:  Turn off codeAuto-Correction/code  Make sure codeCheck Spelling/code (at the bottom of that same screen) is on  Your iDevice will no longer automatically correct misspelled words, but it will highlight them for you. As far as I know this is the only way to have spell-checking on without the Auto-Correct feature.  <answer206883> Turn on autocorrect, then turn on Check Spelling. Then turn off autocorrect again. That might turn on spell checking without autocorrect.  <answer213589> Go to your keyboard settings and add "English" to your keyboards. The red line will detect misspelled English words.  <answer234105> Predictive was off. Turned it on and now I have my spell check back. And I turned auto correction off.  <answer235225> I tried all above but it didn't work - finally turned off predictive and turned on and now my spell check is working   <comment215569> did you try "Settings--General--Keyboard--Predictive. Turns off" and it is not working <comment215788> It's actually "Keyboard" not "Keyboards" but thanks! The "Check Spelling" option is off the bottom of the screen on iOS 8. I don't know why they had to hide it down there :(
