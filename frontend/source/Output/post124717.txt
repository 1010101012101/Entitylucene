How to have spotlight index .tex files? <body> I want spotlight to index my .tex files and show them as possible results when I search. I imagine the solution would work for any extension, but right now I only care about .tex  <answer126930> TexShop should ship with a Spotlight importer that does the job.  If not, you can try this homemade solution:  https://email.esm.psu.edu/pipermail/macosx-tex/2013-May/051009.html  <comment148694> Yes, it is included into MacTex, which I prefer to use. <comment148938> Thanks for the link, I am testing this now.
