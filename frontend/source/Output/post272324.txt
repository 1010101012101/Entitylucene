Tap on iPhone from Mac <body> I have an iPhone 7 and I have a Google Cardboard that doesn't have a magnetic clicker. I would like to use an app, but it requires me to either tap the screen or use the VR clicker to click. Can I setup some sort of "tapper" on Mac so when I click a key on my Mac it taps the screen of my iPhone? (Software Program)  <answer272340> It's not possible for an application to control an iPhone in this way without jailbreaking due to iOS restrictions.  If the device is jailbroken, you may be able to install a VNC server on the iOS device like Veency and use Screen Sharing on the Mac such that you can click on the Mac and the click will emulate a tap on the iOS device.
