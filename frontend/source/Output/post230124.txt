XRG: How to minimize? <body> XRG system monitor is awesome!  But I can't figure out how to minimize it. I'm sure I'm missing something simple.  Any ideas?  iMax El Capitan 10.11.3 XRG 2.0.0  <answer230135> Glad you like the appâ€¦  To minimize the XRG window, just double-click on the title bar.  This will be either on the top or right side of the window depending on which graph orientation you are using.  <comment280898> Works like a charm.  Thank you, sir.
