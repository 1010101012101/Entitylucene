Ran Repair Disk on Boot Camp partition and Windows won't boot <body> Unfortunately I accidentaly hit the REPAIR DISK while my Windows 7 bootcamp partition was selected. Since I have Tuxera NTFS, the button wasn't grey out and I thought at the moment I was repairing the OSX partition. Yes, dumb as hell and now I have to pay for being careless.  So the repair disk ran for roughly 2 minutes until I realize it was the Windows 7 partition. So I cancelled it. Tried to boot on Windows seven and all I have is the blinking underscore for a few moments, then instant restart. Everytime.  So here's what Ive done so far to try to fix it:  ul liReset SMS/PRAM/li liDisable Tuxera/Unmount Windows partition/li liRun Windows Repair disk and go through Startup Repair, Chkdsk /f C:, bootrec stuff (rebuild bcd shows 0 installations), system restore to previous point (cant finish due to errors and shows "Unkown" at the top the window). /li /ul  None worked.  Disk list on OSX shows me this (I have no idea if that is right or not):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LGCO9.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fix that partition? I still have access to the Windows files with Tuxera, so maybe I could manually replace the damaged files? Or maybe a terminal command could fix it?  Open to any suggestions (besides clean install obviously).
