Car dock interference on 6s <body> I bough one of these (xcarlink) to be able to listen to spotify and podcasts in my car. After installing it I have some static when listening to pod casts and other things with non-continuous sound. (difficult to hear while music is playing, although I am sure its there)  ul liMessing about with the phone with nothing playing I noticed that the static stops completely when on the home screen, showing icons./li liWhen I click a folder there is static that matches the transition of the folder opening and stops as soon as the folder transition stops./li lisame deal when closing a folder/li liwhen any app is opened there is masses of continuous static./li /ul  Any ideas what is causing this? The xcarlink provide a 30 pin connector, I bought a 30 - lightning (genuine) to convert it.  How / Why would the transition on the screen cause static on the car speakers, and is there something I can do to stop it?  Has anyone ever noticed something like this with other house stereo docks?   h3Edit/h3  I have found some similar cases it seems
