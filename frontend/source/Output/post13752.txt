iTunes is sometimes "Connecting to Store" again and again <body> iTunes is showing this "Connecting to Store" alert. I know this is caused by the cover-search when I add new songs. But sometimes it happens when starting the app, it stucks and says "Connecting to Store" again and again. Most of the time I have to close the App.  Any solutions?  <answer103577> ol liGo to strongiTunes/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongStore/strong./li liUncheck strongAutomatically download album artwork/strong./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2K6ZY.png" alt="iTunes Store Preferences → Automatically download album artwork"  <comment14611> Can we assume that you have an active Internet connection when running iTunes?  Try unchecking "Automatically download missing album artwork" in iTunes preferences and let us know if that helps. <comment25470> I unchecked the option and now it has stopped. Thanks for the help. <comment49851> Do you happen to have a proxy server? <comment121885> @grgarside thnx for the edit, makes it look so much nicer ^_^
