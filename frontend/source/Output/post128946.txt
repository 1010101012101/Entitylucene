Prevent Gmail signatures from syncing between iPhone and iPad <body> I am trying to setup my email signature for my Gmail app on both my iPhone and iPad. However, whatever I setup on on my iPhone defaults on my iPad and vice versa.  Is there a way to work around this?  <answer128947> Your signature is synced between your devices and there is currently no way around this other than not using a signature and adding it yourself to each email.  <answer128948> It looks like Gmail only differentiates between desktop and mobile signatures:     You can create a mobile signature that will only be used when you send emails from the Gmail app. (Link)   Obviously, emmobile signature/em applies to any mobile device with a compatible Gmail app.  <comment150967> Create one online and do not check the 'mobile signature' on your iPad and iPhone?
