Wireless Keyboard not working with Mac Mini <body> I have the Apple Wireless Keyboard and a very recent Mac Mini. The keyboard exhibits very strange behaviour: meta keys / shortcuts such as CMD+TAB work, but none of the main letters do. Caps lock doesn't light up. Cursor keys work. Has anyone else experienced this problem?  <comment114983> Did you try new batteries already? <comment114984> @patrix: yup, and battery level is reported at 100%
