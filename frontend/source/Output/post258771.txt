repeat actionscript in Sierra? <body> Could you help me fix the following script?  I have an actionscript which I use within Automator to pad any size image thrown at it into a square canvas. In other words, you need not feed it the literal dimensions of the longest side and then tell it to match the other dimension with the same pixels. (For 3000 images that would take up as much time as exporting each one manually.)  Up until Sierra, this script would work for any number of images that I threw at it, whether I told Automator to act upon selected images, images within a folder, or if I specified the images from within Automator. Now when the script begins, it opens a Finder window requesting for me to select a single item.  (And choosing multiples from within this window will not solve the issue, as the script is looking to process one item per iteration.) In other words, the script runs once then ends. I'd like to know how to get it to run for number of items need, and I'd like to know how to make the script work without requesting items from a Finder window, particularly if I already used Get from within Automator to choose the items in question.  So it is clear that the script is behaving differently now, not the workflow in Automator. And to further test this, the script could just as easily be run from the AppleScript Editor, but it does the same thing.  Here's the script in question:  precodeset this_file to choose file without invisibles -- indicate the proportions for the pad area set H_proportion to 1 set V_proportion to 1 try     tell application "Image Events"         -- start the Image Events application         launch         -- open the image file         set this_image to open this_file         -- get dimensions of the image         copy dimensions of this_image to {W, H}         -- calculate pad dimensions         if H_proportion is greater than V_proportion then             set the new_W to (H * H_proportion) / V_proportion             set pad_dimensions to {new_W, H}         else             set the new_H to (W * V_proportion) / H_proportion             set pad_dimensions to {W, new_H}         end if         -- perform action         pad this_image to dimensions pad_dimensions with pad color {65535, 65535, 65535}         -- save the changes         save this_image with icon         -- purge the open image data         close this_image     end tell on error error_message     display dialog error_message end try /code/pre  <answer258782> If I understood your question, you do not want it prompting for the files to act upon and you want it to act upon all specified files, the following will do that.  ul liIn strongAutomator/strong, create a new emWorkflow/em.

Whether I add a single graphics image file or multiple graphics image files and or a Folder full of graphics image files they are properly processed when the Workflow is run and there is no prompting by Finder as I'm using a **Get Specified Finder Items** _action_ **not** a **Get Selected Finder Items** _action_. Which means you have to specify the target(s) before you run the Workflow not select them as part of the running Workflow. <comment323766> @James Levine, You can also Drag & Drop the target(s) from Finder into the **Get Specified Finder Items** _action_, not necessarily have to use the Add button. Thus allowing adding multiple targets simultaneously. Then you run the Workflow and it does process the files for me under macOS Sierra just fine and without error. <comment324042> I'm so sorry to add extra trouble for you. And I deleted my initial response. Yes, this works. I utterly overlooked the adjustments to the script and only factored in the changes to the workflow. I really appreciate this. A big cheers to you!
