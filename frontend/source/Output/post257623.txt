How to output sound as stereo to HDMI using VLC? <body> Sometimes, when I connect my MacBook (MB Pro Mid 2014) via HDMI to my receiver, which is hooked up to my TV, or hook it up to my TV directly, the sound that's played from VLC is incorrect. I'll hear only background sounds and not voices, and I'm pretty sure it's because the audio in the source file is in 5.1 surround, but I only have stereo speakers.  How can I tell either macOS or VLC to output stereo?  When opening System Preferences - Sound, and selecting the HDMI output, it tells me "The selected device has no output controls", so I can't change the number of channels.  VLC also doesn't appear to have any settings like this.
