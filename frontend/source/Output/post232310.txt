How to Install Octave in El Capitan? <body> The new GNU Octave 4.0.1 was released March 23, 2016.  I would like to find some standard way to install it in El Capitan (mine OS X 10.11.3) because it has significantly better support in some functions than Matlab, discussed in the thread here.  I do codebrew search octave/code and get  precodehomebrew/science/octave    Caskroom/cask/octave       Caskroom/cask/xoctave     /code/pre  where one of the first two should be a correct one. The project's homepage support for OS X is down here about eminstalling Octave on OS X systems/em.  There is also ruby's way of installing Octave described in the thread How to install Octave on OS X (Yosemite) but for Yosemite.  I would like to find some standard way of getting Octave for OS X.   I do successfully codebrew update/code and codebrew upgrade/code before the commands. My Homebrew is 0.9.5 (git revision 80d1; last commit 2016-03-24).  user1256923. I run codebrew info octave/code but I get  precodeError: No available formula with the name "octave" /code/pre  hr  How can you install Octave in some standard way for El Capitan?  <answer232313> From my homebrew:  precodebrew info octave homebrew/science/octave: stable 4.0.0 (bottled), HEAD high-level interpreted language for numerical computing   https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index.html Not installed /code/pre  and  precodebrew cask info octave octave: 3.8.2-1 Octave https://gnu.org/software/octave/ Not installed /code/pre  codexoctave/code is a gui which I suspect is independent.  I'd use codehomebrew/code for the installation.  FWIW the Octave wiki it explains what to do:  precodebrew tap homebrew/science brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade --all brew install octave /code/pre  <answer238677> if you have already installed gcc...  pre sudo chown -R (username):admin /usr/local/lib/gcc/ /pre  and  pre brew install octave /pre  after this, you make cross fingers...  <answer251288> Using MacPorts ( http://macports.org/ ), with insight from instructions at http://blog.hani-ibrahim.de/en/octave4-mac-os-x-el-capitan-install.html (as well as http://blog.hani-ibrahim.de/en/octave-mac-os-x-el-capitan-install.html and http://blog.hani-ibrahim.de/en/octave4-upgrade-via-macports.html) as well as the Octave wiki at http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_MacOS_X#MacPorts  It seems as though MacPort's default codeatlas/code variant doesn't play nice with Octave, and codearpac/code and codeqrupdate/code also have issues with their default installion, needing specific "variants" to properly build. Basically to get all of Octave 4 running, I did:  precodesudo port install atlas +gcc5 sudo port install arpack -accelerate+atlas+gfortran  sudo port install qrupdate -accelerate+atlas+gcc5 sudo port install octave -gcc5+gfortran-accelerate+atlas+docs+fltk+graphicsmagick+java-gui-metis-qtgui+app+qt4gui+sound /code/pre  Probably some of the octave variant flags are unneeded for some people, but I went with the options suggested by hani-ibrahim.de and it works for me to get command line Octave up and running, as well as giving a nifty Octave.app in the /Applications/MacPorts directory.  If you need Java support with the Java variant (+java) as above, you probably need a JDK (Java Development Kit) to get the necessary command line suff for that magic to work, so go to ( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/index.html ) for a download. Maybe the smaller JRE (Java Runtime Environment) would be sufficient, but I have installed the full JDK. Omitting the (+java) flag removes this requirement.  I just tested it (2016/09/01) on Mac OS X 10.11.6 and was able to intall via MacPorts with no errors, ending up with atlas @3.10.2_2, arpack @3.3.0_3, qrupdate @1.1.2_4 and octave @4.0.3_0  On about 2016/12/05, with just the xcode command line tools installed (not the full XCode), I was able to use the above to install on macOS 10.12.1 Sierra: arpack @3.3.0_3, atlas @3.10.2_2, qrupdate @1.1.2_4, and octave @4.2.0_1. I initially was not able to get 4.2.0_0 installed, but 0_1 finally did. The installation ended with the warning "unless octave is run with –no-gui-libs, graphics_toolkit(“fltk”) will cause a crash" but I have not investigated this issue.  <comment292769> "Make cross fingers" love it. <comment292770> With mine I have to run `brew install homebrew/science/octave` <comment299328> This is because you didn't tap homebrew/science <comment331244> In MacOS Sierra, this doesn't work, I had to run: `cd $(brew --repo); git fetch; git reset --hard origin/master` and after that: `brew install homebrew/science/octave` and it's working now, more infor here: https://twitter.com/MacHomebrew/status/763686348041641984 <comment331612> Hi @calbertts did you mean to put this comment in the "homebrew" answer? <comment331614> I've tried with all the answers, and this one worked fine until the  latest command, that's why I'm sharing what I had to do to make it work. <comment331864> Hi @calbertts, MacHomebrew and MacPorts are totally seperate package managers, so invoking "brew install" to fix a non working "port octave" is a bit like saying "The instructions on how to fix the squeeky screen door with the Philips screwdriver did not quite work for me. What did work was to knock a hole in the wall on the other side of the house and mount a different screen door there using a Robertson screwdriver". If you installed Octave using brew, perhaps you might want to uninstall the MacPorts stuff to eliminate duplication or possible conflicts/confusion when updating or invoking.
