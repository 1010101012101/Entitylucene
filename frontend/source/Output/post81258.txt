Reinstall Google Chrome on iPod Touch 4th generation <body> Is there any way to completely reinstall Google Chrome on a 4th generation iPod Touch? I want to restore Google Chrome back to its default settings, because it started crashing after I started syncing it with my Google account.  <answer81259> Yes, you can do this by:  ol liTapping and holding on an app icon on the home screen until the icons start to wiggle./li liTap the "x" icon on the Google Chrome app./li liOpen the App store./li liGo the the farthest right tab - "Updates"/li liAt the top will be "Purchased"/li liScroll to Google Chrome and tap "Install"./li /ol  After deleted the Chrome app, you can also just search the app store for "Google Chrome". When the Chrome app is displayed in the results, there will be an "Install" button. You can install it from there as well.
