Command and Option keys not working on one keyboard (not hardware) <body> I am using a PC keyboard on my Mac. Today, it stopped recognizing the Command and Option keys.  This likely happened because I experimented with Karabiner and Yosemite Modifier Keys yesterday.  I have tried:  ul liResetting modifier keys to defaults./li liChecking private.xml through Karabiner (blank)./li liUndoing my settings on Karabiner./li liUninstalling Karabiner entirely./li liRestarting OS X./li /ul  None of these things have worked. Keyboard Viewer is not registering key presses on Cmd (Windows key) or Option (Alt). Any ideas?  <answer228562> I opened "Keyboard Preferences" and clicked on the Modifier keys. Clicked on "Restore to defaults". And the modified keys started working again. After that I switched the modifier keys back to my preferred set. And things are still working. Feel quite good. It saved me an avoidable reboot.  I am in such a similar issue often. The problem used to get fixed after restart (probably will also work, after logout/login -- did not check). Today it happened again. I tried the defaults method above and it worked.
