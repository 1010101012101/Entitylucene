How to export annotations in iBooks for Mac? <body> I've been using iBooks to read code.epub/codes that I've downloaded from the Internet, and made many annotations in them.  How can I export the annotations to another Mac, or share them all at once?  <answer158501> I think there are two options.  This app is still not yet released http://www.compendiumsapp.com/  The other technique involves an app called Digested. I took the hint from here http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/beyond-highlighting-how-to-get-the-most-from-your-annotations--cms-20013 and should work for your other Macs.     ...sync your iBooks with your iOS device, and use the Digested app to   copy the annotations back to your Mac. It's a roundabout way, but it   does work.
