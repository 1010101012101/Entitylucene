How to change boot picture of Windows partition? <body> On a MacBook with Bootcamp installed, I got three partitions:  ul liOS X 10.10/li liWindows 10/li liOS X Recovery/li /ul  On boot, with 'alt' key down, I get the bootloader and I can choose which partition to boot.  On this screen, how to change the Windows (or OS X Recovery) picture?  <answer179402> I agree that you should test rEFInd using a flash drive. I see one can download "A USB flash drive image file" containing rEFInd. I believe you would be better off using my instructions. If you have any problems with my steps, let me know.  h1Steps to Install rEFInd on a USB Flash Drive/h1  ol liDownload "A binary zip file" from The rEFInd Boot Manager: Getting rEFInd page. I assume this will be saved in your Downloads folder./li liInsert a flash drive into a USB port. Open the Disk Utility application and partition the drive as follows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9cv7i.png" alt="enter image description here"  The format of the second partition does not matter. I happened to use MS-DOS (FAT). Before applying changes, click the Options... button and make sure "GUID Partition Table" is selected.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3EIR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Apply the changes and quit the Disk Utility./li liOpen the Terminal application. Enter the following commands. You will be prompted for your log in password.  precodecd  downloads/refind-bin-0.8.7 ./install.sh  --ownhfs  /Volumes/rEFInd  --alldrivers /code/pre  This is what appeared in my Terminal window.  precodeLast login: Fri Apr  3 01:53:35 on ttys000 Steelhead:~ davidanderson$ cd downloads/refind-bin-0.8.7 Steelhead:refind-bin-0.8.7 davidanderson$ ./install.sh --ownhfs /Volumes/rEFInd --alldrivers Not running as root; attempting to elevate privileges via sudo....

Installing rEFInd to the partition mounted at /Volumes/rEFInd Copied rEFInd binary files  Copying sample configuration file as refind.conf; edit this file to configure rEFInd.

This delay was strongnot/strong needed once I installed rEFInd on my internal hard disk. I assume you will need this temporary delay as well. This is accomplished by editing the coderefind.conf/code file. Enter the following commands to edit the file in the TextEdit application.   precodecd  /Volumes/rEFInd/System/Library/CoreServices open  -e  refind.conf /code/pre  At the bottom of the file, enter a line containing codescan_delay 5/code, as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RPlZN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Save the changes and quit TextEdit. If you get the following message, just click OK.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JHHRc.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liRestart the computer. You should boot to the rEFInd boot manager. The menu that appeared on my computer is shown below.

If you find any of this useful, let me know. The next step would involve installing rEFInd on your internal hard disk. I do not yet know enough about the partitioning of your internal disk to answer the questions I have. Mainly, I need to see the output from the commands given below.  precodediskutil list disktuili cs list sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  None of these command change your computer. They only produce partitioning information.   <comment212535> I do not think you can change the pictures. I know the text can be changed.  For example, the bless command can change the text for the OS X recovery partition. If you really need to have different pictures, I would suggest installing the free rEFInd boot manager on a separate partition. Then you can significantly alter the actions and appearance when booting. If interested, let me know. <comment212542> @DavidAnderson I already have a custom picture for my OS X partition. I might try *refind-flashdrive* first. Is *refind-bin* uninstallable and you can return your computer back to the state before install if I were unhappy?
