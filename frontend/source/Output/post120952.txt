Forward slash doesn't work when in terminal... works in every other application <body> I'm trying to use terminal and in every tab I open, when I try to change directory such as         precode   cd / /code/pre  I get a beep and am unable to type the character.  I am on the same computer and am able to type a slash in this webpage, just not in that bash shell  I don't have any key-remapping software enabled.  How can I type a forward slash , or determine what is preventing me from typing it?  When I type "shift-/" I get a question mark, so I know the basic essence of the key is working.  Copying and pasting a "/" character results in a beep as well  When I connect an external bluetooth keyboard, the same results happen for both keyboards (on the laptop and on the keyboard)  Yes I rebooted.... many times  <answer120992> Let's try a few things.  First, make sure "Secure Keyboard Entry" under the Terminal menu does not have an arrow next to it.  Second, go to Terminal  Preferences  Settings  Keyboard and make sure that forward slash is not defined in the list. Under 'Advanced' make sure 'Declare terminal as:' is set to one of the xterm settings, preferably 'xterm-256'. In the same dialog make sure 'Character encoding:' is set to 'Unicode (UTF-8)'.  Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts and make sure that '/' is not set to do anything in 'Services' and 'App Shortcuts'.  Now try it and see if you still have the same problem.  <comment141083> I'm going to accept this as an answer, I was in a crisis mode and had to have it ready in hours... so I reinstalled from scratch.  Other strange things were happening too, like it wouldn't shutdown, or start up with extensions off (shift key).  With extensions off - before it just rebooted - it took at least 3 min before it crashed/rebooted. <comment141084> I did all of what you mentioned except the Advanced tab, or check the UTF encoding.  Will look into that in the future.  TY! <comment315401> Not working for me, I cannot use / in terminal. And also cannot find ~ on any kayboard osx offers me. Also I cannot find application Character viewer that was in last osx versions.. Well Nice macbook but so a lot of stupidities.
