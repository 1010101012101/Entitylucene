Update iPhone NOT to latest version <body> I have an iPhone 4s with an iOS 7.1. I wish to update my phone to iOS 8 or 8.1 because most apps only support 8 or higher. I do not however want to update to the latest version supported on the 4s (iOS 9.3.5). Is there a way I could update by phone to iOS 8 and not iOS 9?  <answer262473> What does strongSoftware Update/strong in Settings show you? If it is iOS 9 then I'm afraid you can emnot/em upgrade to 8 via this route.  You cannot download iOS 8 unless Apple decides to start signing it again.  <comment328894> why the downvote? its a good answer, kinda thought not being able to update to IOS 8 was an obvious one, guess not. I mean oP could have used google, would have saved us the bother.
