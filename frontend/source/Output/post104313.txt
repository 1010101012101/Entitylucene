Macbook Air hard drive crashed, download Lion without paying again? <body> 2 days ago my girlfriend's MacBook Air crashed (mid 2012, running OS 10.8), only showing the infamous "folder" icon.   Usual stuff did not help, reboot pressing alt, cd, etc. We went to an Apple Store and they told us that the hard drive was dead, which would cost us... $1000. I guess they think it's dead because after booting it from an external hard drive they could not see the hard drive using Disk Utility...    Of course I can't / won't pay that amount of money...  So my first step is to install OS X Mountain Lion on a USB key/external HD. For some reason when I launch the AppStore with my girlfriend's account, I have to pay again to download it, is it normal or is it because she did not register her Mac?  I guess my second step will be to boot the mac from that USB key/external HD and then try to see if the hard drive is really dead. If yes that brings me to step 3: finding a compatible hard drive on ebay. Do you have any brands to recommend? I already found some pretty interesting deal but I thought I would ask before buying anything...  Thanks in advance, any help is more than welcome,  Niko  <comment122782> Download it with your account, but do not install ! copy the installation file to a USB ! <comment122783> or this http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4854 <comment122784> or this http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/26/install-upgrade-os-x-mountain-lion-multiple-macs/ <comment122800> Are you sure it was $1000 - I had a hard disk replace in the IK and it was $200 and they aplologised saying they knew it was expensive but they did not have other things in stock
