Can't figure out how remote share is getting automounted <body> I have a NAS that stores the music files for iTunes. There is an automounted share on the NAS that iTunes goes thru to retrieve the music files. For the life of me I can't figure out how the automount is defined. I need to change NAS units, and therefore need to change the share mount.  The share is mounted to /Network/media and looks and acts like an automount. (Comes and goes on demand.) The /etc/auto_* files appear pristine, yet...  precodesol:etc sjf$ sudo automount -vc automount: /net updated automount: /home updated automount: /Network/media updated automount: no unmounts /code/pre  shows  that /Network/media is  being controlled by automount   /etc/auto_master...  precode# # Automounter master map # +auto_master        # Use directory service /net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers    -fstab /-          -static /code/pre  and /etc/auto_home...  precode# # Automounter map for /home # +auto_home  # Use directory service # # Get /home records synthesized from user records # +/usr/libexec/od_user_homes /code/pre  There is no /etc/fstab, but there's an /etc/fstab.hd. It only contains...  precodeIGNORE THIS FILE. This file does nothing, contains no useful data, and might go away in future releases.  Do not depend on this file or its contents. /code/pre  The mount I want to change is...  precodenas2.controlsoftcorp.com:/media on /Network/media (nfs, nodev, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) /code/pre  What am I missing?  (currently using 10.8, but need to solve this issue on 10.9 too.)  <answer115438> Well the answer is that it is entered using Directory Utility.
