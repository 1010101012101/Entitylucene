Antivirus that runs only by request <body> I just want a lightweight antivirus for my Mac that doesn't keep running on background but only scanning a file by request. Is there any?  <answer50479> I personally use Sophos Antivirus. You can disable On-access Scanning from within the configuration settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MGqrN.jpg" alt="On-access Scanning"  <answer50480> h2ClamXav (free/donationware)/h2     Scan only the files you tell it to or your entire hard drive,   whichever you prefer.
