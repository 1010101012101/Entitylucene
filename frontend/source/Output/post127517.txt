How can I add this line on Pages? <body> How can I add this line on Pages? Is there a shortcut? I can only repeat press kbd-/kbd.  If this is not possible on Pages, similar layout will also be OK.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSqka.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer127518> You can add a rule to strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Text/strong and have it replace code---/code by any number of dashes you’d want.  <answer127520> I don't know if it's possible in Pages directly, but you can add a text shortcut for the line.br This can be done in Settings.app via Keyboard - Text.  <answer127530> kbdoption/kbd + kbd-/kbd gives you an em dash (–) if that is what you are asking.  <answer127532> You can have Pages automatically add a line across the whole page, the formatting options (dash size etc.) are rather limited though:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mor8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You can also use the fill option when setting tabs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T1UIo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
