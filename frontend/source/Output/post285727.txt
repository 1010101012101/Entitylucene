Gray screen - Macbook Air 2008 <body> My Macbook air 2008 seems broken? It displays an Apple logo at start up - hard drive has a copy of OSX Lion 10.7 on for new user, and then a user with a password was created. It works to the apple sign, then just displays blank. I have tried SMC which is does, and PRAM but no luck. It worked with another drive I tried straight to the user login page, but now it just doesn't. I'm not sure what to try? Does anyone know if this is a permanent issue? Thanks  <comment360421> Try running in [Safe Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262) or(hold Shift while booting) or [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314) (hold Cmd-R). Also try running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.
