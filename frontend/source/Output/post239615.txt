Prevent Keychain from copying an internet password to my login keychain <body> I find that my passwords are being copied from my "bank" keychain into the login keychain every time I allow Safari to autofill the fields. How can I prevent that?  I have created a separate keychain called "bank" to store my sensitive financial account passwords. I use a different keychain password and set it to lock automatically after 5 minutes.  <answer277719> This was a security bug and a fix was released today by Apple.  About the security content of Safari 10.1:  strongSafari Login AutoFill/strong     Available for:  OS X Yosemite v10.10.5, OS X El Capitan v10.11.6,   and macOS Sierra 10.12.4      Impact: A local user may be able to access locked keychain items      Description: A keychain handling issue was addressed through improved keychain item management.      CVE-2017-2385: Simon Woodside of MedStack   <comment345822> Short answer, its by design in Safari. All passwords saved in Safari will be stored in the default/Login keychain. I could suggest using an app (such as 1password) instead and not letting Safari manage/autofill passwords at all. <comment345972> I created a Radar for this and I recently got an email from Apple (on Feb 27) that they have fixed it in a security update (presumably upcoming).
