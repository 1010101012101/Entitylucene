What bitness is Mountain Lion kernel, because `uname -p` returns `i386`? <body> I know, the answer should be 64, as Apple dropped support even for their early 64 bit models BUT:  precodeNathan-der-Graue:~ max$ uname -p i386 /code/pre  while on the other hand: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FOgWe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Could someone please explain this to me?  <answer58230> Per: http://lists.apple.com/archives/Darwin-dev/2009/Aug/msg00211.html  You want codeuname -m/code rather than codeuname -p/code to determine the bitness of the kernel.  precode$ uname -m x86_64 /code/pre
