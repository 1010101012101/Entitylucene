Why am I being charged again on my iPod Touch for an app I purchased on the iPad? <body> Why am I being charged for apps I already paid for on my iPad? When I go to my iPod touch and download it there it charges me even though I paid for it on the iPad. I only have one iTunes account.   <comment59563> Which app is the culprit (or has this happened multiple times)? Just to eliminate possible causes, are you certain this is a universal app, or could the iPhone/iPod Touch and iPad versions be separate apps, as is sometimes the case? <comment59566> thank you. its happened more than once, but I bet your right and the versions are separate apps. Annoying but makes sense. I'll see if thats it. <comment59575> Also: When you have already purchased an app, but then want to download it again, you have to click the "BUY" button before it tells you there is no charge...
