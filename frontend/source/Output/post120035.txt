Insert MathType Equation is disabled in Numbers <body> I am running Numbers 3.1. When I try to select the Insert  MathType Equation... option, it is disabled.  There doesn't seem to be anything in the help related to this feature.  How can I use this menu option?  <answer120048> You might want to make sure the MathType application is running before you invoke the Insert  MathType Equation option. I read about it here and tested it on a Mavericks Mac at work a few minutes ago.
