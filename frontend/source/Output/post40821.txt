How do I get Finder windows to reopen on start up? <body> I just got my new computer with system 10.7.2 and this is really bugging me. I like having a few Finder windows always open. When I shut down and then start up my computer the next day, all the windows I had opened in the Finder are closed save one. It always just has a single Finder window open. If I have 5 windows open when I shut down, I want all 5 of them open the next day. How do I make this happen? I can't stress this enough. The windows won't stay opened on restart.  In the general preferences I have the "Restore windows when quitting..." button checked. When I shut down, the "Reopen windows when logging back in" button always remains checked. I can find no other mention anywhere regarding windows maintenance and it's driving me nuts! This should be a no-brainer but I can't find any way of correcting this situation. It seems everywhere I look on-line, people are having the exact opposite problem.  <answer43799> There might be several answers to that.  ul liYour restore for finder could be corrupted somehow. Delete the code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState/code and give it a try/li liYour finder app may be configured NOT to restore the windows. Try this: codedefaults write com.apple.finder NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool true/code/li /ul  Does your other apps have the same behaviour? Have you tried with another username to see how it goes?

I've even tried to delete the Finder preferences files and nothing changed. The Finder spaces options also doesn't stick.
