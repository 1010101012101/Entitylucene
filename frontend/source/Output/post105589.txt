Is it possible to hide the address bar and status bar in iOS 7 Safari? <body> Is it possible to hide the address bar and status bar in iOS 7?  In a landscape app I'm currently using the below code to do it for previous iOS versions and it work well even on IOS 7: when opening the page it goes full screen and stay so.  JS:  pre class="lang-javascript prettyprint-override"codewindow.addEventListener("load",function() {     // Set a timeout...     setTimeout(function(){         // Hide the address bar!         window.scrollTo(0, 1);     }, 0); }); /code/pre  HTML:  pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"code&lt;!-- For iOS web apps --&gt; &lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"&gt; &lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black"&gt; &lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="AMC Walking Dead Story Sync"&gt; &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"&gt; /code/pre  The fact is that on iOS 7 iPhone and iPad when tapping the bottom of the screen the address bar and status bar appear and the only way to get rid of it is to change the phone orientation and then change it back to the previous orientation.  Is there anyway to avoid that manipulation?  <answer114215> strongThere is a method: code&lt;meta name="viewport" content="minimal-ui”&gt;/code/strongbr (embut it only works on iOS 7.1 - not on 7.0 nor 8.0/em)  source: StackOverflow   hr  More details, from iOS 7.1 beta 2 change log and release notes:     strongSafari Notes/strong      A property, minimal-ui, has been added for the viewport meta tag key   that allows minimizing the top and bottom bars on the iPhone as the   page loads. While on a page using minimal-ui, tapping the top bar   brings the bars back. Tapping back in the content dismisses them   again.      For example, use code&lt;meta name=”viewport” content=”width=1024,   minimal-ui”&gt;/code.   hr  strongupdate:/strong I confirmed this method works in iOS 7.1 (official final release). You can confirm for yourself with my web app, which uses the meta tag solution described above.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yYgqI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer125483> I've seen this recommended code&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"&gt;/code It runs the site in standalone mode, which hides the UI. I'm unclear on how this compares to the minimal-ui solution above. I am under the impression this solution works for iOS versions before 7.1 as well.  <comment124157> Many answers on this already http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18813476/is-it-possible-to-hide-the-address-bar-in-ios-7-safari <comment124197> I don't see an answer on SO that's more working than the example code here. Hmm... <comment133871> I'll wait for final release then to give a try, then I'll accept your answer. Thanks a lot. <comment147640> This solution only work for web page you add as an app to your home screen. <comment157759> Hmmmm.  I'm using 7.1.1 and your web app linked above does NOT hide the address bar etc when loaded.  Did they break it in 7.1.1? <comment165680> This has been removed in iOS8. <comment198579> Check this post about IOS8 implementation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24889100/ios-8-removed-minimal-ui-viewport-property-are-there-other-soft-fullscreen
