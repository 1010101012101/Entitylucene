How I can install a Homebrew recipe maintained in a separate git repository outside of /usr/local/Library/Formula? <body> I'm writing a quick Homebrew formula for my own private purposes (it's unlikely to be shared). I'd like to install it , but would prefer not to maintain my own local fork of Homebrew, but instead outside code/usr/local/Library/Formula/code (it happens to be within an existing private git repository I have, but I think that's incidental to the question).  I've tried:  ul licodebrew install ./my-formula.rb/code/li licodebrew install file:///Users/myusername/mygitrepository/my-formula.rb/code./li /ul  Neither seems to work. Instead I see:  codeError: No available formula for my-formula ==&gt; Searching formulae... ==&gt; Searching taps... /code  How can I install this formula?  emNote/em: Installing the formula using git repository syntax is unlikely to be what I need - I'm looking to install the formula emduring its development/em, in other words before I commit to my git repo.  I am using Homebrew 0.9.5.  <answer214289> precodeln -s /Users/myusername/mygitrepository/my-formula.rb /usr/local/Library/Formula/ brew install my-formula /code/pre  Both codebrew doctor/code and codebrew update/code shouldn't mind, at least not until a codemy-formula/code formula is added into the official brew repository!  <comment258656> Have you tried using `brew install -f my-formula.rb`? <comment259209> Harry, unfortunately that fails with `Error: No available formula with the name "my-formula"`. <comment259210> This works, thanks. It's not ideal since it still involves touching `/usr/local/Library/Formula`, and I'd like to keep the formula entirely separate from homebrew's own repo, but it does work. Thanks!
