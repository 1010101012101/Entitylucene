How to record both screen and sound with Quicktime on El Capitan? <body> I'm trying to record both what's happening on screen and the audio being played by the applications. To my surprise, QuickTime did not record the sound. I believe it worked before in previous OS X releases, but that is not something that I use often so I have not bothered to try earlier.  What is the current situation on El Capitan ? Have I messed with something that prevents QuickTime from capturing the sound, or has it never worked ?  Here is my view of Quick Time  / New Screen Recording on a Mac Mini: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fTReT.png" alt="enter image description here"  On my Macbook Pro, I have the option select None or Internal Microphone. Internal microphone actually records the speakers of the Mac Book as heard from its own microphone, which obviously sounds terrible.  This is a MacMini 7,1 (late 2014) and there is nothing in Input Sources.  <answer212834> When you are in the recording screen window, at the right of the red button you must see an arrow, click on it and you should see the audio input dialog. Tested now with OS X 10.11.1  <answer212953> You can also use SoundFlower for this. In a way, it acts like a microphone, which makes it possible to select it as an audio source in Quicktime.  <answer213055> If you want to record the audio generated by your running applications etc. you will need to use SoundFlower or something similar. It's available free from the AppStore.br If your internal microphone is glitching out and you just want the system to recognise the hardwares presence again; try simply plugging some headphones or something into your 3.5mm TRRS audio jack.br I had the same problem the other day and thought the actual soundcard was fried but just making that quick contact brought it straight back online.  <answer213305> You  need to install Soundflower in order to run it on El Capitan. El Capitan requires kext to be signed in order to load them. This one gets its kext installed in /Library/Extensions/.  This is due to System Integrity Protection  Then, you have to create a multi-output device with: Audio MIDI Setup.app, which is found in /Applications/Utilities/ :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5kjb.png" alt="enter image description here"  Finally, when you want to do the actual recording, make sure you use this multi-output device, and capture from the same Soundflower device used in this multi-output device. Otherwise, you can't both listen to and capture the sound, because it goes directly to soundflower without being copied to the built-in output.  alt/option + right clicking on volume gives you this menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TosU6.png" alt="enter image description here"  and Quicktime now looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uABhN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer219942> Of course you can use QuickTime to record both screen with audio, and you need to install a virtual sound card like soundflower to capture computer sound. Besides, you can also try to use screen recorders like ShowMore (free screen recorder for Windows and Mac), Jing (5 minutes' recording limitation) and many more to do the recording.  <answer237073> For those who aren't finding Soundflower in the AppStore, tracking down the correct downloads for this semi-dead project can be kind of tricky.  I installed the Kernel Extension from here: https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases (Note that to follow the instructions for Audio MIDI Setup, I Had to choose codeWindow &gt; Audio Setup/code)  Then I installed SoundFlowerBed from this fork: https://github.com/mLupine/SoundflowerBed/releases  That puts an item in the menu that allows you to set SoundFlower (2ch) -- Built-In Output, which then makes "SoundFlower" available in QuickTime Player etc.  <answer242695> Dont bother with installing software or extensions. Just plug an aux cable (male at both ends) into the headphone jack and the other end into the mic jack.  <answer263906> For those wanting to record their voice or the sounds coming from the speakers...  No extra software is required.  You just need to click the little arrow to the right of the record button and change it from codeNone/code to codeInternal Microphone/code.  Not sure why this is defaulted to None but I was caught by surprise when I changed from an old Macbook to a new one with a fresh OS install.  Although it's not an ideal answer to the OP's desires, I'm leaving this answer here because it answers the question in the title.  <answer283833> I started using Voila--Capto. Costs money but works well and even has a feature to stop recording after a set time and other features.   http://www.globaldelight.com/capto/  <comment256993> Please, can you comment on the hardware ? <comment257016> Can you please specify which is your Mac Mini model? Is the audio Line-in port present at System Preferences- Sound- Input? <comment257297> Soundflower is not usable on El Capitan because of kext signing. Can you name the alternative softwares on the App Store ? <comment257441> What is kext signing? I'm unaware of any alternatives. <comment263121> I'm hesitant to install Soundflower because it's so old, and the newer forks on GitHub don't seem to have an official website yet. <comment263846> @Flimm Soundflower is solid. https://cycling74.com was the original developer and they are good at what they do. They are probably busy with their commercial products (i.e. Max) so don't officially support it anymore and Soundflower is unlikely to have its own website anytime soon.. However, the main author Matt Ingalls is currently hosting the project at https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower if you don't want to use the App Store. <comment266028> I wouldn't go anywhere near Soundflower on anything later than Mavericks. Kernel panics are frequent. <comment300368> This question was specifically for Mac and my Macbook pro doesn't seem to have a mic jack. I have used this very trick on a PC successfully, but needed something else for my Macbook. <comment305923> where do I alt/option + right clicking on volume ? <comment306457> The volume button is the one found in the top right corner of the menu bar. <comment311160> When I do this only the computer output is on the recordings, and not the mic. Is there a way to get them both on the recording? <comment321326> Make sure the volume  on Quicktime is down to zero, otherwise you'll hear reverberations in your audio recording <comment329588> I use Screenflick 2. http://www.araelium.com/screenflick. Best tool out there for the job. <comment330695> a.k.a Analog hole.. You will also record your cat and kids crying. Nothing wrong with that but it's just not optimal.. <comment330783> The question is about the ability to record sound, not which particular microphone you use. The important thing is to use that arrow to switch from None to whatever microphone you like - no extra software required. <comment331967> @bernie2436 if you don't see the Volume item on the menu bar, you can use System Preferences - Sound - Output tab and select the Multi-Output device <comment335626> This was very helpful for me and my early 2011 MacBook Pro. Thanks! <comment338433> OP's question says he already used `Internal Microphone` before. <comment338455> Ah - I see. I was blinded by why I originally searched for this question in the first place - I wanted to record my own voice. I can see now what the OP is asking. I've edited my answer. (I think it's still worth having here rather than deleting.) <comment343257> I'm having the same issue as @Pablote where only the computer's output, not my microphone output, is being recognized. <comment343277> @s2t2 what worked for me was using OBS instead of QuickTime, process is mostly the same. OBS has the mic always recording by default, and then you can add an audio output capture (I think that was it's name), and pick Soundflower in it. <comment345437> @Pablote what is OBS. Can you share a link please? <comment345571> @s2t2 https://obsproject.com <comment347208> @Pablote looks cool but i couldn't figure out how to use it.
