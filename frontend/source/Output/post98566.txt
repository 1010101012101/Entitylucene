Find out about links <body> I have a few links set up.  I can do codels -l/code and get full information about them.  For example:  Me-Machine:Links me$ ls -l ~/Links  precodetotal 8  lrwxr-xr-x  1 me  staff  64 26 Jul 23:20 jenkins_tc -&gt; /Users/me/developer/buildproj/apache-tomcat-7.0.42/bin /code/pre  I only want to see the link,   precodejenkins_tc -&gt; /Users/me/developer/buildproj/apache-tomcat-7.0.42/bin /code/pre  and not the rest of the stuff.  What would be the command for this?  <answer98735> This command:  precode    stat -f "%N%SY" symbolicLinkName /code/pre  will produce the output:  precode    symbolicLinkName -&gt; linkedFileName /code/pre  (-f is the "format" option for "stat".  The %N in the format is the filename of symbolic link and the %SY is the way to print out the name of the file it points to with the string " - " before it. (The S usually means to print the field as a string but it has the special meaning for "Y", the name of the file pointed to, which adds the arrow before the file name.)
