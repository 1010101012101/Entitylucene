How can I pause the download on Mac App Store and then resume it later? <body> I am downloading macOS Sierra from Mac App Store. But I have electricity problem here. Due to which my iMac will lose power after 2 hours. Now I want to pause the downloading so that I can resume the download later on. How can I do that?  Here is a screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1rQqx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer254173> Open Launchpad and you will see your downloading app. Simply click on the app icon to pause the download, and click it again to resume.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D3ago.jpg" alt="launchpad showing paused download"  <comment316369> There's no need.  If you shut down your Mac because of power issues, it will automatically pause. When you restart, it will automatically resume.  The key here is that downloads in the App Store will not prevent you from shutting down your computer. <comment316371> Actually I asked this because Safari also do not have any options for resuming download and it starts from the beggining if shut downed. <comment316372> That's a different question.  In Safari, you can pause downloading by "Show Downloads" under View menu (or Option-Command-L) and stopping the download (click the X in the circle).  You don't need to pause for the App Store. <comment316373> Okay thanks for guiding. <comment319415> Good grief! This is extraordinarily hard to find. Has the Apple UI really got that bad?
