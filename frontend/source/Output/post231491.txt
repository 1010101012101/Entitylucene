terminal -bash: command not found <body> I'm trying to compile a c++ program on the Mac terminal with gcc then the source files path. I've found some short term fixes on the Internet but I want it so it works every time. Also I hardly know anything about the Terminal so can the solution be explained very simply.   codeecho $PATH/code gives:  precode/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:’/usr/local/bin:?? /code/pre  /bin/cat ~/.profile prints no such file or directory,  /bin/cat ~/.bash_profile prints:   precodeexport PATH=’/usr/local/bin:??  # Setting PATH for Python 2.7 # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave  PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}" export PATH /code/pre  When I use gcc to compile the program I get "-bash: gcc: command not found"  However if I run the commands  precodeexport PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH" /code/pre  …the terminal works. I'd like to know how to make it work without running those commands.  <answer232408> Modify the file .bash_profile with nano or another appropriate editor:  Replace:  precodeexport PATH=’/usr/local/bin:??  # Setting PATH for Python 2.7 # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}" export PATH  /code/pre  by:  precode# Setting PATH for Python 2.7 # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:$PATH /code/pre  hr  Explanation:  The first line of your current .bash_profile   precodeexport PATH=’/usr/local/bin:??  /code/pre  modifies the standard value of $PATH given by em/etc/paths/em from  precode/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin  /code/pre  to code’/usr/local/bin:??/code - which is no valid path.   The fourth and fifth line of your current .bash_profile modifies $PATH to   precode/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:’/usr/local/bin:?? /code/pre  Since code’/usr/local/bin:?/code is no valid path the finally effective PATH is   precode/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin /code/pre  which completely breaks your standard PATH. You can still execute all executables in the above directories but you can't omit the superior directories (e.g. to execute nano you have to enter code/usr/bin/nano/code instead of codenano/code).  <comment282723> On my machine running OS X 10.10.5, I find `gcc` at `/usr/bin/gcc`. I do not think you can execute `gcc` until you install Xcode. Your post does not actually ask a question. So what is the exact problem you want solved? <comment282733> @BenBeazley Please confirm the modifications made by patrix♦. <comment282766> What exactly is the problem you are facing here? Which command are you trying to run in `bash`, which error message do you get? <comment282777> Your first PATH variable is messing up your PATH.  Assuming you need /usr/local/bin, just have PATH="/usr/local/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}" export PATH" in your .bash.profile and go from there. <comment282883> The PATH variable is exported with  `export PATH`, but this won't help you if the PATH definition is wrong to start with. It also won't help you if your issue is not PATH related. So please help us help you in describing the problem you are facing with compiling C++ code, which things you've tried already and where you are stuck now. <comment282896> Ben, if you wish to comment here, you need to use the same account you used to ask the question, or use the Contact link at the bottom of the page to request account merge.
