Maximise window in OS X only using App Store extention <body> We know maximise a window in OS X (like we do in Ubuntu Unity or MS Windows) is not currently possible.

Simply dragging the tittle bar of the window to the top of the screen will maximise the window. Probably easier than clicking the small green button.
