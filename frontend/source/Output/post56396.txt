How can I solve an iPhone 4S restore failure loop? <body> My iPhone crashed while it was connected to the computer. I performed synchronization and left the phone so it can recharge. When I looked it after some time I saw Apple logo. I have tried multiple times to reset it (power + home) but every time it just stuck on Apple logo.  After some time I gave up and decided to restore it but even that didn't work. Each time it just stuck on the progress bar. Here are things I have tried:  ul lidifferent USB ports/li lidifferent sync. cables/li lidifferent machines (desktop and laptop)/li liwindows and mac/li liDFU mode/li /ul  every time same result.  Bringing iPhone to the Apple store is not an option because I am in a unsupported country without the Apple stores.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YZ72r.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xOl3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer62084> Try RecBoot from sebby.net for Mac (and Windows).  The RecBoot application lets you put your iPhone into and out of recovery mode easily.  <comment71702> Are you absolutely sure you did the DFU correctly? Had you jailbroken the phone before this point? <comment71703> As I know DFU mode is when the screen is black and iTunes recognize it and offers restore. Yes, it was jailbroken but this didn't meter before. <comment71704> Sometimes depending on how an iPhone is jailbroken or if the jailbreak has a problem, it can result in corrupted firmware, which in some cases can be unrecoverable. <comment71718> @hellothere Any reference on that? I don't agree with that. <comment71728> It's not common but I have seen it happen. Might be due to a faulty phone of course.
