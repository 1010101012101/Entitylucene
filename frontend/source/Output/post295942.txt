Where is the configuration file of the MySQL? <body> As we know, our Mac own a Mysql, under the code/usr/local/mysql/code, it is a soft link from code/usr/local/mysql-&lt;mysql-version&gt;-macos&lt;macos-version&gt;/code.  But how can I find its configuration file? because in general, the mysql configuration file is named codemy.cnf/code.  Whether or not the mysql configuration file is under the code/usr/local/mysql//code directory?  I find the directory use codefind ../mysql -name my.cnf/code   <comment373772> See this answer on SO:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10757169/mysql-my-cnf-location-on-os-x
