How can I enable and/or disable OS X's power nap feature from within Terminal? <body> I can deal with it using some command-line commands such as codedefaults write …/code etc, but don’t know what the exact command and argument names to use?  <answer116424> Use codepmset/code to change the codedarkwakes/code parameter:  precodesudo pmset -c darkwakes 1 /code/pre  The codedarkwakes/code parameter is not mentioned in the man page, but it is shown by codepmset -g/code if your Mac supports Power Nap and is operating on an AC power.  code-c/code is AC power (or charger or wall power), code-b/code is battery power, code-u/code is UPS, and code-a/code is all.  You can also edit the plist directly, but you have to restart to apply the changes:  precodesudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Set "Custom Profile":"AC Power":DarkWakeBackgroundTasks 1' \     /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist /code/pre  Or using codesed/code:  precodesudo sed -i '' '/DarkWakeBackgroundTasks/{N;s/false/true/;}' \     /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist /code/pre  <answer155983> OS X: About Power Nap The following Mac computers can use Power Nap. Some of these computers may require an SMC update in order to use this feature.  http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT5394  <comment136106> Power nap is only available on certain machines, hence it would be helpful if you would add which system and OS you have. Additionally, could you edit your question such that only one question is asked at a time? Preferably only about he power nap feature, as the other one (about the cheatsheet) is not very well suited for this site. It doesn't have a single correct answer. <comment136110> Bart, edited. And then where is the question on tutorial/cheatsheet suited? <comment136143> Thank you. With regard to the cheatsheet: I don't think a complete list of these commands exist in the first place. Secondly such a question is not really practically answerable as it is unbounded. [Here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) it's written that you should ask practical and answerable questions. So if you run into something you would like to change (like power nap) it's fine asking a specific question. You could try [Googling](http://www.google.nl/search?q=terminal+hacks) the list though. <comment137418> Thanks. Could you teach me about the possible values and its meaning of the `darkwakes` parameter? (And sorry for being a bit late to be notified of your answer...) <comment137492> I guess it's just 1 for enabled and 0 for disabled.
