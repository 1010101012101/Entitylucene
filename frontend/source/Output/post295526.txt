How I fix the profile image not being displayed on start up screen? <body> Every time macOS starts I am presented with a startup screen that doesn't display the profile image. How does one fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JXeaG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer295527> Did you set an image at the settings  users and groups?  I'm posting this as an answer to add my example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Z5qg.png" alt="users and groups"  When I'm logged out, I see this image properly at MacOS. You could try replacing the image with another image to test it.
