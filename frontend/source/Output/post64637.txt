How to remove your name from the menu bar after 10.7.5 update? <body> After the 10.7.5 update to Lion, I'm getting my name to appear in the menu bar. I don't particularly like it there. Any way to remove it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TuTPN.png" alt="image showing issue"  <answer64638> Have you changed it under Users &amp; Groups preference pane after the update?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wPK1p.png" alt="Users &amp; Groups"  Once you select Login Options in the lower left, choose icon or short name or deselect this item entirely to remove the user from the menu bar.  <answer64639> Go to System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups  At the bottom of the user list click the 'Login Options' item and then make sure 'Show fast user switching menu as ...' is unchecked.  That'll get rid of fast user switching from the menu bar for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibMBY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment75924> Ha! a skitch gunfight <comment75927> Ahhh. Login Options -- how intuitive!  Gave you the checkmark because you you were ~1 minute faster at the gun. :) <comment75928> Upvoted. Thanks for the help. <comment75929> Pew. Pew. Git yer Skitch guns out! <comment75930> WAT - I won that race by more than a minute ;-) But seriously - pick the answer you __like best__ and not just the one that was first. (you can see the times change and refresh and for some of the time mine is two minutes older and others it's only one minute older).
