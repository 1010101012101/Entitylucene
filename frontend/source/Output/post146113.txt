How to stop my texts (iMessage) from showing on my Mac <body> Whenever I send or receive messages on my iPhone they show up on my MacBook also. I was wondering how I could get that to stop?  It used to be that my texts wouldn't show up, and I could message through my MacBook also but now its just annoying and I'd rather not have my siblings creeping through my messages by reading them on my laptop.  <answer146117> Disable it in iMessages Prefs/Accounts...  [Edit] Re-reading your question, you want to be able to send from iPhone &amp; MacBook, but not have the MacBook show any conversations initiated from the phone?br Never tried that one, but perhaps by disabling one or more of the account number/email address options further down the same page.  I've always had conversations appear in both locations, Mac &amp; phone, never seen it behave any differently, unless I was in some poor reception area.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQywB.jpg" alt="Imessage Prefs/accounts pic"  <answer164235> Go to System Preferences â†’ Accounts and unclick on the iMessaging Service.br It will say it is "inactive".  This is for OS X 10.10.  <comment179108> You can temporarily disable notifications by opening the notification centre and enabling "do not disturb".
