How to fix: iMessage Unavailable: Turn on cellular data or use Wi-Fi to set up iMessage <body> My iPhone 5 suddenly ceased using iMessages. The phone is unlocked, has ios 9.3.2 installed, I have very few apps installed, and no new apps installed recently.   When I go to Settings  Messages  iMessage and try to toggle, I get the following:     strongiMessage Unavailable/strongbr   Turn on cellular data or use Wi-Fi to set up iMessage.   However, cellular data strongis/strong enabled in Settings  Cellular  Cellular Data. Cellular data seems to be working fine in Safari, apps, etc. I get the same behavior with LTE or 4G cellular.
