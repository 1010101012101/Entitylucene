Epson 1500 won't print over WiFi <body> Yesterday I installed the drivers for my printer (Epson Stylus 1500) on my Mac. During the setup I chose to connect over WiFi (the printer had already successfully been setup for WiFi printing from my Windows computer). After the installation I tested this by printing a test page and everything worked as expected.  Today I wanted to print a PDF file and following message was given in the printer status window:     The printer is not connected.   And on the document it keeps saying:     Printing - Searching for printer.   I can still print over WiFi from my Windows computer but my Mac doesn't seem to find the printer anymore. Is there any solution to this?

Reset the printer but do not allow windows to connect and test. <comment181324> I don't see how Windows would be hogging the printer. I did the setup on my Windows and printed a testpage, afterwards I connected my Mac and it worked. So I don't see how this could be the problem? Plus, how do I block Windows from connecting?
