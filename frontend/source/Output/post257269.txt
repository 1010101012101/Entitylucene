How can I clean up old notes left in my Gmail account by notes.app? <body> I keep my Notes.app notes synced with my Gmail account.  In Gmail, I can see all my current notes in the Notes label and associated sublabels.  I can also see many older versions of current notes, and previously-deleted notes, not attached to any label.  Is there any search I can do in Gmail which will reliably find emall/em messages that were created by Notes.app, so that I can delete old versions / "deleted" notes permanently?  (I can find individual notes by searching for their subject line, but I no longer remember all the subject lines of all the notes I've deleted, and I can't find any search string that will reliably find Notes.app notes which no longer have the Notes label.)  Relatedly: is there any way I can configure Notes.app so that when it removes a note (or older version of a note) from the Notes label (or a sublabel) it moves it into the trash, rather than leaving it cluttering up my messages archive?  <answer257290> It appears that the following search will find all messages created by Notes.app, and, for me at least, no messages emnot/em created by it:  precodefrom:username@gmail.com -in:drafts -in:sent -in:chats /code/pre  (Where codeusername/code is my GMail username.)  To find messages which are no longer "live" in Notes.app (i.e., are older versions or deleted notes), append a negation of the list of Notes (sub)labels, like this:  precodefrom:username@gmail.com -in:drafts -in:sent -in:chats -(l:notes OR l:notes/folder1 OR l:notes/folder2) /code/pre  Note that emyou must manually enumerate all the Notes//em sublabels corresponding to folders that you've created in the Notes.app*, otherwise you risk deleting notes that are still "live" (visible in Notes.app).  <comment321212> I'm a bit concerned that this search might in some cases catch messages not created by Notes.app, so suggestions of a better search string are very welcome!
