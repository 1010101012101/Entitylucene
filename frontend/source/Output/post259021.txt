brew couldn't upgrade after upgrade xcode 7.3.1 to 8.1 <body> I upgraded xcode from 7.3.1 to 8.1 and also I update homebrew using [brew update]. after that I could use [brew upgrade]. It shown the following warning message  Warning: You are using a pre-release version of Xcode.    You may encounter build failures or other breakages.    Please create pull-requests instead of filing issues.  I used [brew config] and it shown the following info  precode  HOMEBREW_VERSION: 1.0.8-54-g8019afb   ORIGIN: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.git   HEAD: 8019afb60ad321b0f14f60b00c23d7fb098d35c2   Last commit: 6 days ago   Core tap ORIGIN: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core   Core tap HEAD: 83f73d73fac8229ac523bf839b8a5913de05bf08   Core tap last commit: 3 hours ago   HOMEBREW_PREFIX: /usr/local   HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY: /usr/local/Homebrew   HOMEBREW_CELLAR: /usr/local/Cellar   HOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN: https://homebrew.bintray.com   CPU: quad-core 64-bit haswell   Homebrew Ruby: 2.0.0-p648   Clang: 8.0 build 800   Git: 2.9.3 =&gt; /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git   Perl: /usr/bin/perl   Python: /usr/bin/python   Ruby: /usr/local/bin/ruby =&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/ruby/2.3.1_2/bin/ruby   Java: 1.8.0_25   macOS: 10.11.6-x86_64   Xcode: 8.1   CLT: 7.3.1.0.1.1461711523 /code/pre  I think the last line of above info [CLT] means command line tools and its version is 7.3.1..., I think it should be 8.1 because Xcode is 8.1. How can I upgrade CLT from 7.3.1 to 8.1?  <answer287090> I had similar issue:  ul licodebrew/code is not up-to-date even though running codebrew update/code returns:     Already up-to-date /li liRunning codebrew upgrade/code returns:     Warning: You are using a pre-release version of Xcode.br   You may encounter build failures or other breakages.br   Please create pull-requests instead of filing issues. /li /ul  I solved running the following command:  precodecd "$(brew --repo)" &amp;&amp; git fetch &amp;&amp; git reset --hard origin/master &amp;&amp; brew update --force /code/pre  <answer291196> After upgrading Xcode you need to point the command line tools to the new version of Xcode. If you did an AppStore upgrade the command line tools shouldn't change. Try running this command:   precodesudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app /code/pre  to set up the tools again.  I install Xcode from the xip files and rename it with the version number (i.e. Xcode833.app)  So to point the command line tools to the new tools I use the command:  precodesudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode833.app /code/pre  Running that command will require you to enter your admin password.  <comment323940> did you try to re-run `xcode-select --install` already? Also: an upgrade/update should be available in App Store - you may have to start the new xcode once. As last resort you can download clt 8.1 from developer.apple.com. <comment323950> Not succeed trying resolve this problem. I'd try `rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools` and run `xcode-select --install` again, it still install the CLT 7.3, even then system upgrade told me I have an update of "Xcode Command Lines Tools 7.3", interesting
