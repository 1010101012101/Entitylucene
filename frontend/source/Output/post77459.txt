GarageBand copied from another Mac <body> I just copied Garageband on a memory stick from a friends new iMac to my older Macbook Pro which I recently updated (clean install) to Mountain Lion. Unfortunately, during the upgrade I lost GarageBand.   After double clicking on GarageBand within the memory stick on my older Macbook Pro it is now coming up with:      "Thank you for purchasing and downloading GarageBand from the Mac App store."    It then proceeded to download the rest of the app.   I'm a bit confused as to why this worked. I was wondering:  ol liHave I accidentally bought the app (even though I don't believe I'm currently signed into the Mac app store with my Apple ID)?/li liOr have I somehow just stolen my friend's version?/li /ol  <comment89764> When you purchased your computer, did it come with GarageBand? If it did, was it hard copies (CDs) or was it through the Mac App Store? Also, when you set up ML, did you sign in then with your Apple ID? <comment89767> It's possible you redeemed your friend's license for the App. Have her or him sign in and see if they have a redemption option for that App. If not, you might need to gift them the app. <comment89771> thanks for the replies, yes my laptop did come with the original ilife content however it came pre installed on the machine, i might have the disk somewhere too but i couldnt find it, hence the copying. I've signed in now and nothing appears to be up with it, my friends copy seems to be fully working too, could you explain more where the redemption thing would be not entirely sure where that would be, thanks <comment89772> Go to the mac app store app click on purchased and see if the other ilife apps are listed and available for download if so you can also download these as well.
