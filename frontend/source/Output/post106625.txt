Is it possible to have more waypoints in Maps.app on OSX? <body> Is it possible to have waypoints, or multiple destinations, when getting route directions in the Maps.app on OSX Mavericks?  I would like to change the route like one can by dragging the route in Google Maps, or by adding a waypoint of a city I want the route to go through.  Is this accomplishable?  <answer110919> I just checked into this, and I cannot find a way to make these types of adjustments.  Pitty!  <answer112265> No, so far! Hopefully, apple will add that option to the next update?  <comment333186> Your note regarding the "next" update is still entirely relevant. Two or three versions later, we are still hoping for this.
