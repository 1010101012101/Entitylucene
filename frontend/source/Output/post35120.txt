Mail-app not using Push <body> I just bought an iPhone 4S and configured my mail-accounts. But for some reason, the new mail is only pushed when I open my Mail-app. I set the settings for incoming messages to "Push". Any idea how this is possible?  I my former iPhone, an iPhone 3G, did the job excellent...  <answer35206> This may solve your issue.  ol liOpen Settings app./li liOpen Mail, Contacts, Calendars/li liUnder the Accounts heading, open "Fetch New Data"./li liBe sure that Push is set to on./li liOpen Advanced at the bottom./li liUnder each individual account, make sure that it is set to Push.  If push is not an option, then your email provider does not support push.  The only ones that I am sure of are iCloud, Microsoft Exchange, and Gmail (if setup as an Exchange account)./li /ol  <comment40103> This is an old kb article, but I think Yahoo is supported as well. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2625 <comment40145> This was my solution. Fetch was set on manual and my GMail accounts used Fetch, so only when I opened the app, the mail was Fetched! Thanks!
