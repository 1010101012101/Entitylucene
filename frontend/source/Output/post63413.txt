What determines a local file's MIME type? <body> When a local file is opened in Safari or -- more important to my situation -- a custom application that uses a WebView for display, what decides on the MIME type to associate with the resulting file URL?  I see that there are MIME registration files associated with Apache and CUPS but experiments seem to show that neither of those is used for direct file access.  <comment73671> This sounds like a development question. Would it get a better response on stack overflow? <comment73675> It's really a system configuration question, except for the part where I don't know which piece of the system to configure.  :)  As a developer, when I open a file URL, I'm told what OSX thinks its MIME type is.  In that role, there's nothing I can do to influence the incoming information.  (But, thanks, I may try S.O. just because there could be others there who have been in the same position.)
