Can't see properties panel popups/windows in eclipse <body> Is it me or is it bug in Eclipse (Indigo Service Release 1) running on Mac OS Lion , that when in XML layout design mode, when I select any property of widget, its not displaying popup nor the drop down list, which is normally displayed.  I have attached screen shot in which I am clicking the combo box but its not showing me the properties drop down.  I only can see popups by pressing "Alt/Option" key and then clicking, but its annoying. Also I am using JDK 6.  I have checked with my friend's Mac, the popups are working perfectly there without the need of pressing "Alt/option" key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJu9x.png" alt="Even I have selected a property, it should show its drop down, but its not showing"  Even I have selected a property, it should show its drop down, but its not showing
