Disabling sound output devices (e.g. Internal Speakers) in OS X <body> Since my Cinema Display is both connected through mDP and USB, I can (stupidly enough) both choose “LED Cinema Display” or “Display Audio”.  Also, I never use the internal speakers since they sound extremely tinny.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/owSzh.png" alt="My audio devices"  How do I remove/delete/disable unwanted audio devices? It must be possible somehow!  <answer186455>    kextunload is a formal interface for unloading kexts in the Darwin OS and in Mac OS X.   Unload the system audio driver:  codesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext/code  Load it again:  codesudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext/code  If not "AppleHDA.kext", another kernel extension in /System/Library/Extensions/ may be what you're looking for.  <answer208081> I don't know of any way to disable internal speakers. However, you might look into a solution like ControlPlane, which can automatically set your default audio output (and many other system settings) based on environmental factors of your choosing, e.g. having a specific display connected, or the presence of a specific WiFi access point.  <comment147339> I don't have a Mac handy (at work), but when you open Sound Preferences, I thought there was an option to remove items from there. <comment147461> @Nivas: Nope! Sadly not. The only thing you can do is select which one should be the active one. You can’t even reorder them. _ Not very Apple-y, I’d say.
