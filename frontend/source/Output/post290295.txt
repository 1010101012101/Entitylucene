How to get the Reset Password mac OS notification to disappear <body> I recently reset my Apple ID the other day, and ever since my Mac always prompts me with a notification to reset my password from my device. It was annoying me so I eventually re-reset my password just to get it to go away, but it's still showing up.   Any ideas? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SxCvI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer290326> I would try to disconnect and reconnect the Mac from your iCloud account and such services, to see if that stops the notification from showing up.  <comment366479> What do you see when you select "Show"?
