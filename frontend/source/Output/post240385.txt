How do I configure a global hotkey for iTerm 2? <body> I'm a new OSX user, and I've used Linux for the past 1.5 years, and I really can't live without dropdown terminal. So I googled, and came across this question: iTerm as a slide-out terminal from the top of the screen  However, it doesn't work for me. There's no option whatsoever like that, and there's no updated answers covering this. Is there a way to enable it, as google doesn't really help me with this.  I've included a picture of my keys tab here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xHskf.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/M6G5wCj.png"  It's not in the mappings menu either. I'm not married to iTerm, but TotalTerminal is discontinued. I did install Apptivate but it's not the same as a dropdown terminal.   <answer240434> You're in the wrong preferences. That's the Appearance settings, available with ⌘I or the Appearance tab in the app Preferences (⌘,). You should be in iTerm → Preferences (⌘,) to access the app preferences, then select Keys in the toolbar at the top.

I don't think Iterm 2's preferences have ever looked the same as your screenshot. <comment295464> Weird. I used "Get Info" from Finder, and it says 3.0.0 on the version part. But it says iTerm 2 on the label... <comment295469> It just struck me, the screenshot you posted is from the Profiles section of the preferences. **You need to go to `Preferences  Keys`** not `Preferences  Profiles  Keys`. <comment295471> I don't even have `Preferences  Profiles  Keys`, that is the `Preferences  Keys` tab I'm on <comment295472> It's hard to tell, as you have cropped some of the preferences window off in the screenshot. To clarify: [This is where you are](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6jmf3.png) **and** [This is where you should be](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1rXvk.png) <comment295479> Not really, that's the whole preferences window I got with cmd + i, I don't even have appearance, arrangements & pointer menus. <comment295490> Personally I go to the preferences with `cmd+,`, which is the `preferences` shortcut for most mac applications. Could be that `cmd+i` leads somewhere else.
