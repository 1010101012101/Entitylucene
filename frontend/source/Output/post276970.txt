What is the "System" category of Storage on my Macbook Air? <body> It seems to be taking up a lot of space, and I can't figure out what's stored there or how to clear it out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/umQ3K.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QCSqb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment348663> The sizes of the various items shown in About this Mac...  Storage are often faulty. I recommend to download and install [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com/) (free trial) and scan your volume "Macintosh HD" with admin privileges. Please take a screenshot of the initial scan and post it here.
