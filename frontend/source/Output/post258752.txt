Where does an "Export to Apple Devices" file go to in Final Cut Pro X? <body> Sometimes the most simple things in this software are not obvious. I get a "Share Successful" message but have no idea where it is on my HD.  <answer260518> When you set up your export settings and clicked ‘Next…’, a standard save sheet appears prompting you for a location to save the file. strongWherever you selected as a save location will be wherever the file is./strong  hr  Once exporting is complete, the notification has a Show button which reveals the location in Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vPXzE.png" width="378"  If you forgot the location and missed the notification, you can still reveal the location.  ol liSelect the project in the Library viewer under the event where it is located./li liShow the Share Inspector using the subimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C6Kbp.png" width="15"/sub button on the inspector toolbar./li liClick the reveal arrow next to the shared media, then select Reveal in Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLnPx.png" width="410"/li /ol  <answer288200> I clicked share to 1080 Apple device. On the next pane it asks where you would like to share - such as library. Just click the box that says do nothing. It will then ask you where you want it put. It also gives the show option. Phew Whee!  <comment323633> Have you tried searching for the file name in finder or spotlight? <comment323635> Yeah but forgot the name and cant re-export it to see the name so <comment323640> Try going to "all my files" and looking for only movie files. You should be able to see it somewhere there (note that I'm pretty sure the file will have a .m4v extension <comment323725> there are some things I really miss from windows ) @NoahL <comment329312> What would you do in Windows? <comment363780> I had the same problem, and the spotlight found a file under `~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Home Videos/Untitled Project (1280 x 720).m4v`. That's probably a good place to look.
