Why "Too many open files" error is occurred while opening a webpage with polipo installed on OS X 10.11.4? <body> I have installed codepolipo-1.1.1/code caching proxy on my OS X 10.11.4 with codehomebrew/code:  precodebrew install polipo --with-large-chunks /code/pre  Sometimes opening URLs (this page for example) is failed with this error message:  precode504 Connect to apple.stackexchange.com:80 failed: Too many open files  The following error occurred while trying to access https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114514/can-the-default-permissions-on-dev-disk-be-changed:  504 Connect to apple.stackexchange.com:80 failed: Too many open files  Generated Sun, 22 May 2016 12:36:56 IRDT by Polipo on Hamids-MacBook-Pro.local:8123. /code/pre  I have set up code~/.polipo/code file as configuration file with codesocksParentProxy/code and codesocksProxyType/code parameters only.  The value of codeulimit -n/code is code4864/code.  In code/usr/local/var/cache/polipo/code I have 510 folders and total size of this folders is code297 MB/code.  Total number of files that are open with polipo with this command is code219/code:  precodelsof -p $(pgrep polipo) | wc -l /code/pre  Why this error is occurred and how can I prevent that?  Is there any configurations that I missed to set up?  <answer249989> emThis is a quick fix answer. If you know which configurations caused this problem please post your answer/em   I didn't find out why this error occurs, but I solve the problem every time this error appears by running this command:  precode$ brew services restart polipo Stopping `polipo`... (might take a while) ==&gt; Successfully stopped `polipo` (label: homebrew.mxcl.polipo) ==&gt; Successfully started `polipo` (label: homebrew.mxcl.polipo) /code/pre  After restarting codepolipo/code instance, that error disappears.  strongNOTE:/strong This command should be executed strongOUT/strong of a codetmux/code session. In a tmux session it will not work:  precode$ brew services restart polipo ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.polipo.plist: Operation not permitted ==&gt; Successfully started `polipo` (label: homebrew.mxcl.polipo) /code/pre  If you are running such a session, detach the session with kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdb/kbd (or any prefix key combination you set) and then press kbdd/kbd. Now run that command.  strongTHE BEST ALTERNATIVE:/strong I used codereattach-to-user-namespace/code to restart polipo service directly from tmux session:  precode$ brew install reattach-to-user-namespace /code/pre  then codebrew services/code will work.  strongUPDATE:/strong I found that my local polipo cache size is enough large:  precode$ du -d0 -h /usr/local/var/cache/polipo 13.8G    /usr/local/var/cache/polipo /code/pre  There is a "purge" function that is explained here:     The behavior of the -x flag is controlled by three configuration variables. The variable diskCacheUnlinkTime specifies the time during which an on-disk entry should remain unused before it is eligible for removal; it defaults to 32 days.   So I stopped polipo daemon with brew services:  precode$ brew services stop polipo $ polipo -x $ brew services start polipo /code/pre  Now the size of local cache is reduced:  precode$ du -d0 -h /usr/local/var/cache/polipo 2.1G    /usr/local/var/cache/polipo /code/pre  And it seems that the error is gone.
