How to move dock items? <body> Options gives me  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSKyj.png" alt="enter image description here" (slack)  or  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0lofZ.png" alt="enter image description here" (chrome)  but I don't get the options to rearrange the icons in the dock.  I can't 'drag' the item either.  How can I achieve this?  I am on yosemite 10.10.2  <answer216775> One option was to uncheck 'Keep in Dock' (context-click) to remove it, then:br open the applications folder to find the program and then:br drag it to the new desired place in the dock. Finally recheck Options - 'Keep in Dock'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EHfLC.png" alt="enter image description here"   <answer216776> It's a smooth click and upward motion on an icon using your mouse or trackpad to rearrange icons in the Dock. Don't click-and-hold, click and move -- if you click and hold you'll get the option menu overlay for the application.  Tried to make a little gyfcat that shows it happening:  http://www.gfycat.com/ClearcutUnluckyAndeancondor  This irregardless of the setting for codeKeep in Dock/code on the application. In the above example I'm moving apps that have codeKeep in Dock/code set and not set. They're all re-arrangeable.  <comment262050> Ah yes, click and quickly move, got it, thx!
