iOS: Tapping Update in App Store just launches the app <body> I am trying to update my apps but cannot.  When I tap the update button in the App Store it simply launches the app, not triggering the update download.  I have a 5c running iOS 7.0  Would anyone know how to fix this?  <answer176400> Tap on the app icon to launch the full product page, and click the "+Update" button there, rather than the "Update" button on the list of updates.  The former works for me, the latter behaved for me as you described.
