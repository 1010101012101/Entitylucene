Removing email account prompts to remove from other computers <body> So I added my @att.net email address a while back and decided to remove it from OS X Mavericks Mail. When I clicked to remove it, it prompted me if I wanted to delete this email account from iCloud on this computer or on all computers. It also gave me a list of all the computers associated to my iCloud account. However, a lot of those computers don't even exist. How can I edit this list of computers associated to my iCloud account?  <answer134702> Go to iCloud Devices, sign in, click on "all devices", select the one to remove and click erase .  <comment159521> Those devices do not appear there. <comment159522> Well then I would just change my password, that would solve it too. Do the names of the devices sound familiar to you? <comment159550> Yes, they all seem like my device names but then again, they are generic like MacBook Pro or Mac Mini. <comment159556> Oh, yeah if there is standing something like yourname's MacBook Pro or yourname's Mac Mini thats totally fine, its the Apple way of naming the Devices.
