How can I send a tweet without taking my hands off the keyboard? <body> If I'm typing a tweet in Mountain Lion's new Notification Center panel, is there a way to send the tweet without moving my hands to the trackpad to click the "send" button? I've tried kbdreturn/kbd, kbdenter/kbd, kbd⌘/kbdkbdreturn/kbd, and other key combinations, but nothing obvious sends the message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5qOKC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer58048> I didn't intend for this to become a self-answered question, but I think I found the answer:  kbd⌘/kbdkbd⇧/kbdkbdD/kbd  The send mail shortcut works to send a Tweet also. Yay for discoverability.  <comment66577> In the process of trying to find an answer to this question I accidentally found a way to break the "Click to Tweet" button. I typed something in the tweet composer and then hit Esc, then the OS seemed to hang for a minute before closing Notification Center. Now I can click on the "Click to Tweet" button and it registers the click but the composer doesn't open. So, caution: don't try that combo if you care about tweeting. <comment66578> I've managed to do that several times tonight. In Terminal, you can reset Notification Center with a `killall NotificationCenter; open /System/Library/CoreServices/Notification\ Center.app/  ` <comment68289> The mean thing is that even if you change this combination for Mail.app I haven't found a way to change it for the tweet sheet. (Opened a question.) <comment68292> Good observation, @GhostLyrics <comment69336> Is there a shortcut for the "Click to Tweet" button itself? <comment69338> @RobertoAloi See [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58054/9388) — not a single key, but it can be scripted (and thus assigned a keyboard shortcut) <comment99987> You can do the whole process, from opening Notification Centre to sending the tweet, without taking your hands off the keyboard: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/86520/26500
