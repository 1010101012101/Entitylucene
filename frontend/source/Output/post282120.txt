Combine data of two or more iPhones <body> I have strongmultiples iOS devices/strong - a 64 GB iPhone 6 Plus, a 128 GB iPhone 6 and a 128 iPhone 6 Plus. I want to emcombine all the data/em on all these phones into a emsingle iPhone/em.  By data, i mean strongPhotos, Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes, Wallet, iBooks/strong. I have strongiCloud Sync/strong turned strongON/strong, but the emdata exceeds 5 GB/em (obviously), so I want to know if there is a way of doing so emwithout the Cloud/em or via the emInternet/em. Maybe strongiTunes/strong can help me somehow. I regularly strongbackup/strong my Photos to Microsoft OneDrive and Google Photos, but i doubt if they are the originals as i had captured. Especially, the panorama, hyperlapses and slowmotion videos.  I am also willing to buy a emnew 256 GB iPhone 7/Plus/em (if disk space is an issue), but i would prefer to combine the data into an existing device, assuming strongfree space is available/strong or not an issue, how can i achieve that goal?  <comment355203> If you jailbreak probably.  Otherwise I have no idea <comment355205> okay, tell me how to proceed after jailbreak <comment355206> I haven't done this until since iPhone 3GS but basically you install the app on the new phone and then copy over the settings and app data from the old phone.  You can use something like iPhone explore or at least you used to be able to.  Back then the folder layouts was quite straightforward but they may be may obfuscated/encrypted now.  There might be problems with  updating which kinda defeats the purpose of the merge.
