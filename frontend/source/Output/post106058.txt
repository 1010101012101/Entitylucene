Difference between US QWERTY and International QWERTY Apple keyboards? <body> What exactly is the difference between US QWERTY and International QWERTY Apple keyboards?  I’m talking about the hardware keyboards specifically, strongnot/strong about keyboard layouts (in System Settings).  <answer106059> The most important differences are the size and position of the Enter/Return, and a few differences in the layout. The code~/code key and the code\/code key have an entirely different position on both keyboards. Also, the US keyboard has no code€/code label (although it can be entered: kbdAlt/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd2/kbd).   The International keyboard (‘keyboard type’ = ISO) also has one more key than the US keyboard (‘keyboard type’ = ANSI).  Some Apple keyboard layouts use that key for essential characters, and this can cause problems for users with only the US keyboard.  Below is a high-quality visual comparison.  h2US QWERTY Apple keyboard:/h2  img src="https://i.imgur.com/HhDxWSV.png" alt=""  h2EN International Apple keyboard:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4xYE.jpg" alt="International English"  <answer197776> It doesn't have the alternate "upper" characters of the number keys, i.e. the pound sign.  <answer272878> Latest version from the official Apple website:  QWERTY - International &amp; QWERTY - US  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Af7l3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The link below is to the overview of all keyboard layouts that Apple provides. Might be useful.

US qwerty and En International have the pound sign £ in exactly the same place, alt plus 3.  Neither of them have it printed on the key. <comment256364> 2nd keyboard is not British, as it has # over 3. British has £. It's International English. <comment310914> I would have liked if such a Mac keyboard existed: the US layout, but with the International Enter and backslash key positions: http://i.imgur.com/Cx12P3q.jpg <comment342983> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. - [From Review](/review/low-quality-posts/195686) <comment342985> I agree with @techraf. But, maybe you can place the images of the two keyboards in question here. <comment342992> @n1000  But those images were already provided years ago in the first answer.  This answer is really kind of pointless. <comment342993> @TomGewecke Why do you think it is pointless? I agree it is more of a comment, but it points to an official Apple support document. Personally, I find that an important information for this question. <comment342995> Added the images of the layouts as well, as requested. Sorry it's 1 big image, I'm not allowed to add more then 2 links atm. <comment359900> @SorinPostelnicu what is it about the international `Enter` that you like? Mine is international English and I hate it with the passion, wishing the US English keyboards were available at the time of purchase. <comment360117> @WhatHiFi it was not clear what I wanted to say: I meant about the position of the two keys: backslash and enter. The position of the backslash in the US keyboard is really weird. (Or, to put it correctly: I am not at all used to such a position. I am used with the position of the backslash key in the bottom-left of the Enter key, not on top of it. Also, I am used with the vertical Enter key.)  But the other keys on the International keyboard I find them really weird: who the hell uses ± or § signs? And of course everyone knows that the tilde and backquote are below Esc and above Tab :D
