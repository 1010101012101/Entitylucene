Can the Xcode SDK run on Windows 7? <body> I want to install Xcode SDK for iPhone app development on my Windows 7 PC, does any one know is this is possible?  <answer79618> You can't install XCode or its SDK on the windows. All you can is create a virtual machine, install Mac OS X there and then install XCode and SDK.  <answer79619> Here is what I suggest you do:  ol liInstall a virtual machine of some kind(VMWARE or something similiar). /li liInstall Mac OS X. /li liUpdate Mac OS X./li liCreate an developers account. /li liDownload and install Xcode and iOS SDK./li /ol  After that you can just work like you usually do in Mac OS X.  <comment92055> What makes you think Xcode will work? Please have a look at our guide [ask] where it covers "do your homework" and "be specific" <comment191654> This has allready been asked.
