No option to restore system <body> I recently setup my Time Machine so I can easily restore my system if I break it.   Problem is that when I start the installer from my USB-drive the option "Restore from a Time Machine Backup" is not present.  The USB-drive I'm booting from have the Yosemite installer on it. I've also tried to hold in CMD+R during boot but it doesn't seem to work, I just get to the normal login screen.  Here's a bad image of what it looks like in the "Utilities"-menu.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiIri.jpg" alt="Utilities menu"   Anyone know what's up?  <answer153245> If this is what I believe you are asking:  At the top of you OS, you will see a clock with an arrow going round clockwise. Click that, then choose the third option down - 'Enter Time Machine'. Find your backup needed, then press restore.  Nick  <comment180509> Nope, not at all sorry! Before on Mavericks I could boot from the install USB-stick and then choose "Restore from a Time Machine Backup". But now that option isn't present.
