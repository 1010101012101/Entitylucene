Keyboard, notification, or menubar shortcut to compose mail message? <body> Im looking for a quick way to bring up a compose mail message dialogue.  Either a keyboard shortcut, or even a little tool within mountain lion's new notification center would be cool.  Anyone got anything?  <answer58656> The easiest way out-of-the box is to use the "services menu". Just select some text anywhere (a single character will do), right click to open the context menu and select the bottom-most item "Email Selection":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F3FZk.png" alt="Screenshot of Email Selection"  If it is not present (should be) you need to enable it under System settings - Keyboard - Keyboard commands - Services - Text  <answer58661> One option would be to assign a shortcut to an AppleScript like this:  precodetell application "Mail"     make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true}     activate end tell /code/pre  <answer83612> Mail Unread Menu is what you want. Free/donation-ware. Compose New Mail from the menubar.   Also custom alerts and more. Working well in Mountain Lion.  <comment67743> Could I suggest some external software? <comment67842> @qegal go for it
