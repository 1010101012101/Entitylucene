When using Numbers app, is there a setting to create a new column when user presses tab? <body> When you are navigating in Numbers, pressing the kbdtab/kbd key will take you to the emnext cell to the right/em and allows you to start typing. Very quick and helpful for data entry. When the user reaches the last column, pressing tab has strongno effect/strong. In MS Excel, pressing tab in the final column will strongcreate a new column/strong and allow the user to continue.  Is it possible to do the same in numbers or is there always a break in workflow to stop and create new columns manually? Same question applies for enter but for rows. In excel, pressing enter in the final row will add a new row and let the user continue.  <answer275632> To add a row above the selected cells use the Option+Up Arrow command.
