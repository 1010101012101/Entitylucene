How do I change my display settings if I can't see my screen? <body> I have a macbook in clamshell mode that's plugged into an HDTV for display output.  Yesterday, I changed my display settings via the System Preferences.  However, I inadvertently picked a setting that is not supported by my screen, and now I can't figure out how to undo the change.  The screen is blank.  I can open my laptop and go to dual-screen mode and change the settings there, but as soon as I switch back to clamshell mode the system picks the broken display settings again.  <answer7742> Try to to go code/Library/Preferences//code and search for codecom.apple.windowserver.plist/code. It's the file that gets updated when you modify the display in codeSystem Preferences/code (I just tried).  According to strongthis Apple KB/strong, it's safe to delete it. So move it on your desktop and try to reboot.  <answer7747> From the command line, cscreen lets you adjust monitor resolution.  <comment8377> Interesting point, to get the system to re-generate on re-boot.  I found 'some' display setting values on in a com.apple.preference.displays2.XXXXXXXX plist file in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost. NB: I do have 2 monitors, hence the "display2"? <comment8378> @petert Now that I checked on my Mac, I updated the post with the correct information.
