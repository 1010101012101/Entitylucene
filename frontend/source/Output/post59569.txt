Show progress indicators in Mail 6 (Mountain Lion) <body> Apple seems to have taken the brilliant decision of not showing progress indicators when you are checking for new emails. This is annoying, as you get 0 feedback when you press the "Get new messages" button.  Is there any way of getting Mail to still show the "checking for email" progress indicators?  <answer59583> I also found this problem pretty disturbing.  I didn't find a solution to bring the indicator back yet, but for having some kind of feedback I am using the activity window:  You can find it in the menubar: Windows -- Activity or you can press kbdcmd/kbd + kbdalt/kbd + kbd0/kbd  <answer73521> Click the arrow at the bottom of the sidebar in the main window to show the 'Mail Activity" indicators.  <comment85405> This does not show "checking for email" activities.
