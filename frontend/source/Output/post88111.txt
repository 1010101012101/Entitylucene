OS X Server: Wiki embed youtube video on page <body> On OS X server using the wiki feature, I want to embed a youtube.com video onto a page. I thought the process would be to switch to HTML coding when making the Wiki Entry and cut and paste the HTML embedded like tag of youtube video into the post along with all the other content.   precode&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mylinkaddress" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; /code/pre  When I save the page, it doesnt show up.... which makes sense since when I go back to edit the page and view the HTML, the  tag is no longer there. It seems like OS X server is rejecting the tag as invalid when saving the page.   How can I get OS X server to support embedding video into pages?  This occurs on the blog and wiki.   Update:  this is the Wiki Server  <answer88123> I had the same problem.  On the Server load terminal.app in your Utilities folder, and type in:  On Mountain Lion:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Server/Wiki/Config/collabd.plist FiltersEnabled false /code/pre  On Lion:  precodesudo defaults write /etc/collabd/collabd.plist FiltersEnabled false /code/pre  You may need to turn the Wiki Service off and on afterward for the settings to take affect. You can do this by typing:  precodesudo serveradmin stop wiki /code/pre  then  precodesudo serveradmin start wiki /code/pre  in the Terminal.  <answer88171> After trying this solution and editing the following file  precode/Library/Application Support/Apple/WikiServer/whitelist.plist /code/pre  I then realized that I needed to add the  tag from this article... duh  What I added was this the following XML to it:  precode        &lt;key&gt;iframe&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;frameborder&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;title&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;width&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;height&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;src&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;allowfullscreen&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  The wiki server then needs to be cycled   precodesudo serveradmin stop teams sudo serveradmin start teams /code/pre  Here is the full plist configuration  <comment103195> Neither of those paths exist on Mountain Lion Looks like the path is /Library/Application Support/Apple/WikiServer but that didn't work either with this fix: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3147233?start=0&tstart=0 <comment103217> What version are you using? (e.g. 10.8.3)
