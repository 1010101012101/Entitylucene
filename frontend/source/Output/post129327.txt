Avoiding all apps reopening when OS X crashes <body> Sometimes my computer will crash and restart due to unknown errors. It usually happens when I'm working on something so a few apps are open. OS X has this annoying feature where it tries to reopen all apps when you restart. You can disable it when manually restarting, but it still does it if the computer restarts after a crash.  I think this feature was built to save time, but all it does is waste more time than it's worth, because whenever the computer restarts from a crash I usually just restart it once more (this time with "Reopen apps" disabled) just to get to a workable state. The problem is it'll keep spawning apps and preventing the restart from happening.  Disabling this feature would prevent me having to restart after a crash altogether. Is there a way to stop OS X from doing this?  <answer129847> Try holding down kbdShift/kbd when you see the login window and release it when the Dock appears.  This prevents items in your login items from starting when you log in but doesn't prevent apps that are resumed.  <comment152105> Do you actually want us to help you getting rid of the errors ?
