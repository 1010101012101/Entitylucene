using multiple emails in the mail app and sending texts to that app as well <body> the question is almost identical to the title: i just got an iPhone 5, coming over from a blackberry. on my blackberry i was able to receive all my text messages and emails from both of my accounts (one personal gmail, and one work email address) in one app. is there a way to do this on the iPhone?  <answer72810> No. All SMS, MMS and iMessages are all collected in Messages.app. All email is, by default, put in Mail.app. There isn't any built-in way to merge the two.   That being said, there is some flexibility to view emmultiple inboxes/em in Mail.app. While in Mail.app, go back to codeMailboxes/code screen and select codeAll Inboxes/code. You will see all the email messages from all of your accounts in a unified view.
