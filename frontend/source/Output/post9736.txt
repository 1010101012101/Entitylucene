Apple shipping - air or sea? <body> Hope this isn't off topic too much, but I have just ordered a new Macbook Pro and it's in process of being shipped from Shanghai to my rural address in western Canada (I'm tracking it on UPS's site). This caused a heated discussion with my son about shipping computers. My position is that Apple will ship ALL their computers, custom built or not, from their Asian factories only by air, as they are too valuable to waste weeks shipping by, er, ships. Apple's website doesn't offer any help here, as they only talk about reducing packaging size to reduce the shipping costs.  Does anyone have any further information?   <answer9755> Apple's environment page alludes to their use of boats, but custom orders do indeed come by air.     For example, the packaging for the MacBook is 53 percent smaller than for the first-generation MacBook. That means 80 percent more MacBook boxes fit on each shipping pallet, strongmore pallets fit on each boat and plane, and fewer boats and planes are used./strong (Source)   <comment10194> What's the shipping estimate/tracking say? That would give you a clue as to the method used. My guess is air. <comment10196> Are you sure it's being shipped from Shanghai? I would imagine that Apple must have at least *one* distribution point in Canada, somewhere. They will probably ship it from there. <comment10198> Voting to close. This really isn't relevant to the scope of the site and there is no conclusive way to answer it. <comment47739> Since each package can be tracked these days, it seems unlikely that the general case matters to someone who has a specific package they can track. <comment62943> Trivia: contrary to FakeName's comment, my experience has also been that MacBooks ship to Western Canada from Shanghai.
