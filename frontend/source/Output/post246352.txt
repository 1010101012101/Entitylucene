LG Monitor not working with MiniDP input when Macbook Pro is in clamshell mode <body> After three days I'm throwing in the towel on this one.  Have an LG 27MB85R-B Monitor. Macbook Pro circa 2013. I first used an HDMI cable which worked fine, but I kept getting the Change Resolution message, plus the monitor has a MiniDP input, so I ordered a MiniDP-MiniDP cable. The color is beautiful and the resolution crisp and clear.   Here's the problem. When I use the MiniDP - HDMI cable, the monitor works when I put the Mac in clamshell mode. With the straight MiniDP-MiniDP cable, it shuts the monitor off due to lack of signal. The macbook stays on though, just like it is supposed to.   I've reset the monitor, restarted with cables out, cables in, did the CTRL+Option+P+R thing, even sacrificed a turnip to the cable deities, but nothing works. Might just be me wanting to have my cake and eat it too, but I have this great monitor and Twelve-South Mac holder, but cannot get everything to gel together in wonderful harmony.   Any advice would be welcome. I've looked all over everywhere and tried everything that everyone mentioned, but no go so fo yo yo.  Thanks so much.  W.
