AppleCare Status On My Mac: Ways to Check? <body> I am aware that one can check the AppleCare Status of their Mac by going to Apple Support.  What other ways exist (that maybe inbuilt within OS X) to clarify this, and possibly even schedule a repair ?  <answer96193> With Mountain Lion, it's possible to check from the machine itself. From the Apple Menu, select codeAbout this Mac/code, then codeMore Info.../code. On the next screen, select codeService/code and then codeCheck my service and support coverage status/code and you should find all the information you need.  The above was taken from The Mac Observer  <comment112919> This also works in Lion.
