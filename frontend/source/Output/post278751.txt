App Store download paused due to internet disconnection <body> I tried to download Xcode from the Mac app store and the internet connection stopped at some point. It has downloaded more that 3 GB out of 4.53 GB. Now that I got my internet connection back, but the download stopped entirely.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pLBXP.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried to open it, but it cannot be opened:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1iRPH.png" alt="enter image description here"  Should I go back to App Store and continue the download. But I am afraid that it will re-download the app. What should I do?  <answer279013> It'll automatically resume the progress of the download.
