Assign specific window to all desktops <body> How can I assign a specific window to show on all desktops? (Not the whole application, just one of its windows)  <comment356110> The Assign To option of a Dock Tile is on a per application basis, which includes all of its windows, not a per individual application window basis. <comment356113> Is there a 3rd-party tool that can do this? <comment356122> I couldn't find anything on Google. I have a few URLs that I want this for, but I'd also like a general solution I can apply to other applications.
