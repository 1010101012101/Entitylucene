Disable contact email's email from displaying in Messages <body> When I try and text from my Macbook, I open the Messages app, click the New Message button on the top left, and then begin to type the name of the person I want to text. I will quickly type the first few letters, the name pops up and is highlighted, then I hit [Enter] and begin to type my message. Unfortunately, if I have an email for that contact, it will show up as I find them and sometimes is highlighted. I will click their name without realizing it's for their email and not for their phone number. Thus, I send a special text-to-email from my service provider and it looks like spam on their end. I don't ever want to text to someone's email, which I used the Mail app for.  How can I prevent their emails from coming up in my Message app without removing their emails from their contact information? I am on Sierra 10.12.5
