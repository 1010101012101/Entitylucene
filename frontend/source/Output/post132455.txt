Constant message from GarageBand saying "Keyboard shortcuts changed" <body> GarageBand constantly fires off the following message when not the foreground app. It's extremely distracting. The messages appear in the Growl dropdown, and continues to cycle between these two messages:  1) strongKeyboard shortcuts changed/strong Australian is not supported - U.S. has been activated.   2) strongKeyboard shortcuts changed/strong U.S. has been activated   Notes:  ul liMacbook Pro /li liOS X 10.9.3/li liExternal Apple keyboard (Australian) and Apple magic mouse/li liGarageBand 10.0.2!/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jAyUd.png" alt="img1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZyMk.png" alt="img2"  <comment155806> that is a new one, so garage band does not support Australia keyboard layout ? <comment156887> It does seem that way!
