App Store download/installation status? <body> Does the AppStore not provide download / installation status?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P3it9.png" alt="enter image description here"  I clicked on get app, and all I see is "installing". No status, no feedback, nothing. Is this normal? I know Xcode is a big download, so I know it will take a while, but feedback would be nice.  <answer202286> From Check Download Progress on the Mac App Store:     strongHow to See Download Progress of Apps Coming from the Mac App Store/strong      Want a general idea of an app downloads progress? Here’s what to do:      ul   liFrom the Mac App Store, click on the “Purchases” tab to see the active list/li   liLocate the app(s) you are downloading that you want to check/li   /ul   Also if strongLaunchpad/strong is in your strongDock/strong it typically shows some information too.  <comment243986> Thanks. Would never think to look for it there. <comment243987> Yeah, I don't use launchpad.
