How to be sure my Mac is fully disconnected? <body> On many occasion thinking that my Mac was disconnected from any form of network (with or without wire), I discovered that in fact it was confortably chating at full speed with the rest of the world through a forgotten connection. Typically:  precodetcpdump -i en1 /code/pre  displayed a high speed movie about codedomain/code, codebootpc/code, codehttp/code, codenetbios/code, codehttps/code, code5223 (unassigned)/codeâ€¦ trafics.  For the wireless side, there is a nice function to be aware that a Mac is connected or not: the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar.  But for infrared, Bluetooth, Ethernet, MacOS X seems to miss the same usefull and simple function.  hr  Is there a strongtrustable/strong software or method to be sure that a Mac if strongfully/strong disconnected from strongany/strong form of network?  I would be mostly interested by something as small and as visual as the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar.  <answer175478> This software should accomplish what you're looking for: "Ethernet Status" There might be free alternatives, this is the first one I came across.
