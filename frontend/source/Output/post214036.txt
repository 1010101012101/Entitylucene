Mail Mac automatically creates a link, even if I remove it manually <body> When composing an email using Mail Mac (OS X El Capitan), if I write emsomething .cc/em, an hyperlink is automatically created. Since I do not want this, I manually remove the link. Anyway, when the email is sent, in the inbox folder the link appears again. Is there a way to prevent Mail to automatically add the link after I remove it?  <answer214129> h3You can disable smart links and use codeCmd+K/code instead when you want to add link manually./h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YwLkV.png" alt="enter image description here"   <comment258480> I have _smart links_ option disabled and, when I write the email, no links seem to be present (no blue underscores). However, after sending it, links automatically appear again. <comment258487> oh, that is only while you view in apple mail (in sent items). try sending it to e.g. gmail address, you wont see the hyperlinks there. <comment258488> you right, thanks!
