Can't install new Seagate HD on mac -- greyed partion option under disk utilites <body> On my mac, trying to set up new Seagate Expansion Portable Drive. I get to the Disk utility, but the partition option is greyed out.   <answer265527> In all likelihood, the drive is formatted as NTFS - Window’s proprietary filesystem - which operates as emread only/em in OS X. In order to partition the drive, or even use it, you need to reformat it first.   ul liOpen Disk Utility. Select the hard drive from the sidebar. Click “Erase”/li liChoose a name for the volume. You must also choose a format and scheme. The default OS X configuration is HFS+ Journaled with a GUID partition map.
