Safari only wants to connect to localhost via HTTPS <body> Do a lot of local development and recently I've noticed that I cannot connect to non-HTTPS services running on localhost. If the services provide HTTPS then I am able to connect, but every time I try something like "http://devsite:8000", Safari always tries to access "https://devsite.local:8000".  Using Chrome, I can properly access the site.  Perhaps the issue is HSTS?  I am running Safari 10.1 on macOS Sierra.  <answer283673> Actually, it looks like it was HSTS.  I followed the directions posted here:  ol liClose Safari./li liDelete the ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist file./li liReopen Safari./li /ol  And now localhost sites are working correctly.
