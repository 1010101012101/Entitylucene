Removing built-in git from El Capitan <body> I installed latest version of codegit/code into code/usr/local/bin/code and change code$PATH/code so that new version is picked up when using shell. Can I remove old version that is in code/usr/bin/code directory ? I am afraid to do it because something could break in the system maybe. I am just curious about this.  <answer244489> There is a good answer over on Stack Overflow:  How to upgrade Git to latest version on Mac OS X?  Basically, you want to use brew to install and manage your (separate) git installation and leave the one provided by Apple alone.  You will obviously have to have Home Brew installed initially.  To install:  precodebrew install git /code/pre  To update:  precodebrew upgrade git /code/pre  <comment301318> The short answer is NO. Do not remove `git` from `/usr/bin`. If you did then you are now responsible for maintaining the system. At any point a software update could re-install the file. Adjust your PATH and leave it alone. <comment301346> This might also help you with shuting down your mac http://askubuntu.com/questions/578144/why-doesnt-running-sudo-shutdown-now-shutdown
