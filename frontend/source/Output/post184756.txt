Any ideas why Mavericks is slowing down due to BetterSnapTool? <body> I use BetterSnapTool to resize my windows with keyboard shortcuts. Since upgrading to Mavericks, after I've used my computer for 6-12ish hours, scrolling and moving things around the screen using the trackpad becomes sluggish and stutters. When I close BetterSnapTool, it fixes the issue, and it stays fixed until I relaunch.  Any ideas what is causing the issue? Is there an easy, low overhead way to automatically quit and relaunch BetterSnapTool every 4 hours or so?  <answer184761> (This answers the second question about how to automate restarting BetterSnapTool. Since I haven't experienced the issue described and have no second-hand explanations, I can't answer the question of emwhy/em this is happening.)  Here is a quick and simple AppleScript I whipped up that works for restarting BetterSnapTools:  precodetell application "BetterSnapTool" quit end tell  delay 2 -- Wait for BetterSnapTool to close  tell application "BetterSnapTool" to activate /code/pre  If you want to set this to automatically run every, say, 6 hours I think your best bet is to create a Launch Daemon using codelaunchd/code. A quick presentation of this approach can be found here. For more information, check the entry on creating Launch Daemons in the apple developer's library.  You said "low overhead", which I took to mean using only methods native to OS X. If you're fine with third-party software, though, this GUI application for codecron/code (the precursor to codelaunchd/code) scheduling seems promising (but I haven't tried it so can't be certain).  <comment228427> My personal resolution: I switched to Spectacle, as explained here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x/66936#66936
