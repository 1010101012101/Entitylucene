Brew installed Boost different versions <body> I am currently trying to work out how to handle different versions of libraries installed via Homebrew on OS X. In particular Boost.  I did have codeboost/code installed (currently v159) and codeboost155/code, but could not work out how to switch between versions 155 and 159 so I installed codeboost159/code.  After a bit more exploration into the matter I'm guessing it's all down to codelink/code and codeunlink/code so it does seem little different to having:  codeboost155/code and codeboost159/code installedbr vsbr codeboost155/code and codeboost/code installed    (Except the latter might update to later versions of Boost as they become available.)  Then what I assume is the way:  precodebrew unlink boost159 brew link --force boost155 /code/pre  To switch from 159 to 155 and vice versa.  Alternatively if I have boost installed (rather than boost159):  precodebrew unlink boost brew link --force boost155 /code/pre  Basically my question is how best to manage these different versions of boost? Is what I say above about link/unlink correct, and is either way preferable?
