How to connect my macbook to a Wi-Fi network? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4V6M.png" alt="There&#39;s network"  Using inSSider I see the eduroam network. Yet Wi-Fi doesn't detect it yet. Why could it be?  <answer58580> It may be that the network doesn't broadcast it's SSID (tools like inSSider can pick up the name other ways). Try clicking strongJoin Other Network/strong and entering the details manually, see if that works.  <comment67437> Didn't work either. It's a broadcasting network. Other macbooks find it. <comment67440> How do you know WiFi doesn't detect it? <comment67443> the Wi-Fi window reads no network selected (and also from Join other network...).
