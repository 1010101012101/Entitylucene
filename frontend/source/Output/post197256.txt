How can I show text labels on buttons globally? <body> How do I display text in addition to icons in toolbar buttons?  For example, I find some of the icons in the Preview app to be quite unintuitive.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7ZVD.png" alt="Screenshot of Preview"  Is there a way to set this globally across all apps?  <answer197257> I have not yet found a way to set this globally across all apps.  For the Preview app, you can right-click on the toolbar button or kbdcontrol/kbd-click, and then select "Icon and text" to get this result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3Rsz.png" alt="Screenshot of Preview with icons that have text labels"  <comment235823> I believe you are correct. This is an app preference and not something that you can globally set for all apps.
