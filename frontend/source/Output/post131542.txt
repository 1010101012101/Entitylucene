Prevent Mac(bookpro) form sleeping while iPhone charges <body> I charge my iPhone by plugging it in my MBP. Until recently, if I closed my MBP when my iPhone was already connected, my phone kept charging. If you plugged it in when my MBP was already in sleepmode, it didn't charge.   Recently I noticed this no longer works. If my MBP goes to sleep, charging stops. Is there a way this can be turned back on?
