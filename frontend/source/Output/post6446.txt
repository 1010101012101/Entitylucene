How to set a Monospace Font for Dashboard Sticky Notes Widget? <body> I would like to use a monospaced font on the Sticky Notes in Apple's Dashboard widget. However, only a few fonts can be selected, none of which is monospaced.  <answer6451> This is possible, because widgets are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based. Here's how:  First, stronggo to/strong code/Library/Widgets/code and find the Stickies one. Copy it to code~/Library/Widgets/code and name it codemyStickies/code (or something else). brstrongClose/strong the Stickies widget in Dashboard. brNow, stronggo to/strong the codemyStickies.wdgt/code version you copied and strongright-click/strong it. Choose codeShow Package Contents/code. brIn the new window that appears, strongright-click/strong on the codeStickies.js/code file and strongopen/strong it with your favorite JavaScript editor (if you don't have one, TextWrangler is great and free). brNow, use the editor to strongfind/strong the line codevar fontArray = new Array;/code (should be around line 407). You'll see below that line a bunch of lines similar to each other, saying something like brcodefontArray["font name"] = 1,/code. You want to strongcopy/strong the last one of those (American Typewriter), and strongpaste/strong it back below itself. Then, strongchange/strong it so it looks like this: codefontArray["Courier New"] = 8;/code brstrongSave/strong and strongclose/strong this file. brNow, strongopen/strong (from the same folder) codeStickies.html/code in an HTML editor (TextWrangler works). brstrongFind/strong the line that says, brcode&lt;select id='font-popup' class='popup' onchange='fontchanged(this);'&gt;/code (should be about line 40). brBelow that, you'll strongfind/strong a bunch of lines similar to each other, each beginning with code&lt;option value/code. strongCopy/strong the one for Gill Sans, and strongpaste/strong it below itself.br strongEdit/strong it to say code&lt;option value ="Courier New"&gt;Courier New&lt;/option&gt;/code. brstrongSave/strong and strongclose/strong this file. brstrongOpen/strong Terminal and strongtype/strong codekillall Dock/code. This restarts Dashboard. brNow, strongdouble click/strong the myStickies widget file you made. It will open in Dashboard. strongFollow the normal procedure/strong of clicking the codei/code and changing the font. You'll have a Courier option, and it will be that font. brYay!
