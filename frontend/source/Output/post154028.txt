Annotation in Preview under Yosemite: How to get back the old behaviour? <body> I am using Yosemite (OS X 10.10) on my MacBook Air mid 2011.   In the version 10.9 and before, annotation (making strokes or arrows) worked liked this:  ol liSelecting the form you want to draw/li liSelect the colour you want to use/li liAND THEN you can draw it by hand/li /ol  The new behaviour is:  ol liChoose the form you want to draw/li liAnd then, it's immediately there. /li /ol  You have to move the form to the exact position and have no chance to draw it like in 10.9.     Is this a bug or where can i go back to the old behaviour?   <comment310952> Did you ever figure this out? This is super annoying. <comment310980> No, not yet. I guess this is the new behaviour now...
