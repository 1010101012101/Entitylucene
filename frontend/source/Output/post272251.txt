Getting my iPhone 6 to trust a computer after selecting Don't Trust <body> I accidentally hit "Don't Trust" on my iPhone and now my MacBook won't unlock my phone. Is there a way to reverse this?  <answer272254> Go to Settings → General → Reset → Reset Location &amp; Privacy.  This will reset your trusted computers (along with all your other privacy settings), and next time you connect the device a computer, it will prompt you to trust it. The privacy settings this will reset are all the settings under Settings → Privacy.  <comment342242> Can you elaborate on what else will be reset? "All your other privacy settings" = what specifically? <comment342244> @owlswipe All your privacy settings is everything within Settings → Privacy. They will be reset to their default settings.
