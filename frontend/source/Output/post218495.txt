cannot turn off spotlight indexing on external drive <body> I know this question has been asked before, but the solutions suggested are not working for me.  I just finished attaching a brand new external hard-drive and waiting for 14 hours for Time Machine to finish backing it up. Now, I cannot eject the drive. I get this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1K11Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't want to "Force Eject..." because the last time I did that it destroyed the file system in a fashion that it could not be repaired. Thus the need for new external hard drive.  It seems like Spotlight indexing is the culprit here:  precode$sudo lsof | grep /Volumes/Backup/ mds          64           root   21r      DIR                1,7       2108  3347098 /Volumes/Backup/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V2/26061632-2165-4372-BACA-B77080B37A25 mds          64           root   24u      REG                1,7          0  3347143 /Volumes/Backup/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V2/26061632-2165-4372-BACA-B77080B37A25/journalExclusion mds_store   310           root  txt       REG                1,7          8  3347107  /code/pre  I have tried adding my Backup drive to the Spotlight privacy list.

I am running OS X 10.11.1 on a Macbook Pro (Mid-2010).br The external drive is:br Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2TB Portable External Hard Drive with Mobile Device Backup USB 3.0  Solution:br I was a little nervous about killing the spotlight process because I wasn't sure if it would cleanly close the files it had opened before shutting down. I didn't want to corrupt my file system again.  Directly killing the processes did not work. They just came back to life again with new process ids.  However, using launchctl did work. I was able to eject the drive. And it looks like my file system did not get corrupted.  precode$sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist $ps -ax | awk '/[m]ds/{print $1}' $sudo lsof | grep /Volumes/Backup/ /code/pre  <answer218496> Have you tried disabling spotlight on the device per terminal command?  Something like codesudo mdutil -i off -d -E &lt;mountpoint&gt;/code to disable indexing, searches and to erase spotlight caches on the drive.   According to your output code/Volumes/Backup/code has it disabled but code/Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/code hasn't, it may make a difference to run the command with that mountpoint.  hr  Another solution suggested here is to stop the spotlight process entirely. You could do this with codekill &lt;procid&gt;/code or launchctl. You can re-start it after ejecting the drive.  (The procid for the kill command is the one in the second column of your lsof results, or you can alternatively use use codeps -ax | awk '/[m]ds/{print $1}'/code to get the procids for mds and mds_store.)  <comment264145> tried both of these suggestions. added the results above. <comment264147> This worked: sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist <comment264148> Great to hear @AlexRyan! <comment264153> By the way, you can take screenshots of individual windows by pressing Command-Shift-4, pressing the spacebar, and clicking on the window that you want to take a screenshot of. It's faster and looks much cleaner than the other way.
