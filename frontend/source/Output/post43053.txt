How do I clear the Diagnostics & Usage data from my iPhone? <body> Settings  General  About  Diagnostics &amp; Usage  Diagnostic &amp; Usage Data  I've elected not to send this data to Apple, so is there a way to clear or delete it?  <answer43054> They are usually deleted when you do a sync.  <answer95120> Open iFile. Go to var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter and delete all files leaving the 3 folders undeleted. Done.  <answer221856> In iPhone 5s iOS 9.2 go to Settings-Privacy and go the last part of the menu -Diagnostic &amp; Usage. Then select which one you want.  <answer226660> Make sure your iPhones is backed up ! Then then General , master reset that clears everything and reset your iPhone back to its original setting, then start your iPhone just like it was a new one ! Once it's has the wifi set up all your information goes back on your iPhone but not the diagnosis &amp; usage ! I have to do this about once every few months to keep my iPhone 6plus s running fast , this works the fastest for me and all you need to have is a Wifi connection ! Time it takes me is 6 to 15 minutes max , your reset may take less or more time depending on the information that you have stored on iCloud !   <comment48976> yep, that cleared it. thanks <comment257564> It's not clearing for me, similar to this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/199393/ios-9-public-beta-diagnostic-usage-data-not-being-cleared
