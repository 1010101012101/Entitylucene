Reloading altered keyboard layout <body> Can I get an altered keyboard layout in code~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/code to be reloaded without rebooting?  <comment256587> Are you talking about a Ukelele layout?  Do you have to reboot every time you want to use it?  Normally all you have to do is logout/login when you first install it. <comment256604> @TomGewecke, Yes. If I add one with a new name it is available right away, but if I overwrite an old, it only reloads after a reboot. <comment256622> I doubt you can avoid that.  Ask on the group devoted to Ukelele.  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ukelele-users
