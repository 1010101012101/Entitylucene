Create Mavericks bootable USB under Windows for MacBook Air <body> After experiments with my macbook air, I have clean hdd drive without any OS on it completely (nor recovery partitions). How can I create bootable usb flash drive to install mavericks back to my macbook on Windows pc? Unfortunately I have no any other mac, nor my colleagues.   <comment169591> Also if there more quick or easier way to install Lion or Snow Leapard - thats OK, then I'll just upgrade through MacAppStore <comment169614> Internet Recovery? <comment169621> @thankyour guess it'll be faster rather than create virtual machine and make boot usb stick here. Still I believe there's more options to do this
