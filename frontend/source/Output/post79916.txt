Network folder sync tool with intuitive subfolder selection? <body> I have 100GB+ of data (photos, music etc) on a network share, but due to the small disk size (128GB SSD) on my Macbook Pro, I'd like to have a local copy of a small selection of it, and easily manage what data is locally synced.  I'm struggling to find a good solution for this. I'm after the following features:  ul listrongLAN sync/strong. I want transfers between my computers on the same network to be fast, not via cloud storage - nor do I want to plug in a USB drive every time I want to sync stuff. /li listrongAffordable/strong. Although I have 100GB+ of data, I don't need it in the cloud, so don't really want to pay the cloud storage rates. I'm willing to consider cloud-based options if they're affordable and offer LAN sync, though./li listrongSync any folder/strong. I don't want sync to be limited to syncing only contents of a particular folder. /li listrongSyncs automatically/strong or runs on an easily configurable schedule./li liIntuitive strongSelective Sync GUI/strong for managing subfolders to sync to the laptop. Dropbox's 'selective sync' feature is a good example, especially the "advanced view":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5x3Mv.jpg" alt="Dropbox OS X selective sync advanced view"/li /ul  I've looked at a number of options that are out there, but they all seem to fall short:  ul listrongGoodsync/strong. So close! Standalone app, Under $70 one-time payment (licences for mac &amp; the PC with the share). It just doesn't have the emIntuitive GUI for selecting subfolders to sync/em. To include/exclude folders to sync, you have to type/paste individual folder names into a list, rather than select them from a finder-like directory browser - this is tiresome and error-prone./li listrongChronosync/strong - another standalone app, similar to Goodsync - again no good selective sync GUI./li listrongDropbox/strong - has LAN sync &amp; selective sync, but only for files that it also hosts in the cloud; $100/year for 100GB is too much given that I don't need cloud storage. Only syncs ~/Dropbox./li listrongSkyDrive/strong - pricing reasonable ($50 for 100GB), but no LAN sync and can only syncs the ~/SkyDrive folder./li listrongSugarSync/strong - will sync any folder, but more expensive than Dropbox and no LAN sync./li /ul  Does anyone know any software that's a better match for my needs? Or perhaps I've missed existing useful features in these tools, or a completely alternate approach? Does anyone else have similar requirements?  I used to use unison to do this kind of thing but I got fed up with it because I didn't particularly have the patience to maintain profiles describing what I didn't want to sync etc.  <comment92200> If your MacBook Pro has space for a second drive, I'd ditch your optical and get a big spinning drive and make a DIY fusion drive. The OS will then tier data for you - but it's a pretty radical departure from a decently worded query so I'll not even suggest it as an answer. <comment146618> It is very hard to find a program that solves it all. I suggest you trying TeamDrive out. It looks like you could run it over the LAN. I found Syncplicity which lets you sync any folder in your system, and let's you exclude whatever subfolder you want, but you can't host it yourself, and it's 2 gb only.
