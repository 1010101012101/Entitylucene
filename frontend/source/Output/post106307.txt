SVG in Keynote? <body> I want to use line art in my Keynote presentations.  SVG is the Scalable Vector Graphics format, used natively by Inkscape.   Is there any way to use an SVG in Keynote, or do I need to convert to a PDF?  <answer190313> As of Keynote version 7.2 SVG is not supported without conversion using a third party app. (Would be nice though!)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ByQfz.png" alt="SVG import to Keynote"
