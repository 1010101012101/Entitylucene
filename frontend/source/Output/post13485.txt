A very good iPhone 4 Battery Extender <body> I'm a heavy user of an iPhone 4 and often got to the red line. I bought a Battery Extender a few months back, can't remember the company's name, but it stopped working suddenly after a month. What do you guys recommend?  <answer13487> According to customer reviews and bestseller ranking the Mophie Juice Pack Plus Case and Rechargeable Pack shouldn't be that bad.  <comment14354> +1 I did a lot of research when I was about to buy a battery extender and ended up going with Mophie.  It works great!
