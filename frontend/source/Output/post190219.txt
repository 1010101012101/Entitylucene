Monitor wallpaper becomes the same as laptop's when reconnected <body> Got an annoying problem I'd love some help with. For starters, I have a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9.5  When I plug in my external monitor at work, I like to have one wallpaper as my laptop background, and a different wallpaper as my monitor's background. I have no problem with using the "Desktop &amp; Screen Saver" option in System Preferences to do this.  But when I turn my laptop off and take it home at the end of the day, when I come back to work the next day and plug in my external monitor, the monitor's background won't be the wallpaper I set yesterday - it will become the same as the laptop background. The different wallpaper I set the day before is lost and I have to select it again.  Does anyone know how to avoid this? If you need any more information from me, let me know. Thanks in advance :)
