iPhone 5s has no iCloud Library option in Music Settings <body> I have an iPhone 5s. Unfortunately, no iCloud Library is an option in my Music Settings. "Music" does not show up in my iCloud Settings either. This is now affecting my new Mac as I am trying to sync all my iTunes music and many songs are missing.
