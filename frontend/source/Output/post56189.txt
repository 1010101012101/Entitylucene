With WebDAV provided by Microsoft SharePoint, how can users of OS X minimise risks of corruption and multiuser overwrites? <body> There are various OS X approaches to using the strongWebDAV service provided by Microsoft SharePoint/strong.   h1Integrity of data/h1  Answers to this question focus on integrity:   ul liwhen a file is used by a single user/li liwhen a file is used by multiple users. /li /ul  Whilst some parts of an answer may be generalised to WebDAV servers in general, this question focuses on SharePoint – where strongMicrosoft's server and client restrictions/strong cause people to seek strongalternatives to Microsoft Document Connection/strong.   Some overlap with an earlier question:   ul liIs it possible to mount SharePoint as a volume in 10.6?/li /ul  h2Reference/h2  Drafted in May 2012 a table:   ul liFile open/lock protection for multi-user use of Microsoft SharePoint/li /ul  Key points from that draft:   ul lirestrictions in SharePoint make Microsoft Office 2011 incompatible with file system integration/li liMicrosoft Document Connection lacks file system integration./li /ul  If any reader can draw a conclusion that differs from what's tabled: I'll welcome discussion in Ask Different Chat, or add your answer below.   Some parts of that table will become answers to this question …  <answer56190> h1Use the web interface provided by SharePoint/h1  Tested with the following apps:   ul liLibreOffice /li liMicrosoft Excel/li liMicrosoft PowerPoint/li liMicrosoft Word/li liNeoOffice./li /ul  h2Pros/h2  For multiple users of SharePoint, protection through the web interface seems good.   h2Cons/h2  No file system integration.   <answer56192> h1Use Microsoft Document Connection/h1  Tested with the following apps:  ul liLibreOffice/li liMicrosoft Excel/li liMicrosoft PowerPoint/li liMicrosoft Word/li liNeoOffice./li /ul  h2Pros/h2  For multiple users of SharePoint, protection through Microsoft Document Connection seems good.  h2Cons/h2  No file system integration.

Open source.   Supported by Apple.   h2Cons/h2  Do not expect integration with Excel, PowerPoint or Word:  ul liMicrosoft SharePoint disallows some characters /li liMicrosoft Office 2011 requires codes that are deprecated, proper representations of which are disallowed by SharePoint. /li /ul  Do not expect all actions in Finder to work:   ul liMicrosoft's disallowance of characters prevents the integrity that is required by Finder./li /ul  hr  I could have tested with other apps. However: since the defaults of SharePoint make file system integration impossible with Microsoft Office – and since it's reasonable to assume that organisations pushing SharePoint will also push Microsoft Office – I decided to focus on other approaches.   h3Understanding the role of Finder/h3  To stronginitiate/strong this type of connection to a WebDAV server, there's an interface in Finder (the strongGo/strong menu). However, Finder is not the integrator; Finder is simply an app.   File system integration is around the following bundle, open source for which is provided by Apple:   code/System/Library/Filesystems/webdav.fs/code
