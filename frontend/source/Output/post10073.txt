Is there any decent Wordpress blogging client for Mac? <body> On Windows I used to blog to Wordpress using Microsoft Word 2010 blog feature, but the Mac version is missing this feature.  I am looking for alternatives, preferably free ones. If you specify a commercial solution please include the price:  codename (x$)/code.  Please do not suggest generic text/html editors and submit different suggestions as separated answers.  <answer10076> You might consider Flock, a free, Firefox-based browser with many other features, including a built in blog editor. It's quite an unusual program, as you can also use it to manage your Facebook and Twitter accounts and feeds. It's worth a look.  <answer10091> Unfortunately, the best solutions (ecto and MarsEdit) are not free. There is one alternative, but I would rather promote Sorin's solution of using Flock. If you are a TextMate, you can also use the XMLRPC capabilities of its Blogging bundle to blog from there.  Just curious, what more does a standalone editor offer in comparison to the WordPress rich text editor? I blog in plain text/html, but I think I remember the WordPress rich text environment to be rather flexible, with great media support for instance, as long as you are using a browser like Firefox.  <answer12946> You have basically two choices, both payware:  h2Marsedit/h2  $39.95: "The best way to write, preview, and publish your blog."  and  h2Ecto/h2  $19.95: "ecto is a feature-rich desktop blogging editor for MacOSX"  Both programs offer trial versions.   <answer13015> You should also look at Blogo     Publish text, images, videos,   slideshows and more. With a simple,   intuitive interface and support for   Wordpress, Blogger, Typepad, Typo,   Drupal, Joomla, and Expression Engine,   Blogo is the best way to maintain your   blog and spread the word with Twitter,   Ping.fm and other supported services.   for $25. I have used it before, and it was pretty good. They have a trial period, so you can check them out.  <answer102062>    h3Byword/h3      emPublish to strongWordPress/strong, Tumblr, Blogger, Scriptogram blogs and Evernote notebooks directly from Byword.

Way cheaper than MarsEdit. It supports multiple platforms such as Wordpress, Medium, Tumblr, Blogger.... also supports Markdown if you are a fan.  <comment10511> I preferred using MarsEdit when my blogs were on MovableType (an old version at that), but now that they are on WordPress, I just use the built-in WP editor. <comment13581> Thanks, but I'm not willing to drop Chrome :D <comment13597> I am a Mac User since Tiger and a casual blogger as well. I have Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro right now, and reason for having Windows is 1 software, it's call'ed Windows Live Writer. It's awesome if you are blogging. If Microsoft ports Windows Live Writer to Mac OS X in future, I'll remove Windows at that moment only ;) <comment13604> Also worth noting that Flock development has just been [discontinued](http://www.macworld.com/article/159186/2011/04/flock_discontinued.html), as of yesterday. <comment13808> Of course, Flock has been discontinued, unfortunately. I don't remember whether [RockMeIt](http://www.rockmelt.com/) does blogging, and their site is particularly unhelpful. <comment121600> If you want to add additional value to your answer, please include additional information about the application. Of special interest are features which make ths app standout from the rest.
