Finder window resizes by itself <body> Every time I restart the computer or just Finder app the Macintosh HD folder will be resized to the default size without remember my configuration. Why? Does someone know how to fix this?  <answer88113> I solved by copying a .DS_Store from another folder to Macintosh HD. I don't know why but Finder wasn't going to create it by itself.   <comment97093> Finder remembers the bounds even for the root folder for me, but does `/.DS_Store` exist or get modified? Have you tried deleting it or deleting other support files? <comment97432> @LauriRanta There isn't a .DS_Store in the folder. I think it has never been created.
