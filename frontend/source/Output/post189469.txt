Apple App Store (install and get) loop, how to fix it? <body> Apple App Store is stuck in a loop, when you press "get" you get "install", and when you press "install" you get "get" again, and so on with infinity loop, trying to download a free or commercial app â€” how do I make it stop?  <answer189470> I figured out that the problem came from fingerprint (Touch ID), as when I turned their options off, it worked like charm.  Just turn off those settings under "Touch ID &amp; Passcode" section: 1. iPhone Unlock. 2. iTunes &amp; App Store.  <answer230317> I had the same Install/Get loop problem. After lots of digging and resetting basically everything, I came upon my solution: it was the fake address I submitted when creating my Apple ID (literally just strings of random letters). I wasn't able to change it in the original ID, so I just made a new one where the zip code matched the state. That did the trick!  <answer234653> I just confirmed from Apple Support Center that it cannot install apps even free ones if there is not a credit card on file.   So, if not, add the credit info and shipping address to your apple id in advance.   <answer267657> I had this issue when using a test account from the Apple Developer program.  Once I changed back to my real account, I was able to install apps again.  To be clear, I'm talking about the Settings/iTunes &amp; App Store/Apple ID.  <answer283831> Press the button on the right side of phone to lock it. then log in using your passcode rather than your finger print.  Click install on the app you want and it will ask you for your finger print.    Press finger an you should be good to go.  Worked for me.  <comment286894> doesn't work for me
