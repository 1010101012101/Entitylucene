How to install java.pkg (not unarchiver) <body> When I try to launch MC it says I have to have the latest java (OSX Yosemite) this is the day after I updated.   So I download it, open the codedmg/code and then to find out that it is not a codejar/code launcher file (btw I know where it is located and how to use codejar/code launcher). It is a code.pkg/code that opens with the unarchiver.   I have read a previous post where it says that you need to launch it with codejar/code launcer... I tried that, but it was a fail.   It said it can't be opened with codejar/code launcher and then I get a console error message. So if anyone has a solution any help would be nice.  <answer169860> The Java installer is a package which installs using Installer. If the package doesn't open by default with Installer then right-click it and choose Open With â†’ Installer.
