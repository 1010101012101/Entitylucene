How do I remove Cisco Anyconnect from the Dock? <body> I am unable to remove Anyconnect from dock. It persists like Finder. On checking code~/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist/code I don't find Anyconnect listed in it. Is this setting stored somewhere else from where I can remove?  I am using Mavericks.  <answer115951> Typically you quit a program and then drag the dock icon out of the dock if it remains. The dragging needs to be a few inches outside the dock and pause until you see the cloud animation arrive around the icon before releasing the mouse.  <answer116104> Usual method of dragging and dropping app out of Dock works. I didn't realize that, the app was already running.  <comment135655> What shows when you right-click it? <comment135660> Do you want to remove Anyconnect completely? Or just from the Dock? Can you move Anyconnect within the Dock? Is Anyconnect still running? Background process or similar? <comment135661> Well I am an idiot, Didn't realize that anyconnect was running when I removed it. <comment135662> Feel free to write your answer as a proper answer rather than editing your question.
