Hooking into Active Screen (Hot) Corners <body> Anyone know if / how it is possible to launch a custom application via the  Active Screen Corners (aka Hot Corners) ?  <answer56043> I don't know any way to assign custom actions to screen corners without using third party applications, but one free application for that is CornerClick.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hTv9g.png" alt=""  <comment64689> It's open source: https://github.com/gschueler/CornerClick.git
