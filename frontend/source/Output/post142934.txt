Trouble with my partitions <body> I have some trouble with my partitions on my Macbook Pro. I created 2 partitions. One named "Yo" where I have installed Yosemite release. Another one named "Save" where I put all the stuffs I need to keep secure for work.  I want to create a 3rd one to re-install Mavericks just because one of my app is not working on Yosemite.  The trouble is that I can't do it through the Disk Utility GUI because everything is disabled. I saw a post here where they talked about using diskutil command in the terminal. I tried to follow it but I have something weird when I try to list all my disk. Here is the output:  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         224.9 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                  Apple_HFS Save                    24.5 GB    disk0s4    5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Yo                     *223.3 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  C5EE25C4-6BC6-4E56-961A-F43335118355                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  What I want to achieve is having these 3 partitions:  ul li"Yo" - 180GB/li li"Mavericks" - 45GB/li li"Save" - 25GB/li /ul  Is that achievable without having to reinstall Yosemite and if so how can I succeed to do that?  <answer142944> The problem is that the codeYo/code volume is inside a CoreStorage logical volume group. You can manipulate them from the command line, but the easiest thing to do is just revert it to a normal partition (in the terminal):  precodediskutil coreStorage revert /dev/disk1 /code/pre  This shouldn't cause data loss, but as always when working with partitions, back up anything you can't afford to lose. Once it's a normal partition, you should be able to manipulate it in Disk Utility again.  See codeman diskutil/code for more information.  <comment168419> Apart from the fact that the Yosemite installer seems to make a CoreStorage volume, this isn't really a question about Yosemite. CoreStorage has been around since Lion I think and this problem could arise in other situations. It should be simple enough to reword it without Yosemite references.
