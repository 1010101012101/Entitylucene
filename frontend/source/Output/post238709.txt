Can I hIde "Documents" from "Apple>Recent Items" menu? <body> I often use codeï£¿&gt;Recent Items/code to select recent applications and servers, but I emnever/em user it for recent documents. Is there a way to remove codeDocuments/code from this menu while retaining codeApplications/code and codeServers/code.  <comment292973> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/211471/recent-items-menus-have-stopped-working-on-my-imac has some ideas on what to look for if it breaks, but I can't see anywhere where you can set Docs/Apps/Servers to different values. The global parameter is in Prefs  General
