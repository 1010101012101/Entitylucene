Does OS X store my complete install history? <body> I'm running 10.6.8 and wondering where my Mac stores my install history -- I'm thinking everything from Ruby gems to full blown web apps. Does such a general file exist?  <answer30581> Look in /var/log for codeinstall.log/code and codeinstall.log.[something].bz2/code.  codeinstall.log/code contains the most current logs; the other files are archives of successively older log files, made whenever each one reached a maximum size.  <comment35053> Can you be more clear about what install history?  Is it an application install history or what? <comment35077> This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
