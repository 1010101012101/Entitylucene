Updating to iOS 8.1 from computer <body> I want to update my iPhone 5s which now has iOS 7.1 to iOS 8.1.  My question is: If I update it from iTunes is the 5.1 gb iOS 8 going to remain on my computer or it will be deleted after the update is done?  <answer164323> iOS software updates are stored in code~/Library/iTunes/code. If it remains there after the upgrade you can easily delete it yourself.  <comment192655> Also, iOS 8.1 is not 5.1GB in size. It's about 2GB.
