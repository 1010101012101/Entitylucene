Winterboard for macOS <body> Winterboard is an app/tweak for jailbroken iDevices which allows theming of GUI elements by non-destructively replacing files for application. For example, it could allow you to replace the SpringBoard icon for an application on standard @2x retina displays if you create your own codeAppIcon@2x.png/code and place it in a folder called the bundle identifier of the application you want to theme in code/Library/Themes//code. Unlike replacing codeAppIcon@2x.png/code itself, this has the advantage of staying across app updates as the actual files aren't modified.  Is there something like this for macOS? There is LiteIcon, but it does "destructively" replace the app icon. I put "destructively" in quotes because when the app icon of a macOS app is changed, it keeps the original icon and displays the new one (however, this is lost with updates). Sometimes I change the icon of an app or two, but they keep getting overwritten with app updates. A program like this would also be useful for theming assets found in the codeResources/code folder of applications, for example.  <comment364862> There's probably nothing available:  http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/el-capitan-end-mac-customization/ <comment364864> That's a good point, but that suggests the end of mainstream customization with system apps. You need to disable SIP to change system app icons. However, I think something like this is possible with third-party apps <comment364879> *but that suggests the end of mainstream customization with system apps.*  That's exactly what the article stated.  It also goes on to say that expecting the user to disable SIP for a $15 app is unreasonable. <comment364884> Okay, but what I'm looking for is something that will work with other apps. If it works with system apps when SIP is disabled, that's a bonus
