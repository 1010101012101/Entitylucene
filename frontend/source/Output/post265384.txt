Error 78 when starting opendirectoryd: Function not implemented <body> I'm trying to change the root password from single user mode on Yosemite (10.10.5). Here are the commands I'm using:  precode# mount -uw / # launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist # passwd root /code/pre  However, the output from that is as if opendirectoryd had not started:     passwd: The daemon encountered an error processing request. The daemon encountered an error processing request.   And in fact, it has not started. codeps ax/code shows that there is no opendirectoryd process running. codelaunchctl list/code lists the service, lists the PID as code-/code, and the error code as 78, which according to codelaunchctl error/code means "Function not implemented".  How can I fix this?
