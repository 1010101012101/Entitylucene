iCloud Photo Sharing <body> I have a Macbook Air and an iPhone 6 and iCloud Photo Sharing is turned on.  Both are giving me messages that there's no more room for photos. I have around 3,000 photos. I thought my photos were stored in iCloud and not on my devices.  How can I remove photos from my Mac and my phone without deleting them from my iCloud?  And how do I access my iCloud photos?    <answer282487> Kay -   strongAll of your photos, if you have iCloud Photo Library turned on, are automatically uploaded to iCloud./strong  All photos you upload to iCloud are available to be accessed online from the strongiCloud website/strong.
