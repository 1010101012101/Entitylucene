Adding text to PDF using Adobe Reader in OS X <body> As can be seen from the screenshot, I have selected "Add text at cursor" and entered the desired text.  But as can emalso/em be seen - there is only a tiny very narrow entry there - I can not even discern if emany/em text were actually being displayed.  Adding text should be a simple procedure. What am I missing here?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dClAG.png" alt="Adobe Reader Screenshot"   <answer170885> I guess we can assume that the document does not fillable fields (because if it had, the question would not have come up).  The "Add text at cursor" tool is a markup tool, used for correction text. It sets a marker in the text, and the text to add is contained in the popup.  The suitable Comment tool for this purpose ("filling" out a form) would be the Add Text Comment tool.
