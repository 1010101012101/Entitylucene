I have access to disk utility for example  Thanks  <comment217380> After 1 minute while using it or if you just leave it for 1min? <comment217381> Does he screen show anything or is it just completely grey? <comment217423> @KevinGrabher So lock screen was sown before show desktop <comment217424> your sentence doesn't make any sense - try again <comment217426> @KevinGrabher I just want to get access to download my iPhoto to flash USB drive, but my mac won't boot. I can access disk utility but how can I copy some folders (iPhoto folder with photos) to external drive, because I want reinstall mac. <comment217427> When reinstalling OS X your personal folders won't be deleted. If you want to format the drive either use disk utility to clone it or terminal to copy single folders <comment217428> @KevinGrabher Unfortunately can't reinstall, can you check please my last question here, unfortunately can't past link from app. Or maybe you also can send some links how to do it via terminal I mean to copy folders without osx
