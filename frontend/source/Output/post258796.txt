How do you get macOS Sierra (10.12.1) to lock and ask for a password after display sleep? <body> After upgrading to 10.12.1 my Mac no longer locks after display sleep. Before the update, a login prompt always appeared. This is either using:  ol liThe keyboard (⌘ ⌥ power)/li liTiming out (set for 10min)/li liClosing the clam shell./li /ol  <answer258797> You might want to check your settings under System Preference-General. There's a setting there for requiring password after sleep or after screen saver begins, might have changed? Hope it'll work for you.  <answer258798> So I figured it out a solution as soon as I could ask.  I toggled the Require Password settings to "Immediately" then back to my previous "5 seconds" and now all seems to be working properly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EkzTS.gif" alt="Changing required password time."  This required my password each time but well worth the re-enabled security. You may even be able to just uncheck then recheck the Required box. I can't test this because my issue is fixed.  <comment323585> Just curious, what app did you use to make the .gif image in your answer? <comment323586> [licecap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) <comment323600> So far two coworkers have had the same issue. One of them didn't notice the issue because he uses a screensaver which still honored his existing locking preferences. <comment323601> My solution fixed the above mentioned issue for two coworkers. <comment323913> This worked for me as well. Was curious if there is a way to do this via the command line? <comment324539> I had exact the same issue after upgrading to 10.12.1, but i can't change the "Require password xxx after sleep or screen saver begins" option because it is grey. i have typed my password and have access to change all settings except this one. It is so strange. <comment343057> I successfully used my solution again after upgrading to macOS Sierra **10.12.3**. But this shouldn't be happening.
