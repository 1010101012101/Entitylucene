where are python packages installed on Lion? <body> I'm pretty sure before Lion, I was using code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.7/site-packages/code  Although this might have been from a manual install of 2.7 on 10.6 OS X.    Anyway, any idea where standard location is for python packages that are installed?  <answer25654> precode/Library/Python/x.x/site-packages /code/pre  (x.x designates the version).  <answer25655> Found it! Python packages are installed in code/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/code by default.  <answer94489> Answers are correct for the default OSX install of Python.   If you have been mucking about trying different versions and changing paths you might be using a different one.   If you are struggling with not being able to import packages that you installed.   Try:  precodefrom distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib print(get_python_lib()) /code/pre  <comment29093> I'm not seeing the site-packages folder anymore in there though.. For instance, I have django installed, but can't find it's source files <comment29094> nevermind, figured it out (/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages)
