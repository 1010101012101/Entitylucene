View input from a Thunderbolt video card w/o lag fullscreen on iMac <body> strongMy hardware:/strong iMac 27" Late 2012, a Windows/Linux/Hackintosh/whatever OS PC, a Thunderbolt Capture card I'll be buying (such as emBlackMagic Intensity Shuttle Thunderbolt/em).  I'll be building a Gaming PC, and I already have an iMac 27 inch late 2012. Its video card will have one port (HDMI) connected to my TV as main display and another (DisplayPort with a DPHDMI adaptor) connected to the capture card as second display. Also, I'd like it to be 1080p  The capture card will have a Thunderbolt cable (output) attached to my iMac. What I'd like to do is to use the beautiful screen of my iMac as a display for my PC.  I'm mainly going to use this for video editing and web development, but a decent frame rate and strongno lag/strong are necessary because sometimes I might want to play some games with a keyboard and mouse.  Is this possible?  strongIf yes,/strong then what software will I have to run on my Mac to do this? Would emVLC/em be enough or I'd need to download/purchase something else? (it's okay even if it costs money).  strongIf no,/strong then how could I do this alternatively?  emNote: I'm not going to use Apple's "Target Display Mode" as it does only support Macs via Thunderbolt on my Mac model./em  Thanks in advance for help!
