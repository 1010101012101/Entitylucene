How to perform FileVault authenticated restart when updating OSX from AppStore? <body> I am aware of the authenticated restart when using FileVault 2 on OS X. Running the codefdesetup authrestart/code command does however restart the system immediately.  Now, when running the OS X Update from the App Store (which often requires restarting the system) the update process reboots the system automatically at "its own convenience". It prompts about the restart requirement before starting the whole update process and there is no "you should reboot now"-point in time.  Is there any way to "combine" OS X Update from the App Store with authenticated restart so that a remote system with system drive would not require manual drive unlocking from the console?  <comment317401> Good question - I have exactly the same one. Please come back here if you find anything out, as will I.
