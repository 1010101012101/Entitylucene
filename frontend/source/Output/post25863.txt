How do I save ftp.plist file when using sudo nano? <body> I edited ftp.plist by using sudo nano in terminal, and I saved by control + O but after reboot, it changed again. How can I save the file?  <answer25903> In Finder navigate to /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist  ol liFile  Get info kbdCommand/kbd + kbdi/kbd/li liTick the "Locked" box/li /ol  The file should not change now when you reboot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YKwSB.png" alt="Locked"  <comment29393> We are talking about /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist I assume. Did you verify whether your changes were written to the file after leaving nano? <comment29395> Do you not want the file to be modified once you edit it? <comment29399> It was written well. Because when I quit terminal and open the file again, it was changed. But after rebooting, it changed like before it is edited. <comment29489> I cannot see the file in the directory like this. http://imgur.com/CsgPm So I edited the file using Terminal. Is there any option for see all files? <comment29493> I solved this problem by changing built-in ftp server's port to 9221 in etc/services file.
