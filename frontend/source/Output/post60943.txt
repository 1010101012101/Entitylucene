How to type this tilde ~ in Mac (I can only type ˜ Using Fn + N) on an Italian Mac? <body> I've seen this answer, but on my Italian keyboard I've got kbd&lt;/kbd between kbdZ/kbd and kbdLeft Shift/kbd instead of the kbd~/kbd. So, how can I type it?   <answer60965> kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbd5/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtyVV.png" alt=""  You can show the keyboard viewer from the input menu if it's enabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8NArZ.png" alt=""  <answer117482> Using an Italian Keyboard.   The kbdoption/kbd + kbdN/kbd will Also give you a Small Tilde  code˜/code as apposed to code~/code  <answer117484> With the italian keyboard you can use  kbdalt/kbd + kbd5/kbd  <answer226893> It is left Alt + ^ which will give you tilda sign over Swedish Mac keyboard.  <answer258942> Alt Ñ on Spanish keyboard. Hope this works.  <answer264573> I have a Spanish keyboard. Alt+Ñ works just fine.It gives you this ~. If you press that combination, it gives you the tilde highlighted in yellow. This means that if you press a valid letter just after the tilde, it will place it over that letter. If it is not valid, it just leaves the tilde as it is and writes the letter you pressed. If you press space after the tilde, it will leave it as it is, like this ~. Hope this helped :)  <answer286117> I struggled a lot about writing accents and special characters in macOS with an Italian keyboard. The most comfortable way to do them is to hold kbdoption/kbd + press a key.  Specifically, for tilde, as mention above is kbdOption/kbd + kbd5/kbd (try other keys also, you'll be used to it in a while).  There are other special combinations for accents which are:  ul likbdoption/kbd + kbdN/kbd and a letter for ñ/li likbdoption/kbd + kbdU/kbd and a letter for ü/li likbdoption/kbd + kbd8/kbd and a letter for ú/li likbdoption/kbd + kbd9/kbd and a letter for ù/li likbdoption/kbd + kbdì/kbd and a letter for ô/li /ul  <answer290861> Correct combination on an italian keyboard is kbdalt/kbd+kbd5/kbd  In System Preferences/Keyboard/Input Soruces, press kbdalt/kbd and it will show what each key does.  <comment70242> Is there anything wrong with fn + n? <comment70243> @Gerry it's not the same tilde <comment70244> try option and 5 <comment70245> Despite a keyboard combination, if you don't want to use it by its own, you could still use the **Character picker**. Just press and hold the **N**, for instance, and a pop-Up will show, giving you the option of choosing the **Ñ** letter. <comment137285> This small tilde is normally used to accent over the other letters.  If you `Option + N` and then for example  `o` you will get `õ`  Not entering another compatible character while the small tilde is highlighted and moving on will leave you with `˜` <comment275523> The question is for the Italian keyboard, not Swedish <comment275545> Totally fails to answer the question, tells you how to make the wrong tilde, should be deleted. <comment275563> @Thecafremo  But he doesn't want Ñ, he wants ~, and Character Picker is useless for doing that. <comment275585> @TomGewecke I know. That's why it's a comment and not an answer, as I don't know what exactly he's trying to achieve. Plus it might help someone else landing in this page looking for a way of writing **Ñ**. <comment363804> Thank you, it worked for me <comment367162> Could you explain WHY you think it is useful to add yet another copy of the same answer that was already provided twice here over 3 years ago??  I recommend you delete it.
