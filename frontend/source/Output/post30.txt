Is Apple's warranty international? <body> I'm about to travel to the US, where iPods are much cheaper than in my country. I wonder if Apple's warranty is international, and I'll be covered when I return to my country.  <answer42> Yes, Apple's warranties are international.  See Apple's Warranty Page for more details. The warranty is established in the country of purchase and if warranty service is not available in the country where the device is when service is requested, you may be on the hook for import/export duties as well as paying for the shipping.  <answer46> Apple Warranty is international and you can use your warranty on every country that apple has branch.  but other than warranty you can buy AppleCare Protection. Apple has “global repair coverage” If you carry your Apple computer or iPod when you travel and happen to need repair service, AppleCare Protection Plan offers global repair coverage.  but for this you need to purchase AppleCare Protection , and if you want go to other country to buy your product cheaper AppleCare Protection not a good Idea.   <answer51> Yes it's international.  My friend bought a MacBook in the US and had a warranty case in Switzerland. The warranty case got solved without any problems.  <answer67> Apples warranties are international except for the iPhone where the warranty is only valid in the country the phones was bought in.  <answer148> AppleCare warranty is international, sort of no questions asked (unless you take in a soaking iPod).  Apple's limited 1 year warranty is sort of international. As in, your local Apple Service Provider may provide you with warranty or may be complete a*holes about it.  <answer104542> I bought an ipad in January 2013 (10 mths ago) in the USA. It started giving problems a few weeks ago by restarting for itself every 2 mins. I took it at the apple dealer and repair center in South Africa where I currently stay, they tried fixing it but said that it needs to be replaced but they can't replace it since its under international warranty and they only deal with South African bought products.   So I guess the warranty is not international  <answer104581> Read my answer here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/13285/34885 in the comments (look for my name: madivad). I can vouch that:  h1iPhones warranties are NOT international./h1     IMPORTANT RESTRICTION FOR iPHONE AND iPAD SERVICE.   Apple may restrict warranty service for iPhone and iPad to the country where Apple or its Authorized Distributors originally sold the device.   from https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/products/ipad-english-a.html  UPDATE: I made this post in 2013, I have again checked the link above in 2017, and the situation is still the same.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hWwx.png" alt="A screengrab from Apple&#39;s own website dated 2017-08-04"  <comment66> I just read through the [iPhone 4 warranty pdf](http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/iphone/), and skimmed the iPhone 3GS dito. And I can't see that this statement is correct. They _may_ request the service in the country it was bought, but it's not demanded. <comment94252> Although note that your country e.g. in EU could enforce a longer warrenty if bought there than Apple's <comment215970> Why is AppleCare Protection not a good idea if you want to go to other country to buy your product cheaper? <comment251203> Whoa. This should be the accepted answer. Thanks. <comment251285> It's very annoying. Every answer ranks higher than mine and they're all wrong. Apple's own website says so, and I have experienced it first hand. I love Apple, but fanbois need to stop posting how great they are and guessing answers unless they know the facts. I only checked this again a few months ago and it's still the case. It MAY accepted, but by no means is it a guarantee (which in my eyes makes it no warranty either) Ahh well. It's an old post now. Lol. <comment333051> WRONG! I bought an iPhone in Australia and cracked my screen it during a trip to Brazil where they have a store and authorized service providers and they refused to fix my phone. I had to use it broken for months until I could repair in Australia. <comment366675> the Honolulu store just refused to fix my retina display because it was bought in Amsterdam <comment371035> @rfabbri check my answer below
