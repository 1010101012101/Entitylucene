Word crashes with documents with "track changes" on <body> Word suddenly started crashing every time either  ul lia document with «track changes» is opened/li li«track changes» is activated in a document and the document is changed/li /ul  This behaviour started without an update of the OS or Office.  strongEdit/strong This also happens activating the tracking on a new empty document. The behaviour is reproducible with each and every document with «track changes» activated.  <answer143565> try deleting the preference files....  I use track changes all the time on MS Word on my Mac and it normally works fine. Also you say this is reproducible behaviour on different files so it is clearly something to do with your specific installation. I suspect it might be due to a corrupt preferences file. Anyway it would be worth testing this by removing the word preference files - try both the   ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft... files  ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft files.   If you have more than one user account set up on your machine you could start off by seeing if the problem occurs on all user accounts.   <answer143882> Deleting the preferences and everything in codeLibrary/Application Support/Microsoft/code both in my account and globally did not bring any change.  I then re-installed Office, re-updated it and everything went back to normal.  <answer162811> I had the same problem and in my case I was able to get past it by disabling Balloons - "Use balloons to display changes" in the Track Changes preferences.  If you don't show the gallery on startup and you can't open Word without it first wanting to reload the crashing file, then you may need to first remove the folder:  code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.microsoft.Word.savedState/code  <answer179605> I downloaded the Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac 14.4.8 update.  After installing the update, the problem is resolved.  Note: Backup your Outlook data using the export function.  <answer200237> The problem is not with the track changes and comments but how Word tries to display them: in a Balloon...   Luckily there is a simple solution:  precodeWord -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Track Changes -&gt; "Use balloons to display changes"  /code/pre  bremove/b the tickmark from here.  You can still see the changes inside text by checking the colors and use   precodeReview tab -&gt; Comments -&gt; Previous, Next /code/pre  to step through comments (the list will be opened at a left side sidebar). Convinient way although not so fancy, but at least: bit works!/b  <comment168587> if docs become complex it is a known problem with MS word. <comment168597> @Buscar웃 is correct. I've seen tons of quirks with MS Word for Mac when you edit complex documents. I usually just boot a Win7 virtual machine to use Office, honestly. <comment168648> I know that Word is not the best with large documents but I am using it since years and it started only know with this problem which occur with every document. <comment169027> Have you tried to reset (delete) the 'Normal.dot'/'Normal.dotm ? <comment169028> typo «trac changes» (I can't [yet] edit 1 character) <comment169368> An additional test would be to use (or create) another user account on that Mac to see if the problem manifests itself. If the problem doesn't occur, then your preference files need deleting & re-creation.
