How to combine two images into one on a Mac? <body> Say I have two photos (or any images), for example with the following dimensions:   precode+----------+       +----------+ |          |       |          | |          |       |          | |320 x 428 |  and  |320 x 428 |  |          |       |          | |          |       |          | +----------+       +----------+ /code/pre  strongI want to combine them into a single image, side by side/strong. So the result should be  precode+----------------------+ |                      | |                      | |      640 x 428       | |                      | |                      | +----------------------+          /code/pre  strongWhat's the simplest way to do this on a Mac?/strong Is it possible with some default app like Preview, or would you recommend some 3rd party tool for the job?  <answer52882> I often have to do this with images of plots of data.  I use the command line tools that come in the Imagemagick package; I think I installed it on my system with MacPorts. You could also choose to install with brew (codebrew install imagemagick/code).  The actual tool you want to use from Imagemagick is the codeconvert/code tool.  If you have your two 320x428 images, say a.png and b.png, you can do  precode$&gt; convert +append a.png b.png c.png /code/pre  to create a new file, c.png, that has the a.png on the left and b.png on the right.  Alternatively, you append them vertically with code-append/code (instead of code+/code) and a.png will be on top of b.png.  With convert, you can do a ton of other things.  For example, you can switch to a different image format for the output  precode$&gt; convert +append a.png b.jpg c.tif /code/pre  This isn't a GUI application, but maybe some others might have a better solution.  Alternatively, you could put this in some sort of automator script.  <answer52883> Here's one way I just managed to solve this with.  emDisclaimer/em: If you are not familiar with the strongUnix command line/strong, you may want to pick one of the GUI-oriented solutions that others have posted.  Install the strongImageMagick/strong graphics suite, e.g. with Homebrew:   codebrew install ImageMagick/code   Alternatively, use MacPorts ( codesudo port install ImageMagick/code) or the Mac OS X binary release provided by ImageMagick. In my experience, Homebrew is the quickest, most hassle-free option.  Once you have ImageMagick installed, it's simple. Using Terminal, navigate to the directory containing the images, and create a combined version with a command such as:  precodemontage -geometry 100% left.jpg right.jpg merged.jpg /code/pre  There's multitude of options available; to learn about them, see:  http://www.imagemagick.org/script/montage.php  <answer52885> There is Graphic Converter (free to try).  So you could: open new picture 640 x 480; then in turn open each of the components, copy all, and paste into the new picture.  Drag them into place where you want them.  Then Save As... the format you want.  <answer52886> This solution uses only Preview and may be handy if you can't install software on a machine. It is, however, not elegant.  Say your images are called A and B. Then:  ol liOpen A in Preview./li liSelect All, Copy./li liIn the Tools menu, select Size and adjust the width to the sum of the width of the two images (in your example, 640 px). Keep the height. This will result in a stretched version of A./li liPaste the copy of the original A and move it manually to the left./li liIn another window, open B./li liSelect All, Copy./li liPaste into A, moving it to the right./li liSave as a new image./li /ol  Since, of course, Preview does not offer any proper image editing tools and no way to exactly position the two images, the ImageMagick solutions posted here are preferable. (Or why not just install MacPorts' GIMP package while you're at it and enjoy a fully equipped image editor?)  <answer52887> Pixelmator is only around $30 from the app store and its a full photoshop replacement for 99% of users. It will merge your images and do a thousand other things besides. Highly recommended.  <answer52988> Speaking of free GUI tools, Seashore App is an open source project much better at working with images than Preview.app.  It has better tools much on the lines of popular editors (including shortcuts) and I guess if you try you should be doing just fine without much help from us.  It supports layers, filters, channels and supports almost all image formats, plus it has better image / layer selection and resizing tools that may be better suited for your image editing needs.  ol liOpen both the images with Seashore./li liCopy over the second one into the first one. Seashore will ask you if you want to create a New Layer or Anchor it with the one already there. (see screenshot)./li liClick on New Layer./li liUse the Move tool (right most selected button in toolbar in the screenshot) to align your layer to the right of the previous one./li liChoose Image boundaries option from Image menu (Third item from top Cmd + Opt + C) increase the image boundary to the Right in your case by the current width of the image (assuming both images are of same size)./li liSave as png or jpg according to your needs./li /ol  Voila!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7F3W7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer104665> Do it online for free...  http://www.quickpicturetools.com  Beats messing around or installing other programs.  <answer107817> The easiest way is to use Graphic Converter. Open the Convert and Modify window, select all the images you want to stitch together on the left hand selection pane, and select a folder for the output in the right hand selection pane (otherwise you might overwrite your originals).  On the left hand side of the main window select Function - Concat....  Click GO (LHS at bottom), this will open a dialogue box that asks if you want them arranged in a row only, column only or a matrix of N x M images.  <answer115312> I'm a know-nothing when it comes to computers, but this question is all over the internet.  I make all kinds of pictures in Pages, then save the page as a pdf. I open the pdf in Preview and resave it as a jpg. Then I import the jpg in iphoto and do whatever I want to it there - crop it or play with the colors etc. Then I mail it to myself in whatever size I want. This is serious silliness by most people's standards.  Well it works - and you don't have to be a geek to do it :)  <answer118084> Using TextEdit, you can copy paste (or drag) the 2 images in to TextEdit window side by Side.  Save as PDF then Open- Save as JPEG after witch you can modify the image size in Preview.

Make two pictures into single one.  <answer127759> Open both images side by side in Preview, take a screenshot with command-shift-4.  <answer137376> The simplest way I know uses Preview. Open both photos with Preview, position their windows side-by-side (flush) in front of your desktop and then use Preview's "Take a screen shot" command with the "from Selection" option. Select around the perimeter of both photos together and it will create a montage for you.  <answer137382> How to do this with the tools to hand: strongPreview/strong .app and strongScreen Capture/strong.  ol liOpen up strongany Application/strong that lets you have a clean neat white background.

Open a new powerpoint file, open the photos you want to join or save into one PDF, use the Crop command (Shift+Control+Command+4) to crop the images one by one and paste them in the powerpoint file. Adjust the size of photos and placement on the slide. Save the slide or file as a PDF. Simple.   However if you want to merge two photos into one (with one merging into the other) there are other apps out there which can do it for you.  <answer249421> This is probably quite old, but for people who still encounter this stuff (I just had to merge 2 sides of my card which is the new "car papers".  I tend to use pixlr.com, which does NOT require signup, it's simular to photoshop you can just upload your two images, crop, transform w/e move them on different layers etc. Then you can save it as a pixlr file or PNG / JPG  <comment60482> If there's an easier way install ImageMagick on OS X, please leave a comment, and I'll edit the answer accordingly... <comment60483> Ah, thanks! Looks like ImageMagick offers several ways to do this; I just finished writing down [how I solved it with ImageMagick](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/52883/150). :) <comment60484> There are now two nice command-line answers, but I think the majority of Mac users would prefer a GUI-oriented solution. Post one (something that's simple but effective) and I'll accept it! <comment60489> I'm not sure it's actually possible to enjoy the GIMP. It's useable, sure, but not *enjoyable*. <comment60490> Thanks! Maybe not elegant as you say, but a passable quick solution. I actually tried this before posting the question, but had some problems around step 3 and gave it up. Got it working with these instructions. <comment60500> I haven't specifically tested this, but GraphicConverter has a very powerful batch-processing feature for sequences of image-processing routines, including some Automator and AppleScript support. I'll bet you can find a way to create a batch process that will do what you need in GraphicConverter. <comment60513> While there are a few free alternatives in this thread, +1 for Pixelmator which can do this and much more for a good price. <comment60523> You can use `brew install ImageMagick`, if you have homebrew installed. Which you should. <comment60538> @Matthew: what makes Homebrew better than MacPorts? <comment60567> http://tedwise.com/2010/08/28/homebrew-vs-macports/ <comment109467> I tried cm2's answer on OS X Mountain Lion with ImageMagick 6.8, and I found that the `append` flag combined the images the other way around; `-append` combined the images side by side, and `+append` one on top of the other. <comment109472> Interesting that the behavior changed.  I was using ImageMagick 6.7.2 when the `append` behaved as described in the answer. <comment113285> (Having used Homebrew now for 6 months or so, I agree with @Matthew, it's been way better than MacPorts.) <comment126446> At least my Macs (running OS X 10.6.8 and 10.8.4) don't seem to have Graphic Converter pre-installed, so this is not necessarily the *easiest* way. <comment149682> If they are scaled you will lose a lot of DPI. You better use photoshop <comment161583> Great stuff, you may add `-auto-orient` for auto orient images. <comment163242> nice work with real example (+) <comment163246> Thanks! :) Does anyone know how to control the List formatting in these posts? <comment163253> Yes :-) Compare my edit to your version to see what I did. <comment163319> Mine seems to restart the count after the images and is difficult to set off the count. <comment170004> This command line approach really helps a lot in my research. Thanks a lot sir! <comment199539> Bought it. I don't recommend it. There's no resizing or scaling options so if one source image is smaller than than the other you get empty image space filled with white space. Heck the app doesn't even let you specify what color to use for the empty space. eg: black instead of white. It's just too limited in functionality to use. I'd rather use the command line, Photoshop, or the quickpicturetools.com site which did exactly what I hoped THIS app would do, but didn't. The only options this app has are "Horizontal" "Vertical", and "Quit" I found "Quit" to be the best option. <comment244677> @hobbyte in ImageMagick 6.9.1 with OS 10.10, `+append` combined the images side by side, and `-append` one on top of the other <comment264587> Well. this is crazy. <comment271237> Requires you first have Office, making it the most expensive solution so far. <comment341074> Seashore crashes on 10.12 sierra as soon as you launch it. so... <comment341075> Graphic Converter is the "swiss army knife" for image manipulations - but it is a commercial tool, not a free tool. It is great, but at a cost. <comment341076> It would by my first recommendation for the job, weren't it a commercial tool. It may have free trial, but as far as I know the free trial is quite limited, and usually stamps the resulting images with some watermark that renders them unusable, and it is not cheap to buy. <comment341079> Web based Image editing has one flaw - the moment you upload the images, they are not yours anymore. The server can give them to anyone without your permission. <comment356945> Does anyone have a handy mnemonic for remember whether `+append/-append` is associated with horizontal/vertical, without doing both 50% of the time?
