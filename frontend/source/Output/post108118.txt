iOS 7: call screen background photo bugged? <body> During a call to any contact, on call screen is displaying hard blurred image. This image is a user photo attached to its contact in address book. The issue is, that this photo is SAME on EVERY contact I call, no matter is there set photo on contact or not.  I have tryed to remove this image from contact it belongs to, but that doesn't do the trick, it still appear in ANY contact I called.  Any solution to remove or change this image?  <answer108130> I occasionally have the same problem, usually only after I decline a call by pressing the lock button. A reboot fixes it though… try rebooting!  <comment126764> I occasionally have the same problem - a reboot fixes it though… try rebooting :) <comment126769> Solved via reboot, thank you!
