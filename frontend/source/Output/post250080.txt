Time Machine back up to Time Capsule fails <body> Recently Time Machine has stopped backing up to my Time Capsule on both my MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. It spends a few hours "Preparing backup" and then just gives up.  I've had a look in Console and when it says it is "Preparing backup" codecom.apple.backupd/code is running an codeinitial consistency scan for '/'/code and then when it stops I get the following messages in the Console:  precodeError writing event cache at /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/... : Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=20 "Not a directory" Error writing to backup log. NSFileHandleOperationException:*** /code/pre  The latest backup on my MBA is 23 July and on my MBP is 24 July so I think that coincides with me updating OS X but I can't be sure. These are the things I have tried so far (I've turned Time Machine off on my MBP so I can focus on getting the Air working first)  ul liTurning time machine off and back on again/li liReselecting the back up disk/li liHard resetting the time capsule/li liFactory resetting the time capsule/li liBooting into Safe Mode on my MBA and then restarting into normal mode/li li"First aid" (Disk Utility) on my MBA/li liRenaming the Time Capsule to a short name/li /ul  The only thing I haven't done is erase the contents of the Time Capsule for two reasons. 1) I don't have a hard drive with enough capacity remaining to archive the data to. 2) When I enter Time Machine all of the backups are there and available for me to restore so I don't want to loose all that.  Please let me know if you have any ideas. The TC has over 300 GB of space remaining.  strongUPDATE/strong Here is the contents of the code.sparsebundle/code (located within the 'Data' folder) that is the backup (the codebands/code folder is empty): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ytcFc.png" alt="contents of sparsebundle created by Time Machine"  <answer268032> Usually, I wouldn't post an answer like this  (rather, just delete the question) as my solution to this issue is so untechnical; however, I feel that it might just save somebody a head of hair.  It turns out that the Ethernet capable connecting the Time Capsule to the network switch was damaged. I never checked it initially because the Time Capsule was appearing on the network and my MacBook Air would back up to it fine, but all I can assume is that my MacBook Pro but more stress on the cable. Long story short, I've put a brand new Ethernet cable in and it worked first time, flawlessly.  Now, before I did so I had followed this tutorial to keep using the same machine after a change to the computer, so I don't know if that did have any effect or not.  I suppose the moral of the story here is that networking is a pain and you shouldn't overlook anything, even if it seems to be working perfectly!  <comment310488> If you turn off Time Machine, mount the Time Capsule in Finder, browse to the Backups.backupdb folder, open the disc image that corresponds to your computer, do you have a folder called inprogress something? If you remove the inprogress folder it usually helps with TM not being able to complete a backup. Delete the folder and enable TM and try a "Backup now". Otherwise perhaps a screenshot of the folder structure on the mounted discimage would help. <comment310560> @Niklas I have just uploaded a screenshot of the contents of the `.sparsebundle` as I don't have a 'Backups.backupdb' folder which I believe is because I'm backing up over the network? Let me know if you need any more information... Thank you in advance.
