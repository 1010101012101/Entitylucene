XCode 4.5 downloading documentation <body> I have installed XCode 4.5. During the installation there was an error about downloading the documentation. I did not pay much attention, but I think the error was same as that mentioned in:  this question.  I tried the solution as mentioned in the post, but there is no file named as: "strongcom.apple.adc.documentation.AppleOSX10_8.CoreReference.docset/strong" as stated in the answer.  The main problem I have with the documentation is that it is incomplete. strongWhile some of the pages are displayed properly, the other pages are blank./strong   How do I repair the documentation? I am ready to re-download the documentation. I do NOT want to download the entire XCode 4.5 again. Please help!!!  strongNote:/strong I am using Mountain Lion 10.8.  <answer68920> You can do that directly form Xcode preferences:  ol liOpen Xcode/li liMenu emXcode/em  emPreferences/em/li liGo to the tab emDownload/em /li liGo to the sub-tab emDocumentation/em/li liSelect the documentation you want to re-install/li liClick the kbd-/kbd icon below the documentations list for moving it to the trash./li liClick install on the desired documentation/li /ol  Maybe you can skip the step 6 if Xcode shows that the documentation is not installed.  <comment80092> Wow, the documentation files are really large. I guess I will just look into tutorials from youtube for now. Thanks for the answer. <comment80093> @Robik Did it work? If you are interested in iOS programming there is a wonderful course on iTunes U. It comes frome the university of Stanford. It is called "iPad and iPhone application development" <comment80113> 1. I did not download the docs because they were too large and internet speed here is too slow. I will to it afterwards. In fact, my internet stops working whenever I pause or turn off the MacOSX in VMware. I think I need to start another thread for that. 2. About the videos: We downloaded videos from youtube. (BUT THEY WERE FROM 2010 and a lot has changed!), so I am now installing iTunes in windows and surfing about how to download iTunes videos (because streaming is really not an option in my case). I will add more comments afterwards. <comment80114> I found this link (inside itunes): https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ipad-iphone-application-development/id473757255# . Are these videos the latest? and are these lectures compliant with XCode 4.5? <comment80115> Also, videos are being downloaded too slowly. I googled, but could come up with a way to download less size/ low quality videos instead. Is there a way to do this? <comment80119> @Robik These are the videos. However you should open a new question, otherwise no one will be able to find this question by using the search functionality and the information will help only you! ;-) <comment80151> Yes. I asked about the internet connection problem here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/68981/download-videos-faster and about video download here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/68981/download-videos-faster. <comment80152> Sorry, the link about internet connection problem is this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/68945/computer-should-be-restarted-to-connect-internet-mountain-lion-on-vmware-8
