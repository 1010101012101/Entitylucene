Mount .NRG image file on OSX 10.6 <body> I have a Nero Disk Image(.nrg) File and I would like to mount it on OSX to copy it's contents. I've tried to rename to .iso and to use NRG2ISO with no luck.  Any tips ?  <answer19073> A little googling led me to this thread on strongMacRumors.com/strong  It appears that if the ISO is a single session CD image you can just knock the first 600 bytes off with a terminal command and it'll be readable as an ISO (change file type to .iso after performing the command).  strongI'd recommend making a backup of the .nrg file before trying this though!/strong  precode$ dd if=image.nrg of=cdrom.iso bs=512 skip=600 /code/pre  (&uarr; credit to balamw on macrumors forums)  Also, If you're just looking to extract pictures from the disk, File Juicer may also be strongworth a look!/strong  <answer52516> Had the same experience as the OP. Tried using nrg2iso, tried renaming the file to .iso and also tried the codedd/code command from that MacRumors thread. Nothing worked.  However, I then found nrg4iso which worked perfectly! The project has been abandoned since 2007 but it still works.  <answer119971> With em.nrg/em images from audio CDs, the solutions proposed in the other answers do not work (e.g. failing with emSource is a Nero DAO (Disk at once) with 1 session(s)/em ).  However, the commercial Deamon Tools are now available for Mac OSX. Using these, you can mount the em.nrg/em as an Audio CD.  <answer199822> dd variant not work for me. So, i find another one with poweriso:  http://www.poweriso.com/download.php  Use: ./poweriso convert ~/Desktop/image.nrg -o ~/Desktop/image.iso -ot iso  <comment20886> Thank you for the tip, but this didn't work for me :( (when I mount the resulting iso I get 'not recognized') <comment20924> dd just reads the in file (if) so it's not writing to the nrg file in this case. <comment135603> I tried `nrg4iso`, but it erred with the following message: "Source is a Nero DAO (Disc at once) image with 2 session(s)."
