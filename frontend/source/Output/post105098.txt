How do I re-enable the Press and Hold character picker on OS X Lion? <body> I disabled the character picker by reading this other question, but I want to remove that change and restore the picker.  When I type code-g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true/code into Terminal, it does not work.  How can I re-enable the Press &amp; Hold character picker after disabling it?  <answer105099> The command to enable the Press &amp; Hold character picker is as follows:  precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true /code/pre  supNote the addition of codedefaults write/code which was missing from your command./sup  hr  If it does not work in certain apps after performing this, restart/reload those apps (e.g. codekillall -HUP Finder/code). Alternatively, log out of your user or just reboot your computer.  <answer147061> As grgarside mentioned   precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true /code/pre  will enable Press &amp; Hold.  But just in case anyone comes across this, this additional command will enable the Press &amp; Hold functionality to work in Terminal as well which it does not do by default.  precodedefaults write com.apple.terminal ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true /code/pre  <comment295474> How to enable this on the latest OS X ?
