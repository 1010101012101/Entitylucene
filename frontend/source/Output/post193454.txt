Windows Zoomit like tool from mac <body> I have been using zoomit on windows. With that tool: I can write on screen, zoom screen, draw shapes on screen while doing presentation. Also, I can run a stopwatch for break during presentation. Blacken, whiten the screen. Is there such kind of tool for Mac? I saw zoomit for mac and its absolutely rubbish which only zooms and doesn't nothing extra like window's zoomit.   https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897434.aspx  <answer256928> There's a great app on Apple Store named "Draw on My Screen EZ". Link to app  <comment230609> Which application are you using when doing presentations? Powerpoint, Keynote or something else? <comment230615> @patrix have a look at the screenshots http://s1313.photobucket.com/user/cooldudeabhi/library/Zoomit  I use simple tools like text editor & terminal to do programming based demos(presentations).
