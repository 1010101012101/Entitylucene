Mysql process takes 500 mb of primary memory <body> I have a MBA 2013, and its not more than few days that I installed MySQL. I have not created any database in mysql yet, but still it takes a lot of memory on RAM. I have configured it to start automatically on boot up. So i would be glad if anyone can help me out with understanding why is that MySQL takes so much of memory and what is the solution to tune it?  <answer104250> You can get exact memory allocation of any process with a quick command:  precodesudo sysdiagnose PID /code/pre  (Where PID is the process ID of the mysql binary or the name of the mysql process you want to inspect deeply). There is a manual page and you will want to start with vmmap.txt and all memory files. I'm not certain that 500 mb of allocation is a problem or even of concern without understanding the options you have configured for the database and what the rest of your workload is.
