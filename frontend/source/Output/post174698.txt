How to record a screen film of an iPad? <body> I would like to record a screen film of my iPad. If possible, I would like to include my spoken comments.  How can I do that ?  <answer174708> You connect your iPad to a mac, open up iTunes and quicktime. in quicktime, go to file-new movie recording.  there will be a little down arrow next to the record button, click the down arrow and choose your iPad.  then hit the record button.  I don't know if this works with 30 pin iPads. i know it works with lightning ones.  if you don't have a mac, i think you're out of luck unless you jailbreak.  <answer174737> If you have an iPad with a lightning connector and iOS 8 you can open QuickTime on your Yosemite Mac and make a recording. If you don't have a Mac or a iPad with lightning connector you could use Reflector which is using Airplay.

It also includes an option to turn the microphone on during the session, by long-pressing or hard-pressing the screen recording button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jwGfv.png" alt="enter image description here"  iOS 11 is still in beta but it's now in empublic/em beta which means you don't need to be a developer to enroll and test it.  <comment205738> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151305/how-to-record-iphone-screen-on-os-x-yosemite <comment205791> I have an iPad mini with Lightning cable. But I am looking for a solution on the iPad. <comment205792> This solution with the Mac requires Yosemite and iOS 8, I think. And I have neither. <comment205825> My iPad has a Lightning connector, but not iOS 8. I will try Reflector, which looks nice. However, I would prefer a solution needing only the iPad. <comment205830> The iPad can not record its own screen. You need to have a computer that do the recording. This is not an recommendation but I know that that it is possible to record the screen if you have an jailbroken iPad. But again, that is nothing I recommend. <comment205906> I don't do jailbreak. <comment206011> Try with the Reflector application and record on your Mac/PC. As I said before the iPad can't (it's an missing function in my opinion) record it's own screen. <comment211707> Now I have an iPad on iOS 8, and I am interested in a solution for recording his screen, preferably without any other machine. <comment211708> Now, I have an all new iPad, on iOS 8, and I am interested in a solution to record his screen, preferably without any other machine.
