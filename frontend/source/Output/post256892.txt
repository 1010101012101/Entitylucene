How do I launch a file with the extension .darwin.amd64? <body> How do I launch or open a file with the extension .darwin.amd64?  Double clicking it results in: "There is no application available to open the document..."  <answer256910> If there is no file extension, then it is most likely strongMach-O/strong file format. This kind of files without file extension can be executed within terminal by dragging the file to the terminal window and pressing enter. Another way is to use terminal to codecd/code into the directory containing the file, and executing code./filename.darwin.amd64/code, of course replace emfilename/em with your actual filename.  <comment320560> What is the full filename and where did it come from? <comment320564> What *exactly* are you trying to do?  What program/application/document are you trying to open? <comment320596> thank you sir - I was forgetting the ./ part
