Hard link '~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs' to ~/iCloud <body> Is it possible to do this at all? I've tried the following command:  precodeln /Users/Rowan/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents /Users/Rowan/iCloud /code/pre  which results in:  precodeln: /Users/Rowan/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents: Is a directory /code/pre  I can't seem to find how to add an argument to codeln/code in order to 'allow' directories.  <answer219552> ln(1) on OS X does not support folder hard links. A symlink would work fine instead.  precodeln -s /Users/Rowan/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents /Users/Rowan/iCloud /code/pre  If you really want a hard link, you can install coreutils with Homebrew and use  precodegln -d /Users/Rowan/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents /Users/Rowan/iCloud /code/pre  <comment265535> I've decided to go with the second option, as it's prettier in the Finder. Thank you!
