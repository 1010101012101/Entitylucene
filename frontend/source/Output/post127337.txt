nVidia + Mavericks Drivers <body> Is anyone aware of official nVidia drivers for 9x series cards and OSX Mavericks?  I'm aware of these but they only seem to support 8 series cards and I have a 9800GTX+  <answer127342> Looking at the nVida site and using they driver find engine they do not have the driver, so nobody else would have it.  <comment149242> They do some OSX drivers, but they're not usually found through the driver engine sadly.
