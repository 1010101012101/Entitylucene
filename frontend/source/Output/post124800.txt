Additional languages in dictionary dashboard widget? <body> Ok I added more languages to the build-in dictionary application and they are available in the desktop application. Now it would be great if they were also available in the dictionary dashboard widget. So far they are not... Is this also possible?  <comment146046> try this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58823/how-to-switch-language-of-os-x-dictionary
