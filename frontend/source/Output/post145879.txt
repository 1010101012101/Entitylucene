Get Swipe Left in Mail To Show 'Delete' Instead of 'Archive' <body> A new strongswipe-left/strong feature to delete emails was promised to us in iOS 8 for the Mail application.  And yet, when I swipe left, it only shows codeMore/code, codeFlag/code and codeArchive/code.  That is beyond disappointing.  How can I get it to show codeDelete/code instead of archive from the inbox?  I need a fast way to delete mails so they go straight to the emTrash/em.  And so far, the only time I see codeDelete/code when I swipe left is if I'm actually emin/em the Trash folder.  strongNote:/strong This is for a Gmail account.  <answer145882> You're in luck - it's there. You just need to swipe emfaster and further/em to the left. Make it a "full sweep" from right to left.   This'll result in immediately deleting the mail message. In case you'll accidentally delete a message - which is imminent #imho -  you simply "shake" your iPhone to ask you if you want to undo it.  In case something is not working as expected, you can verify the settings through strongSettings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  Swipe Options/strong to see if the common actions are up to your standard.  <answer145884> ol liGo to strongSettings/strong → strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong. /li liSelect the Gmail account in question. /li liSelect strongAccount/strong → strongAdvanced/strong./li liIn the second section called "Move Discarded messages into" change Archive Mailbox to strongDeleted Mailbox/strong.

I checked and now I get the Trash option as well! (even though the message doesn't make sense, we are setting the Swipe Right and not the Swipe Left as Archive).  <answer146956> When you archive a message, it moves to the All Mail folder. It does not delete the message from the Gmail account. You can learn more about the Gmail archive feature in Gmail Help. Archive replaces all delete options when you use a Gmail account, including tapping the Trash icon while you view  a message and selecting Edit to manage multiple messages.  You can disable this feature in Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  Gmail Account  Account  Advanced  Move Discarded Messages Into:  <comment171925> With a Gmail email account the default is not to deleted an email, but to remove it from the inbox, and leave it in the 'All' Mail folder.  Thus the swipe Faster and Further will still only Archive the email and not delete it. <comment171926> That's peculiar. I've tested it with a POP3, Office365 and Hotmail account. All having the same behaviour. I guess it's a misassumption on my part in thinking that Gmail would act the same. <comment171928> Omg they put this in a not-so-obvious area..  Thank you so much!  Worked! <comment171981> Yes Gmail is very different in many ways.  Also I would delete your answer as it implies that the 'quick' swipe in fact is the method needed to delete, and when the email user finally looks in their all mail folder there are going to be disappointed to see that the emails they spent time deleting are not deleted. <comment172607> Hi, I think that as this question was posted the next day after iOS 8 was released that's worth while noting that your answer applies to iOS 8 ?(I've not got gmail set up on iOS 8, so cannot confirm it myself) <comment289159> Doesnt seem to work on GMAIL iOs App. Swiping still only shows "archive" option. Also swiping the lock screen notification still only shows "archive" option. <comment289179> @haemse what's your gmail account set up as, the online web account settings? Gmail started off with the intention you don't need to delete, only archive from the inbox. I think you can change this to delete. <comment289272> @haemse just to recap, the Gmail app has completely different setting for mail accounts. Ask about the Gmail App in a new question - but I think it's not supported, but 'Inbox by Google' CAN delete emails.
