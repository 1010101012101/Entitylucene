Finder not updating immediately nfs share content <body> We share the content of multiple linux servers through NFS. It's then mounted on a few macs (OSX Yosemite 10.10.5) by an automount map using Freeipa.  Everything works properly except that sometimes, the Finder doesn't refresh folder content.  To debug, I've checked in Terminal the exact content of the faulty displayed folder and codecd /server/nfs/folder &amp;&amp; ls -la/code show me the exact content. Then launching codeopen ./code in Terminal will open a Finder window and the displayed content will be correct.  strongIs there a way to correct this or to force the finder to refresh more often?/strong   export argument:  precode/mnt/disk1 *(rw,insecure,no_root_squash,sync,mp,subtree_check,fsid=3) /code/pre  automount key:  precode-fstype=nfs,rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,hard,intr,timeo=600,retrans=2,wsize=32768,rsize=32768,noatime hostname:/mnt/disk1 /code/pre  Thanks for your help.  <comment338103> Starting tomorrow, I'm going to test using an AppleScript like suggested on this topic: [Is there a way to refresh a Finder file listing?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/49546/219094)
