Hidden Folder not showing in Finder with show all hidden files <body> I have a FreeBSD server where I store my web files. One of the files I have been using for years has the naming convention code._Folder/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cARhw.png" alt="Finder before Go To Folder Dialog"  When I try to open this file in the Finder it doesn't even show, even with the following preference activated:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE /code/pre  When I go to codeGo &gt; Go to Folder &gt;/code  Then type code/Volumes/web/website/public_html/._Folder/code  In the background I can see that the Finder updates to show the hidden folder. If I hit codecancel/code on this dialog without hitting codeenter/code I can see the folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vYQPP.png" alt="Finder showing the hidden folder"  But when I turn down the triangle, it disappears.  When I have the codeGo to Folder/code dialog open and press codeenter/code the Finder shows the contents of the folder for about 2 seconds before it dumps me into a duplicated version of the codepublic_html/code parent folder with a path of code/Volumes/web/website/public_html/public_html/code. This folder at this path does not exist, but the Finder shows it.  If I try to access the folder again, I get the following message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oxPM2.png" alt="Screenshot from Finder"   I've checked the permissions on the folders to make sure that's not the issue. I can edit the files and the folder on a Windows machine as well, and on the FreeBSD machine from the command line, but would really love to use some of the apps on my Mac.  The code._/code naming convention is this way to match what is on the production server on the web.  All of the hidden files and folders with a single code./code character in front only are working. Anything with a code._/code isn't showing at all.  I'm running 10.8.5 on a 3.33gHz 6 Core Xeon.  Any suggestions are appreciated.  <answer123016> I think Finder is out...          Mac OS X does not show you companion files unless you use Terminal, and sometimes not even then.  (It shows eminvisible/em files rather easily, but to Mac OS X, both "MyFile" and "._MyFile" are two parts of the emsame/em file, and it doesn't normally return two directory entries for one file.)  You only see these companion files on non-HFS disks that you move to other operating systems.      http://lists.apple.com/archives/applescript-users/2006/Jun/msg00180.html  So, the only Options I see is using VCP7, or Paralles, etc., to have a pseodo way to see them in Finder, or....  Write a script to list those files in a window &amp; maybe link them back the the real ._ files.  <answer123045> I can't seem to find an answer in their support section, but you might give the 30-day trial of Path Finder a try and see if it lets you see the ._ files.  http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/  <comment143781> In my case, '._Folder' is a real folder. It's just named that way, but that link you've provided explains a lot as to why the OS wouldn't want to show files with that naming convention. Thanks. I think I might make the case to rename the folder to something else.
