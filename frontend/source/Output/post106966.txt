How to run third-party iOS apps in OS X? <body> I have a lot of awesome iOS apps such as Procreate that I would I like to use in OSX. Currently, I am only able to run my own iOS apps in OSX through Xcode. I heard some rumours that thirdparty iOS apps may be possible in the future to work with OSX as Apple tries to integrate its ecosystem even closer to its own services -- yet I would like to get it now:      strongHow to get iOS apps working in OS X? Any sandbox using things such as Xcode for third-party apps?/strong   <answer106979> The reason you can run programs that you have source code and libraries for is that Xcode cross compiles that code to run on x86 architecture inside an iOS simulator.   What you are looking for is an iOS emulator and that's simply something that Apple doesn't provide. There are emulators around, but they all seem to be startup / venture funded efforts at this point. Time will tell if they decide to release the product to paying users or otherwise monetize that work but today, there are no feasible options to do what you ask.   Unless, of course, you have source code for those third party apps in which case you are one Xcode build away from simulating those apps on your Mac.   <comment125507> Are you looking for something similar to this http://gameplayer.ipadian.net/ <comment125508> @Simon I don't want to mess up with PC-virtualisation things, I am surprised if Apple has not done it yet -- perhaps it just waits. <comment125509> Thats why I meant similar (I know you dont want PC), but similar concept for OSX. <comment125510> @Simon yes, good point. It is a cry that I cannot use a Procreate with my Wacom/OSX for instance. I just don't want to bother with too much technicalities, better keep things simple. <comment125511> Hopefully something will come up. If I find anything, I shall of course inform you. <comment125515> I emailed the developers of iPadian, and they have emailed me back saying iPadian is not available for OS X for now, but maybe used with virtualisation software eg VirtualBox (which as you stated above is far from ideal). <comment125519> VirtualBox will not help as it is for Intel x86 processors, IOS apps run on ARM chips <comment125520> @Mark If that's correct then they should have stated that in their email response (I would have thought). <comment125521> @Simon That looks like they have ported some apps to Windows not run general iOS apps which is what the question is about. From their FAQ "You will not be able to play your iPad apps or access iTunes on your computer using this software" <comment125522> @Mark Fair enough, well spotted.
