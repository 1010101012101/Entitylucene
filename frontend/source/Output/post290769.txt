4k video playback stutter on 2013 Retina Macbook Pro <body> Is it expected that 4k video (shot on the iPhone SE) cannot be played without stutter on the 2013 Macbook Pro?  It seems to be really a limitation of the graphics hardware as the effect is the same in finder preview, quicktime player, or iMovie.  Speaking of which, iMovie becomes unusable because the previews that play everywhere don't work well.  In the stuttering playback the sound is continuous, but frames drop all the time.  Graphics Hardware: Intel Iris 1536 MB CPU: 2,4 GHz Intel Core i5  I find this quite unlikely because the same video plays without problems on a 2012 Macbook Air, but this machine has a much lower res display too.  The machine is otherwise idle as confirmed by Activity Monitor. What could be the reason for the stutter?
