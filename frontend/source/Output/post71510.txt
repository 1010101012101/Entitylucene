Can non iPhone iOS devices (iPad specifically) be used to dial short USSD codes for carrier information? <body> My data carrier provides USSD code to check the voice &amp; data balance in the sim &amp; iPad3 doesn't seem to have a way to dial them.  So how can I send USSD codes without jailbreaking my iPad? Is it possible at all?  USSD codes are like this: code*123*1#/code for data balance.  <answer71513> Nope, not possible! The USSD code would be sent over a voice call of sorts, but there's no phone app on the iPad. The cellular access is strictly for data (at least without jailbreaking).  You'll just have to find a different way of checking your data balance! You could just keep track manually by going to Settings - General - Usage - Cellular Usage. That will allow you to reset your usage statistics and then keep tabs on how much data you've used up to that point.  <comment83136> Too bad, I am already keeping tab on my usage, its just needed to know the pack balance & expiration date, as on my carrier when data pack gets exhausted, it starts deducting money out of voice balance & that's expensive. <comment83627> @Ashfame Many carriers allow web access to the same data and some even have apps in the App Store to make this sort of query easier on you. <comment83631> @bmike Yep! I got to know my carrier `Airtel, India` also has an app to check voice/data balance. Thanks!
