Installing Xcode command line tools error: The package “DeveloperToolsCLI.pkg” is untrusted <body> When I try to install the Xcode Command Line Tools I get the error message: "The package “DeveloperToolsCLI.pkg” is untrusted." I can't seem to find the answer to this problem anywhere, how do you fix this?  <answer173730> Probably the certificate is outdated. To circumvent this the following procedure should work:  ul liOpen "System Preferences"/li liHit "Security &amp; Privacy"/li liHit the tab "General"/li liClick the lock and enter your admin password/li liat "Allow applications from anywhere" mark the radio button "Anywhere"/li lithen click the button "Allow from anywhere"/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2yXoL.png" alt="sec"  or like indicated in the screenshot above control-click individual apps/installer-apps and select "Open". This probably doesn't work for the DeveloperToolsCLI.pkg but for other apps.  <answer174353> Funnily Enough I had the exact same issue as you did about 10 minutes ago and stumbled across here via google.   I still had issues after relaxing the code signing checks on OSX also.   I logged into https://developer.apple.com/downloads and downloaded the CLI package from there (then installed them directly. )   <answer205343> I fixed this by changing the date, klanomath's answer didn't work for me.  Seems like the problem is trusting the certs, so being Sept 2015, I started to download the tools and strongonly after the download had started/strong changed the date to Sept 2013 in the Date &amp; Time dialog of the System Preferences.  You cannot change the date before the download starts, otherwise it will say the source is not trusted.  <comment204394> Where did you get the package from? <comment204395> Does http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/44135/command-line-tools-fail-to-install-osx-lion-10-7-3-xcode-4-3 help? <comment204396> I installed the package from XcodePreferencesDownloads <comment207997> I had already done exactly this a while back and somehow OS X set it back to "Mac App Store" without my consent.  Also, this didn't work.  Downloading and installing from link below in @Damian Nikodem's answer worked. <comment251065> Bahahaha this is genius. Also, it's funny how they autoupdate tools, but not certificates. Defeats the whole purpose of the autoupdating
