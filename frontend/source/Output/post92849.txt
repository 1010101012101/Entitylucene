Kill processes automatically that get over x % CPU <body> I have a (rather annoying) process on my iMac that tends to get out of control.  subUnfortunately, it's not possible to get rid of it. Much as I want to./sub  This process is emfine/em at first - using 1-2 % of my dual-core CPU.   Then it happens. The entire machine slows down. If I can manage to get Activity Monitor open, I can see that the offending process is using 200%, even em300%/em of my CPU.  Not fun.  If I can get Activity Monitor or Terminal open, and kill the process, it will restart itself and behave like a good little process. For a while. The it goes crazy again.  Being an iOS developer, I'm thinking that the best way to combat this process is an automated assistant.  What I have in mind is a background process that would kill the offending process as soon as its CPU usage hits X%, say 50 or 75%. The the process will restart and become sane without my intervention.  Is it possible? I can write code, AppleScript, emanything/em to make the machine usable again.  <answer92850> This post suggest using monit.br As you have given no details as to the nature of the process, I can't advise whether their suggested config would be of any use for you.  <comment108906> Is this a user process, or a system process? Have you tried `nice` on the process? <comment108910> @demure Nope. What's the usage, and what does it do? <comment108912> `nice` can change the scheduling priority of a process. see `man nice`[*](http://linux.die.net/man/1/nice). Example: `nice -n 19 process_name` <comment108913> Does that run on OSX? the blog is for Linux and the download page ncludes several Unicies nut not OSX. I ask as i is likelyto deal with system level APIs which differ in OSX. <comment108914> @Undo what is the process that misbehaves? <comment108915> As you can see from the [download page](http://mmonit.com/monit/download/), there is a  macosx-universal binary. <comment108917> SOrry I missed that the first time I read it <comment108918> @Mark `Family Protector Daemon` :( <comment108919> @Undo Under OSX anti vurus programs call more issues than they solve :) One of he reasons many prople recommend not using them <comment108920> @Mark We don't use the AV part. I'm an iOS Dev :) <comment108921> @Undo uninstall Intego antivirus, you don't need it.
