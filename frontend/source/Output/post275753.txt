Problems with temperature and Mac fan <body> My Mac is showing lots of errors and running weirdly. The battery only lasts for a short time, there is a fan noise when I use it and I feel the temperature is high.  In the report it says the following:     *** Panic Report ***br   panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff801db6ac55): "zalloc: zone map exhausted while allocating from zone semaphores, likely due to memory leak in zone ipc ports (3957835360 total bytes, 24736458 elements allocated)"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2782.50.9/osfmk/kern/zalloc.c:2521   <answer275754> Have you tried resetting your SMC (System Management Controller)?  I had a similar problem with an old MacBook Pro 15" that I solved with this:  You might check this link where Apple support indicates what you need to check before resetting your SMC.  Steps are:  strongReset the SMC on Mac notebook computers/strong  strongIf the battery is nonremovable:/strong  ul liShut down your Mac./li liUnplug the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter from your computer./li liUsing the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds. If you have a 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch ID, the Touch ID button is also the power button./li liRelease all keys./li liReconnect the power adapter./li liPress the power button again to turn on your Mac./li /ul  strongReset the SMC on Mac desktop computers/strong  strongFollow these steps for iMac, Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Xserve./strong  ul liShut down your Mac./li liUnplug the power cord./li liWait 15 seconds./li liPlug the power cord back in./li liWait five seconds, then press the power button to turn on your Mac./li /ul  Then I would recommend using tools like strongSMC Fan Control/strong or strongiStat Menus/strong to control your fans and check memory and power usage.  Sorry if I don't answer your question in Spanish (I'm Latin American), but I think that we can't write answers in anything but English.  <comment346929> What apps are you running -= this looks like a bug in one of them - When working temperature increases and fan turns on so I would just worry about the panic <comment347119> Thanks for your answer, I'll try what you suggest and I'll tell you how it was.
