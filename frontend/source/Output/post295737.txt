Home button assembly can be seen through the front panel glass on iPhone 7+ <body> A couple of days ago I found some strange lines on my iPhone 7+. When sliding my finger over it I cannot feel any surface roughness. I think it's the Home button assembly that can be seen through the glass. I have had my phone since December 2016 and haven't noticed anything for a long time.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tMKkv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Has anyone experienced anything similar? Home button works great (for now), but I'm just curious what can it be.
