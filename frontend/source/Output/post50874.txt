Change webcam settings <body> I am using Skype and have noticed that the tint is kind of strange and the contrast is sort of off.  How do I change the settings for the MacBook Pro's built-in webcam?    <answer50878> According to this Apple discussion forum post:     As you know, software always controls your iSight. Most apps,   including all Apple apps of which I am aware, strongautomatically make the   iSight settings for you and do NOT allow you to manipulate them from   within the application/strong.      In my own case, I have found that merely adding more light to my work   room has allowed the automatic settings to give me adequate iSight   images.      However, strongif you want to take manual control, the iGlasses2 add-on   lets you manipulate many of the features that iSight/strong (and many other   compatible webcams) offer. strongNote that iGlasses2 may not work with   every applications that can work with your camera./strong      You can get iGlasses2 here: http://www.ecamm.com/mac/iglasses/   This Apple KB also offers some troubleshooting guidance:     Important: strongFollow these instructions in order.

Built-in iSight cameras These steps are for iSight cameras that are   built into a computer, such as the iMac G5 (iSight) or later, the   MacBook, or MacBook Pro.      ol   listrongSee if the issue is application-specific./strong Try another application (iSight works with applications like iChat, PhotoBooth,   and iMovie HD 6) to see if the iSight camera exhibits the same   behavior in all applications.

In short, you can try adding an app to offer access to the controls or do a bit of troubleshooting on you MBP to confirm if this issue occurs on other applications or for other users. Worst case, bring your MBP in for servicing.  strongNote/strong: Fixed typo.  <answer144214> There is also 'Webcam Settings' https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/webcam-settings/id533696630?mt=12 for a quarter of the price. I don't know how they compare on feature set, but it's been useful to me over the years.  <comment58279> Is it only in Skype that you have problems, or is there also a strange tint/contrast when using the webcam in other apps?
