Trashing .Trash and Emptying Trash <body> I don't want to sound stupid, but what happens if someone were to delete the code.Trash/code folder using Finder and emptied it.  I know it's possible unless there is something that just stops it from happening.  ol licodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall finder/code can be used to show the folder./li liThen go to code~//code in finder and delete code.Trash/code./li liOpen trash from dock then empty it./li /ol  What would happen?  <answer170069> Quick answer, strongnothing happens/strong.   If you delete it, code.Trash/code will be created again once needed. You can delete it without issues, no matter if you delete from Finder or from command line (coderm/code) will back again.  <comment199914> Don't you just love a self-healing OS? ;)
