JBL Soundfly Air with multi-router AirPort Express WiFi <body> I got my hands on a JBL Soundfly, but it shows some trouble when I connect it to my home WiFi, which consists of 2 first generation AirPort Express linked by a cable to create a shared network.  The AirPorts are set to 802.11n only (2.4 GHz).  When I stream music from my iPhone via Airplay the connection gets disrupted a lot (noticeable audio gaps).  When I attach another WiFi-Router to the network, and connect the Soundfly to that AP, it plays without problem.  Does anyone have the Soundfly running in a similar AirPort Express network and does not experience any problem?  <answer111950> Turns out the JBL Soundfly officially only supports code802.11b/g/code according to this document (page 3).  This leaves me wondering why it apparently worked with the code802.11n/code network, or whether that was a problem with my test. But now it has been working for a few minutes without any problems.
