Stuck with unwanted advertisements in-game <body> Whilst playing Angry Birds with my grandson, an ad for another game kept appearing. Despite trying to close this ad several times, I now find myself stuck with this game app on screen inviting me to download.   All other 'buttons', features, refresh, etc are inactive. How do I escape from this app and return to the wanted game?  <answer122675> You can force the app to close and then reopen it:  precode 1. Double-click the Home button.  2. Swipe left or right until you have located the app you wish to close.  3. Swipe the app's preview up to close it. /code/pre  Now reopen the app from the Home screen and you should be set.  Pro Tip: Sometimes tapping excessively with an app can cause it to slow down, freeze or lock up like you describe.  <answer122797> If other force-quit solutions don't do anything, try the old-school way:  ol liPress and hold the lock/sleep button until "slide to power off" appears./li liPress and hold the home button until the application quits and returns to the home screen./li /ol  If that doesn't work, then you're going to have to force-shutdown the iOS device:  ol liPress and hold both the lock/sleep button and the home button until your iOS device turns off./li liRelease the buttons, and the Apple logo will appear./li /ol
