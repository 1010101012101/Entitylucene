ipod touch 4g is unable to play music on docking station <body> I am not sure how to word this or even if there is an answer. I have a iPod Touch 4th generation that I upgraded to 5.1.1 last week. Since then I have not been able to play tunes through my docking station. It 'sees' the song and I can see the play count but there is no volume/song heard.   I can put my daughters 2nd generation iPod Touch on and it works fine so I know it isn't the docking station that is the problem.  Anyone know how to fix this?  <answer80798> We had the same problem but found it wouldn't work when the iPod had its cover on,  as soon as we removed the cover it worked fine. Hope this helps  <answer80806> Do you have the Dock adapter, the one that goes into the docking station that makes the dock fits iPod?  It could very likely be a connection problem, I had the same problem before.
