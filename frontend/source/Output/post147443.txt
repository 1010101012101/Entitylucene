Java is eating up 300% of my CPU <body> Can anyone help me find the cause behind java taking up 300+% of my CPU? I've shut down almost every app and am still having trouble trying to locate the cause.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l8eom.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer153362> Ian C. put me on the right track. I checked out the items that were running in Java by using the Open Files &amp; Ports tab on the process.  This lead me to ElasticSearch running on my machine. So I removed that and now it looks to be running without overheating again. Yay!  <answer265280> For me it was Cassandra using java. It took me a couple of hours to figure this out. I used:   strongps -A |grep java/strong  ... And there were a huge list with processes using java. I saw "Cassandra" so many times that I decided to stop that process with brew. Once you stop the process that is using java, your CPU will work fine.  strongbrew services stop cassandra/strong  Maybe you installed Java lately to use some other program? It might be that program causing this error.  <comment173810> Let's start by getting a better view. Knowing the parent process may help diagnose it. Doudble click on the java process and post the screen shot of the info window. Also...CrashPlan is a java application. I'm betting that's the culprit. <comment173820> CrashPlan will keep running even if you Quit it! run this in Terminal to confirm "ps auxww | grep -i CrashPlanService" <comment173822> I found this article how to get the crashplan and Java under control. http://www.chainsawonatireswing.com/2012/04/08/how-to-use-crashplan-but-keep-the-java-process-from-constantly-using-ridiculous-amounts-of-ram/ <comment173830> I also gave you answer how to reset the crashplan (which I would recommend) but the community found it premature and a wild guess, so I removed it for peace sake. <comment180481> Thanks Buscar - I killed CrashPlan with: `sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist` and made sure it was dead with: `ps auxww | grep -i CrashPlanService` and it's no longer running, but when I try to kill java with: `killall -KILL java` Java just restarts and is still running over 100% CPU. <comment180482> Ian C. here's a screenshot of the process ... http://shot.taylor.kiwi.nz/image/2n382V0T0N0g
