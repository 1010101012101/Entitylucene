How do I set an iCloud e-mail? <body> When I first got my iPod I was given the option to set up an iCloud address. At the time I didn't want one; however, I want one now. So, how do I get one now?  <answer143204> If you go to strongSettings/strong  strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong  strongAdd Account/strong, then choose strongiCloud/strong. At the bottom of the next screen you'll see strongGet a Free Apple ID/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBNWQ.jpg" alt=""  <comment168637> Perhaps try: Settings  iCloud for a start.
