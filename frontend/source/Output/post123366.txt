AppleScript or Automator workflow to clean orphaned files on Kindle <body> I'm wondering if there's a way to clean orphaned files from a Kindle using AppleScript or Automator.  It would basically look for any .sdr folder that doesn't have a matching .mobi or .azw and then move it to the trash.  Thanks!  <answer123476> If the .mobi and .azw files are directly under the .sdr folders, try running a command like this in Terminal:  precodecd /containing/folder;for d in *.sdr;do ls "$d"|grep -Eq '\.(mobi|awz)$'||echo rm -r "$d";done /code/pre  Remove codeecho/code to actually delete the folders.
