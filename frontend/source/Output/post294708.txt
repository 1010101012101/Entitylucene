My screen saver no longer shows pictures from albums <body> My screen saver no longer shows pictures from albums - it says there are no photos but they are there. It will show single pictures and the default directories.  <comment371979> Are your photos in the photos app, or in some other folder? Are the albums sub-folders within a central folder? <comment371986> The photos are in an album in the photos app, and the album appears in the "photos library" selection - they are not in a subfolder.
