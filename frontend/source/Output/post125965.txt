Unable to format / erase hard drive <body> I have an external HD that died on me a while ago and I'm trying to see if I can format / erase it to start using it again.  The disk does not show up in Finder but I can see it in Disk Utility. When I try to erase it from there I get  precodeDisk Erase failed with the error: POSIX reports: The operation couldn’t be completed. Cannot allocate memory /code/pre  When I try to verify the volume:  precodediskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk2 Error starting filesystem verification for disk2: Unrecognized filesystem (-9958) /code/pre  I've tried running a surface scan in Techtools Pro, it processed 650 blocks and all were bad. I cancelled the operation cause it was very slow.  codeDiskutil info /dev/disk2/code tells me:  precodeDevice Identifier:        disk2    Device Node:              /dev/disk2    Part Of Whole:            disk2    Device / Media Name:      WD Ext HDD 1021 Media     Volume Name:                  Escaped with Unicode:          Mounted:                  No     File System:              None     Partition Type:           None    Bootable:                 Not bootable    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 USB    SMART Status:             Not Supported     Total Size:               2.0 TB (2000396746752 Bytes) (exactly 3907024896 512-Byte-Blocks)    Volume Free Space:        Not Applicable     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no filesystem)    Ejectable:                Yes     Whole:                    Yes    Internal:                 No    OS 9 Drivers:             No    Low Level Format:         Not Supported /code/pre  I've also tried:  precodediskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Stef2TB /dev/disk2 Started erase on disk2 Unmounting disk Creating partition map Waiting for disks to reappear Formatting disk2s2 as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with name Stef2TB Error: -9944: File system formatter failed /code/pre  Can I salvage this drive somehow or is it ready for the trash?  <answer125974> Before trashing it try this:   In disk utility Under the Volume Scheme heading set the number of partitions from the drop down menu to one. Click on the Options button, set the partition scheme to GUID then click on the OK button.   Set the format type to Mac OS Extended (Journaled.)   Click on the Partition button and wait until the process has completed.  Next step:   Select the volume you just created (this is the sub-entry under the drive entry) from the left side list.   Click on the Erase tab in the DU main window.   Set the format type to Mac OS Extended (Journaled.)   Click on the Security button, check the button for Zero Data and click on OK to return to the Erase window. Click on the Erase button.   The format process can take up to several hours depending upon the drive size  <answer182147> I was having exactly the same problem as described above; unable to reformat my 16GB USB after interrupting an "erase free space" command. This worked http://www.macissues.com/2014/04/05/how-to-fix-deep-formatting-problems-with-os-x-drives/ The instructions are clear &amp; simple, no Terminal experience required. The command will force a reformat--of course any data will be lost, but your drive will be usable. EDIT: After doing this, my pendrive wouldn't mount but was detected by Disk Utility. I simply selected it and formatted it and voila! It mounts and works!  <answer222654> I found this worked perfectly (from the terminal):  precodediskutil eraseVolume ExFAT MyName diskX /code/pre  You'll need to change diskX to whatever the number is for your drive. You can find that out in disk utility, select the drive, click info, and look under 'BSD device node'  <answer225061> Before you trash your drive, it is also worth restarting the mac.  Sounds simple, but first boot after an OS upgrade or with a failed disk mount due to timing problems, and the system can get confused.  A reboot sorts this out. Happened to me: disk utility couldn't erase or reformat, tried all of the above, including macissues' bash script for overwriting the disk in terminal, multiple unplug/plug-in for the drive.... to no avail. Started the mac, and all was well: reformatted and on its way.  <answer236492> I found that this worked for a USB drive to erase and format it as HFS+ with journaling.  precodesudo diskutil eraseDisk  JHFS+ 'My disk name' diskX /code/pre  Where X is a number.   First run codesudo diskutil list/code to find the relevant disk3, etc - check the size and make sure it's the right disk!  <answer263177> The only solution for me was to format this USB drive on Windows. Also, the Quick Format didn't seem to work, I had to performa a standard format who took very long.  I don't understand what happened to the drive to be honest, I never had any error when formatting until now  <answer266233> On the left hand side of your finder, check the list of devices that are mounted. There may be more than one disk mounted. Eject all the mounted ones except for the one that you have to format. Now go to disk utility, select external hard drive and erase. This should work.  <comment147501> When I try to create the partition I get "Partition failed with the error:File system formatter failed". When I try again I get "POSIX reports: The operation couldn’t be completed. Cannot allocate memory". Any other options? <comment147503> I was trying to avoid this, but it does look like trashing is the option. <comment147505> Ah well we tried. Thanks for your advise. <comment167985> Did you find the answer in the end? Im having the exact same issue.. <comment168009> @stef one last option would be to remove the drive from the enclosure, disconnect it from the SATA interface, and then attach to diff. SATA bus (whether on hub, or SATA to USB cable). Would take some effort, but if the data is valuable enough and not backed up, it may be worth trying. Still, in all likelihood, it's mechanical failure of the drive head and not a problem with the SATA connection. <comment216726> Hi Jaans, while this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
