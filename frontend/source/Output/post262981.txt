Forgot iCloud pw on two connected iPhones <body> I have 2 iPhones that are both connected to find my phone. I just updated the old phone and it wants the pw for iCloud. I can't find what it is and have tried my iTunes pw with no results. I don't know what the iCloud pw is on my current iPhone. I checked the saved pw and it was not there.  How do I find the lost pw on both phones without losing everything on both phones?
