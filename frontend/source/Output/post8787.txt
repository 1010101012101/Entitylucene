Swap key €->$ permanently <body> I have a Macbook Air with a Swedish keyboard and when I type kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd I get this: strong€/strong. What I would like to get is strong$/strong ,now at kbdAlt/kbd+kbd4/kbd.   How can I swap these two around?  <answer8788> You could try Ukelele that allows you to edit key mappings for free.  <comment9352> For more information about how to use Ukelele, see this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2767/decimal-comma-in-spanish-keyboard-layout/2768#2768
