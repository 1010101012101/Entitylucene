Download songs from iTunes to iPhone <body> When trying to download songs from iTunes to my iPhone, a message pops up saying I have to delete and sync. Will this delete all my photos, contacts, and apps from my phone? Or just the music part of my iPhone?  <answer72711> Go to the iTunes preferences then the devices tab and tick the box about automatic syncing.  <comment84421> More detail please.  What do you do to cause this message to appear?  Are you using iTunes on the computer or the iPhone? <comment84422> I am using iTunes on the computer. and what I am doing is I click the sync music button on iTunes and the message appears saying to delete and sync in order to get the music onto my iPhone. <comment84454> How does this prevent the "Delete and sync" warning from appearing?
