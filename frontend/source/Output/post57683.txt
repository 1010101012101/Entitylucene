Full expression friendly calculator app? <body> One of the apps I miss most from Linux when using a Mac is the Gnome calculator (gcalctool). I like that I can type out a full expression before evaluating it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BgwXo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a good free calculator app that works similarly or is there a way to install gcalctool?  <answer57685> gcalctool is available in MacPorts  ol liDownload and install MacPorts /li liPerform the following action to install gcalctool from within a Terminal:  codesudo port install gcalctool/code /li /ol  <answer57697> I am lucky enough to have a Mathematica license, but if I didn't, I would solve problems like this using Spotlight or bc.  ol liClick on the Spotlight icon in the upper right and enter your math problem rather than a string to search for.  2+8*6^.5  immediately returns 21.595 . . . /li lithe bc app in the terminal works similarly, though I have found bugs in it and it wouldn't be my first choice./li /ol  <comment66327> I love Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 3 <comment66424> It's not free, nor quite the same as gcalctool, but I recommend at least taking a look at [Soulver](http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) for the Mac; best calculator app ever. :)
