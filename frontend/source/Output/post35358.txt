How can I delete an individual photo from my photostream? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do you erase pictures from the Photo Stream album on an iPhone running iOS 5?       Either on my Mac, or on iPhone or iPad, how can I delete an individual image from my photostream? I can't seem to work this out...  <answer35363> At the moment you can't. My guess is it will be included in the next iOS update though.  <comment42248> @Daniel - you are right - I didn't find those questions when I looked. I will vote to close as well. Thanks.
