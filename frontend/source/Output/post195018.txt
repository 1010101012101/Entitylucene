How to use previous iTunes icon? <body> I'm have a MacBook Pro (x86_64) with OS X 10.8.5 (fully patched). When I got the MBP, the iTunes icon was a cool blue icon.  Recently, Apple changed it to red. The psychologist tell us red indicates anger, defiance and hostility, and its a bad color. Its why USAir changed their color scheme from the shades of red to shades of grey. I did not like red, but I did not feel compelled to move.  I got updates this week (July, 2015), and Apple changed the icon again:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3zyf7.png" alt="enter image description here"  I despise that cartoony look, and now I am compelled to move. That cartoony look is one of the reason I have held back from OS X 10.9 upgrade for my personal equipment (and even one of the reasons to abstain from iOS upgrades). This is a personal preference, and I understand only a subset of folks feel the same way.  I've been through iTunes preferences, but I don't see a way to change the icons.  How do I change the iTunes icons? Or how do I use the previous, blue icon?  hr  Related, other reasons to abstain from the upgrade includes all the untested features and broken features that got added to 10.9. emQuod erat demonstrandum/em: iCloud Keychain and CVE-2015-1065. My keychain was never at risk through this vector, and it was a conscious decision to avoid the risk.  <answer195024> There are many ways to do this. Here are a few...  IMO The best way is to replace the actual emAppName.icns/em file with the one from the older version, in this case it's: code/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/Resources/iTunes.icns/code  Select the application bundle and control-click em(right-click)/em  strongShow Package Contents/strong, then navigate to the emAppName.icns/em file shown in the pathname above.  Note:  After replacing the emAppName.icns/em file one may need to run codekillall Finder/code in a strongTerminal/strong to force the updated emAppName.icns/em file to show properly everywhere.  If it's not showing properly in the strongDock/strong afterwards run codekillall Dock/code in a strongTerminal/strong.  Another way is to paste an image into the App's Info Sheet after selecting its icon at the top left of the Info Sheet.  Select the application bundle then control-click em(right-click)/em  Get Info or kbd âŒ˜ /kbd-kbdI/kbd.  Or use a third-party app that can assign an new emimage/icon/em to the application bundle.  <comment232747> Does Apple make the past icons available? If not, where do I get the old blue icon that Apple probably claims a copyright or trademark over? <comment232748> `/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/Resources/iTunes.icns` - that's kind of a neat trick, but kind of scary too. That means code signing can be bypassed for the package. More correctly, its a lack of semantic authentication. Lack of semantic authentication was one of the causes of Android's [Master Key](https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Forristal-Android-One-Root-to-Own-Them-All-Slides.pdf) flaw. It was even a problem back in the 1990s, with [SSLv2 and SSLv3](https://www.schneier.com/paper-ssl-revised.pdf). Its too bad we are not learning from our mistakes.... <comment232749> I routinely replace application bundle _.icns_ files, using scripts I've written, for many application that I do not like the icons for whatever the reason and have never had any problem afterwards running those applications.  So I'd have to say _code signing_ either doesn't come into play at this level or it's broken.  Now I'm not redistributing anything, this is just for use on my own system. <comment232751> As to getting old _AppName.icns_ files, I get them from the Apps themselves either from a copy I have running in a virtual machine or if need be download one of the OS Updates or Application Updates (where applicable) and extract them from the _package_.  The latter method is kind of a waste of bandwidth so it just depends on how much you dislike the new icon as to what length you'll go.
