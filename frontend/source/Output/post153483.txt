Pen-drive (USB thumb drive ) not showing up on Mac Desktop <body> I recently updated to Yosemite, now my pen-drive (USB flash drive) isn't working on my Mac. iPhone is working fine but pen-drive gets detected in disk utility but it is not showing up on the Desktop. I did format the pen-drive several times from Disk Utility but it didn't show up in the desktop...from the FINDER on top of the screen, then to preference I did marked on the "external drives" but still not working.... What to do???  <comment180681> We need more information, and the question needs to be clarified.  The fourth sentence of your question and onward is incomprehensible.  Can you access the disk via the menubar while in Finder or in the "Devices" sidebar category in a Finder window?
