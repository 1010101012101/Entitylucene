preventing ssh command from opening xquartz on every session <body> Whenever I use ssh, after I type the password, xQuartz pop ups in the dock and terminal window looses focus. This happens even if there's no an X session. Why? How to prevent this behavior?  <answer91667> Solved by myself. XQuartz installation added a custom configuration for ssh in codeetc/ssh_config/code. I have just removed codeForwardX11 yes/code and ssh won't open XQuartz anymore.  <comment107651> Just to clarify - forwarding the X ports over requires using the -X switch within ssh. You want to use the switch in order to use xQuartz within the ssh session, yet retain the focus on the terminal window until you actually do so? <comment107654> I just want a normal command line access, not x window session. I didn't use -X. For example: `ssh user@server.local` <comment107655> Odd. Is there any alias or anything that may be mapped to your ssh command? <comment107656> I don't think. There is nothing that I added to ssh in .profile or .bashrc. <comment107661> Do you have anything in your ~/.ssh/config file that may trigger the use of X11? eg, the `ForwardX11` option would do it. <comment107662> @mjturner I don't have a config file in that folder. There are just a few RSA keys and the known hosts. <comment107668> I think i found the config in `etc/ssh_config`, the last uncommented lines are: `ForwardX11 yes Host * XAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth`
