Errors publishing from Calendar app to WebDAV Share on same machine <body> I am currently attempting to publish a calendar in OS X 10.8. The calendar is a local "On My Mac" calendar residing within iCal/Calendar on the Mac. The same Mac has Server app installed. I have configured the Server app with a single File Share (named "webcal"), which is provisioned to share over WebDAV only. I have also setup Open Directory and created a user account to access this WebDAV share.  As a test, I opened up codeFinder &gt; Connect to Server/code. Using the credentials, I successfully was able to mount codehttps://localhost/webcal/code and read/write to the share. However, when I attempt to publish into this share directly from iCal/Calendar, I receive the following error message:  precodeThe calendar “Untitled” couldn’t be published. http://kitchenipad@localhost/webcal/Untitled.ics is not a location that supports this request. /code/pre  By checking in Console I was able to locate the following corresponding entry:  precode7/10/13 1:27:28.186 PM Calendar[6311]: Validation error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=1570 "publication is a required value." UserInfo={     CalManagedObjectType = CalManagedPublicationError;     NSLocalizedDescription = "publication is a required value.";     NSValidationErrorKey = publication;     NSValidationErrorObject = "&lt;CalManagedPublicationError: 0x7fbcbd70cee0&gt; (entity: PublicationError; id: 0x7fbcbd7dfab0 &lt;x-coredata://60115C98-1B7D-4B6F-B812-690F22C8374C/PublicationError/p45&gt; ; data: {\n    code = 405;\n    domain = CoreDAVHTTPStatusErrorDomain;\n    publication = nil;\n    userInfo = nil;\n})"; } /code/pre  Due to the project I'm working on I will need to have WebDAV and iCal client working on the same physical system. I'd like to avoid having to virtualize the server as well. Does anyone have a clue as to why this might not be working?  <answer96708> Any reason why you don't just turn on the Calendar service in the Server app and navigate to code"http://yourdomain.local/webcal"/code?
