How do I cancel 'word is finishing analyzing your document' on MacBook pro? <body> Word has apparently been 'finishing analyzing' my document (not that I asked it to) for a good 30 minutes now. Had been working on it for ages without saving and really really can't afford to lose it. The cancel option suggested (Command + . ) does nothing.  Please help me
