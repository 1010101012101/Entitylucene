Problems while installing Python 3 on El Capitan <body> I'm using codehomebrew/code as my package manager. While installing codepython3/code with codebrew install python3/code I am getting the following error  precodeclass RegexFlag(enum.IntFlag): AttributeError: module 'enum' has no attribute 'IntFlag' /code/pre  I've tried the steps outlined in homebrew Troubleshooting but the problem still exists. Any pointers would be helpful.  <answer267206> Once you have determined that it's not a codehomebrew/code problem using their troubleshooting guide my first suspicion would be that you are picking up the wrong version of the codeenum/code module. Make sure you are not setting codePYTHONPATH/code anywhere (codeecho $PYTHONPATH/code at the command line will tell you) and try again.  The other possibility I would check is that you are running the right version of Python. codewhich python/code should return code/usr/bin/python/code (the version Apple installs), if not then you might want to check your PATH shell variable and temporarily set it to something else.   <comment335136> Which version of macOS and Xcode are you using? <comment335139> I am using El Capitan and Xcode 8.2 <comment337182> should the PYTHONPATH point to python 3.x or 2.x ? I read it's recommended to say cmd 'python3' with python 3.x  and cmd 'python' with python 2.x <comment337795> I can't make a recommendation on this because I use the Anaconda install of Python, not the home-brew one. I have PYTHONPATH pointing only to PyObjC so that it is picked up but nothing else from the Apple install of Python.  ` export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/PyObjC" ` <comment339252> Why should `which python` point to the system Python? What if it points to a version installed via Homebrew? What is the correct way to install Python 3.x alongside the 2.x Homebrew version in this case? <comment339350> The person asking the question had installed python3 with homebrew. Therefore, for the sake of the system, `python` should be python 2, the system one.   If you're installing python 2 and 3 with homebrew then `which python` should point to the homebrew python 2 and python3 should point to python 3. <comment339410> Hmm, but even when I have Homebrew Python 2, and `python` pointing to it, I get this error. (Btw you forgot the @slhck, just came here again by accident.) <comment339696> Not sure if you ever solved this issue. I reported it here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/9229 <comment339880> not quite solved it,i had to reinstall a fresh copy of el capitan again <comment339881> @TonyWilliams everything was ok,no `PYTHONPATH` and am using a right version of python2 `/usr/local/bin/python` of which i know this is not the cause of the problem.NOTE, i have a new installation of el capitan and repeated the python 2 & 3 installation and everything worked fine. i still  have the previous installation of which i still can't figure out why the problem occurred with it since the steps of installation a 100% same!
