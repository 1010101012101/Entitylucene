Creating a Windows Virtual Machine in VMware Fusion from Bootable USB <body> I have the Windows 10 setup in a bootable USB drive. I would like to create a virtual machine from it on my Mac computer.  I have already tried to create a .cdr image from the USB drive using disk utility. However, when I tried to create and run a virtual machine from it, I always got an "Operative System not found" error.  What should I do?
