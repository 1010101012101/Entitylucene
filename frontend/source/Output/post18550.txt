Is there an AppleScript or Automator action to quickly edit Info for Video in iTunes? <body> I ripped the DVD set of a television series to my iMac. But now, the filenames are weird and there is no meta info.   In Automator, I see there is an action to edit Info for a song. That's great, but it doesn't really work for TV Shows - it won't handle the stuff that you'd see in the "Video" tab when viewing Info in iTunes.  Is there an Automator action for this that I can use? If not, AppleScript?  <answer18557> If your files are MP4s, you can use MetaX for this.  <answer56638> It's possible on iTunes, here's a example  precodetell application "iTunes"     repeat with i in (get selection)         tell i             set episode number to 1             set episode ID to "blah"             set season number to 1             set show to "blah"         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment20294> If you could add any insight to this question, it would be helpful: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6982/alternatives-to-metax <comment29203> Would [iTag](http://www.itagsoftware.com/compatibility.php) work for you?
