Dual login Windows and OSX on an Apple computer (not dual boot) <body> A couple years ago I was using the business center of an Embassy Suites hotel. They had Apple computers with a dual login screen where I could choose to login to Windows or OSX. This was not a dual boot setup. It was choose at login. I have not been able to find a system that does this.  Do you know of such a system that makes this possible? Again, this is for a dual login, not a dual boot configuration.  <answer206198> It's not possible unless Parallels Coherence is used. Parallels runs Windows Apps in Mac. Find out more here -- http://kb.parallels.com/en/4670  <answer206200> I suspect it was a dual boot set up. This can be done via refit and would show a screen like this  You then get taken to the Windows or OS X login - but for both of these you can make this auto login so the process does not stop here and you go in as a user. In OS X probably as the guest user and I think this can be done on windows as well  <answer212649> I found the exact system. It was enabled by Boot Runner.  <comment248582> The environment as I witnessed it segregated the operating systems. It was not Parallels. <comment248583> This sounds more like it. Maybe it was a dual boot and the login step as you describe it sounds like what I saw. <comment248585> At that screen, if you were to select Windows, you would see the entire boot process and 'starting windows' screen etc... right? <comment248588> What user name and password did it ask for? <comment248590> If I recall correctly, it was more about how much money you paid to get minutes on the computer not a username and password. It was like 20 bucks for 10 minutes or something ridiculous like that. The reason I ask about this at all is because I'm trying to decide how to best equip an Apple computer lab for multi purpose computing.
