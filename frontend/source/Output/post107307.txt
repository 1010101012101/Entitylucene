How can I install the Command Line Tools completely from the command line? <body> I'd like to script the installation of the the Xcode Command Line Tools.  On Mavericks,  precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  will open a dialog prompting the user to install, but I'd like to trigger the install without the dialog, like using the codesoftwareupdate/code command.  Is there a way to do this?  strongEdit:/strong  Specifically, codexcode-select --install/code launches an application that downloads and installs the tools without requiring the user to manually download them or have an Apple Developer account. It appears to use code/System/Library/CoreServices/Install Command Line Developer Tools.app/code to do this.  I would like to use the same mechanism that Apple is, but without the GUI. I do not want to have to manually download the .dmg containing the tools as this seems fragile. Apple provides several other command-line tools, like codesoftwareupdate/code and codeinstall/code that download or install software directly from Apple, and I'm looking to find the same for this type of distribution.  <answer107314> ol liDownload the Command Line Tools package from the Apple Developer site./li liMount the downloadedsup1/sup DMG:  precodehdiutil attach "command_line_tools_os_x_mountain_lion_for_xcode__october_2013.dmg" /code/pre/li liRun the installer via the command line:  precodecd "/Volumes/Command Line Tools (Mountain Lion)" installer -verbose -pkg "Command Line Tools (Mountain Lion).mkpg" -target / /code/pre/li liWhen finished, unmount the DMG and delete the download.  ol liEject the DMGsup2/sup.  precodecd / hdiutil detach /dev/disk3s2 /code/pre/li liDelete the DMG.  precoderm "command_line_tools_os_x_mountain_lion_for_xcode__october_2013.dmg" /code/pre/li /ol/li /ol  supsup1/sup At the time of writing, the downloaded DMG and package name is accurate, however in the future, the name may change.

The reason I ask is because the developer tools require a (free) developer account to access and distributing them outside of that would violate Apple's licensing agreement. <comment125875> @ColinC. xcode-select --install does not require an Apple Developer account. It may require the acceptance of the license agreement before the tools are used, but it downloads them without an account. <comment125877> I would like this to be future proof, and I don't want to have to provide my own copy of the tools disk image. xcode-select --install downloads and installs the tools for the user, and it doesn't require an ADC . I want to do exactly this, but without the GUI. <comment226048> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment226805> @grgarside: Took some time to update [this script](https://gist.github.com/trinitronx/6217746/revisions) with the latest Yosemite / XCode 6.3.2 CLT `dmg`, and copied essential parts of the answer locally to this answer. <comment226807> @grgarside: I realized the linking issue & that the script was probably out of date, but didn't have time to update it on the same day I initially posted.  I just wanted to give those links as a good place to start and as a note to self to go back and update & test things again. <comment258066> This script appears to be the original source for the code and has additional code that will work on versions of Mac OS X below 10.9: https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates/blob/ce8df8a7468faa7c5312444ece1b977c1b2f77a4/scripts/xcode-cli-tools.sh <comment271056> Found points 1 and 2 very useful for installing the Hardware IO Tools. <comment332003> This method doesn't work right on 10.12 Sierra; the touched file seems to flag for installation of an old version of the tools, which `softwareupdate` never recognizes as installed <comment332043> sadly it's pretty typical for this type of stuff to be broken every new release, so no real surprise..... <comment350452> For 10.12 (Sierra), all I had to change here was for "-v" to become "--verbose" <comment350479> thanks - updated the code in the answer since that should be backwards portable.
