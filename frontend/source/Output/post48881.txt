Best way to send Videos from the iPhone? <body> What is the best way to send a video from the iPhone to another iPhone or to a PC - Windows ?  I tried dropbox but it is really slow (probably because of my internet) .. BUMP doesnt send videos, and I tried itunes but it syncs to "Videos" .. I want the video to appear in the camera roll without the need of using iFile from cydia.  Any ideas ?  Regards.  <answer49393> If you have a jailbroken device, you can use AirBlue Sharing to send videos over Bluetooth - see here for the developer's description and here for a Lifehacker post about it.  <answer247669> If you are sharing to another iPhone within 10 feet, use the AirDrop feature, which is sent through Bluetooth. If not, select each photo and tap the up arrow in a box at the bottom left corner and choose mail.  <comment55968> this is about jailbreaking?
