Battery turned into X after Yosemite <body> After I installed Yosemite on my MacBook Air, the battery icon is just an X.  I have tried restarting the computer, and turning off the computer, then back on, but nothing is happening! Even the charger won't recognize that it is plugged in. This Mac is less than two years old, the battery should be fine.  <answer170245> The hardware that reads the battery health is independent of the OS running so it's just a coincidence that the X appeared with the update. I would get on the phone with AppleCare (or on the web or in a store) and see if they can run some remote diagnostics and tell you what precisely is happening with the battery.  You can also get many details from System Information:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uoTGa.png" alt="System Information - Power"  However, these snapshot values aren't as good as the tools and manufacturing data that Apple has on specific batteries, models and usage patterns. Basically, once you have the X - the battery will need to be replaced sooner rather than later whether it's two months old or two years old.  <answer170249> There is a circuit board on the battery it self that reports it presence and status to the OS X.  In OS X there is a piece of hardware run by firmware called System Management Controller (SMC) that takes that information and process it. Sometimes the SMC gets confused and needs to be reset following instructions from Apple.  You can also look up your Battery information in the About This Mac, to see what it says.  h3What could cause the display of the X?/h3  The circuit mounted on the battery it self, could have malfunctioned. Normally it will reserve a minimum charge for it self and not allow the battery to drain beyond that point. But, if the battery was drained to the levels that the build in circuit can no longer function it will not report the status and ask to be charged. If you were Installing Yosemite you should have gotten a warning that you are on battery, if ignored the battery could have been drained completely.   So what can you do other then SMC reset or bringing it in for repair? You can try the coconut app to see if it does something. http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/  <answer171040> Ok, so I found out how to fix the battery. You need to power off the computer, hold emShift+Control+Option+Power (at the same time)/em for a couple of seconds, then turn the computer back on. When you do that, the X should be gone! :)  <answer223904> i did it by banging my laptop with my hand , it worked seriously , trust me.  <comment200271> Excellent explanation. Shows an extra downside to running on battery power during an upgrade. <comment200272> how do you turn the battery off and back on? <comment200452> So - I'm curious what your System Profiler shows for the battery health? Could you post that as a comment to my answer? (like charge remaining, cycle count and the voltage)
