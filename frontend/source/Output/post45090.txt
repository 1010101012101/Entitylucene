Cut functionality shortcut for folders and files <body> I'm accustomed to kbdctrl/kbd+kbdx/kbd, kbdctrl/kbd+kbdv/kbd combination to move files and folders using only the keyboard. Can I get the same functionality on OS X Lion?  <answer45093> Yes, but it's a little different in Lion.  In both the strongmove/strong and the strongcopy/strong situation, you use kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdC/kbd to put a file on the clipboard.  When pasting:  ul liTo strongcopy/strong the file to the new location, press kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdV/kbd.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Masii.png" alt=""/li liTo strongmove/strong the file to the new location, press kbd⌥ Option/kbdkbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdV/kbd.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oJgFx.png" alt=""/li /ul  <answer45153> You could use kbdcmd /kbd+kbdx/kbd too : if I'm not mistaken, cut exists in Mac OS since the 10.4.8 version, it's just disable.   To get the combination kbdcmd /kbd+kbdx/kbd working, you could just enable it, by opening a terminal and run this command :  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AllowCutForItems 1 /code/pre  You could re-disable it, by changing the final "1" to "0".  strongEDIT/strong :   I didn't try this trick for a while, so it appears that it's not working under Lion (It's was working on leopard for me).   Anyway jtbandes's solution is the best way to do cut and paste :)   <comment51370> The only problem is it doesn’t actually cut the files; it just copies them.
