How can I tether a phone for Personal Hotspot and use my Bluetooth Headset at the same time? <body> I'm attempting to tether an Android phone via Bluetooth (PAN), while using my Bluetooth headset (Jawbone Icon HD).  When the Android phone is connected, the iPhone 5s refuses to connect to the Jawbone, saying it is not in range.  It also refuses to connect to my car's stereo when connected to my Android via Bluetooth.  The Android works great when tethered over Bluetooth, and only sees the PAN profile.  How can I resolve this issue?
