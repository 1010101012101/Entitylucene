Is there an iOS wallpaper similar to Nexus Revamped? <body> This is Nexus Revamped. Basically, it creates particles on the screen when users touch it.  I want to make an animated wallpaper: a kaleidoscope that spins when the user swipes on the screen.  <comment241664> If you want to make this a software-recommendation, please edit it to show you're looking to jailbreak and run existing mods. If it's really about API/SDK/coding - then SO is the place for this question. <comment241704> Unfortunately, it's not possible with iOS. <comment241805> @RedEagle2000 thanks by the way, but I want to know why, and how? <comment241806> Apple doesn't open up wallpaper access to developers, it may change in the future, but for now you just can't.
