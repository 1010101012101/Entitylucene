A program like skype with auto answer for IOS? <body> I have build a robot with a head actually made of an ipod ( with IOS6). I would like to take control of the camera remotely so i can control the robot from afar.  The program i need is very much like skype BUT i need to automatically activate the call as the robot is unattended.  - the camera should not be activated all the time - unlike most camera program, it has to be like a skype call (video and sound both ways)  Skype allows you to do that but ONLY on desktop version!   I have searched for such a program/functionality and didn't find anything. i am actually thinking of adding one servomotor to answer the calls on the screen... ridiculous.  Ideally this program should work on my ipod with IOS 6 but a solution on ios 8 or even android interest me aswell as a backupsolution  any idea?  <answer217267> So i found another program that do almost everything and that is "usable" in my case ( skype is not ) : babyphone3g.  up:  ol liit has the auto answer feature./li lithe camera can be turned off when not used./li liIf the connection is bad, it offers me to take pictures/li /ol  down:  ol livideo is only one way (big down) but sound can be both ways/li lithe "babything" design which make it look unapropriate for me when it is the best i found./li liNot free ( and probably pay for each separate device you want to connect, have to check that)/li /ol  I am not sure i should answer my question or edit my question in that case...  <comment262646> i found another program that do almost everything but still not everything:
