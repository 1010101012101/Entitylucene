Time Capsule stuck on makingbackup disk available <body> I am an IT person, and i have set up two Time capsule and the backup is not working. It just stays stuck. I can use the TC as a file server, no problem. I have tried everything, fixing the backups, erasing the disk, creating the backups again, checking updates...  This ahappened on two separate locations. Same problems.  I can provide with some console but there is not much going on.  Many thanks  <answer30638> It had happened to me in the past and I fixed it by rebooting the Time Capsule.  <answer31029> Fixed by changing the mac names and TC abem to shorter names.. After 48 H it worked  <comment35598> Without more details it could definitively be anything. Can you add relevant entries both from the Mac and the TC logs? <comment35617> I finally got it sorted. I changed to shorter names for computers and TC. I left in despair and it worked after 48 hours.... I love Apple but i will not recommend TC for backup anymore on Wifi.
