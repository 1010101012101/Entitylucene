Outlook 2016 - show sent messages in conversation list on the left <body> I use the conversation view so I can keep track of threads, but it's confusing not seeing my own replies in the list. Is there a way to get it to show my replies by default?   I can see my replies if I click a thread and then click the kbdConversation/kbd arrow shaped button. But what I want is to see my replies in the thread list on the left by default.  <answer217124> I have the same problem in Outlook 2011 for Mac; I think strongthis configuration is not possible./strong   As shown in the following links from the MS documentation, it looks like the option exists for the Windows version, but it is not available in the Mac OS X version. As you alluded to, (your own) sent messages appear in in "reading pane" but do not render in the message list.  strongOne workaround is to automatically BCC yourself on everything/strong. Enable this by strongOutlook/strong menu - strongPreferences.../strong - strongEmail/strong section - strongComposing/strong - strongFormat and account/strong section - enable "When sending messages, automatically BCC myself." This will have the effect of putting a copy of messages you send into your Inbox, so they will render in the conversation view/pane. I'm not sure if this will result in duplicate messages rendering in the "reading pane" for conversations. I'm personally not willing to do this, but it should/does work.  Until or unless...  ul liI'm missing something, or /li liI learn some fancy keyboard shortcut or other UI trick, or/li liGive up my convictions and BCC myself on everything (which emdoes/em render properly),/li /ul  this interface (and its inconsistency) is unusable. Back to Apple Mail for me.  <answer250675> I had the same problem with my PC when I upgraded Outlook.  I was able to resolve it by going to File/Account Settings and then changing by default email account, rebooting and then changing it back and rebooting.  All works fine in both Inboxes!  <answer264413> Try:  File: Options: Mail - check "Enable preview for Rights protected emails"  <answer283153> Go to accounts settings and check the box Use Cached Exchange Mode, close outlook and reopen  <comment331392> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.
