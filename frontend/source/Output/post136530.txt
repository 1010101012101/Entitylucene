What are the ways to solve my iPhone power drainage problem? <body> I am using iPhone 5s with iOS 7.1.1  I have a problem from 3 days ago. The battery keeps draining and the phone keeps warm in the whole day.  I found that mstreamd keeps starting every minute. From some online communities, it seems like the source of the problem. Their solution is to JB it and remove mstreamd, but I don't want to do so.  Steps to reproduce the symptom:  precode1. I don't know /code/pre  Steps I have tried:  precode1. reboot 2. reset the iPhone 3. Disable iCloud 4. Disable photostream sync and syncing over Wifi /code/pre  All can't help.  How to solve this? Thanks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wzk45.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Reference:  http://forums.macrumors.com/archive/index.php/t-1716660.html http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/28n3vn/solved_crazy_battery_drain_may_apply_to_other/  <comment161964> 1) "From some online communities" -- it would be helpful to cite where. 2) **Disable photostream sync and syncing over Wifi [to your computer]** Is there an improvement? 3) General note, follow [this user tip](https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-7071) I posted over at ASC <comment161965> thanks. Post updated. <comment161966> What type of battery life were you getting before 3 days ago vs now? Anything you've changed before 3 days ago vs now? <comment161968> drop ~25% after 8 hours vs drop 100% after 8 hours. Not much difference in terms of usage. <comment161991> Could you look sorted by the CPU time, to see who is actually using it for long time. The mstream is a drop in a bucket.
