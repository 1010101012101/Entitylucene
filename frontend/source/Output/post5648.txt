Group running apps in OSX? <body> Since I'm working on several projects that require different resources (shells, files, chrome windows, etc), I'd like to organize them better.  Is there a mac utility or something that will allow me to group a bunch of app windows together to represent a specific task?    For instance I can group chrome window, finder window, shell into one group (this would be one project), and then a bunch of those into another group, etc.  Thanks  <answer5649> An out-of-the-box possibility would be to use Spaces to define applications to go to a specific screen on launch, and navigate between Spaces (Virtual Desktops) as a whole.  Note, however, that you will have a conflict if you want the Finder to be in two places at once :). Your only option is one specific Space, or globally across all Spaces.  <answer5657> As @VxJasonxV wrote, Spaces is the solution.  If you want a bigger sandbox, you could probably run a dozen VMs if you had a desktop with 32GB or so of RAM. I think you'll need a license for each VM.  <comment5836> I'm confused by the perceived limitation. I have finders in two spaces... <comment5855> It can only automatically open on one Space. You can of course, open a new window *afterwards* and drag it into the new Space. My point was that it will only be automatically on one, or all Spaces. <comment5857> I'm sure there's a third party app that can manage window groups efficiently, I just don't know of any by name. <comment5876> I started using spaces, and it works for the most part.  I just have to move apps there manually, and also the dock is obviously shared.  I need something that sandboxes groups of apps tighter. <comment5882> right clicking on finder (on dock) - open new window opens it in the current space. <comment5883> Ah, didn't know about that. It generally satisfies my point, "new finder window", but being able to do it when you're already on the new Space is handy. Thanks! <comment138447> I would really like this also. The ability to hide/show groups of windows without having to hide all the other windows. Spaces assumes you want to switch all the active windows rather than working on a subset. And this is at the window level, not the app level. I might have some chrome windows in project 1 and some chrome windows in project 2.
