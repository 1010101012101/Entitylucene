Set time restrictions for certain websites even on admin <body> Is there a way to set time restrictions per day on certain websites like YouTube on my own admin account?  (preferably free)  I tried the application SelfControl , but there aren't many options, and I have to set it every time I want to block websites.   If nothing, what other tips are there to limit myself from distracting websites?   <answer226482> If you visit YouTube or other time-consuming sites with your web browser you can install either WasteNoTime (Safari or Google) or LeechBlock (FireFox). WasteNoTime is/was inspired by LeechBlock.  The extension (I only tested it in Chrome) is adequately adjustable by using blacklists and whitelists.  By adding emchrome://extensions/em to the block list you can even hinder yourself disabling or uninstalling the extension.   These extensions are not infallible though: you can still just remove it using the Finder.  <answer226758> Try Freedom service. It has nice free features as well as extended paid ones.  <comment275014> Did you try [WasteNoTime](http://www.bumblebeesystems.com/wastenotime/) already? <comment275015> No, thanks, I haven't heard of that one. I will check it out.
