iOS 10 Proactive App Suggestions are Missing <body> Now that I've upgraded my iPhone SE to iOS 10 (version 10.0.2), the proactive app suggestions are gone.  What I mean by emproactive app suggestions/em: in iOS 9, when I'd plug in my headphones or connect a bluetooth speaker, a small gray app icon would appear in the lower left of the lock screen or, in the app switcher, a gray app suggestion tab would appear along the bottom of the screen. This would usually be exactly the app I'd want to start using on my iPhone.  The proactive app suggestions feature was very handy. I wish it still existed in iOS 10. Is there a way to turn it back on?  <answer257295> I've figured out how to re-enable the proactive app suggestions in iOS 10:  ul liGo to strongSettings/strong → strongGeneral/strong → strongSpotlight Search/strong/li liTurn off the top three options:  ul liemSiri Suggestions/em/li liemSuggestions in Search/em/li liemSuggestions in Look Up/em/li /ul/li liGo back to the main strongSettings/strong menu./li liClose the strongSettings/strong app (go to the Home Screen)./li liLock the phone (turn off the screen by quickly pressing and releasing the Sleep/Wake button)./li liUnlock the phone./li liGo back to strongSettings/strong → strongGeneral/strong → strongSpotlight Search/strong/li liTurn emon/em the three options you turned off above./li liLock the phone (turn off the screen)./li /ul  Now, when I plug in headphones or connect a bluetooth speaker, the proactive app suggestions show up as they did in iOS 9!  I found the basics of this procedure in the comments at this reddit discussion.  <answer273230> The answer provided by jefe2000 is only partially correct.    To receive the Proactive App Suggestions in the bottom left corner of the lock screen, in the App Switcher and in Spotlight, the following are strongrequired/strong.  ol liFrequent Locations in strongSettings/strong  strongPrivacy/strong  strongLocation Services/strong  strongSystem Services/strong  strongFrequent Locations/strong is turned on./li liThe Siri App Suggestions widget is enabled./li liSiri Suggestions in strongSettings/strong  strongGeneral/strong  strongSpotlight Search/strong is turned on./li /ol  The following are strongrecommended/strong for better predictions:  ol liWiFi on. /li liBluetooth on./li liLocation Services on./li liLocation-based Alerts strongSettings/strong  strongPrivacy/strong  strongLocation Services/strong  strongSystem Services/strong is on./li /ol  I wrote this code so this is how I know.
