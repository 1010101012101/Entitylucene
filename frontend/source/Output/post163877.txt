How to open new Safari window on primary display <body> I am using a monitor as my second display for my MacBook Air. I have Netflix fullscreen on my second display. Whenever I want a Safari window on my primary display, I have to go to the second display, create a new window, and drag it over to my primary display. this disrupts Netflix, as I have to click to leave full screen then put it back to fullscreen.  Is there an easier way to achieve this?  <answer163878> "active" the primary display and run this applescript  precodetell application "Safari"     make new document at end of documents with properties {URL:"about:black"}     activate end tell /code/pre  <comment191961> This works, although the menubar cuts off a few pixels of Safari's top bar.
