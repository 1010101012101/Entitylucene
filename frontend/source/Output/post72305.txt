Message notification does not work in iPhone 4S <body> My iPhone 4S always showed a notification in banner (that is, the top of the iPhone screen) when a new message/mail came to me. Those notifications can be viewed in any state(Means, Even if I am playing a game or I am seeing some other apps, I can see the notification in the banner if a new message came).   But, the problem that I faced is, nowadays, it doesn't show the notifications on the banner. If a new message appears, it just show the notification on Messages app icon with the corresponding badge value. Also, I opened the notification screen (by swiping from the top of the screen), the notification appears.   The problem is, it does not show the new message alert in the banner. I attached my Messages app's notification settings here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hhisd.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aogMd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Did I miss something?
