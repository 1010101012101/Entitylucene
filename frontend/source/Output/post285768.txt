Config git so it'll work on both xcode and terminal <body> Origin question in SO  Summarize the original question:  I've 2 accounts in bitbucket and want to use both of them in bot xcode and terminal. I tried setup ~/.ssh/config, so it worked in terminal with a specific custom hostname codeHost bitbucket-myAccount2/code. But xcode couldn't understand the host codebitbucket-myAccount2/code, so it couldn't do the work (pull, push...) with that host. How do I config so xcode work with that?  ==========================  So, after a while struggle with this, I've removed the ~/.ssh/config content. Therefore, xcode's git works as expected. However, git terminal no longer works: coderepository access denied./code  How do I config so the terminal can work with this origin? (no customize in ~/.ssh/config)
