How can I change the name listed on my iCloud emails I send out? <body> I have already changed in settings on my phone (iPhone) and when logging in on computer next to my picture in iCloud top right, it reads the name I want.  I am divorced and do not like my prior last name showing up when I email people. How can I change this?  <comment216727> are you saying that you changed it but its still showing up as the name you dont want?
