Trouble in Automator's Shell Script after OS X 10.9 Mavericks upgrade <body> I've got a problem. I use from lot of time an Automator's shell script:    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codecat &gt;&gt; ~/Dropbox/ClipBoard/Appunti\ Mac\ del\ $(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d).txt /code/pre  It ever worked but, after Mavericks upgrade, it return an error while running: "ambiguous redirect (1)". Trouble should be depending from date's code, because using  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codecat &gt;&gt; ~/Dropbox/ClipBoard/Appunti\ Test.txt /code/pre  it runs correctly. I tried modifying code or adding some quotes, for example  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codecat &gt;&gt; ~/Dropbox/ClipBoard/Appunti\ Mac\ del\ $ (date “%Y-%m-%d”).txt /code/pre  but the trouble persists. How can I correct it?  <answer111592> I think you were close and that the following should work:  precodecat &gt;&gt; ~/Dropbox/ClipBoard/Appunti\ Mac\ del\ $ (date "+%Y-%m-%d").txt /code/pre  You had smart quotes in your sample and that won't work and you left out the plus in the quoted format string which you had included in your original.  <comment126538> If you paste the command from Automator directly into Terminal, does it work? <comment126539> no, same trouble... <comment126540> Does http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2462385/getting-an-ambiguous-redirect-error help? <comment126542> I made some tests but it didn't solved... <comment126551> Possibly related to the `date` command in Mavericks: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107839/parsing-dates-in-mavericks <comment126555> yes, probably that's the trouble but I can't find a way to modify code to make it works... <comment131341> no, it doesn't work.. <comment149915> What does `~/Dropbox/ClipBoard/Appunti\ Mac\ del\ $(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d).txt` print in Terminal? <comment150208> "No such file or directory", it can't exist!
