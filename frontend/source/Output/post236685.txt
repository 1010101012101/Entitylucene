make "fit to screen" default window size in Quicktime <body> How can I make Quicktime to always open in Fit to Screen option (available at View-Fit to Screen)? It doesn't seem to remember the last window size.  Is it possible to attach a script to a program, so that every time the program launches, the attached script executes? In my case, it would change the window size to Fit to Screen  <answer236701> strongQuickTime Player/strong doesn't have a strongPreferences.../strong emmenu command/em like other applications do, nor does it have a emcom.apple.quicktime.plist/em file to manipulate. Therefore there isn't anything you can do directly, however here is a workaround of sorts.  Note that this workaround requires changing the emdefault/em application for emfile types/em, e.g. em.mov/em, you'd normally open directly with strongQuickTime Player/strong to the application created herein, called: strongQTP Fit to Screen.app/strong  Using strongAutomator/strong create a new emApplication/em and add a strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em.  Change: strongPass input: [to stdin]/strong emto/em strong[as argument]/strong  Add the following emcode/em:  precodeif [[ ! -z $1 ]]; then      open -a "QuickTime Player" "$1"      osascript -e 'tell application "QuickTime Player" to activate' \               -e 'delay 1' \               -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "3" using command down' \               -e 'tell application "QuickTime Player" to play front document' fi /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KE6Yz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Save it as an emApplication/em named: strongQTP Fit to Screen/strong  In order for strongQTP Fit to Screen/strong to be the emglobal default app/em for, e.g. em.mov/em, files you'd open in QuickTime Player you'll have to use the strongDefault Apps/strong Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode to change which application opens a given Extension.  Install strongRCDefaultApp/strong and then in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongDefault Apps/strong select the strongExtensions/strong tab and scroll down to strongemmov/em/strong and then change the strongDefault Application:/strong emto/em: strongQTP Fit to Screen/strong  Now then you double-click em.mov/em files in strongFinder/strong or accessing them from strongSpotlight/strong the strongQTP Fit to Screen/strong application will open the target file in strongQuick Time Player/strong, set strongView/strong to strongFit to Screen/strong and start playing the file.  Note: If you do not want it to automatically start playing the file then remove the line of emcode/em, the one that has "play front document" in it.  If you need modify other emdefault/em methods of file types, Apps, URLs, UTIs, etc. the strongDefault Apps/strong Preference Pane, RCDefaultApp by Rubicode, is a great utility for it.  To make the strongQTP Fit to Screen.app/strong application bundle look better in the Applications folder you can copy and paste the strongQuickTime Player.app/strong application icon from its strongGet Info/strong emsheet/em to the icon of the strongGet Info/strong emsheet/em for strongQTP Fit to Screen.app/strong.  hr  Note: I added the codeif/code emstatement/em to the emcode/em so the strongQTP Fit to Screen/strong application doesn't error out when executed by itself.  In other words, double-clicking it will essentially do nothing, whereas without it will throw a couple of error messages.  <comment289750> Don't know if you had already looked at my answer however I wanted to let you know that I've updated it a couple of times so you may want to look at it again if you had already looked earlier. <comment289762> daaaamn, Apple really doesnt like QTPlayer. Thank you, kind sir!
