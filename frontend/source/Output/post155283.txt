How do I add media not in iPhoto to a Keynote presentation <body> I want to use folders other than codeIPHOTO/code and codePHOTOBOOTH/code when adding media in codeiWork/code applications.  For example when using Keynote, this pops up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHkRe.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How do I add folders to the pop-over meniu?  <answer155325> You can   ul lidrag them in from a Finder window/li licopy and paste from somewhere else/li lior use Insert  Choose.../li /ul  EDIT: you can also add the folders by dragging them into the media browser, as this article describes.     First, in your iWork program, make sure the tab of the Media Browser that you’d like to modify is selected, then switch to the Finder. Find the folder you’d like to add, and start dragging it. Now press Command-Tab—while still dragging the folder—and switch to your iWork application. When the iWork program becomes active, your floating palettes will show up, and you can then drop the dragged folder into the Media Browser. (You can do the same thing using Exposé instead of Command-Tab, if you prefer.)      To remove folders you’ve added, Control-click on the folder in the Media Browser and select Remove Folder from the pop-up menu. You can only remove top-level folders, not folders within folders, in this manner. To get rid of all the folders you’ve added, Control-click on the Folders folder, and select Remove Folders from the pop-up menu.   <comment182709> But I want the convince of using the pop-over to navigate to where I keep my images. Isn't there really a solution for this? <comment182711> It's possible, you have to drag the folders inside the popup, like in [this](http://www.macworld.com/article/1134187/mediafolders.html) tutorial (the last paragraph). <comment182721> Please update your answer with that link and I'll accept it, thanks! <comment182722> I added the link.
