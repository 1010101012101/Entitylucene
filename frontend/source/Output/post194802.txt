Get rid of the "Instruments wants permission to analyze" prompt, from command line, in Yosemite <body> In our jenkins build automation environment we have several OSX nodes, now all updated to Yosemite, where we run ios simulator tests.  The problem is that on any newly introduced node simulator tests cannot run without further ado since instruments keeps prompting "Instruments wants permission to analyze other processes. Type your password to allow this."  I've tried all the hints I could find, e.g. at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9476131/is-there-a-way-to-remove-the-authorization-prompt-from-command-line-instances-of, like  precode1) DevToolsSecurity --enable  2) security authorizationdb write system.privilege.taskport allow  3) security authorizationdb write system.privilege.taskport is-developer  4) Other settings like /code/pre  code&lt;key&gt;allow-root&lt;/key&gt;  &lt;true/&gt; &lt;!--instead of false&gt;/code  code&lt;key&gt;authenticate-user&lt;/key&gt;  &lt;false/&gt; &lt;!--instead of true&gt;/code  code&lt;key&gt;class&lt;/key&gt;  &lt;string&gt;allow&lt;/string&gt; &lt;!--instead of user&gt;/code  precode5) sudo security authorize -u [username] /code/pre  Also I've made certain the [username] is in _developer group.  codedsmemberutil checkmembership -U "[username]" -G "_developer"  =&gt; user is a member of the group/code  Combination of 1) and 2 seems to have done the trick earlier, in Mavericks. Any hint of what command line will do the trick in Yosemite will be very much appreciated!
