How do you get ipod nano to display the watch face as the default view <body> Is there way to set the watch face as the default display?  I wear the iPod Nano as a wrist watch and I would like it display the watch face first when I press the power button.   Note: I'm asking this question here mostly because I found this form post so comically high with noise vs signal.  <answer51577> Settings  General  DateTime  Time on Wake (Set this to on)  Thanks comically high signal to noise post!
