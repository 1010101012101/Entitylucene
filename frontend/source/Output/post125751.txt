Can't get WiFi Payloads to iPad using Apple Configurator <body> I have 400 iPads I need to prep and am having a couple issues. I was hoping somebody could give me a bit of advice..  strongQuestion/strong  ul liHow can I verify the WiFi payloads are copied to the iPad?/li /ul  strongBackground/strong  ul liApple Configurator 1.5/li liI received a backup config from the customer/li liI also received their settings in case the restore didn’t work./li liOf the settings I’m concentrating on two to verify the restore worked, or a manual config and prepare worked. Those are verifying an app was installed, and wifi payloads./li liWhen I restore using the supplied *.iosdevicebackup file neither the app or the wifi settings are on the iPad/li liI configured iTunes for the customers account - downloaded the app - imported into the Apps tab of the Configurator program and now get that loaded, but I can’t confirm the wifi payloads./li lihave 3 wifi payloads configured in the setup tab - wifi section. 2 are for the customers wifi and the 3rd is for our in-house wifi just for sanity’s sake. Each are configured with ssid and WPA / password, but when the IPad is restarted after the prepare I would assume I would see all 3 networks and the iPad would connect to our in-house network automatically as it's the only one available. But I only see a list of available networks, and I’m asked for a password when I try to connect to our in-house one. I thought that was what the payload was for./li liI also tried making a profile and setting the wifi payloads up there, same result./li liI’ve been speaking with the local apple store, and while polite and professional, not much help../li liWhen I try to do a manual prepare my settings - Restore value is Don't resort backup. If I have that set to the backup I received I get an error when trying to customize the device at the end of the update./li liI also tried only 1 wifi payload, our in-house WiFi. Same results. I'm asked for a login / password when I try to connect./li /ul  <answer144931> The WiFi networks were mixed case which caused the confusion and problems.  <comment147189> this can be closed.
