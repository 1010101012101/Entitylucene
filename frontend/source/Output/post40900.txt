What are some alternatives to the Mac App Store? <body> I am just curious, what are some alternatives to the Mac App Store? Basically, I want something that will update my applications. Since the Mac App Store doesn't do this with applications not purchased from the Mac App Store, I need something else. In addition, I would also like to be able to browse apps.  <answer40904> If you want an app-based app store alternative, then try Bodega.  It's a pretty good app that allows user to download/buy apps that existed before the app store did.  However, if that's not enough, you can always use different websites such as www.macupdate.com, www.iusethis.com etc.  <comment46313> Alternative regarding what? Easy payment? User ratings? Featured apps? Ability to download Mac apps in general? Native app to browse applications? Integrated automatic updates? License and re-download management? Audited, signed, and sandboxed apps? <comment46337> @Thilo Thanks. See my updated question. <comment46338> I've tried Bodega, and love it, until now. Everything works in it except the browser. I can't browse apps at all, even after reinstalling it. <comment46381> Hmm... it works perfectly on mine.  If Bodega isn't working, you can use AppFresh, though you can only update apps and not really browser apps. <comment46382> Are you using Lion? <comment46383> Yep, but there shouldn't be any difference to it as it's the same app.  Have you tried checking if the website's blocked by your firewall or your router? <comment46385> How do I know what I'm looking for? I know how to check both, but I don't know what I'm looking for. <comment46404> You can use apps that tests apps outgoing connection, like Little Snitch/Hands Off. I've tested it myself and it only uses the website appbodega.com, amazonaws.com and the sites where bodega gets the apps information from their respective sites.
