writeOrDie2.0.8.dmg will not open to install <body> I just downloaded this cool app called "Write Or Die 2" for the Mac (and I made sure I downloaded the Mac version).  Disappointingly, when I click it to install, it just flashes the image of the icon for a short second and then fades, leaving no windows and no comments from the system.  I'm really excited to use this, and I bought it, but I can't get it to even install.  It's downloaded, so that's not the problem.  The problem is that it won't open to install.  I e-mailed the creator of this app to ask, but he hasn't responded yet.  Also, I try to take a screen shot of the icon flashing for you, but it's just too quick.  Any ideas that can help me out?  I'd very, very much appreciate it!   <comment251007> What format is the installer in?
