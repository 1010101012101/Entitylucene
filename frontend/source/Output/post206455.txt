Iphone 5c software update just loads? <body> hi i have an Iphone 5c and works great but the issue is i try to update my phone but it will stay at the loading part for a long time and wont load. how do i fix this problem?  <answer206458> I had this same problem a few days ago. It kept me on the phone with tech support with my internet service for 2 hours, It's a problem with Apple's servers. My advice would be to restart your iPhone frequently and keep trying to update it. Eventually, it work, just keep trying because iOS 9 is worth the extra effort.
