cdto (to open a terminal) does not work in Mavericks <body> I've just switched to the Mavericks operating system in my Mac. I used to utilize a quite nice app called "cdto" that serves to open a terminal at the current directory where Finder is. The point is that now "cdto" does not seem to work with Mavericks. Before I used to utilize "OpenTerminalHere" but it is now obsolete.  Anyone with the same problem and any solution?  <answer110552> I haven't had any issues with it since upgrading to Mavericks. What version are you using and what happens when you open it?  The latest, strong2.5/strong (signed for Gatekeeper compatibility), appears to work. You can download it here: https://code.google.com/p/cdto/downloads/detail?name=cdto_2.5_sign.zip  <answer110553> I think I was doing something wrong. It is necessary to hold on the command key before dragging the app to the Finder toolbar. Thanks for the help.  <answer110554> Please download the latest version at : https://github.com/jbtule/cdto/releases  strongNote:/strong on Marvericks, you need to hold down the Command Key to drag the codecdto.app/code into the toolbar.
