How to change fn key function? <body> Currently, my Fn key toggles mission control. I am looking all through system settings, and I can't find a way to stop the fn key from toggling mission control. Does anyone know how to do this?  <answer275434> Open the Mission Control system preference  Change the hot key for Mission Control.   By default it is Control up arrow.   <comment346502> Thank you so much! I was looking in the keyboard settings instead. <comment346503> No worries. I went there first to check too, @LionMac
