What's the name of the iOS / OS X calculator app that has 'variables' functionality? <body> I'm looking for an app on the App Store but I forgot its name.  It is a calculator app that looks like it has been written on a noteblock.  You can store the solutions of calculations as quasi-variables and then reuse them later on.  I know it's available for the Mac and all iOS devices.  Does anyone know what app this is?  <answer43756> This sounds like the app Soulver which is available on Mac OS X and iOS.  It allows you to use a mixture of natural language and spreadsheet/calculator functions to perform easily readable equations.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kJmgT.png" alt="Soulver"  <answer43864> This sounds like it could be Numi, which describes itself as follows:     Numi is a little calculator, that lives in your menu bar. It magically   combines calculations with text, and allows you to share computations   with other Numi users.   <answer93969> Try this one as well http://www.swiftcalc-mac.com It has variables and can calculate many expressions at once  <comment49929> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment50019> The link could disappear, and even it it was still there say next year, you are requiring the user to leave the site to view the answer, which is a poor user experience.  Links are great, but you should summarise them also.  I have amended your post for an example of how to do it.  You can see the full changes in the edit history.
