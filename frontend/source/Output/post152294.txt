Shell environment variables not available in GUI apps even if app launched via Command Line <body> It is expected that shell environment variables won't be available in GUI apps launched via codeSpotlight/code or codeFinder.app/code.   But until Mavericks - I could launch an app via Command line such as:  precodeopen -a IntelliJ\ IDEA\ 11 /code/pre  And Intellij will inherit the environment variables defined in shell (In my case zsh). This does not seem to work properly anymore. I have seen similar problem, when I launch codeEmacs.app/code from command line.

I want GUI app to inherit variables that were defined at the point, the app was launched from command line.  <answer152299> You can try something like this:  precodelaunchctl setenv VARIABLE VALUE open -a IntelliJ\ IDEA\ 11 launchctl unsetenv VARIABLE /code/pre  This will pass environment variable codeVARIABLE/code into the launched app and later it will be cleaned, but will remain in the app.  <comment271869> Doesn't work in El Capitan. :(
