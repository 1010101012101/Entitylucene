folder icon preview lags <body> My father is a photographer and he uses late 2015 iMac (8Gb memory, 3,3 Ghz processor) to store and adjust his photographs.   He has this problem with viewing folders - icon preview takes forever to load, and sometimes doesn't even load after a minute or more.   This takes place only when viewing huge folders 150+ Gb, 3000+ photographs.  Is there a way to make this iMac show all icons as preview and run smoothly or the only solution is to split huge folders into smaller ones?
