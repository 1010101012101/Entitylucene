ping command does not lookup the reverse DNS hostname <body> why on OSX the ping command does not lookup the reverse address of the hostname? see this:  precode&gt; ping -c1 www.google.com PING www.google.com (216.58.208.36): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 216.58.208.36: icmp_seq=0 ttl=53 time=165.662 ms  --- www.google.com ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 165.662/165.662/165.662/0.000 ms /code/pre  it have an option on man page:   precode -n      Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses. /code/pre   but seems that the default behaviour it's -n.  can anyone explain this?
