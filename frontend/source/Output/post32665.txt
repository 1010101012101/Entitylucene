Growl Notifications for a Twitter List? <body> I am currently using Twitter.  I would like to receive growl notifications for a particular twitter list. However it seems like the current preferences allow notification on a all/none basis.  Do we have an alternative app that offers such an option?  Otherwise I will just create another twitter account and use that for growl.  <answer32679> Tweetdeck is the app you're looking for! It comes with his own growl-like notifications and I use it over a year now. It's just great!  <comment37367> Does Tweetdock also push all already read mentions and messages on every startup? I really hate that about the original twitter app. <comment37368> Nope, once mentioned, Tweetdeck will consider them as 'read' and won't push them! <comment37370> Great news! The Twitter.app really sucks ever since Twitter got hold of it :-( <comment37394> Did it work? :) <comment37401> Yes. Behaves as expected! I just hope they'll integrate growl notifications in the future. <comment37402> What I enjoy especially is being able to choose a specific location for the **trends**. Tweetdeck also shows the **explanations** to the trends. <comment37408> Ok, great. So your question is solved? Or do you have any more questions? <comment37410> My question is solved =)
