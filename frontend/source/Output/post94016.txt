Register a Macbook <body> I'm trying to register an old macbook in apple support profile (https://supportprofile.apple.com), but I don't have any idea about which is the bought date.  I didn't bought it in apple store, but in some paraguay shop, so, I don't even know if this date is set.  Is there a way that I can use to register it via OSX, or a way to find my purchase date?  Thanks in advance
