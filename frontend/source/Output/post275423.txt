iPad Air2, IOS 10.1: Why won't backspace/Delete Key "repeat"? <body> iPad Air2, IOS 10.1, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Roboform. With cursor at the end of a line of text, pressing the backspace/Delete Key deletes 1 or 2 or 3 letters (seems random) and then stops. I then have to tap the key repeatedly to delete one letter at a time until the whole line is empty.  "Key Repeat" is selected in Settings and Preferences.  This is the case with all keyboards; Google, Swift Key, Apple, etc. Annoying and tedious.  Can someone explain and/or fix this for me?  <comment346482> The first thing I would recommend is to update to the latest version of iOS (10.2.1) and try again.  I have an iPad Air 2, also, and it works fine for me with all my keyboards in all the apps I've tried.
