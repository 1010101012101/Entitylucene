iOS 10 Mail - Threaded emails automatically expand with entire thread in each of them <body> If I have a long threaded conversation, and receive a new email, I'd expect every email of a thread to only contain the new email. What happens instead is that at first glance it does appear like this, but in 2-3 seconds the email expands fully having the whole thread in each of the individual emails of the thread.  Interestingly if I change the setting to see the most recent email on top, then it works, but I do not want the most recent email on top, so why do I have to scroll through the entire thread with every new email...?
