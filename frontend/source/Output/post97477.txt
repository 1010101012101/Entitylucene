can't connect to wireless printer <body> I have an Epson Workforce 845 printer. I have it setup on my wireless network correctly. I can print to it without any trouble from a couple different windows computers but I only have intermittent success on my mac. Usually when I go to print in the print queue it will say "Looking for printer." then "The printer is not connected."  I have tried resetting the print system, reinstalling drivers from apple and epson. nothing works.  My printer is on a static ip 192.168.0.65. The network settings confirmation sheet printed by the printer confirms this. If I ping that address from my mac sometimes it is successful and sometimes it gives the error codeping: sendto: Host is down/code codeRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0/code. I'm no pro at the command line but I tried nmap -A 192.168.0.1/24 and this is the relevant section   precodeNmap scan report for 192.168.0.65 Host is up (0.031s latency).

Also after resetting the print system sometimes the printer doesn't show up in the add printer dialog.  EDIT:  When the printer stops working for me and I try to open the Epson Printer Utility it won't open. Even though everyone else can still print and I was able to print when I tried 15 minutes prior. Even though it says it can't find the printer, in System Preferences I can see the printer switch from "Idle" to "In Use" and vice versa.  Can anyone help me out with a fix or a way to diagnose what's wrong? Thanks!  <comment114374> Does it print over USB ? Also how (as what) does it show up in your wifi scan ? <comment114375> @Buscar웃 it prints fine over USB but ideally it needs to be wireless because many computers are using the same printer. What wifi scan are you talking about? <comment114379> So far it looks like it is not the printer driver. But was wondering about your network settings, still reading the protocol you published with printer sharing enabled. <comment114401> Is there another device on the network that might have that IP-number (either statically given or accidentially handed out with DHCP)? <comment114438> @ThorbjørnRavnAndersen no the printer is the only device with that ip address <comment114443> I had a similar problen with AirPrint ón an HP printer as configured by the official tool.  I changed the static IP address to be a dynamic one and it worked. <comment114506> → Devin: you can remove the `nmap` analysis because it doesn't help to analyze corectly a basic wireless problem. A `ping` is largly enough to show that your Mac doesn't reach your Epson printer. <comment114508> → Devin: could you include in your problem analysis all the IP involved, and a screen copy of the wireless network location used by your Mac. <comment114580> @danielAzuelos There are many devices on the network I'm not sure which ip addresses you want to know. Workstations are generally in the 192.168.0.200-299 range, ip phones are in the 100-199 range and peripherals are in the 50-99 range. Which wireless network dialog would be helpful for you to see? <comment114625> → Devin: all the IP adresses involved == the IP address of the Epson printer, the Mac failing and one of the computer accessing the printer. Of courses, provide the IP addresses on the wireless side. Since this information may help anyone wanting to help you, please include them in your initial description to replace the nmap output.
