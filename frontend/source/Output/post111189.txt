Is it possible to use VNC / ScreenShare OS X 10.9 Mavericks OSX Server 3.0.1 Local Network User <body> Quite simply, is it possible to use VNC (Windows) or ScreenShare (OS X) as a local network user?  All users are local network users and when I access the server via Screen Share VNC://LOCAL IP ADDRESS I am prompted for a username/password.
