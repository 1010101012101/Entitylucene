iPhone 4 stuck on black screen after Jailbreaking with Cydia <body> I have an iPhone 4, jailbroken, and running iOS 7.1.2. I opened the Cydia app, it appeared to be loading something so I waited. Then the screen turned black. I can still hear sounds such as the charging tone when you plug your iPhone in to your PC and things like that. A few posts have recommended doing some Lock Button and Home Button combo but my lock button is broken and doesn't work.  I can't seem to restore because Find My iPhone is enabled and I need to disable it to be able to restore.  Is there any way I can restore this phone and remove Cydia?  <answer150736> hold down the power and home button untill the apple logo apears this will take 15-20 sec   <answer177981> Try downloading redsn0w and creating a DFU mode IPSW. Restore the IPSW with iTunes. Now that your phone is in DFU mode, you can totally wipe the iPhone and restore.  You can download redsn0w here.  <answer186582> What I did was leave my phone on the charger for 10-15 minutes then I pressed my power button (my home button is broken) then my lock screen wallpaper showed up.  <answer194411> Download itools 3.1.9.5 English version you can google it. theresimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c9bm0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment177419> He already said the 'lock button' (power button?) was not working. So ... not so much. <comment231870> Welcome to Ask Different!
