How can I disable shift + control + scroll zoom in chrome? <body> I use kbd⌃ ctrl/kbd + kbd⇧ shift/kbd + kbd⇥ tab/kbd to move between tabs in Chrome, but if I scroll with the touchpad it'll zoom the page. This happens quite a lot and it's frustrating. Is there some way I can disable the kbd⌃ ctrl/kbd + kbd⇧ shift/kbd + kbdscroll/kbd shortcut?

In Chrome it is enough if you use two keys to switch tabs.  kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdtab/kbd  If however you prefer to modify the the Chrome shortcuts, visit this website  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shortcut-manager/mgjjeipcdnnjhgodgjpfkffcejoljijf  <comment103613> I'm using 3 keys because it performs a different function. shift+ control + tab goes backwards. <comment103614> The chrome extension you linked doesn't deal with combinations of mouse and keyboard as a shortcut, and doesn't solve the issue at all. <comment103666> I wasn't thanking you, what you wrote didn't solve the issue. Also this isn't an OS X hotkey function, it's specific to chrome. It would be helpful if you would  attempt your own suggestions before answering so it is at least relevant. <comment103677> Zooming is a OS X system-wide function and not directly related to Chrome. Do you want to disable it totally? <comment103679> @patrix It's not a system wide zoom. The system wide zoom is control + scroll. This only affects chrome, firefox and safari or any other application I try doesn't do it. It also only zooms the webpage, not the browser chrome or any such. <comment103680> @patrix I've recorded a video on what happens. <comment103770> Chrome does control what it wants to do when it detects user actions, this zooming feature doesn't come from OS X. If you look at the video I recorded you can clearly see it's not an OS X function. I've submitted this as a bug https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=230752 to chromium which they seem to think is a regression. I was not asking about creating shortcuts, I'm asking about removing one that is native to chrome. <comment103772> OK, let see what they come up with. <comment104262> I was looking for this too. This seems to happen on newer version of Chrome only. Previously, ctrl+shift+2finger scroll on trackpad did not trigger zooming. <comment105075> I also have this exact problem and am looking for a solution… Looks like we have a [bug](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=178972)
