In itunes (for windows) can you set podcast location on disk to a different location? <body> In itunes (latest for for windows) can you set podcast download location on disk to a different location that just the media folder set in preferences?  <answer45260> Unfortunately, not really.  While you can specify the location of the entire iTunes Library folder (in strongPreferences/strong, to to strongAdvanced/strong, and change the strongiTunes Media/strong location), you can't set a different directory for specific types of media, such as podcasts.
