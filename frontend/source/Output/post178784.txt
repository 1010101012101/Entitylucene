How to get non Hi-Res image in Skitch? <body> I have a Macbook Pro Retina.  When I capture an image in Skitch, it is always twice the size.  I shrink them back down via Preview for social media.    Is there some way to make Skitch capture in non Hi-Res mode?  Or is there a tool that can quickly reduce these images by 1/2?  <answer178798> There are a lot of re-sizing apps on the Mac App Store that will allow you to drag an image onto a Dock icon and such. "Resize This" was the first one I found via search.
