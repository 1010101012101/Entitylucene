Some USB devices work, some don't on Macbook <body> Some older USB devices such as flash drives or mice work on my Macbook 2007 model, but newer ones are not recognized. Any ideas about the diagnosis and the cure?  <comment94552> Could you be more precise? Which newer ones are not recognized? Can you provide some example (manufacturer, model)? <comment108606> Could it be a USB 2 vs. USB 3 issue? Macs only support USB 2.
