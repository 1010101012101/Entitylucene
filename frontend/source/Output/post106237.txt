How to find Hard Drive capacity in Mavericks? <body> I usually check the Hard Drive capacity in the Activity Monitor. But when I checked it, it literally looked different. I selected each tabs, trying to find the information about my disk but to no avail. How can I find the disk occupied in my hard drive?  <answer106244> You can check it via Finder. Just select the Hard Drive and press codeCMD + I/code.  Or   ol liClick on the Apple icon on the menu bar/li liSelect codeAbout This Mac/code, then click on codeMore Info/code./li liSelect Storage /li /ol  <answer140594> Sometimes a picture is worth many words:  Notice that the top words are TABS and then click on strongStorage/strong. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mGAUI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment125049> Thanks! I recommend the second solution!!! <comment165683> I hate that this was removed from activity monitor. It actually makes me want to switch operating systems, I loved being able to see it right there.
