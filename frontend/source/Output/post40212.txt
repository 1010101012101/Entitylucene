Cannot empty trash <body> I am trying to empty my trash, and it keeps giving me an error message that says,      .Trash can't be opened right now because it's being used by another task...     I have tried restarting my computer, running codeFinder/code  codeSecure Empty Trash/code everything yields the same result and error message from above.  <answer40213> Try running this command in Terminal:   precodesudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/* /code/pre  It should prompt you for your administrator password, but that should remove any files in the trash without any issues.  Good luck!  <answer40214> You can use codefuser/code to list the processes that have an open file:   precodeps -eal | grep $(fuser ~/.Trash) /code/pre  <answer40216> h1X LAB/h1  ...has a guide for troubleshooting trash problems in Mac OS X.  h2Files in use by other applications/h2  Use one or more of the following methods if you receive a message indicating that a file can neither be moved to the Trash, nor emptied  from the Trash, because it is "in use" by another application.  Quit the application that is using the file. This will usually permit  you to then move the file to the Trash or to empty the Trash. If you are  unsure of the application that has the file "in use", the Terminal  command codelsof/code can tell you the name of the process or application that  Mac OS X considers to be using the file, as follows:  ol liClick the Trash icon in the Dock to open a Finder window showing the contents of your Trash./li liOpen Terminal./li liAt the Terminal prompt type codelsof/code followed by a single space, but do not press Return yet./li liDrag and drop the file "in use" from the Trash to the Terminal window. The path to the file will appear after the codelsof/code command:  precodelsof /path_to_file /code/pre/li liPress Return. If the file is "in use" then the output from lsof will list the names of the applications or processes which claim to be using the file under the first column heading, COMMAND./li liIf the file is "in use" by an open application, Quit that application. If a background process has the file "in use," use Activity Monitor to terminate that process./li /ol  strongNote:/strong One must  be careful when terminating processes as certain background processes  are needed for Mac OS X. Quitting processes like loginwindow or  kernel_task could force you off your account, freeze your Mac, or  cause a kernel panic. If you do not know what effect quitting a  process may have, do not quit the process.  h2Empty and recreate an account's Trash/h2  ul liAffected account is admin:  precodesudo rm -ri ~/.Trash /code/pre/li liAffected account is user:  precodesudo rm -ri /Users/user_name/.Trash /code/pre/li /ul  Then log out and back in.  strongNote:/strong Assure you have typed the command exactly as specified before proceeding as emtypographical errors in this command can have dire consequences/em!  <answer40254> h1Trash It! (free)/h1  This AppleScript Application force-empties your Trash. Especially useful if you have files or folders in the Trash with permissions set incorrectly, locked Trash items, want to securely delete a stuck item, or trash items from other partitions.  <answer262110> To identify which task is using your Trash, you can use the following command:  precodelsof | grep Trash /code/pre  then quit or kill it by specifying PID from the second column, e.g.  precodekill PID /code/pre  supAdd code-9/code to forcibly kill it./sup  hr  Alternatively you can install emWhat's Keeping Me/em application which can identify and kill the processes which are blocking your Trash from being emtied.  As per site brief:     Have you ever have the problem where you can’t empty the Trash or eject a disk because something is preventing you? Usually the reason is because some application has a file open, and thus you can’t get rid of the disk or trash the file. That’s why we made What’s Keeping Me! What’s Keeping Me will identify the application that is holding the item open.   <comment109348> I had a similar issue where emptying the trash took... hours.... the sudo command did the trick. (long term solution was a fresh install of OSX)
