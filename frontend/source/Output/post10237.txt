I've managed to break my terminal, (iTerm2(b17), ZSH, OSX10.6.6) <body> I'm migrating to a shiny new laptop (yay) unfortunately I've manually set up my iTerm to match the old machine, but something is not right (not yay).  I'm experiencing  ul liusing codexterm-256color/code doesn't give the full colour set for say, vim./li liapplications like codevim/code dont clear out of the scrollback when exited./li limy kbd↖ home/kbd and kbd↘ end/kbd keys are completely broken and I can't seem to Google a solution/li limy kbd⌫ backspace/kbd key doesn't delete backwards, it adds a 'space' and prevents further input until code^C/code./li /ul  Here is my .zshrc and my .profile. I dont have an code.inputrc/code.  Here are my keyboard settings for iTerm2:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qpiCC.png" alt="screenshot20110315at801.png"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rhugJ.png" alt="screenshot20110315at801.png"  I'm fairly sure i've broken something between code$TERM/code, iTerm2's keyboard settings and my code.zshrc/code, but I'm simply not competent enough to debug it. As far as I can tell, my settings are identical to my old laptop, which works.  <answer10245> It turns out that xterm-256color does not work correctly unless you have xcode installed.  <comment23266> Apparently, the terminfo files for xterm-256color and several others are in the Xcode installer instead of the system installer for 10.6. You should find that in Mac OS X Lion 10.7 these files are installed with the system.
