"sudo apt-get install" on OS X Mavericks <body> My understanding is that you need to install 'Fink' before an apt-get will work in the Terminal on OS X, but there isn't a Fink binary installer yet for Mavericks.  Does anyone know what the best alternative would be for   precodesudo apt-get install  /code/pre  on OS X Mavericks?  <answer108305> If I understand correctly, you just want a package manager.  codeapt-get/code is just an interface for Aptitude, a codedeb/code packaging system. DEB isn't tied into Mac OS like it would be your average Linux distro, so you'd need an alternative.  Fink will do this on its own, other alternatives are codeMacPorts/code or codeHomebrew/code.  If your goal is to be able to execute a command, say like code(something) install program/code and it'll install the program and its dependencies for you, either of these three will do that for you.  I'd personally suggest Homebrew. http://brew.sh/  <answer108306> Fink has been released for OS X Mavericks. Per their latest news itemâ€¦     2013-10-30: strongfink-0.36.0 released./strongbr   codefink-0.36.0/code was released on 31 October, 2013. This is the first release to work with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). We are currently in the process of making packages available.   You can download Fink from fink.thetis.ig42.org.  <answer125513> Why you only need gcc? You can also use clang instead gcc. You just need to install (if available in Xcode) Command Line Developer Tools  <comment126993> Fink has been release for Mavericks <comment184766> the formulas aren't always there in brew though.  I wish there was a clearer "formula" for porting apt-get packages to brew
