I suggest creating a bootable [USB flashdrive install](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/how-to-make-your-own-bootable-os-x-10-11-el-capitan-usb-install-drive/) of OS X 10.11 and doing a clean install. <comment263498> It's usually never a good idea to run two malware applications on the same system. <comment263537> At first I upgraded from Yosemite. When I started having the problems with Finder I logged in through the Command-R and reinstalled El-Capitan <comment263580> Thanks. The problem existed before I downloaded and strated to use Malwarebytes. I will remove it however now that I cleaned the laptop.
