PDF reader that refreshes at updates and stays put <body> I am looking for a pdf reader which refreshes when the pdf is updated, strongwhile staying (roughly) at the same page it was before the refresh/strong.  Adobe and Foxit don't refresh. Preview does refresh, but gets you back to the first page after every refresh.  strongThe reason for all this:/strong I am using Texstudio to edit LaTex files. TexStudio has an internal pdf viewer which does exactly what I want (refreshing when I recompile the pdf, and staying roughly at the same position in the pdf). But Texstudio only allows you to open a emsingle/em pdf viewer window. I would want to open several to be able to look at the pdf output in different places at the same time (it would significantly improve my productivity).

In his comment, Jonathan wrote     For what it's worth, I've found Skim to be a good viewer that doesn't   have this issue. Just make sure to check "Check for file changes" in   the Sync section of Preferences.   which neatly answers my question.  <comment273711> Closely related and possible duplicate question  [Reopen PDF in Preview on the same page when modified externally](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/167917/reopen-pdf-in-preview-on-the-same-page-when-modified-externally?rq=1). <comment273715> Thanks @Graham Miln, missed that one when I searched before posting.
