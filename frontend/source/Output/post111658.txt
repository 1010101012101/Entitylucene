AppleScript for counting messages in Inbox fails with "Can't get mailbox" <body> Here is my first attempt at an AppleScript program, which met with ignominious defeat:  precodetell application "Mail"     tell mailbox "INBOX"         count messages     end tell end tell /code/pre  It compiled, but when I ran it, I got the error message  precodeerror "Mail got an error: Canâ€™t get mailbox \"INBOX\"." number -1728 from mailbox "INBOX" /code/pre  Can someone tell me what is wrong, and if there is a short introduction to AppleScript, written for someone used to programming?  <answer111661> precodetell application "Mail"     -- This returns count of messages across all inboxes     set countA to count (messages of inbox)      set countB to count (messages of mailbox "INBOX" of account "david") end tell  return {countA, countB} /code/pre  In AppleScript Editor, hit command shift o to open the application dictionary. AppleScript 1-2-3 and the Definitive Guide are good places to start.  <answer111664> Your mistake is understandable in what you expect should be the syntax.  Each account has it's own mailbox named "INBOX"  In Mail the mailbox  stronginbox/strong  is the reference to the top level inbox that shows contents of all other inboxes named "INBOX"  2 examples:  Example 1  precodetell application "Mail"     set inboxes to first mailbox of every account whose name is "INBOX"     set messageCount to 0     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in inboxes          set this_item to item i of inboxes         if this_item is not missing value then             set thisCount to (count of (messages of this_item))             set messageCount to thisCount + messageCount             log thisCount         end if     end repeat  end tell log messageCount /code/pre  Example 2  precodetell application "Mail"     set messageCount to (count of (messages of inbox)) end tell  log messageCount /code/pre  Both return and log the same total.   But example 1 also logs the individual count of each "INBOX"  A good place to start is to read through:  AppleScript Fundamentals
