MacBook Pro case that ventilates and protects against dust <body> I like to use my MacBook remotely and therefore I need to leave it standby. I normally put away my MacBook in a slipcase. I guess this isn't a good idea when I use the MacBook (remotely) because of the heat and necessary ventilation.  Are there any solutions for using a MacBook remotely and still be able to protect it against dust? Some sort of a case that has ventilation?  <answer123031> Here is a possible solution for you.  Normally you would not need additional (forced) ventilation since MacBook does that as long it gets fresh air access.

There is no case which will keep your Macbook 100% dustfree and the ability to cool it. It's physically impossible.. Check these hard-cases - as they prevent your macbook from scratches for example: http://www.macbook-case.com/p/6/13-cases-macbook-pro/ <comment143618> Even if you remove the dust once a year, this is not an issue. Unless you work in the desert. <comment143621> I was thinking of some sort of box instead of a case. Something like once used for letterwheel printers (protect against sound not dust ...). Guess such thing doesn't exist, but couldn't resist to try anyway ...
