Symbolic links of plist file getting turned into plain text files <body> I'm trying to share my Sequel Pro favourites between my iMac and my Macbook Air. The method I'm using is this:    ol liOn the iMac, ove Favorites.plist from code~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data/code to code~/Dropbox/Apps/Sequel_Pro/code;  /li liOn the iMac, make a symbolic link to the Favorites.plist file (in Dropbox) and move that link into the code~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data/code folder;  /li liOn the Macbook, make a symbolic link to the Favorites.plist file (in Dropbox) and move that link into the code~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data/code folder/li /ol  In both steps 2 and 3 I need to rename the symbolic link file from codeFavorites.plist symlink/code to codeFavorites.plist/code in order to Sequel Pro to pick up on it.  What I find is that Sequel Pro on both machines opens with the favourites in place, but changes to the favourites are not reflected on the other machine and do not seem to be passed back to the original in Dropbox (there is no 'sync activity' indicator on the Dropbox icon). Further investigation reveals that, after opening Sequel Pro, the act of saving changes to the favourites (or of quitting the app, which I guess updates the favorites.plist as part of the quitting process) apparently changes the symbolic link into a regular text file rather than updating the original.    Is this expected behaviour?  Extra info: OSX 10.9.5, Sequel Pro 1.1  <answer218110> Yes, it's the expected behavior because Sequel Pro expects the codeFavorites.plist/code file to be where it's programmed to be, in code~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data/code.  In other words, when Sequel Pro opens, it reads the codeFavorites.plist/code file following the symlink because it's just making a read of the file.  When a change is make or the app closes the file is updated and is written in its programmed location and does not follow the symlink because first a temporary codeFavorites.plist.&lt;$random&gt;/code file is written and then the symlink is deleted and the temporary codeFavorites.plist.&lt;$random&gt;/code file is renamed to codeFavorites.plist/code.  In this process Sequel Pro sees the symlink of the codeFavorites.plist/code as a regular file not a symlink and why it's replaced.  <answer218112> user3439894 has confirmed that this is expected behaviour. I found a workaround, however, which is to move Favorites.plistâ€™s entire enclosing Data folder into Dropbox and to use that folder as the target for the the symbolic link rather than the individual file. That seems to work fine.  <comment263636> Yes, it's the expected behavior because Sequel Pro expects the `Favorites.plist` file to be where it's programmed to be, in `~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data`. <comment263638> @user3439894 that's helpful, thanks. If you change your comment to an answer then I can mark it as such. <comment263641> This works because the symlink is to a directory not an individual file and has to do with the process used to write out `.plist` files.  I added some info to my original answer to help explain.  BTW If Dropbox is unavailable the symlink to the Data folder might get deleted and the folder recreated at it original location, do make sure Dropbox is online before opening/closing Sequel Pro. <comment263643> That makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. <comment263644> +1 for the clarification regarding the multi-step process of writing the plist file
