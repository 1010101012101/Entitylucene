How do you access the user library on a time machine backup <body> With Lion 10.7, how does one access the user library on a time machine backup through the Finder?  <answer21298> Go to the Finder. In the menu bar, select Go, then hold down kbdOption/kbd. Select the "Library" option which appears.  Then enter Time Machine as per normal.  <answer41462> If you are accessing your Time Machine Backup with "Browse Other Backup Disks...", like you do if you created a fresh install of your OS, the solution from dan8394 does not work.    Probably because Time Machine can't know that your current Library folder is a newer version of the Library folder in the backup.   However, the solution proposed in a question that was closed as exact duplicate of this one works.   Lri helped me a lot with this answer:     The Library folder is probably just hidden by Finder. You can show strongemall   hidden files/em/strong by running this in Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true &amp;&amp; osascript -e 'quit app "Finder"' /code/pre      em(strongNote/strong: The part after the code&amp;&amp;/code will cause finder to stop, and you may need to restart it. So be aware that any open Finder windows may disappear.)/em      Changing codetrue/code to codefalse/code reverts the setting.   <comment76353> Thank-you! This is exactly what I needed, and what the Apple Genius wouldn't tell me.
