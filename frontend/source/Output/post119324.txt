Using Javascript | Applescript to click button in Safari <body> I realize there are several threads about this and they are all very specific to certain website . My background is in Python, not Javascript or Applescript, and I'm confused on exactly how to achieve this action .  I've seen several scripts doing this action, namely:  precodetell application "Safari"  activate  do JavaScript "document.forms['search']['order_list_search_batch'].click()"  end tell /code/pre  What is the best method to act this out ?  i'm confused on what goes in between code"document.forms[WHATGOESHERE?].click()"/code  I'm trying to click the Proceed button on http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi.  I went to "Inspect Element" on the Proceed button and got this code:  precode&lt;input style="cursor: pointer;" value="" name="proceed" class="proceed" onmouseover="this.style.cursor=&amp;quot;pointer&amp;quot;" type="submit"&gt; /code/pre  strongHow do I know what to put in script to click this button based off of the Inspect Element results ?/strong I want to understand so I can use this method in more than one case. There's not a href link that it goes to.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYnoS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Current code is not working  precodetell application "Safari" to activate open location "http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi" delay 3 tell application "Safari" to do JavaScript "document.forms[0].elements[document.forms[0].elements.length-1].click()" /code/pre  <answer119326> Despite the fact that this website has shitty code (too few IDs), something like :   precodetell application "Safari"     activate     open location "http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi"     delay 3     do JavaScript "document.forms['form'].submit()" in current tab of window 1 end tell /code/pre  should work.  It looks for the last element of the first form in the page.   hr  Just so you know :   precodedocument.forms['search']['order_list_search_batch'].click() /code/pre  This line does following :   ul liIt looks in the webpage /li liFor a form with codeid="search"/code/li liWithin that form, it looks for a child node with codeid=order_list_search_batch/code. /li liOnce this object is found, it performs a click on it.  /li /ul  <answer119337> For a minute there I thought you were asking the same question again as last time.  But  realise now you want to know how to use Inspect Element to construct your own code.  In the example you give: codedocument.forms[WHATGOESHERE?].click()/code  The strongWHATGOESHERE/strong would be the form name.  codei.e document.forms['theFormName'].click()/code  Your website in their wisdom has named the form 'strongform/strong'  code&lt;form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi" enctype="multipart/form-data" name="form"&gt;  &lt;input type="hidden" name="PAGE" value="2"&gt;/code  codei.e document.forms['form'].click()/code  But this would not click the stronginput/strong button  You can use the submit() function dot syntax'd on the end :  codedocument.forms['form'].submit()/code  Safari Applescript : codedo JavaScript "document.forms['form'].submit()"/code   hr  Also  In the code I provided you in your last question. I used:  precodetell document 1          do JavaScript "document.getElementsByClassName('proceed')[0].click()"      end tell /code/pre  This uses the class Name strongproceed/strong of the forms input element seen here: emclass=/em"strongproceed"/strong  code&lt;input value="" name="proceed" type="submit" class="proceed" onmouseover="this.style.cursor=&amp;quot;pointer&amp;quot;" style="cursor: pointer;"&gt;/code  The  codegetElementsByClassName('proceed')[0]/code does exactly what it says.  It stronggets/strong the strongElements/strong By strongClassName/strong  'strongproceed/strong'.  The strong[0]/strong  means it will give you the first element in it's results from the Array that would be returned. The array is counted from 0-9. So the first item would be item 0.  hr  A good place to get working examples and information about Javascript is at www.w3schools.com On the front page the have links to their HTML and Javascript examples and Tutorials. The elements of the HTML Dom and Javascript functions are listed for easy access.  <comment139190> i couldn't get it to work but i've put my code at the bottom of the question.  thank you for explaining what that other code was doing! <comment139191> My bad, I implied you had to add the click() method. I edited my answer ! <comment139193> i don't know why i didn't include .click() in it because I put it on there . is there something going on with my applescript that's not letting it work ? @matthieu riegler <comment139195> With my new edit it should work. <comment139196> did you actually see my edit on the last question ( http://stackoverflow.com/a/21217563/261305 )about how to click the proceed button. Also I have put an answer here that should throw some light on what you are trying to do.
