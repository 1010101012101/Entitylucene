How can I make iTerm2 *cd* into a directory by clicking on *ls* results? <body> Would make life somewhat easier when navigating around complex directory trees with long names.  I found these instructions for making strongcommand-click/strong trigger an action on the clicked filename or word. But after trying the codeRun command.../code option with codecd \1/code (for "cd to this clicked item"), that doesn't seem to work.  <comment372438> cd kbdTab/kbd will list the directories in the current directory - note this is the shell not iTem2/Terminal that does this <comment372476> Oh I know; but Tab completion often would be slower than being able to click `ls` results, especially if you have many directories with very similar names (which might require you to hit Tab multiple times before a single directory is isolated, or just type out the full name).
