How to capture the visible page screenshot in one step in Safari or another browser? <body> I have a large series of web pages to capture for documentation. Unfortunately it is mostly an interactive process, but can be repeated rather quickly.  At the moment I am using the dreaded "strongAwesome Screenshot/strong" extension because it has had the shortest path to the desired result so far, but yet it still has an extra step that I would like to eliminate.  Presently when I click the "strongAwesome Screenshot/strong" button in my toolbar I get an annotation page with the screenshot (emthis is the step I'd like to eliminate/em) and then upon clicking Done, I then get a draggable image.  Essentially I want to be able to initiate a shortcut (either by keypress or button click) and then immediately have an image to paste or drag into a document (e.g., in my case I want to paste it into PDFPen Pro to add it to the sequence).  Is there a way to shortcut this process in Safari, or any other browser on macOS for that matter, that will allow me to capture the visible portion of a webpage immediately to the pasteboard or to a draggable image so that capturing becomes a 1 step process?  <answer285788> emSo after a bit of playing with various options, I've come up with a pretty efficient solution:/em  I've found that even though it's older, using codePaparazzi/code is the most efficient solution.  I was able to set some sane defaults for the file naming (using YYYY-MM-DD as a base) and the output resolution (around 1020 (width) x1320 (height) for ~120ppi (kept font size output for my monitor resolution at about the same size) letter (8.5"x11") gives me a nice ordered image output that I can then import into PDFPen or Preview, etc. to generate a nice sequential PDF from the output.  This leads to a simple navigation from page to page and a quick codecmd-s + &lt;ENTER&gt;/code to save the image rapidly.
