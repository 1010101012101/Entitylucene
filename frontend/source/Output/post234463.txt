"Alignment grid" suddenly showed up on my desktop <body> I am on OS X 10.9   Yesterday, an "alignment grid" mysteriously showed up on my desktop.  How do I get rid of it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XIG22.jpg" alt="A photo of a desktop with alignment grid (on 10.11.4) as the grid doesn&#39;t appear on screenshots"  The grid lines don't show up when I do a proper, OS X screenshot. So I've taken a picture of my physical monitor, an Asus monitor, to show the problem.  <answer234739> As it turns out, the problem is with the monitor (Asus in my case), not OS X. You should be able to reset this - i.e. make the grid disappear - via the monitor's menu 'System Setup'.  <answer277959> S/A button on my Asus monitor turned mine off  <comment286657> A screenshot would be useful <comment286910> I love these 'screenshots'! (next time try `command alt shift 3` ;) <comment286922> @CousinCocaine maybe it's from the Monitor, so screenshot won't capture it? <comment286923> @MateuszSzlosek, indeed, and because the lines pass over the menubar this might indeed be the case. <comment286925> @Rogier, can you capture a screenshot using `Command` `Shift` `Option` `3` and post it as well? If the lines are not present on that screenshot, the lines are probably not coming from your OS, but from the monitors software itself. <comment286939> @Rogier you should post the answer in the answer section below. Don't edit the question and post it in the question body. You're quite correct: the problem is with the physical monitor, that's why it doesn't show up when you use the OS to take a screen shot.
