Disable photos in maps <body> The Maps app on the iPhone shows the photos from a business's Yelp page, but for some businesses these photos are inappropriate. Is there a way to block them?  <answer249467> No, switching to another mapping program would be the only option.  <comment309455> As far as I can tell, @tubedogg's answer (below) is correct.  I would also recommend [providing feedback to Apple](http://www.apple.com/feedback) and let them know about your concern.  I'm totally with you on this issue and I'll be letting Apple know, too.
