Photo Collection Collaboration <body> What I have is a very simple need, and I've not yet found a good solution. I have over 1.5 TB of photos stored on a shared server. I need to be able to tag the photos with keywords that are searchable. This part, I can do, using any number of applications.   The issue I am having is being able to share a metadata database that will not corrupt, and will update properly. Lightroom would have been a great choice for this along with Dropbox, but updates to the metadata database are inconsistent, and we have issues with conflicted copies and locking. I considered also using a tool such as Leap.app, but I haven't been able to share out the tagging database.   It is imperative that the solution allow me to store the photos on a central file server, and that the metadata be shared between users. Has anyone implemented a collaborative, tagging/keyword solution for thousands of photos in this manner? If so, what was your solution?
