I Pay for iTunes Match So Why Does iTunes Radio Now Have Ads (iTunes 12.0.1.26) <body> I pay for iTunes Match, account is in good standing, auto-renew is turned on.  I just update to iTunes 12.0.1.26 now I have ads when using iTunes radio.  How do I get rid of them?  I've already tried these recommendations.  strongUPDATE:/strong I went to emStore/em - emUpdate iTunes Match/em, after it updated I skipped through the max (6 songs) on 4 different stations (24 total songs) and have not seen an ad yet.  Maybe that did the trick.  I was skipping through them though, not listening to them.  <answer152207> I don't think they have anything to do with one another. iTunes match gives you the high-quality version of any song in your library. You can then have access to these songs from any of your devices.  iTunes radio is just listening to music, online, like a radio.  <answer171308> I have the same problem, and found something that worked. I skipped around 30 songs, listen to 3 on the same station (as I am writing this post) and no ads.  Devicesbr iPhone 5s - No commercials therebr 2 PCs: one with Windows 7 (64-bit) and the other Windows 8.1 (64-bit);   Problem:br I have iTunes Match and still here ads  Solution:br Enter iTunes → Store → Deauthorize this computer  Afterbr Store → Authorize this computerbr Store → Turn on iTunes match  <comment179522> They do have something to do with one another because by purchasing iTunes Match you are supposed to also get AD-free iTunes Radio as part of the deal.  From this thread (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6616500) it seems like it might just be a PC issue.  Users are saying iPads and iMacs are not getting ads, but PC users are. <comment179589> Ok, thanks for letting me know!
