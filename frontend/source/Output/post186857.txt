Graphic issues with Intel HD 4000 <body> Since two weeks I see an incrementation in odd, graphical rendering issues on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012). These issues include flickering, oddly shaped figures, graphical noise and other annoying stuff.   The graphical issues happen on both my LCD display and external display. The occurrence is mostly random, but tend to happen slightly more on my LCD display.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NW0xK.png" alt="Example of graphical rendering issues" emExample of graphical rendering issues/em  I have the following graphics/displays (I used codesystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType/code for dump):  precodeGraphics/Displays:  Intel HD Graphics 4000:    Chipset Model: Intel HD Graphics 4000   Type: GPU   Bus: Built-In   VRAM (Dynamic, Max): 1024 MB   Vendor: Intel (0x8086)   Device ID: 0x0166   Revision ID: 0x0009   Displays:     Color LCD:       Display Type: LCD       Resolution: 1280 x 800       Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)       Main Display: Yes       Mirror: Off       Online: Yes       Built-In: Yes     PLE2483H:       Resolution: 1920 x 1080 @ 60 Hz       Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)       Display Serial Number: 1127842305866       Mirror: Off       Online: Yes       Rotation: Supported       Connection Type: Analog VGA or Analog Over DVI-I       Adapter Firmware Version: 0,00 /code/pre  I use an Mini-display port to VGA adapter for my external display.

I am deeply sorry for your loss.   #AlsoLostAGPUOnMyMac  <answer188017> Hi I believe it's not a dying GPU because we have same issue in all our MAC's.  It started after Yosemite upgrade.   https://www.dropbox.com/s/n04b4tmbbggkftd/wierdvideoproblem.mp4?dl=0  It may be Little Snitch. I disabled network traffic activity monitor, because glitch update pattern is like a data transfer pattern.  I'll post updates.  <answer197822> Let me guess: the issue appeared with the 10.10.3 update? Well, then I am 98% certain it is a bug in OS X Yosemite. Your issue is related with this one.   Users report erratic kernel panics and some users have graphics glitches like you. The only common feature is having a Intel HD 4000 GPU.  On MacBook Pros with dual GPU you can avoid the problem by strongdisabling Automatic Graphics Switching/strong (System Preferences  Energy Saver).   Please contribute to the thread in the apple discussion forum and file a bug report (with link to the thread).   <answer231357> Turning off Little Snitch network monitor and automatic graphic switching seems to have worked for me.  <comment220680> 2 questions. does it work in safe mode? did you do the Apple Hardware test ? and that is on the LCD display, or is it the external display or both <comment220681> Haven't tried in safe mode, will do that now. And yes, I did the Apple Hardware test four days ago: nothing was found. I will try these again and keep you posted. Thanks so far! <comment220684> There is nice non-invasive app that does system profile and more - get it from here and try it. http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck <comment220687> @Buscar웃 I am using Safe Boot currently. On boot, immediate flickering occured and everything feels really slow (relatively simple animations take about 5 seconds to complete). Firefox crashed several times. No persistent graphical issues detected so far. I used the EtreCheck application and edited the post with the results. <comment220689> @Buscar웃 I will run the hardware test now. <comment220690> Doing great so far :) <comment220694> Sorry, I have to leave now, but so far no indication. If it would be the cable the issue would be all over the screen. Afraid to say but it might be your logic board (GPU). Check if you might be covered by Apple program to replace GPU (for free) on MBP models. https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/ <comment220697> My MacBook is ineligible for a free GPU replacement. If the issues persist throughout this week, I'll take my MacBook to the Genius Bar. For testing purposes, I won't use my other screen. Thanks so far! <comment220804> "The graphical issues happen on both my LCD display and external display” - this is the 99% fail-proof test that your machine’s GPU is fried. You need a logic board replacement :(. <comment220817> Thanks for your response. That's really unfortunate. Luckily I have a insurance that might cover the repair costs. I will make an appointment with the Genius Bar this week and discuss it with them. <comment222403> We also have lots of kernel panics (twice a day), but with always different back. We have Samsung EVO 850 in common. This might be the cause? <comment222533> I am not sure the Samsung EVO 850 is the cause of the issue, but I will try my old HDD this weekend. I feel like Little Snitch might be the cause, because I remember that these graphical rendering issues started after a Little Snitch update (most recent version). Also, when I am using Bootcamp, I don't seem to have any issues. Thanks for your response! <comment222669> After disabling the Network Monitor I have had no crashes or odd graphical rendering issues. So far, so good. I will get in touch with Objective Development to report this, as it seems like a rather major bug. <comment222837> Also, these users (on the Objective Development forum) report the same issues as well: https://forums.obdev.at/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=9758
