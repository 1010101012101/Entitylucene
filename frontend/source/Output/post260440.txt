Chrome is very slow due to "Resolving host in proxy script..." <body> I'm using a proxy script to connect to the Internet. I've set it, system wide, in :  precodeSystem preferences -&gt; Network -&gt; Advanced... -&gt;Proxies -&gt; Automatic Proxy Configuration /code/pre  and it works well.  I've also set it in Firefox  precodePreferences... -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Network -&gt; Connection -&gt; Settings -&gt; Automatic Proxy Configuration URL /code/pre  and it works well too.  In Safari, which use the system proxy configuration everything works well.  BUT in chrome Version 54.0.2840.87 (64-bit), which should use also the system proxy configuration everything is very slow and I always see, in the status bar, the message :  precodeResolving host in proxy script... /code/pre  I've found the following thread about Proxy Pac and Sierra but it doesn't help.  Any idea?  P.S. I'm using macOS 10.12.1  <answer267724> We had the issue due to having 4-5 old old DNS servers manually entered in the mac's network settings. The machine was trying to contact each of these and timing out. Once we cleaned up DNS the problem went away.   <answer272518> I had a similar problem but it was only happening when using Chrome over a VPN connection, Safari was ok. Looking at the Chrome events using codechrome://net-internals/#events/code I noticed that I had codeHOST_RESOLVER_IMPL_JOB/code events that were trying to connect to codeMy-MacBook-Pro.local/code but failing. I could ping codeMy-MacBook-Pro/code but not codeMy-MacBook-Pro.local/code.  I resolved it by going to System Preferences - Sharing and turning on one of the services (Printer Sharing, File Sharing etc). Once I had done that I could ping codeMy-MacBook-Pro.local/code and Chrome started responding properly.  <answer284276> I was experiencing this issue while using a corporate VPN from Chrome on a Mac. I resolved it by:  ol liGetting the full hostname from running the command codehostname/code/li liOpening up code/etc/hosts/code in an editor, with write permissions, e.g. codesudo vi /etc/hosts/code/li liAdding the name of the machine to localhost, e.g.  precode127.0.0.1   localhost Eamons-MacBook-Pro.local /code/pre/li liSaving code/etc/hosts/code/li /ol  Caveat: It is possible that code/etc/hosts/code may be updated by the system during reboots and upgrades, and changes could be lost.  <comment327172> Hi, did you found a solution ? I get the same problem since i migrated to sierra .... <comment327180> For now my solution is to use Firefox... <comment335692> Same problem here, and I had to use Firefox for now as well.. <comment336099> I've no manually entered DNS. DNS servers are obtained through corporate DHCP and I'm pretty sure it's correctly configured. <comment336469> We used dig to prove to ourselves that the DNS servers we were trying to use were really really slow. dig same website from a mac terminal window and see if it's slow. that was basically our issue. <comment367724> Curious as to why this works. I don't have my hostname aliased to 127.0.0.1 but I can still ping it.
