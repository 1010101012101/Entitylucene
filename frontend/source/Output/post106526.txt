OS X Mavericks - Have to pull mouse down on full-screen app to see dock <body> Updated to Mavericks yesterday, pretty happy with the speed boost it brought, but I've run into one problem:   Whenever I'm running a full-screen app, for example mail, and I want my dock to show, I really have to pull the mouse down. Just "throwing" it down to the bottom of the screen with a one-finger swipe no longer does the trick; I have to keep my finger on the trackpad to get the dock to show.  I asked a colleague and he noticed the same thing, only in a full-screen app, is there a way to turn this "feature" off, or is this a bug?  <answer108375> This seems to be the new gesture in Mavericks.  It used to be that you had to pull the mouse/trackpad down twice in quick succession.  Now you just have to hold the mouse/trackpad down at the bottom of the screen.  I had not figured this one out before reading your post, so thank you.  I have found nothing about this anywhere else. Apparently, this gesture cannot be changed.  <answer111574> As I remember, it was actually the same mechanic before. The difference is that now you have to do the second swipe strongslowly/strong. And it's really annoying.  <answer112513> In order to get the Dock to appear for full-screen app, emrest/em (don't click) your finger on the mouse anywhere on the screen, emwhile swiping/em to the bottom of the screen. The Dock will then appear immediately when you hit bottom.   hr  Note that none of the other methods described here work reliably for me, but this one does every time.  <comment129928> Well, that sucks. Thanks for your update though! Guess I won't work with full-screen apps, because it really annoys me. <comment132107> That doesn't quite describe the behavior I'm seeing. In fact, I'm really not sure what it is, as it seems to be a bit different each time. There must be some documentation of this somewhere, and one would hope there's a way to configure it too. In the meantime, this really doesn't work for me. <comment132108> I've found [a method](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/112513/4395) that works for me every time.
