Disabling Find My Mac <body> My iCloud account was recently messed with by a bitter ex. I have figured out which iCloud account they used to put my Mac in lost mode, but when I sign on to Find My Mac the Unlock button is greyed out. What can I do to unlock my computer?  <comment198095> Have you checked to see if you still have access to your iCloud account? I suspect the password was changed, but if not, it should be fairly easy to remedy the problem.
