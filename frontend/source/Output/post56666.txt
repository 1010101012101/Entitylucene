Can't find sshd process <body> Using PuTTY on my Windows laptop, I am able to codessh/code into my Mac desktop, but once I've logged in, I can't find any codesshd/code process running on the Mac.  E.g. running the following right after ssh-ing into the Mac:  precode% ps -eo pid,command | grep sshd | grep -v grep /code/pre  ...produces no output.  emOf course, needless to say, I get the same results (no output) if I use codeps -ef/code instead of codeps -eo pid,command/code./em  Also, there's no code/var/run/sshd.pid/code file.  What's going on?  Does OS X use a different program to handle incoming ssh logins?  <answer56667> let me clarify:  sshd by default is no longer an active process on boot after 10.3.  launchd now handles the listening for ssh.  sshd only is running when an ssh session is active.  <answer56669> No - OS X uses OpenSSH and you can inspect the source code used here.  Based on your output, it looks like sshd is not active on the machine. Also codeps|grep ssh[d]/code will prevent your grep process from matching the target. Some people get concerned when they don't see sshd running, since it gets started on demand when launchd detects an incoming network request. Are you certain ssh is active? You could verify this with codelsof|grep ssh/code if you have doubts.  Look for this when one ssh has been initiated recently on Lion:  precodeLast login: Mon Jul 16 17:58:26 2012 from 10.0.1.35 mac:~ mike$ ps -ef|grep sshd 0   60320     1   0  4:23PM ??         0:00.00 /usr/libexec/launchproxy /usr/sbin/sshd -i 0   60321 60320   0  4:23PM ??         0:00.15 /usr/sbin/sshd -i 501 60330 60321   0  4:23PM ??         0:00.01 /usr/sbin/sshd -i 501 60336 60331   0  4:23PM ttys003    0:00.00 grep sshd /code/pre  <answer274513> Is it okay to post to a really old question... I was looking to answer the same today and will attempt to clarify the clarify.  Remote Login enabled in System Preferences Sharing and port 22 is open:  precode% netstat -p tcp -lna | grep '\*\.22' tcp4       0      0  *.22 *.*  LISTEN      tcp6       0      0  *.22 *.*  LISTEN /code/pre  Then lsof shows launchd is the one listening (found the right options for lsof in the man page and executed as root):  precode# lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep ssh launchd    1 root   50u  IPv6 0xc3c700cb936cd50f      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN) launchd    1 root   51u  IPv4 0xc3c700cb9452be6f      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN) launchd    1 root   53u  IPv6 0xc3c700cb936cd50f      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN) launchd    1 root   58u  IPv4 0xc3c700cb9452be6f      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN) /code/pre  And when you ssh into the system you see that ssh-agent and sshd are spawned to deal with the connection.  precode # ps -ef | grep ssh | grep -v grep  501  1231     1   0 12:52PM ??         0:00.02 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l  0    1257     1   0 12:53PM ??         0:00.04 sshd: xxxxx [priv]   501  1259  1257   0 12:53PM ??         0:00.02 sshd: xxxxx@ttys002  /code/pre  <comment65144> Downvoted for not showing *also* the output you get from `ps -eo pid,command|grep sshd`.  It will show at least as many processes as those shown by `ps -ef|grep sshd`, proving that my failure to observe a `sshd` process is not explained by my choice of flags to `ps`. <comment65146> As I wrote in my original description, I am looking for the `sshd` process *from within* an `ssh` session, so, if your explanation were correct, I should have been able to find the `sshd` process behind it. <comment65151> Seriously - you down vote over a ps argument choice? The PID is clearly the second column and the command is the last column in the `-ef` but it's your vote to cast. Your criticism of everyone that stepped up to try to help seems an odd way to attract more help. <comment65196> My comment, and downvote, was in response to your original post, which started: "It looks like your syntax is a bit off."  *Which syntax* in particular is off, and how exactly does this "off syntax" cause my not being able to see an `sshd` process?  Later you write: "Also `ps|grep ssh[d]` will prevent your grep process from matching the target."  I don't see why this is relevant, since, I did *not* use `ps|grep sshd`, nor did I use `ps|grep ssh`.  Finally,... <comment65197> ...you wrote: "Some people get concerned when they don't see sshd running, since it gets started on demand when launchd detects an incoming network request."  Given that I clearly wrote that I searched for the `sshd` process immediately *after* `ssh`-ing into the Mac, your last remark, as well as the questions you ask in the revised version of your answer, make me question whether you actually read my post. <comment345232> Are you implying that `ssh-agent` runs on the remote side, and that it is responsible to deal with the connection? How does this fit to `man ssh-agent` stating that `ssh-agent` is »started in the beginning of […] a login session« and then »used for authentication when logging in to other machines using ssh«? Doesn’t this imply that the agent rather runs on the local side rather than the remote side, typically before the user has even started ssh to connect to a remote server?
