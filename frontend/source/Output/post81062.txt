Applescript click automation in Google Chrome browser? <body> Hello fellow programmers!  I would like to save some applescript code as an application, so that when I open the application it will go to Google Chrome and answer an incoming call in Google Voice.  I will have my gmail account already open in the chrome browser, so all that is needed is for the applescript application to tell google chrome to activate, then click in a particular area (where the button will appear) to accept the call.  How can I find out the coordinates of where I want the mouse to click? Because I am making a separate application to click elsewhere and end the call.  Can anyone tell me how I would code this in applescript? or is there an easier way?  The following code is similar to something I found, and it works, but i'm not sure where/if it is clicking...  precodetell application "Safari" to activate tell application "System Events"    tell process "Safari"    click at {300, 100} -- {from left, from top}    end tell end tell /code/pre  Thank you for your time, -Sebastian  <answer81244> It looks like it's clicking 300 pixels right, and 100 pixels down from the top left corner. (I'm not sure if that's the top left corner of the screen or of the Safari window...) You can find out where that is by pressing kbdShift/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbd4/kbd, then moving the cross hair until the top number is 300, and the bottom number is 100. You can get rid of the cross hair by pressing kbdescape/kbd. Then you can work out where you'd really like the script to click, and change the numbers in the script to match.  <answer92666> You can also click elements with JavaScript:  precodetell application "Google Chrome" to tell active tab of window 1     execute javascript "document.getElementById('chrome-web-store-title').click()"     --execute javascript "document.querySelectorAll('.tile-grid .most-visited')[3].click()" end tell /code/pre  Focusing an existing tab by URL:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     repeat with w in windows         set i to 1         repeat with t in tabs of w             if URL of t starts with "https://mail.google" then                 set active tab index of w to i                 set index of w to 1                 return             end if             set i to i + 1         end repeat     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <answer167596> It's easy,you can do it in five steps!  ol liopen applescript editor/li liclick codeRecord/code/li liopen Finder and activate Google Chrome/li liclick codeStop/code or the circle with a hexagon in front of it/li lipress kbdCmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd and a window will appear - save your script as an application and click the circle with the words "start-up"  next to it/li /ol  Epilogue: restart your Mac and watch Chrome appear like magic!  <comment93745> Thank you for that shortcut, daviewales! Only issue is that clicking only seems to work within the realms of the BROWSER itself... as in, I can click and open a new tab, click file, refresh button, but NOT any button on the actual website. Any solutions? <comment93749> I just tested it, and I found that I could make it click on emails in Gmail, and buttons on the Google home page, but I couldn't make it click on any of the buttons in the Google Talk window.
