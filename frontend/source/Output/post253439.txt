Possible to continue using iMac keyboard on iMac, when another computer connects in Target Display Mode? <body> I have a MacBook Pro which I use to connect to my iMac, using Target Display Mode (TDM) via Thunderbolt.  Furthermore, I've got a secondary screen connected to my iMac via an DVI cable.  When I invoke TDM, my MacBook will take control of its own screen and the iMac screen.  But the em2nd screen/em is still displaying my iMac.  What I would like to do here, is emcontinue to use my iMac, only on the 2nd screen/em, while the MacBook gets to control my iMac screen.  The emmouse/em of the iMac still works on my em2nd screen/em. But the iMac strongemkeyboard/em/strong does not work. For some reason, the only character I can type with it is kbda/kbd.  Question: Is there a way to get the iMac keyboard working in this setup?  hr  This is kind of what my setup looks like (not my image, but pretend itâ€™s a MacBook Pro, iMac and secondary screen):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fa9rU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment315384> Why can't you just use the second screen for your MacBook? <comment315385> @IronCraftMan That's what I'm doing while we try to figure out the answer to the question in the OP :)
