Problem installing cover version <body> I tried installing the visualizer plugin Cover Version with my new mac with OS Sierra. I followed the instructions and put the file in the itunes plugin folder, but it doesn't show up in iTunes among the Visualizer options. I restarted iTunes (and my Mac) but that didn't help.   Any ideas?   <answer276167> It was a stupid mistake on my part; I put the .dmg file in the plugin folder instead of the actual CoverVersion.bundle file. Now it works perfectly  <comment345383> Related https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7773/view-song-lyrics-in-itunes?rq=1 <comment345384> I've just downloaded and installed CoverVersion from http://www.imagomat.de/coverversion/, it still seems to work under Sierra. Did you give it a try? <comment345478> @patrix I did, but iTunes does not display Cover View as an option in the Visualizer section.. But then I guess this is a problem with my mac and not with the OS <comment345485> I assume you did restart iTunes after copying the bundle to `~/Library/iTunes/iTunes Plugins`? <comment345500> @patrix Indeed.. I also restarted my mac <comment345508> Do you want to rephrase the question? If it is a local issue, the question as written is primarily a duplicate of the existing question <comment345547> @patrix I did, thanks! :-)
