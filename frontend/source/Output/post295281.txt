How can I delete videos off iTunes Library on my computer but keep them on my iPhone? <body> My computer is running low on space, so after I sync my films to my iPhone, I want to delete them from my computer.  How can I do this, without having iTunes sync this deletion back to my iPhone the next time I connect my iPhone?  <answer295284> Under your iPhone’s strongSummary/strong page in iTunes, emcheck/em codeManually manage videos/code (if you don’t use iTunes Match or MUSIC this option will read codeManually manage music and videos/code).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KjKeB.jpg" alt="Manually manage videos"  This will let you decide what gets synced and what doesn’t.
