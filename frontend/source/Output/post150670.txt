Can a Body Dent on Mac book pro be repaired? <body> I have a Mac book pro 15 inch mid 2010 &amp; there is a small dent between the touch pad &amp; space bar as i dropped a metal ball by accident however it does not effect the performance of my Laptop at all, can it be repaired ? It does't look good...!!!  <answer150677> Not at the Apple Store.  They will give you a quote to replace the housing.  You'll have to bring it to a body shop to find out if it can be repaired!
