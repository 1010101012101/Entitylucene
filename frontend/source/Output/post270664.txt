Help with route to get VPN clients in one interface, access internet via another <body> Hi I need help with some routing issues. I have mac server with VPN setup and have 2 internet interfaces connected to the mac server. One is a an airport (main cable internet) and one is a 4G router.  The airport provides internet via wifi, the 4G router is connected via ethernet. (The only way we can do it right atm)  I'll explain what I am trying to do - I need VPN clients to connect via the cable (airport) to the mac server and also be able to access the internet emvia the 4G router/em.  So clients come in via the airport and can access the internal network and the internet via 4G routers IP.  I have discovered if I have the Wi-Fi interface before the Ethernet in Network prefs on the server then clients can connect fine but have no internet access. If clients connect first then I switch so that Ethernet is first (while clients still connected) they can access the internet. Obviously this isn't a practical solution, but maybe proves it can work?  Thanks for the help!  <comment340193> Sorry, but I'm having difficulty understanding your exact scenario, as your question seems to contradict itself. Can you clarify whether you have only one device connected via ethernet (i.e. the 4G router) or whether you have multiple ethernet connections? And when you say you _have 2 internet interfaces connected to the Mac server_ are you saying that you have two **internet** connections, or just that you have an ethernet connection **and** a Wi-Fi connection? In summary, do you have users connecting via one network port who then require internet access through another? Or something else? <comment340196> I have 2 internet connection. I want my vpn clients to come in via one connection but access the internet via the other. So the clients have internet access via the 4g router (connected to the server machine via ethernet) but they dial into the other internet connection to connect to the vpn. Basicly i need the clients to have the 4g ip as their internet ip but would like to come in via the 2nd connection incase the 4g goes down they can still have local server access. <comment340197> current setup: cable modem (bridge mode) - airport express - server (wifi). server - 4g modem (ethernet).
