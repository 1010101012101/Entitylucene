Iphone 4 Verizon. I cannot find Itunes Radio <body> I updated my Iphone 4 and I was playing Itunes Radio for the first couple of days. All of a sudden it disappeared and I no longer have access to Itunes Radio. It is no longer in my music app. I live in the US so this cannot be an US only issue.  Please help  <comment121251> nevermind. I killed the running app and restarted it and it was there. <comment121267> See here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/102958/48249
