Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost fe80::1%lo0     localhost /code/pre  Remove any codegs.apple.com/code entries.

It transpires that I had moved from Australia to the UK and the apps that were causing the issue were installed when I was in Australia.  To solve the issue I had to logout from my UK AppStore Account and logon using my Australian AppStore account. Once I did this and chose to update the apps it all worked.  Oh, make sure you logout of the old Appstore account and back in with your current region's account when finished.  <comment315102> Do you know how long this has been happening for? Does the App Store app indicate you have any updates? And have you tried logging out of your account and logging back in? <comment315125> Nope. tried all three, but none of them work :( . I did not have com.apple.appstore.plist and com.apple.storeagent.plist. <comment315126> Tried everything <comment315128> Added Step 4 check whether it works. <comment315129> Please check I've added Step 4. <comment315130> Try close App Store, then open Apple Menu  - About This Mac - Software Update… <comment315161> Don't get any debug menu :(. Is it on the bar where it says 'App Store    Edit    Store'?  Where else can it be? <comment315163> Sorry, Does not work :(. <comment315165> This is an extra menu next to the help menu. If you insert the following command in the Terminal do you receive any output? `defaults read com.apple.appstore` <comment315229> yes. I get an output. it is too long to post as a comment. see it on github here: https://github.com/suryanisaac/Errors/blob/master/OutputFordefaults-read-com.apple.appstore <comment315318> Have you tried deleting "/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist", restarting your Mac and then trying again? <comment315328> It's the same output as mine, but I don't understand that you cannot see it. If you open the App Store on the top of your screen next to the help menu should be the Debug menu. <comment315349> ScreenShot: https://github.com/suryanisaac/Errors/blob/master/Pasted%20Graphic%201.tiff <comment315377> Ok try following: Type in terminal: `open $TMPDIR../C/` and delete the **com.apple.appstore** folder. Restart, empty trash and open AppStore. <comment315471> Nope Does not work :( . I am waiting for 22nd to update to the stable version. (It is releasing in india on 22nd) <comment315516> Sorry, my options goes to the end. You can try the suggestions from @sfaruque and but I think this will not solve the problem. The only that I still think that the App may be corrupt. If you have an earlier backup, rename the current app and move the earlier backup to the app-folder.
