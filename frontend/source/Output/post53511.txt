How to convert Keynote to PowerPoint online <body> Is there a way to convert a downloaded Keynote (from slideshare) file to a PowerPoint file (or an open format like Open/LibreOffice) online?  <answer53522> I don't know if this is what you are after but this YouTube is a video on exporting a keynote slideshow as a powerpoint presentation. There is also Zamzar.  <answer53524> Zamzar claims to convert Keynote files to different formats (including PowerPoint) online. I don't use Keynote, so I can't vouch for the quality of the conversions, but here's one review of the free file conversion service.  <answer134709> Here is how you can do this...  ol liSign in / up for iCloud at www.icloud.com/li liOpen the online "Keynote" app/li liDrag your Keynote file onto the browser window/li liKeynote browser app will open your presentation/li liMake any changes etc./li liClick the wrench icon on top right, and select "Download a copy"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KfYjP.png" alt="Click the wrench icon on top right, and select &quot;Download a copy&quot;" 7. Keynote will prompt you with option to download a PPT / PDF / Keynote file  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHhXs.png" alt="Keynote will prompt you with option to download a PPT / PDF / Keynote file" 8. Select PPT and ye shall receive a Powerpoint version :-)  <answer194025> Simply Export the file out of Keynote as a Powerpoint.  It does a dang good job of maintaining the formatting.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EFmHL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment61220> Are you wanting to know how to convert a keynote file to a powerpoint file? Or what kind of formats are you wanting? <comment61223> thanks but i'm looking for a way to convert an already downloaded keynote (from slideshare) to ppt <comment61288> Good find. It seems to convert Keynote files quite well -- at least as well as Powerpoint does itself: elements are separate, with editable text fields. <comment61333> I wouldn't actually call Powerpoint "open"... <comment61334> @patrix you're correct, I meant either open in powerpoint or open in a different "open" format such as open office. <comment123249> I just tried Zamzar and compared it with the "Export..." function in Keynote. Unfortunately, the .ppt file from Zamzar had to be "repaired" by powerpoint, resulting in the same flaws observed when exporting from .key to .ppt within Keynote. Hence, no improvement (at least for me and my keynote presentation. <comment159528> @bcholbeisineeman Why not just open it in Keynote, click `Export` and choose ppt (PowerPoint). Obviously, transitions are lost due to compatibility, but I assume converting does not do that either. <comment168166> Wow, I didn't know about https://www.icloud.com/#keynote.  This was exactly what I wanted.  I was nervous about uploading my file to some other site like Zamzar.  I'm glad Apple has its own free solution. Thanks. <comment261034> This is not "Here is how you can do this..." but "The only correct way to do it" <comment364002> @bcholbeisineeman DevIntern's [answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/134709/243377) should be the accepted answer - it is a free solution provided by the owner of the proprietary format with no limitations on file size or otherwise.
