Automated/Simple Deletion of Apps from iTunes Library <body> Is there an approach to querying the local iTunes library to remove apps that aren't currently installed on any of your devices?  <answer38180> I might suggest a really wild -- possibly dangerous -- approach. If you have a good backup, it is less dangerous, but until you have restored from that backup there still can be snags and problems in a restore that you want find until that point. The good news is you don't need the backup, it's just there I case a crash happens in the middle of this process.  ul liFirst make sure you've got a emgood backup/em of your iTunes library.  /li liThen emdelete/em all your apps from iTunes./li liFinally, sync each of your iDevices and when it tells you it found apps on the iDevice(s) that were not in the library, make sure you tell it to emrestore/em them back to the library./li /ul  You should end up with only those apps that are installed on at least one iDevice!  (In theory, at least.) And if anything fails, restore the library from its backup.  <answer75810> This worked for me without any issue:  ol liConnect you iDevice to computer, let the sync complete (or cancel as per your choice)/li liIn the iTunes app library, select all (kbdCmd/kbdkbdA/kbd) and delete. on the prompt select Move to Recycle Bin./li liDo strongnot/strong sync now, go to FilesDevicesTransfer Purchase from "Your iDevice"/li /ol  <comment44567> Actually, you can connect each iDevice and **Transfer purchases** to iTunes. <comment46698> I've done this alreadyâ€”I didn't do it quite correctly, and ended up losing a few hundred apps. Restoring from the backup restored the apps, but it took days to download them all and I lost a few apps' data. <comment46707> Unfortunately I don't think there's a reverse lookup of installed apps from the local iTunes library. Apps on the device are referenced in the local library not the other way around. <comment46758> @TimothyMueller-Harder - I've done the *delete all apps from itunes and transfer purchases from iDevice* several times and it worked flawlessly each time. However, if your try to sync, it will delete the apps from your iDevice. <comment46799> @Vlad I didn't do it right. When I restored from the backup, I lost some data. I'm not blaming it on your method. <comment48485> After a healthy round of backups for all devices involved, I tried this approach.  It worked just fine.  I would say that this approach is not for the faint of heart and if you're not familiar with backup/restore of devices, I don't recommend this approach.  That being said, I'm glad to see my app count down to 100 :-) <comment88007> Since the question specifies ***any of your devices*** do you need to connect them all in step one and transfer them all back own step 3? Have you tried this on more than one or ten devices?
