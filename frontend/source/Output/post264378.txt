Hereâ€™s what you do for a MacBook Air:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the strongsame time/strong kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Let us know how you go. Many of your symptoms are listed in Apple's article on when you might want to try a SMC reset after performing a somewhat long set of other checks first to be sure it's not software or basic settings:  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295/li /ul  <answer264408> Your 3 points are all strongly related. Hold the Power button and keep holding until the mac shuts off.  Then release the Power button. Wait ten seconds.  Then do the SMC reset, doing it 2 or 3 times does not hurt.  <comment331325> It doesn't help either.
