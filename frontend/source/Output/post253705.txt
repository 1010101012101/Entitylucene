How to get rid of the "Grant File Access" dialog in Word 2016+AppleScript when inserting a picture <body> We use AppleScript to create MS Word documents, which also included pictures. This works fine with Word 2011, but I run into problems with Word 2016.   When opening files with Word 2016 via AppleScript, a "Grant File Access" dialog window pops up. This probably has to do with sandboxing. For opening documents I fixed it by passing a codefile/code-object to the codeopen/code method:  precode    tell application "Microsoft Word"         open "path:to:some:file.docx" --Grant File Access dialog         open file "path:to:some:file.docx" --No dialog, success! /code/pre  However, when inserting a picture, I can't seem to find a way to pass a codefile/code-object. I use this code:  precode    set imageFile to choose file     tell application "Microsoft Word"         open file someFilePath         tell document someFileName             make new inline picture at before text object of cell 1 of row 1 of table 1 Â¬               with properties {file name:(imageFile as text), save with document:true} /code/pre  The property codefile name/code doesn't accept a codefile/code-object, and there is no property codefile/code.  Is there a way to get rid of this dialog?
