mysql.sock gets deleted on restart <body> I have set up PHP and MySQL, however MySQL wants the codemysql.sock/code file in code/var/mysql/code, which is fair enough. I change the directory to code/var/mysql/code however every time I restart my computer codemysql.sock/code gets deleted and I can't work.  Has anyone got any ideas on how I can fix this problem?   <answer32188> It is not ridiculous at all. I'd assume that, seeing you're coming from a Windows environment, you simply don't understand Unix sockets.  An Unix socket file is created when codemysqld/code is started up, and codemysql.sock/code is that file. It is a faster alternative to TCP/IP for use on a local system.  So yeah, it is actually totally normal that the file is deleted when you restart your computer: once the server is off, there's no reason for the communication line (socket) to still be open.  Your problem is not about the file missing, but about the server not starting up automatically on restart. You probably didn't have this problem “on Windows at work” not because of Windows, but because of work, where your workstation was set up to start MySQL server on boot.  Simply check the “Automatically Start MySQL Server on Startup” checkbox in the MySQL prefpane (in System Preferences) if you used the standard installer, or see the “MySQL does not start on startup” question in case of a problem on Lion or another installation method.  <comment36905> Shouldn't `mysql.sock` be created automatically when the server starts? Have you made sure the MySQL server restarts automatically when you restart? <comment36906> It would also be useful to say how you've installed MySQL: official installer, MacPorts, some MAMP bundles, ...? <comment36943> Ok, that makes sense, the problem now is the server won't even start since i've changed the location of where mysql.sock file is created, even with the "Automatically Start MySQL" check selected. However when I change the location back to /tmp/ folder low and behold it works again!!! But the web page with still try and look for the mysql.sock back in the /var/mysql/ directory. I've installed everything into Mac itself and not using any MAMP or other server programs to do this. Sorry for the very Amateur questions. <comment37228> Hey Richard, getting back to you: was your problem solved?
