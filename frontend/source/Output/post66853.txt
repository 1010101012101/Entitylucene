How can I hear ambient noise while listening to music via Bluetooth? <body> I have seen apps like Awareness or PlayEar that allow one to hear ambient audio while listening to music, but none of them support listening over bluetooth.  Is there an app that does, or a way I can get around this restriction (possibly by jailbreaking)?  <comment78740> Welcome to Ask Different! You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks.
