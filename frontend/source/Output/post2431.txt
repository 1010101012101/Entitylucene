Is it possible to redefine what Keynote interprets as bold and normal for a particular font? <body> When working in Keynote I like to use medium and light fonts instead of bold and normal. This causes me a problem because when I hit apple-b to embolden something I want the font to be switched to medium instead of bold, but the default is the bold font. Is there someway for me to either a) redefine what a particular presentation interprets as bold and normal or b) assign a different shortcut key to switch the font between medium and light?  strongUPDATE:/strong An option c) occurs to me too: could I copy the whole font somehow and play around with its definition to replace normal with light and bold with medium?  <answer2433> To answer directly to your two questions:   a) No, you can’t redefine what is bold and what is normal as far as I know, Medium and Light are different styles than Regular and Bold and there isn’t a keyboard shortcut to set them (nor a menu item for that) and because of the latter, you can’t set a keyboard shortcut.   b) Because of (a), you can’t really do this.  A (lame) alternative is to use Copy Style kbdcmd/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdc/kbd and paste style kbdcmd/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdv/kbd. But that requires that you find a piece of text that has the same size/font.  Also having the Formatting bar visible makes it easier (albeit with the mouse) to change that: kbdshift/kbd+kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd.  <comment2104> c) Yes, but font editing software is expensive, and fonts are a particularly fragile file format. <comment2107> Exactly, what @phillip said. You can play around with a font, but you might end up causing more trouble than anything else. <comment2112> OK, thanks. If I'm ever feeling a little foolhardy I might give it a go and report back. <comment2113> Yup, it was (a) that seemed like the stumbling block to me too. Thanks for the info though. <comment2130> I find it very odd that it’s not possible, but I haven’t found a way. :(
