ctkahp quit unexpectedly <body> I am getting "ctkahp quit unexpectedly" regularly on my macOS Sierra 10.12.1 Mac Mini.  I cannot find any resources about what this process is.  When this error occurs, my machine can't connect to the internet at all and I get a ton of errors, iCloud, etc.  I have to reboot to make it go away.  <comment324864> ctkahp is part of the [CryptoTokenKit](http://www.macinside.info/process.php?id=12409) framework introduced in Yosemite. How do you connect to the internet? <comment326533> wifi & ethernet (both are active). <comment358378> Perhaps it was a firewall issue, e.g. like Snitch or Flocker?
