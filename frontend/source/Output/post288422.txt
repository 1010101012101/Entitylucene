How to boot iPhone 6 via the logic board <body> I've seen a video of a guy making an iPhone with some random iPhone parts.  Before setting everything together, he made a test build. He just used screen, battery and the logic board itself. He clicked on something on the logic board and the iPhone started booting.   Check 15:50 in the YouTube video, How I Made My Own iPhone - in China.  I am wondering how he did that. Does anyone know what that is called?  <comment364249> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it'sÂ not about Apple hardware or software as described in the [help/on-topic]. <comment367606> @fsb a screen and battery is part of hardware so I really don't understand why you hating on my question... <comment367649> It's an 'explicit unlicensed use of the product' as described in the [help] which makes it off-topic.  I even gave you a link to the relevant part of the Help Center.  I'm not 'hating on you (sic) question', I'm helping you understand the guidelines of this site.
