Use applications as video sources for apps like Skype? <body> Is there a solution out there that can screen record 1 application and "stream" it through a fake virtual camera, so the video can be sent live through apps like Skype?  Just wondering if it's possible to, for example, stream a video playing in VLC/QuickTime through Skype, and be able to keep that video going through Skype even when I am doing other things on the computer.
