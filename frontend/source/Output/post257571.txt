Double-click is acting like triple-click <body> Expected behaviour is that double-click selects a word, and a further click selects the entire line.  All of a sudden double-clicking is selecting the entire line, and there seems to be no way (short of manually dragging) to select a single word.  I just noticed this problem after rebooting, after updating my Razer driver software.  So clearly the driver software has knocked it out, but I have no idea how, or how to fix it, short of removing the software.  EDIT: I have uninstalled the software (using the UnInstaller in Applications/Utilities) and restarted the machine, and this appears to have solved it.  Not sure if both steps were necessary.
