Does Apple support DDC/CI for  3rd party displays via Apple's Thunderbolt to DVI adapter <body> I had a Dell 21.5" monitor, which was previously connected to a Windows PC via its DVI port, which has no problem with DDC/CI which allowed me to control brightness and Contrast of the attached display via Windows.  My question is: through Apple's adapter, can I control a non-Apple display within System Preferences?  <answer71822> I wish it were possible too, but the short answer is no, you can't use System Preferences to control the brightness of an external display via DDC/CI.  It might be feasible to write a program that can adjust the brightness of your external display, but it's by no means a sure thing. Read on if you want the gory details…  hr  After doing a fair bit of research, I'm pretty sure that Apple doesn't use DDC/CI to control the brightness of displays, either internal or external.  ol liThe brightness of Apple Cinema Displays can only be adjusted when the USB interface is plugged in. With DDC/CI this would not be necessary./li liApple provides (though apparently does not document) an interface to display brightness through their IOKit library, specifically in ioGraphicsLib:  ul lihttp://mattdanger.net/2008/12/adjust-mac-os-x-display-brightness-from-the-terminal//li /ul  …but this interface does not seem to work reliably for external displays:  ul lihttp://njr.sabi.net/2006/06/20/setting-display-brightness-updated-tool//li /ul  ( I read up on this a few years ago and while I can't now find a supporting link, I seem to recall that display brightness (at least for internal displays) may be delegated to Apple's System Management Controller (SMC), which has responsibility for all power-related functions: fan speed, monitoring battery level, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple had implemented their own I²C control interface between the SMC and the internal display - but this is pure speculation on my part. )/li liIt is possible to communicate with/control external displays using DDC/CI and custom software, but support for this has been broken more than once in the OS X era. DDC/CI support is also dependent on the graphics chipset and drivers used.  From http://update.necdisplay.com/spectraview/readmemac_v1_1_12_1.html:     As of Mac OS 10.8.0, support for monitor connunications[sic] via   DDC/CI is not functioning on some Macs, including systems with DVI   video outputs, and when using a miniDisplayPort to DVI cable or   adapter. NEC is working with Apple to fix this issue in a future Mac   OS update. /li liDDC/CI works over I²C. Apple's IOKit library includes an I²C interface which should make it possible to write a display control program, but there are a few reports that this does not work reliably (specifically, values can be written to the monitor but not read, so you can't tell what the current brightness is):  ul lihttp://lists.apple.com/archives/colorsync-users/2011/Feb/msg00026.html/li lihttp://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2012/Jul/msg00019.html/li lihttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/11561623/i2c-communication-in-iokit-on-mac-os-x/li /ul/li /ol  So that's about the size of it, as far as I can tell.  If you are (or you know) an Objective-C developer, I did find a project on GitHub that you could have a look at tinkering with – however as mentioned above, even assuming the code is OK, it might not work for your combination of monitor, Mac and display drivers.  <answer72890> Disclaimer: I compiled this app myself(although I'm not the author). strongIt may freeze your machine./strong  You can also try this app: https://github.com/superduper/BrightnessMenulet, though it allows to adjust brightness only on main display(one where menu bar appears).   I've tested it on my MacBook Pro + Dell U2412M, worked fine.   <answer192315> Apple emsoftware/em doesn't support any means to control PC monitors beyond sleeping them.  The hardware adapters will pass DDC commands through if you can send them by other means.  I use many DisplayPort/Thunderbolt to DVI adapters as well as USB-to-VGA with my ddcctl program.  Try running codeddcctl -d 1 -b ?/code to test whether your 1st monitor's brightness can be polled.  Then to increase the 1st monitor's brightness by 5 "ticks" (the scale varies from monitor mfg/model):  precode$ ddcctl -d 1 -b ? -b 5+ 2015-06-19 11:46:14.081 ddcctl[39871:4302046] I: found 2 displays 2015-06-19 11:46:14.081 ddcctl[39871:4302046] I: polling display 1's EDID 2015-06-19 11:46:14.102 ddcctl[39871:4302046] I: got edid.name: LG ULTRAWIDE 2015-06-19 11:46:14.103 ddcctl[39871:4302046] D: command arg-pair: d: 1 2015-06-19 11:46:14.103 ddcctl[39871:4302046] D: command arg-pair: b: 5+ 2015-06-19 11:46:15.108 ddcctl[39871:4302046] D: querying VCP control: #16 =? 2015-06-19 11:46:15.212 ddcctl[39871:4302046] I: VCP control #16 = current: 42, max: 100 2015-06-19 11:46:15.213 ddcctl[39871:4302046] D: relative setting: 42 + 5 = 47 2015-06-19 11:46:15.213 ddcctl[39871:4302046] D: setting VCP control #16 =&gt; 47 /code/pre  <answer228347> I have a Thunderbolt monitor and Macbook Air. By using CTRL-F1 and CTRL-F2 the monitor's brightness can be adjusted.  <comment70365> For me, a similar setup does not enables me to control the brightness. <comment70366> @MaxRied wow, that's encouraging LOL <comment70396> Is DDC/CI listed as a feature on your Dell Display? <comment70433> @MrDaniel Yes, it is listed as a feature. <comment83546> I appreciate the gory details. Thanks for doing so much organizing and link curation on this. <comment91082> Looks promising, but for the record nothing happens when I launch it on OSX 10.7.5 on MBP '12 with a HP ZR2440w over Mini Displayport. <comment95439> Doesn't do anything for me either. Doesn't even appear in menubar. 10.7.4. @Victor -- what OS are you running? <comment110470> Unfortunately this froze up my machine (mini, 10.8.current, dell 24" monitor via displayport). <comment113440> Thank you so much for the github project who worked amazingly well! I’ve looked this for years! I’ve got a Dell u2311h on a 2011 MacBook Pro with OS X 10.8.4. <comment136678> This froze my Mac. No offense, but I suggest any future reader take extreme caution when trying this out. It's not malicious of course, but save your work before opening this. <comment200700> Any news on this? <comment201303> @user53454 -- How did you get it to work? <comment233253> Worked like a charm, Thanks a lot <comment268860> My hackintosh is running on Intel HD 4000 and a Dell 24 monitor (DVI) and a Phillips 24-inch monitor (HDMI). On Windows I know an application that can change the brightness of both of the two monitors, so it must be possible to do so. I tried this app, but the problem is, it only controlled the Dell monitor. Probably not designed in the multi-monitor in mind. <comment270420> This is awesome. Thanks so much. <comment270421> Thanks! I do need to reiterate the warnings though, ddcctl (and other ddc apps) can crash OSX, don't use it with unsaved work. <comment270434> I like to keep my monitor at 0 brightness (super dim), but when people come and look at my screen they get annoyed by this, so now I have a way to easily bump to maximum for them. I used automator to make a `MaximumBrightness.app` (and a minimum one, too). <comment290018> Sorry, how do I install this? I downloaded zip from github, unzipped, and did a `make install` from within that folder, but it throws up a bunch of errors: http://pastebin.com/aLpjLhdH <comment290019> UPDATE: it does work despite the warnings. <comment298279> Note for display link users, the execution of the app will freeze the displays and you'll have to forze reboot :(
