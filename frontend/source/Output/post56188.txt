Google Earth coordinates and Aperture place <body> I'd like to geo-tag some already-imported photos in Aperture.  To get the correct location, I'm using Google Earth. However, when I copy/paste the coordinates into Aperture Places, the maps shows a completely different location.  Here's an example. The coordinate is  precode4째15'13.02" N 118째38'00.54" E /code/pre  I use this converter to get a LatLon coordinate  precode04.2536167째, 118.6334833째 /code/pre  but when I paste this value in Aperture, the Place doesn't match on the map. The location seems to be correct, because when I use this in Google Maps it shows the same point.  Any hint on geolocating a photo in Aperture?  <answer60645> An applescript to take care of this:  http://www.underdoug.ca/2012/08/13/geotagging-with-google-earth-and-aperture/
