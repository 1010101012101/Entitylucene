Changing OS X account login image <body> I tried to change the my login account picture.  But the options that are there are only default, recent and camera and no option for edit.  I am left with no options to select picture from any files other than take a picture of myself with the camera or use the default pictures or use the recent picture used from the default.    Anyone got any idea?  It sucks.  <answer194072> If the options of Defaults, Recents, Photo Stream, Faces, Camera &amp; Linked are simply not sufficient, there's always the option of simply dragging any new picture straight on top of your existing picture, or into Recents…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g6CQX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment231381> We can't see the screen shot… it's still on your computer. Post it to imgur or flickr etc & paste the link here. Someone with the necessary rep can  inline it for you.
