Device name in Mac Terminal is a random person's iPhone? <body> I was in terminal today and noticed this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pS5Ln.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Jeremys-Iphone: I have no idea who Jeremy is or have a friend named Jeremy.   Do you know what this means, and how this might have happened?  Thanks!  <answer175998> Check your code$PS/code environment variable for setting prompt:  precodeecho $PS1 /code/pre  It might be  precode"\h:\W \u$ " /code/pre  If so, your computer name is changed and you can edit it. If not, change it to that form by editing code~/.bash_profile/code  Also check that you are really on your Mac and not on an iPhone by this command:  precodeuname -m /code/pre  It should be codex86_64/code and not codeiPhone.../code  <comment207676> It is probably a DHCP-supplied hostname. What probably happened is that the DHCP server had a hostname cached for your IP/MAC in some weird way that had the iPhone's hostname in cache and applied it to your Mac when it requested a lease form the DHCP server.  You can check your computer's actual name in:  System Preferences - Sharing - Computer Name <comment207683> You're right, the guy who set up the Internet in the office is named Jeremy. I thought I was hacked... awkward.
