How can I download apps or updates again? <body> My iPhone storage was full, due to huge videos on the device.  I tried to update an app. The update first appeared instantly complete (a full circle) but stuck at that point.   So, I clicked the circle and the icon changed, allowing me to download it again.  I, then, clicked on the icon to download it again. Now, it's still stuck, but at zero.  So, I freed up storage on the device. However, instead of doing it from the phone, I deleted some videos from my PC, while the phone was connected.  Now, I still can't download anything from the App store, even though there is space.  My internet connection is fine on the phone, and I can download other files.  Could it just be that the App store downloads are inaccessible today in my country? The App store itself appears fine - I can search for applications through the store, so it appears that connectivity isn't an issue, unless only the specific update/download services are down.  To add more variables to the mix, I also updated to the latest version of iOS today after a long time.  I already tried:  ol liCancelling and re-starting the updates and app downloads./li liRe-booting my phone./li liDeleting an app on the phone (in case it's a bug and the storage value isn't refreshed - however improbable that sounds)/li /ol  I do not know how to clear my storage caches.  Note that the phone doesn't give an error - it doesn't say that there isn't enough storage.  Is there anything else I can do?  <comment309668> You may want to restore your phone as a new phone and then reinstall all of your apps.  If this is an option, let me know and I'll post the details in the answer field. <comment309669> You are asking an off-topic question.
