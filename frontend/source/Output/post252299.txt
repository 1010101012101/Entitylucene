Get Swift Playgrounds back? iOS 10 GM Warning <body> I just updated to the final release of iOS 10.0.1 on iPad Pro 12.9 inch  Swift Playgrounds is gone, and it's not in the App Store.  I've lost all my Playgrounds, I presume. No great loss.  But how do I get Swift Playgrounds back?  and... how do I warn other Swift Playground users about this?  <comment313932> It is a beta, and data loss may happen. Wait until the public release of iOS 10 and Swift Playgrounds. <comment313934> It's no longer in Beta. Full release of iOS 10 is now available (some countries), Playgrounds is not there. <comment313935> no, it's still in beta. The public release is September 13. <comment313936> What date do you think it is in parts of the world on the other side of the date line? <comment313937> that would be the 12th... <comment313938> Ok... but why have I been able to update to 10.0.1 today? <comment313942> that's still a beta.
