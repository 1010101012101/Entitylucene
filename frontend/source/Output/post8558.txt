Site Blocker for Mobile Safari Google Searches <body> Is there a way to block content scraper sites from Google searches on Mobile Safari?  I would like something like the "Personal Blocklist" now available for Google Chrome.    <answer8561> Mobile Safari does not support browser extensions, which is what powers the block list.  We may see something in the future, but you're out of luck until then.  <comment9169> Almost nothing more can be said for now... Even considering jailbreaking I doubt there's anything out there that goes that far. <comment9170> I just hope google implements it on google.com itself, at very least while we're logged in!
