How to use CTRL+W instead of CMD+W in Chrome? <body> I'm using my Caps-lock as "CTRL" on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4. On Linux and Windows I can easily close and open tabs via CTRL+W and CTRL+T.   However on Mac I have to use CMD+W and CMD+T. CTRL+W and CTRL+T doesn't work.   What can I to fix this behaviour?  <answer55517> You can customize some shortcuts in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qIlOK.png" alt=""  You could also use an application like Keyboard Mastro to assign control-W to a macro that emulates pressing command-W. But it might have a small additional delay or not work everywhere.  But it would be nearly impossible to have the shortcuts changed consistently or to use control instead of command as a modifier key everywhere in OS X.  <comment63722> The easiest fix might just be to remap caps lock to command. <comment188129> Whew. Old thread, but nonetheless, quite relevant. How does one remap the keys only in Chrome?? <comment212707> You can specify shortcuts ONLY for Chrome also, not just All Applications.
