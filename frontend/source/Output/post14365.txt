How to disable WebGL in the Chrome browser on Mac OS X <body> How does one disable Google Chrome from using WebGL on a Mac (Mac OS X 10.6)?  (There currently appears to be some sort of security advisory regarding this component.)  <answer15365> Not sure how to do this in OS X, but you may be able to do so by running chrome from terminal with the "-disable-webgl" flag.  <answer26643> Chrome lets you disable WebGL using the codeabout:flags/code page.  Type codeabout:flags/code into the URL bar and press return.  Find the codeDisable WebGL/code flag and enable it. Restart Chrome for changes to appear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2WHOP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment15700> I haven't heard of any security advisory. Do you have a source for this? <comment16683> Ditto. I've not heard of this either. <comment22302> I highly doubt it's so serious u can't take the tiny risk of just running it normally untill it's patched <comment30377> For those inquiring about the WebGL flaw, read the following: http://news.techworld.com/security/3286646/webgl-security-flaws-haunt-firefox-and-chrome/ <comment30399> +1, much nicer solution than 'disable-webgl' which doesn't disable it all of the time. <comment189387> Another good reason to disable WebGL is to conserve GPU resources for more important things like 3D rendering or 2D image editing. Why waste GPU resources on rendering web pages if there's something better they can be used for. <comment357765> Note that this switch is no longer there in current versions of Chrome.
