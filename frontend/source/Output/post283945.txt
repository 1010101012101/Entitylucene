No longer update apps or use safari <body> I recently migrated my macbook 12" to a macbook pro (touchbar). I used the migration assistant to transfer a backup from the old mac to the new one. At first all was successful apart from a slight issue with the incompatible OS version between the two machines. (I had to update before migrating)  I am running Sierra(10.12.5 (16F73)) on the new machine. I am now facing a number of issues with the machine, I would guess its a permission thing. I emthink/em but cannot be certain that strongvmware fusion/strong has something to do with the issue because it was the last program I tried to install from the old backup before seeing issues. (I had to kill the installation)  ul lisafari opens and appears to load a page, but just sits there - no matter what the url is. Chrome and Firefox work perfectly well and other programs do not have an issue getting an internet connection. /li limac store updates do not work, when I click update on an app, I see: "We could not complete your update. Unknown error"/li /ul  I noticed that the owner of my application (located at code/Library/*/code) is as follows:  codedrwxr-xr-x@   3 root          wheel    102 30 Jun  2016 Safari.app/code  ol liShould root own these applications? /li liHow can I debug this issue with safari and the app store updates? /li liAny thoughts what could cause behaviour like this? /li /ol  So far, I have tried, neither worked:  ol liRepairing disk permissions using the 'first aid' tool in disk utility./li liReinstall OS (restart, codecmd+r/code, Reinstall OS)/li /ol  Thanks  <answer284192> Thank you @IconDaemon - you comment solved it.  Step 1: Follow this link and run the terminal command.  Step 2: Restart the Mac in safe mode.   <comment358080> Create a temporary user account and see if the problem occurs in this account. Have you tried other browsers? <comment358081> only tried chrome and firefox, as mentioned above. will try a new user account now <comment358083> creating a new user accounts solves the issue with safari. so i guess this is a user level permission issue? <comment358086> Either that or a .plist file or files corruption problem. Have you cleared all the caches & cookies in Safari? Preferences  Privacy  Manage Website Data. [This page](http://osxdaily.com/2016/01/17/empty-cache-safari-mac-os-x/) can help with some of the finer details. <comment358110> thanks for your reply. interestingly when i try to remove all my cookies, they re-appear again - which is very odd. <comment358186> [This thread](https://discussions.apple.com/message/30392481#30392481) has an answer from Linc Davis with Terminal commands to reset user permissions and other stuff. BTW, have you booted the Mac into Safe mode? (Hold down Shift while booting, then let go when Apple logo appears.) <comment358191> Safari.app shouldn't be located at /Library/! Or is this just a typo? <comment358363> so my applications are located here in the terminal: `/Users/archienorman/Library` however, in finder they seem to be here: `/Applications`, however if i navigate to `/Users/archienorman/Library` in finder, i only see three applications. am i missing something?
