Change default view on removable drives <body> How can I make Finder default to "list view" whenever browsing a removable drive (and it's subfolders)?  I need it to remember this preference even after the removable drive has been ejected and then remounted.  I'm running OS X 10.9.5.  <comment213303> What kind of filesystem is on the external drive (HFS+, NTFS, FAT)? <comment213335> The external drive is Mac OS Extended (Journaled). I appreciate your help!
