Cannot change region (locale) on MBP running OS X 10.9.2 <body> I'm running OS X 10.9.2 on a MacBook Pro (Mid-2012) and cannot change its region (locale) via codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Language &amp; Region/code:  Changing it emostensibly/em works, but revisiting the preferences pane later shows the region reverted to its previous value.  In terms of what tools and apps report, the story is inconsistent:  ul licodedefaults read -g AppleLocale/code does show the NEW locale/li licodelocale/code, by contrast, shows the PREVIOUS locale/li liSimilarly, Calendar.app shows holidays from the PREVIOUS locale/li /ul  Thus, for the most part, the system behaves as if the region changes was ineffective - which is at least consistent with the preferences pane reverting to the previous value.  Here's what I've tried:  ul liReset the NVRAM/li liRepaired the disk with Disk Utility/li liBooted into single-user mode and ran codefsck -yf/code/li liCleared most caches with OnyX/li liChecked the syslog for telltale entries/li /ul  All to no avail.  Any help is appreciated.  <answer124780> Is there maybe an codeAppleLocale/code key in code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences.*.plist/code? That would override the key in code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code.  <comment145809> Can you look in the Console at the Specific time stamp and for who is changing it back. <comment145813> @Buscarì›ƒ: The only entries that changing the region seems to trigger are ones like `3/17/14 12:22:22.421 PM com.apple.time[181]: Interval maximum value is 946100000 seconds (specified value: 9223372036854775807). ` - and those also happen on machines where changing the region DOES work. Do you know what to look for specifically? <comment146381> That was indeed the problem - thank you. Any idea how the `AppleLocale` setting got in there? After deleting the `/ByHost/` version I noticed that a new incarnation reappeared later, though - fortunately - without an `AppleLocale` entry.
