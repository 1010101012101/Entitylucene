Quick Look Window - Pause video shortcut <body> Is there any keyboard shortcut to pause the video, that is being played in Quick Look Window ?  Quick Look Window launches when we click codespace bar/code on file (say a video file)  I can find the pause button at bottom left of Quick Look Window, but i have to use mouse to pause the video.  <answer296091> Yes, you can simply press this key on keyboard. Press again and video will resume.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Loos.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
