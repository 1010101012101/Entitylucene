Remove Mac maximize window left margin <body> When maximizing a Mac window with the green button, it will not maximize to full size, but have a little left margin from the left side.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vNvo0.png" alt="Window with left margin"  I guess there is no setting to change that, but that margin has to have a specific size defined. Is there any kind of terminal command I can run to decrease the left margin to 0?  I know there are apps which can position windows to any prefered position and size, but I is there a way to do it without one?  The strange thing is, that it does maximize to full size without a margin on the right screen when you've got a second display connected.  <answer148648> The 4 pixel margin is shown on the side of the screen the Dock is on.  I don't know any way to remove it other than to disable Dock:  precodelaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Dock.plist /code/pre  However that also disables Mission Control and the application switcher, and it makes full screen windows stop working.  <comment175055> Ah ok, the effect is also gone, if you're moving the Dock to the bottom. <comment175056> Sp the margin is needed as a target for your mouse to put the dock in view. If you want full screen hot the full screen arrows at top right - OSX is not Windows <comment175057> Ok, so there's a reason for the margin and it isn't a good idea to remove it anyway.
