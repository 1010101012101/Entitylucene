Added songs to iTunes can't be synced with iPhone because the format is not available <body> I've added new songs from different websites to iTunes on my PC. When I tried to sync it with my iPhone 6 it shows an error that says some songs' format are not available on the iPhone 6, and I also lost a few of my favourite songs from the mobile device. All the songs can be played on my PC with iTunes and they are all in MP3 format only.  <comment355451> It would be helpful if you could [edit] the exact wording of the error message you receive.
