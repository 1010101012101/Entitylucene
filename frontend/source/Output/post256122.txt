Launchpad failed to show app icons contained into folders <body> Randomly, my launchpad is failing to show app icons contained into folders...   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YaDss.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to fix it ?  <answer256175> I had the same problem. Until now resetting the Launchpad database worked for me.  Try:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock /code/pre  I hope it helps.  Cheers from Berlin :)  strongEDIT:/strong   Be careful, this operation will disorganised your LaunchPad  <comment349255> Ok, maybe it works, but is it possible to avoid having to set up the launchpad again from scratch? <comment353260> Didn't work for me
