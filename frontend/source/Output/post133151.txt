How to create an alias for IP address for JDBC connection? <body> I have the “db” alias in my JDBC connection specified in the Java properties file for MYSQL.  This alias does not currently work on my local computer.   I would like not to change the properties file but instead of this create the alias “db” that will work the same as IP address for JDBC connection.  Is it possible?  I am on OS X Mavericks  <answer133152> Add the alias to the file /etc/hosts with a line like this:  123.123.123.123 db  Where 123.123.123.123 should be substituted with your IP-address and db must match the name given as alias in the JDBC connection.  After editing the file, run the following command in the Terminal:  sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder  This will reload the hosts file.
