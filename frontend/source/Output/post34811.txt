Can anyone guide me in installing a driver for Epson Stylus C59 in Mac Lion? <body> I've got a new mac mini (the latest one mid-2011) and it has Lion in it. I have an old Epson Stylus C59 and would like to use it in this mac mini. However, the epson site has no installer for mac.  Has anyone come up with a workaround? Please share if you know. I know this printer is already old buy hey, it still works :)  UPDATE: I found Gutenprint http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php for Epson and the closest is Epson Stylus C50. Does anyone know if this works for Epson Stylus C59?  <answer49160> You may want to look at the following  OSX Supported Epson complete list  The closest I found that was support by OS X was Epson Stylus C60.

If not, it'll prompt you and download and install the proper drivers automatically. That's a Mac. Things just work. You no longer have to go hunting around for drivers. <comment56798> It is quite possible that you could find success by utilizing the C60 driver.
