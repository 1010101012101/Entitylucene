Install MongoDB 2.x and 3.x at the same time <body> Is it possible to install both mongodb 2.6 and 3.2 on the same Mac?  I’ve been using mongodb 3.2 (Installed with homebrew) for a while but needed to install 2.6 to support an older project.  I used codebrew install homebrew/versions/mongodb26/code and got some issues with conflicting files, which I could sort out later.  precodePossible conflicting files are: /usr/local/bin/bsondump -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/bsondump /usr/local/bin/mongo -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongo /usr/local/bin/mongod -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongod /usr/local/bin/mongodump -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongodump /usr/local/bin/mongoexport -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongoexport /usr/local/bin/mongofiles -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongofiles /usr/local/bin/mongoimport -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongoimport /usr/local/bin/mongooplog -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongooplog /usr/local/bin/mongoperf -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongoperf /usr/local/bin/mongorestore -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongorestore /usr/local/bin/mongos -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongos /usr/local/bin/mongosniff -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongosniff /usr/local/bin/mongostat -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongostat /usr/local/bin/mongotop -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongotop /code/pre  But if I try to start mongod, by running code/usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/bin/mongod/code I get the error code2016-11-15T14:26:08.132+0000 [initandlisten] exception in initAndListen: 28574 Cannot start server. Detected data files in /data/db created by storage engine 'wiredTiger'. The configured storage engine is 'mmapv1'., terminating/code.  I’ve also lost my database for 3.2, which appears to have been overwritten while installing 2.6.  Has anyone got this working?  <answer261164> this could be the need to create another folder(ex: mongodb2) dbpath for the second instance, and run it in different port(ex: 27018)  precodemongod --dbpath /usr/local/var/mongodb2 --port 27018 /code/pre  originally found on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15124610/multiple-instances-of-mongo-db-on-same-server  <answer261210> It is possible to install mongodb 2.x and 3.x at the same time - you have to rename some files and folders and modify config and plist files though. This will separate the old and the new MongoDB executables/config and the databases:  ul liUninstall any mongodb install in brew/li liTap brew versions with codebrew tap homebrew/versions/code/li liInstall mongodb 2.6.12 with codebrew install mongodb26/code/li liRename all fourteen "mongodb26" soft links in /usr/local/bin (e.g. bsondump to bsondump2, mongo to mongo2 etc)/li liRename /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf to /usr/local/etc/mongod2.conf/li liRename /usr/local/var/mongodb to /usr/local/var/mongodb2/li liRename /usr/local/var/log/mongodb to /usr/local/var/log/mongodb2/li liModify /usr/local/etc/mongod2.conf to reflect the changes above (path and dbpath) and a different port in the net section (e.g. port: 37017)/li liModify /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb26/2.6.12/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb26.plist to reflect the changes above (log directories and config file)/li liInstall mongodb codebrew install mongodb/code. This is MongoDB 3/li /ul  MongoDB 3 will be installed with the default file and folder names then. If MongoDB 2 should be your "default" Mongo DB, install mongodb first and rename everything to *3 (instead of *2). Then install mongodb26 with brew.  hr  Depending on your needs copy the plists to your LaunchAgents folder, if you want to launch either mongodb version while logging in:  precodecp /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb26/2.6.12/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb26.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ cp /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.10/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /code/pre  and load both plists:  precodelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb26.plist  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist  /code/pre  Both mongo daemons should run independently from each other at the same time (at least in my testing VM they did).  If you want to start either mongod manually don't forget to use the renamed mongod command and config file:  precodemongod2 --config /usr/local/etc/mongod2.conf #mongodb26 mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf #mongodb3 /code/pre
