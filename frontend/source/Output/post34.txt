How do I recover the administrator or root password on OS X? <body> I received a hand me down white MacBook with 10.4 on it and it automatically logs into a user account that isn't able to change much in the preference pane. How do I recover or change the administrator password?  The original owner told me to try a few passwords, none of which work to get logged in as admin.  <answer38> Boot with a Mac OS X DVD, then there's an option to change passwords.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o5Glq.jpg" alt="reset"  You can follow an how-to here.  <answer41> You can reboot into single user mode and change the password of a user with:  precodepasswd [user] /code/pre  Enter the new password twice and reboot.  <answer136> Getting admin access without the Setup Utility: another option, for the sake of completeness.  ol liBoot into single user mode by holding command-S on boot up./li liEnter code/sbin/mount -wu //code when the prompt appears to mount the filesystem/li liEnter coderm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code/li liEnter codereboot/code/li /ol  At this point, it should run the colorful little setup utility that ran when the machine was new.

Reboot <comment306> I had to use this method right now instead of mine, because I didn't have the Mac OS X DVD with me and it works perfectly ! <comment328> And if you ever want to make sure that no one can reset your password this simply, you can boot your OS X Install Disk and go to Firmware Utility and set a password.  After that, no one will be able to boot from another source without first typing the firmware password. <comment54672> Firmware passwords can be reset if you have physical access to the machine, so don't put all your faith in using those to secure your data.
