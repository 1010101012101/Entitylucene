Failed to download. Use the purchases page to try again <body> I'm having trouble downloading Asset Catalog Creator from the Mac App Store. I just purchased the app and it's failing to download. I don't know if they problem is unique to this particular app or given that there are similar questions out there for Xcode and iPhoto I'm unsure if I'm stuck in some weird App Store state. I always get the following in the Purchased tab when I try to install the app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HirGE.png" alt="mac app store purchase fail"  Not exactly great news for developers trying to make money through the Mac App Store.  I've tried deleting ~/Library/Application\ Support/App\ Store and and ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore and also logging out and back in again. I notice the Debug menu which used to be enabled via codedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true/code and which contained "App Store Reset" functionality has now gone so that is not a solution I can use as others have claimed worked in the past.  Does anybody else have any ideas that I can try?

Try again later.  <comment361385> Still not working... :/
