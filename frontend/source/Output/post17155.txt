iPad PDF bookmarking across files <body> I'm looking for a PDF reader for iPad that will allow me to make bookmarks in multiple files and to see all of those bookmarks (across all the files) in a single list.  My specific scenario is that I have several Jazz Fakebooks in pdf format and I'd like to bookmark the songs I play, which are scattered across several files, so I can jump around to them easily without having to remember which book those songs are in.  Will any of the popular apps I see recommended around (Goodreader, iAnnotate, etc?) do this?  Dropbox syncing is a plus.
