Keynote 6.6: How to fix an object to the target of a move animation? <body> I have several objects I would like to move using an animation. In a previous Keynote (09, I think), it was possible to fix an object to the end of the movement (if I recall correctly, by clicking the red square and hitting codealt/code) so that figuring out the alignment between the objects was very easy. Is it still possible to do it in Keynote 6.6?  Thanks!
