How to evoke Preview's title bar saving dialogue by shortcut? <body> emPreview/em shows the currently opened documentâ€™s name in its title bar. When hovering over this name, a arrow appears at the right. After a click, there is a dialogue where you can chance the file name, the file tags, the directory and set the file as protected. This is quite handy if you want to add a tag without opening the file's preferences from the emFinder/em view.  How can I open this dialogue using keyboard shortcuts?  Thanks for help.  <answer168179> You can use strongAutomator/strong/strongApple Script/strong for this with strongMouse Tools/strong command line app.  You can get strongMouse Tools/strong from here. It's a small tool to move mouse pointer and perform clicks.  precode[-h] return this help text [-b] coordinates are measured from bottom-left corner of the screen [-location] return the current mouse location [-x "xValue" -y "yValue"] move the mouse to the {xValue, yValue} location [-mouseSteps numSteps] move mouse in number-of-steps to the location [-leftClick] perform a mouse left-click at the current mouse location [-doubleLeftClick] perform a mouse double-click with the left mouse button [-rightClick] perform a mouse right-click at the current mouse location [-shiftKey] shift key down, useful when performing a left-click event [-commandKey] command key down, useful when performing a left-click event [-optionKey] option key down, useful when performing a left-click event [-controlKey] control key down, useful when performing a left-click event [-leftClickNoRelease] perform a mouse click and do not release the mouse click [-releaseMouse] release the mouse after using -leftClickNoRelease /code/pre  Then create an strongAutomator/strong workflow as a Service. Set "No input" as an input and "Preview" as an application. Add this strongApple Script/strong there:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Preview" to activate     delay 1     set mouseToolsPath to (path to home folder as text) &amp; "Downloads:MouseTools"     tell application "Preview"         set _b to bounds of the front window         set _x to item 1 of _b         set _y to item 2 of _b         set _width to item 3 of _b     end tell     set xpos to _x + (_width / 2)     set ypos to _y + 10     do shell script quoted form of POSIX path of mouseToolsPath &amp; " -x " &amp; (xpos as text) &amp; " -y " &amp; (ypos as text)     do shell script quoted form of POSIX path of mouseToolsPath &amp; " -leftClick"     return input end run /code/pre  In this case, my strongMouseTools/strong binary is in codeDownloads/code directory. Save it and give it a name You'll remember. Assign keyboard shortcut to this Serivce in strongPreferences.app/strong under emKeyboard/em - emShortcuts/em.  I tested this and it works for me.  <comment197304> Not a real answer, but since you mentioned adding tags, you can create a keyboard shortcut to open the Tagging Menu in Finder, see [here](http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/10/tag-files-keyboard-shortcut-mac-os-x/). <comment197309> @thee I have a similar shortcut, but I'd have to leave Preview. <comment216808> 1) Thanks for offering this hint! 2) Can this be sped up? From hitting the shortcut until execution this takes ~2.5secs for me on a rMBP 2014 with OS X 10.9.5 and MouseTools v0.5 (built: 2010-07-31). The menu bar flashes immediately, then there's a delay for 2 secs, then 0.5 for the pop-up animation (avoidable possibly only through other GUI config hack). I want to bring that 2 sec delay down to a few ms. MouseTools in CLI (Terminal) reacts fast, so I suppose Automator/Applescript causes the slowdown. <comment216809> If execution of this keyboard shortcut takes 2-3 seconds, than I'm not faster than using the mouse/trackpad. Below 1 second would be my acceptance benchmark in order to prefer the keyboard shortcut over mouse/trackpad. <comment216810> @porg Try to remove `delay 1` line in the AppleScript I posted. It waits 1s for Preview activation.
