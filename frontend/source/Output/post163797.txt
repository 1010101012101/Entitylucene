Terminal not working after Yosemite installation <body> I installed Yosemite now and after the installation the terminal is not working. It used to work before, but after installation of the new OS X on Mavericks it is no longer working. How can I resolve this?  If I open the terminal this message is shown:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeLast login: Sun Dec 28 00:42:15 on ttys000 login: /usr/local/bin/bash: No such file or directory  [Process completed] /code/pre  <answer163798> Your custom installation of codebash/code is no longer present after upgrading to Yosemite.  If you moved Homebrew aside to make the installation of Yosemite go faster, you can move it back via the Finder and things will work.  Alternatively, you can change the shell used by Terminal.app back to the system-provided codebash/code by selecting codeTerminal &gt; Preferences/code from the menu bar (this should still be available even though the Terminal window shows it failed to start) in the Terminal.app and under the codeGeneral/code tab set the codeShells open with:/code setting to codeCommand (complete path):/code and enter:  precode/bin/bash /code/pre  in to the command area like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6xPGy.png" alt="enter image description here"  This will allow you to open a Terminal window. Once this window is open I strongstrongly/strong suggest you set your default shell back to the system-provided codebash/code by running:  precodechsh -s /bin/bash /code/pre  Once you do this, you can change Terminal.app's preferences back to codeDefault login shell/code.  <answer163802> You installed another version of bash,right? The default login shell is /bin/bash. you can change it following these steps,  ol ligo to "System Preferences"  "Users &amp; Groups"/li liclick the "padlock" icon and authenticate/li liright-click the icon for your user and select "Advanced Options..."/li lichange the value for "Login shell" /li /ol  <comment191822> Did you have any trouble during the installation? That could cause it not to be copied back. You may have to reinstall homebrew completely if it doesn't work. <comment191826> Nice, concise. Go with this one OP. <comment243527> Bless you! I thought my OS was a goner...
