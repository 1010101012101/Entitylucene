Getting started with jailbroken iOS development? <body> What do I need to code on a jailbroken iOS device?  I think I've already got all of the programs that I need - Xcode 4.3 (and iOSOpenDev), the iOS 5 SDK, theos, ldid and dpkg.  <answer45970> The Cydia FAQ is probably the best source of information on this topic. See http://cydia.saurik.com/faq/developing.html. Here’s an excerpt:     Q: Where do I get started with developing for jailbroken iOS?       A: It helps to know something about developing for normal iOS. You might also check out the iPhone Dev Wiki.   The wiki it points to has several “Quick Start” articles: http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page#Quick_start  <comment52430> That links back to the iPhoneDevWiki, which is incomplete and out-dated. :/ Thanks anyway, though. <comment52431> @BenHooper You’re right; there are pages on there that mention iOS 4.3 without mentioning iOS 5. But does it really make that much of a difference? Whether you’re developing for iOS 4 or 5, it’s still the same development workflow. <comment52432> Yes, you are right that it would involve the same workflow, but when you wish to develop tweaks that target very specific parts of the iOS 5 UIKit, it does matter. <comment52433> @BenHooper Yes, but those specific parts aren’t jailbreak-specific, and are thoroughly documented by Apple, e.g. http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIKit_Framework/_index.html I’d suggest to use the iPhone Dev Wiki to get jailbreak-specific info, and use Apple’s official developer docs for everything else. Hope this helps! <comment211290> Actually there is a specific stack exchange site proposal for jailbreak development discussion. [See this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/2269/3117) and if it interests you, follow the link and add your support. <comment211291> That link links to this link: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/18154/ios-jailbreaking-development?phase=commitment&conf=1  Good to know, thanks!
