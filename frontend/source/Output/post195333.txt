I removed all fonts causing errors and restored default fonts, restarted Affinity and still I am getting:  precode/Users/me/Desktop/psd-in-question.psd  The file could not be parsed. /code/pre  I added my comment to a ticket with Affinity here, but it seems to be moderated for now as I posted the first time. I also am not missing Helvetica or Helvetica Neue as some said could cause the issue at the Affinity Photo Forum. And I removed the old beta plist as suggested in other Apple threads related to my issue:  precodecom.seriflabs.affinityphoto.beta.LSSharedFileList.plist /code/pre  from code/Users/me/Library/Preferences/code  Been following https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26072741/coretext-copyfontsforrequest-received-mig-ipc-error for clues. Could be related to a Chromium issue mentioned here, but have not been able to debug this issue in particular. And frankly tough for me to deal with.  Has anybody had this issue or this type of issue before and a solution?  <comment233165> Following https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5503208?tstart=0 I deleted the savedState data of com.seriflabs.affinityphoto and restarted and tried app again, but no joy. <comment233204> Another psd for which I was missing several fonts did open without any issues. So it does not mean there is an issue with a missing font it seems.. <comment233345> A developer with Affinity Photo has replied here https://affinity.serif.com/forum/index.php?/topic/1819-failed-to-open-psd-file-the-file-could-not-be-parsed/ saying the parsing issue has to do with the file tagging done by Photoshop and not the error I mentioned. Will send them a file to see if they can reproduce the error so I can open the file as soon as I can. The error causing the mentioned crash still remains though. <comment233683> reproducing the issue with another file made by the same CC Photoshop version is not working as of yet..
