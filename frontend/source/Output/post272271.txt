MBP Touch Bar Mirror Displays Keyboard Shorcut <body> On the new macbooks with the Touch Bar, what keyboard shortcut can be used to mirror displays?  On Macbook Pros without the touchbar, the keyboard shortcut for mirroring displays was codeCommand+F1/code. This doesn't seem to work on the new Macbook Pro with touchbar - you have to press the codeFn/code key to show the codeF1/code, codeF2/code, etc. keys, and codeFn+Command+F1/code doesn't seem to do it.  Here are my current keyboard settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mxq1G.png" alt="Keyboard settings"  <answer272274> Check out your options at System Preferences  Keyboard, under the “Keyboard” tab. There’s a checkbox there for “Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys,” and if that’s on, the keyboard shortcut will be Function-Command-F1 instead.

It even makes sense in the following way:   Assuming that you take advantage of the touch bar, and it displays the system controls instead of the function keys then strongthe hand gesture is exactly the same/strong as before when you would have pressed codeCommand-F1/code since the codeDim Brightness/code button is where codeF1/code would be:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xfDNd.png" alt="enter image description here"  The annoying thing is that if you have an application-aware touch bar configuration, then you have to bring up the system controls touch bar configuration first.   This is why, in some cases, the Display Menu (in the App Store) which adds a status item in your menu bar (and includes a Mirror Screen choice) is a good option.   <comment342235> This doesn't work for the new macbooks (MacOS). Updated the image above with my whole Keyboard tab in System Preferences. That option doesn't exist anywhere (that I can find). <comment364052> Awesome, thanks! For future reference, this didn't work for me if I had customized the control strip (even if the `Dim Brightness` button was in the same place), I had to be using the "Default Set" configuration.
