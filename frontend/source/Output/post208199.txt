Resize display in display arrangement / actual size instead of resolution <body> I use a Full HD 24" external display besides my 15" MacBook Pro Retina, on which I use the option for most screen estate regarding the Retina display. In the display arrangement screen, the MacBook Pro is therefore a bigger rectangle than the external display. Is there a way to size these rectangles regarding their "real world size" instead of resolution? I'm annoyed by my cursor teleporting vertically whenever I move from one display to another.  <answer208207> Short answer, no.   'Full HD' is actually tiny compared to the resolution of a retina screen -  1920x1080 vs 2880x1800  The Displays control panel really has no idea how embig/em the screen is, only what resolutions it is capable of.br The relationship it displays is a direct result of that - &amp; your mouse will jump according to how you set the images of the screens against each other.br The most logical method is to align the tops of the screens in the control panel, so you at least have one matching point of reference.  I have 2 identical monitors, so it's not so easy to illustrate - but you want this...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u10Xe.png" alt="enter image description here"  rather than this...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPIhM.png" alt="enter image description here"  The screen images will snap to 'sensible' locations, but you are actually free to position them any way you like, simply by dragging one of them relative to the other.  <comment251152> Thanks for your answer, that's really a shame. My setup looks similar to your first picture, with the left (MacBook) screen being a bit taller than the right one.  In real life the displays align at the bottom, but the right one is about 30% taller than the left one, which causes the cursor to jump quite some distance...
