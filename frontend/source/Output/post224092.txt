Is there any way to access the Photo Stream outside of Photos.app in El Capitan <body> This is basically a duplicate of this question, which was answered for prior versions, but whose answer is no longer applicable in El Capitan.  My question includes programmatically: if there's a programmatic / Cocoa way to access the Photo Stream contents stored (somewhere?) on your computer, then perhaps we can build a filesystem-in-userspace or similar to access them?  <answer224299> So, I've answered this for myself: strongiCloud Photo Library photos are buried in subfolders of code"~/Pictures/*.photoslibrary/Masters"/code on El Capitan!/strong  Using a codesavedSearch/code, the same approach as was popular under Yosemite and earlier, we can create a Finder folder that lists, chronologically, your Photo Stream. The XML version is here (you may have to modify some paths), or you can download my pre-compiled version instead:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAhOQ.png" alt="iCloud Photos smart-folder"  Ta-da!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbwDq.png" alt="List of iCloud Photos files in the Finder"  <comment271800> I have not heard of Apple releasing an SDK for Photostream (which is very unfortunate).
