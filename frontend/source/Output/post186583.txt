Why isn't iTunes starting on my mac? <body> I am trying to figure out why iTunes is not starting on my mac.  When I double-click on iTunes.app in the finder, I get the usual animation of the icon indicating that the app is starting, but then nothing happens.    Digging a little deeper, I see the following entries being created in the console:  precode2015-05-10 7:21:11.710 PM pkd[445]: com.apple.message.domain: com.apple.appextension.state com.apple.message.action: Uninstalled com.apple.message.name: com.apple.iTunes.today.TodayExtension-1.0 com.apple.message.reorder_direction: 0 com.apple.message.source: Apple com.apple.message.type: com.apple.widget-extension SenderMachUUID: 58242545-21FA-3D58-8722-ED1C2E256DB6  2015-05-10 7:21:11.720 PM pkd[445]: com.apple.message.domain: com.apple.appextension.state com.apple.message.action: Installed com.apple.message.name: com.apple.iTunes.today.TodayExtension-12.1.2.27 com.apple.message.reorder_direction: 0 com.apple.message.source: Apple com.apple.message.type: com.apple.widget-extension SenderMachUUID: 58242545-21FA-3D58-8722-ED1C2E256DB6 /code/pre  This pair of entries is created each time I double-click. There is no other indication that I can see on why iTunes is not starting.  I have recently re-downloaded and installed version 12.1.2 from apple and continue to have the same problem.  I am running Yosemite version 10.10.3 and I can provide any other information that may be useful. Does anyone have any ideas?  hr  strongEDIT/strong:   Logged in as emGuest User/em and experiencing the same behavior.  Other seemingly related apps (eg- iBooks, keynote, app store, photos) have no trouble opening either as the regular user or as the guest user.  <answer189828> I have a workaround. Not a fix, but something that allows me to open itunes.  I've created this bash alias:  precodealias itunes='/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes --x &amp;' /code/pre  Now, whenever I type codeitunes/code in the terminal, the application opens.  The code--x/code option is not valid AFAIK. For some reason, passing a command line option kicks iTunes to  open. When passing no parameters, iTunes does not open.  I cannot explain this behavior and would appreciate an explanation if anyone has one.  I'm going to try @Tetsujin's suggestion to see if it provides a complete fix.  <answer260293> Choose Force Quit from the Apple menu, or press Command-Option-Esc. This is similar to pressing Control-Alt-Delete on a PC. Select the unresponsive app in the Force Quit window, then click Force Quit.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLemN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment220315> The first thing I'd try is make a new user account and see if I can get iTunes to launch. Can you add that detail to your question so we can focus on system issues or user account issues? <comment220320> @bmike thanks for the suggestion. Will update the question with more info. <comment225165> This is one of those occasions I'd try running the combo updater; sometimes it fixes odd glitches - not always, but worth a try - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804? <comment225242> Thanks. I'll try this. I've gotten a workaround, but it is not a fix.  Hopefully, this will do it. <comment325823> The OP was trying to get iTunes to _start_, not force quit it. This answer has nothing to do with the question asked.
