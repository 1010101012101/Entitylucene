Can Windows Vista be installed on Mac OS X 10.6.6? <body> I heard that as of Mac OS X 10.6.6, Apple removed wording about installing Vista via Boot Camp, suggesting that they are no longer supporting it.  If I have Mac OS X 10.6.6 installed, can I still install a full version of Vista on it?  <answer6769> Yes, according to Apple's Snow Leopard Specs.     strongBoot Camp:br/strong   requires Windows XP with   Service Pack 2 or Windows Vista (sold   separately).   Also, you can install Windows 7 if you update Boot Camp. Info here.  <comment7108> As I know Apple won't support windows XP and vista in 10.6.6 bootcamp but you can install them if you want. it's just like Microsoft that didn't support windows 98 any more but you can still install this version if you want. <comment7111> Windows 7 is compatible as well. <comment7112> @mummey updated. <comment7114> The only issue I could possibly foresee is if Apple removes WinXP or Vista support from it's Boot Camp drivers. Otherwise, should be free and clear.
