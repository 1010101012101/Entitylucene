openpgp2ssh (monkeysphere tool) installed with Homebrew on OS X error Can't locate Crypt/OpenSSL/Bignum.pm in @INC <body> I am trying to install codemonkeysphere/code on an OS X machine with codeHomebrew/code:  precode$ brew install monkeysphere monkeysphere: Unsatisfied dependency: Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum Homebrew does not provide Perl dependencies; install with:   cpan -i Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum Error: An unsatisfied requirement failed this build. /code/pre  monkeysphere needs the codeCrypt::OpenSSL::Bignum/code perl module and emHomebrew/em is telling me to use the command codecpan -i Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum/code in order to install that module. After I type:  precode$ cpan -i Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum ... ... /code/pre  And install the dependency, I re-type the codebrew/code command:  precode$ brew install monkeysphere ==&gt; Downloading http://archive.monkeysphere.info/debian/pool/monkeysphere/m/monkeysphere/monkeysphere_0.36.orig.tar.gz ######################################################################## 100.0% ==&gt; Patching patching file Makefile Hunk #5 succeeded at 62 (offset 1 line).

Why doesn't it see the dependency and how can I repair this issue?  Thanks for the attention!  <answer205552> The problem was codecpan/code installed with MacPorts. I had to install the module with code$ /usr/bin/cpan -i Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum/code, specifying an absolute path for codecpan/code.  <comment247770> Just tried installing monkeysphere (had to install the Bignum module too) and openpgp2ssh works for me. If you run `brew doctor` does it find any problems with your brew install? <comment247851> Thank you for your advice, but I have just found the source of the problem. It appears that the wrong `cpan` command was issued when I installed `Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum`. It was an `/opt/local/bin/cpan` installed by MacPorts which was bound to a MacPorts' `/opt/local//bin/perl` Perl which differs from the perl used by `openpgp2ssh`. I have just installed the module with the correct `/usr/bin/cpan` using an absolute path on the command line.
