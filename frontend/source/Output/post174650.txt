Gmail tab in Safari Consumes high band width <body> I have figured a process called 'Safari networking' (I think it's the process of safari browser) consumes lots of bandwidth. It's about 1 GB in 1 hour, but I didn't download anything. I have also found that it eats bandwidth only when gmail is opened in a safari tab. If you close gmail tab, bandwidth usage  is normal.Any idea why this is happening ?  OSX Yosmite 10.10.2br Safari 8.0.3   <answer178001> I have a similar problem. Last month, on one particular day, 80GB was downloaded (and another day, almost 40GB). This was definitely not something I was downloading - I don't even have 40GB of spare disk on any computer at home!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0NOZ0.png" alt="enter image description here" After resetting router passwords (in case someone was hacking my wifi), and monitoring all my home computers, I also narrowed it down to gmail, but only on my wife's and daughters accounts. One particular email from Pintrest caused 1GB to download in a few minutes before I switched tabs and it stopped. I reopened the email, but it didn't happen a second time. Also forwarded the email to my account but the problem didn't reoccur, so I'm not sure it was related to that particular email.  It's happened about 3 times in the last month, every time in Safari (I think, but I'm not 100% sure).  Has anyone else seen this, or does anyone have any ideas as to its cause?  (All my home computers are Macs, with the latest updates applied.)  <comment205655> 1GB seems very high, but some usage would be normal as Gmail communicates with the server on a regular basis even if it's unattended.
