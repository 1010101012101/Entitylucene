What is the Aliases pane in Sparrow? <body> I've just installed Sparrow on my brand new iMac. I found the Aliases pane in Sparrow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jVQ63.jpg" alt=""  I've Googled it and found some source say it similars to Shortcut in windows.  What the Aliases pane for?     Please help guys!  <answer50926> No this is not a file alias (which is the same as a shortcut in windows) but an email alias. An email alias is an additional email address for an existing account.  You create an account with an address email@example.com and then a series of additional address for the very same account (the aliases).  You will have  ul lione account/li liseveral addresses/li /ul  It is the same principle as shortcuts and aliases for files but in another context.
