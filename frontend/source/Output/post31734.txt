.HFS+ Private Directory Data? <body> On my emfile exchange partition/em that both Mac and Ubuntu emshould/em have access to, I cannot manage to get access from Ubuntu.  This partition was created with the Disk Utility in Lion.  Unlike before, there is a file or directory called code.HFS+ Private Directory  Data?/code (including the questions mark!) This was not there the last time I create such a partition. I cannot delete this file/directory.  What is this? strongWhy can't I copy/delete files onto this partition from Ubuntu?/strong It worked the last time I created such a partition. emThis partition has journaling disabled./em  This code.HFS+ Private Directory Data?/code cannot be seen with codels -la/code in the Terminal of Mac OS!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cS5yj.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yD0Ee.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer31735> Oh well! Repairing permissions with Disk Utility did the trick...  <answer31761> ".HFS+ Private Directory Data\r" and "␀␀␀␀HFS+ Private Data" are special folders used by the HFS+ filesystem to handle hard-linked folders and files, respectively.  They're normally pretty well hidden, but apparently something went a little wrong and one of yours became visible. Don't worry about it, though -- as long as they're doing their jobs, you shouldn't need to interact with them directly.  <comment36432> It also did not have anything to do with me not being able to read/write from Ubuntu. Repairing permissions did the trick. The ``.HFS+ Private Directory Data`` entry is still there.
