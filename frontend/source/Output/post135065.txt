How to stop Connection Line from snapping to object in Keynote <body> In Keynote I am inserting multiple connection lines to a single image. As soon as I drag one end point near the image the end point of the connection line snapped onto the image.  I would like to have complete manual control over the positioning and depth of connecting lines. How do I stop Keynote from auto snapping my connection line?  <answer295751> As noted in the comments, to control the endpoints in the connecting line hold down the kbdâŒ˜/kbd while dragging the endpoint to the desired position on the object.  <comment160067> Try holding the CMD key while dragging the connection line
