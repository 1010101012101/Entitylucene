A security update locked OSX.GenieoDropper.A <body> I need to launch an app but OSX recognise it as a malware.   While launching this app, OSX says "app will damage this computer. You should eject this disk image. It contain OSX.GenieoDropper.A".  Normally, to bypass this alert, the method was to right-click the icon and select open when pushing alt, but neither this seems working, so how can I bypass this alert?  <answer226684> run codexattr -cr &lt;your.app&gt;/code   <answer226688> You will probably have to contend with Gatekeeper, XProtect and SIP to get around the protection with which OS X is confronting you.  ol liRight click and open in finder just white lists an app in Gatekeeper - in this case, you tried that and we can rule that out./li liXprotect is the name of the file Apple updates to black list known bad software and insecure versions of plug-in like flash, java and so forth./li liIf you find you cannot edit the XProtect files (even as root or using codesudo/code) - you'll need to disable SIP./li /ol  I would discourage you from disabling all three of these protections and instead rip out the offending libraries from the app in question or get it updated from the vendor/source.  That being said - have at learning and removing the protections one by one and maybe check your backups if you aren't doing this on a throw-away OS or virtual machine that you know won't cause you to lose actual work or personal data to the likely malware.  <answer226772> running      xattr -cr    will do the job   this will remove the extended file attributes (for each file from .app) and allow it to run  apple doc set for xattr: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xattr.1.html  <answer226915> Sorted: type in the terminal  codexattr -d com.apple.quarantine/code  leave a space after "quarantine" and then drag &amp; drop the .app file.  Then press Return...et voila'!  The code-cr/code flag is for operating systems before (and including) Mavericks. For newer operating systems (Yosemite &amp; El Capitan) you must specify the flag code-d/code along with the attribute (codecom.apple.quarantine/code) you wish to remove.  <comment275214> How certain are you that it's a false positive? <comment275215> I have old "similar app" which I've already used correctly and now are locked too, so seems Apple decided to lock all the category. <comment275217> And app is locked because of OSX.GenieoDropper.A , which is a common component of a "particular kind of apps" which, compressively, Apple should hate... <comment275259> Which applications are being blocked by this? <comment275281> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed. <comment275295> In XProtect I've found a "com.genie.safari", but it's an Extension. Do you think that removing this item from extensions array will solve my issue? <comment275549> "option -c not recognized" <comment275550> @AlistairMcMillan mainly hacks and keygens. <comment275554> Given that keygens are notorious for being infected with malware are you certain this is a false positive by Apple? Have you tried scanning it with another tool that checks for malware? Or submitting to http://virustotal.com to get a consensus opinion? <comment275558> I didn't knew about virustotal.com; I tried it and it gave me a 0/53, so my file should be clean and this issue is all only about Apple, right? <comment275590> Open Terminal and Run: **xattr -d com.apple.quarantine {Your App Path}** Works like a charm.
