What are the software for translation on Mac? <body> I want to translate a long text and I am looking for a software that shows the text and the translation I write at the same time, in two windows and with possibly a synchronization. Does it exist? Otherwise, what are the existing softwares and what do they do ?  hr  PS: I want to translate a 250 page book... I am not looking for a software that does the translation, but for an nice interface where I can do the translation.  <answer131208> I've used http://www.acetools.net/ and it works pretty good.   It has pretty basic text editing.   Also Microsoft Word can translate up to 400 words at a time via its reference tools.  <answer131218> If you are asking about professional translation tools (rather than machine transation sites), there is a useful survey that includes some for Mac at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation  Also can ask on the list devoted to Mac pro translators  https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MacLingua/info  (Relying on machine translation inevitably involves substantial risks of potentially embarassing errors, I recommend that the results should always be edited by a pro or native speaker)  <answer232967> I find that Google Translate, free online at https://translate.google.com/ is the best I have used.    <comment154059> Have you tried https://translate.google.com ? <comment154121> I want to translate a 250 page book...
