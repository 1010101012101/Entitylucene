How to view progress when encrypting a disk? <body> Mountain Lion allows one to encrypt any disk by right-clicking on the disk in the Finder and selecting Encrypt  from the contextual menu.  Is there anyway to check on the progress of this encryption process?  <answer60729> Open up the Terminal and enter the command:  precodediskutil cs list /code/pre  You will see an output listing at least one emLogical Volume Group/em, with a emLogical Volume Family/em and emLogical Volume/em nested below.  There is be a codeConversion Status/code item in the Volume Family entry that will tell you if it's converting to an encrypted volume or not, and for a progress indicator, look under the Logical Volume entry for codeSize (Total)/code and codeSize (Converted)/code entries, to see how many GB have been converted so far.  h3During encryption:/h3  precodeEncryption Status:           Unlocked     Encryption Type:         AES-XTS     Conversion Status:       Converting     Conversion Direction:    forward     Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes     Fully Secure:            No     Passphrase Required:     Yes  Disk:                       disk6     Status:                  Online     Size (Total):            569869340672 B (569.9 GB)     Size (Converted):        231454277632 B (231.5 GB)     Revertible:              Yes (unlock and decryption required)     LV Name:                 Heap     Volume Name:             Heap     Content Hint:            Apple_HFS /code/pre  h3Encryption completed:/h3  precodeEncryption Status:           Unlocked     Encryption Type:         AES-XTS     Conversion Status:       Complete     Conversion Direction:    -none-     Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes     Fully Secure:            Yes     Passphrase Required:     Yes  Disk:                       disk6     Status:                  Online     Size (Total):            569869340672 B (569.9 GB)     Size (Converted):        -none-     Revertible:              Yes (unlock and decryption required)     LV Name:                 Heap     Volume Name:             Heap     Content Hint:            Apple_HFS /code/pre  The actual Terminal output is nested and longer. Here, only the most important information is listed.  hr  Apparently decrypting an external disk is very slow (or even paused) if you use a laptop which is running on batteries. So always make sure to plug it into mains power when performing this operation.  <answer212920> On OS X 10.11.1 the output codediskutil cs list/code shows encryption progress as:  …  precode+-- Logical Volume Group 19B060CE-52A6-4102-9F3D-E6108BD91316     =========================================================     Name:         My harddrive     Status:       Online     Size:         499113885696 B (499.1 GB)     Free Space:   18972672 B (19.0 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 3F2AE785-3A81-45E2-9A3B-93BA762C0AD2     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk5s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     499113885696 B (499.1 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family E4B845E2-2294-4F26-89B5-25ADE02747D2         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         AES-XTS         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Conversion Status:       Converting (forward)         High Level Queries:      Not Fully Secure         |                        Passphrase Required         |                        Accepts New Users         |                        Has Visible Users         |                        Has Volume Key         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 58EA9B33-CD1A-49F7-A596-E2C5ED6E24B5             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk6             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          498742591488 B (498.7 GB)             Conversion Progress:   2%             Revertible:            Yes (unlock and decryption required)             LV Name:               My harddrive             Volume Name:           My harddrive             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  …  For easier viewing use codediskutil cs list | grep Conversion/code to only show the line with the progress.  <answer234053> Just as an extra note to the existing answers, I ran this through codegrep/code to get a concise answer to each conversion.  precodediskutil cs list | grep -e "Conversion" -e "Volume Name" /code/pre  The result was:  precode|       Conversion Status:       Converting (forward) |           Conversion Progress:   71% |           Volume Name:           Macintosh HD         Conversion Status:       Converting (forward)             Conversion Progress:   4%             Volume Name:           Data /code/pre  <answer235302> i like to do it this way.  precodewhile true; do diskutil cs list | grep 'Conversion Progress' ; sleep 30; done /code/pre  will print out an updated progress every 30 seconds so you can just leave it running and glance over and instantly see where the progress is up to without having to run the command again.  <answer246668> I combined the two answers by Nick Bedford and Owlyfool to produce this:  precodewatch -n 5 "diskutil cs list | grep -e Conversion -e Volume\ Name" /code/pre  You'll need the linux "watch" command for this. This runs the command by Nick every 5 seconds to give you an update, without scrolling the terminal a whole lot. Also shows a nice timestamp.

From this File Vault question I also learnt that:  precodefdesetup status /code/pre  gives truncated output:  precodeFileVault is Off. Decryption in progress: Percent completed = 20.58 /code/pre  (OS Sierra 10.12.5)  <comment98418> Would you know if it's expected that erasing a disk (formatting) with enabling encryption, and then copying 50GB of files to that shows the "Complete" state immediately when copying is done? But when doing the same for Time Machine (first erasing *and* enabling encryption), TM goes into (another?) [long lasting encryption process](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/74192/time-machine-drive-encryption-going-for-22-hours-is-it-stalled) when the first backup is complete? Both start with an empty, encrypted disk... <comment267627> Note that as soon as you tell Mac OS X you want to encrypt an external disk, it will tell you (a) that you need to reboot and (b) `diskutil` will say nothing about encryption, but that the physical volume's `Status` is `Checking`. You do *not* need to reboot: a volume eject/re-insert will work. Once you do that, `diskutil` will give you output similar to the above. <comment304691> Maybe add the info that 'watch' needs to be installed first - see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/23370705/1510754 <comment305780> Owh, haha, coming from Linux I didn't even realize I installed this myself and it was not system provided. <comment310543> I added some functionality to estimate how long the process will take: https://gist.github.com/lukasbesch/d579c5670ea81d1064cc8f3d5e796a9d
