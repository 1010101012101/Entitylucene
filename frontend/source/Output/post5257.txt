history of version / price changes for itunes apps <body> I'm looking to get "app activity" type information from pages like these. http://appshopper.com/social-networking/tweetee  only that I want to be able to get such information via strong"Appid"/strong that apple used for each app on the appstore. anyone have any ideas on how I might do that?  <answer5295> AppShopper does this.  I don't know the answer but you could ask them if there's a way!  <comment9521> I don't understand your reference to "Appid". Are you able to clarify a bit more? <comment11312> +1 Their search results for app ids (the number between `…/id` and `?mt=…` in iTunes URLs) for a few iOS and Mac apps all seem to bring up their link for the app in question. The price and update history is in the “App Activity” sidebar on the right.
