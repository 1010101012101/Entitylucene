Activation Lock on my own Apple iphone 5s only owner <body> I have an iphone and it was set up when the iphone 5S came out. I am the phone's only owner and on Christmas eve 2016 a message came up without warning on the screen asking for my Apple ID and password used when it was first setup.  The password has been changed since it was first setup, so I couldn't remember the original password from years ago and subsequently entered the wrong password. It has now shut me out of my own device with an Activation Lock on it. My ID has been disabled and I cannot access my own data! How can I fix my iphone so that I can use it again? there isn't even an option of entering your email to reset! I have also gone to the Apple website which asks for another trusted phone number to be able to reset the password, I have entered that and apparently this can take a few days. Is there any other way, why is my data held hostage by Apple?
