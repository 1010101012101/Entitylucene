Random sale ad in Calendar <body> This morning when I opened by computer, I saw a notification for an event that I never created.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yp1eT.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have not linked my email address on macbook and I'm not even from US. So why is there an event with some random website in my calendar? I checked which apps have access to calendar, and it came up empty. So is it just some harmless ad pushed by Apple or something malicious?  <answer262510> Seeing the event is unnerving but, thankfully, it is unlikely to be a virus or current problem with your MacBook.  Instead it is possible this event came from an unwanted e-mail; Mail.app on macOS and on iOS has the ability to add events discovered in your e-mails.  You can disable this feature using the steps from How to disable suggested events in Calendar on iOS and Mac:     h2How to disable Mail event suggestions on OS X/h2      Do the following on your Mac with OS X 10.11 El Capitan or later:      ol   liLaunch Mail./li   liChoose Preferences from the Mail menu./li   liClick the General tab./li   liSelect Never in the drop-down menu labeled “Add invitations to Calendar”./li   /ol   <comment328856> can we just flag all these as dupes. We're seeing half a dozen a day right now <comment328859> Of course, this is the first time I have seen this problem.
