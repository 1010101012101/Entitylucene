Trying to install CocoaPods using terminal getting command not found <body> Im trying to install CocoaPods using terminal. In their official website it is written:  precodeinstalling it is as easy as running the following commands in the terminal: $ [sudo] gem install cocoapods $ pod setup /code/pre  But when i enter the first line in terminal i get the following error:  precode-bash: $: command not found /code/pre  What can I do with it, I tried looking in the web but since I'm a noob with terminal I couldn't really figure out what to to do.  <answer108259> the $ in the lines shown is meant to represent the command prompt of the terminal.  enter the commands without the $ preceding..also the [sudo] part represents the requirement to use sudo or not (you will probably need to) so this comes down to entering  precodesudo gem install cocoapods pod setup /code/pre  before embarking further on your exploration of the command prompt you might find it helpful to have a look through some of the resources on this superuser question
