sandboxd, pstopdf deny file-read-data and file-read-metadata <body> In attempting to get cups-pdf working in El Capitan, I'm running into the error that pstopdf errors out.  The system.log shows that the sandbox kernel extension is denying read access to the following files:  precodedeny-read-data /Users/USERNAME/.CFUserTextEncoding deny-read-metadata /Users/USERNAME/Library/Fonts /code/pre  Is there a way to work-around this issue? What's the appropriate thing to do for sandboxed applications?
