Dark spot appearing on the Screen , MacBook Pro 13 <body> When screen brightness is low I get this dark spot in my screen. Is this something serious ?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F8J6l.jpg" alt="Dark spot on the MacBook screen"  <answer100031> It seems to be a dead backlight LED.   If your computer is still under AppleCare I would suggest to bring it to an Apple Store or to an Apple Premium Reseller.
