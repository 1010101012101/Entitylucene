Installation stuck at grey boot screen on Macbook Pro 4,1 (Early 2008) <body> I would appreciate any help you guys can give me since I would really like to upgrade my laptop to Mountain Lion.  Computer: Macbook Pro 17" 4,1 (Early 2008) RAM: 4 GB RAM Hard drive: 128 SSD Hard drive Video card: NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT Current OS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8  Steps I have taken but failed to properly install the OS.  ul liDowloaded Mountain Lion at least 3 times from the App store to make sure the download wasn't corrupted./li liI even tried making a Lion Bootdisk so I can install Mountain Lion on a USB drive (Install ESD.dmg)./li liI have even tried installing Lion first thinking I would take it one version at a time but gets stuck on boot screen too./li liI even changed my hard drive to a new blank SSD drive to see any difference./li liEach time I install Mountain Lion or Lion, everything is good until the installer has to restart the laptop./li listrongLaptop gets stuck at the grey boot screen with the Apple logo and the loading circle. Nothing ever happens after./strong/li liEven waited for 7 hours but no changes in the boot screen./li liI always had to use/boot to the Snow Leopard CD so I can restart the laptop back to the Snow Leopard drive./li /ul  Safeboot gives me this endless message strongem"ERROR: Firewire (OHCI) TI ID 8025 built-in: handleUnrecoverableErrorInt"/em/strong but I don't have any Firewire cable connected at all.  What can I do next?  <answer92826> Have you try a reset of the NVRAM/PRAM ?br Sometimes it fixes mystic bugs like this.  <answer92827> I'd do a quick triage to boot the Mac into single user mode to see if the boot drive / base OS is minimally functional. After that, I'd start with systematically working through the startup troubleshooting guide from Apple.  ul liOS X: Gray screen appears during startup  - http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2570/li /ul  You've clearly done many of the steps, but the order of steps is very helpful in knowing what the likely cause of the problem is. I might skip removing the SSD if you don't have a HDD - but installing a clean OS onto an external HD at that point might be a good way to rule in or out your SSD as contributing to the failure to install and boot properly.  <answer111366> I had the same exact problem on a MacBook 13″, early 2008.   After many hours, I've come to the conclusion that my FireWire port/controller is the culprit. It's damaged and it doesn't let me install Lion (and I've had problems installing CentOS 64 bits - no problems on the 32 bits version, so 64 bits architecture might be an issue too).  To properly boot Snow Leopard (without waiting 5 minutes to boot…), I even have to remove the FireWire extensions. After that, everything works fine (except the FireWire, of course).  So, I think you might have the same problem: a faulty FireWire port / controller.  <answer196220> I'm reloading the OS on a MacBookPro3,1, and was having the same issue. I inserted a cable into the FireWire 400 port and wiggled the cable (gently) and the problem went away, so it seems like it was just some junk built up on the connector...  <comment108897> Thanks for reply bmike!  Since I can only install and run Snow Leopard (10.6.8) I don't have access to a "recovery mode" thats only available in Lion/Mountain Lion, unless there is one pre-Lion?  Each time I do a Safeboot (Shift+Command+V) I get this message. "ERROR: Firewire (OHCI) TI ID 8025 built-in: handleUnrecoverableErrorInt" endlessly. It's odd because I don't have any firewire connected to the laptop or anything connected.  Heres' the steps I took w/ both normal hd & ssd  - Download Mountain Lion - Install Mountain Lion - Mountain Lion restarts laptop - Laptop gets stuck at boot screen <comment108898> Thanks I have tried that and no luck :( <comment108911> You did say that in the text - so I've edited out the reference to Recovery HD - it's Lion or later only.
