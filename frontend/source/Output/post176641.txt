Correcting GPS data using Photos <body> Really simple question: Is there a way to fix incorrect GPS data? A recent trip lead to a bunch of pictures taken in the same place getting sometimes wildly wrong coordinates appended to them (probably because the photos were taken indoors).

Import and open your photo, and toggle the "Metadata" panel on the right (typically under "Histogram") and scroll to the bottom. Next to "GPS" click the coordinates that are displayed. Drag the icon to the desired location.  <answer263619> In Apple Photos 2.0 on macOS 10.12 Sierra you can adjust locations of photos. This was not yet possible a year ago, when the question was asked.  You can also use HoudahGeo to both update the location in Photos and write the corrected GPS data to EXIF tags within the image files.

I'd like to use the official Apple tools if at all possible. <comment214119> Doesn't the new Photos app allow to edit the photo's location? <comment214223> @MatthieuNapoli the image above was taken from the new Photos app. The map pin was not editable.
