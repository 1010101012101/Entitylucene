OS X stuck at gray screen with Apple logo and wheel <body> I've recently upgraded an old MBP to Snow Leopard and it worked fine for some time. Over the weekend, however, I shut it down and won't boot up now. It's stuck in the gray screen with the Apple logo and the progress wheel.   I've researched and done the following:  ul lirestart pressing cmd+option+p+r/li lirestart pressing cmd+s and ran code/sbin/fsck -fy/code (result: HD was ok!)/li liwon't boot on safe mode - the progress bar at the bottom shows up and completes, but the gray screen with apple and wheel remains/li lirestart via verbose mode and the last line it stopped at was :      (some numbers) nvethernet::setlinkstatus: active" /li /ul  I was looking at all the lines in verbose mode and around 8 lines before the final nvethernet message was this, in case it's relevant:     launchctl: please convert the following to launchd: /etc/mach_init.d/dashboardadvisoryd.plist"
