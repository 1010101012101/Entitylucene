Can someone tell me why my macbook pro keeps crashing? 10.10.3 Mid 2012 Model <body> My mac keeps randomly crashing. I could be just browsing the internet with no other programs running and it would just crash. It literally just crashed while in the middle of this... Second time today.  strongCrash reports in order./strong  Tue Aug 11 15:13:43 2015  strong* Panic Report */strong  precodepanic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff80301fef12): "Possible memory corruption: pmap_pv_remove(0xffffff8045f9a860,0x19c9c785b000,0x40f27, 0x8000000040f27066, 0xffffff80e1b7bbf4, 0xfffffebf007392d8): null pv_list!"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2782.20.48/osfmk/i386/pmap_internal.h:768 Backtrace (CPU 2), Frame : Return Address  0xffffff80e1b7bab0 : 0xffffff803012bda1  0xffffff80e1b7bb30 : 0xffffff80301fef12  0xffffff80e1b7bc20 : 0xffffff80301ff645  0xffffff80e1b7bc80 : 0xffffff80301ad505  0xffffff80e1b7bd90 : 0xffffff80301a319c  0xffffff80e1b7bdc0 : 0xffffff803014e637  0xffffff80e1b7be00 : 0xffffff80305c1d49  0xffffff80e1b7be70 : 0xffffff80305d9572  0xffffff80e1b7bef0 : 0xffffff80305d9a47  0xffffff80e1b7bf30 : 0xffffff80301282d6  0xffffff80e1b7bf60 : 0xffffff803021843e  0xffffff80e1b7bf80 : 0xffffff8030234b3f   BSD process name corresponding to current thread: Google Chrome He  Mac OS version: 14D136  Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 14.3.0: Mon Mar 23 11:59:05 PDT 2015; root:xnu-2782.20.48~5/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: 4B3A11F4-77AA-3D27-A22D-81A1BC5B504D Kernel slide:     0x000000002fe00000 Kernel text base: 0xffffff8030000000 __HIB  text base: 0xffffff802ff00000 System model name: MacBookPro9,2 (Mac-6F01561E16C75D06)  System uptime in nanoseconds: 127346294634689 last loaded kext at 123209043165477: com.apple.filesystems.smbfs    3.0.1 (addr 0xffffff7fb2a5e000, size 389120) last unloaded kext at 124152739916206: com.apple.filesystems.cd9660 1.4.4 (addr 0xffffff7fb29f1000, size 32768) loaded kexts:    Model: MacBookPro9,2, BootROM MBP91.00D3.B08, 2 processors, Intel Core i5, 2.5 GHz, 4 GB, SMC 2.2f44 Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000, Intel HD Graphics 4000, Built-In Memory Module: BANK 0/DIMM0, 2 GB, DDR3, 1600 MHz, 0x802C, 0x384A54463235363634485A2D3147364D3120 Memory Module: BANK 1/DIMM0, 2 GB, DDR3, 1600 MHz, 0x802C, 0x384A54463235363634485A2D3147364D3120 AirPort: spairport_wireless_card_type_airport_extreme (0x14E4, 0xF5), Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (7.15.166.24.3) Bluetooth: Version 4.3.4f4 15601, 3 services, 27 devices, 1 incoming serial ports Network Service: Wi-Fi, AirPort, en1 Serial ATA Device: Samsung SSD 840 EVO 250GB, 250.06 GB Serial ATA Device: OPTIARC DVD RW AD-5970H USB Device: Hub USB Device: FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in) USB Device: Hub USB Device: Hub USB Device: Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad USB Device: IR Receiver USB Device: BRCM20702 Hub USB Device: Bluetooth USB Host Controller Thunderbolt Bus: MacBook Pro, Apple Inc., 25.1 /code/pre  hr  strongCrash #2/strong  Tue Aug 11 17:20:12 2015  strong* Panic Report */strong  precodepanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff8009c17cc2): Kernel trap at 0xffffff800990e27e, type 14=page fault, registers: CR0: 0x0000000080010033, CR2: 0xffffff812b7ee8b8, CR3: 0x00000001256a30bf, CR4: 0x00000000001626e0 RAX: 0x000000001176eec5, RBX: 0xffffff807450e400, RCX: 0xffffff807450e800, RDX: 0x0200030000030000 RSP: 0xffffff809cc93bc0, RBP: 0xffffff809cc93c30, RSI: 0xffffff807450e000, RDI: 0x000000003e0b3994 R8:  0xffffff833a259938, R9:  0xffffff812b7ee8b8, R10: 0xffffff8123ae6844, R11: 0xffffff807450e800 R12: 0xfffffea4e0628000, R13: 0xffffff807450effe, R14: 0xffffff8019ae72d0, R15: 0x000000000c001a35 RFL: 0x0000000000010202, RIP: 0xffffff800990e27e, CS:  0x0000000000000008, SS:  0x0000000000000000 Fault CR2: 0xffffff812b7ee8b8, Error code: 0x0000000000000000, Fault CPU: 0x0  Backtrace (CPU 0), Frame : Return Address 0xffffff809cc93870 : 0xffffff8009b2bda1  0xffffff809cc938f0 : 0xffffff8009c17cc2  0xffffff809cc93ab0 : 0xffffff8009c34b73  0xffffff809cc93ad0 : 0xffffff800990e27e  0xffffff809cc93c30 : 0xffffff8009b8f4e1  0xffffff809cc93ca0 : 0xffffff8009b8dff5  0xffffff809cc93cd0 : 0xffffff8009b90591  0xffffff809cc93d10 : 0xffffff8009b996ff  0xffffff809cc93f20 : 0xffffff8009c18224  0xffffff809cc93fb0 : 0xffffff8009c34a85   BSD process name corresponding to current thread: Google Drive  Mac OS version: 14D136  Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 14.3.0: Mon Mar 23 11:59:05 PDT 2015; root:xnu-2782.20.48~5/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: 4B3A11F4-77AA-3D27-A22D-81A1BC5B504D Kernel slide:     0x0000000009800000 Kernel text base: 0xffffff8009a00000 __HIB  text base: 0xffffff8009900000 System model name: MacBookPro9,2 (Mac-6F01561E16C75D06)  System uptime in nanoseconds: 6500848118676 last loaded kext at 7538807461: com.apple.filesystems.autofs    3.0 (addr 0xffffff7f8ba92000, size 45056) last unloaded kext at 101422304842: com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4331   800.20.24 (addr 0xffffff7f8b74f000, size 2043904) loaded kexts: /code/pre  Please help me try to fix this!  <answer199844> The first thing I would check would be the RAM, either swap it out for known working memory or just re-seat it.  <answer199849> I recommend you install the OS X 10.10.4 Update as it contains a significant number of fixes, especially in networking and wireless.  After that:    ul liDoes it crash if you boot into Safe Mode by holding down the Shift key immediately after startup?/li liDoes it still crash if you create a new user and log in with that account?/li liHave you booted into Recovery Mode and used Disk Utility to repair your startup disk and repair permissions on your Mac's partition?/li liHave you installed any custom fonts into Font Book or by dragging into the Fonts folder of either Library folders?  Have you tried running /li /ul     atsutil databases -remove   ul liHave you installed any Chrome extensions, and if so, have you tried disabling them?/li liDo either Safari or Firefox have any issues connecting to and rendering websites?  Does Chrome seem to crash on any specific websites, or completely randomly regardless of the site?  Do you often work with a large number of tabs open?/li liHave you tried removing Google Chrome and its preferences in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/ then installing a new .app from the latest download?  You might also find AppZapper useful./li /ul  <answer199856> Those logs show it was Google drive and Google Chrome creating the problem.  I would say nothing physically wrong with your RAM hardware, since both panic reports point to Google.   precodeBSD process name corresponding to current thread: Google Drive BSD process name corresponding to current thread: Google Chrome He /code/pre  Maybe you reinstall Google Drive (or disable it) and also reinstall Google Chrome, or try different browser.  <answer281665> 2012 Macbook Pros have known issues with their video chipset causing the computer to restart, show distorted video and no output onto an external display. This is caused by a faulty nVidia chipset used by Apple.   https://www.apple.com/au/support/macbookpro-videoissues/  Not sure if they still offer this, but they were offering to replace the motherboard for a long time, however, you should book a genius appointment to see if you are affected.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to replace the chipset with something that works, so your computer will most likely still have this problem in the months after it is fixed by Apple.   <comment240669> I will definitely try this, thanks. <comment240680> I would never advise to test memory this way: at random, and with a physical access wich may cause more damages (ESD) than fixes. Rather use a program to test it surely which will show you where the error is: http://www.memtestosx.org/ . <comment240690> In order: I only have one account and never log off; No; I have installed custom fonts. How do I run that command its telling me this on the terminal "You must run as root, use sudo in order to remove system user databases Removing: /private/var/folders/hd/nxtck33d2mn8dj697thjzwd00000gn/C/com.apple.FontRegistry"; Yes I chrome extensions. I will try the guys idea below and remove chrome related apps and reinstall.; I don't use safari or firefox and I don't usually have a lot of tabs open.;I will try that next.; I've never had any issues with the previous version I hate Yosemite... <comment240692> The crashes happen sporadically and I'll have to just wait and see when the next one will happen. I am updating my ram to 16gb because I will be using a lot of editing software and I'll need the extra speed in order to process it all. Thanks for all the suggestions. I will be trying every suggestion until it no longer crashes on me and I will be updating this page to keep you guys informed. I have already updated to 10.10.4 and re checked the ram ports. It wasn't a big deal. I've taken macbooks apart in the past, so I know my way around. <comment240810> Sorry, should've remembered that -remove requires sudo first: sudo atsutil databases -remove and then enter your administrator account's password when prompted. <comment240811> FWIW I'm not a very big of Yosemite either, but El Capitan looks really promising already.
