Terminal window is now blank <body> A Terminal newbie here.   I had downloaded and installed Git, but when I typed "Git --version" I would get illegal instruction.

I used to get the prompt "Elia$". Now I literally have a blank screen. What is a string of characters I can type in the Terminal window? I am totally new to Terminal and command lines. Thank you! <comment172563> @Elia try this: `echo "export PS1=\"\u\w$\""  ~/.bash_profile` and restart Your Terminal app. <comment172569> @MateuszSzlosek Unfortunately, I still gat a blank screen. I am typing "echo "export PS1=\"\u\w$\""  ~/.bash_profile" and hit return. Nothing is returned after I enter that command line. Thank you.
