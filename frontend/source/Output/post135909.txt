Add local file URL handling to Applescript Application <body> I am using a simple applescript application to open different URL schemes in different Fluid Apps.  By setting this app as the default browser, I can effectively parse out the URL scheme and open the appropriate stand-alone Fluid App as the browser.  Everything works perfectly, except the "share this folder..." option in Dropbox.  This opens a local URL - codefile:///var/folders/.../code  This simply does not work.  The default_browser application launches and then immediately closes.  Does anyone know how to update this script so that local file links will work?  precodeon open location this_URL  if this_URL contains "docs.google.com" then     tell application "/Applications/Fluids/Google Drive.app"         activate         open location this_URL     end tell else if this_URL contains "drive.google.com" then     tell application "/Applications/Fluids/Google Drive.app"         activate         open location this_URL     end tell else if this_URL contains "mail.google.com" then     tell application "/Applications/Fluids/Gmail.app"         activate         open location this_URL     end tell else if this_URL contains "gmail.com" then     tell application "/Applications/Fluids/Gmail.app"         activate         open location this_URL     end tell     -- default browser here else     tell application "/Applications/Google Chrome.app"         activate         open location this_URL     end tell end if end open location /code/pre  EDIT: to clarify - the Dropbox "share this folder..." option opens the default browser app (above), which then closes immediately.  <comment161141> I think the problem is that you're inside an `on open location` handler, while `this_URL` in the Dropbox-case would be recognized as a POSIX file, not a "location", though I'm not completely sure. Have you tried the above inside a `on run` event that checks whether `this_URL` contains `file://`? And what happens if you do a `display dialog` inside the `on open location` with a file-URL, does it even get catched by the event? <comment161278> You're right - display dialog doesn't even work within that event. Which leads back to my initial question which is 'how do I add local file URL handling to this app?'  Any ideas? <comment161293> So after googling' around for a bit I'm quite certain that re-routing the `file://` protocol is not possible. There's no LSHandlerURLScheme in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist` that maps this URL to the Finder - my guess is that the recognition of the `file:` protocol is deep inside the System resources and I wouldn't want to mess with that. What's the problem with the current handling of Dropbox's file URLs anyway? Where do you want to redirect this to? <comment161422> The issue is for this applescript to work with any URLs it needs to be set as the default browser.  Nothing is wrong with the typical handling - that's what I'm trying to get back to.  does that make sense?  I updated the question with more info
