Debugging "The Installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail."? <body> While trying to install a PKG installer package, I've run into an issue where it refuses to finish installing.  The PKG almost finises, but ends with the following error, and does not finish installing.     The Installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance.   The macOS version is the latest and a fresh install, and it is the latest version of the software, but I'm not particularly interested in my specific case, as I already chanced upon a workaround. I'm mostly interested in debugging why it fails to install.  Is there any way to debug a failed Installer package to find out anything about why it failed?  I tried checking Console, but didn't find anything. I also tried running codeInstaller.app/code by the command line in the hopes it would give me something to go on.  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/Installer /code/pre  Unfortunately, it just repeated the message in Terminal.  precode2017-03-10 14:02:45.426 Installer[654:7354] The Installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance. /code/pre  I was hoping to be able to find out emsomething/em more about emwhy/em it is failing. Just telling a manufacture, "it just doesn't finish installing on my machine" really doesn't seem very productive if there is no way to figure out emwhy/em.  <answer275917> Aha! It turns out the log for the installer can be found in the application menu.  kbdWindow/kbd - kbdInstaller Log/kbd (kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdL/kbd)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wecMg.png" alt="Window -&gt; Installer Log"  You may need to set the log window to kbdShow All Logs/kbd to see all the relevant information:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AlLrE.png" alt="Show All Logs"
