No input field for Apple ID Verification Code <body> I have an older iPad Mini and when I try and use a game iOS Game Center asks for my password, which I enter, and is accepted. Then it asks to type in the Apple ID Verification Code, although there is nowhere to type it in.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U3XPN.png" alt="2"  strongEDIT/strong: Thanks to fsb's suggestion the verification code was accepted by typing it directly after the password into the Game Center login password field. I'm shocked Apple would expect anyone to know to do this — it's sheer laziness on their part and ridiculously stupid.    <answer267005> According to this Apple Support page, the issue is strongtwo-factor authentication with older devices/iOS/strong.  hr/  h1What if I use two-factor authentication on a device running older software?/h1  If you use two-factor authentication with devices running older OS versions, you might be asked to add your six-digit verification code to the end of your password when signing in.   Get your verification code from a trusted device running iOS 9 and later or OS X El Capitan and later, or have it sent to your trusted phone number. Then type your password followed by the six-digit verification code directly into the password field without any spaces between the password and the verification code.  <comment334851> I am offended that Game Center even exists, but I wouldn't downvote someone for pointing out a rather stupid programming error in it.  :-) <comment334854> @WGroleau: Thank you! I'm offended by it also, unfortunately certain games won't work online apparently without it. <comment334860> I read on one of the Apple discussion threads that you can type the code into the password field, right after your password and without using any spaces.  Some posters there say it works.  I don't use Game Center but I'm assuming there's an Apple login on there somewhere. <comment334872> @fsb: It worked, thank you very much!, and please post your suggestion as an answer, for it might help others. In fact I'll even award you some bounty points — it's doubtful I would've stumbled upon that info. <comment335343> @Ill you are a person of your word! <comment335402> +1 for an answer that makes me wonder how you know this <comment336080> With a lot of two-factor authentications services it works this way. For software that does not support the input box for the verification code.
