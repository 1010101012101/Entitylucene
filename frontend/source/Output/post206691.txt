Why do crash reports only show up to iOS 8.2? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2tBn.png" alt="screencap"  There's nothing newer than iOS 8.2 shown on here although newer OSes have been released.  How do I view crash reports of iOS 8.3-iOS 9?  <comment249132> Is it possible you don't have enough users to have any crashes in the timeframe when those OS were released? <comment249134> @bmike Possibly, I've had maybe 15 crashes according to Analytics. It doesn't even show the newer OS'es though
