Automatically change settings of Terminal when in full screen <body> I often use codeemacs/code from a terminal (codeemacs -nw/code), and when comparing two files side-by-side (codeC-x 3/code) it is often useful to go into full-screen mode.  I'm using a 27" screen, so full-screen mode provides a lot of screen real estate, usually more than I need.  To counteract this, I typically increase the font size under codeTerminal-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Setings/code.  strongIs there a way to have settings -- e.g. font size -- changed automatically when going to full screen in a Terminal application?/strong  I notice that one can define a preset codeSetting/code, which can be swapped out easily, but it would be nice if it was swapped out automatically when going full screen.  <answer25718> You could try AppleScript to do something like  precodetell application "Terminal"     set zoomed of window 0 to true     set font size of window 0 to 24 end tell /code/pre  but I haven't found a way to activate fullscreen mode this way yet  <comment29325> Great idea.  I'll need to learn a little AppleScript'ing, as I'm fairly new to Mac's :).
