"open -t" vs. "open -ef" <body> the Command:  precodesyslog | tail | open -ef /code/pre  works perfectly on my osx 10.8.5 and opens the required lines from syslog in textEdit, however when I run  precodesyslog | tail | open -t /code/pre  which should open the same lines in my default text editing program I get nothing and just the lines --No lines in buffer--  I am using MacVim as my default text editor.  <answer105009> The pipe (code|/code) connect the standard output of a program to the standard input of another program. codeopen/code does not read from codestdin/codeby default but from a file given as argument. It needs the code-f/codeoption to read from the standard input.  That's why your first example work but not your second one.   codesyslog | tail | open -tf/code works well.   <comment123527> I actually just figured that out, but you beat me to the answer.  Thanks
