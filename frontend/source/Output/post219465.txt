2 Disks with the same name, how do I delete one? <body> I initially boot-camped a disk into a windows partition, and wanted to delete it. Initially I thought formatting it to free space would work, but it didn't. I tried again and accidentally formatted it to the type codeMac OS Extended/code. Problem is, that's the name of my main HD as well.  I can't even re-name/repair/verify it  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bekRP.png" alt="This is what happens when I try to verify or repair it"  I do have the logical Id's for both of them though, and know which one has which logical ID.  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group AEDB2CC4-9034-444E-A973-AD57E668F322     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         134140436480 B (134.1 GB)     Free Space:   8953856 B (9.0 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 17931EB1-83F7-458D-B2B4-497D111AE88A     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     134140436480 B (134.1 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 18F33EE2-F845-480F-B794-DB888CD06F22         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         AES-XTS         Conversion Status:       Complete         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume A3DCD237-4353-4A29-BCA2-5689B3869590             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          134140436480 B (134.1 GB)             Conversion Progress:   Complete             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  All I'm trying to do is merge the disk to my main HD.
