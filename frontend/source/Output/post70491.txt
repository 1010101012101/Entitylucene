Resizing Images with Automator into multiple sizes <body> I followed this simple guide to resize images in a batch with Automator: copy  ol licopy file to resized folder on Desktop/li liadd suffix _S (for small)/li liresize it to 25% of its original size/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZGEj.png" alt="First Workflow"  Though I want to resize into multiple sizes:  ol licopy file to resized folder on Desktop/li liadd suffix _S (for small)/li liresize it to 25% of its original size/li licopy file/li liadd suffix _M (for medium)/li liresize it to 50% of its original size/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZSWmM.png" alt="Second Workflow"  Unfortunately this results in the second resize being applied to the already resized image.  So, is there a way to reset the chain back to the original file and not the resized file?  <answer70496> The easiest way would be to re-order your workflow a bit.  Instead of making the small size first, then the medium size, make the medium size first, then create the small size from the medium.  So your workflow would look like this:  ol listrongCopy Finder Items/strong to the folder you want/li listrongAdd Text/strong to append the code_M/code/li listrongScale Images/strong to 50% (if that's the medium size you want)/li listrongCopy Finder Items/strong to make the small file/li liChange the strongAdd Text/strong action to strongReplace Text/strong, replace code_M/code with code_S/code/li listrongScale Images/strong to 50% (50% of the already scaled image will be 25% of the original)/li /ol  This is what it should look like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oPMsx.png" alt="workflow"  h1General Method Using Variables/h1  The above method works well for your particular situation, given the sizes you wanted. But if you need oddball sizes, or are doing some other action where feeding the output of the first task into the second won't work, Automator's variables can be used.  You can use the strongSet Value of Variable/strong action to store the original input in a variable, then recall it for later use with the strongGet Value of Variable/strong action.  With this method, your workflow would be:  ol listrongSet Value of Variable/strong and specify a variable name/li listrongCopy Finder Items/strong to the folder you want for the small images/li listrongAdd Text/strong to append the code_S/code/li listrongScale Images/strong to 25%/li listrongGet Value of Variable/strong with emIgnore this action's input/em checked (click the emOptions/em button on the action if you don't see this)  ul liMake sure the variable selected is the one set in step 1/li /ul/li listrongCopy Finder Items/strong to the folder for medium images/li listrongAdd Text/strong to append code_M/code/li listrongScale Images/strong to 50%/li /ol  <comment81822> Very thorough answer, thanks a lot for that. I went the variable route and it worked like a charm. What should be added though is that "Ignore this action's input" must be checked on the "Get Value of Variable" action to ignore the initial input and take the variable contents instead. unfortunately I can't vote up with my low rep =( <comment81826> Good catch on the ignore input setting. I checked that in my test workflow, but forgot to add it to the answer. I'll update it.
