How do I change the virtualbox "Host Key"? <body> I'm not using an apple keyboard and don't have a Left ⌘.  Can I change the "Host Key" to be the Right ⌘?  How?  <answer81088> You could try adding this to private.xml in KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  It might not work if you don't have a physical keyboard with a left command though.  <answer127748> This sets the host key to the right command key (VirtualBox 4.3.10):  precodeVBoxManage setextradata global GUI/Input/HostKeyCombination 54 /code/pre  The command will accept any value, but VirtualBox will not start if you supply an invalid value.  55 is the standard left command key, 61 is the right alt key.  I found the values via educated guesses (aka "playing around").  <answer143561> The GUI setting is under Preferences - Input - Virtual Machine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3AVj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer154516> There is a bug that appeared in VirtualBox 4.3.8 (maybe earlier?) that prevents the Virtualbox “Host Key” from being changed. It got fixed in VirtualBox 4.3.14. If you are using a VirtualBox version that is affected by the bug, here is a workaround:     After changing the host key, select some other configurable shortcut   (no need to change it), and then click OK.   <comment93744> thx. It's an idea;haven't tried yet as I'm holding out to see if anyone knows of a native way to do it.  Turns out it's not too critical provided I ensure that the "mini toolbar" is enabled for full-screen mode as that allows me use the mouse to get out again... (provided the guest has a working mouse). <comment165082> Your sir are awesome. Why is this not an option in the VirtualBox GUI Ill never understand.
