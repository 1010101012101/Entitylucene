Configure terminal dimensions to show as Lines x Columns <body> In my terminal, when I ask to show Dimensions (profiles - window - dimensions), it shows the dimensions as Columns x Lines, but when I use coderesize -s 25 200/code, I am actually resizing as Lines x Columns, so I would like the dimensions to display in the same way.  Is there any way to get the Dimensions in the title to appear in the same order as the parameters in coderesize -s/code?  <comment206982> I think it may be easiest to write an alias for `resize` that switches the input order ;-) <comment207124> for my home laptop, yes, but I work on about 6 different machines and don't want to have to rewrite the alias for each one!
