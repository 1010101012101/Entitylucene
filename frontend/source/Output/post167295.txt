Possible to play chess without requiring Apple ID? <body> On Mountain Lion, when I launch Chess, it automatically launches Game Center as well, asking me to sign in with my Apple ID. Can I play chess without doing that?  (ignoring the Game Center screen is not really possible, as every other click in the Chess application launches a new instance of the 'Log in' dialog box. The only way out seems to be to 'Force Quit' each application)
