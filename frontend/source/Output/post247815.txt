Cannot connect to OS X SMB server from Linux <body> I set up an SMB server on my Mac by going to System Preferences  Settings  Sharing and enabling File Sharing. Afterwards, I tried to access it from my Arch Linux laptop. It asked for my password, as I expected, and I enter my Mac's login password. The dialog keeps showing however.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vnggH.png" alt="That Pesky Dialog"  Using the terminal and entering codesmbclient -L 192.168.0.64/code yeilds the following output on both my laptop connected to the network, as well as in an Arch Linux virtual machine running on my Mac:  precode mike@ArchLinux &gt; ~ &gt; smbclient -L 192.168.0.64 smbclient: Can't load /etc/samba/smb.conf - run testparm to debug it Enter mike's password: &lt;I enter my Mac's login password here&gt; session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE /code/pre  Using PCManFM as my Linux file manager, going into codenetwork:////code shows "Windows Network". Going into there links me to codesmb:////code, which then shows "Failed to retrieve share list from server: No such file or directory"  <comment306048> Did you make sure to check the box next to your account name under "Options..." in the File Sharing tab of the Sharing prefpane? <comment306072> @JMY1000 I did try that, but it still didn't work.
