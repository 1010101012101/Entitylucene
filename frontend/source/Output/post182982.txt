Unable to use External USB and CD Drive <body> I upgraded to Yosemite, since then neither it is detecting any external USB nor CD/DVD in drive. Speaking of CDDrive, it's ejecting Disc itself again and again.  I ran codediskutil list/code aftre inserting USB and it shows:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.1 GB     disk1    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 KINGSTON                2.1 GB     disk1s1 /code/pre  Which gives impression it is mounted but it's not showing on Finder's Sidebar  strongUpdate/strong Sorted out USB Issue but for every CD it labels as emUntitled DVD/em and says it's blank.

A lot of the time, this will fix USB issues where drives/accessories are not mounting or not working as expected. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 <comment217988> seems a risky option as I m not a hardware guy  and never removed battery before.  As I mentioned, I can see USB in Hardware List. <comment217989> It says it is a DOS_FAT_32 KINGSTON ? so what is going on ? did you try another USB, with OSX  partition? <comment217990> @Buscar웃 I can't find way to read it's content as it does not show any Icon on Finder <comment217991> all USB or only that one ? a USB with OSX partition should work! <comment217992> @Buscar웃 `DOS_FAT_32 KINGSTON` one. <comment217993> Thank you, so it is only that USB not showing up in Finder. Lets try to repair permissions in your Disk utility. <comment218007> @Buscar웃, FAT32 volumes do not support permissions, so how can you fix permissions on a volume that doesn't support it? <comment218012> Correct, then try to repair it using disk utility <comment218371> @Buscar웃 Question updated
