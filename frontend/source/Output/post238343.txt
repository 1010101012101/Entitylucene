How do I access "hidden" .help files <body> Some years ago I created a Project (using Xcode 3 under OS X 10.6) and created a Help File, naming this codeMyApp.help/code in accordance with the tutorial.  Under more recent OS Apple (in its infinite wisdom) decided to make all code.help/code files packages and not display contents. You could still see the contents in codeFinder/code with codeShow Package Contents/code.  In codeEl Capitan/code the contents of code.help/code files seems to be hidden, but seemingly not in the fashion that was previously used to hide files such as code~/Library/code. (It is still possible to display Package Contents in the finished code.app/code to see these, so the intent does not seem to be to hide these from the end user.)  How do you get access to these files to modify contents and/or add new files? They are still there, and can be seen in the codeTerminal/code. codecd PathToMyApp/MyApp.help/Contents/Resources/code  Edit  I was exploring the suggestions, without much success. After some trials I rebooted and could no longer see the files in codeTerminal/code.  I have a backup to an external HDD (using codersync/code) and could see all the files when mounted on Linux. (I can also load and edit in codeBBEdit/code through a Project).  I just tried again and they were all back in codeTerminal/code.  <answer238943> I think I have solved my problem.  In codeTerminal/code I used codechflags nohidden/code on the code.help/code file and all the files now appear in codeFinder/code  <comment292271> Are you saying that if you use the commands `ls -a` or `ls -la`, these files do not appear? <comment292272> To modify the Finder to show hidden files, try the solution I posted [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/186376/hotkey-to-show-hidden-files-and-folders-in-file-open-dialog/186388#186388). <comment292273> @DavidAnderson No I can see the files in the Terminal using the command line, but not in Finder (or other apps which use normal dialog boxes). <comment292275> Alternatively, have a look at this answer I posted over [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/234328/162909) which covers files hidden by prepended `.` and `chflags`. <comment292283> For other apps which use normal dialog boxes, try [this solution](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/186376/hotkey-to-show-hidden-files-and-folders-in-file-open-dialog/186378#186378) <comment292317> Doesn't show package contents on the .help folder work? i.e. not just on the .app folder
