zsh themes loaded but not working <body> I set theme in code.zshrc/code file:   precodeZSH_THEME="random" /code/pre  And when open new tab, it shows that new theme is loaded:   precode[oh-my-zsh] Random theme '/Users/maks/.oh-my-zsh/themes/gozilla.zsh-theme' loaded... mac /code/pre  But in fact I dont see any changes in theme.  New tab again   precode[oh-my-zsh] Random theme '/Users/maks/.oh-my-zsh/themes/crunch.zsh-theme' loaded /code/pre  and again:  precode[oh-my-zsh] Random theme '/Users/maks/.oh-my-zsh/themes/tjkirch.zsh-theme' loaded... /code/pre  But still see the same theme. I have already reloaded mac, but no result. The same result in codeTerminal/code and codeiTerm/code  strongUpdate:/strong  Not all themes fails. This one works: codetrapd00r/code but with error: codeprompt_jnrowe_precmd:3: command not found: zsh_path/code. Others not working.  strongUpdate 2:/strong  codelinuxonly/code theme works too:  precode[oh-my-zsh] Random theme '/Users/maks/.oh-my-zsh/themes/linuxonly.zsh-theme' loaded... mac maks@Makss-Mac:s047-&gt;/Users/maks (0) /code/pre  but with error:  precodeCan't open perl script "/home/scp1/bin/foopath": No such file or directory /code/pre  <answer110905> Do you have your iTerm profile set to use report 256 colors?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PFAsL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer112516> Do you have a custom PS1 that is overriding the prompt from the theme you have selected?  ol liCheck you don't have any additional lines in ~/.zshrc beyond the default?  ol liBackup your .zshrc/li liDelete all lines beyond codeexport PATH=$PATH://code…/li liReload your Terminal/li /ol/li liDo you have any plugins that are messing with things?  ul liCheck ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/ for any additional plugins./li liRemove all your plugins from your ~/.zshrc and reload your Terminal./li /ul/li liCheck you don't have any additional lines in your ~/.zprofile?  precodemv ~/.zprofile ~/.zprofile-bak /code/pre  …and reload your Terminal.

But theme still is not working. <comment132172> I Deleted all lines beyond line `export PATH=$PATH:/` and themes started to work. <comment132496> +1 to counter undeserved no-comment downvote - this is a viable reason why the themes may not appear to work for some people. <comment256523> I don't use iTerm, I use the normal Terminal app. But this fixed it for me: Terminal (menu, top left)  Preferences  Profiles (tab)  (gear icon bottom left)  Restore Default Profiles
