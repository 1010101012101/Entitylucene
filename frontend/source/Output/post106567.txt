MBA trackpad and keyb not working on Windows 8.1 <body> Listen to this one folks... I have a mid-2013 MBA and thought a few months back that I'd give the new Windows a shot, so I bootcamp'd Windows 8.1 PREVIEW. Since the final 8.1 is upon us and the preview will expire I thought I'd upgrade. emLong story short I lost all my apps AND my mac partition./em Note that I'm fine with running only Windows.   What drives me nuts is that the special function keys are not working (i.e. brightness, keyboard backlight, volume, etc.) AND I don't have a right click or gestures on my trackpad... I've spent a whole day looking for answers but nothing seems to work. Heeeeelp!  strongNotes: 1./strong I am not running bootcamp anymore since Win8.1 installed afresh strong2./strong I tried to download bootcamp (v4 or v5) and it won't install strong3./strong I found drivers in the bootcamp folders but installing them does nothing  Basically what I need are the keyboard and trackpad windows drivers for my MBA...  Any ideas?
