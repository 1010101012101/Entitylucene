Preview.app Find -> Done keyboard shortcut <body> I've been able to configure a keyboard driven workflow in Preview.app using Karabiner and Keyboard-Shortcuts but there's one situation I can't seem to find a way to avoid using the mouse: codeDone/code to clear codeFind/code results.  To clarify: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E1r0f.png" alt="Figure"  Is it possible to trigger this via the keyboard? I'm on El Capitan (Preview.app version 8.1)  <answer294789> kbd Esc /kbd works for me - no Karabiner necessary.  <comment372062> I'm not sure the context in which `Esc` works for you but the result of the following steps results in nothing more than an "error" sound:  1. Search for term with `Find` (non fullscreen mode) 2. Press `Esc` <comment372063> Open pdf, hit cmd/F, type "test", hit Esc. <comment372065> Hmm. Yeah, I don't get the same results. I'm not sure how view options might affect this. My preference is to set the toolbar hidden. I found that if I unhide the toolbar, cmd/F, type "test", cmd/F, Esc will successfully close the results (without pressing cmd/F again, Esc does nothing). Strange. <comment372066> yup, needs the toolbar.
