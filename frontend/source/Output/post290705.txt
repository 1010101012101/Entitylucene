Corrupted GUID partition table on secondary hard drive <body> I have a Hackintosh computer, with a secondary hard drive installed with a bunch of data on it. I was trying to partition off part of the secondary hard drive to install Windows so I could dual boot, and I have managed to completely ruin the partition table and I'm afraid that I've lost my data. I used the Windows 10 installer to create a partition, but it did some weird stuff where it labeled my existing data partition as a recovery partition, so I ended up deleting everything that the installer did but I cannot see my old data back in OS X now. Here is the output of diskutil list:  precode/dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk1    1: DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC               1.9 TB     disk1s1  $ sudo gpt -r show disk1         start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34      409606                409640  3798935504      1  GPT part - DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC   3799345144   107683991            3907029135          32         Sec GPT table   3907029167           1         Sec GPT header $ sudo fdisk /dev/disk1 Disk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 243201/255/63 [3907029168 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE    0   0   2 - 1023 255  63 [         1 - 3907029167] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       /code/pre  disk1s1 was where my data originally was, but it is no longer recognized by Disk Utility and I cannot mount it.  Is there anything I can do to repair this, or is my data all lost?  edit: I ran fsck and it recognizes the volume type and name, so it appears that it's still there:  precodesudo fsck_hfs -fy /dev/disk1s1 Password: ** /dev/rdisk1s1    Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-285). ** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.

Is there an easy way to fix the partition?  <answer290707> ol liBoot to your OS X system/li liOpen Terminal and enter codediskutil list/code/li liEnter codesudo gpt -r show diskX/code with X the device number of your external disk found in the previous output (probably 1 - below I assume it's 1 but use the disk number found in your environment in the commands below)/li liEnter codediskutil umountDisk disk1/code/li liRemove the one and only partition:  precodesudo gpt remove -i 1 disk1 /code/pre/li liAdd the EFI parititon:  precodesudo gpt add -i 1 -b 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk1 /code/pre/li liAdd the main partition:  precodesudo gpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 3798935504 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1 /code/pre/li liVerify disk and volume:  precodediskutil verifyDisk disk1 diskutil verifyVolume disk1s2 /code/pre/li liIf you get an error in the last two steps add a comment./li /ol  <comment366961> I just I deleted all of the new partitions it made, but my old partition that was there got affected by the installer somehow because it thought it was a recovery partition. <comment366977> I assume you did take a backup BEFORE doing any of this?
