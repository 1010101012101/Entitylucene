How to update Xcode from 7.2.1 to 7.3.1 using terminal (commandline tools) <body> I just need to know if there's a way to update Xcode from 7.2.1 to 7.3.1 using terminal (command line interface)?  The reason is I updated the Xcode via Mac App Store and once it was installed, the Xcode is still showing the version as Xcode 7.2.1.  I've been searching here as well as over Google and I couldn't find any info regarding this.  <answer246357> You need upgrade the computer system!  <answer247612> Try this  precodesudo softwareupdate --list  sudo softwareupdate --install NAME /code/pre  But i would not recommend it.  <comment303683> What does the update tan in App Store Application show? <comment303692> Just make sure it is in this address: `/Applications/Xcode.app`, remove the app from your dock and open it at `/Applications/Xcode.app` then pin to dock. It might be a broken link maybe? `Cmnd+spacebar` and search for Xcode.app and see if there isn't more than 1. <comment303752> could you expand on why? <comment303753> And is there a way to do this with the command line? My App Store isn't working <comment303754> sorryï¼Œthere's no command line; How can your App Store isn't working,I never find this situation!  Last time,when I upgrade the Xcode,it tips that:you should upgrade the computer system! after i do it,it OK!
