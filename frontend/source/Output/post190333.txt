Weird Boot on iMac <body> Help would be really appreciated on this one! My Dads iMac won't boot. When it's turned on (running Yosemite) it gets stuck in the boot process and looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/zosCkwx.jpg There is no mouse pointer showing etc, just that bar stuck as shown above. I waited overnight and still it gets no further. I've listened and the disk seems Ok (no weird noises)  In addition to that I've done the following: * tried to hold alt to bring up boot options (seemingly ignored and apple logo / progress bar come up as shown)  *tried to reset pram (screen went black and rebooted, made no difference)  *tried to boot off to the original OSX discs. (Holding "c", cd spins up but seemingly just spins down and apple logo / progress bar appear as above)  *tried cmd-r for recovery (result as previous, ignored with progress bar / logo showing tried cmd-v for verbose start up same as previous. Seemingly ignored.  I'm an apple geek so usually pretty good with this stuff but I'm out of ideas. Is this a general hardware failure?  <comment225897> Did you try to do an internet recovery if the normal recovery doesn't work? <comment225900> Have you attempted Safe Mode (hold down shift at boot chime)? This should be first troubleshoot step with boot problems.
