Odd email search and sort behaviour <body> Using Mail in all previous OS I ever used, I click on an email, say from MacWorld. Then I would sort by From and all the emails from MacWorld would be right in front of me on my screen.  Now when I sort by From, I get all my email From in order, either A to Z, or Z to A -- but nothing to do with MacWorld.  What happened?
