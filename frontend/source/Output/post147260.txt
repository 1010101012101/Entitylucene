Can I use an anti-reflective/anti-dust polymer coating on a mac display? <body> I find myself constantly wiping down my monitors to get rid of dust, smudges, and fingerprints. I use cloths/wet tissues specialized for LCD monitors (as recommended in all the documentation), but it's a hassle I would rather avoid doing as I have a lot of monitors.  I was looking at this product on Amazon, which describes itself as "Glass Fiber Gloss Coat Polymer Liquid" which protects the screen against dust and smudges -- the reviews and whatnot describe people using it on various things like iphones and ipads, so I would assume it is okay, but before spraying this stuff willy-nilly on expensive electronics, I figured it was worth asking about first.  Is there any reason that a "Glass Fiber Gloss Coat Polymer Liquid" would be bad for Mac displays (iMac, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Thunderbolt Display)?
