How to convert a local unencrypted Time Machine backup to an encrypted network base dito without losing history? <body> I have a NAS with Time Machine support that I want to use instead of my locally connected Firewire disk for my backups. The current local backups are unencrypted but on the NAS I want to encrypt them.  A few months ago I spent several days on this, without success. I don't remember exactly what I did but I created encrypted spare images in several different ways, "blessing them" and then used different means to copy the current backup onto these images (drag'n'drop', cp, CpMac, ditto etc) but all attempts failed to achieve the goal described in the subject: the major problem was to retain the history and/or make TM recognize the destination volume as a TM-volume.  I will restart this process now and will update this question with the steps I try until I succeed (unless, of course, someone have a step-by-step instruction that works but I couldn't find anything like that last time I tried).
