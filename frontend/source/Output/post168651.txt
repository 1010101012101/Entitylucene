Chrome/Chromium scrolling is choppy and eats CPU <body> This problem has been around since I got my Macbook Pro Retina 2013, 13", 2.4Ghz, 16GB RAM, 256 GB SSD. Currently it's running the latest version of OS X Yosemite.  Chrome's scrolling performance can be around 15 fps, not very bad, but cannot be considered as smooth. However, while scrolling, the energy impact related to Chrome jumps up to 250. In Safari, scrolling is absolutely smooth and the energy impact is only around 50. Chromium's performance is between Chrome's and Safari's, but it has an energy impact of more than 300.  Whenever I use Hangouts in either Chrome or Chromium, the CPU fans just go crazy.  My Chrome version is 40.0.2214.91 (64-bit), the Chromium version is 38.0.2125.122 (290379).  Is this a general problem or can I solve this somehow? I saw other people using Chrome without experiencing these problems so I hope there exists a workaround. Thank you :)
