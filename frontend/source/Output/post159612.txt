Macports with Xcode CLI tools only <body> I ve installed the latest version of MacPorts and Xcode CLI tools for OS X 10.10 - I don't want download 4GB of data because I need only GCC. Everything looks fine - I can download and compile ports, except the one thing - every time when I try to install new port I get following messages:  precodeWarning: xcodebuild exists but failed to execute Warning: Xcode does not appear to be installed; most ports will likely fail to build. /code/pre  But as I said before everything works fine. Should I worry or just ignore these messages?  <answer159615> You might be lucky and ports work :)  I think the latest I saw in the mailing lists is that most ports will work. The issue is for GUIS and there other issues.  Note that Xcode for OS X 10.10 does not supply gcc, it uses clang. However this works just as well if not better.  <comment187565> Ah, sorry I forgot about clang - I am new on mac, just switched from GNU/Linux :)
