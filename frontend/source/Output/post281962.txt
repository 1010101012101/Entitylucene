Can I get an external display to have 10-bit color on a 2015 rMBP? <body> The setup is a 2015 13" Macbook Pro with Intel Iris Graphics 6100, connected via Displayport to a Dell U2711 (which is capable of 10-bit color.) The OS is Sierra.  Is there a way to get the external display to run in 10-bit color?  <comment354926> How do you know that it's currently not displaying colors in 10-bit per channel? <comment354928> System information shows pixel depth as "32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)." There is a lot of conflicting information out there but if it was in 10-bit mode, it should show 30-bit color. <comment354929> that's correct (30-bit) <comment355016> Have you tried SwitchResX? It should allow you to set your display to "billions of colors." https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q0SNd.png
