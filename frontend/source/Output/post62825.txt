iMessage buddy list <body> I want to use iMessage on Mountain Lion for my Google Talk buddies. However, the main chat window just shows recent contacts down the left bar, and not my online buddies. I can bring up a seperate window to show my online buddies by pressing kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd+kbd1/kbd but this is lame, I want it all in one screen.   Is there any setting anywhere I'm missing or do I have to return to Adium?  <answer62826> Messages  Preferences  General  Show status in menu bar.  You can see all your online buddies with this. You can even change your status or go offline.  <answer73990> Hit command 1 or go to window and click on on buddies. Should bring up the buddy list.  <comment72495> this only shows the online buddies from the recent list.. <comment72562> Nope, it shows all online buddies. <comment72603> Oh yes, it does. It doesn't show people who are away. Still, I don't like this UI at all. A chat client shouldn't hide away all the contacts. No one of your finer products Apple.. <comment80858> SO click the arrows next to the categories.  :) <comment85963> He mentioned in his question that he knew about Cmd + 1, but didn't like it opening in a new window. Are you aware of another way to bring up the buddy list, like he described?
