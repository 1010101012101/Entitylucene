How can I find the serial number of my Apple Keyboard USB on a mac programmatically from the terminal? <body> I would like to retrieve the Apple USB Keyboard's serial number from a command to use in a script.  What command can I use ?  <answer239026> I don't think you can. The information that you emcan/em get is available via System Profiler: codesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType/code, which on my Macbook returns:  precode    Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad:        Product ID: 0x0259       Vendor ID: 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.)

To my knowledge, there's no way to get the serial number through software, and it might be possible to accomplish whatever you're trying to do in an alternative manner. <comment293241> I concur with this.. I know my SN of my keyboard and tried searching for it within System Profiler and it simply wasn't reported anywhere. <comment293297> That's very funny... I can find the Serial Number ok my Internal Keyboard of my MacBook... But not for USB Keyboard ... <comment293298> SPI:      Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad:        Product ID: 0x0290       Vendor ID: 0x05ac (Apple Inc.)

I would like to receive the serial numbers by a script every day to see which changes keyboards <comment294656> Afraid you're probably out of luck then.
