Show In Playlist functionality <body> I frequently use the "Show In Playlist feature" to pick songs so I can play songs that I have not played before.  However, I have multiple copies of the same song - some are the same version, some are different renditions.    Is there a way I can select multiple songs and see all playlists that they appear on?  <comment150183> did you try renaming? <comment150231> @Buscarì›ƒ, What do I rename?
