How to add characters to the press and hold character picker in OS X Lion? <body> In OS X Lion, there is a very useful feature for people like me who need to write in multiple languages, which pops up a small menu of additional characters when you hold down a letter.  For instance, when I hold down the letter kbdE/kbd, I get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdkEj.png" alt="e"  This is great when I'm writing in French for example. However right now I need to write something in Czech; however, the Czech letter codeě/code (looks like the 3rd letter in the popup with the accent flipped) does not appear in the popup.  Is there a way to tell OS X to include Czech or other additional characters in those popups?  Note: I do strongnot/strong want to use the Czech keyboard layout; I found switching layouts for each language is somewhat unpractical.  <answer44928> The characters included in the popovers are defined in property lists inside the code/System/Library/Input\ Methods/PressAndHold.app//code bundle.  I was able to change à to y by editing code/System/Library/Input\ Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist/code and logging out and back in.  em(note the escape in "Input Method" if you're copy pasting)/em  precode&lt;key&gt;Roman-Accent-a&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Direction&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;right&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Keycaps&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;a y á â ä æ ã å ā&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Strings&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;a y á â ä æ ã å ā&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8mFCM.png" alt=""  <answer52051> My solution (for Czech):  ol liBackup code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist/code file/li liCopy code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-cs.plist/code and rename it to code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist/code/li liRemove useless characters from new code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist/code/li /ol  <answer59192> I know this is a little late, but I feel it's an important contribution: you can not only press-and-hold keys to input special characters; you can also input strongstrings of text/strong. For example, I configured my Keyboard-en.plist file so when I hold the "p" key, I can choose between my first name (which is pretty long), last name, and email address (which is also long). I feel this might be useful to some people, so this is what it looks like:  precode&lt;key&gt;Roman-Accent-p&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Direction&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;right&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Keycaps&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;p firstname lastname email&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Strings&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;p firstname lastname email&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  <answer77200> Using the info in this thread I answered the same question on MacRumors.   I made a custom .plist file specifically for Chinese Pinyin input. So I wanted to link to a plist that is created for Chinese phonetics. You can download it here.   <answer274617> If you are using strongmacOS Sierra/strong, you need to look elsewhere to change it. Here are my instructions, inspired from Custom Characters in OS X Accent Popup - George Garside:  ol liDisable System Integrity Protection as detailed in How to turn off rootless in Mac OS X El Capitan - MacWorld./li liNavigate to code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/PlugIns/PAH_Extension.appex/Contents/Resources//code in the Finder. To go to it quickly, press strong⇧⌘G/strong and paste the string in./li liFind your keyboard plist file. If you are using the English layout, you would be looking at codeKeyboard-en.plist/code and if you are using the German layout it would be codeKeyboard-de.plist/code. It could have other names as well, depending on your keyboard language./li liBack this file up by pressing strong⌘D/strong. Rename the copy you made to something with "backup" in its name./li liOpen up the original file (without backup in its name) and edit the characters you want to in. After that, save it./li liEnable System Integrity Protection as detailed in the same page as step 1./li /ol  <comment51118> How do you keep on finding these hidden gems? Are you an OS X engineer? ;) <comment51158> Wow, lots of people have been trying to figure this out since at least last July.  Thanks! <comment53068> ‘Input Methods’, ‘PressAndHold.app’…? It couldn’t have been any more obvious. <comment56301> Wow, I missed this question until now. I will be playing around to see if I can turn something like ~ into a list of my favourite Emoji or special keyboad characters :) <comment56306> @stuffe  Let us know how it goes.  I think the possibilities are enormous, e.g. http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2012/04/new-way-to-make-custom-keyboard-layouts.html <comment56491> And it goes a little something like this.... http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kyx2v.png :) <comment68224> Cool! Out of curiosity what's your first name if you don't mind sharing? Given how long it waits I'd imagine this would give me a benefit only like upwards of 10-15 chars... My names are pretty short, but it could be useful for the email. <comment68225> @houbysoft - You're right. I guess it's not that useful for my name, as mine is only 8 letters long, but for my emails which are upwards of 25 letters long each, it's very useful. <comment68226> btw, I just realized, do you know if something like this is possible on iOS? Given the small keyboards on iPhones for instance this could be very useful for those devices. <comment68235> @houbysoft - Well you might have heard of text expanders, which you can configure so for example when I type "addr", it will autocomplete my complete address. I just did a quick google search and it looks like there's an iOS text expander app. You can find it here: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textexpander/id326180690?mt=8 <comment71934> That may be simple, but I'm trying to edit the .plist but it says I don't own the file, so can't edit it... How would I go about editing the file? <comment71941> @OghmaOsiris - Could you post the specific error? <comment71942> [Link to a screen cap](http://i1058.photobucket.com/albums/t402/OghmaO/f74a73a3.png) <comment71943> @OghmaOsiris - Duplicate it, save it to your Desktop, make the desired edits, then rename it to the original (ex. "Keyboard-en-duplicate.plist" - "Keyboard-en.plist") and place delete the original file. Then place the renamed duplicate in the original directory. <comment71945> That worked, thanks! <comment73415> This answer cannot be voted up enough times. <comment107623> good idea, I only switch between one other international keyboard ATM, this will make that almost unnecessary!!! (not to mention the layout has me typing with numbers all the time…) <comment120436> It should also be mentioned that someone asked this question back in September on the cocoa-dev mailing list: http://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2011/Sep/msg00098.html (Unfortunately there were no responses!) <comment120437> I wonder if this was perhaps recently added, like in 10.7.3? <comment120438> @TomGewecke Yeah, I'm pretty sure the popup hasn't been there since 10.1... <comment160644> I've tried to use this to add squared and cubed characters for press-and-hold on 2 and 3, but I don't know the dictionary key names for the plist. I've tried `key2/key`, `keyNumber-2/key`, and `keyRoman-Accent-2/key` but none of these worked. Is there a list of possible key-names somewhere? <comment167111> @jhabbott i wanted to do the same thing and just added it under the lower case "s" for "squared". also, no need to log off / on (in Mavericks at least).  this solution is just awesome - trying to think of other things to use it for. <comment254874> It seems that this file is no longer editable in El Capitan... <comment260170> @MichieldeMare That’s because of [System Integrity Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection), a new feature in OS X v10.11 El Capitan that makes it impossible for even `root` to write to system folders. As noted in the Wikipedia article though, [it can be disabled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection#Functions). <comment265437> I've documented the full process [here](http://weblog.masukomi.org/2015/12/13/esperanto-press-and-hold-characters/) including temporarily disabling System Integrity Protection.
