How do I create a new user in Lion from the Terminal? <body> The older method of:  precodedscl . -create /Users/username /code/pre  doesn't work because code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist/code can't be found. From what I gather, OSX Lion doesn't use this method anymore.  How can I create a new user solely from the Terminal?  <answer32202> They renamed the Directory Services daemon in Lion:  precode/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist /code/pre  <comment36615> `dscl .` launches interactive mode for me. This should still work...
