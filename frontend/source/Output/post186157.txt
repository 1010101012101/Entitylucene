Dock is not working anymore <body> All of a sudden some running applications were not shown on the kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⇥/kbd on-screen list. I had to restart my MBP, running Yosemite 10.10.2.  After restarting, kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⇥/kbd was not working any more (no app shown on screen, not even the Finder) and the Dock showed some non-running apps as running (with the circle). By clicking any 'running' app the circle disappeared.  So I opened Terminal and run codekillall Dock/code.  ul liThe Dock did not restart./li likbd⌘/kbd+kbd⇥/kbd is still not working./li liRestart does not work. /li liShut-down does not work./li liSpotlight works and I can launch apps./li /ul  No apps were installed between the normal, working stage and this absurd state.  What's the problem? Any suggestion?  <answer186191> Try re-applying the 10.10.2 update, or download and install the 10.10.3 combo update and see if that fixes it. Here's the link to the combo updater:  https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US   <comment219831> Google 'Yosemite 10.10.3 combo' & use that rather than the regular delta update. On phone so no link to hand.
