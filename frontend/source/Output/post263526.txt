How do I know what iTunes credit is for? <body> So I have "2 Credits" showing on the top right of the iTunes Store screen. I've purchased music, but that hasn't changed the number of credits. Are the credits specifically to be used for certain items, if so how do I know what items?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QcBsH.png" alt="iTunes screenshot"  <answer263531> From https://discussions.apple.com/message/11510256#11510256     It means that your next two purchases of that type won't be charged to a credit card or count against a gift card balance. They are sometimes granted by the iTunes Store staff.

Did you report any problems with a purchase to them recently? They give them out for that kind of thing sometimes.

What does it say then? <comment330155> Nothing, it's not a button. <comment330157> Re: your edit, no it does not mean I can get one song. As I said in the details of my question, I've tried purchasing songs from the iTunes Store and it charges my card, the number of credits does not change.
