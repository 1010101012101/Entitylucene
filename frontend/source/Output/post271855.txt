How do I permanently expand my Mac's File > Open dialog? <body> Each time my File  Open dialog box opens, I need to drag the corner to expand it so I can see my files/folders. How can I permanently maximize this box?   I've tried holding Option and dragging the corner, I've tried pasting various strings into Terminal - nothing seems to work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ri3be.png" alt="Screenshot of my tiny File &gt; Open dialog against my large monitor"  <comment341707> At a guess, based on how Chrome typically ignores the Mac toolbox, you can get it to work on any other app, try it with Safari.
