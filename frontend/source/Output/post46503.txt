How can I view images from iPhoto in Finder? <body> On my MacBook, with 10.7.3, if I go to code~/Pictures/iPhotoLibrary/code, no images show in the Finder, though it does say "size 4.01GB". If I double click on iPhotoLibrary, iPhoto opens up — is this the only way to view images and drag files, etc? Can't I view them in Finder?  <answer46504> The iPhoto (and Aperture) library is now a strongpackage/strong — it's still a folder on disk, but in order to view its contents, you must explicitly choose File  Show Package Contents in Finder (or you can right-click on it).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CwKj8.png" alt=""  <answer98932> I found this answer helpful https://superuser.com/questions/186385/how-to-open-iphoto-library-folder-on-a-mac. Specifically "When you have an "open file" dialog (to choose files to upload, etc.) on the left there is also a media section which makes it convenient to access iPhoto photos. Pretty easy actually, no need to navigate through a package."img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VkNql.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer128997> I found another way recently where by you can simply locate the file in finder itself. I have attached some step-by step photos of how to locate them but it essentially goes like so:  ol liOpen Finder/li liGo to 'Pictures'/li liRight-click 'iPhoto Library'/li liSelect 'Show Package Contents'/li liYou will be presented with several folders /li liSelect 'Masters'/li liWithin this are folders of every year photos have been taken inbr From here you can go to every event and date, however, in a rather unfortunately awkward way /li /ol  Hopefully that helps if you are looking for another way, and more direct way, to locate files directly within finder, especially in you fancy renaming the once that you want or need.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ydfcm.png" alt="Step 1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUlFg.png" alt="Step 2" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M9Ig1.png" alt="Step 3" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n63GS.png" alt="Step 4" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YOPQq.png" alt="And you guessed it..Step 5"  <comment53157> Be aware, this isn't good practice since you're working with the original files!! Once you made a change in tha package content, you won't be able to return or revert it in any way...
