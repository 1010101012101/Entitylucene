macOS - Disk Utility: This volume can not be resized <body> I have a 3TB WD MyBook for Mac Drive. I initially created 3 partitions of which 2 are in HFS+ ("Backup", "Backup Neu") and one in exFAT ("Daten"). I only use approx. 600GB on my exFAT part. so I wanted to split it up into the exFAT part (~1TB). and the rest into another HFS+ Backup part. (~1TB). But I get the error "This volume can not be resized" as I open the partition menu in Disk Utility.  I already know why that is happening, thanks to this question.  But my question is if there is any workaround to this problem? Can I format it using a different program, an specific OS or anything else? Deleting and reformatting is not really an option for me as there are 600+ GB on the partition.  Thank you for your help!
