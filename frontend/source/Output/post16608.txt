How to run a nightly backup job on Snow Leopard Server via launchd <body> I have been trying to configure a nightly backup job on my Mac Mini server, and after a lot of Googling and digging and man-page'ing, I figured out that codelaunchd/code seemed to be the correct too, and tried setting up my own plist fil. I've come up with this (stored in code/Library/LaunchDaemons/dk.revealit.NightlyRSyncBackup.plist/code):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;dk.revealit.NightlyRSyncBackup&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;/var/root/run-rsync&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;LowPriorityIO&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Nice&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/var/root&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;false/&gt;         &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;dict&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;integer&gt;15&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Problem is, it doesn't work. I can load it with codelaunchctl/code, and it appears on codelaunchctl list/code with exit status 0. But if I check my backup files, they are not updated.  Any clues as to what I'm doing wrong (assuming my backup script works as it should)?  <answer16619> Several things come to mind:  ul liDid you wait overnight for it to run?  codelaunchctl load/code won't make it run out of sequence -- if you want to make it run at some time other than 3:15 am, use codesudo launchctl start dk.revealit.NightlyRSyncBackup/code after it's loaded./li liDoes the run-rsync script fire off any background processes, or does it do everything inline?  'Cause if the script exits and there are background processes still going, launchd thinks something has gone wrong and kills the background processes.  If you don't want it to do this, add code&lt;key&gt;AbandonProcessGroup&lt;/key&gt;&lt;true/&gt;/code to the .plist./li liDoes the script depend on PATH including any nonstandard directories (e.g. /opt/local/bin or something like that)?/li /ul  One useful debugging technique is to add something like:  precode&lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;/var/root/NightlyRSyncBackup.out&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;/var/root/NightlyRSyncBackup.err&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  to the .plist and see what shows up in those files.  <answer16635> Once answered a similiar qst, so check this first:  from the codeman lanuchctl/code     Note that per-user configuration files   (LaunchAgents) must be owned by the   user loading them. All system-wide   daemons (LaunchDaemons) must be owned   by root. Configuration files strongmust not   be group- or world-writable./strong These   restrictions are in place for security   reasons, as allowing writability to a   launchd configuration file allows one   to specify which executable will be   launched.   So, if your rsync should be stared as root  precodechown root  /Library/LaunchDaemons/your.plist  chgrp wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/your.plist  chmod 644   /Library/LaunchDaemons/your.plist /code/pre  and after these:  precodelaunchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/your.plist /code/pre  <comment19049> That was a good tip, but the ownership/permissions were okay already :) <comment19050> As it turns out, it was an issue with the SSH-key not being read properly when run via launchd. Your tip with StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath were invaluable in finding that problem, thanks :) <comment19061> two weeks old question - still not working? that's must be something really weird problem... <comment279273> What does /var/root/run-rsync contain ?
