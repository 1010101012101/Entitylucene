Apple 3TB Fusion Drive. Wrong size showing after Bootcamp partition removal <body> Today, after spending nearly 3 months without using my iMac, I decided that I should sell it to get some money. So I rebooted the iMac and launched Disk Utility in Recovery Mode and at this point the Mac started to do weird stuff.   I had a Fusion Drive (3.1 TB) with 3 partitions 1 TB each, so I removed two partitions to leave only the Macintosh HD one, but the computer froze while formatting. Then, when I rebooted the Mac by long pressing the power button the Fusion Drive appeared as a 1 TB drive with only 1 partition: Macintosh HD. So the other 2 TB disappeared.   After spending 5 hrs trying to solve this (I've tried everything that is supposed to solve my issue) I've decided that I better post a question here.   Actually, there's an update. If I go to diskutil list on terminal, the 3 TB shows on physical but on virtual only 1 TB is showing up. The other 2 are allocated to the Recovery HD.  Here is my output from codediskutil list/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ws8bk.png" alt="diskutil list"  And here's my output from codediskutil cs list/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O72x8.png" alt="diskutil cs list"  <comment315164> Please add an actual question! Do you want to restore the full Fusion drive capacity and install a new system. Or do you want to deep erase everything to sell it afterwards? <comment315198> I want to restore my full drive I don't care about info
