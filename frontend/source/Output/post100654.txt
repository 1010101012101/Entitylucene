How do I rename a Shared Photo Stream? <body> The only option in my Shared Photo Stream appears to be "Edit", which lets me add/delete photos. Can I rename the title perhaps online somewhere?  <answer100657> Go back one screen to the main Photo Stream screen. From there, tap on the blue arrow for the Shared Photo Stream you want to change, and you can edit the name, subscribers, etc.  Main screen showing the blue arrow on the right:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQ2fn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Sub-screen after tapping on the Photo Stream I want to modify:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YHR7H.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer179949> New method for iOS 7, 8, and 9:  ul liOpen the strongPhotos/strong app/li liMake sure you're on the strongiCloud Photo Sharing/strong screen (tap strongback/strong as necessary)/li liHit strongEdit/strong (top right)/li liTap on album name text from listing/li liMake your edits/li liTap strongDone/strong to save/li /ul  <comment186564> Just a note that this is out-of-date now with iOS 7 & 8. Correct method now is:  iCloud Photo Sharing - Edit (top right) - tap on album name text from listing - Make edits & hit Done <comment213448> @nickb please post this as an answer:) <comment213555> @DanielGalasko Done!
