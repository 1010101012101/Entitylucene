How to use iTerm along with the default bash terminal? <body> I want to use iTerm with my default bash terminal because there is a lot of customization that i have done to my .bash_profile and I don't want to lose it or perform all the hard work again.  <answer245332> You are mixing up a couple of things here. Note there is no such thing as bash terminal.  iTerm and Terminal are applications that start up a defined program - by default it is code/usr/bin/login/code. This program starts a shell (listed in code/etc/shells/code) by default this is code/bin/bash/code.  bash reads code~/.bash_profile/code if it is started by login (or with a code-l/code parameter), bash does not care if it is started by iTerm or Terminal. (There might be environment variables set depending on what starts bash e.g. ITERM_* from iTerm and TERM_PROGRAM by both)  iTerm and Terminal store their defaults in different places (both within code~/Library/Preferences/code) and do not write to code~/.bash*/code files.  Thus your code~/.bash_profile/code will be run by both iTerm and Terminal and will not be affected by them except if you test on certain variables  <comment302451> What makes you believe that using a different SSH client will somehow override your bash_profile? <comment302455> i thought iterm might have its own shell and installing it might not replace the original one <comment302456> what if i want to use different bash_profiles/ vimrc for terminal and iTerm? <comment302457> The shell is on the server, not the client.  The interior of a room doesn't change when you look through a different window. <comment302458> got it thanks :) <comment302465> you don;t you test on the value of TERM_PROGRAM for bash
