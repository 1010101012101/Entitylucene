Safari iPhone 6 will not load static website which is hosted on AWS <body> Currently I am encountering an issue with loading a webpage with strongMobile Safari/strong on my iPhone5. The site was just deployed with AWS (Amazon Web Services) here is the link http://www.point.plumbing   The site works perfectly when using strongSafari browser with my MBP/strong  I've done the following.   em1. Reset network settings/em  em2. Cleared my browsing cache/em  em3. Reset iPhone5/em  I know that I'm due for a software update although I'm really not really sure if that's causing the issue.   Might be something with DNS settings? Or it could be a AWS issue?   <answer178445> Looks like its working fine for me on iPhone 6 : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/baxq2.jpg" alt="iPhone 6"  <comment211333> thanks for looking that up. Wonder why it's not working for me on my iPhone5. I also tired it on a iPhone3Gs and I got it to work. Seems to be some issue with my phone. <comment211334> @BrentWhite what are you getting while trying to load the page? <comment211366> Is that a 5 or a 6? Your title says one, the question the other. [not that it should make any difference really]
