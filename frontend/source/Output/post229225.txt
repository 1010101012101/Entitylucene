Hope it will be fixed at the nearest updates.  <answer229314> I take it back in my case removing this plist solved the issue      ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist   <comment279591> can you post the recording to somewhere everyone can view it? <comment279594> What kind of mouse do you have?
