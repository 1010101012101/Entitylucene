iPhone 4 with iOS 7.1 and Oticon streamer <body> My wife has a iPhone 4 updated to i OS 7.1 and is hooked up by Bluetooth to her hearing aids.  She can hear the phone ring through the streamer and receive calls.  She can not get the alerts for messages or email to go through the streamer nor do they make a sound on her phone.  I have tried going through notifications and sounds in setting with no luck.  Does anyone have any suggestions to get the alerts to sound on the phone or through her streamer?
