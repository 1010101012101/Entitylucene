"Download" Finder windows lose focus <body> For as long as I can remember, every time that I've gone to open a downloaded file—either from Safari or Chrome—I'll see the dialog showing the package being unpacked, and then the Finder window with the unpacked contents/installer will flash on the screen briefly and then lose focus behind the browser.  Is there any way that I can keep those Finder windows from losing focus?
