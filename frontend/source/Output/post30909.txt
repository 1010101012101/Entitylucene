Select text-replacement without adding a space? <body> I have set up Lion text replacement to replace a three-letter short-code with my full email address. It works great, and I recommend you all do it. :-)  But - in order to confirm the auto-replacement, I need to press the space key (similar in iOS). Often for web-forms, etc. I don't want that space to be there.  Does anyone know if there is a keystroke which will select the suggested text auto-replacement without adding a space?  <answer32574> I don’t know how to do this with Lion’s text replacements, but you might want to consider TextExpander, which performs a similar task. You don’t need to add a trailing space to open a snippet, which is what you’re looking for, right? e.g. my email address in TextExpander is set off with the shortcut code;g/code, no space required.

I’ve put it again below.
