How to set multiple folder icons in finder (for symbol- and list-view)? <body> I'm using OS X 10.8.2. By default the system folder icons differ in symbol- and list-view in the finder. If I use the list view a small icon (16x16px) is displayed. In symbol view finder switches to a 128x128px icon.  How can I define strongboth/strong of these icons with my custom images?  <answer82944> To change a folder's icon just:  ol liOpen the image you want to use as icon, (with Preview, for instance). Select it all, or the part of it you want to use, and strongCopy/strong it ( kbdCommand/kbd + kbdC/kbd )./li liRight click on the folder and choose strongShow Info/strong ( kbdCommand/kbd + kbdi/kbd )./li liSelect the folder icon image, and strongPaste/strong ( kbdCommdand/kbd + kbdV/kbd)./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAlcA.png" alt="enter image description here"  Doing it this way, no matter in which view you'll be displaying the folder, the icon will be the image you've pasted.
