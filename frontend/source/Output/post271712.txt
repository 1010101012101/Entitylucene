Recovery and Bootcamp Partition not visible on bootup <body> i have a serious problem - i tried to get Linux via refind as triboot to run on my Macbook next to my Bootcamp partition. I was running the MacOS Sierra Public Beta 7.  What i did was, i followed these manual installation guide for strongrefind/strong till step 8 . where it failed because of SIP on the side or before that i partionated my hard drive for my Linux distribution which didnt work either because of the partition error code 8 from the Disk Util. I fixed that by going into single User Mode and using the codefsck -fy/code command. Which fixed the partition problem but now im not able to switch into the Bootcamp or RecoveryHD (to disable SIP) parition anymore. codeCMD + R/code goes into the Internet Recovery and a installation of the normal version of MacOS Sierra 10.12.3 through the App Store didnt work either to make these partitions visible again. Same as making my own RecoveryHD parition which is disk0s4.  precode    diskutil list     /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER     0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0     1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1     2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            285.0 GB   disk0s2     3:                 Apple_Boot                         650.0 MB   disk0s3     4:                  Apple_HFS Ohne Titel              1.2 GB     disk0s4     5:       Microsoft Basic Data LINUX                   23.0 GB    disk0s5     6:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                190.0 GB   disk0s6 /code/pre  PS: If i manually bot into the bootcamp partition via the startvolume in the System Settings it says something like no bootable device found  Thank you in advance for any help!  <comment341529> Please specify what exactly didn't work when you used Internet Recovery. This may be a helpful clue.
