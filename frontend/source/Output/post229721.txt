Wired Apple Keyboard: certain Keys not working after connecting a broken USB mouse <body> Recently I've connected to my Wired Apple Keyboard a wired USB mouse using one of the keyboard's USB connectors on the side. After a while the mouse cable seemed a little flimsy at the base but I've ignored it. So one day while pressing various keys on the keyboard they kept dying one by one until I've unplugged the mouse. It seemed that the bad mouse cable produced a short circuit and killed the keys I've pressed. Now I'm not sure if the keys died "inside" the mother board of the keyboard or locally on the spot under each key. Is there any chance of making the dead keys work again? I'm willing to try the washing the whole keyboard "solution" but I don't see the logic in that since I didn't spilled anything on it. What do you think guys? I would be a real shame of just throwing it away, specially since it's such a nice product.
