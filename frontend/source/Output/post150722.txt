Wifi doesn't work unless I cycle it off then on again coming off of sleep <body> I have a Macbook Pro Retina, 15in, and I have the above issue. In a related question (Wifi doesn&#39;t work unless I turn it off then on again) a user commented:     For as long as I can remember, I've had to do this on my MacBook Pro   Retina 15″ — I've always presumed it's the router, as I only have the   problem at home. I even have a script that will automatically cycle   the Wi-Fi if it's attempting to connect to my home network and fails   for more than 3 seconds :) –  grgarside Jan 26 at 20:00   Does anyone know how to write/load this kind of script? Thanks!  <answer150726> You could try something like this: (Copy and Paste it into AppleScript Editor)  precode-- -- Toggle Airport Power On and Off -- if (offset of "On" in (do shell script "networksetup -getairportpower en1")) &gt; 0 then     do shell script "networksetup -setairportpower en1 off" else     do shell script "networksetup -setairportpower en1 on" end if /code/pre  Change the en1 to en0 (zero) for your WiFi.  If it works save the apple script as application. Pull it to your dock for fast access.  <answer151815> Upgraded to Yosemite 10.10 and problem is now fixed.  <answer248575> Try this Golang script out - https://github.com/icecrasher321/Wifi_Hack  The script automates the process of turning off and on your wifi at intervals of 20 minutes(Future versions will detect packet drops to start the wifi reset process). You can keep it running in the background. More information is available in the README of the github link given above.  If you don't want to install Golang just for this, you can get the same result by using the following shell script  precodewhile :; do     networksetup -setairportpower en1 off     sleep 3     networksetup -setairportpower en1 on     sleep $((20 * 60)) done /code/pre  Run networksetup -listallhardwareports first to check whether your Wi-Fi really is on en1 .  <comment177378> Hey thanks I'm trying to see if I can figure this out based on your answer.. Can you recommend an automated solution? Like "on wake from sleep, toggle wifi off, then on if not connected" ? How can this be done? Want to avoid have to click anything... Thanks! <comment177379> For that you might want to take look at the app called sleepwatcher. http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/10387/sleepwatcher <comment197135> Hi!
