Terminal shortcut keys <body> I've recently immigrated from Ubuntu to Mac OSX Snow Leopard. I use the terminal (iterm2) extensively, and I am a great fan of shortcut keys.  The standard shortcut keys (which work in any GUI textbox) are:  ul likbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd Jumps to first character in line/li likbd⌘/kbd+kbd→/kbd Jumps to last character in line/li likbd⌥/kbd+kbd←/kbd Moves one word forward/li likbd⌥/kbd+kbd→/kbd Moves one word backward/li /ul  How can I impose these shortcuts in iterm (or terminal)?  Are there any standard key bindings for these operations in Mac I should know and use?  <answer38938> The standard shell shortcuts (codeM-/code = meta = option or esc, codeC-/code = control):  ul licodeM-b/code and codeM-f/code correspond to kbd⌥←/kbd and kbd⌥→/kbd/li licodeC-a/code and codeC-e/code correspond to kbd⌘←/kbd and kbd⌘→/kbd/li /ul  kbd⌥←/kbd and kbd⌥→/kbd are bound to codeM-b/code and codeM-f/code by default on Lion's Terminal. On 10.6 you'll have to add them manually:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ji9CO.png" alt="enter image description here"  I haven't found any way to reassign kbd⌘←/kbd and kbd⌘→/kbd in Terminal.  <answer38985> For iTerm2 you can customize hotkeys easily. A similar question was asked here  How can I move through words when typing a command in iTerm2?  <answer38987> You'll also find Ctl-e (end of line), Ctl-a (start of line), and Esc-d (delete word from cursor) work nicely in terminal and other apps, too (along with Ctl-k and Ctl-y mentioned above), as does repeat-letter (Esc-NNN d; Esc-22 d for example to output 22 letter d's). In fact, most of the keyboard shortcuts I've tried from other Unix distributions have worked in OS/X.  <comment44088> +1 Thanks. What does `\033b' stand for? Do you know how can I change this on iterm? <comment44100> iTerm  Prefs  Keys lets you customize your keybindings and shortcuts. <comment44140> A few other useful shortcuts:  `C-w` will kill the previous word.  `C-k` will kill from the current cursor point to the end of the line.  `C-y` will yank back what was previously killed. <comment44141> The '\033' is an escape sequence for the "escape key" on the keyboard, which is essentially the meta key that @Lri mentioned.  So '\033b' is essentially `M-b` and '\033f' is essentially `M-f`.  See, for example, http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100716230217548
