Bluetooth speakers controls don't work with Spotify on macOS <body> I own the UE Boom 2, a bluetooth speaker that has "Tap Controls" that allow pause, play and skip track. These features work fine when I'm using iTunes or soundcloud, but when I use the Spotify app, triggering the actions does nothing. How can I fix this?  <comment336086> Is Spotify in the foreground or background when you have this problem? <comment336094> Have this same issue, pressing the play/pause button on my BT earbuds while playing Spotify opens iTunes.
