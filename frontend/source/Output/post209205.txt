Macbook wifi adaptor turned off after connecting to some wifi network <body> I have Macbook Pro retina (late 2014) with OS X 10.11.  There some wireless networks - emlike my university wifi network/em - that when I select them, and connect, the wifi adaptor would turn off. If I try to turn it off again it won't work.  The only solution I've found is to remove the saved network from codePreferred Networks/code - emunder; System preferences  Wi-Fi  advanced  Wi-Fi tab  Preferred Networks/em - and turn the adaptor on.  strongQuestion is/strong why this happened? and how to connect to these networks?  strongP.S./strong I remember I had this situation at home, when I changed my wifi region setting to my country (emIran/em)
