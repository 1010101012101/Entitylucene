Localhost refuses to connect after upgrading to Sierra OS <body> I have downloaded and installed codeapache/code, codephp/code, codephpmyadmin/code, codemysql/code via macports. Everything was working fine before upgrading to macOS Sierra.   After the upgrade whenever I try to access localhost I get the following error message: "This site can't be reached, localhost refused to connect."   This is happening although my settings in the codeapache/code codehttp.conf/code file remain the same.   I am also providing the content of the hosts file   precode127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost /code/pre  Any advice?  <answer255800> I solved this by commenting out this line from my codehttpd.conf/code:  precodeLoadModule unique_id_module modules/mod_unique_id.so /code/pre  I'm not very familiar with mod_unique_id, but it doesn't seem critical to have on my local development server (your situation might be different).     h2unique_id_module/h2      This module provides a magic token for each request which is guaranteed to be unique across "all" requests under very specific conditions. The unique identifier is even unique across multiple machines in a properly configured cluster of machines. The environment variable UNIQUE_ID is set to the identifier for each request. Unique identifiers are useful for various reasons which are beyond the scope of this document.   <answer255908> I had same issue and i solved commenting mod_proxy_hckeck in httpd.conf  LoadModule proxy_hcheck_module libexec/apache2/mod_proxy_hcheck.so  EDITED: I found in apache.org that this module requires mod_watchdog, but this module is commented, so just comment mod_proxy_hcheck or uncomment mod_watchdog LoadModule watchdog_module libexec/apache2/mod_watchdog.so  hope it works!  <answer257309> I had the same problem. I ran codesudo apachectl configtest/code and got the message:   precodeAH00526: Syntax error on line 6 of /private/etc/apache2/other/default-ssl.conf: Invalid command 'SSLEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration /code/pre  I just renamed the default ssl config file so it's not to be loaded anymore. A apache restart later, everything came back.  <answer273148> After updating to macOS Sierra, Apache httpd moves the old codehttpd.conf/code to codehttpd.conf.pre-update/code and place the new one. In order to work the localhost work please try the below procedure:  precodecd /etc/apache2/   sudo mv httpd.conf httpd.conf-afterupdate   sudo mv httpd.conf.pre-update httpd.conf   sudo apachectl configtest   sudo apachectl restart   /code/pre  Then test:  precodecurl -I -L localhost /code/pre  <comment318256> Have you verified that all of those services are indeed running? <comment318258> if i run the "sudo port load apache2" command i get the following respond from the terminal "/opt/local/etc/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.apache2/org.macports.apache2.plist: service already loaded", so i am pretty sure that apache is running. <comment318267> Please add the content of your /etc/hosts file. Does 127.0.0.1 work? Maybe related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/252466/el-capitan-safari-cant-open-localhost-but-127-0-0-1-works <comment318290> Did you run a configtest to be sure everything is OK? I had a similar issue with the stock install of Apache, something in the update broke one of the dependent packages. <comment318293> Just did the config test and the results were the following:  "httpd: apr_sockaddr_info_get() failed for username-MacBook-Pro.local" "httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message". So i followed this tutorial and "https://mdshaonimran.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/apache2-apr_sockaddr_info_get-failed/" and the error went away, but i still get the refuse message when trying to visit localhost. <comment327211> Commenting out mod_proxy_hcheck solved it for me, too. Before that, Apache would silently fail to bind to its port. <comment344072> That solved my problem. Thank's a lot! <comment363140> Again every mac update issues! now 10.12.5 nothing here worked for me, can't connect to database errors password is correct..pma also not working, apache seems fine..
