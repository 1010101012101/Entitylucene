Mac Sierra can't connect to wifi <body> My Mac, running macOS Sierra (10.12.3) can't always connect to my home Wi-Fi. Other devices and phones work fine, and the MacBook can connect to every other Wi-Fi I try. Also, sometimes it connects automatically to the home Wi-Fi when waking up from sleep, but usually not (giving the invalid password error, while the same connection/password is used when it can connect).  Unfortunately I can't change any setting on the router.  Also, when I delete and reconfigure the connection, it connects and has access to the internet, and then, after like 10s, it disconnects itself.  <comment360178> I don't think it's a duplicate. In my case the Mac can connect to the wifi in rare cases. Also, when I delete and reconfigure the connection, it connects and has access to the internet, and then, after like 10s, it disconnects itself.
