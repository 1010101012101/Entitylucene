Linking manuals from Homebrew <body> Whenever I install a software with Homebrew and I try to view the manual I get an error stating:     No manual entry for code&lt;name of program&gt;/code.   As an example, codewget/code: when I type    precode$ man wget No manual entry for wget /code/pre  So, I'm wondering how to link the man pages so I can view them with the command.  <answer111066> If you installed Homebrew with standard install directories, i.e. relatives to code/opt/homebrew/code, there are 2 commands to register the binaries and man files to be used:  precode/usr/bin/sudo -s echo /opt/homebrew/bin &gt;/etc/paths.d/homebrew echo /opt/homebrew/share/man &gt;/etc/manpaths.d/homebrew exit /code/pre  If you are using codebash/code or codezsh/code as your actual shell, you will have to enter one simple command to take into account these 2 environment modifications:  precode. /etc/profile /code/pre  If you want to learn more how these 2 directories are used under MacOS X, read:  precodeman path_helper /code/pre  <comment130730> Outstanding! That is exactly what I am looking for. Thanks for the prompt response!
