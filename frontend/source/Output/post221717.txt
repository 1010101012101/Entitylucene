(How) Can I push notifications from my Mac notification center to my iPhone? <body> I have a 2015 MBP running OS 10.11, and an iPhone 6s with iOS 9. Can I push notifications from the Notification Center on the MBP to the iPhone? If so, how?  And I mean emany/em notification. I'm not talking about synchronizing individual apps.  <answer221800> You can install codeGrowl/code in your Mac, and install codeProwl/code in your iPhone. Then setup the Prowl to connect to your Growl instance with the API. Finally you need to forward all OS X notifications to the Growl.  <comment343161>  Finally you need to forward all OS X notifications to the Growl.   How can I do this? <comment343192> Actually this is possible for those applications that have Growl stub inside. In my OS X applications this ability remains only for Dropbox, iTerm, VLC and Transmission (4 of 86 apps). You can manage framework stub with Growl Version Detective, downloadable from http://growl.info/downloads . However there are tutorials here: http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/forwarding.aspx https://www.prowlapp.com/faq.php <comment343378> It's obvious. The question is how to do this for all apps and notifications.
