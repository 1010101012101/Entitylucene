How do I change the Icon for a USB device? <body> My phone uses a standard icon when mounted. I just want to replace that icon with a custom one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ymkgw.png" alt="screenshot1"  I'm opening a PNG image in Preview and copying the image, then pasting onto the icon in the Get Info window, but I get the system PNG icon instead of the image itself:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xgXab.png" alt="screenshot2"  How do you use a custom image? OSX gives you no feedback on this at all.  strongUpdate/strong: After some further investigation, it appears that the image is being set correctly in code.VolumeIcons.icns/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hEaL0.jpg" alt="screenshot3"  So for whatever reason, Finder is refusing to display it correctly. Is there some kind of icon format requirement that Finder isn't telling me?  hr  strongUpdate:/strong Now the cut-n-paste method works fine. I have not changed anything, so I have no idea what was wrong before. I can only chalk this up to a Finder bug.  <answer2602> just drag and drop :)  sometimes it does not work so, you do a simple:  ul liCOPY: copy to clipboard the icon you want to use/li liSELECT: select the icon you want to remove/li liPASTE: paste it /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fwj4t.png" alt="alt text"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SAwKn.png" alt="alt text"  <answer117675> Also you can use DiskUtility with Repair disk for USB memory. Icon appears correctly.  <comment2357> This answer is baffling to me. It's as if you didn't read my question at all. I was already using cut-n-paste to replace the icon. Furthermore, the .VolumeIcons.icns file whose screenshot you modified for your answer is only created _after_ changing the icon. <comment2372> cut-n'-paste works every time, so, if it does not work for you, something happen, just restart and try again. I't a Finder feature, not a bug. <comment2409> The fact that this _did not_ work for me was almost certainly a bug, because it works fine now. <comment8908> Please remove images and other stuff from the question to keep it simple. The answer should contain the details, and current answers already contains enough good details. Thanks! <comment9095> @Sorin this is a question regarding glitchy UI behavior; images are perfectly appropriate and helpful in describing the problem. <comment125410> I have had some App Icons not work with cut-n-paste, in the paste, but nowadays they seem to work okay, perhaps apple has ironed some of these bugs out.
