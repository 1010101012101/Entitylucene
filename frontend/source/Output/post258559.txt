Java 6 runtime environment & old Filemaker pro <body> Have an older large environment running FileMaker Pro 10, on OSX 10.7.  It's got:     java version "1.6.0_65"    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609)    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-462, mixed mode)    The problem is that within Filemaker Server, the database Admin Console is a Java applet and ONLY runs in legacy versions, and only runs on OSX Server 10.5-10.7.. Due to a 1000 seat license ($$$$), the client won't upgrade. So we're re-installing on a 10.7 server.  the issue is that when initializing FMP10, you have to have the Console Admin, and it won't fire up withoutthe correct flavor of Java happy...  Apple has offered a version of Java that's supposedly fixing this, (java for OSX 2014-001), but it's not fixing the issue.  The symptom is that whenever I attempt to fire up the applet, i get the following   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2n1vU.jpg" alt="Java RE warning"  Any ideas why it's not seeing the RE that I've got installed?  Or do I have something else set incorrectly?  When I inspect Console, it shows an error flag:      com.apple.JavaWebStart: No Java Runtime present, requesting install.   However, if I hit terminal  (java - version), it shows:      java version "1.6.0_65"    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609)    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-462, mixed mode)   Why isn't it seeing/using the RE that I've got installed?  NOTE: This is a legacy issue, please skip and save yourself a headache if you intend to recommend a newer version of Java or Filemaker Pro.  This isn't happenning..  It worked fine until this server HDD decided to die, and as they have a half-dozen backup units, they're not interested in dropping the financial equivalent of a midsize car into software...  <answer258566> Have you tried with the newest java from Apple: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US ??  And then re-enable the JRE plugin and Java Web Start as described here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202643  <comment323264> The latest Java is incompatible..  Per Filemaker it has to be Java 6 or earlier... can't be 7 or 8..... <comment323265> Apple's Java is only v6 - Oracle is v7 and newer <comment323273> yes, have 're-enabled' the JRE and the Java Web Start as shown.. It's still NOT firing up the applet..       I need Java 6 or lower... Filemaker pro won't use 7....
