My iMac hangs when I try to boot from a USB | EFI Boot <body> I have an iMac (iMac 8,1) and I am trying to install Windows on it. I used bootcamp to create all required parts and got to the part where it rebooted. I got the "No bootable USB devices" so I shut it off and started it holding option and the selected the USB drive that I created with BootCamp called "EFI Boot", thing is, is the mac just freezes and I have to shut it off, no matter the media I put windows on it always hangs at this part. Any suggestions?   <comment236967> Can you test that USB on another Mac ? <comment237249> I believe you must use a DVD. The USB will not work on that model. Also, you should select a Window boot, not an EFI boot. In other words, you should install using BIOS/MBR. Do not us EFI/GPT. On the other hand, you can install either 32 bit or 64 bit version of Windows. The 64 bit will require more memory. <comment237458> Yes, I actually figured the DVD part out, I got Windows installed and its working great! Thanks!
