Can Google Chrome auto updating extensions be stopped? <body> A few days ago a hacked version of a Google Chrome extension I use was distributed via Chrome's automatic extension updates.   Is it possible to stop Google Chrome from automatically updating extensions?  I've seen instructions on how to do block Google Chrome itself from updating, and how to block individual extensions from updating, but those were for Windows, not Mac OS X.  I'm currently running Chrome 60.0.3112.50 beta, under OS 10.12.5.  Thanks for any assistance.  <comment365291> [How to disable Google Chrome extension autoupdate](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27657617/how-to-disable-google-chrome-extension-autoupdate) <comment365355> Thanks. I already saw that link. Those solutions either don't work, aren't applicable, or are not what I'm looking for.
