Can I use automator to select text then search spotlight for it? <body> Basically, I have a spreadsheet of file names.  I want to select a file name and search 4 folders simultaneously for it. I'd prefer for all the results to be listed in 1 Finder or 1 Spotlight window, but that's not necessary. I feel like it should be something I can do with an Automator service that receives selected text but I haven't been able to figure it out.  <answer204914> I think the closest you are going to get is something like this.  ( In a Automator strongService/strong  Document )  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UpWLD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I am just show two folders here as an example.  The first action gathers the selected text into a variable.  Each Spotlight Action ignore the above actions output/input and uses the variable token as the search term.
