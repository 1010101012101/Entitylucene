2015 13" MacBook Pro Trackpad and Keyboard stop working <body> Recently the keyboard and trackpad on my 2015 13" MacBook Pro have stopped working. This is the second laptop to do this, the same issue happened about 6 months ago and Apple gave me a new one when they could not figure it out.  The issue usually starts with force touch not working then progresses to the keyboard and trackpad not being recognized at all. Currently the power button works and force touch works but all other keys and the trackpad don't work.  When this happens there are a lot of errors in the console regarding the AppleHSSPIController.  precode4/21/16 6:56:47.000 AM  kernel[0]   Error: AppleHSSPIDevice::start failed to get device descriptor 4/21/16 6:56:47.000 AM  kernel[0]   Error: AppleHSSPIController::_enumerateDevice Start failed 4/21/16 6:56:47.000 AM  kernel[0]   Error: AppleHSSPIController::_handleEnumerationFailureGated Giving up on device /code/pre  You can see the full log here: http://pastebin.com/r8x9S46K  <answer246397> Since I ran into the same problem and this comes up on Google, I will provide an answer, even if there is no question.  ul liWhen my keyboard and touchpad stopped working, the power button was still ok./li liResetting NVRAM did not help./li liUsing an external keyboard and mouse was fine./li /ul  Typing codesudo dmesg | tail/code on the command line was showing similar messages:  precodeAppleHSSPIController::_enqueueSPICommandGated SPICommand timed out.

They first tried it by updating the touchpad controller software. Since that did not work either, they changed the strongHSSPI cable/strong.  <answer246403> Most likely, your internal keyboard and trackpad has failed.  The "Internal Keyboard/Trackpad" is a USB device, so there is no special controller or circuitry involved on your logic board.  If you plug in an external USB keyboard/mouse and everything works, then it's definitely not your logic board as the symptoms would be present then as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hab0V.png" alt="enter image description here"  As for the cause, it could simply be a manufacturing defect of the keyboard, trackpad, or some other related component.  Without actually having the component to bench test, it would be impossible to guess what exactly is wrong with it.  However, the trackpad and keyboard are technically separate components even though they are part of a master assembly called the "top case."  If you have ability and resources, you can open your MacBook Pro and disconnect either the keyboard or the trackpad.  If the symptoms go away, you will know that is the component has failed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qe37E.png" alt="enter image description here"  If not, do the opposite and see if the results differ.  You will need an external mouse and keyboard to do this test.  <answer265296> I'd same issue since last week: macbook pro, 13'' early-2015, retina. Internal keyboard and trackpad stopped responding at all but external usb or bluetooth connected keyboard/trackpad worked well. code/var/log/system.log/code was showing recurring messages like below every time I restarted machine.  precodeDec  3 00:48:22 foomac kernel[0]: AppleHSSPIController::_enqueueSPICommandGated SPICommand timed out.

Apple USB device only shows up external and not the internal keyboard/trackpad, when connected.   I sent macbook for repair to AppleCare under warranty, and got it returned with change in Trackpad cable (part number - 631-01309). Cost $ 0! Make sure to back up the entire system using Time Machine as very likely repair person will wipe out your system and resets to factory default. S/he kept the same OS version though for my macbook (10.11.6).  Following restore from time machine, my macbook seems to be running ok and culprit codeHSSPIController/code error is gone now. Following are codesystem.log/code messages with reboot of system.  precodeDec 17 08:40:45 localhost kernel[0]: AppleHSSPIController::start Start Succeeded Dec 17 19:10:54 localhost kernel[0]: AppleHSSPIController::start Start Succeeded /code/pre  <answer285849> I ran into the same problem with my Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015 MBA, in order to save people some time I'll post my solution here.  First I reset smc, pram, vram, updated the OS, reinstalled it, installed it on an external hard drive but nothing worked. So I thought it is a hardware problem.  As last attempt I started the computer in the safe mode holding down shift while starting up. Nothing was changed but after restarting in the normal mode suddenly both keyboard and trackpad were working again.  I hope this helps you too.  <comment288283> Welcome to Ask Different!  I can't see where you're asking a question.  Can you indicate, as specifically as possible, what type of assistance you're looking for?  Here's some info that will help you create good questions: https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask  - From Review - <comment303103> Great question with great degree of detail. Can you eventually post how you got it fixed? Did you have the keyboard and touchpad exchanged at the apple store? <comment303843> Is this a "great question" as you commented to the OP or is there "no question" as you prefaced in your answer?  These two statements seem to contradict each other. <comment303986> @Allan, possibly I might just claim in retrospective, there was irony involved in my original comment. :P
