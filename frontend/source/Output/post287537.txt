Missing purchased tab in App Store and Family Sharing in iOS 11 <body> How can I get access to family purchased apps in iOS 11? The new version of the App Store has no purchased tab where I can select the family member in top left corner and get access to download app without payment from my Apple ID. iBooks and iTunes Store have this tab.  <answer287539> In the Today tab, tap the account icon in the top right, then choose Purchased.  <answer287898> You can search the app you want to download and choose to purchase. After you give your password the new appstore gives the message that someone else in your family already paid for it and you can download it for free.  This is confirmed by myself just now after i read about it on the developers forum at apple beta.  <comment363056> But there no option to select family member tab <comment363485> Don’t forget to file bug report with Apple  and check on beta site for known issues @user3812375. I can’t imagine that iOS 11 is even feature complete yet let alone not swimming in bugs. <comment370315> I have the family memembers, but most of them show no purchases, better submit a bug report
