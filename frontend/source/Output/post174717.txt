How to paste Chinese/Unicode characters to Terminal? <body> I'm trying to paste these Chinese letters: 你好世界 to my Terminal, but instead I've got "^L" or some other weird characters.  The same happens for other unicode characters (such as £āēīōūśṣṭēīōū) when pasting or pressing kbdOption/kbd+kbde/kbd, then kbda/kbd for á, kbde/kbd for é, kbdi/kbd for í and similar, then I've got C!C)C- instead.  In Terminal Settings, I've got Character encoding set to Unicode (UTF-8) (codePreferences/Settings/Profiles/Advanced/code) and in Encodings tab I've UTF-8 enabled.  I've codeLANG=C/code, however setting it to codeLANG=en_GB.UTF-8/code doesn't help.  However it works when I run echo:  precode$ echo -e "\xE2\x98\xA0" /code/pre  My Terminal settings are:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/77fqol.png" alt="Terminal Settings on OSX"  I'm using Terminal v2.4 on OS X Mavericks (10.9.5). My shell is bash.  How I can configure Terminal to support Unicode characters?  <comment205777> works fine at default settings for me. I'm no terminal guru so I've never changed any settings in there. I can't find that Emulation pane though, where is it? EDIT...What OS are you on, I found the prefs but no Emulation header. <comment205778> I'm on OS X Mavericks (10.9.5). Terminal v2.4. <comment205779> I'm on Yosemite - essentially, the same prefs settings [other than Bell, which is unlikely to be the kicker] I also have VT100 checked; I'm guessing that ain't it either. <comment205780> @Tetsujin Emulation pane is in Preferences-Settings. choose your Profiles and Advanced tag. <comment205781> Yup - I found it, it just doesn't say Emulation, it says Input on Yosemite - threw me for a minute
