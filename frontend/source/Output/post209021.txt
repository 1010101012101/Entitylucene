How to update internal PHP <body> How do I update the internal PHP on OS X 10.7.1? I've loaded a current version but since I don't have a simple plan how to update it, I won't do it. I guess it's just easy replacing of files in codeetc/apache2//code.  Would anyone please write me a quick manual?  <answer209022> A quick method is to use Marc Liyanage's PHP installer.   Open Terminal.app and run  codecurl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 5.6/code
