Where did tab completion go? <body> Recently, in both Terminal and iTerm, my tab autocompletion has stopped working. About 80% of the time I just get the error sound when I hit TAB. About 20% of the time I get the expected behavior.  Don't even know where to start to fix it...Any thoughts?  <comment103163> Are you using the Bash shell? Tab completion is very limited by default in Mac OS X, so what is the current behavior and what do you want to accomplish? <comment103233> are you having trouble tab-completing commands, paths or both? <comment103265> both paths and commands sem to be spotty. I mostly use it for paths. Before I only had to type the beginning of a path name (eg, cd proTAB to get to cd programs), now it usually just beeps at me <comment107943> Anything strange in your $PATH?
