Windows 10 Update Anniversary <body> I have installed Windows 10 on my Mac with BootCamp. This week, Anniversary Update has been released. I wanted to install it. I have launch wizard to upgrade Windows.  Windows restarts.  Now, even if I press 'Alt' key, the boot menu does not show. Mac OS X starts, slowly... very slowly... very very slowly... When login screen shows up, I can not use keyboard or trackpad.  To start my computer, I need to plug external keyboard and external mouse... Mac OS X is very slow (when I mouse the mouse, I need to wait few minutes before see the cursor movement)  Mac OS X started and logged in, I can use Mac correctly.   I can access to BOOTCAMP partition in Finder.

I did on a HP machine. The process is similar to a complete operating system upgrade. My fear is that you did not entirely complete this grade. I also wonder if any partitioning changes were made. What is the model and year of your Mac? Does Windows appear as a Startup Disk in the System Preferences? You can also post the output from the following commands.  (Although at this early stage I am not sure doing so will help) `diskutil list`, `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`. These commands will not change your computer.
