iPhone: Is it possible to rename the extension of a file? <body> I have an iPhone 5. I am new to this world.    Example file:  precodeMyFile.zip.jpg /code/pre  ... must be strongrenamed/strong to:  precodeMyFile.zip /code/pre  ... or, if not possible or feasible, this file :  precodeMyFile.jpg /code/pre  ... must be strongrenamed/strong to:  precodeMyFile.zip /code/pre  strongSumarizing/strong: I would like to acquire some strongcontrol of the extension/strong (the characters after the last dot code./code) in the name of the files.  Methods strongeasy/strong to perform for unexperienced users are preferred.  What could this be used for?br Example: strongPrivacy/strong is something of the past, we must admit it. But some people (like me) still would like to be able to send, say, a private email that only the receiver will read.    strongSending encrypted files/strong is becoming forbidden for some email providers, like GMail (read their terms), so code.zip/code or code.rar/code encrypted are returned to the sender as failed. And installing strongcryptographic programs/strong is a nightmare for common (and even experienced) users of something like an iPhone.br A simple workaround: send your files (a document if you just want to send text) stronginside an encrypted file/strong (say .rar) like:  precodeMyPrivateFile.rar /code/pre  ... but rename it to:  precodeMyPrivateFile.jpg /code/pre  The receiver must rename just the extension, and voila! : you both have succeeded in sending encrypted info via email.br But, as you know, the email program's stronginterface/strong in the iPhone is too simple. I am not very experienced in using it, but I think it does not allow... well, it does not allow many things, even file saving inside the phone, so renaming file extensions must be even more difficult.    <answer196403> Tho I have never had to do this before but I just checked and it seems that Dropbox allows you to rename files. So if you have a file attachment in email you can save an "image" file in an email to Dropbox and once there you can rename it.  A bit of a kludge but Dropbox accounts are free...  <comment234576> Clever, clever...it works just fin in OS X. Have no idea about iOS. The problem (or not) is that mail can not read the file with "wrong" extension, so I have to save it and change the extension. <comment256945> Awkward, but at least it is a solution. Thanks you, Steve. I hope someone will offer another more practical way of solving this.
