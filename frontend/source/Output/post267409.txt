To deal with superfluous carriage returns in TextEdit <body> I want to let TextEdit never save code&lt;CR&gt;/code, the carriage return.   Different operating systems save end-of-line as different Unicode characters.  For MS DOS (like Windows) it is code&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;/code, and for Unix and Mac code&lt;LF&gt;/code, and for the very old Mac OS 9 just code&lt;CR&gt;/code.  Here code&lt;CR&gt;/code is the carriage return, and code&lt;LF&gt;/code the line feed.   When sometimes I paste, into TextEdit, several paragraphs from a Windows-created file, for example codepdf/code or codedoc/code/codedocx/code, code&lt;CR&gt;/code's are also copied.  TextEdit does not fully conform with Unix standards, in that it does accept code&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;/code's, by showing them indeed as line breaks.  I cannot tell, then, whether a line break is Window-styled code&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;/code or Unix-styled code&lt;LF&gt;/code.   When I save my personal writings in pure text (codetxt/code) written in Markdown, I don't want these code&lt;CR&gt;/code's, but can neither see them, nor delete them in TextEdit.  It is when I open the text file in question with Vim, did I spot those code&lt;CR&gt;/code's shown as code^M/code.  Indeed, in Vim, it is easy to replace them with empty strings.   However, I too edit in TextEdit often.  Can I set TextEdit so that it never saves code&lt;CR&gt;/code's in a buffer of its?  That is, when I paste a code&lt;CR&gt;/code in a buffer, the code&lt;CR&gt;/code is ignored and not written.   <answer267421> I don't believe that TextEdit has such an option.  It happily accepts all line ending types (even intermixed within the same file) and displays them properly.  You would probably need to use a text editor where you have direct control over the line endings and text encoding type when saving the file.  BBEdit is a great text editor that has such controls.  Another option is to convert the file with a utility like dos2unix.  The website doesn't offer a macOS binary download so you would need to either compile it yourself or install a package manager like Homebrew first then install the dos2unix package with codebrew install dos2unix/code. For an easy solution you can just run codeperl -pi -e 's/\r\n/\n/;' FILE.TXT/code as well.  <answer267422> When I understand you right, the problem lies in the OSX Clipboard. It's the place to fix the behaviour, if there is one. See e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3482289/easiest-way-to-strip-newline-character-from-input-string-in-pasteboard on how to deal with newlines in the OSX Clipboard.  <comment335762> I would suggest a better solutino than `dos2unix` since it would fix occurences everywhere: `perl -pi -e 's/\r//g ;' file.txt`. <comment340024> Sorry I forgot this question completely. Actually, I don't mind open Vim and batch-replace by `:bufdo %s/\r/\r/g`. Your suggestions are all reasonable.
