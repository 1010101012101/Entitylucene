Can't Spotlight search mounted server volume: Unable to perform operation. (-403) Server search enabled <body> I am trying to get Spotlight to search files on a AFP-mounted NAS on my home network.  Per the advice in this question, I run the following command to activate indexing:  precodemdutil /Volumes/name -i on /code/pre  But this yields the error:     Error: unable to perform operation.  (-403)       Server search enabled.   br When running the command to show the current status, it appears as if search is already enabled.  precodemdutil /Volumes/name /code/pre     Server search enabled.   br What can be  done to resolve this situation? I have seen that there are some other questions about the code(-403) Server search enabled/code error, but I'm not sure how they would apply to my situation.  Searching the NAS in Finder works as intended, however.
