Static IP for a adhoc wifi network <body> Do you know if it's possible to give a static IP when creating a ad-hoc network on OS X?   <answer53121> Of course, to actually do much in ad-hoc mode you even have to setup static IP addresses.  Just start the ad-hoc network, then in System Preferences - Network "Click the lock to make changes" and then click "Advanced". And there you have it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FkTFv.png" alt="System Preferences, Manual TCP/IP settings"
