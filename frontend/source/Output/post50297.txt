Lion Mail shows emails sent years ago as sent on 30 March 2012 <body> Mail on 10.7.3 has decided (for some reason) to show several mails of mine sent years ago (like 2010) as having been sent on 30 March 2012.  In the mails themselves, the correct date is shown (under sender, i.e. me, and subject line).  What did Mail do to sort those mails under 30 March 2012 (that might have been the day I upgraded to Lion)?  <comment57638> Are you looking at Date *Sent* or Date *Received*? <comment57639> I would assume that those mails arrived the same day as they were sent, or at least the next day. However, as I said, this is about mails of mine sent and the sender is "i.e. me". <comment57640> My apologies for misreading the question. I thought you were asking about mail you'd received. <comment57641> No apologies necessary. I assume if it had happened to mails sent to me it would be the same problem! <comment57656> A picture might go a long way to illustrate what date is off and which is correct...
