Podcasts App Crashing On Startup <body> I have been using the podcasts app for a while now amd recently(Around a month ago) It started to crash on startup.  Things i've tried: Deleted all downloaded episodes. Turned every "automatically" things in settings. Cleared Cache. Restarted IPhone.  Phone Specs: iOS 9.3.3 Iphone 6s  Thanks in advance for the help :)  <answer265200> Sure you have solved your problem since August but maybe the solution is going to Settings - Podcasts and turn off Podcasts Sync. Then open the app, check all is ok, and go to Settings to turn on again Podcasts Sync.  <comment308198> Which iOS version? <comment308201> iOS 9.3.3 | IPhone 6s <comment333617> Didn't work, i'll update the thread in a minute.
