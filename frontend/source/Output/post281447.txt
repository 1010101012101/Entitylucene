What am I missing?  precodeon adding folder items to theAttachedFolder after receiving theNewItems -- Get the name of the attached folder  -- Get List of files in folder       set the_files to get every file of theAttachedFolder  -- open vlc using files in folder which should result in a vlc playlist  of all files in folder      tell application "Finder" to open {the_files} using application      file "VLC.app"   end adding folder items to /code/pre  Any help will be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty new to this. Thank you.  <answer294304> You should be able to simply:  precodetell application "VLC" to play {the_files} /code/pre  I can't test this right now, so let me know if you end up using different syntax.  <answer294376> precodeon adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items     tell application "VLC"         set thePlaylist to "file:///Users/Smokestack/Desktop/For Vlc" -- substitute with your own actual folder path to the folder action folder following the format “file:///“         OpenURL thePlaylist     end tell end adding folder items to /code/pre
