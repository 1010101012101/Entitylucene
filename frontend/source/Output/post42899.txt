Disadvantages of 32 bit mode <body> I have a Cisco VPN client in OSX 10.6.8, which runs only in 32 bit mode.  Are there any serious disadvantages of switching to 32 bit mode permanently?  <answer42901> Not inherently.  32 bit mode should run fine as long as all your drivers and binaries include a 32-bit version, which is currently the case unless you specifically downloaded 64-bit versions.  It should even use a little less ram.    But:  ul liMountain Lion will be 64-bit only, so I don't expect universal binaries to include 32-bit versions forever./li liI have "slimmed" all my binaries to delete the 32-bit version.  If you have ever used such space-saving utilities, the slimmed apps won't work./li /ul  <comment48792> Are there any limitations as to Physical memory? <comment48793> No, it will support whatever your hardware does.  ([More on the difference](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=783948)) <comment48798> Is the is the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client ? I'm running OS X 10.6.8 in full 64 bit mode with version 2.5.2006 of this client without any problems.
