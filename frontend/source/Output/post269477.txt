Mac book pro display size adjustment <body> I dropped my macbook pro and as a result 1/5 of my display is covered with blue and green lines making it impossible to see anything underneath. However, the rest of the screen is still usable and the glass did not crack (i think i broke the led underneath the glass). Anyway, im wondering if there is a way to adjust the display area so the it only uses the right side of the screen so i can continue to use it without losing stuff behind the lines?? I know you can adjust the display area on windows, but i cant figure out how to do it on mac. Any help is appreciated.
