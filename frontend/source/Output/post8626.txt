Can all music and playlists/ratings be transferred back from an iPod Touch to a PC? <body> How can I get my songs from my iPod Touch to my PC?  Some of the songs were purchased through iTunes, and others were ripped from CDs.  This is what happened:  ol liThe iPod Touch was set up to sync with my PC via iTunes, so my PC had all of the music on it./li liThe PC got infected with viruses and the computer needed to be formatted./li liThe music is now only on the iPod Touch and not on the PC./li /ol  Is there any way I can get my songs back to the PC from my iPod Touch (or iPad or iPhone since they all run iOS)?  <answer8627> h2Software to Recover Music from an iPod on Windows/h2  ul liSharePod/li liMusicRescue/li /ul  <answer14454> Try SharePod:     strongChange/strong br/   Add and remove music, videos, playlists and artwork on your   iPod.      strongBackup/strong br/   Backup all those tracks you just can't lose onto your computer.

On mac, the software I'd most highly recommend is PhoneView.  PhoneView is the well supported, a good value for my needs, as well as very full featured.  <answer37560> Just click "Transfer Purchases". Then, all your Apps, Music and Video Purchased from iTunes will sync.  NOTE: Music, Video not purchased from iTunes will not be transfered. But you can try strongiPod to computer/strong transfer program.  With this software, you can back up and restore all of your iPhone content to computer, including your favorite songs, books, videos, photos, play lists and more.  Hope it helps.  <comment9336> Hey Senseful, Let me know how this worked out <comment15583> Oh wow, that is great! <comment15614> Just for completion: they're both not free ;) <comment17113> @Rabskatran Whoops, I thought I had accepted it. <comment42623> possible duplicate, perhaps merge? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14451/how-can-i-transfer-non-paid-music-from-my-ipod-back-to-my-pc <comment85464> Note that this will bring back the music that Apple sold - but without playlists, ratings, etc... <comment85466> I wish iTunes Match could be started from a device in this case - perhaps for an additional fee since Apple would need to "loan" you server space to process all the files and iTunes in the cloud downloads / write new software to merge things without iTunes on your Mac/PC.
