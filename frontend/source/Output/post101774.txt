How to quit Trim Enabler? <body> I just updated Trim Enabler after updating my Mac to OS X 10.8.5. The new version doesn't have a quit button, option or anything like that. How do I close it? I cannot remove it from the menu bar by dragging it. What can I do, short of rebooting?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EMUUE.png" alt="Trim Enabler in system tray"  <answer101777> You can use AppleScript to send the application a quit Apple event:  precodeosascript -e 'quit app "Trim Enabler"' /code/pre  Quit Apple events are also used by loginwindow to quit non-Cocoa applications when you log out.  If that doesn't work, codekillall Trim\ Enabler/code is probably also safe. It sends the process a TERM signal, which usually allows a process to terminate cleanly.  <answer101797> You can strongpress kbdâŒ˜ cmd/kbd + kbdQ/kbd when the app (actually, the menu) is opened/strong, according to an official answer from this blog post.  <comment119902> You mean you want to close that window! <comment120002> Interestingly, this actually works!
