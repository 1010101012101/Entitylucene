On January, Apple, sent and email to the Developers stating that:     Starting February 1, strongnew apps and app updates submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 5 and iOS 7 SDK/strong.   This can be found, too, in the iOS7 developer's page, were it's added:     Use Xcode 5 with iOS 7 SDK to compile, strongvalidate/strong, and strongsubmit/strong release versions of your iOS 7 apps to iTunes Connect.   <comment139792> Why wouldn't you like to use the most recent version? I don't think Apple will keep supporting older versions as they keep changing many stuff each version.
