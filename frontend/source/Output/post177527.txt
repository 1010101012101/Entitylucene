Specification for CUPS printing options <body> I would like to ask if someone knows where can I find all the possible printing options the can CUPS send to backend/filter etc.   These are some of the possible options:  precodecom.apple.print.PrintSettings.PMBorder..b. com.apple.print.PrintSettings.PMBorderType..n.=1 com.apple.print.PrintSettings.PMColorMatchingMode..n.=0 com.apple.print.PrintSettings.PMColorSpaceModel..n.=0 com.apple.print.PrintSettings.PMCopies..n.=1 com.apple.print.PrintSettings.PMCopyCollate..b. /code/pre  I would like to get the full list of these options, but can't find any specification for that.  https://www.cups.org/documentation.php/doc-2.0/api-cups.html#cupsParseOptions  <answer188289> h2Documentation/h2  The standard documentation of codecupsd/code configuration file is available with:  precodeman cupsd.conf /code/pre  h2Modification/h2  These options are configured through the codecupsd/code configuration file which is:  precode/etc/cups/cupsd /code/pre  If codecupsd/code is running it will overwrite it. Hence so as to be able to edit it, here is how to proceed:  ol listop codecupsd/code:  precodecd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons /usr/bin/sudo launchctl unload org.cups.cupsd.plist /code/pre/li liedit codecupsd/code configuration file:  precodecd /etc/cups cp cupsd.conf cupsd.conf.orig vi cupsd.conf /code/pre/li listart codecupsd/code:  precodecd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons /usr/bin/sudo launchctl load org.cups.cupsd.plist /code/pre/li /ol
