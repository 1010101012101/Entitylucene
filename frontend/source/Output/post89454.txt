Mountain Lion Mail using over 40GB of memory <body> Mail in Mountain Lion (10.8.3) seems to be having one heck of a memory leak.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6nUSj.png" alt="enter image description here" As you can see, it's using over 44GB of memory and 200% CPU.  Machine specs:  ul liMac Pro/li li2 x 2.4 GHz 6-Core Xeon/li li64GB RAM/li liSSD drive/li /ul  <comment104983> I assume you've already quit/killed Mail and restarted? <comment104984> Yeah. Not a HUGE hit on performance, but the system as a whole is a little laggy (especially Mail.app itself). <comment104985> @patrix Yeah, done that a few times. It's been doing this for a few days now. <comment104986> "Usually" issues like that are related to a specific mail. Got any with an embedded video or so? <comment104988> @patrix I have a few in my inbox that have attachments (.doc, .pdf, .png). But that's it. Maybe I should just suck it up and process the stuff in my inbox and see if that fixes it. :) <comment104990> 6 Core Xeon, 64 GB RAM, SSD drive, and what fails is Mail? @_@. <comment104992> How many accounts do you have? Maybe it's related to one specific account. <comment104993> @ShaneHsu I have 5 accounts. <comment104994> @Shpigford That could be a problem. Did any of those accounts have an incredibly large amount of emails? <comment104995> Well all of them have many years worth of email...but the only "view" I'm ever in is "Inbox" which typically only has a couple dozen emails across all my accounts. <comment104998> @Shpigford Also sample it. I think if you can pin down the reason for that high CPU usage, it should be the same for the incredibly high RAM usage. Also, is virtual memory enabled?
