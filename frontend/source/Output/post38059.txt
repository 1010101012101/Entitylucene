WPA2 Enterprise TTLS PAP connection for iPad <body> I can't connect to my university's enterprise wireless using my iPad. It uses WPA2 Enterprise with TTLS and PAP. When I enter my username and password it asks me to accept a certificate which is not verified, when I click accept it tells me that the username or password is incorrect (though they are correct). What should I do to fix this?  <answer40057> @Vlad is correct. Alternatively, it may require you to use this format for the username:   domain\username  <answer40890> Okay so I figured it out myself. Apple provides a configuration utility for configuring WiFi and some other settings.  For Windows - http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1466  For Mac - http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1465  I created a configuration profile using it and entered the WiFi settings there -   Security Type - WPA/WPA2 Enterprise  emProtocols/em  EAP Types - TTLS  Inner Identity - PAP  emAuthentication/em  Username - yourusername  Password - yourpassword  I then emailed this configuration profile to myself and opened it from my iPad and it worked.  <comment43168> With WPA2 Enterprise we had problems if we didn't use full usernames: *username@domain.tld* instead of just *username*
