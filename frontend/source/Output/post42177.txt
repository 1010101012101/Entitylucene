What does "@" signify in unix file permissions? <body> I have a file with the following permissions on my MacBook Pro:  code-rwxr-xr-x@  1 root  wheel   101K Feb 29 17:09 apachectl/code  What does the code@/code stand for?  I can't execute the file and this is the only thing that's standing out to me.  How can I get rid of it?    Just as some background, I copied this from a Time Machine backup.    <answer42178> Thanks to @Jeff for the correction.  I was miss-remebering.  ul liThe code@/code is displayed with a extended attribute is set/li liThe code+/code is displayed for an ACL./li liIF you have both an attribute and a ACL then you see code@/code./li /ul  Run the command codels -le filename/code to see if it has any ACLs set.  Since your problem seems to be with accessing the file, I bet you have a ACL set in addition to an extended attribute.  To get rid of an ACL run codeecho | sudo chmod -E filename/code for a file or codeecho | sudo chmod -R -E directory name/code for a directory.  See the chmod man page.  <answer42179> If the file or directory has extended attributes, you'll see an @ in the permissions field. For extended security information (ACLs), you'll see a +.  From codeman ls/code on OS X:  precode-@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output. /code/pre  The codexattr/code program can be used to display and manipulate extended attributes. Take a look at what's there before deciding to go while deleting those attributes, though. Definitely take a quick look at the man page for xattr too.  A quick example from some example PHP compromise code I keep around for reference:  precode$ ls -@l php-compromise.php  -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  group  502620 Jul  5  2011 php-compromise.php     com.apple.FinderInfo        32      com.apple.TextEncoding      15  /code/pre  <answer43231> I found that the code-E/code or code-N/code are actually invisible even when using codesudo/code. The only way I could fix it was by logging in as strongroot/strong  <answer243708> With the apple quarantine attribute, chmod is not enough to remove it.  You need to remove the attribute explicitly:  codesudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine my_file/code  <comment47930> thanks for the response.  how can I get rid of it? <comment47931> Updated with an answer that I believe should work. <comment47932> @Zoredache ACL permissions come with a plus sign. The @ is "extended attributes." <comment47933> Yeah, I am seeing that as I double check.  I must have remember backwards.  And what happens when a file has both? <comment47934> Nevermind, I got a mac booted up.  If you have an `@` extended attribute and `+` acl set, it appears that ls will show a `@`.  Since he is having problems accessing a file, it seems likely to me that the problem more likely that he has a problem with an ACL. <comment47935> The attributes don't control access permissions, but can be interpreted by applications. The ACLs are, well, ACLs. Now, since he's talking about time machine, time machine files are often marked as immutable. They're really kind of a pain to cope with. Good to know about the "+@" combo showing as "@" <comment47936> I though immutable just blocks changes.  I didn't think it prevented a file from being executed?
