How do you set up iPhone Mobile Calls? <body> I have iPhone 6 (iOS 8.1), and I am trying to use a 2013 MacBook Air (OSX10.10) to call using the iPhone.  I am getting this error message  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZ6gI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now obviously I have checked that both devices are using the same iCloud account - of course they already were.  Has anyone else suffered a similar issue and can it be fixed?  <answer152322> I actually managed to find a fix for the issue I was having.  Under Facetime settings on my iPhone, Facetime was turned on, but it wasn't activated.  I had to turn off Facetime, switch it back on again and then activate it from another device.  It now works.
