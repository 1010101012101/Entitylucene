looking for an iphone app to grab a camera frame over http <body> I have an unused iPhone 4 that I'd like to set up for long-term timelapse photography (multiple months). It seems like this is best to do by using the iphone as a remotely operated camera, and have a separate system grabbing camera frames remotely when appropriate. This way I don't have to worry about filling up local storage, and can work with the frames as they come in rather than getting everything at the end.  Ideally, what would work for this is a simple webcam app that can take a camera shot and serve it over http, so I can just do something like "wget http://192.168.X.XXX/frame.png" periodically.  The closest I've found is Phoboslab Instant Webcam, that does streaming video over http, but full streaming is overkill for this use (and may cost quality), and it looks like it won't be simple to grab a frame from that remotely. Does anyone know of a better app out there for this use?
