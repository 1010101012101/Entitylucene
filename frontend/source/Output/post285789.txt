Mac Mini shutdown restart and sleep issues <body> I have a mac mini (mid 2011) with some strange sleep behaviour:  Basically whenever (~90% of the time) it tries to go to sleep, it reboots. It also does the same if you hit shutdown. I assume hitting reboot causes this strange reboot behaviour, but hard to tell!  Then when it's booting, it sometimes (~50% of the time) ends up in a boot loop - with the progress bar getting to about 30% before it reboots.  If I get it to boot in verbose mode, after a couple of cycles, it boots.  It will strongalways/strong boot in safe mode.  The only thing I've found is the shutdown reason of -128 (unknown/other).  I think it's RAM based, is there anyway to be more sure other than buying new RAM?  It's strongdefinitely/strong not OS or disc based since I've installed fresh OS's of different versions (Yosemite, Mavericks, macOS) and on it's two different internal drives.  <comment360520> Did you run the hardware test? <comment360521> I did a while back and it turned up nothing.. running it again now <comment360552> Shutdown Cause  -128 is hardware related.  See this [answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/244285/119271) for more details.  What you can do is remove **one** RAM module and test.  If it continues, swap modules.  If it still continues, change slots and repeat.  If it continues after you have swapped both modules and slots, it's probably your logic board. <comment361566> I've tried to run the hardware test a few times (both extended and normal) with memory in either / both slots - the test doesn't complete in any combination.. basic one gets 26-27 seconds in then freezes (for 24 hours or more). logic board gone? Can try the oven trick perhaps? nothing else for it!
