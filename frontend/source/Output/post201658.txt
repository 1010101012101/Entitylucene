Mount external HDD readOnly option <body> I have the following problem: I used the optical bay to use a HDD in my mid 2010 13" Macbook Pro in addition to my SSD. It was working just fine until a few days ago, when it started to get "slower". VLC Player (on SSD) wasn't able to play videos on the HDD anymore, and when I tried to copy files from the HDD to the SSD it took ages (the speed was about 20 mb/m). Also it took a really long time to see what's in a folder when I opened it (but after 5-10 seconds I could at least see what files were in which folder).  My first question is: Is my HDD slowly dying? What could the problem be?  A friend was trying to help me repair it (he tried several things in the terminal and in safe mode - I do not remember all of it, but anyhow.. nothing worked). During this we unmounted the HDD and since then I am not able to mount it anymore. When I try  precodediskutil mount /dev/disk1s2  /code/pre  in the terminal it says  precodeVolume on disk1s2 failed to mount If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option /code/pre  How can I try to mount it in readOnly mode?  precodediskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk1s2 /code/pre  doesn't work..  I would really appreciate it if you could help me. I have a lot of new photos and music on the HDD I have not backed up yet.  <answer213964> Enter in Terminal.app:  precodesudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk1s2 --settype "Apple_HFS" /code/pre  and then try:   precodediskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk1s2 /code/pre  <comment243127> Additional info: I removed the HDD from the Macbook and put it into an external case. And the HDD seems to be ok from the outside. At least it doesn't make any unusual sounds like other dying HDDs. <comment320701> did you find a solution? <comment320702> hey look at this:   $ sudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk4s1 --settype "Apple_HFS" Trace/BPT trap: 5     $ diskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk4s1     Volume on disk4s1 failed to mount If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option <comment337877> this still didn't work for me: I got the same error
