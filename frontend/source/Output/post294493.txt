USB Keyboard is not using the desired Input Source <body> I have two keyboards connected to my MacBookPro. I'm using a different Input Source for the Mac keyboard. Unfortunately the external keyboard is not using the same Input Source -- it's always using the "default" input source and I can't find anyway to change it.  I've even setup the shortcut to change layouts from the keyboard, and typing it on the external keyboard does not change it's layout -- it only changes the layout of the mac keyboard.  The only place I actually see my external keyboard in the settings is under codeModifier Keys.../code, but I can only change modifier keys there.  How do I get the external keyboard to use my desired Input Source?  --  The external keyboard is a basic Logic keyboard (Germany layout). It's a USB keyboard connected via a KVM switch.  By "Input Source" i'm referring to the tab in the "System Preferences" "Keyboard" settings called "Input Sources". What I guess one would normally refer to as keyboard layouts. I have two layouts here, named "ABC - Extended" and "MyKeyboard". I used ukele to create "MyKeyboard" a slight modification of "ABC -Extended" (this one cannot be removed for unknown reasons).  <comment371729> Can you please let us know what kind of external keyboard you use and how you connected it to your Mac? (USB, Bluetooth) <comment371974> What are the NAMES of the two input sources you are talking about? <comment373130> So I guess you are saying that your external keyboard refuses to use your custom input source but only will use ABC Extended?  Will it use some other Apple-supplied input source like French or German when they are also active.
