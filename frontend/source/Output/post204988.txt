Is it possible to choose language for spell check for each individual mail? <body> I commonly write mails in different languages and would like to have the spell checker function with that. Previously I have been using Thunderbird on both my macs and linux machines, but recently I have decided to give up on Thunderbird and try Mail.app instead (since Thunderbird isn't actively developed and apparently lagging behind).   In thunderbird you can have a combobox that allows you to choose a dictionary with which the software checks spelling. Is something like that possible for OS X Mail.app? I know the "Automatic detect" function but it doesn't seem to work particularly well beyond English (at least in my case).   Are there any plugins or anything like that?  <comment247182> You can choose the dictionary via Edit  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar. <comment247183> When using "automatic", did you first go the Setup item at the bottom of the list and check the boxes for the languages you normally use? <comment247184> @TomGewecke yes, I kept only the languages I use everything else is unchecked
