See iAd Revenue in the new iTunes Connect layout? <body> I'd like to know how I can see my iAd revenue in the "new" iTC layout? Two days ago there was a link in iTC (I think the label even said iAd revenue or stats), but now all I have is the new iAd Workbench. Do you know where the new page for iAd revenue is?  <answer93798> Looks like apple hides the url. After log in iTunes connect, visit https://iad.apple.com/itcportal/ directly.  Update: visit https://iad.apple.com/  <comment135706> While this is beyond weird, the URL worked... thank you! <comment143828> Are we supposed to guess that by ourself ? Thanks @Vince ! <comment155000> It is unfathomable!!!
