How can I get the exact URLs/requests that a program is trying to connect to? <body> I currently use Little Snitch to control network traffic on my Macbook Pro, and see what my apps are connecting to.  Unfortunately, Little Snitch only shows you the hostname that an app is connecting to. Is there a tool which will show you the full URL of the requests that apps are making? Even better if you can view the headers.  <answer40474> h2HandsOff!/h2  is very similar to Little Snitch. I've explained differences in an answer here.  The network monitor shows hostnames, but it will distinguish them if they have emdifferent IPs/em.  Via right-click you can get the specific IP address - you don't get to see the full URL request. But the IP address is more specific anyway.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iHBEm.png" alt="enter image description here"  The developers are open to feature requests. You might see such a feature added in the future.  <answer40495> Sounds like you need a packet sniffer.  Wireshark will log and do full disassembly on all traffic going through your network interface.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k0hbo.png" alt="enter image description here"  In other words, it will not just show you the full URLs of each request, but it will let you look inside all the packets, so you can see the headers and content too (except in SSL connections, as they are encrypted).  It works on just about every platform out there, including Macs.  <answer40498> The most full featured way to peek into web traffic is to install and configure your system to use a web proxy.  The mitmproxy proxy (and codemitmdump/code tool) is mature, reliable and well documented so I would start there unless you have another that meets your specific needs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5vTM.png" alt="Image from mitmproxy.org/images/mitmproxy.png"  <answer40505> Whilst it won't give you the full URL, if you're a fan of the command line, then iftop also comes in quite handy and shows you both incoming and outgoing hosts, port numbers (names for well known ports) and cumulative totals for each - as well as live updating "graphs" on the command line :-)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/28onI.png" alt="enter image description here"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Yr5u.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment45765> In the picture you see several entries for `api.tweetdeck.com` (in total it's about a dozen). Each IP has it's own entry. <comment45809> How do you see the URLs? There's so much traffic that I can't see the URLs. <comment45810> @daviesgeek - Add a filter for `GET` requests. That will let you just see the requests for HTTP requests. Alternatively, you can filter for whatever type of traffic you are looking for, if you're not just looking for HTTP. It should also be able to filter for DNS requests. <comment45812> Also, you're going to want to turn off anything else running in the background, if you can. Since wireshark shows you everything, reducing the volume of traffic you're not interested in helps tremendously.
