Time Machine error code 21 and 19, "Failed to mount.... because the image could not be attached" <body> With macOS sierra (10.12.4), Time Machine backups to a Synology NAS are failing in the "preparing backup" phase. The UI messages aren't helpful, but console shows this error from backupd:  precodeFailed to mount '/Volumes/TimeMachine/fubar.sparsebundle' because the image could not be attached, error: Error Domain=com.apple.backupd.ErrorDomain Code=21 "(null)" UserInfo={MessageParameters=(     "/Volumes/TimeMachine/fubar.sparsebundle",     19 )} /code/pre  This repeats every 60 seconds for several minutes, and then Time Machine gives up.  I'm familiar with the sort of problem fixed by https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/39842/30668 but this seems to be different. I can mount the network volume and attach the sparsebundle. Running fsck shows no errors. The sparsebundle plist shows codeVerificationState/code 0, and doesn't have a codeRecoveryBackupDeclinedDate/code.  <answer280959> This turned out to be a keychain problem. Possibly I changed the NAS login password and never updated keychain.  ol liSettings  Time Machine  Stop using "TimeMachine" for Backup/li liKeychain  search for NAS hostname and delete all matching passwords. I think the problem entries were in the System keychain, but I also deleted entries from the login keychain./li liSettings  Time Machine  Add Backup Disk...  select "TimeMachine"  enter password/li /ol  This situation was confusing because the messages from Time Machine didn't say anything about authentication, and Finder could connect to the NAS volume ok. But apparently backupd uses a different Keychain entry, which was bad or wrong.  <answer285341> My problem turned out to be that the Time Machine user account accessing the NAS had exceeded its quota from usage elsewhere in the volume (facepalm).  This ended up causing the codeInfo.plist/code file inside the sparsebundle to be 0 bytes. Fortunately there was an codeInfo.bckup/code file in there that I copied over to be the new codeInfo.plist/code.
