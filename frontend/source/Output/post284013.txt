No memory available on my iPhone 6? <body> I don't understand why I can't save or take photo or video in my iPhone 6. I have 32GB and my photo gallery is empty. I did not install anything for example games and other app. When I record a video, appears a notice "full memory". I have just restart my iPhone 6 but it remains like before.  <answer284014> Go to Settings - General - Storage &amp; iCloud Usage - Manage Storage.   It will show you strongUsed/strong and strongAvailable/strong Space on your iPhone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VfHFh.png" width="375"  <answer284025> If your recorded video size is more than free space available on your iphone then it give you full memory or insufficient memory. Try to record 1 or 2 min small video and then see what happen. I am sure it allow to store on your iphone. Check your dcim folder for that connect your iphone to computer and see what is the size of that folder. Also check free space of your iphone under setting - manage storage. you can also store on icloud but for that first connect to wifi.  <comment358152> Will you go check your storage settings as to what takes space on the iPhone?
