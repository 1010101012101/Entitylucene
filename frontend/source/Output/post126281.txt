How to recover factory reset in iPhone 5 apps without backup <body> I forget my passcode and when I reset my phone I lost all my data, photos and apps. I was connecting to iTunes but I never backed up.  How can I get all my photos and apps on my iPhone 5 without a back up?   I was able to restore my apps from iTunes, but its like new again, how can I include the data inside the applications?  <answer126290> Since you have NO back up there is no place where your data could come from (they are lost).  Sorry, but next time do a back up before doing stuff like Factory reset.  <answer250230> But if you have a apple ID you can get apps back by simply downloading them on device with no extra fee  <comment147887> The whole point of a backup is that it allows you to get back everything, if you haven't done this then I don't know how you intend on getting your data.
