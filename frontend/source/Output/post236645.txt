iPhone 4 Mail Usage Size Problem <body> My email on iPhone 4 consumed 8 GB from usage.  I deleted all mail and the account and there's still 8 GB consumed.  I use STMP mail.  What else do I need to do?.  <answer236650> Did you restart the phone after you deleted the emails? If that doesn't work, try removing that particular email account, rebooting the phone and then re-adding it via strongSettings App  Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendar/strong  <comment289632> Did you empty your trash?
