How to install a Canon MX860 on MacBook Pro running MacOS 10.12.4? <body> I updated the OS on my late 2013 13" Retina MacBook Pro to MacOS 10.12.4 and found that scanner of my Canon MX860 Multifunction printer did not work any more.  I downloaded and ran the the latest IJ Network Tool, I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I have read through Apple support pages etc and tried various suggestions but have failed to make it work.  I would appreciate any help. Thank you.  <comment352283> What software have you tried using the scanner with? Have you tried using other software as well?
