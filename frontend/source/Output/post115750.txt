iOS Says "Connection failed and unsupported" when connecting to Mac through Bluetooth <body> I'm trying to connect my iPhone 5s to my Early 2011 Mac Book Pro through bluetooth. When I try to connect after pairing, it gives me the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XMkNW.png" alt="Screenshot of the settings app"  After searching around on the web, I found people saying that this has never been supported, but that's obviously not true! I've done it before, and popular apps like Knock To Unlock strongemrequire/em/strong connecting to Mac via bluetooth.  My iPhone is on iOS 7.0.4 and my Mac Book Pro is on 10.9.1.  Can emsomeone/em strongplease/strong tell me how to connect?
