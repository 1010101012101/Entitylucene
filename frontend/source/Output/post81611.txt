How can I map the F4 key's default functionality to trigger a key sequence rather than open Launchpad? (Mountain Lion) <body> I will use the touchpad gesture to open Launchpad. I don't use Launchpad much.  I'd like to map the F4-key (which opens Launchpad) to send the Keystroke kbdCommand/kbd + kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd4/kbd so I can use the OSX screenshot feature with it.   BetterTouchTool does not allow me to do it because it does not recognize when I press this key. I can get BTT to recognize F4 (i.e. hold kbdfn/kbd then press F4) but this is not ideal: I need the top row to mostly function the way they already do while also not requiring pressing kbdfn/kbd to take a screenshot.  <answer81612> This is more or less exactly what I wanted.   http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/  Works perfectly and no BTT is needed for setting the keyboard shortcut (Do it through Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts in System Prefs)  <answer81655> Using KeyRemap4MacBook, you could also add this to private.xml:  code&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD, ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::KEY_4, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;/code  See the source for the key code constants and predefined settings.
