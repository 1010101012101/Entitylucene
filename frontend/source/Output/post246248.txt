Used 'Erase Phone' through 'Find My iPhone' and lost my photos, can I retrieve them? <body> I've used Erase phone on 'Find My iPhone' through iCloud's web. Is there a way except iTunes/iCloud backup to retrieve the lost files? (Images)  I thought about the program (Can I write program's name here?) (To Retrieve directly from phone).  I'm really feeling lost, those photos that were there are very important for me.  Thank you!  P.S. It's iPhone 5  <comment303575> Possible duplicate of [How to recover photos from a stolen iPhone?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191629/how-to-recover-photos-from-a-stolen-iphone) <comment303626> @Allan I didn't get the answer I needed there for my current question.
