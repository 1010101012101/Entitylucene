Vuze cannot transfer any data <body> I'm having a bit of trouble with Vuze after installing 10.7 (and the JRE.) Vuze can connect to seeds and peers, but no data will transfer! That makes it a bit useless.  So far I have tried:  ul liRunning Vuze as root/li liSwitching to the 32 bit JRE/li liTrying the 4.2.0.5 Vuze beta/li liAttempting to run it using the Java 1.7 OpenJRE (wouldn't launch.)/li /ul  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!  <answer17398> Don't know about Lion, but in Snow Leopard, and with some versions of Vuze, you have to use a non-default Java to get it to work right. Here is some info.  I have to re-do this on every update of Snow Leopard, so perhaps the same will be needed with Lion.  <comment18934> Lion is not officially available yet, so you'll have to wait to get an answer here. So can [see](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lion) that a lot of Lion-related question were closed. <comment18936> @Loic What's the reasoning behind that? <comment18938> This [answer](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/399/how-to-handle-lion-questions/400#400) (and the comments) sums it up. Kyle's comment specifically: "because it may be subject to change prior to release, making the answers potentially incorrect" <comment19020> thanks, I'll try that out later and report back if it worked. <comment19055> @Coxy: Because discussion of pre-released Apple software is forbidden outside of their forums according to the NDA you signed in the wrapper agreement upon installation. <comment19086> I'm afraid that after following all the steps, the Java5 JRE did not show up as an option under Java Preferences. :( <comment19087> I don't see how that's a decision that you can make for me. <comment19432> @Coxy: Per your flag, we will not be reopening previously-closed Lion questions.
