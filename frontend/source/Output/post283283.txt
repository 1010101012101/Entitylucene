How to parse output from diskutil activity in bash script <body> I want to be able to run a bash script over each line output from codediskutil/code activity", I haven't been able to figure out how to do this though.  I thought maybe I could simply:  codediskutil activity | xargs bash myScript.sh/code  I have a feeling that codexargs/code is just going to wait until codediskutil/code activity is finished talking, which it will never do until you end the process.  Any suggestions on how I can execute a script per line of output would be appreciated!  Cheers!  <answer283284> The delay is probably due to buffering.  Try codexargs -L 1 bash myScript.sh/code if you can process the data line by line.  <comment357128> @lhf Thank you this works great!
