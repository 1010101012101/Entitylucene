Here is an example of your code, re-written for Chrome:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     execute front window's active tab javascript  "document.getElementsByName('0.7.7.7.7.7.5')[0].value=" &amp; quoted form of theProfil &amp; ""     delay 0.1     execute front window's active tab javascript "document.getElementsByName('0.7.7.7.7.1.7')[0].click();" end tell /code/pre  See this question on Stack Overflow for reference, or consult the Google Chrome AppleScript dictionary (in Script Editor, click codeFile/code  codeOpen Dictionary…/code and choose Google Chrome).  <comment335702> Is there a question here? <comment343679> that's perfect, I was looking for this for ages, thank you
