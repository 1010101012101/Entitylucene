External drive does not mount after plug off without eject <body> I accidentally unplugged my hard drive without properly ejecting it, and now the drive does not mount when plugged in.  What can I do to make it work again?  I can see the disk in codelsusb/code and codediskutil list/code.  So far, I've tried:  ul licodesudo diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/disk2/code/li licodesudo diskutil unmount force /dev/disk2/code/li liReboot with disk./li liReboot without disk./li /ul  It seems that the disk is working because it's vibrating very slowly, but I can't see it in Finder.  <answer235310> If you can see it in codediskutil list/code, locate its identifier (comes in the form of code/dev/diskx/code) and run:  precodediskutil mountDisk /dev/diskx /code/pre  while replacing code/dev/diskx/code with your disk identifier.  If even that does not work,  precodediskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/diskx /code/pre  will mount your disk as read-only so that you can get your data off in the case that you have corrupted your disk's partition table (emvery, very unlikely caused by hard-unplugging your disk/em). If so, you will need to format your hard drive, through the steps found here, along with the man page obtainable through codeman diskutil/code if you need more information.  <answer235322> did you try, first of all, to repair the volume looking for errors with disk utility (or terminal)?  <answer235337> That has happened to me many times. Go to Launch Pad, Disk Utility, and select the disk that won't mount. Then select Repair.  <answer264551> I run into this problem today and I finally solve it by strongeject the disk first/strong. after that you can strongsuccessfully mount the disk with no error/strong.  precodediskutil eject /dev/diskx diskutil mount /dev/diskx /code/pre  <answer272017> SOLVED. Had this problem today. OLD external drive, had its own power source, plugged into a surge protector. I hit the power button on the surge protector when I was unplugging something else, and the drive was turned off while in use. I turned it back on and it sounded normal, but my computer wasn't recognizing it, and Disk Utility wouldn't load when it was plugged in. I tried restarting with and without the disk,  mounting, unmounting, all of the above recommendations.  "unmount" led to "the disk is already unmounted or has a partitioning scheme...."  "mount" and "eject" said the attempt timed out.  "mountDisk" said it was successfully mounted, but I still couldn't access it, and "unmountDisk" would be successful as well, but no luck to "mount" or "mountDisk" afterwards.  I finally found the order that worked.   precodediskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2 diskutil eject /dev/disk2 /code/pre  then I just plugged it back in to my computer and we were golden. Thanks for all your help everyone.   <answer283025> I had the same problem. Failed mount, eject and repair. Windows saved my life. I plugged the external hard disk to a Windows laptop. Copy a file from the external hard disk to the desktop and cut the file in the desktop and paste(replace) back to same location in the external hard disk. Ejected the external hard disk properly from the Windows PC and plugged it to my Macbook. Problem solved.    <comment287787> `One or more volume(s) failed to mount` for both commands. Thanks anyway <comment287793> @charles try mounting the problematic partition alone, with `diskutil mount /dev/diskxsy` <comment287794> @charles do also try the `readOnly` option <comment287797> `Volume on disk2s2 timed out waiting to mount` with and without `readOnly`. <comment287800> Disk utility is not fully starting.

Is there a chance that diskutil repairDisk works? <comment287827> I don't think that OS X can handle such partition as it would do with hfs partitions however you can try gdisk utility from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gptfdisk/ but I am not familiar with that, I just know it has "generic" repair (non destructively) features even for windows gpt partitions <comment331689> downvote with no reason annoying me, why don't you point up what is wrong with my answer <comment338982> both commands timeout or fail <comment341899> @7heaven your tip got me on my way - thanks! <comment362831> All answer are not working for me except this with `readOnly` option. After mount in `readOnly` mode, I have ejected with `finder` and physically remove-plugin usb cable again: it works!
