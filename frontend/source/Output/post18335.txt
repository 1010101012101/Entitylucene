Can I gift a song from the iPhone iTunes app? <body> Just as the title says: can I gift a song from within the iTunes iPhone app? I searched but couldn't find any option to.  <answer18336> Gifting only works from iTunes on a computer.   Perhaps it could be added if enough people ask to spend money that way.   http://www.apple.com/feedback/  You can also gift from store apps with iOS 6.  <comment127546> Its possible in iOS 7.. look at the screenshot here..https://www.dropbox.com/s/8979y51lfs4tun2/Photo%20Nov%2008%2C%201%2057%2019%20PM.png <comment129831> @akash that unfortunately applies only to whole albums <comment129833> I only now saw the edit to this question, which unfortunately makes it less correct. <comment129839> correct. for individual songs, you have to gift it through desktop app..
