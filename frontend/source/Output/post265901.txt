Formatting SD card as FAT32 on Mac? <body> Named brand micro SD with 8 gigs on it. Trying everything to format as FAT32, on a Mac running Sierra and I get this error:  precode/dev/disk2s1 does not appear to be a whole disk /code/pre  When running this:  precode$ diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2s1 1 MBRFormat "MS-DOS FAT32" UDOO 1024M /code/pre  Any idea what's going on here?  <answer265911> codepartitionDisk/code wants the entire drive as its target, because it's about to erase all partitions &amp; replace with your new parameters.  code/dev/disk2s1/code is your existing 1st partition on that drive, codedisk2/code is what it's looking for. I'm not actually certain why codedev/disk2/code wouldn't work, but it doesn't.br That would make your commandbr code$ diskutil partitionDisk disk2 1 MBRFormat "MS-DOS FAT32" UDOO 1024M/code    You can also simplify the command if you like, as far asbr code$ diskutil partitionDisk disk2 1 MBR fat32 UDOO 1024M/codebr &amp; it will still work.  As pointed out in comments, the volume name only needs to be in quotes if there's a space. I'd missed that, my bad.  Ref: http://ss64.com/osx/diskutil.html  <comment333436> You need to post the commands you are trying to run. Also post output of `diskutil list /dev/disk2` <comment333437> $ diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2s1 1 MBRFormat "MS-DOS FAT32" UDOO 1024M ...is the command I was trying to run. <comment333474> Are you using disk utility?
