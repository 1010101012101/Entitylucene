Aliased fonts in Picasa for OS X <body> I just installed Picasa on Mountain Lion, but the fonts are really ugly and aliased:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LEICn.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is a MacBook Pro with Retina display, if that makes a difference. Is there something I can do about this?  <answer86720> This is a common problem with many apps on the retina Macbook Pro. We'll just have to wait until Google updates Picasa for the high-resolution display. There is a discussion about this on Google's Product Forums.  <comment100247> That's unfortunate, but thanks for the info!
