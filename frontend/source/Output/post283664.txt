How to have two sound input and output in Skype <body> I use MBP 2015 with macOS 10.12.4.  My wife and I usually have Skype conference together. We want to use a bluetooth headset and a wired headphone with mic. I tried to use 'aggregate device' in 'Audio MIDI Setup' to form a device with and set Skype to use it. But only the mic of the bluetooth headset picks up sound though the headset and headphone can hear properly.  Can anyone give me some hints?
