Macbook Pro hard drive failing? <body> I'm trying to figure out if my Mac's hard drive could be failing, or that it could be some other component or the HD cable.  After transporting my Mac about a week ago it started beachballing a lot. I mean a LOT, like every time I try to change the window or do anything, it will beachball from anywhere between 10 seconds and a few minutes. I was using Caffeine before to stop the laptop from falling asleep and I am afraid that maybe I left Caffeine on during the transport, which could have damaged the drive, but I am not sure.  The most notable thing is that any operation that involves the disk itself seems to be very very slow.  I tried DiskWarrior for example and it took a day and a half to rebuild my directories from status 8 to status 10, which didn't help the performance of the computer.  I also tried DriveGenius to scan for physical errors. It took about 12 hours to get to 26% (and this was not the "extented test") and found two "dubious areas", after which I cancelled it cause it would probably take another two days to finish.  EtreCheck indicated some HD errors in its SmartREPORT.  Downloads and copy operations (such as the back-ups that I did) will sometimes be fast and then become very slow and/or freeze for a couple of minutes. Sometimes they will then continue, sometimes not.  Booting is no problem even though slightly on the slow side, except in safe mode which I left for 45 minutes and the percentage bar went all the way until the end but it never booted up.  The HD doesn't make any weird noises. I haven't had any messages about possibly corrupted data.  I'm basically trying to figure out if I should go through the trouble of buying a new HD cable, or if I should just replace the HD immediately, or perhaps try to low-level format the disk and reinstall everything to see if that might get rid of possible bad blocks.

A drive doesn't need to "make noise" as a symptom of failure - noise is usually an indication of a bad motor, bearing, or servo (mechanical parts) that are worn.  Failing read/write heads or defects in the surface of the platter would make no noise at all.    strongemEverything else listed that indicated slowness or non-booting are all symptoms of drive failure./em/strong  One quick way to check the SMART status of your drive, is to issue the following command in Terminal:  precodediskutil info diskX | grep -i smart /code/pre  Where "X" is the device number of your drive.  You can find out what the number is, if you don't know it, by issuing the command codediskutil list/code and locating your particular drive.  But, for a MacBook, it's more than likely codedisk0/code since you only have one drive.  strongIs your cable bad?/strong  Possibly, but not very likely.  Cables don't go bad unless you do something to them.  Unless you opened up your MBP and did something that required manipulating the drive cable, you can assume all is well.  strongShould you low level format?/strong  No.  You have a physically failing disk; low level formatting can't fix it.  A lot of people like to "stress" the drive as an attempt to repair it; this makes zero sense.   If you have a failing transmission in your car, would you drive it harder or tow a heavy load as an attempt to fix?    h3Your fix:  Replace the Hard Drive/h3  There's no way around it, you are going to have to replace the drive.  There's also no convenient time for a drive to fail but it only gets worse the longer you wait, so replacing it sooner is always better than later.  strongThe Good News/strong  Now's an opportunity to install an SSD.  Your particular MBP will support standard 2.5" SSDs which are not at all expensive.  A 1TB SSD at the time of this writing is now under $220 and a  120GB is under $40!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X3i8P.png" alt="enter image description here"  You mentioned that you "updated" (I'm taking that to mean you "backed up") your important files; this is good.  However, your drive wasn't big enough to do a full clone.    strongGet a USB to SATA Adapter to facilitate migration/strong  If you do this sooner rather than later, you can use your old drive as an external drive and use Migration Assistant to move everything over.  All you will need is a USB 3.0 to SATA adapter that will turn any SATA drive into an external drive.  They're cheap and indespensible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R88N4m.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongReplacing your drive/strong  Replacing it is super easy.  You basically remove the 10 Philips screws on the back cover to remove it and the two screws holding the drive bracket:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJ2z7m.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6yzRqm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  When you remove the cable, just be extremely careful - meaning don't pull too hard.  Ifixit.com has an excellent step by step guide to walk you through this procedure.  Just reverse the steps to install your new drive.  h3Get an external drive for Time Machine/h3  Last but not least, get an external drive to have Time Machine backups of your computer.  Yes, it's another $60 or $70, but the question is, emhow much would you be willing to spend when your drive fails and you don't have a backup?/em  That $60, in retrospect, would be super cheap.  h3Make sure you have everything you need before you begin/h3  When you undertake this, make sure you have installation media, meaning a USB installer of El Capitan or Sierra.  This means you would have to download it and create your USB installer strongembefore/em/strong you do start this.  Make sure you have:  ul liThe replacement parts (new SSD and USB to SATA Cable)/li liThe right tools #00 Philips screw driver/li li4GB USB flash for the USB installer/li liA fresh backup of your important files/li liSerial numbers (where applicable) of applications you wish to reinstall/li liThe new USB drive to set up and do your first Time Machine backup/li /ul  Once you do this repair and upgrade to an SSD, not only will you see increased reliability, but much, much higher performance than you previously experienced on your MBP.  <comment325557> The errors seemed to be quite old though (like after 1 year of use) and I found it hard to read the report and understand it properly. Also the SMART status of the disk is OK according to DiskWarrior and Disk Util but I understood fmor the internet that that doesn't mean a lot <comment325559> That's true, but it's a good indicator - sort of like the check engine light.  Remember, you have a 4 year old drive and that's about the life span of them <comment325565> Thanks for the extensive comment! REally appreciated! :) I've been looking at SSD drives on Amazon but I do wonder if the price difference makes it worth buying one. 120GB is really not enough I suppose...I have 500GB now and it's already quite small to be honest. <comment325604> I personally have the 1TB version and even though it was 3x the price of a spinning drive, it's been well worth it.  You could even get a smaller SSD and replace the SuperDrive with a [2nd Drive Kit](https://goo.gl/uMwSBg) and make your own [Fusion Drive](http://www.macworld.com/article/2014011/storage-drives/how-to-make-your-own-fusion-drive.html) if price is a concern.  You will get the speed of an SSD, but the economy of a traditional hard disk
