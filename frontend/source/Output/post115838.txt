Can I run an SQLite operation from Terminal? <body> When I download transactions in Quicken Essentials for Mac, my bank adds "DEBIT PURCHASE" and other junk to the Payee info.  Quicken has no ability to find and replace globally.  But I dug into the Quicken data file and it turns out all the transactions are stored in a SQLite file.  I was able to open this file with Liya and then run a query, e.g.,  codeUPDATE ZFIPAYEE SET ZNAME = replace(ZNAME,'DEBIT PURCHASE - ','');/code  which cleaned up my transactions.  Is there some way I can run this kind of query directly from Terminal without having to open up Liya and then opening the file?  <answer115840> Yes. You can use the code/usr/bin/sqlite3/code command line tool to modify the database. It ships, default, with OS X so you don't need to do anything other than open a Terminal window and then run:  precodecd path/to/quicken/storage/directory sqlite3 &lt;quicken database file&gt;  SQLite version 3.7.13 2012-07-17 17:46:21 Enter ".help" for instructions Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";" sqlite&gt; UPDATE ZFIPAYEE SET ZNAME = replace(ZNAME,'DEBIT PURCHASE - ',''); sqlite&gt; .quit /code/pre  You can do it all from one command line like this if you like:  precodesqlite3 &lt;quicken database file&gt; 'UPDATE ZFIPAYEE SET ZNAME = replace(ZNAME,\'DEBIT PURCHASE - \',\'\');' /code/pre  That will open, modify and close your database file and return the prompt.

I also want to delete all the `CHECKCARD 1215` references, where the `1215` is a date that changes all the time. Does `replace` have a wildcard function? <comment135551> ...or maybe I could just 'trim' off the first 14 characters where `like "CHECKCARD ____%"` ? <comment135552> SQLite supports just about the whole gamut of SQL queries, so yes you can use wildcards with `replace`. You're venturing in to a topic that's slightly out of bounds for Ask Different though because it's not Apple-specific. It's actually a programming question. <comment135553> Which StackExchange site do you suggest? I Googled wildcards for `replace` and came up with nothing easy. <comment135554> http://stackoverflow.com/ -- don't quote me a wildcards and `replace` though. I am far from an SQL expert.
