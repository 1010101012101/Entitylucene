How to remove space character (whitespace) from end of filenames and foldernames? <body> Problem with mac is that it allows space character at end of file or folder. If this file or folder with space character in end is beeing copied to FTP using Filezilla or Dropbox then mac makes folders with "Foldername_WhiteSpaceConflict" To get rid of this problem all files and folders with space character needs to be renamed without space character. What solution could be the best using terminal or some program?  <answer174118> Here's the script to find and remove trailing space from files and dirs:  precode#!/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                                                                          IFS=$'\n' for file in $(find -d . -name "* ") do   target_name=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/[ \t]*$//')   if [ "$file" != "$target_name" ]; then       if [ -e "$target_name" ]; then           echo "WARNING: $target_name already exists, file not renamed"       else           echo "Move $file to $target_name"           mv "$file" "$target_name"       fi   fi done /code/pre  <answer174119> Something like this should work:  precoderuby -e "Dir.glob('* ').each { |name| File.rename name, name.chomp(' ') }" /code/pre  This will remove trailing spaces from every file/dir in the pwd.  <answer242778> I had to fix the script a bit more. For files or folders ending in the letter 't', it would also delete that letter. And the call to check if the file exists wasn't working properly so changed "target_name" to $target_name and it works now.  precode#!/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                                                                          IFS=$'\n' for file in $(find -d . -name "* ") do   target_name=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//')   if [ "$file" != "$target_name" ]; then       if [ -e $target_name ]; then           echo "WARNING: $target_name already exists, file not renamed"       else           echo "Move $file to $target_name"           mv "$file" "$target_name"       fi   fi done /code/pre  <answer286940> There is an application for Mac called 'Name Mangler' , this will do everything you could every want to do to a file/folder name, and you can even create your own code and use it in the app. There is a free trial which gives you 4 unlimited attempts, and you can revert the names back if you make a mistake.   <comment205048> What happens if you have a file ending in space inn a dir ending in space - won't the file have a wrong name after the dir has been renamed <comment205049> Good one, updated my answer :) <comment205050> Position of `-d` is important here, also I've added a check to prevent `mv` from overwriting existing files. <comment205052> @patrix thank You for improving my answer. <comment205066> Automator might be useful, if you're not a programmer.
