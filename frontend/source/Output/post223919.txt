iOS switch network configuration <body> On our iPhones (a lot of test devices) we switch often between a plain network connection and a connection with a proxy. The normal flow require  ol liGo to codesetting/code/li liSelect codewifi preference/code/li licodeenable proxy/code/li litype the proxy address/li /ol  Is there any way to "save" the proxy setting and enable/disable with a single button?  <answer223926> You should look into configuration profiles.  Their contents are described here:  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html  You can build two profiles, one with and the other without proxy, and you would be able to create a link to each. Add those two links to a single webpage, and then add that page to Home Screen.  That's two taps rather than one, though.  Another option is two make two separate pages, each with a javascript redirect to download the profile. You could then save each of the pages to the home screen.
