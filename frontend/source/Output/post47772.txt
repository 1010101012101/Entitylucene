Xcode Keyboard Shortcuts Conflicted <body> Xcode has a preferences window that allows you to set keyboard shortcuts but many of my shortcuts are conflicted. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AfSII.png" alt="Xcode shortcuts"   I've looked through all of system preferences for anything using these key combinations and came up with nothing and I closed down all third party apps like Alfred and still no luck.  Any ideas?  <answer47773> ul liThe control + function keys are found in Keyboard Shortcuts, in the section on moving keyboard selection around. Things like strongMove focus to Dock/strong. (I forget what it's called, maybe Keyboard &amp; Text?)/li liCommand-option 8 is Accessibility, for strongTurn zoom on and off/strong. I'm not sure where command-option-\ is found./li liThe control-# keys are probably Spaces/Mission Control shortcuts. I think they're control + number by default. How to configure these has shifted around a little./li /ul  <answer47782> I had this problem too, and nothing in Keyboard Shortcuts in System Preferences was showing "^-6" as bound to anything.  But I figured it out...  ul liActivate Mission Control/li liAdd a bunch of spaces (I added 5, so I had 6 total [not counting Dashboard])/li liGo back to Keyboard Shortcuts. You should now see the "Switch to Desktop emn/em" options there under the Mission Control heading/li liUncheck them/li liReactivate Mission Control and remove the added spaces/li /ul  <comment54738> I hit this batch of conflicts recently. I don't remember where I found them, but it did turn out that Xcode was correct. Hopefully, someone remembers where. :) <comment54751> Thanks David, I also figured it out the same way about 15 minutes after I asked. Can you go tell whoever worked on the Snow Leopard import, that they almost had me pulling my hair out :)?
