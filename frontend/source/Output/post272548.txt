How to use a .dmg file <body> I'm trying to use a .dmg file. I have it downloaded and everything but whenever I try to open it, it doesn't do anything. Am I doing something wrong?  <answer272565> Double-clicking a .dmg "mounts" it (which kind of is tech slang for "make its content available), and usually it should then show up in the side bar of a Finder window. If it doesn't, type kbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd and enter code/Volumes/code followed by kbdReturn/kbd to see a list of all mounted volumes. One of them should be your .dmg file.  <comment343525> The image file is a box. What happens when you open it depends on who filled the box. If you have an empty box, maybe nothing happening is correct.
