File Name Bubble Hovering on Screen? <body> I'm not sure what just happened... I was just about to rename a file, and just mis-clicked off. - After that point there was a constantly floating yellow bubble with the file name in it, on the finder window. I couldn't click it or drag it, however if I showed desktop it would float off screen along with the finder window.  I force closed Finder, and it was gone when I re-opened. Just very intrigued as to what this was? As it didn't seem like a bug (As it tended to float and act in unison with the finder window).  Any ideas?  iMac OS X 10.8.2  <answer80676> Well I've managed to replicate it myself, seems like a bug.  If you start to edit a filename, right click, click "look up "File name here"", then quickly click off, the yellow look up box will stay floating on the screen.
