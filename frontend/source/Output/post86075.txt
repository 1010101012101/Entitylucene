Do open source licenses restrict Apple's ability to provide a native package manager? <body> I realize that there are many useful package managers for OSX (homebrew, macports, fink), but I don't understand why they are not part of the official operating system.   It seems that the App store is the closest thing to a native package manager, and it is not clear why Apps can't be installed or updated from the command line, or why it doesn't contain software commonly used by developers. It would be useful to have such software installed with useful defaults (e.g. accessible in the default PATH). For example, codeapt-get/code configures MySQL and puts it in the system path, but brew does not so it requires either a symlink to the PATH or a custom PATH.   I think OSX is really a great OS, and it is the fact that everything works so well 'out of the box' that I am stumped by such a glaring absence. The only thing that I can imagine is that (for better or worse) such a feature is prevented by open source licensing.  <comment99276> Software Update can be run from the command line with `softwareupdate`. A command line version of App Store would probably be too confusing. <comment99278> Abe - let's see if we can tighten this up to be less discussion. Most "why did Apple do X?" questions end up as a discussion where anyone's opinion is equally valid and doesn't provide value to the site other than speculation. We have [chat] rooms for discussions so if that's your intent we could move this conversation there instead of fixing this question into something objectively answerable. <comment99286> this is a related question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/53367/2153 <comment99289> The title reflects a much more awesome sentiment. What about the second paragraph? Can you document what you mean there? `softwareupdate`, `install`, `installer` and .pkg are canonical Apple provided tools for software package installation out of the box. The MAS model overlays the unix installers from a GUI perspective. Are you looking for someone to point this out or really more of why did Apple modify BSD and layer on top? Basically, although better - this question still begs clarification on "what next" It's not clear what problem you face today and are trying to solve. <comment99290> If you want a discussion on why this is closed - place to work on improving it - just ask a question on [meta] for comments / assistance in honing this question. Posting a link to [chat] also works if no one but moderators are seeing it on meta. <comment99293> @bmike meta question opened http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/1645/2153 <comment99312> I wouldn't call `brew` a package manager so much as a customizable download and install manager. MacPorts is much closer to `apt-get`, `rpm`, and others in terms of allowing package versioning, customizable installs, system integration, etc. <comment99314> Note that re native package managers and open source - OSX is built on a full OS that they open source called Darwin. Most command line programs are part of this so a 'package manager' could have built at this level. - Possibly the answer is that the OS design predates other package managers :)
