Caps Lock key mapped to a second Control key, reset after wake in Mountain Lion <body> I'm running a clean install of Mountain Lion. I have my kbdCaps Lock/kbd key mapped to a second kbdControl/kbd key.   Whenever I wake my computer back from sleep, it re-sets itself to the kbdCaps Lock/kbd key. This did not happen in Lion.  Has anyone else experienced this bug after upgrading?  <answer58684> This happens on all keyboards except the internal one. Maybe it doesn't "recognize" the keyboards as the same keyboards anymore.  <answer59012> I have the same issue on a 2010 MacBook Air with its internal keyboard. Not every time it wakes up, though. I did a clean install of Mountain Lion. I didn't have such an issue with Lion on the same machine.  <comment66477> Was this an issue in previous OS versions? Also, what keyboard are you using? <comment71040> i have the same problem. do you have Virtual Box installed? <comment79776> Same here. Worked with snow leopard, broke (i.e. not persistent across reboots anymore) after an update to mountain lion. Worked again after a fresh install of mountain lion, then suddenly broke again. <comment83160> I am also experiencing this same issue <comment83161> I have the same problem and I do have Virtual Box installed
