VMware Fusion virtual machine from a local partition <body> When you have a Windows partition on your system, VMware can see and boot a virtual machine from partition.

Is there a way to make a virtual machine and "link" the local partition?  <answer48806> This guide appears to show how to do this.  Looks like there's some manual commands on the command line to create a vmdk file with a pointer to the raw device:  http://andrewfarley.com/mac/raw-disks-from-vmware-fusion
