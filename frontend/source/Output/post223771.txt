Macbook Air doesn't turn on <body> My Macbook Air 13" (bought around a year ago) still running Yosemite suddenly halted while watching a Youtube video (without any other intensive task going on) and refused to turn on.  After ~2 hours, the laptop got turned on by itself (it was closed on my desktop without the power charger plugged in), but it was ridiculously slow to use (even moving the mouse took several seconds), and the CPU fan was running at a high speed.  I managed to get trough the Diskutil diagnostic tool which didn't reveal any problem.  After rebooting, I was't able to turn it on anymore.   Some of the symptoms listed in Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) seem to apply here:  ul liThe computer's fans run at high speed although the computer is not experiencing heavy usage and is properly ventilated./li liThe computer doesn't respond to the power button when pressed./li liThe computer sleeps or shuts down unexpectedly./li liThe computer is running unusually slowly although it is not experiencing abnormally high CPU utilisation./li /ul  However resetting the SMC, by pressing the left side strongShift-Control-Alt/strong and the power button at the same time, then releasing and pressing the power button doesn't seems to do anything, however I see that the power charger light changes it's colour after releasing the combination of the four keys mentioned above, so there's definitely a "response" from the laptop.  Did anyone experienced a similar issue? Is there anything else I could try?  Some extra information:  ul liThe power charger light turns on when plugging it./li liThe laptop had 90% of battery after rebooting for the last time./li liI don't hear the chime when attempting to turn on./li /ul  <comment271290> What color is the power charger light: amber or green? <comment271428> @IconDaemon Just after the last reboot, the light was orange, and went green after pressing the mentioned keys. Now it's always green (I assume that's because the battery is full now).
