Creating a system/service user (update-proof) <body> I want to run a couple of web apps and services on my Mac. (10.8.2 Server) For every webapp/service I create a seperate user to make it more secure. (So i can sandbox them in their home directory)  I did this already in Lion. I created a user named 'org.example.webapp.myshop' with uid 301. (and a group with the same name and gid)  With the upgrade to Mountain Lion this user got deleted, the group is still there.  2 Questions:  ol liWhy was the user deleted? First I thought it was because the periods in the name might not be allowed, but I have an com.apple.calendarserver user built-in. That's one from Apple./li liIs there a better method to create a system user./li /ol
