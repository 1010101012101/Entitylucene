How to find Mac admin password not reset Mac admin password <body> I am not a administrator and I would like to find the administrator password. I would not like to reset it however. Is there anyway to find and not reset the administrator password?  <answer176546> That's the point of the security on a computer : Without the admin password don't expect to do much, this includes getting the admin password.   #Ouroboros.  <answer235787> OS X does not store a plain-text copy of your administrator password. This makes it impossible to have the computer show you the existing password.  OS X can only test if an attempted password is the administrator password.  OS X has no way to show you the original. The original is immediately thrown away when the password is set; only a hash of the password is kept.  h1Why? Hashed Passwords/h1  Passwords are stored as mathematically derived hashes of the original. This hash makes it possible to determine if an attempted password matches the real password, but it also makes it impossible to determine the real password.  <comment208508> If it were that easy what would be the point of having one? <comment208511> LOL @ Ouroboros ;-) Catch-22 too. <comment208513> What is it you're trying to do that you need the Admin password? <comment208523> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because is about Hacking passwords. <comment208531> @Buscarì›ƒ - actually, I'm voting to leave it open as a lesson to be learned, for any future Googlers.
