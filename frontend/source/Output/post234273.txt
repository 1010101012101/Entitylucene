Problems with screen share on Mac OSX <body> I have a 2012 Macbook Pro and 2013 Mac Mini.  My local network has 2 routers attached: a Sky Hub and TP-Link.  The Sky Hub is the main router with DHCP and Wi-Fi active.  The TP-Link acts as a WiFi range extender (same SSID, different channel) as the Sky Hub won't cover the whole house.  The Mac Mini is used a headless media centre.  In order to access the Mini, I use the screen share option within Finder on the Macbook Pro.  The problem I have is that screen share only works if the Macbook Pro is connected to the TP-Link router.  If I am in range of the Sky Hub, then it simply won't connect.  The Sky Hub doesn't seem to have any options that would affect this.
