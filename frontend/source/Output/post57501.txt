How to stop AppleIDAuthAgent flooding the console log with messages about expired apple id <body> After upgrading to Mountain Lion I have noticed this message being flooded into my system console:  precodeAppleIDAuthAgent[179]: SERVER Removing certificate for Apple ID "...@???.??" dsID="XXXXX" because it has expired or been revoked. (renewCertificateForAccount()/AppleIDAuthd.cpp #143) accountCheckDispatch /code/pre  Anyone know how to fix this?  <answer57540> Try to remove and add again the apple ID attached to your user account (System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups).  <answer59404> This seems to result from deprecated MobileMe and iDisk preference files laying around. This post at the Apple discussion forum may help you delete the relevant files:  precode~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.DotMacSync*.plist.lockfile ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.idisk*.plist ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.idisk*.plist.lockfile ~/Library/Preferences/MobileMeAccounts.plist ~/Library/Preferences/MobileMeAccounts.plist.lockfile ~/Library/Prefernces/ByHost/com.apple.coreservices.appleidauthenticationinfo*.plist ~/Library/Prefernces/ByHost/com.apple.coreservices.appleidauthenticationinfo*.plist.lockfile /code/pre  Don't forget to close relevant applications (like Mail or Messages) before the deletion; it also might be a good idea to at least log out and in again afterwards.
