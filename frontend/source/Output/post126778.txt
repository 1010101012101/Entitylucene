How to delete iPad calendar events when no edit option appears <body> How can I delete iPad calendar events when no edit button appears? Clicking on events only results in "details" button.  <answer126779> Tap the event, then tap the Edit button on the top right. Scroll to the bottom and tap Delete Event. If you don't have the ability to delete the event (it's a shared calendar) then the Edit button will not appear.  <comment148500> It sounds like you are subscribed to a calendar that you cannot edit. Check and see if the events where no edit button appears are all in one calendar.
