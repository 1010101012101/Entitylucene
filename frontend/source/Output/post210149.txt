How to run a Tiger 10.4.11 virtual machine? <body> I need to access some .omf files, which were originally created in an old version of AVID DV. As far as I know, this software only ran on Tiger PPC Macs. The PowerMac PPC G5 I originally used is on it's very last legs &amp; will not reliably start up. An AVID rep told me that these old files would not be accessible with a current version of AVID and I have discovered that these files cannot be accessed with Final Cut Pro. What is my best option for getting this software running so I can access these OMF files in an AVID DV timeline?  What I have to work with:  ul lia white Intel Santa Rosa Macbook [3,1 - Build 9L31a] running Leopard/li lithe original MacBook Leopard install discs/li lia variety of non-bootable disk image clones of a PPC G5 Tiger drive w/ AVID DV installed/li lithe dongle required for AVID DV to run/li lithe original G5 PPC Tiger install discs/li lithe original AVID DV install discs/li lia Mountain Lion / Yosemite dual-boot Mac Mini/li lia 2TB blank external USB drive/li lia 1TB external Firewire drive that I can erase &amp; reformat if necessary/li liParallels &amp; Fusion for Mt.

Can you try and install AVID DV on it? <comment253621> I can try, but my memory is that the issue with that was there not being enough space on the hard drive for it. <comment253622> You may not legally virtualize Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.x as is it not allowed by its SLA and neither VMware, Parallels or VirtualBox can virtualize the PPC version of Mac OS X Tiger. <comment253623> He can't use Boot Camp because his Mac mini is dual-booting Mountain Lion and Yosemite. Running the software under Rosetta should be much easier <comment253625> To clarify, I'd create a Linux partition and within that install PearPC, which would be able to run one of the disk images I have the Tiger drive as well as access the DRM dongle? <comment253626> I'm fine with wiping the Yosemite drive, if this would work. <comment253627> If I can't legally virtualize it, how can I simply run it on the hardware I have available? <comment253628> @Kerlix, As far as I know the PPC version of Mac OS X Tiger will not run directly on an Intel Mac. <comment253629> Kerlix, I've not tried it.  But theoretically it should.  I don't know the limitations of PearPC and what features aren't implemented, sometimes DRM dongles can be a pain with emulation.
