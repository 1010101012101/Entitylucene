PBS not working on Apple TV. Other channels are fine <body> I have I believe is a second generation AppleTV. A few weeks ago, I could no longer stream PBS content. I can get all other channels without any issues.   I can get into the PBS app itself. I can see the content. I can go into settings. If I select something to watch, I sometimes even see the strikecommercial/strike emsupported by content/em that plays at the beginning of some of the streams. However, I then see the little spinner, and the screen goes blank. If I press the Apple TV Remote, I can see the frame which shows where I am in the show, and it even shows me the length of the show, but nothing plays.  I've rebooted the Apple TV by unplugging it and plugging it back in. I've switched PBS affiliates. I haven't tried completely resetting my Apple TV because that means reentering and enabling every other channel. I'm hoping to do that as a last resort.  I've seen hints on other forums that the most recent Apple TV update of PBS broke the service, but nothing solid, and nothing about what can be done to fix the issue.  Anyone else have or had these issues? Was anyone else able to work around them?   <answer282872> I have similar issues.  All works fine on the Apple TV with the exception of streaming the PBS shows.  PBS works fine on my PC.  I'm using an Apple TV2 and have a Passport subscription to PBS. We just finished watching Victoria and other Masterpiece series a while back but now, after the commercials play, I get 'Error loading Content' or Content not available now, try again later'.  <comment356504> Welcome to Ask Different!

This should be much easier.
