AppleID Not been accepted in XCode account pane <body> I've notived my Apple ID is not been accepted within XCode when I try add an Apple ID in the XCode accounts pane of preferences.  I have tested the account details in both the member ceter and itunes connect sites and the account is fine.  When I add the account details and click 'Add' I get the message:  precodejohn@abcdef.com could not sign in. Please sign in with an app-specific password. You can create one at appleid.apple.com /code/pre  Any ideas? I've updated XCode (7.2.1) and Yosemite (10.10.5), rebooted etc but same thing everytime.  Note: I have a second apple id which does NOT have a developer license, I use this for my ipad store purchases and this logs into XCode fine strangely.  John  <answer234541> Make sure the Apple ID you're using is registered as an Apple Developer, XCode does not function with normal Apple IDs since they aren't linked to Apple's developer tools.  <comment285030> Is the AppleID you're attempting to sign in with registered as an Apple Developer? <comment286740> Yep, seems I was using my non developer apple id, really got to get organised and remove the one I dont use...Cheers Slightly. Make this an answer and I will award
