Download all linked files at once from a website in Safari <body> I have build a Web Frontend for my own Server to share files with my co-workers. They can upload images and animation-videos there.  Now, if a co-worker has uploaded many files, it would be nice to download all of them all at once.   strongSo I have a webpage with, lets say, 20 links. All of them are linking to files to another folder./strong      Is there a PlugIn or anything to click once which follows the links   and downloads the files?   <answer152691> I have found this software for my own use just now and I remembered your question. That's what I have found, perhaps that can help you :  strongFolx/strong  Folx is a free download manager for Mac OS X with a true Mac-style interface.  It offers convenient downloads managing, flexible settings, etc.  Folx has a unique system of sorting and keeping the downloaded content.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rzBq9.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongiGetter/strong     Site Explorer allows exploration of the entire web or FTP sites, so   you can easily find and download files you're interested in. To   explore a HTTP, HTTPS or FTP site select the Site Explorer group item   and choose the contextual menu function "Enter Site URL" to set a site   URL. When you reach the file that you want to download double click on   it or choose the contextual menu function "Add to queue" and it will   appear in the queue for download. If you want to cancel the processing   just push the "Pause" button on the Toolbar. Site Explorer analyzes   HTML pages for all available links even looking in the JavaScript   functions, so it will show a complete list of web page contents.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wRX5.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8yxty.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  And when i was searching your question i have found this question who can help too:  How can I download all MP3 files from a web site?  SiteSucker is a great (free) application! It will allow you to download folders from a site. So, just enter in your URL and click "Download"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pc5Kx.jpg" alt="sitesucker image"     SiteSucker is a Macintosh application that automatically downloads Web sites from the Internet. It does this by asynchronously copying the site's Web pages, images, backgrounds, movies, and other files to your local hard drive, duplicating the site's directory structure. Just enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), press return, and SiteSucker can download an entire Web site.   <answer176471> Chrome/Firefox Browser answer.  Chrome/Firefox can use the HTML5 strongdownload/strong attribute.  As Far as I know Safari does not support it yet.  Since you are building the web pages. You can add the strongdownload/strong attribute to the links and also give them a class name that will help you find them.  You then use a button that runs a javascript function that will simulate clicking the links which use strongdownload/strong attribute to force the files to download instead of opening.  Example.  precode&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt;   &lt;head&gt;      &lt;title&gt;test&lt;/title&gt;       &lt;script&gt;       function downloadURLS() {           var links = document.getElementsByClassName("downloadLnk");          for(var i=0; i&lt;links.length; i++) {               links[i].click();          }       }            &lt;/script&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;   &lt;body&gt;       &lt;p&gt; &lt;!--     add the download attribute, and add the class name downloadLnk --&gt; &lt;!--The download attribute will work in Chrome, but as of yet not Safari--&gt;      &lt;a class="downloadLnk" href="subdir/1.jpeg"  download &gt; image link&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;/a&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;      &lt;a class="downloadLnk" href="subdir/2.jpeg"  download &gt; image link&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;/a&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;      &lt;a class="downloadLnk" href="subdir/3.jpeg"  download &gt; image link&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;/a&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;div&gt;          &lt;button onclick="downloadURLS()"&gt;download all&lt;/button&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; /code/pre  Also not that the images are in a sub directory.  Working Example page  <answer290463> Here is another alternative, similar to that one of Foxl.  strongDownload Shuttle/strong is a simple and lightweight download manager for macOS. It works as a stand-alone or as a browser extension. It comes with plugins for Safari and Chrome.     Download Shuttle is a blisteringly fast download accelerator and manager, and itâ€™s free! All downloads made via Download Shuttle are multi-segmented, i.e., each file is split into many smaller parts that are simultaneously being downloaded. This ensures that the speeds you experience are a lot faster as your bandwidth is maximized.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTJS6.jpg" alt="shuttle"  It is strongfree/strong. I find it more easy to use than Foxl. When compared to Foxl's free version, it also has the advantage of not having ads or popups that ask you to buy the full version.  It is being updated (apps and extensions) as of 2017.  Tested on macOS 10.12.5 and Safari 10.1.1.  <comment179985> Edit : folx added <comment313199> Folx works really nice! It has a paid version, but the free one has all the features the OP should need. I have just used to download a bunch of pdf files from a single page -- worked mac-perfectly!
