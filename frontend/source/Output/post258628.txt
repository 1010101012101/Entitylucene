Can I use SIPS to reduce the size of PNG files by reducing the number of palette colors? <body> I need to shrink PNG files like the ones generated as the default macOS screenshot. SIPS was my first stop since it's faster than any other solution but I haven't quite been able to find the right command.  This is my starting point to reformat to PNG:  precode/usr/bin/sips -s format png  "$f" --out "${f%.*}.png" /code/pre  Which options are needed?  precode--setProperty bitsPerSample  /code/pre  Bits/sample looks promising but I'm not sure what to enter here.br  Does 32 mean 32 colors in this context, for example?  Can I use SIPS to quickly reduce the number of colors to shrink file size?  <comment323437> bitsPerSample is referring to the [color depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth) of the image. <comment330133> So, if I reduced the color depth, the PNG should shrink, right? Based on the link you sent, I should set this to `--setProperty bitsPerSample 4` for 16 colors per bit or `--setProperty bitsPerSample 8` for 256, shouldn't I?
