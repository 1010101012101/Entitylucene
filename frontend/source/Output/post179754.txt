Downgrading from Yosemite to Mavericks with TimeMachine backup from another Mac <body> I have an iMac mid 2011 with Maverick which i have replaced with a iMac retina 27" with Yosemite Preinstalled. I did a Migration Assistant to transfer files from old to new mac. Now i want to downgrade the new machine from Yosemite to Mavericks. Can i use a TM backup from the old machine made AFTER the migration, to do this? (Using the OS X Utilities restoring from TM Backup).  <answer179777> Doubtful, the minimum OS for the 27" iMac is 10.10.  You can lay the TM backup down on the iMac, but it will most likely panic on the subsequent reboot.  <comment213352> Ok. Is there another way to downgrade in my situation? <comment213354> No, the newer hardware simply won't support the older OS.
