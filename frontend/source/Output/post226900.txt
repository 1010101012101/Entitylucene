How can I have spell check for one language *but NOT* for another in El Capitain? <body> I want to have spell checking ON for Greek (or any other language you have) and OFF for English.  At the System Preferences (Keyboard - Text) I have enabled Greek em(where it says "Ελληνικά (iSquare)" in the images)/em as the strongONLY/strong enabled language (I have disabled strongall the others/strong from the pop-up menu (Set Up...) and I have choose it at the same menu.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEfXF.png" alt="Set Up..."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKRqe.png" alt="Greek Selected"  So Greek spell checking works. But the problem is that when I type an strongEnglish/strong word, it spell checks that word too! (So if I type: "emhelloo/em" it changes it to "emhello/em"!)   strongThis is what I want to avoid!/strong  Is there a way to have the checking done strongonly/strong in Greek and strongnot/strong in English?  So that "Εληνικά" will become "Ελληνικά", but "helloo" will stay "helloo".  <comment275544> This may be a bug connected with using a non-Apple spellcheck dictionary. <comment275768> Maybe... but that does not help me... What can I do? <comment275804> Nothing, as far as I know.  Are there any other Greek spellcheckers available to try?  Does the problem exist in all apps including TextEdit? <comment275914> :-( ... (The same in all apps.) <comment277406> Did you restart the programs/whole system after changing the spellcheck settings? <comment277410> Have you also gone in the individual apps and checked Edit  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar to make sure the dictionary is set to Greek and not to "automatic"? <comment277915> It appears that English is always active when the overall system language is set to English. If you change the system language to Greek, the spell checker will stop checking English. <comment278150> Pit: Yes.   Tom Gewecke: Yes (otherwise it would not work anyway!)  Dictionarics Anonymous: I understand... But this is not what I want...
