mac asking password after cd in terminal <body> Recently my mac has started asking me for a password after I use codecd/code in Terminal.app (haven't tested other term apps).  strangely though, if I press kbdctrl/kbd-kbdC/kbd when the passowrd is asked, the question goes away and I'm left in the dir I was codecd/code-ing to (as one would expect).  how can I find out what this password is needed for or how to stop this? I'm using codezsh/code  strongEDIT:/strong  The terminal asks for a password at random moments, for random directories. Not a clue as to any pattern. The output is basically:  precodecd ~/Downloads Password: /code/pre  I think this started happening after I installed JewelryBox.app  <answer115087> You can run codeset -x/code to make zsh print a trace of every command it executes. When a command is executed by a function, the function name is printed. Run codeset +x/code to stop printing traces.  If something is happening when you use the codecd/code command, it can be because this is an alias or function. Check with codetype cd/code.  Zsh has a built-in feature to hook onto the codecd/code command, so wrappers around the built-in command are rarely used. If the function codechpwd/code exists, zsh runs it immediately after changing the directory. Check what the codechpwd/code function does with codewhich chpwd/code.  There are also hooks that run before and after every command: the codepreexec/code and codeprecmd/code functions. Furthermore, all these hooks have an array version, which is an array of function names. Check these arrays with codeecho $chpwd_functions/code, and if there is a function, look at its code.  <comment97401> A few more details would probably be helpful here. Does it happen with all `cd` commands or only for specific directories? If the second, any idea on what these have in common and/or what puts them apart from the others? Also posting a screenshot (or a text copy) of the message (and the `cd` part) would give some hints. <comment97414> Can you write some output in Terminal like `whence cd`, `which cd`, `echo $SHELL`. It seems this command is different than builtin <comment97436> `echo $SHELL` gives `/bin/zsh` and `which` says `cd: shell built-in command`. `whence cd` just says `cd`. I remmeber there is a `zsh` thing you can enable as to see all the commands executed when you do something, `xset` or something like that but I cannot remember exactly what. <comment97438> `set -x` that was it. `cd`-ing to a dir outputs a lot stuff, including a lot of references to rvm, rubies, ... so I think the culprit must be JewelryBox or any of it's installed rvms. <comment97447> @romeovs - consider adding an answer to your question below to help those who find this question in the future.
