Has anyone successfully got 2560 x 1600 resolution with the new macbook pros (late 2016) *over dual link dvi*? <body> So I've been using the emMini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter/em for years to connect to a DELL 3007WFP which only supports strongdual-link DVI input/strong. Now I want to connect the new macbook pro (late 2016) with thunderbolt 3 to this monitor.  There is no such thing as thunderbolt 3 to dual-link dvi. Called Apple and after one hour on the phone they told me to buy a thunderbolt 3 to thunderbolt 2 adapter in order to connect to the emMini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter/em. After a trip to the Apple Store and $29 less in my wallet that's for sure did not work!  So now I'm wondering: man can go and go back from the moon, but it can't make this work? I don't want to have to buy another monitor to use with the new macbook pro :(  Has anyone successfully got that to work? Which adapters? How did you connect them?  Below the emMini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter/em I've been using for centuries:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ku1Un.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer261843> I'm not convinced this is possible. I tried connecting the adapter you have to a USB-C to Mini Displayport adapter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016ZX5J0Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), which caused the laptop to recognize the monitor, but it did not display any image.  <answer268654> After a lot of trial and error (I've tried pretty much every adapter on the market) I have my MacbookPro (15inch) late 2016 working with my Dell 3007WFP monitor. Running at the full 2560x1600 resolution.   strongAdapters used:/strong  ul liOfficial Apple Dual DVI adapter.  /li liUSB 3.1 Type C to Mini DisplayPort/Mini DP (Female) Adapter Cable Support 4K UHD  /li liExternal powered USB hub./li /ul  strongSetup/strong   ul liThe USB of the dual dvi adapter goes into the USB hub.  /li liUSB-C plugs into the MacbookPro, the female mini display port plugs  into the dual dvi adapter./li /ul  <comment327850> The Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 doesn't support Mini-DisplayPort, you needs to get a USB-C to Mini-DisplayPort adaptor <comment337705> Could you provide a link to the adapters that you have used please? <comment362847> Would love to but stackexchange will not let me add links :(
