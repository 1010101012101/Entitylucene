If I delete music from an iPad will it affect music stored on any other iCloud-connected device? <body> Asking on behalf of my mother.  The music came on via iCloud syncing AFAIK so I wanted to make sure that removing it in one place wouldn't remove it somewhere else as we'll.  <answer112312> It shouldn't effect other devices as iCloud does not automatically sync music between devices other than downloading newly purchased music to all devices if you have iOS configured that way. (Settings  iTunes &amp; App Store  automatic downloads  music "on")  That automatic download is one way and one time only not perpetual.
