Internet recovery mode cannot connect to wpa2 network <body> As above  I've reached the internet recovery screen and entered the correct password for the wpa2 network but all I have is the network selection drop down and a spinning globe with no loading bar.  What can I do to troubleshoot this ?  <answer138732> Problem was troubleshooted and resolved as a DHCP error.   A static IP address had been assigned to the windows partition for my mac. This cloned mutltiple assigned addresses and shut out other devices.  Solution : removing the staticly assigned ip address resolved the issue.  <comment163203> cycle the router on/off
