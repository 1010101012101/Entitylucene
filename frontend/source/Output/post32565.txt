How can I remove Firefox using terminal? <body> I'm a beginner with Mac OS X. Would somebody please tell me how to fully uninstall Firefox using Terminal on Mac OS X Lion?  I'm experiencing hangs and crashes with Firefox 5.0.1, so I want to remove it then re-install it.  Thanks so much in advance.  <answer32566> To remove Firefox.app:  ul liLogin with an administrator account/li licodesudo rm -rf /Applications/Firefox.app//code/li /ul  You get the same result by just dragging the Firefox app from /Applications/ to the trash.   If the crashes continue after reinstalling, deleting preferences and support files in the user library may help:  ul licode~/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox*/code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/code/li licode~/Library/Mozilla/code/li licode~/Library/Caches/Firefox/code/li /ul  <answer32567> It's very probable that your profile is corrupt, rather than Firefox itself (in which case, deleting Firefox won't help as any new installation will use the corrupt profile).   Creating a new profile may help - the safest way to do that is using the Profile Manager.  <answer32615> You might also consider uninstalling it using AppZapper, which will remove the app and all of its configuration files.  There is a fully-functional free trial available.  <comment37280> please can you list me those files when you get back home <comment37289> @JAHelia, you could use a program like [AppCleaner](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/471/1453) to do the search & deletion for you. <comment37558> thank you so much patrix for your help.
