Not receiving push notifications for iCloud 2-factor authentication <body> I followed the instructions on this sixcolors.com blog post to disable and re-enable 2-factor authentication on my iCloud account in order to upgrade to the "newer" version.  However, now when I attempt to log in on the web or on a device, I no longer receive a push notification with a 2-factor authentication code on my devices.  I am able to receive a text message or generate a code from Settings but I no longer receive an automatic push notification with the code.  Has anyone else encountered this issue, or have any idea what I could do to fix it?  I tried disabling and re-enabling 2-factor authentication on my iCloud account once more but it didn't help.  <comment302507> Are you running iOS 10 on any device connected to your iCloud account? There seems to be a beta bug at the moment with 2-factor auth if you have an iOS 10 device registered on your Apple ID. <comment302508> @grgarside No, I have not installed iOS 10 or macOS Sierra on any of my devices.  My iPhone is on iOS 9 and my mac is on El Capitan.  Thanks for the info though. <comment302511> It appears that 2-factor authentication push notifications are now delivered to my iPhone, a few hours after enabling it.  So this issue seems to be resolved.
