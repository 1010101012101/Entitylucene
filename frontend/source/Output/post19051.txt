Is there a way to turn off autosave feature in Lion OS X? <body> How can I turn off the autosave feature on all applications in lion?  <answer19052> Is this what you're looking for?  http://www.pubarticles.com/article-2-ways-to-disable-autosave-and-versions-on-mac-os-x-lion-1311670708.html  : Disable Autosave and Versions on Lion - Setting      ol   liGo to System Preferences  General /li   liUntick "Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps". /li   liThen reboot./li   /ol   <comment20866> Odd. It probably is. I wonder what's the difference between time machine and a setting... <comment31613> This answer is completely wrong; this only disables the automatic reopening of windows when you quit an app. It does NOT disable autosaving. <comment42373> If you're looking how to disable Versions (not Autosave), here's the procedure: [How to disable Versions in OS X Lion](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/37363/14994) <comment59936> Since there is now a correct answer at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27544/disable-auto-save-and-versions-in-mac-os-x-lion/, I flagged this as a duplicate, seeing as this question has an incorrect answer..
