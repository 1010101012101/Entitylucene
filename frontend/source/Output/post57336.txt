Why might one USB port be problematic on a MacBook Pro? <body> h2Background/h2  I sometimes find that the strongfrontmost of three ports/strong on a 2009 MacBookPro5,2 is less capable than the other ports.   This frontmost port with an independent bus seems:   ul ligood enough to charge an iPhone 1 /li lisometimes problematic for devices that have their own power sources/li lisometimes problematic for simple bus-powered devices, for example a Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical./li /ul  Maybe more problematic when the laptop is booted from something other than the internal drive (Serial-ATA).   In some problem situations, reconnecting the device to an alternative port might work around … at least temporarily.   I read of comparable problems with:   ul lia 2010 MacBookPro6,2/li lia 2011 MacBookPro8,1./li /ul  h2Expectation/h2  One port should provide strongup to 1100 mA at 5 V/strong subject to the conditions given in Apple article HT4049.   h1Question/h1  Why might just one USB port of a MacBook Pro be problematic with a device that draws little power, or with a device that has an independent power supply?  h2Environment/h2  MacBookPro5,2 with 8 GB memory, checked twice with Apple Service Toolkit (AST) by an Apple authorised service provider.

Apple Computers and Displays: Powering peripherals through USB – article HT4049.   hr  Some time after posting this question I learnt that USB is amongst the focus areas for Build 12B13 of OS X 10.8.1. I'll review this question, and answers, after 10.8.1 is released.   <answer57352> The port may be dirty or worn.  In that case it may be a contact issue, the port might have dirt, corrosion, etc. building up on the contacts. I would try cleaning the USB port with an electrical contact cleaner or  isopropyl alcohol and see if the problems persist. If it does then I would suggest there may be an issue with the USB controller or the physical port itself, causing the misbehavior.

Have you read through this article on how Apple detects the first device that requests higher power and enables that power on some, but not all ports?  ul liApple Computers and Displays: Powering peripherals through USB/li /ul  I know you have linked to it, but the 500 mA is subject to measurement errors on the computer side - so plugging in a device can draw more current than the device says it should. Similarly, the measurement side where the Mac determines the actual power draw could be flakey or failing. This sort of thing isn't tested in the system diagnostics. You would need a test set / oscilloscope / engineering lab to really measure these currents with enough resolution to pin down exactly what is happening.  It could be just the order in which the system decides to detect a device attached. Once you have ruled that out and have a repeatable issue - you might need to have the Mac checked for service if it isn't producing power as expected. Now that you know that the order in which devices are plugged can affect things, perhaps this will help narrow down if the enhanced power is correctly available to some (changeable) subset of the ports and hubs made by Apple.  There is no easy answer other than being precise and narrowing down exactly which devices are causing errors and statistically determining/isolating whether it's the devices or the port that is out of spec and needs to be replaced.  <comment65858> Hi Graham. It's the 15" 6,2 model, 2.4GHz. Cheers <comment66148> Thanks - the MacBookPro5,2 has been checked twice with AST. With one affected peripheral, it should be simple enough to check power. With other affected peripherals it may be a long time before comparable checks can be made. <comment66396> Are computer-side measurement errors due to problems with (a) integral hardware, (b) OS X, or both? I see that Boot Camp can not provide extra power so I doubt that Windows can be better for measurement, but I wonder whether booting something other than OS X will allow more accurate measurement.
