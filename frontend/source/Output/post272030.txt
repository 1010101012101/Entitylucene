How to Monitor Internet Connection? <body> I have a problem with my home network where the internet is suddenly down for a few minutes and then works fine again. I would like to determine where the problem is (switch, router, access point). We have a pretty standard setup, with a router and a gigabit ethernet switch in the basement. And 3 Access Points (Unifi AP Pro), one on every floor. The coverage is fine. However we do have this issue where the Wifi is done maybe once or twice a day.  To determine where the problem is, I would like to somehow monitor the network, at each point, that is straight from the router, from the switch, and from each AP.  Does anyone know how to do this?  <comment341912> Can you provide some more details on your config and if you are using WiFi? It sounds like a poor wifi signal could be the issue. <comment341916> @n1000 I think I know what you mean, we used to have just one AP, and we would get disconnected maybe every ten minutes, but just for a few seconds. But now with 3 AP's we have very good coverage, and this shouldn't be a problem anymore right? <comment341917> If you have any kind of interference (e.g. neighbor's wifi, microwave), these dropouts are quite typical. Have a look at [this article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202663) (especially the Performance monitor tool). <comment341920> @n1000 thanks i will try the wifi monitoring, but would interference really kill the hole network? The dropouts don't occur just at one client, all the AP's are down
