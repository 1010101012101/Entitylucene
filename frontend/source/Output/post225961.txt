iTunes: subscribe to a podcast without downloading it? <body> I listen to podcasts on iTunes (on OS X 10.11.3 BTW).  There, I said it.  I want to make a list of podcast channels I like so I can find them easily and quickly, but I want to emstream/em them, not emdownload/em them.  Apparently if I subscribe to a channel iTunes will try to download stuff -- I do not want this to happen.  If I am not online I will not listen to podcasts.  Any idea on how to achieve this?  I tried and failed, and could not goole an answer.  In case it is not 100% clear, I am using a Mac, not a phone.  <answer225976> Go to the podcast page in your iTunes Library by selecting it in the menu bar, then click the gear next to the title, then, under "This Computer", select Download Episodes  Off
