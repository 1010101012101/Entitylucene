Essential Networking Commands <body> I'm used to working with emLinux/em so I like being able to do as much as possible from the comfort of my strongTerminal.app/strong embash shell./em      So.. What are the emessential networking commands/em &amp; utilities native to emMac OS X?/em    If that's potentially too broad, the main goal is just to be able to strongemjoin/connect/em/strong to a emWLAN Access Point/em and the emInternet./em     What (I think) I know so far is this:      ol   liThere is no strongcodeip/code/strong, strongcodeiw/code/strong or strongcodeiwconfig/code/strong. There is an strongcodeifconfig/code/strong./li   liThere is no strongcodess/code/strong utility. There is a strongemBSD/strong-style/em  strongcodenetstat/code/strong utility; but it's considerably different to strongemGNU/strong-proper/em.  /li   liThere is a poorly documented strongemIEEE 802.11/em/strong utility; named strongcodeairport/code/strong.br   I have it symbolically-linked (strongcodelink -s/code/strong) to my default strongcode$PATH/code/strong. (i.e:strongcode/bin/airport/code/strong)/li   /ol   <answer203156> Looks like codenetworksetup/code and codeairport/code are your best bets.  run codeifconfig/code to find network interfaces,br then codeairport scan/code to find available networks,br and then codenetworksetup -setairportnetwork INTERFACE SSID PASSWORD/codebr where INTERFACE, SSID, and PASSWORD are replaced by the proper items. It's not the most elegant method, but it works.  <comment245126> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/27743/discussion-on-question-by-tjt263-essential-networking-commands).
