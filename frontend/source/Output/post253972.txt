how can I add a personalized symbol on I Cal <body> I would like to be able to record on my calendar a quick symbol to indicate that I exercised that day.  Is that possible?  <answer253981> There are several possibilities to add symbols to iCal/Calendar.app:  ol liUse strongEmojis/strong. Emojis are Unicode characters and will be displayed without special software. Use Cmd + Ctrl + Space to insert emojis or any other special character./li liUse the strongfind function/strong. Use a unique name for your event ("Exercise"), go to month view (Cmd + 3) and search for your event (Cmd + F)/li liUse a strongseparate calendar/strong to hide your other calendar temporarily. You will only see your exercise events./li /ol  You cannot add graphics to a events' title so it stands out easily. But I think using emojis as the first character for the title could work in your case.  Happy exercising!  <comment316139> Is it a stock symbol or a custom one that you created?  If it's just a regular symbol then it's only text and you should be able to enter it anywhere. <comment316189> Like ⚽️⚾️⛳️⛷⛸⛹  ?
