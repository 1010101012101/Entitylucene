Trash missing from Dock <body> I can't find my Trash folder on my Mac â€” it isn't on my Dock and I really don't know where to find it. I'm new to OS X. Does anyone know where I can find my Trash? I can put items in my Trash, but I want to empty some files not all of the files that are in there.  <answer122716> You shouldn't be able to delete the Trash folder from your Dock. To put it back, reset your Dock settings:  ol liOpen Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)/li liRun the following command to delete the Dock preferences file:  precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist /code/pre/li liLog out and back in./li /ol  <answer123261> I think you should first use codekillall Dock/code using Terminal.  This will reset your dock. If this doesn't work then you should download a 3rd party application such as DragThing.   Then logout and log back in, and start using DragThing.
