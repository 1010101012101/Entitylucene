Xcode appears to be installed but xcodebuild is unusable <body> I was had to reinstall Xcode 4 and now I'm getting message codeXcode appears to be installed but xcodebuild is unusable;/code and codexcodebuild exists but failed to execute/code all the time when I try to install stronganything/strong using ports:  pre ash-3.2$ sudo port install wget Password: Warning: xcodebuild exists but failed to execute Warning: configured user/group adm does not exist, will build as root Warning: Xcode appears to be installed but xcodebuild is unusable; some ports will likely fail to build.

How can I fix it (I've already reinstalled Xcode)?  hr  strongUpdate:/strong codeport/code worked fine even without codexcodebuild/code, I think MacPorts uses codemake/code and it showed this message just to make me know that I may have a problems with Xcode.  That's interesting. I've tried code… xcode-select …/code but for some reason it newer worked even after reboot, but today it worked :|. It asked me if I want to accept the license agreement and after I accepted it codexcodebuild/code become functional. So now I can accept answer and thank everybody.  <answer46436> Did you run codesudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/code? This message: codeerror: can't exec '/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild'/code is telling you that your system is looking for xcodebuild in `/Developer/usr/bin/' but as of Xcode 4.3 (the one that's installed from the App Store) it's located in the Xcode.app bundle which is in /Applications.  strongEdit/strong  In a comment to your question you say you've run codesudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/code. Now run codexcode-select -print-path/code and make sure it says "/Applications/Xcode.app".   Also, you may need to download the command line tools separately. (I don't know from first-hand experience because I'm stuck on Snow Leopard for the moment so I haven't installed Xcode 4.3.)  <answer46755> As stated here https://trac.macports.org/wiki/ProblemHotlist, you need to run:  precodesudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer /code/pre  <answer60977> I had the same problem. After upgrading to Mountain Lion and upgrading Xcode to version 4.4.1 including the command-line tools, I could not call xcodebuild from the terminal anymore.  Then I stumbled upon a setting in Xcode's preferences where I had to choose which command-line tools I wanted to use, a bit silly since there were only one option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Ncd3.png" alt="enter image description here"  http://thomas.bindzus.me/2012/08/17/after-upgrading-to-mountain-lions-problems/  I found this to be the easiest way to restore my command-line tools.  <answer74976> you need to create simple "mac os x" project using "command line tools", after that you will be able to download command line tools from xcode-pref's-downloads in components. it's size 115.6MB  <comment53054> As far as I know, XCode 3 was installed in /Developer, but XCode 4 is installed as an Application in /Applications. (I haven't installed XCode 4 yet) Are you sure XCode 3 was properly uninstalled? <comment53057> I've never had Xcode 3 on this computer. I've reinstalled Xcode 4 from App Store after removing older Xcode 4 which didn't wanted to start. <comment53064> You might try what SSteve suggests. My guess is that there is a file somewhere that thinks that you have XCode 3 installed. :| <comment53069> D'oh it was in my question. I've just copied it without looking :( I've ran xcode-select but it didn't hellped yet. <comment53504> Just a tip that’s unrelated to your problem: you may want to use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) instead of MacPorts. <comment87059> Can you describe in a bit more details what you mean with the first sentence? How would one do that? <comment263178> // , Thanks for the command and the link, @Gabriele Bartolini. I had a question, though, to which I hope you might know the answer. Why not just `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app`, or, in the case of Xcode Beta users, just `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app`? Why does this answer add the additional `/Contents/Developer`? <comment263179> // , This is an interesting idea, @Serj. May we know more?
