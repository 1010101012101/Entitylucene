Toggle language by pressing Shift + Command <body> I've moved from PC to Mac and I'm used to pressing codeShift + Ctrl/code, while on Mac I have to press codeCtrl + Space/code. This is a bit frustrating (probably because I've only used it for 2 days), so I opened System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts and tried to change the shortcut to codeShift + Command/code and for some reason it refuses to change.   I tried to test some other shortcuts such as codeCommand + Z/code and it works fine. I'd still like to change it to codeShift + Command/code. Is there a way I can achieve this?  <answer283220> With macOS' system shortcuts you can't set keyboards shortcuts solely using modifier keys.  You need to specify an additional (non-modifier) key for macOS to accept and save your shortcut.  Sierra does have an extra setting (in system prefs/keyboard/input sources) for switching between certain keyboards via Caps Lock alone, but that does not help solve your problem.  <answer283229> The best way to change the way to shift between languages from the default is as follows:  Open System Preferences and tap Keyboard: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NXPUY.png" alt="Press Keyboard from System Preferences"  Then tap Shortcuts, then from the side list tap "Input Sources", then "Select Next Source": img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MBsRh.png" alt="ShortCuts &gt; Input Sources &gt; &quot;select next source&quot;"  *Note you will have to choose something like CNTRL-SHIFT-1 or another key combo than shift-space, but you can play around with it and find a combo that works for you.  strongEdit:/strong If you want to do what you want by only pressing control shift, you might be able to do that by creating an applescript which toggles the languages and using a 3rd party hot key app on the appstore. I don't advise this, but it would be conceivably possible. For the sake of convenience, I have attached such an applescript that you can use for this purpose where if you map say control shift to this applescript, it will execute the CMD space code (or you can change it another code which doesn't conflict with spotlight (my personal recommendation):  precodetell application id "com.apple.systemevents" keystroke (key code 49 using command down) end tell /code/pre  <comment357021> I don't think so, these are two modifier keys and are used in other shortcuts. For example `cmd` + `shift` + `tab`. <comment357054> @TomGewecke True. It still does not map the shortcut to Shift + Cmd, as requested by OP, though. <comment357060> You should delete this answer, as it makes it look like you did not read the question, and also that you do not understand the issue.  The poster says he already did what you suggest but it did not work.  It did not work because the Red Text in your answer is WRONG.  You cannot press any key combo you want -- some, like the one mentioned by the poster in his subject line, do not work.  So your answer is both mistaken and unhelpful. <comment357436> Thanks Tom. Edited it to better answer the question. <comment357486> You should still delete all of your answer except for the Edit, as it is just wrong (red text) and useless (since the poster had already tried it).
