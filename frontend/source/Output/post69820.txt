typing a backtick on Mac OS X Snow Leopard <body> I have had a hunt around the net for this, but cannot find an answer - how do I type a backtick on Mac OSX Snow Leopard? I have a Macbook from late-2010.  The backtick character is one I use on a regular basis on StackExchange.  <answer69822> I presume you don't have the English keyboard layout. You need to set up the U.S. Input Source, similar to what is described here (actually it's the other way around, you want to Check U.S.): How do I disable the Russian keyboard layout in software?  Then select that Layout and press the key right to left Shift.  <answer69882> On an US keyboard, it is right next to Shift.  <answer80363> Had the same issue with non-English keyboard as well. Turns out it is rather easy to customize PressAndHold feature introduced in Lion.

I was hoping the photos would help.  I added my answer since the majority of the other answers were incorrect in suggesting that the single quote key was a backtick as requested by the OP. Hope It helps someone :)
