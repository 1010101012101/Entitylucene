How does the "Unicode Hex Input" input source work? <body> How can I enter a character using that input source? I tried entering a tab character with kbd⌥/kbd+kbd0/kbdkbd0/kbdkbd0/kbdkbd9/kbd, but I didn't get anything. Viceversa, with kbd⌥/kbd+kbd9/kbdkbd9/kbdkbd9/kbdkbd9/kbd, I get 香.    Am I doing anything wrong, or doesn't the input source allow to enter control codes?   I tested those codes on Firefox 4.  <answer11127> You are right by pressing kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbd0/kbdkbd0/kbdkbd0/kbdkbd9/kbd.  My guess would be that Firefox, like many browsers, doesn't like tab characters (especially with forms). Try in TextEdit; it should work there.  <answer36350> They are Unicode hex codes, see http://unicode.org/  <comment11628> Make sure you're using the hex codes for the characters. <comment11630> The ASCII code for the tab character is 9. <comment11638> Safari accepts the tab characters entered in that way, but Firefox and Opera seem to not like them. <comment73061> Firefox seems to have built its own keyboard input system, as many of the standard OS X key controls don't work properly there, like control-O, control-V, control-Y, and control-T.  It's not surprising that Unicode Hex Input doesn't work, either.  :-(
