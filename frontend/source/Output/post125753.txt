27" iMac won't stay asleep <body> My 27" iMac wakes up from sleep randomly, even though I went through the "energy saver" preference pane, and bluetooth is only active for my mouse and keyboard.  What could be causing this?  <answer125758> In code/Applications/Utilities//code run Terminal.app, then type this command:  precodesyslog |grep -i "Wake reason" /code/pre  What do you see?  The codes listed here might give you a clue as to what is going on: http://osxdaily.com/2010/07/17/why-mac-wakes-from-sleep/  <answer125769> go to safari in the top left hand corner and-prefrences-enable javascript. and turn down your brightness and turn it off then turn it back on and it shouldnt do that again.  <comment147207> Can you please run `pmset -g assertions` in Terminal (`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`) and post the output in a comment? <comment147333> ehc2 appears about once an hour, i tried unchecking "wake using bluetooth mouse and keyboard" but didnt change a thing overnight.
