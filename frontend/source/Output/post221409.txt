Where is my .bashrc file in a dd image? <body> I created an "emergency" image of my entire HD using the procedure explained in  Recover a dead hard drive using dd.  I spent a lot of time fine tuning my .bashrc and .profile files, but I cannot find them in the image. Do you know where it should be located? I already looked in a folder with my user name and in a directory called "Mac".  UPDATE:  The output is that I have a .dmg file with thousands of crazy files and directories that I cannot mount in my mac (How to mount a DMG image created with dd?), so I am using 7zip in a windows machine to explore the image file.   <answer221411> You can make a find command :  precodesudo find /Volumes/YOUR_DD_NAME/* -name ".bashrc" -print; say finish /code/pre  It's working for me with my .zshrc  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDnt9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that the command take a while, codesay finish/code is just more convenient ;)  <comment268066> Th problem is that I cannot mount the image on my mac, so I am using 7zip in a Windows machine to explore the image file. <comment268067> So your .bashrc is certainly located into /Users/YOUR_NAME/.bashrc <comment268070> That was my obvious guess, but there is no such directory!!! <comment268071> Obviously ^^ And you can't boot on your image ? It is the more convenient way to find what you want --- EDIT : Apparently you can't :/ <comment268072> No, the whole thing started because I was not able to boot my mac, so I used dd on the terminal available in the recovery partition. So I have a .dmg file with a bunch of damaged files. At least I was able to recover some of my files. <comment268073> Perhaps you can use a recovery tool like DataRescue.com or http://hyperlogos.org/page/Recovering-damaged-CDs-or-DVDs-Linux <comment268077> Please add a screenshot of 7zip exploring the raw dd file.
