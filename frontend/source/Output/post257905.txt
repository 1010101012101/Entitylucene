How to add an icon to a keyboard layout? <body> I am using ukelele to create some custom keyboard layouts.  I have created a code.icns/code file which contains an image I would like to represent this keyboard layout.  How do I get my macOS Sierra MB Pro to associate this keyboard layout with this icon file? I cannot find an option in ukelele, if there is even one.  <answer257907> I am not sure if ukelele itself implements a way to do this, but the solution turned out to be trivial.  Locate your code.bundle/code file which is being used. Mine was at code/Library/Keyboard Layouts/#British.bundle/code.  With a terminal, codecd/code into the Contents and then Resources subdirectories of the bundle. Now the command codeopen ./code should open finder at this location.   Have fun replacing the code.icns/code file within.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwBY1.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <answer257914> You just give the .icns file the same name you gave your .keylayout file and locate them in the same direcory.  <comment322274> Seriously wtf? Is there a bot/person who just goes around and downvotes on every single one of my questions?
