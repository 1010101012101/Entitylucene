Jailbroken iPhone stuck on boot screen <body> I tried to reload Cydia, which stopped working on my jailbroken iPhone 4. I downloaded "Redsnow" and "Ipsw 4.3.2", which worked, until I went to use and downloaded an app with Cydia.   I did not realize that this jailbreak version needed to be tethered to reboot!  So i put my iPhone back in sleep mode and boot from Redsnow only to have it get locked in the logo boot mode for 2 days now! Yesterday I panicked and downloaded the latest update from iTunes and did a factory instal with no avail - still in this boot logo loop   How can I fix this and use my phone?  <answer35199> You need to first put your phone into DFU Mode. Then, run Redsnow, go to "Extras" and select "Just Boot".  <answer53475> My suggest would be to restore your iPhone using iTunes and re-jailbreak it using the latest Absinthe which supports jailbreaking the most recent iOS 5.1.1.
