Number of cpus and cores in macbook pro? <body> On Macbook Pro, I clicked "about this mac", and it shows that     Number of Processors:   1br     Total Number of Cores:  2   I thought I have more cores and cpus, because when I created a virtual machine in Virtualbox, it allows me to specify up to 4 cpus to the virtual machine.  So how can I find out the number of cpus and cores on this laptop?  codelshw/code doesn't work in bash under Mac. Is there some similar command?  Thanks.  <answer244486> The simplest way is to launch Activity Monitor - in Applications/Utilities  Then hit kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd 3 /kbd which will open the CPU History.br Then you just count the stripes ;-)br It counts virtual cores, so includes HT [Hyper-threading] cores.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDum5.png" width="280"   <comment301319> You said, "_I didn't think single-core CPUs ever had Hyper-threading_", well they did and have had so for quite some time... my Pentium 4 processor had Hyper-Threading Technology <comment301322> Those are **virtual CPU cores** that VirtualBox is showing and the general rule of thumb is is to not assign more then half of the virtual CPU cores available, thus allow the Host to maintain good functionality while simultaneously running the virtual machine. <comment301324> How many Macs had Pentium 4 CPUs???? First Intel Mac was a Core 2 Duo. <comment301330> Didn't say it was a Mac, just showing the technology has been around for quite a while. <comment301335> @user3439894  ... random data...  There was never a Mac with a single core Intel... so how does throwing spurious data help this issue in any way, shape or form? <comment301339> You were the one that said "_If About this Mac shows 1 Processor, 2 Cores, then I'm a bit confused as to what your machine may actually be. I didn't think single-core CPUs ever had Hyper-threading._" and as far as I'm concerned that is a hardware related statement not necessarily a Apple computer statement and I merely offered a comment that "_they did and have had so for quite some time... my Pentium 4 processor had Hyper-Threading Technology_" and factually accurate information about a CPU that you yourself brought up is hardly spurious data! Continued in next comment... <comment301340> That said the OP said 1 processor and 2 cores, which the very first MacBook Pro had, so I don't know why you're say something like "_I didn't think single-core CPUs ever had Hyper-threading._" in the first place.  Now granted the the first MacBook Pro didn't support Hyper-Threading Technology but it had 2 cores, so why are you even bringing up single-core CPUs anyway!? IIRC MacBook Pro's with 1 processor and 2 cores supporting Hyper-Threading Technology started around 2010. <comment301358> so why didn't you just say that in the first place?
