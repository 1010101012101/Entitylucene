show long filenames immediately in Mountain Lion when hovering mouse and key press <body> In Leopard, at the finder, when a file/folder had a long filename (and it truncated it with an ellipsis "â€¦"), I just had to press the option (alt) key and hover the cursor on that file/folder, and it would show a tooltip with the full filename.  In Mountain Lion (10.8.2) I can't do that, and I haven't found a way to get the full filename without selecting the actual file and going to "Get Info".  So, is there a way to get the full filename without selecting the file/folder in Mountain Lion just like it could be done in Leopard (immediately get the full filename tooltip via a keyboard key and hovering the cursor over the file/folder)?  <answer79551> The tooltips are still shown in column view and icon view if you hover an item for about two seconds (no need to hold option). I don't know about list view though.  You can also select an item and press return to enter renaming mode.  <comment91845> Thanks for the tip, but that is not the same as the *immediate* tooltip achieved with the option key (I shoudl have stated it better, I already have), and also it doesn't work in list view. Is there a similar way to the option key?
