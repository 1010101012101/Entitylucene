Keyboard Shortcuts For Navigating Spotlight? <body> I find keyboard shortcuts very useful, and whilst I know quite a few of the "general ones", I don't know any concerning using strongSpotlight/strong with the exception of  strongCommand-SpaceBar/strong to launch it.  What other keyboard shortcuts exist (if any) with regards to using strongSpotlight/strong (that may make things "lightening fast" when using it) ?  (I'm sure the number of shortcuts available cannot be that extensive - if they exist that is).  <answer100130> h24 Basic Spotlight Shortcuts/h2  These are the most basic shortcuts to use Spotlight:  Open Spotlight menu – Command+Space  Open Spotlight in the Finder – Command+Option+Space  Clear Spotlight search box – Escape  Close Spotlight menu – Escape twice  h27 Spotlight Usage &amp; Navigation Keyboard Shortcuts/h2  These shortcuts are for interacting and navigating within Spotlight search results:  Open first search item – Return  Navigate search results – Arrow Up and Arrow Down  Open to location of first search item in Finder – Command+Return  Get Info on search item – Command+I  Show Quick Look Preview of Spotlight results – Command key or hover with the Mouse cursor (OS X 10.7 and later only)  Show path/location of search result – Command+Option while hovering over search result  Jump categories in search results – Command+Arrow Up or Command+Arrow Down  Take a look at this for more details.   <answer100132> ul li⌘R or ⌘↩ reveals an item in Finder/li li⌘I shows an information window/li li⌘Y shows a Quick Look window/li li⌘D selects a dictionary result/li li⌘B selects a web search result/li li⌘K selects a Wikipedia result/li li⌘T selects the top result/li li⌘, opens Spotlight preferences/li liHolding command shows a preview popover/li liHolding option and command shows the full path of a file in a preview popover/li li⌘↓ moves to the next section and ⌘↑ moves to the previous section/li li⌃↓, end, or page down selects the last item/li /ul  <comment145905> This is life-changing! <comment146021> "Holding command shows a preview popover" Thank you!
