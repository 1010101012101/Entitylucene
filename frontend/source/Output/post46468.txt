PL/SQL Mac compiler or Mac OS X compatible softwares <body> How can I run PL/SQL in Mac OS X Lion. I couldn't find any compatible application for mac to run PL/SQL. Please give some suggestion.  <answer46472> I've used RazorSQL in the past for MSSQL/MySql/Postgres connectivity, but not for Oracle.  It's a good product for the price (if you consider how much Toad costs, but is not as feature rich)  <comment53113> Ok thank u. I couldn't find any procedure to load PL/SQL in `RAZORSQL` & I'm running on trail version. <comment53116> Can you clarify what you mean by "I couldn't find any procedure to load PL/SQL" ? <comment53120> I'm sorry finally I found how to run PL/SQL.
