"Internet Passwords" gone in keychain and safari <body> Today I noticed that a lot (!) of my stored "internet passwords" disappeared from my keychain. Plus, some of the few remaining are mixed up (wrong domain for the account).  I'm using Mac OS 10.10.2 and Safari 8.0.2. I'm not using and have never used the iCloud keychain (disabled on all devices).  In Safari, no passwords at all show up in the Preferences-Passwords. The checkbox for the auto-fill is checked and has always been.  In addition to that mess, I cannot even store new passwords via Safari. It asks, but nothing is stored. I already checked and repaired Privileges.   I tried to restore an old login.keychain from ~/Library/Keychains but that also didn't have the internet passwords in it.  Does anyone have any idea what could have happened and if the "Internet Passwords" are maybe stored somewhere else than in the login.keychain? I have several Backups here, but couldn't locate them in any of them.  Thanks!
