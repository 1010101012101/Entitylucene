Change video Release Date in iTunes <body> Until now, I could change Release Date on videos without problem. But, from now, If the video hasn't Release Date field, when I tried to edit, it always appears code05/06/05/code on that field and I could not edit it.  Is this a general issue?   Any way to update that field?  strongiTunes 12.0.1.26/strong  <comment190713> give us more details like iTunes version? <comment190715> thanks, so what do you think why is there no Release date to start with? <comment190717> Don't know, but it's irrelevant. Files with a correct release data has not accepted changes on this field. <comment190737> ok, since it is irrelevant maybe someone else can help you. good luck <comment190790> @Buscarì›ƒ please don't get me wrong. I meant, the fact that files have or haven't release date is the irrelevant thing, because in both cases the release date can't be changed. And I really don't know why those files hasn't release date, mostly because were downloaded from internet I suppose.
