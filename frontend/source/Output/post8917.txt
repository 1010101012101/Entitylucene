Sugar.  <answer8918> Did you try to press the eject button while booting ?  Just after you press the power button, press and hold Eject.  <answer8921> According to Apple documentation, you can either use eject and F12 as mentioned before, or keep your mouse button pressed.  If you keep codeoption/code pressed during boot, it should ask you from what disk you want to boot. That might be a better solution.  Are you sure this is the issue though?  <comment9467> Did you mean ejecting the CD/DVD? <comment9468> I am using USB ordinary keyboard not apple's standard keyboard. <comment9469> I tried to press ALT, I also tried F12. But none of them worked. <comment9470> Yes ! @HMage - I am not able to eject DVD. <comment9471> @sugar keeping the F12 key pressed didn't work? <comment9472> @sugar you could try to go to an Apple Store, and ask them to plug an Apple keyboard just to eject the DVD.
