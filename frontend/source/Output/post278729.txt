Different keyboard mapping on external keyboard <body> Currently I have a challenging keyboard setup. My MacBook Pro has a codefr_FR/code (French AZERTY) keyboard, but the layout is currently set to codefr_CA/code (Canadian QWERTY). Even if the keys are not labelled right, it works perfectly fine for me who's used to a French Canadian keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6gWPW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, I recently bought an external Mac keyboard that turns out to be codeen_US/code (American QWERTY). I would like it to also have the codefr_CA/code "feel", but it seems to behave differently – seems like it simply applies the locale from my physical keyboard without "assigning" the keys based on the different layout that codeen_US/code is compared to codefr_FR/code.  How could I make sure that the location of the keys on the codeen_US/code honours the layout of a codefr_CA/code, different from the physical codefr_FR/code keyboard?  <answer278742> The mapping of the input source you have selected in the "flag" menu should always apply to both the internal and external keyboards.  The standard US keyboard has one less key, so it will be slightly different:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UODE.png" alt="enter image description here"  If yours does not behave that way, something is wrong.    <comment350808> Your external keyboard should have the same mapping as French Canadian CSA, except that it might not have the extra key next to Z, in which case identical behavior is not possible.  Are you saying that the external keyboard produces none of the accented characters shown in your graphic at the right edge? <comment350812> It is normally really difficult to have an external keyboard use a different mapping than the internal one.  There are various questions here from people who actually want to do that, and it requires some effort using the  Karabiner app.  Do you have that on your machine by chance?
