Has anyone figured out how to prevent Firefox from losing "Hide" and other Firefox menu functions? <body> I've noticed recently that Firefox no longer is showing items in the 'Firefox menu' other than 'Quit'. As such, it seems that I can no longer hide the application with that menu or the Command-H keyboard shortcut (you can still right-click on the dock icon and hide there).  I did notice there is a Bugzilla item for it, but it seems much older than when I first saw this problem appear. As much as I've been a supporter of Firefox over the years, this is kind of killing it for me and I might switch.  Has anyone had this problem and found a way to get around or fix it?  <comment228045> The behavior you've described occurred once when I last updated Firefox to 38.0.5 however once I quit and reopened the menus were back to normal. <comment228099> Disable auto-update.
