Lost game progress after reinstalling app despite app having Game Center integration <body> I used to play emThe Sims Freeplay/em on my iPad, but after playing the game for a week I deleted it, but I did not remove it from Game Center. I re-installed the game, but I couldn't continue my progress. Game Center is still showing the progress of my old account, but I couldn't continue it. Does Game Center save my The Sims Freeplay progress?  If it doesn't, why did it save for my emClash of Clans/em account? I re-installed the game and I still can continue my progress.  <answer143007> Game Center only saves games achievements; it never saves game progress.
