How to update OS X using dmg <body> I have multiple Macs and I want to update all those macs using a dmg file. From where I can get the dmg file.brAnd how to update if the minor version difference is more than one. i.e. from 10.10.1 to 10.10.5?  <answer202378> You can get the dmg file from here: https://support.apple.com/downloads/macos  While downloading the dmg please check the system requirement. Because you will need a combo dmg file if you are upgrading from say code10.10.2/code to code10.10.5/code  On detail page of the dmg there is a codeSystem Requirements/code button at the bottom, please check the system requirement from there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cLkPb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment244110> The "combo update" disk images on [Apple's download page](https://support.apple.com/downloads/) will take care of updating from any minor version (e.g. 10.10.1, 10.10.2...) to the specified version (e.g. 10.10.5).
