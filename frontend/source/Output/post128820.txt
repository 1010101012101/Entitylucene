Is there an iOS app that measures/reports the battery charging current? <body> I suspect my fake lightening cable charge my iPhone 5 much slower than my original lightening cable on the same charger. Is there an app that will display the current battery draw/charging current and also plot it over time?  <answer128872> As I know, I don't think there is an app that can show the charger current. But there is a few app that can record your charging time and charging statistics. Try to search something like "battery doctor" or "battery" in AppStore. You can then compare the fake and the real one's charging time.  <answer138724> The battery doctor HD app by KS moblie tells me the charging current for my iPad 2.  However the battery doctor app for iPhone 4s does not appear to give this information.  <answer166472> Battery box or battery health. You could also contact Apple for a diagnostics test (they will text or email it to your iDevice)  <answer286794> download battery charging speedometer  <answer289127> there is a new app on the Apple store - Amperes. It shows the charging rate of your iPad/ iPhone.

BTW, http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134482/is-there-a-way-to-see-the-amp-levels-while-charging-my-iphone is a dupe of this question, with some good answers. <comment361974> Welcome to Ask Different!
