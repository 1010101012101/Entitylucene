Emails will not be deleted by Mail.app <body> All of us in the office use the same (remote) email server (via IMAP) but only some of us have this issue:  Emails are deleted in Mail.app and go to trash  After sometime the email reappears as unread email in the main mailbox  Colleague with this problem has an iPhone and Mac OSX laptop.  I don't have this issue and have an Android phone but also have OSX laptop.
