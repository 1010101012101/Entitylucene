Force external display refresh rate <body> I have a 27" screen which is connected to my mid-2012 MacBook Pro retina through a HDMI/DVI-D (HDMI on the MacBook Pro, DVI-D on the screen).  Before I was using a adapter DisplayPort+USB/DVI-D and I was able to get 60Hz refresh rate.  Now with the HDMI/DVI-D I have only 30Hz.  Is there any way to change (by forcing?) refresh rate to 60Hz?  Or is it a hardware limitation?  strongNOTE:/strong I can't change the Refresh Rate value from System Prefs, the menu is disabled and the value is set to 30Hz.  strongEDIT:/strong Here's the System Prefs window img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZkZT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer123183> You should be able to change the refresh rate in System preferences- Monitor.  This is an example of my HDMI to HDMI connection.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/25VON.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can try using the SwitchResX app to see if that will work.  FYI: Something is happening with Mavericks and external display (similar to yours) but I am not qualified to talk about what.  <answer210117> strongcscreen/strong  You can use the freely available Terminal app codecscreen/code to force display settings. The app is pretty self explanatory.  <answer218007> After much googling and trials, I have come to the conclusion that if your hardware (both computer/screen) doesn't support higher frequency, well, you can't force it.  As for my own case, it was the both not available (old MacBook Pro + Dell cheap 27" "fake 4K")  <answer232872> I came here searching for the answer myself because I've done it before but I installed an update and lost the settings.  csreen and switchresx can both set the resolution for you, but there's a limit in OSX that needs to be bypassed in order to accomplish this.  Additionally with the latest versions of OSX there's some sort of "system file protection" that prevents you from patching the relevant file.  First, you have to disable that file protection (which I think gets turned on after each update) and then you have to patch the relevant file in OSX.  If I find the answer for the latest version then I'll come back here and update the answer but you should google something to the effect to osx (your version) pixel clock unlock patch.  Once you patched the relevant files you should be able to use utilities like switchresx (which is what I use) to set custom resolutions.  I've found a patch for one version of osx here: https://github.com/Floris497/mac-pixel-clock-patch good luck!  <comment143813> Did you check System  Monitors or Displays already? <comment143818> Does it changing back to DisplayPort changes back to 60Hz? <comment143823> Robuust: yes, but the select menu is disabled (can't set anything else but 30Hz) Buscarì›ƒ: yes, it changes back to 60Hz. <comment143824> I can't change it from the System Prefs. The Refresh Rate menu is disabled. <comment143825> What does it say? does it show the correct monitor type in the above window? ie Sharp LCD? <comment143829> I edited the question (put a screenshot). <comment143832> Your system is not correctly identifying the Monitor with HDMI cable, it should name it by its name in Optimized for:. Also Try changing the resolution to 1920x1200. <comment143836> Then how can I fix that? I tried changing resolution, but still can't change value to anything else but 30Hz. <comment143837> Isn't there any .plist which I can modify to force 60Hz? <comment143839> It might be the cable (HDMI) or HDMI to DVI-D. How does it work with DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. Your monitor has 2 Input choices. <comment143840> I would not advice you in to Forcing anything, that might lead to more problems. <comment143842> Actually, I was using an adapter (DP+USB/DVI-D) which required Mini DisplayPort AND USB, and connected to the display with DVI-D. When I use that adapter, the only different with the HDMI/DVI-D is that I can change the refresh rate to 60Hz, everything else is exactly the same. As for forcing, the only thing which may stop me from forcing is that it may damage hardware. I don't care if it leads to software issues. <comment143843> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/13392/discussion-between-avetis-kazarian-and-buscar-) <comment253540> As I am on mobile I will add links etc later. <comment253746> Thanks! Unfortunately I don't have this screen anymore, but it's really helpful as I am a "do it with command line first" person :) <comment266563> FYI, if you use homebrew, cscreen can be installed with `brew cask install cscreen`. <comment275358> Just chiming in here, I tried this and didn't have any success on OSX 10.11. Bother monitors show refresh as 0, and when forcing configurations nothing seems to happen with the display. <comment275359> I actually believe this is a software issue. My monitor can be overclocked. My displayport interface has plenty of bandwidth for the higher refresh rates. The problem is Apple's restricted software drivers. Also, works fine in Windows. <comment317887> @avetis.kazarian What model is your Dell 27" and what makes you think it's "fake" 4K? <comment349493> I find it hard to believe my hardware can't drive this monitor at full resolution and 60 hz, since it has no problem doing so when it's rotated 90, 180, or 270 degrees - only when I have it in normal orientation does it drop down to 30 for some reason. <comment349741> @childofsoong: thanks for the information, this might be helpful resolving this issue.
