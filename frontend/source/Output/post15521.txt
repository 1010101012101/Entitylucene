Since yesterday I can't login to iOS developer forum. What's going on? <body> Since yesterday I can't login to the iOS developer forums, and I just subscribed 3 weeks ago. This is the error I get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/buTPy.png" alt="Dev Forums error"  What's going on?  <answer15537> Maybe the site was swamped, everyone trying to access at once, because of the announcements yesterday?  <answer15539> Your ID needs someone to look into it. Reach out at http://developer.apple.com/contact and perhaps read through the steps here.
