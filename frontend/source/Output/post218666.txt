Blocked iCloud email account <body> Until 2 December by home security camera sent email alerts to my iCloud mail accounts from another home email account which I also use on my Mac. Since then emails have been returned undelivered, apparently blocked by Apple.  Test messages from my Mac to my iCloud account are similarly returned, though traffic is still being received in the iCloud account from other sources.  The CCTV alerts are not being sent to the junk folder.  How can I find out what is going on?  Below is the returned mail message I typically receive, Proofpoint tells me that the sovision SMTP mail server address, 109.228.41.85, is not blacklisted.  precode********* This is the Postfix program at host sv0.sovision.net.

If iCloud is using this blacklist to filter out potential spam then your email will be blocked.  Sometimes the bounced email will give a clue as to the reason for rejection and which blacklist was used (if any).  You can check if your mailserver's IP address is listed on many of the main blacklists with various tools:  ul li"Blacklist Check" on MX Toolbox/li liTrend Micro - Email Reputation Services/li /ul  <comment264781> "Proofpoint tells me ... not blacklisted" - It's quite possible that the block has since been cleared (if you are only just running this test)? - the email quoted above is from 6 days ago. Incidentally, MX Toolbox (that I mentioned in my answer) still reports that IP address listed on two blacklists: "MAILSPIKE BL" and "SORBS SPAM" - although this might not be significant.
