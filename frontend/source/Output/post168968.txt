Why isn't iCloud drive icon visible in finder <body> This is more of an aesthetic question rather than a functional one, but after upgrading to OSX Yosemite I don't have the iCloud drive or history icon in finder, it just gives me the default.  In finder preferences, the icons appear normally...Any ideas why?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MsweK.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B77Aa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment198391> and it is not in the Finder preferences? <comment198396> In finder preferences the icons are there: <comment198403> and if you enable it (check mark) it still does not show in Finder side bar? <comment198405> reset your finder using alt+cmd+esc then in the pop uo reset (relaunch) the finder. <comment198574> Thank you for trying to help.  Correct, as shown, with iCloud Drive and Downloads enabled, it still doesn't show in the finder.  Reseting/relaunching the finder does not have any effect... <comment200270> I guess reinstalling Yosemite is the only solution... <comment200277> sounds like it :)
