iPhone 5 cannot receive or make calls <body> My iPhone 5 has a problem: I cannot receive an incoming or make an outgoing call, but it is fine for Messenger and WhatsApp calls. My phone will vibrate when it has an incoming call, but when I hold for answer, my iPhone just vibrates and I do not hear anything. When I make a call, my phone becomes laggy and shows call ended or just clears like that.  I have tried many ways to fix this problem. Dial *#31#, reset my iPhone, caller id, cellular data, and I don't know what the problem is. Someone help me please?
