Same machine registered multiple times with iCloud and iMessage, need to remove extras <body> I have and iMac and a MacBook Air. Somehow, they are registered multiple times in iCloud and I can't find the way to remove them. Apple support says they can't do it on their end! This came up during a call to them to figure out why iMessage doesn't work on either of them. While Facetime has the correct number of computer registrations, iMessage has all these profiles hanging about and gets confused by extras. The https://www.icloud.com/#find site lists my iPhone and iMac once. Are there any other places I can manage my device registrations? Any possible steps I can take? I'm looking for ideas. I want to be able to use iMessage on my Macs and the only way to fix iMessage is to get rid of these extra profiles. I can prove that I have extra profiles. Here's the prompt when removing a google account from iCloud:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLcGg.png" alt="enter image description here"  The tech at Apple gave me exactly the same list of devices. My BigMac is registered twice, my MBA three times. But he can't remove them on his end.  Help!
