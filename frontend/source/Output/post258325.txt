macOS new logging api (unified logging) log stream <body> Questions:  strong1)/strong How can we redirect the codelog/code emstream/em from stdin to, for example codelnav/code? Currently, I use bash | (pipe), but I would like to hear if there is a better way to do it - the pipe buffer flow is too fast for codelnav/code to process and format it properly –  any ideas/solutons here?  I don't know how to set a embridge/em (I don't want to write/read to the filesystem) between log and any other shell process without pipe in bash directly.  strong2)/strong How can I properly use the stream from codelog stream/code to put the JSON direct into codemongodb/code?   codelog stream --style=json/code output  makes it a lot easier to hack some awesome node analytical/statistical or visual parsers.  codelog stream --style=syslog --level=info/code can make one dizzy, with  strong--predicate/strong you can narrow it down to more readable flow:   codelog stream --style syslog  --predicate \ 'senderImagePath contains[cd] "TimeMachine"' --info/code  The API is a good step forward – but I'd like to have more transition time with codesyslog/code until I forget about it and the uhmmmm the new memory empersistent/em log since code10.12.1 public beta/code is not entirely to my liking since I simply don't get any new log files in code/private/var/log/code (can also be my config error/mistake though)  emupdate 1/em – https://developer.apple.com/reference/os/1891852-logging#1682426
