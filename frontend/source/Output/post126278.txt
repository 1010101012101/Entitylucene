a and c keys not working on macbook, even on an external keyboard <body> It's a 2011 MacBook pro and the kbda/kbd and kbdc/kbd keys are not working on both the built-in keyboard and the usb keyboard.   Because of this i can't bypass the firmware login screen.  Now the weird thing is that that kbdcmd/kbd + kbda/kbd works (select all) so the key is being recognized, but kbda/kbd by itself doesn't.   Any ideas?   <answer126286> You can start by rebooting into safe mode as a troubleshooting step. Restart and hold down the shift key, when booted into safe mode you can test the keys:  Delete the preference file which can be found here  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist  Restart normally  <comment147881> is it only the a and c keys? <comment147884> As far as i can tell <comment147890> How about option a and option c?  (รฅ and รง on US layout) <comment147898> Cant boot into safemode because of firmware password. Firmware password appears instantly upon boot <comment147907> That does nothing <comment147998> Does your computer have a removable RAM? If so then you can take out one RAM stick and boot the computer by holding down CMD+ALT+P+R and allow the computer to reboot 3 times which should clear the firmware password. <comment148228> I tried but it turns out that only works on pre 2010 macs.
