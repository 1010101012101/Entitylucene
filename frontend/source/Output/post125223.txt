Why don't I see scroll bars when using a mouse? <body> I have a Late 2008 MacBook Pro running Mavericks. In System Preferences  General, I have "Show scroll bars: Automatically based on mouse or trackpad". It used to work as expected: with a mouse plugged in, scroll bars were visible, and when unplugged, and only using the built-in trackpad, scroll bars were only visible when scrolling. But now, scroll bars only appear when scrolling, as if the mouse is not plugged in. Other than this, the mouse works fine. I can get persistent scroll bars by selecting "Show scroll bars: Always", but why doesn't it work automatically?  I don't believe this is a hardware issue. If I log into a guest account, it works as expected: unplugging the mouse makes the scroll bars automatically disappear; plugging it in makes them reappear.  <comment146565> Sounds like you should restore your user preferences.
