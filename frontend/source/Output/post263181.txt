How to stop photos taken in Notes being saved in Photo library? <body> I mostly work with Notes app in iOS and every time when I capture an image from Note app specific camera, it saves in Photo library. So after making a note I have to delete few images every time to clean my library. So is there any way of stopping that?   <answer263182> Yes. That is possible in iOS 10 or later version ( I think). However to do that simply you have to turn off a specific option provided in Notes settings.   strongMethod/strong  Goto Settings - Notes  Then turn off Save Media to Photos. That will solve your problem.   <comment329729> I cannot find settings in notes app? <comment329730> Not in Notes app. Just goto Settings in iOS. <comment329731> Ah thanks. Finally that problem solved.
