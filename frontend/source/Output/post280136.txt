Bash Tab-Completion for OSX Specific commands <body> I've been looking around and I can't seem to find a bash completion rule set for macOS specific utilities. (i.e. diskutil, kext(*whatever), networksetup, defaults, launchctl, etc.) comparable to tab-completion for git commands.  Specifically, I would like to have codeTAB/code print a list of the options for the tool.  Does that exist?  <answer280137> If you use a package manager (Homebrew, MacPorts, etc) it's worth checking if it provides any - codebrew search completion/code returns codelaunchctl-completion/code, for example, though the other tools you mention aren't listed. You don't mention codetmutil/code, but if it's useful there's a completion for it here:  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash  ### 補完関数。 _tmutil(){   list=$( tmutil | /usr/bin/grep -v ^$ | /usr/bin/grep ^Usage | awk '{print $3}' )   COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "$list" ${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}  ) )  } complete -F _tmutil tmutil /code/pre  That might also be a good basis for hacking your own completions?  <comment352347> This is awesome. Now if only the different OS X commands' option flags abided a standard format, or had help files as easy to parse as tmutil..
