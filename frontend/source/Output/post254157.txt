Sierra on mid 2010 Macbook Pro <body> A couple of problems with the above combination.   When I boot up the computer it automatically connects to my network drive (WD MyBookLive) but I get 1, 2 or 3 icons for the same drive on my desktop. I don’t have the drive in my startup items so I don’t know if this is a feature of Sierra.  My other problem is when I try to wake the computer from sleep it shuts down. The light glows when it’s sleeping, but as soon as I touch the spacebar to wake it just shuts down and I have to press the power button.  <comment316380> Welcome to Ask Different.  You need to clarify your 'question' to add an actual question.  Also, this type of Q&A format works best if you stick to only 1 topic/question at a time. - From Review
