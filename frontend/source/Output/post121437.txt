How many displays on MacBook Pro 2011 <body> How many displays can I connect on my MacBook Pro early 2011? Now I use extender monitor, but the screen of MacBook is off, like this macbook http://shrani.si/f/V/wG/3dRsX6iy/screen-shot-2014-02-18-a.png brand I forced my graphic card to non automatic switch monitor http://shrani.si/f/35/qq/4Oq2JVmK/screen-shot-2014-02-18-a.png br My question is next: br Can I use 2 LG TV displays? or I must buy MBP retina? br  Greetings Andrej  <answer121444> Yes, you can, since your computer has a Thunderbolt port (http://support.apple.com/kb/sp620). According to Apple, you can daisy-chain additional monitors using the Thunderbolt port:     To make a desktop workstation out of your MacBook Pro, just daisy-chain additional Thunderbolt devices, including high-performance storage and video and audio capture devices, through the display.
