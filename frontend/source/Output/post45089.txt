'Find My Mac' says that it is already in use, how to fully remove previous configuration? <body> I posted a question earlier about using Find My Mac while my computer was sleeping, and after doing some research I noticed that I had 'Wake for network access' already enabled. So when I went to check iCloud again, I noticed it saying this (Find My Mac already in use):   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hjpGi.png" alt="Find My Mac already in use"  If I check the box, I then get this alert message:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X6ns4.png" alt="Will Disable for other user"  The only thing I can think of, is that I may have signed in with another iCloud account on this computer (I have an old iTunes account, plus a mobile me converted account that I actually use).   bmike mentioned he had see registration issues with Lion updates, and not sure if this was related to something similar, or to possibly linking this computer with another iCloud account originally. I want that original one gone, and only my new one to go.   My question is: strongIs there any where else I should look for remnants of this 'other' iCloud account, to not cause other issues?/strong I know this was working at some point, even recently, so it confuses me on what happened here.   strongUpdate:/strong So I went ahead and checked this, clicked Continue below, and it appears to work fine. I would still like to find what ID or anything else that would cause this though to help understand it if it happens again.  <answer45108> I had this happen to me a couple of months ago.  I was perplexed, as you were, about what could be causing it.  I figured out the following, but as there's no information for this online it could be incorrect:  ol liFind My Mac is tied to the serial number of your Mac/li liFind My Mac was partially enabled before iCloud was released/li liSince it was partially enabled, a previous MobileMe account could cause conflicts./li /ol  Again, I have no definitive proof for this.  But I got this notice on a fresh install of the operating system, emonly/em after upgrading my MobileMe account to an iCloud account.  So if I were you I wouldn't worry about it.  Most likely it's just a MobileMe bug that never got quite resolved.  <comment51294> Do you still have any other user accounts on this machine? What happens if you sign out of iCloud and back in? More importantly, what happens if you click "Continue"? <comment51295> No other user accounts. Have not signed out. Clicking continue prompts me for location info. I haven't gotten farther than that, hoping to get some feedback from this question first. As in, I am sure if I click though, things will 'just work', but I would like to remove whatever cruft I can as well <comment51296> You might use `opensnoop` to figure out where it's reading data from â€” but my guess is that once you go through the setup process, you're not likely to see the problem again. <comment51301> Ive actually used something similar like fsusage <comment51307> And what was the result? <comment51311> Way to much data flying by to get something easily. <comment51500> This worked, and seeing that someone at least as seen the problem and doesn't seem to have any issues with it after the fact, will mark this as resolved. I do have beta/dev access, so it may have been something related to that.
