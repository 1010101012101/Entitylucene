Access application submenus with AppleScript <body> I am trying to learn to access any menu item within an application with AppleScript. I can orient to the actual menu tab, and then access clickable menu items, but I can't access menu items within submenues that appear if they are hoovered over or RightArrow is pressed.  In the code below, "emZoom/em" is this type of menu item, and can't be found using the term 'menu item'. What term should I use instead so I can access "emZoom in/em"?   precode1 tell application "Firefox" 2   activate 3   tell application "System Events" 4       tell process "Firefox" 5           click menu item "Zoom in" of menu item "Zoom" of menu "Tools" of menu bar 1 6       end tell 7   end tell 8 end tell /code/pre  Note: "emZoom in/em" has, by chance, a shortcut "CMD" and "+", but this is not a solution.  emAdditional question: How do I pick "the first", "the last" or the "n:th" menu item?/em  <answer134943> This one is a bit tricky since you have to select the menu for example :   precodetell application "Firefox"     activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Firefox"             click menu item 1 of menu 1 of menu item 1 of menu 1 of menu bar item "Tools" of menu bar 1          end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  This piece of code will call the first item (the first in the submenu) of the first item of the emTools/em menu.    If you want to call the first or the last item just use the keyword last or first  :   precodefirst menu bar item of menu bar 1 last menu bar item of menu bar 1 /code/pre  NB : You can replace the index of the item by its label.   <answer202503> There are a couple of things.  First you will need a delay between the Activation of the App (Firefox) and the click action.  If you do not,the click action will be fire way too soon for the application to pick it up.  Secondly, in my FirfFox the strongZoom in/strong Menu item is under the strongView/strong menu.  So the code needs to work back from the Zoom in menu item back to the initial Menu item taking in all the nodes in between.  codeclick menu item "Zoom In" of menu 1 of menu item "Zoom" of menu 1 of menu bar item "View" of menu bar/code 1  precodeactivate application "Firefox" delay 1 tell application "System Events"     tell process "Firefox"         click menu item "Zoom In" of menu 1 of menu item "Zoom" of menu 1 of menu bar item "View" of menu bar 1      end tell end tell /code/pre  Each Sub strongmenu item/strong must have a controlling strongmenu/strong  So you could even use.  precodeclick menu item "Zoom In" of it's menu of menu item "Zoom" of it's menu of menu bar item "View" of menu bar 1 /code/pre  <comment159900> Thanks! I was a bit confused by the long "of menu" line since it didn't have any actual menu item names, but when I broke it down I understood it. Thanks again!
