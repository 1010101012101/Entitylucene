OSX equivalent for reset <body> On linux machines I used to type codereset/code on terminal.  It was like, closing and reopening the terminal! It is very convenient, because in debugging you wont mix error messages from previous executions.  The command does exists on OSX, however when i scroll up, the previous output is there too!  <answer102579> As you mentioned, codereset/code does work in OS X, however you can combine it with kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd + kbdK/kbd to 'Clear Scrollback'. This clears Terminal's history scrollback.  Alternatively, you can just use kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdK/kbd to 'Clear All'. This works similarly to how you use codereset/code in Linux.  <answer102581> In OSX's Terminal.app, you can hit kbdcommand/kbd + kbdK/kbd  This will clear your terminal session completely.  Also see this  Use the right tool for each job:  Use codeclear/code to clear the terminal window.  Use codereset/code to reset your terminal when it gets messed up by control sequences.  Use codecat/code only when you want to stream a whole lot of data from one place to another uninterrupted.  <comment120781> I have `/usr/bin/reset` in Lion.
