"@" symbol in password in applescript <body> I am using an applescript to mount a users home folder. However, when I use a password with a "@" symbol the script fails since the "@" symbol is also the separator between the password and servername? Anyway around this outside of changing the password?  Thanks  Here is the script:  precodedisplay dialog "Please enter your username" default answer "" set the user_name to the text returned of the result  display dialog "Please enter your password" default answer "" with hidden answer set pass_word to the text returned of the result  set server_name to "servername" set share_name to "sharename" mount volume "smb://" &amp; user_name &amp; ":" &amp; pass_word &amp; "@" &amp; server_name &amp; "/" &amp; share_name &amp; "/" &amp; user_name /code/pre  <answer89393> Rather than using the in-line form to give the username and password, you can specify them as parameters for the codemount volume/code command. Changing the final line to the following will work with passwords with special characters:  precodemount volume "smb://" &amp; server_name &amp; "/" &amp; share_name &amp; "/" &amp; user_name as user name user_name with password pass_word /code/pre  <comment104911> instead of @ use % for it <comment105203> Note that on most Unices, you don't want to put passwords in command lines because they can then be viewed with `ps` and the like.
