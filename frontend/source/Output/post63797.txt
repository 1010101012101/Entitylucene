Why does my iPad 2 beep sometimes? <body> My iPad with iOS 5.1.1 (with home screen is activated) plays a "beep beep" sound (as if I had gotten a new e-mail) every 10 minutes or so, but no notification is shown. Can I find out what causes the beeps?  <comment73809> Is it the sound you've assigned for new mail notifications? If so, my psychic powers tell me you've got a Gmail account set up, and it moves the email into a folder according to some rule you've set up, bypassing the Inbox. <comment73853> Good guess, I have a Gmail account which forwards e-mail to my Hotmail account, but only the latter is set up in my iPad, and I didn't get e-mails when my iPad was beeping this afternoon. It suddenly stopped beeping, too. I think there must be another explanation. I have already checked all my notification settings, and no sounds are enabled for every app. I really wonder why it just beeps sometimes. <comment78437> You may try to activate all Notifications for your apps to be shown in the Notification area...
