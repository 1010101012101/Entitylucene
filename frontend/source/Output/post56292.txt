Change label on USB drive in OSX Terminal <body> I am trying to write a program in Python that will rename a USB drive (from the standard "USB DISK" to my custom "MYDISK").  However, I can't find any way to do this neither in Python nor in OSX Terminal. (I figured, if I can make it work in Terminal, I can simply use os.system("command") in Python).  The USB drive is a FAT32 formatted flash drive on filesystem /dev/disk2s1, and it is by default mounted on /Volumes/USB DISK  What I have tried so far: (from http://techbu.com/2009/06/28/renaming-usb-drive-labels-in-linux)  precodesudo umount /Volumes/USB\ DISK            ## Works fine sudo mlabel -i /dev/disk2s1 ::MYDISK      ## Command not found! /code/pre  It seems that the "mlabel" command is not found in OSX Terminal. Is there an alternative?  <answer56293> See diskutil  precodesudo diskutil rename USB\ DISK MYDISK  /code/pre  <answer56294> Install homebrew and then:  precode$ brew install mtools /code/pre  This gives you codemlabel/code and various other GNU utilities for working with MS-DOS.  <answer200383> install it and every thing  done :D https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mtools-Installation-on-Ubuntu-12.04  <comment64590> http://superuser.com/questions/315220/how-to-rename-a-partition-in-os-x <comment64591> Great! I figured I shouldn't unmount it first. Thanks! <comment241459> How does this help on OSX?
