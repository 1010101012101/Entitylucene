Disable non-breaking space (Option-Space) specifically in Xcode <body> There's a pretty general solution for disabling the non-breaking space in OS X for some apps:  https://superuser.com/questions/78245/how-to-disable-the-option-space-key-combination-for-non-breaking-spaces  Unfortunately, Xcode is not one of them, and the solution does not work.  Any ideas on how to disable Option-Space for Xcode specifically?  I'm using a slightly customized keyboard layout, created with Ukulele; perhaps it could be used to remap that particular combination?  I'd rather not use stuff like KeyRemap4Macbook (or whatever it's called), since I've experienced a considerable, unacceptable lag during typing when using that app with some remaps.  <answer179653> I have found a somehow dirty workaround to disable the key combination for Xcode only:  To disable kbdalt/opt/kbdkbdspace/kbd add a new keybinding in the file  IDETextKeyBindingSet.plist in the folder /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Frameworks/IDEKit.framework/Resources.  Open the plist and add a new dictionary called 'Customized'. Create a new child named 'Insert No Alt-Space' with type 'String' and the value 'InsertSpace:'. Save the file.  Open Xcode - Preferences - Key Bindings - Customizedbr Highlight 'Insert No Alt-Space' - Key and enter kbdalt/opt/kbdkbdspace/kbd.  In the future you will get an audible error message typing the combination but nothing will be written.  Until now i haven't found a method to just insert a space instead of a non-breaking space.  Probably you have to redo the modification with every new Xcode version.  <comment213833> Thanks for your answer. While this is indeed a solution that would require re-applying the patch on each update, so far it's the only one that works. The bounty is yours. <comment338218> not working with Xcode 8 any more, btw
