Is there way to invert X and Y direction on 2010 MBP built-in trackpad (not scroll)? <body> First and foremost, this is not asking about scroll direction.  :)  I have a 2010 MacBookPro7,1 w/ macOS Sierra that has the trackpad physically upside-down, so from my perspective, moving my finger down moves the cursor up, and moving my finger left movies it right, etc.  There is obviously no System Prefs option for inverting it.  I found a tool called BetterTouchTool that can do this for the USB Apple Magic Trackpad, but this is the one built-in.  Does anyone know of a way to accomplish this (and only for the trackpad)?    (Side note: The reason this is even possible is that this particular Mac is actually the motherboard/trackpad/SSD from a horribly busted MBP rebuilt into a slapdash case made out of Lego pieces.  The trackpad is resting on top of my Lego structure, and would only fit backward due to the short ribbon cable.)  <comment349308> Given your current situation...is it necessary to even have the trackpad connected?  Why not just hook up a $5 corded mouse and disconnect the trackpad altogether? <comment349311> I found in testing the components that the motherboard doesn't "like" running without the trackpad connected.  Without it, the CPU fan runs at 100% all the time and the kernel_task process eats up 99% of the CPU.  I believe it's due to the missing palmrest temp sensor which is in the trackpad.  I already decided that if I can't invert the pad that I will just build legos over it and close it off entirely so it isn't visible.
