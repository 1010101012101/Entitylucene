STARTTLS handshake against Apple smtp server fails <body> Recently, my email setup using Emacs/24.4 + Gnus/5.13 on OX Yosemite stopped working against the Apple smtp server: codesmtp.mail.me.com/code.  It has been working fine for years before.  It seems that it times out during the STARTTLS handshake as you can see below.  precode$ gnutls-cli --verbose --starttls --tofu -p 587 smtp.mail.me.com Processed 257 CA certificate(s). Resolving 'smtp.mail.me.com'... Connecting to '17.172.34.225:587'...  - Simple Client Mode:  - Received[137]: 220 st11p00mm-asmtp003.mac.com -- Server ESMTP (Oracle Communications Messaging Server 7u4-27.10(7.0.4.27.9) 64bit (built Jun  6 2014)) 2 STARTTLS - Sent: 11 bytes *** Starting TLS handshake *** Fatal error: The operation timed out *** Handshake has failed /code/pre  Does somebody know how to further debug the issue and fix it?  <comment183569> Does the command `(echo EHLO foo ; sleep 3) | nc smtp.mail.me.com 587` return anything? I'm not able to get a dump of the characteristics of either smtp.mail.me.com or mx[1-6].mail.icloud.com. so I'm not sure what filtering Apple is running. I do get STARTLES to spool.mail.gandi.net so the filtering isn't on my side or ISP side. <comment183648> @bmike I'm afraid I'm getting the server signature only. `$ (echo EHLO foo ; sleep 3) | nc smtp.mail.me.com 587 220 st11p00mm-asmtp001.mac.com -- Server ESMTP (Oracle Communications Messaging Server 7u4-27.10(7.0.4.27.9) 64bit (built Jun  6 2014))` <comment185015> Recent OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 update seem to have solved the problem.
