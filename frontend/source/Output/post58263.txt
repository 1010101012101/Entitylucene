How can I port apps from OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion to OS X 10.7 Lion? <body> In Mountain Lion, many of the day-to-day apps like Preview, TextEdit have been upgraded with some very useful features. (For instance, you can now insert a page into a PDF document using your scanner in Preview - see here, and pinch the trackpad for zooming in on to a document - see here). However, as far as I understand, these apps are free, and features like these are features of the app themselves, not the OS.  Is there anyway in which I can replace/upgrade individual apps in Lion, without having to install it as a whole (preferably as a dual-boot config!) ?  <answer58275> No.  Apple does not distribute these apps individually.br Even if you copy them from one Mountain Lion system to a Lion machine, they are very likely to emnot/em work as they are relying on system level framework (or functions in these frameworks) that won't be available in OS X before ML  <comment79006> "These apps" - Preview, for example - aren't really free. They are shipped with Mac OS X. I think it's reasonable to consider them a fairly integral part of the OS, which you are both paying for, and are tied to that version.
