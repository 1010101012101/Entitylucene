How do I reset the Display cached data? <body> A week ago I noticed a weird Lion symptom, and posted a vague description of one this problem.  Today, after some tests, I came to a conclusion that this bug reproduces whenever a the computer is logged into while plugged to a certain display, and then being plugged to a different display.  The only thing I can think of is that the display data is saved, and a conflict occurs upon the plugging of a different display.  Any idea as to how I can delete or reset this data?  <answer29961> I am unable to reproduce the problem.  Maybe this will work: emSystem Preferences  Displays  Detect Displays/em  <comment34391> I did. I'm experiencing this problem with an Apple Cinema Display and some old LG display. Probably type specific. <comment34413> hmmm, I have a few questions. What mac are you using (pro, macbook, imac)? How are you connecting the displays (DVI, VGA, HDMI [any adaptors])? Is it still just the application switcher that has the graphical issues, or are there other problems as well? <comment36417> I have the same problem. <comment37928> I've found that logging out from the current user and logging back in again resets the Application Switcher. So far, sad to say, this is the only "solution" to the problem.
