Password protected drive gives error when moving from a time machine partition <body> Goal: Move from time machine partition  Problem: Password protection gives an error.   Partitioned my wd elements 500 gb into two equal sized backups, elements1 and elements2. I perform time machine backups on elements2 often. Elements2 is password protected, elements1 is not.   My computer runs 10.9 and I bought a new one running 10.10. Wanted to transfer from elements2 to new computer (to be precise, everything except the music folder since it is too big). But when I restart the new computer using cmd+R and pick my elements1, it asks for a password, I give it, but then nothing. It freezes. What should I do?
