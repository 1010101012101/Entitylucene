How to map CAPS LOCK key in Vim? <body> This question has already been asked here. The accepted answer says it is not possible. Other answers provide a way to do it on linux but I have not check if it worked. I am most interested in knowing if there is a way to do it for mac (although you can post answers for linux as well).   I am only reposting this question here because the other question on SOF is more than five years old. Ideally, I would like to remap to code&lt;ESC&gt;/code key to codeCAPS LOCK/code.  <answer215070> If you are using the codeX11/code environment, you may achieve what you want with the following commands:  precodexmodmap -e 'clear lock' /code/pre  which means: from now on, Caps_Lock key isn't anymore a keyboard modifier and fall back to a normal key  precodexmodmap -e 'keysym Caps_Lock = Escape' /code/pre  which means: get the keycode of codeCaps_Lock/code and from now on assign it the keysym of codeEscape/code.  strongNote/strong: this receipe works on any Unix.  <answer215084> The question you posted is still up to date. I've been using the AutoHotkey solution under windows for some years and I'm quite happy with it. I find it useful to also remap the Capslock to Esc under Firefox+Pentadactyl.  As there is no AutoHotkey for mac, you should look for its alternatives.  <answer216287> Steve Losh describes a Mac specific way in his blog on the crafting a modern Space Cadet.  He also calls out these instructions in his tutorial on Vim.  <comment259795> Is the terminal application not the same as `X11`? I tried putting those commands in my `.vimrc` but it does not recognize it <comment259825> I don't know if it works the same on mac but on linux, if you want those commands to be executed automatically by xmodmap, you shouldn't put them in `.vimrc` but in `~/.Xmodmap`. Besides, you don't write the whole command anymore, just what's inside the quotes. For example, instead of putting `xmodmap -e 'clear lock'` in `.Xmodmap`, you just write `clear lock`. Then you restart the computer or you just log out and log in back so that xmodmap reads the file and executes each line it contains. <comment259920> @solalito: the commands I gave here aren't internal `vi` commands, but `X11` environment ones. They won't work within `vi` or `Terminal`, because they directly talk to the `X`` server and more precisely to the part which deal with the keyboard managment. <comment259923> @solalito: I didn't test it, but from a critical reading of their web server, `Karabiner`: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ seems to be a correct solution to your problem. If you test it successfully, I suggest you to make here an answer to your question.
