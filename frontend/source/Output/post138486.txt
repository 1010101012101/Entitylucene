The time using 'Set date and time automatically' differs between OS X and iOS <body> On my OS X Mavericks my time is always a few minutes (about 4 minutes) ahead of my iOS 7.1.2 iPhone. Both devices are set to set the date and time automatically.  On my Mac I can choose from:  ul liApple Americas/U.S. (time.apple.com.)/li liApple Asia (time.asia.apple.com.)/li liApple Europe (time.euro.apple.com.)/li /ul  but these do not differ more than a second or so.  On my iPhone I can only choose 'Set Automatically'.  strongWhy is there a difference between both times? And which one is 'real'?/strong  Screenshot taken with a few seconds in between (believe me ;) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1xGE.png" alt="osx time settings" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8x2zgl.png" alt="iphone time settings"  <answer138511> It's possible your codentp.drift/code file is something insane - check code/var/db/ntp.drift/code, delete it if necessary, and restart (kill) codentpd/code.  <answer138513> The iPhone does not use NTP to synchronize its clock. It uses a feature of the cellular network. I can't tell you why your Mac's clock is off that far, but I suggest you use codenl.pool.ntp.org/code instead of codetime.euro.apple.com/code.  <comment163390> Does my iPhone use a non-apple time server? <comment163391> Can I resize my iPhone screenshot using this forums engine? (might be a valid discussion..) <comment163403> As regards which one is real, I like the website at http://time.gov - I can work out timezone differences myself from that easily enough <comment163416> @MarkSetchell, well the iPhone is right according to your clock. (btw, that site sucks horribly in obeying WWW etiquette) <comment163446> I have no `/var/db/ntp.drift` on my OS X Mavericks. Strange, because I do have a /usr/sbin/ntpd -c /private/etc/ntp-restrict.conf -n -g -p /var/run/ntpd.pid -f /var/db/ntp.drift process running... And rebooting does not solve my issue, so I think killing ntpd doesn't either. <comment163447> Funny, using nl.pool.ntp.org will not change my time at all. This might be because my 'correction factor' is wrong. I have had issues with this because of Parallels... <comment163448> Is it possible that Parallels is responsible for this? <comment165560> Similar, but this worked: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/119485/55028
