Have you looked into a program like PhoneView that will let you mount iOS device as an external drive and use Disk Utility (if you have a Mac) or codefsck/code? The FAQ for PhoneView has a windows software recommendation that does about the same things if you prefer that OS on the desktop.  (edit: I don't know of any free alternatives that mount the file system)   <comment18568> Can I know any open source or freeware alternative?? [PhoneView](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/faq.html) and [TouchCopy](http://www.wideanglesoftware.com/touchcopy/index.php) are both payware. <comment22732> Please post what you did to fix it as an answer. Thanks. <comment23710> @Nathan Greenstein see my udpate 2 <comment168691> Isn't this an obvious case of booting in DFU (Home + power, wait for reboot, wait 4 seconds, release power en hold home), and restoring via iTunes?
