Disabled iPhone 6- possible data recovery? <body> My sister's iPhone was physically damaged (broken screen) and replaced. At some point prior to breakage (at least a few months from what I can tell) the phone stopped syncing to iCloud due to the iCloud storage being full. The damaged phone is now disabled from trying to get at the data still on the phone after she forgot the password (she normally used the print recognition which stopped working after several damages/ battery fully discharged). The replacement phone does sync properly to iCloud and does back up, however the data from the broken phone seems to be completely gone from the iCloud (most likely from when it stopped backing up because it was full).  I have tried multiple data recovery programs, all of which require the device and computer to be "trusted" to sync, however the trust option does not appear due to the device being disabled.  The main data points that are of utmost recovery importance are 3 voice memos from our deceased mother and one thing saved in notes.  A forensic data recovery firm gave us an estimate of $400+ to recover the data. Before we spend this type of money for a result that may not even yield the data, we are trying everything to try to recover the data ourselves.  I have attempted to use: *Enigma Recovery *EaseUS MobiSaver *PhoneRescue *AnyTrans *dr.Fone Toolkit *DataRecovery for iPhone *iPhone Backup Extractor *Gihosoft Free *iSkySoft *FoneLab *reiBoot *UltData *Jihosoft iPhone Data Recovery  The phone will not sync to iTunes and gives an error requiring entry of passcode (not possible due to iPhone is disabled). iTunes did let me upgrade to the latest iOS but this did not affect the accessibility of the phone or data.  There are no known backups in iTunes, iCloud, or any PC. Apple has told us that they cannot do anything besides "wipe" the phone, also removing all data. I can see the phone as an external drive when hooked into my PC, but cannot see any files, just the file/ empty disk usage.  Any suggestions?  <comment372714> Possible duplicate of [Unlocking a disabled iPhone](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/294611/unlocking-a-disabled-iphone)
