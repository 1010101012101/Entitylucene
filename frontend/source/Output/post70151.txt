Cannot add keyboard shortcuts in Mountain Lion <body> As of an unknown moment, I cannot add custom keyboard shortcuts anymore. Isn't there supposed to be an add button somewhere here? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YdpY7.jpg" alt="no add button"  <answer70152> The emadd/em button appears if you select the emApplications/em item from the list on the left.   For the rest of the given items, you can't add new shortcuts this way, but change the default ones. To do so, you must, first strongcheck/strong the shortcut, enabling it, then you'll be able to strongdouble-click/strong the shortcut and, holding down the new keys, change it to a new one.  <answer70170> On the screenshot the panel with more choices is completely withdrawn (on the left). Once you pull it out, it makes it possible to select "Application Shortcuts" and then a "+" button appears which provides the sought functionality.  Bottom line: don't lose your panels!  <comment81469> But by adding I don't mean editing an existing one. The screen shot actually shows the actual complete list of shortcuts I happen to have at the momentâ€¦ isn't it too short? What about adding a custom one for an arbitrary application? I remember this was possible before. <comment81470> @nomadcoder The *add* button appears if you select *Applications* . <comment81471> Ok, I got it. As you see on the screenshot, I have the left list hidden - and totally forgot about it. Stupid me. Thanks! <comment81474> I'll update my answer, pointing out the difference between the selected items on the list. <comment81475> The key moment here was to unhide the left panel (see screenshot).
