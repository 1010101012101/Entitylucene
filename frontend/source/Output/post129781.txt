Personal domain email using Outlook.com on Apple Mail <body> I use Outlook.com as my email provider but have my own personal domain name instead of the one provided by Microsoft. So, instead of "strongmail@outlook.com/strong", my email address looks like "strongmail@personaldomain.com/strong".  I have been trying to somehow configure this email on my Apple Mail client but so far been unsuccessful. I have read several how-to's and tutorials that explain how to configure an outlook.com email on Apple Mail; however, none have explained what to do when you have a private domain running on Outlook.com. Could someone with a similar experience please help me out?  Also, though I will be more than happy to just have my email configured, it would be really great if IMAP were a possibility instead of POP3.  <answer129794> To set up your Mac Mail to sync your Outlook.com account’s email:  ol liOpen Mac Mail./li liFrom the File menu, choose Add Account…/li liInput your account information. /li liChoose Account Type: IMAP./li liInput the following as the Incoming Mail Server:  imap-mail.outlook.com.

Outgoing mail server: smtp-mail.outlook.com <comment151903> That should work, if you use the correct ports <comment151913> Thank you, this seems to be working. Except that now it's downloading my entire inbox! That's like thousands of read emails! Isn't there any way to tell Apple Mail to only download new/unread emails? <comment336182> That is how IMAP works. If you want to download only new email, you may tray replacing the IMAP server with POP3, and the appropriate port / server information.
