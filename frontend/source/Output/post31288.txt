Is it possible to attach a file to an email from the command line? <body> I am often using the terminal, and I'd like to be able type a command that will attach a selected file to an email in mail.app.  precode:~ mailme myfile /code/pre  Any idea on how to do that?  <answer31299> The command  precodeopen -a Mail.app [filename(s)] /code/pre  opens a "New Message" window in Mail.app, with the codefilename(s)/code attached.  <answer31305> Works also with Thunderbird  precodeopen -a Thunderbird filename /code/pre  It seems that yout can attach only one file to a new e-mail.  <comment35896> excellent, thanks, I'll make myself an alias <comment81809> Could you give an example for `open -a Thunderbird [filename(s)]` . I tried the following but none worked open -a Thunderbird ["filename1","filename2"] open -a Thunderbird [filename1,filename2] open -a Thunderbird ['filename1','filename2'] for single files `open -a Thunderbird filename` works like a charm. <comment83592> Oops, sorry. I did't tested it before posting. It seems attaching more files doesn't work. I'll edit the answer. <comment315220> FYI: you can do ```open -a Mail.app `ls *.pdf` ``` to put the reuslts of `ls` into the mail
