Textmate LaTeX bundel in OS X 10.11 <body> I upgraded to El Capitan, and now the Textmate LaTeX bundle commands don't work.  On inspection, this seems to be because the scripts implementing them use  precode#!/usr/bin/env ruby18 /code/pre  and Apple seems to have updated to ruby 2.0.  Is there a better fix than just installing ruby 1.8?  strongUpdate:/strong Just to be informative, the thing I did was:  Install an old version of ruby with homebrew  precode$ brew tap homebrew/versions $ brew install --with-suffix=18 homebrew/versions/ruby187 /code/pre  There is probably something wrong with this, since it didn't add the suffix I wanted.  The new binaries go in   precode/usr/local/opt/ruby187/bin /code/pre  So I just did  precodecd /usr/local/opt/ruby187/bin ln -s ruby ruby18 /code/pre  Then in Textmate's preferences I just appended   precode:/usr/local/opt/ruby187/bin /code/pre  to the codePATH/code variable.  Everything works again.  This seems a bit of a mess, though.  Hence the question.
