Can't delete 400 GB of files from trash can <body> I did some New Year's cleaning of my MBP's secondary hard drive. Like 400 GB of cleaning. All at the same time.   That turned out to be a terrible idea because now the trash bin is too big to even empty. The OS slowly counts up to about 1 million files and then starts the even slower countdown, but finds errors that need to be cleared out manually every 5k or so files until I finally just give up. Or it never even gets that far and just gives me an operations error.  I tried using the command codesudo rm -rvf /Volumes/Away/.Trashes//code in Terminal to some effect. It cleared out about half, but isn't clearing anything else out. I also tried the Onyx application and that claims to have cleared out some trash, but not really. It did tell me I had some disk errors though so I booted into recovery mode and fixed those.  At this point I'm out of options. I am trying to clear out folders individually, but now the only folders left are ones with tens of thousands of files. Since this is a secondary drive, I guess I could back up the data on this drive and reformat, but I don't know if that will cause MacOS to poop itself when it thinks it has 200gb in its trash bin but doesn't really. Any ideas?  I am running Sierra on a mid-2012 MBP.   <comment335226> "..but finds errors ..." What errors? Trash should normally only error if you're trying to delete something you shouldn't. <comment335252> Operation errors are what stops the trash emptying while it's still counting up. I can't remember the errors that occurred while the trash was counting down. I haven't been able to get that far in the process in a couple of days.  Right now I've mostly given up and I'm trying to pull whatever I can off the drive to then reformat and hope that doesn't break something even worse. If it does at least I have backups.
