How to cd into my local git repo from an AppleScript? <body> I am running a Mac using OSX Yosemite v10.10.5.  I want to push my local git repo to my remote using AppleScript.  So the git code would be:  shell  precodegit init git add README.md git commit -m "first commit" git remote add origin https://github.com/myusername/my-project.git git push -u origin master /code/pre  But in order to run this from the terminal, first I need to codecd/code into my local directory.  precodecd my-directory /code/pre  So how would I do all this from an AppleScript? Or the JavaScript option in the Script Editor would also help.  <answer235113> Basically you can use  precodedo shell script "cd my-directory &amp;&amp; git init" do shell script "cd my-directory &amp;&amp; git add README.md" ... /code/pre  <comment287533> Why AppleScript and not just a simple shell script? <comment287534> @patrix: Because I will be automating it using Automator. And from what I know, Automator can only run AppleScript (and maybe JavaScript too). But not shell script. But, I will take answers about shell script too. If anyone has one. It's possible I could figure out the AppleScript from the Shell script as a starting point. <comment287535> Even with Automator it might be easier to just include a "Run shell script" action and run the lines from above (including the `cd`) from there. <comment287536> @patrix: Yes, I just tried that approach. And got an error in the line after the `cd` command. So I don't think the `cd` works from shell? Maybe shell has a different means of accessing the command space inside the directory? <comment287538> Oooohhhhh. Yeah. I didn't think of the `&&`. I was doing it as a separate line. Let me try that approach. Thanks. <comment287539> Most probably the working directory of your Automator action is not what you expect it to be. Try `cd /full/path/to/my-directory` instead. If it doesn't help, please ask a new question showing both the relevant part of the Automator action and the error you are getting <comment287540> @patrix: Your answer worked. The system will let me accept it in two minutes time from now.
