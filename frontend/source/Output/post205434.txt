Harmful to never put to sleep / shut down a mac? <body> Is it harmful for a mac in any way to never put it to sleep, or to turn it off?  I have a macbook air and an iMac that I set to never sleep in the settings. Only the displays go to sleep. I turn them off once a month. I am afraid that they could be damaged over time if I keep doing it. Could it happen?  <answer205439> You can safely leave your Mac powered on all the time.  h1Safe and Harmless/h1  There is no practical damage or harm that will occur because the Mac is constantly running. Use your Mac as best suits your needs.  Restarting is helpful every so often – if only to install updates and clear out caches or temporary files.  h2Environment/h2  As 1lann mentions, environmental factors like dust and heat build-up should be considered. Keep your Mac away from sources of dust, like limestone or sandstone walls, where the fans can draw in surprising amounts of particulate matter.  <answer205466> One way I can see potential damage is wear and tear of moving parts inside the computer, such as any hard disk drives and fans. Be aware that the fan may draw in a lot of dust if the computer is constantly running, and you may need to clean the inside of your computer at one point.  <answer205868> I administer a small network of Macs, servers and iOS devices and have been doing exactly the same thing for many years, I personally think (although can't confirm) that it adds longevity to the machine, I currently have a mac mini that is 8 years old running perfectly using this practice.  <comment247708> Couldn't say for certain on MacBook/iMac but my old Mac Pro has been on for 7 years. It reboots for OS updates <comment248208> Everything in this post is entirely true. Please also note @1lann's [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/205466/656) because it addresses natural consequences of hardware use.
