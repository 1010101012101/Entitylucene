Verification of account details <body> I have an iPhone 6.br When I want to download an app from App store it asks for verification of my account. In the address section under State there is no South Africa in the dropdown and it refuse because the postal code is incorrect.br How do I correct this.??  <comment196946> is South Africa a State? I live in the UK & I'm pretty sure we don't have them, only the US. Whenever something asks for 'state' in my address I assume either, 1) the US-centric site coder needs his wrists slapping or 2) I'm on the wrong Country site for that company. <comment196949> check the postal code here http://www.sapostalcodes.info/ <comment196954> if it wants a State it hasn't yet figured out that there are any valid postcodes other than US ones. Typing a UK one into a field like that will be rejected too - especially if it insists it should be a 'zip' code rather than a postcode.
