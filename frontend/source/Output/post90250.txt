Which presentation remote controls are OS X compatible with Powerpoint? <body> I'm looking for a remote control to use for controlling a Powerpoint presentation, and want it to be compatible and reliable w/ OS X.  Any recommendations on one that functions well with Powerpoint?  <answer90253> Logitech's R800 remote works. They aren't officially supported, but they allow you to flick back and forward between slides.  <comment105936> Let's see what people think of this. Hardware shopping questions are explicitly off-topic, but if you are OK having this reflect an answer that explains how to know which are compatible or even pick some that function well in experience - that should be OK to keep open. <comment105954> I wasn't too sure if this would be off-topic.  I should probably brush up on my Meta info :)  -- the compatibility approach was of interest though. Thanks
