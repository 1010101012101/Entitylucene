How can I remove a paused app for my iphone 4? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y9egC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I want to delete that camera 360 app after I paused it but when I long pressed the app, yes the X mark was there but it is not deleting. What should I do? Please help me. I'm new in using an iphone. And another thing, I'm still not jailbreaking it. Thank you  <answer233346> If reboot doesn't work then try troubleshooting, I would do this:  ul liQuit app store/li liStart app store and go to app and try canceling or re-downloading./li liToggle Airplane Mode and try again/li liThen reboot/li /ul  <comment285168> Have you tried rebooting the iPhone?  That usually works for stuck apps.
