How can I restart Finder when it keeps "stopping" an stopped copy process? <body> Every now and then, mostly with USB sticks, Finder decides to copy forever, either at the end of the copy process (i.e. the files are already copied), or at the very beginning.  Stopping the process in the little window will make Finder announce that it is "stopping" and it will do that for a few hours.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aUdq3.png" alt="Been &quot;Stopping...&quot; for hours, probably will keep at it forever!"  I tried just killing and restarting Finder but the old Finder survives as a zombie and the new Finder never finished starting.  Is there another way of recovering from this problem other than restarting the computer?  Since I upgraded to Lion I found that restarts have become more common.  strongUpdate:/strong In Mountain Lion it would appear you can't even restart to fix it!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vaCGv.png" alt="THe Finder can&#39;t quit because some operations are still in progress. (And will be forever!)"  <answer53754> Next time this happens, look at the Finder process using codeps/code: First run this in a terminal:  precodelaunchctl list | grep Finder /code/pre  The output should be just one line, listing codecom.apple.Finder/code with a number at the beginning of the line. That number is the process ID (pid) of Finder. Now run  precodeps up xxx /code/pre  replacing xxx by the pid found in the first step. Look under the STAT heading. If you see the letter U then the Finder is stuck in an uninterruptible system call, and cannot be killed. You will most likely need to restart your system to recover.  Processes stuck in an uninterruptible system call is often a symptom of a hardware problem. It would bear further investigations to find the cause.  <answer53758> If it hasn't frozen completely, you can also how down ALT/Option on your keyboard and either right-click the Finder icon in the dock or click the Finder menu in the menubar. Either way, you'll then see an option to force restart Finder.  <answer115237> precodekillall Finder /code/pre  If you don't have codekillall/code  precodebrew install killall /code/pre  if you don't have codebrew/code  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)" /code/pre  if you don't have coderuby/code  You have it, it comes with OSX  <answer244508> kbdCommand/kbd  kbdOption/kbd + kbdEscape/kbd, Relaunch Finder,  Done  <comment61487> Did you use `killall Finder` (which sends a TERM signal) or did you use `killall -KILL Finder`? <comment61496> I used the GUI thingy. I don't know what it does. <comment61551> I did that and the above-described symptoms appeared. <comment61552> The hardware problem is most likely the USB stick Finder is copying to. So I will have to use something else to copy files if Finder is too fragile. <comment96426> What if the letter is `?E+` or `?E`, and launchctl list | grep Finder yields `7709 - 0x7fe8cd22f820.anonymous.Finder 7698 - 0x7fe8cb40b0f0.anonymous.Finder 470 - com.apple.Finder`? <comment96435> @daviewales The normal finder process would be the one without “anonymous” in its label. I have no idea what caused the other two to exist, but could speculate that Finder fires off new processes to handle copying or other tasks, and those are what you see. The letter E in the status indicate that the process is trying to exit, according to the manual page for ps. Not too sure what that means either, but maybe there are pending writes that need to be finished before the process can exit. <comment96556> I had a Finder mega crash, so I think the other two things appeared as a result of me trying to launch Finder when the previous instance hadn't properly exited yet. (Incidentally, I was unable to stop any of the Finder instances without force restarting, which was annoying.) <comment112741> For what it's worth, I had it complete after hanging there for at least 10 minutes. So if it hasn't been hours yet, it's possible that it will recover. <comment112744> In my instance when it actually did recover, it showed `S`, which `man ps` says `Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20 seconds.` <comment301341> Welcome to Ask Different.
