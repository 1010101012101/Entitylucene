Why does thunderbolt to displayport cable result in video with color bleeding? <body> I have an ASUS VE278 display, which is cable of handling VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI. I have an early 2013 model Macbook Pro, with two Thunderbolt ports, and an HDMI port. If I use the HDMI port (going through an HDMI to DVI converter cable), my ASUS display looks great, just like it did on my PC. No issues. However, if I use a "thunderbolt to displayport" adapter cable (such as this one) I get color bleeding artifacts on my screen, around contrasting colors, etc.  If I take a screen shot, everything looks fine on the screen shot (when viewed on another monitor or the Macbook's native display).  Here's a photo of the artifacting, while looking at this artifact test png image :  (it's hard to capture on camera, so forgive me):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U5RFq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Does driving a display via ThunderBolt always result in this color bleeding? I am ordering a thunderbolt to HDMI cable.. to see if that makes a difference. But what the heck is going on here?  <answer119472> Wow. So. Apparently OSX is treating my display as if it were a TV, and is only sending YCbCr color space instead of full RGB color space.  Found this article by Robert Pill that indicates the problem, and how to fix it:  strongHow to force RGB in Mac OS X/strong  ul liDownload the patch-edid.rb script from the forums thread above and put it in your home directory./li liConnect only the external monitor(s) in question (I closed my MacBook lid, for example).

Right?", quoted from [this article](https://www.panic.com/blog/the-lightning-digital-av-adapter-surprise/), see Section "Mystery #2". Could it be this is also *your* problem? <comment139346> @myhd - well, that's the lightning connector (which is used on the newer iPhones). I didn't think it applied to this situation. <comment139350> Thanks for following up. I have migrated the procedure to your answer. In the future, please don't simply provide a link.
