How to transfer information on a shared iCloud account to a new individual one? <body> I set up an iCloud account under an old email on my iPad and I used the same iCloud account for my phone.  Now I have no storage space on either device or the iCloud accounts. How do I transfer my photos, contacts, apps, etc. from the current account on my phone to the same phone but on under a different iCloud account without losing any information?  <answer245468> There's no real easy way to merge data from iCloud accounts. Your best bet is to contact AppleCare direct with that question.
