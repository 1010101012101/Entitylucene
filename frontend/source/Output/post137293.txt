Clone whole partitioning scheme to smaller disk <body> I have the following on my secondary disk. As I am not satisfied with it I would like to clone everything to the other one which is smaller unfortunately.  precode/dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Clone                   120.5 GB   disk2s2    3:                  Apple_HFS Data                    578.7 GB   disk2s3    4:          Apple_CoreStorage                         49.4 GB    disk2s4    5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk2s5 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Yosemite HD            *48.7 GB    disk3 /code/pre  I would like to clone the whole thing except making the disk2s3 (Data) smaller to compensate for the smaller drive.  Can this be done?  <comment163140> I wouldn't recommend cloning at all, but since you're asking to clone to a smaller disk I would strongly advise you not to do this. Can't you  copy the stuff you really need? <comment163678> That is what I have done eventually. But thanks for your reply.
