How to modify in OS X El Capitan‎ the list of Mail.app's email aliases via the command line <body> In OS X El Capitan‎ the Mail app (Version 9.2, storage version V3) presents the list of email aliases in the UI not anymore as a string of comma-separated email addresses. This makes it very cumbersome to bulk edit (like removing duplicates etc...) if you have a decent amount of aliases (say 20 or 30).  Is there a way to read and write this list of aliases via the command line? I looked through the codedefaults/code domain "codecom.apple.mail/code" but could not find anything. Then I looked through the plist files inside code~/Library/Mail/V3//code (like codeMailData/VIPSenders.plist/code) but couldn't find anything either.  Where is this list of aliases stored?
