Can I see how many times I reinstalled an app, after I delete it? <body> After I deleted an application from my iPhone, is there a way to find how many times that application was deleted and reinstalled on my account?  <answer221796> There is not a method to see that. Unless you can go on your router and locate the logs from about when you got it from. That would be a very hard process, nearly impossible.  <answer221806> In your iTunes account you can see Purchase History, including free apps. It won't show when it was deleted, and may not show re-installed apps.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204088  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z3sql.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer221813> Shot answer is no. Long answer is why?  <comment268638> Would require the router to keep a log of all URLs visited (which usually isn't done). Also apps reinstalled via iTunes on Mac/PC will be installed without internet traffic.
