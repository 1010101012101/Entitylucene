remove scratch from iPhone 5 front glass <body> Because I thought the gorilla glass of the iPhone 5 is pretty tuff I decided to omit a screen protection. Unfortunaltey now I have a very thin and subtle but very long (6 cm) scratch on the front glass. It is very hard to see and can only be seen at bright light and from a very specific angle and only when the display is turned off but it is still there, so ...   I always handled the device very carefully and I have no idea where this scratch came from. I suspect the rivets near the pockets of some of my jeans.  To make sure that this is really a scratch I polished the screen with a little bit of water and a glasses cleaning cloth. The proposed scratch doesn't go away.  Is there any way to get rid of this sratch?  <answer71802> Yes, probably the rivets from your jeans.  I've done that before.  A screen protector is always a good idea because of the time and money involved in replacing the touch screen.  Especially for any of the iPhones; they are expensive.  I have always loved the screen protectors from Screenguardz.  Compared to the ones at Best Buy (forget which brand), they are extremely smooth and the anti-glare is great.  Here's the one for the iPhone 5...

It looks like industrial grade stuff or something of the sort.

Hopefully it's shallow enough to not interfere with multitouch.
