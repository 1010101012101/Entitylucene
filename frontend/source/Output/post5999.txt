change colour from mailbox in Mac Mail <body> Is it possible to change the color of the mailboxes in Mac Mail?   Here an example  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSgOl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Sometimes I manage to create Silver colored mailboxes by accident so I am wondering if it is possible to label them with other colors than silver and blue.  <answer6000> No.  A silver coloured mailbox indicates that you deleted a subfolder within that mailbox.  You need to remove the parent after removing all of the subfolders.  Then the parent will disappear as expected.  <comment6250> Sure. But isn't there a other way to tag the mailboxes in other colors? <comment6260> @elhombre No.  Not that I know of.  If you find a solution please let us know, because I'm sure tonnes of people around here would love that, myself included. <comment6286> Wondering, are there other people who want such a feature? <comment6287> @elhombre - Yes.  And I have been asked by clients with Macs if such a feature does exist. <comment10220> Sad that there isn't a genius out there which can make an add-on which makes this configurations possible. I will mark your response for now as an answer.
