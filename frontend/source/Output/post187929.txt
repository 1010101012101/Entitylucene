Deleting an app and starting over <body> I want to start Jurassic world over on my iPhone but everytime I reinstall the game, it comes back to the level I deleted it at. My iCloud is off and it says nothing is stored there.   <comment222277> Do you have an account with the game? Do you have to sign in? <comment222283> Does the game use Game Center?
