How to share directory alias between user accounts <body> I'm having trouble using aliases across user accounts.  I have two existing directories:     code/Users/strongfoo/strong/stuff/codebr   code/Users/strongbar/strong/stuff/code   I'd like to alias code/Users/strongfoo/strong/stuff/code to be accessible at code/Users/Shared/stuff/code.  However, when I try and open the alias as user codebar/code it resolves to code/Users/strongbar/strong/stuff/code. I would expect the alias to resolved to the thing it's supposed to be an alias of.  What's going on here? Should I be able to use aliases in this way?  <comment201697> Works here. What was your method? Simply right click, make alias, move alias to shared? Rename if necessary - not sure from your Q whether you will end up with 2 'stuffs' in shared, one from each user. Also - is 'stuff' a system file, or random other name? <comment201711> Yep, that's the method. Strange. More specifically.. "stuff" is `~/Music/iTunes` <comment201721> Thought it might have been different for a system folder, but still working here [once i change perms on the original folder to allow the other user access] I get 2 aliases in there, named slightly differently so I know which is which
