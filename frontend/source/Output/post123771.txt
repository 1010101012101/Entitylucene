Does MS Word on Apple has any command line interface? <body> I wonder if  MS Word on Apple has any command line interface?   I tried the following:  precode$ "/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Word.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Word" --help /code/pre  but no help.  <answer123783> If you want to do some stuff on Word using the CLI AppleScript is the way to do it.   <comment144563> What are you trying to achieve? <comment144566> Joining @Robuust: What is your plan?
