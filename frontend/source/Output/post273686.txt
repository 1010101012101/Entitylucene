Apple backup corrupt or not compatible <body> Yesterday i backed up my phone in my laptop with ios 10.2 today i got a new phone with latest ios 10.2.1 but when i try to backup says this backup can not be completed cause backup is corrupt or not compatible. Please help asap  <answer273717> I'm not positive if you're getting the error while trying to make a backup of the new iPhone, or while trying to restore your old iPhone backup to the new iPhone. I wrote an article that addresses both scenarios: corrupt backup message while strongmaking/strong a backup, and corrupt backup message while strongrestoring/strong a backup. https://deciphertools.com/blog/2014_08_22_my_iphone_backup_is_corrupt/ The article splits up the issue that way as well, so be sure to look at the section appropriate for either making the backup or restoring a backup.  ul liTypically, if you're having trouble strongmaking/strong a backup, deleting the previous old incomplete backup (or renaming the folder will work if you don't want to delete anything) helps./li liIn both cases, restarting the iPhone and the computer, and changing out the USB cables is a good idea if you have another cable handy./li liA corrupt backup that you're trying to restore is usually caused by bugs in the backup. I work on software to correct those bugs and make a restorable clone of the backup./li /ul  (A lot of articles out there suggest deleting the backup, which is fine if you're having problems strongmaking/strong a backup. It's tragic advice if your problem is strongrestoring/strong that backup!)  <comment344074> Welcome to Ask Different.
