MySQL no longer starts uninstall/reinstall doesn't seem to work <body> I had MySQL installed via the MySQL installer and it was working great.  I managed to corrupt the database somehow and it wouldn't start up anymore.  I didn't have any data I needed so I figured I'd just uninstall it and reinstall.  I followed a set of directions I found on here to uninstall and then re-ran the installer and no luck.  Still won't start up.  I've been futzing with this for a few days now following various blog posts and stack exchange directions for how to supposedly start fresh with no luck and am at the end of my rope.  Any help is appreciated.  This is on Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite) running the server app.  When I try running mysqld_safe I get the following (domain.com == the domain the mac is running):  precodeusr/bin/mysqld_safe: line 398: /var/mysql/domain.com.err: Permission denied /usr/bin/mysqld_safe: line 406: /var/mysql/domain.com.err: Permission denied STOPPING server from pid file /var/mysql/domain.com.pid tee: /var/mysql/domain.com.err: Permission denied 150420 10:39:56  mysqld ended tee: /var/mysql/domain.com.err: Permission denied /code/pre  When I run mysqld I get this:  precode2015-04-20 10:46:04 0 [Warning] Using unique option prefix key_buffer instead of key_buffer_size is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Have you tried running repair permissions on your OSX partition? Open Disk Utility, select your OSX partition, and then click "Repair Permissions." Once finished, see if you can run mysqld_safe again without permissions errors. <comment216269> So I hadn't actually tried repair permissions yet.  But sadly that hasn't changed anything.  Same errors still. <comment216283> You may need to manually fix permissions on your mysql directory(ies) and files, then. Check this Stackexchange thread: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4762543/mysql-what-user-should-own-usr-local-mysql-on-mac <comment216286> Thanks I tried that.  Still exactly the same permissions errors. <comment216436> Ended up following these directions and got a working copy of MySQL going again.  Though obviously it just skipped around the issue of a normal MySQL installer version of MySQL going bad.  https://coderwall.com/p/os6woq/uninstall-all-those-broken-versions-of-mysql-and-re-install-it-with-brew-on-mac-mavericks
