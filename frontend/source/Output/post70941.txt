How to find the location of an icon file on OS X? <body> I am trying to find where the icon file is located for certificates on OS X. This is a picture of what I'm looking for:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xVad7.png" alt="enter image description here"  Do you know where OS X stores the icon for this file?  <answer70944> The following command in the terminal should search your entire hard drive for code.icns/code files:  precodefind / -iname '*.icns' /code/pre  ul licodefind/code is a command for finding files/li licode//code is the path name for the root directory (you could change this to a different path if you had some idea where the file was located`/li licode-iname '*.icns'/code searches in a case insensitive (i for insensitive in codeiname/code) way for files that match code.icns/code where code*/code is a wildcard character/li /ul  You could copy all code*.icsns/code files on the hard drivein to the code/tmp//code folder with a terminal command like this:  precodesudo find  / -iname '*.icns' -exec cp {} /tmp/ \; /code/pre  ul licodesudo/code runs the command as the super user which may give you access to more directories/li licode-exec/code means execute the following command where code{}/code is replaced by the file returned and code\;/code ends the command/li /ul  You could then browse the code/tmp/code folder in Finder until you find the file you are looking for. Then once you know its name, you could find it in the path list from the previous find command. or with a new find command. E.g., you learn it is called codefoo.icns/code, then enter codefind / -iname 'foo.icns'/code  <answer70970> I couldn't find that exact icon because I wasn't able to produce such a certificate file. If you can tell me where to find such a file, I might have better luck.  I was, however able to find a similar image. It's located at code/System/Library/Frameworks/SecurityInterface.framework/Versions/A/Resources/CertLargeStd.png/code (at least for Mac OS 10.8.2) and it looks like this:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SUaUQ.png" alt="certificate icon"br (codeCertLargeStd@2x.png/code is the one used on Retina screens.)  This is the image shown when you view a certificate in Keychain Access or Safari:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/axBPZ.png" alt="safari screenshot"  To find this image, I opened up the Safari panel above. I examined Safari's open files via Activity Monitor, and the image in question was there. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KUWHf.png" alt="Activity Monitor screenshot"  <comment82424> Didn’t know it’s possible to view an app’s open files via Activity Monitor — very nice! <comment82466> Thanks. You were completely correct, though, do you know if Apple has a higher resolution image of this somewhere? <comment82712> `Certificate Assistant.icns` and `droppedImage.png` in `/System/Library/CoreServices/Certificate Assistant.app/Contents/Resources/` are similar images at a higher resolution. <comment94644> I finally managed to reproduce the file in the screenshot — it's a Quick Look-generated preview of certificate files. Making icons larger reveals the sad truth that,unfortunately, a higher-res image does not appear to exist. http://i.stack.imgur.com/QHufs.png
