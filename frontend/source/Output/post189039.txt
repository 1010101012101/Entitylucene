Applescript to click menu item in Lightroom 5 <body> I am using a script found elsewhere on this site.  But I can't figure out how to modify it to fit my use.  As written the script activates the submenu I need but I can't figure out how to click an item on this submenu.  I've tried all the variations of the line for "Rejected" I always get an error message saying "Can't get menu xxx..."  The actual menu structure is: menu bar item: Photo, sub item with triangle: Set Flag, which expands to a submenu that includes "Rejected".  Hope that's clear.  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5" set frontmost to true tell menu bar item "Photo" of menu bar 1     click     click menu item "Set Flag" of menu 1     --works fine to here      click menu item "Rejected" of menu "Set Flag"   end tell /code/pre  end tell  <answer189052> Found this which did the trick.    precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5" set frontmost to true tell menu bar 1     tell menu bar item "Photo"         tell menu "Photo"             tell menu item "Set Flag"                 tell menu "Set Flag"                     click menu item "Rejected"                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell end tell /code/pre
