How to do multiple conditions in one formula; and/or use a string as a condition? <body> I’m trying to make a formula that does different things under different conditions in different cells. What I have is:  precodeIF(BM16=−1,1,"O")  /code/pre  This produces the letter ‘O’ for open in my case.  What I want is the above plus if BK16 is 0 and/or if BM16 is greater than -1 then the cell will produce a blank. Can this all be done in one formula?  Another way, and possibly better, to do this in my sheet would be strongIF(BM16=−1,1,"O")/strong plus check for a string generated in an adjacent cell by a different conditional: resulting in the above formula plus IF ‘string’ in a specified cell = X OTM, then generate a blank cell.  <answer190910> Replace the "0" by the second formula  precode=IF(BM16=−1,1,if(BK16&gt;0, "", if(BM16 &gt; -1 , "", "O")))  /code/pre  anything after = is a formula and can be used where you want a value
