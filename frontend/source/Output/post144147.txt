Application bundle installation problem on Mavericks! <body> I own a Macbook Pro in May, 2011 and got two DVD with it. One for installing OS X and another for Application Install. I'm currently running OS X Mavericks and now I want to install applications that came with my MBP (iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, GarageBand, iWeb etc). The problem is ... I'm unable to install those from my DVD. It says ---  The installer could not install the software.  The installer could not install the software because there was no software found to install.  What can I do now? Suggestions or any help appreciated.  <comment169818> what do you mean by Installing? just drag apps over to the hdd. <comment171183> I know how to install apps on Mac. That's a pkg file.
