Having trouble with Final Cut Pro disk space <body> When I try to load footage onto final cut pro, it says that i do not have enough disc space. Before I start loading, I have 320 GB of free space. In total, I am trying to load 5 hours of footage.   What can be the problem?  <answer43942> .DV tends to be about 4MB/sec. So 5 hours is about 18,000 seconds, so you are looking at a capture of about 72000MB, 72G so you should be fine..  Are you sure the Capture Scratch disk is set properly? Sometimes it's set to the wrong drive you want to capture to.  Check Preferences if you are using FCP, if you are using FCPX it might be somewhere else, not sure how you set capture disks in FCPX..  <answer208675> I found that System settings- Minimum allowable free space on scratch disks: Set mine to 1000MB and everythng has worked since doing this.  <comment49931> Welcome to Ask Different! Thanks for posting a question! Can you please post a screenshot of the error so we can help you? <comment49942> What version of Final Cut Pro are you using? Where are your scratch/temp/cache files located, and how much disk space is available on that volume?
