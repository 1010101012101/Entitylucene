Copying images from iMessage creates duplicates <body> This is extremely annoying problem. Few months ago I've forwarded few panoramas to a friend and it crashed her phone. Today I tried to copy &amp; paste few select pictures and instead whole pack times 8 was about to get sent. Even more frustratingly, drag &amp; drop of selected photos from iMessage copies just one item. Copy and paste is trying to copy 25x items and crashes top of the line MBP.

What are you asking?  Is it possible to send one photo at a time through iMessage, is that the question? <comment248205> Is it possible to send multiple photos? <comment248206> Yes it is, I do so quite often. <comment248224> How? Because iMessage forwards tons of pictures.
