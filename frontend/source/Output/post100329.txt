Transferring music <body> I have an iPhone 4, and using iTunes 11.0.5.5. I've been trying to upload music (mp3 and music videos) to my iPhone, but after the sync button, nothing gets uploaded. I've tried dragging items to the device, and yes, the space available changes, but again, after the codeSync/code button, nothing is uploaded. I went into options, and checked codeManually Manage Music and Videos/code, and no change. My iPhone used to be jailbroken, but I went back to the regular iOS. Can someone help me figure out how to upload music to my iPhone?    <comment118446> Can anything sync to the phone from iTunes? Also, PC or Mac?
