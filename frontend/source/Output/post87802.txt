Send audio from my laptop to my iPhone over Bluetooth <body> I have an iPhone 4, and Philips dock speakers which I use with the phone.  The dock doesn't have any aux input, and I would like to use the dock as a speaker for my laptop.  I know I can achieve it through Wi-Fi, but my laptop doesn't have one. Is there any Bluetooth alternative to send laptop audio to my iPhone?  <answer87803> Here's a similar question from another user. Someone else recommended AirFoil. I've never used any of these products, but check em out.

If a software is available which can stream music from Ubuntu(Wifi works there! ) then it is good. <comment134101> as a point of curiosity how does your laptop have bluetooth but not wifi? <comment134165> It does have both of them, but the wifi card stopped functioning, and the laptop is quite old so not keen on getting it repaired.
