Preview hangs when I try to change a jpeg <body> I just got a MacBook Pro 2016 and am learning how to use it. I am a lifelong Windows user and have lost Photoshop when switching. I want to at least be able to change the size of photos so I can e-mail them more easily.  When I open my photo in Preview and adjust the size from, say, 45 inches wide, etc., to 9 inches wide - when I try to save it or even save by renaming, it hangs.  Am I doing something wrong?  It seems so basic, I can't think that these steps can be harder than that...  Thanks for any help you can give!  <comment326185> idk the answer to your question - but you can change the size of a photo right from the email itself. Top right of your message composition pane is a resize drop-menu, once you drag a photo into it. [there's a picture of it here - http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/202037/85275] <comment326191> You should use pixels or percent of the image instead of inches.
