Access Airport signal data <body> I want to be able to write the current list of Wifi networks in airport, and their respective strengths, to a file. I would like to use some sort of bash script to do this, but I am unsure how to access the data in Airport.   <answer46667> Open Terminal.app and enter:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I /code/pre  You have to be connected to a wireless signal. The output will look similar to the following:  precode     agrCtlRSSI: -64      agrExtRSSI: 0     agrCtlNoise: -91     agrExtNoise: 0           state: running         op mode: station       lastTxRate: 130         maxRate: 144 lastAssocStatus: 0     802.11 auth: open       link auth: wpa2-psk           BSSID: 28:cf:da:b1:6:77            SSID:              MCS: 15         channel: 6 /code/pre  Most of the data is self explanatory. codeagrCtlRSSI/code is the signal strength; the closer it is to code0/code, the stronger the signal. codeagrCtlNoise/code is the noise on your Wi-Fi signal; you want this as low as possible. Finally, codemaxRate/code is the maximum rate at which your Wi-Fi signal can run at, and codelastTxRate/code is the last transmitted rate.  You can also use this Terminal command to scan the airwaves for other Wi-Fi signals to connect to (I believe this is what you were looking for):  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s /code/pre  This returns something like:  precode            SSID BSSID             RSSI CHANNEL HT CC SECURITY (auth/unicast/group)              28:cf:da:b1:06:78 -73  100,+1  Y  GB WPA2(PSK/AES/AES)             dlink 00:19:5b:de:4e:36 -90  6       N  -- WEP     FON_BELGACOM 06:19:70:1e:c3:6e -77  1       N  BE NONE       bbox2-f279 00:19:70:1e:c3:6e -77  1       N  BE WEP    telenet-6F8E6 5c:35:3b:1e:88:20 -91  11      Y  -- WPA(PSK/TKIP,AES/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/TKIP,AES/TKIP)               28:cf:da:b1:06:77 -65  6       Y  GB WPA2(PSK/AES/AES)  /code/pre  If youâ€™ll be using these commands a lot, you might want to add code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/code to your code$PATH/code, like this:  precode# Place this in your `~/.bash_profile` export PATH="/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources:$PATH" /code/pre  That way, you can simply use the codeairport/code command without typing the full path to the binary every time:  precodeairport -I airport -s /code/pre  Source  <comment53368> Cool! Thanks for that awesome answer! <comment53446> Wow very in depth, detailed answer. I'll get back to you once I try it out, thanks a ton man! <comment53448> That's just great man. Thanks a bunch. <comment53842> Hi Mathias, I did click accepted, not sure why it didn't register as that before!
