Home Sharing songs greyed out on iPad <body> I connected my iPad to Home Sharing from my laptop. I can play music by pressing shuffle play and pressing next, however I cannot choose which song to play because it is either greyed out (inside albums/artists/etc.) or it is regular but pressing it does nothing (Songs, playlists).  <answer144713> You have to fulfill 3 prerequisites:  1- WiFi has to be on  2- The power plug has to be in (Charger)  3- You must be on same network  <comment170473> I assume you tried the obvious, power cycle the iPad. I mention it because I forget that even they need it sometimes =] <comment170474> @Tyson - I did and now it just says "Unable to turn on Home Sharing"
