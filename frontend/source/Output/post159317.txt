How can I change the title of a Safari shortcut or app on iOS? <body> I would like to be able to change the title of a shortcut (especially web shortcuts set as icons). Is this possible?  For example, I have a Safari shortcut for Facebook. As an icon, it's labeled "Facebook". Can I change that to "m.facebook" or something else?  If so, how?  <answer159324> Names of apps cannot be changed on iOS unless you jailbreak and use some tweak. Although strongshortcuts/strong made from emSafari/em using "Add to homescreen" option can have custom titles. The title cannot be changed once it's been  added to the homescreen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y0Fng.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment187262> Web shortcuts made from safari to homescreen ? <comment187266> @JashJacob - yes
