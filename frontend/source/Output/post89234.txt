Adding a song file to iTunes via the command line without playing the file <body> I want to add song files to iTunes via the command line.   precode    open -a iTunes -g song.mp3 /code/pre  does exactly this. - However it starts emplaying/em the song, too. Any way to avoid this?  <answer89235> You can use the "Automatically Add to iTunes" folder for that (see HT3832):  precodecp song.mp3 ~/"Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Automatically Add to iTunes/" /code/pre  If iTunes is running, anything you copy into this folder will be imported into iTunes automatically (and deleted from the folder afterwards).  Please note:  ul liThe folder name might be language specific, so check the name on your system first./li liDepending on when iTunes was installed, the media folder may be called either codeiTunes Media/code or codeTunes Music/code/li /ul  <answer217412> You can use applescript to do so and there's much more to explore. (add music to special playlist, etc.)  for example, you need to add file /User/username/myMusic/my.mp3 to lib, create a script file named add.scpt  precodetell application "iTunes"     add alias ((path to home folder as string) &amp; "myMusic:my.mp3")  end tell /code/pre  run command:   precodeosascript add.scpt /code/pre  <comment104715> Works a treat. Thanks! <comment105688> You should use `mv` instead of `cp` so that the file is added and you are not left with a duplicate song file outside of your iTunes library. <comment157392> Not only does the "Automatically add to iTunes" folder simply not work in many instances, it doesn't work for a distributed library. <comment157427> Support for distributed libraries isn't part of the question here. But you are correct: if you distribute your iTunes library across several disks neither "Add to iTunes" nor dragging media files into the iTunes window will import in a useable way.
