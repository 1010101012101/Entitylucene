Hearing microphone input in my headset <body> I'm using a Logitech H340 headset (USB) with macOS Sierra, and have the problem that I hear the microphone input in my earphones. This occurs even when no recording is happening.  Changing the output or input device globally doesn't fix it, I still hear the microphone in my ears. Also muting input or output in applications has no effect. Muting input or output or changing volume in preferences works.  Strange is that the noise is much louder if I blow in the microphone, but voice is almost not echoed. Maybe it is a noise cancellation issue? There is no driver for this headset that I know of where I could configure something like that.
