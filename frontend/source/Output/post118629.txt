How can I restore a supervised device from iCloud <body> I have an iPad that I want supervised. I can get it supervised but if I restore from a non-supervised backup, it removes the supervision.  Is it possible to restore a device from iCloud AND keep it supervised?  <answer118635> No â€” restoring from iCloud will remove the supervision. There's no way round that, other than re-supervising the device afterwards.  <comment138496> What about an iTunes backup? <comment138497> @emd Won't help. The supervision will still be removed. <comment138539> Crappy. All I want to do is get all my home iOS devices supervised (so I can easily push out config changes like contact server, etc) but I don't want to have to set them all up again. <comment211118> Right? It'd be nice if Apple Configurator saves all the details like a iCloud backup does. It would make deploying templates so much easier.
