Run script when new user logon the first time <body> I want to run a couple of .sh scripts when the user first login after user creation to set the correct settings. I know there is a folder (/Library/StartupItems) that let you place script for running on every startup, but is there something like that for first time logon?  <answer227557> I don't know of a specific place on OS X, but a pretty common way to handle this is just to have the script run every time the user logs in, and check for the presence of a specific hidden file in the user's home directory. If the hidden file is there, do nothing and exit. If it's not there, run the first-time login procedure, and create the hidden file.  Note also the "/System/Library/User Template/[locale]" directory, which is the skeleton home directory used to create all new users' home directories. You may be able to use this to achieve what you want.  Have a look at: Modifying OS X User Template  <comment277378> Should it run once (e.g set time server, set keyboard layout) or every time the user logs in (e.g. connect to a VPN or a share)? <comment277381> Once, like when the mac ask for your apple id the first time you login a new account... <comment277383> Smart! But is there a way to run script from User Template when a user is created? That would solve my problem.. Wich folder should i use then? <comment277384> Please add the (sanitized) sh scripts or at least hints concerning their purposes. <comment277385> One of them is `defaults write com.apple.finder ShowMountedServersOnDesktop -bool true` <comment277392> https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CustomLogin.html
