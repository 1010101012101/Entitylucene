Rename file to match containing folder's name <body> I have a collection of image files grouped into folders named codeProject_01/code, codeProject_02/code, etc. Using Automator, I have composed a workflow that asks the user for a folder, and combines the images in that folder into a single PDF document. The emdestination folder/em for the output PDF file can be determined with a variable; however, the emfile name/em field of the action expects a constant string.   Is there any way, maybe through renaming, that I can Automator have the output file give the name of the containing folder, e.g. codeProject_01.pdf/code?  <answer75632> If you already have a variable with the name you want, the easiest way would be to add a strongRename Finder Items/strong action after the PDF is created. Set it to emName Single Item/em, and you can just drag in the variable as the new name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ci5ni.png" alt="rename finder items"  <comment87813> That's exactly what I needed. Thank you! I didn't even know the *variables* view existed until now!
