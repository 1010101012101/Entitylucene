Merging images on mac <body> Say you have a picture of a dog and a cat. You want to merge parts of the dog's face onto the cat's face creating a cat-dog fusion. What MacBook Pro programs can i get for free in order to do this?  <answer97778> I would suggest using GIMP. It's a free program that can offer many of the tools that Photoshop does.  <comment114754> What kind of research did you already do on this? <comment114768> I think Preview has already all the features required.
