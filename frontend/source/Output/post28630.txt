Is the iOS 5 beta no longer usable? <body> I've been using iOS5 beta 7 for a while.  About 4 hours ago (possibly the end of the 20th, PST, the expiration date for iOS 5 beta 7) the phone locked itself and claims it requires activation.  Whenever I try, it claims the activation server is temporarily unavailable.  Should I sit tight and wait, or is there something else I can do, such as wipe iOS5 and reinstall from a release image?  <answer28632> You'll have to upgrade to the release version, not much else you can do about it.  <answer28646> if your iPhone refuses to being updated to iOS 5.0, maybe you should put it in DFU (Device Firmware Update mode). To do that, follow these instructions:  ul liPlug your iPhone to your Mac/PC;   /li liHold the strongpower button/strong for 2 seconds;/li liWithout releasing the power button, hold the stronghome button/strong for 10 seconds/li liRelease the strongpower button/strong and keep holding the stronghome button/strong until your iPhone appears in iTunes;/li liProceed with software restore; you might restore your software backup at the end of the procedure./li /ul  <answer28649> The only beta still usable is the GM. So try updating to this beta.  <comment32913> How about installing iOS 5 GM? <comment32919> How about making an actual answer, instead of a comment, Dave :). <comment32923> iTunes insisted my version is up to date, so I tried the factory reset method, after which iTunes admitted it needs to download an update.  I'm 2 hours into the 4 hour download... <comment32931> Same here, but with my iPad.... <comment32952> iTunes won't automatically update the betas - to iTunes, beta 7 is the final version. You need to manually download it from developer.apple.com, or do a restore and download it that way. <comment32978> Welcome to Ask Different! Normally, questions about pre release software are off topic for this site. Since this is likely to be useful to many people and not change quickly, I'm leaving this question open. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment33016> It looks like the OP knows how to restore and is asking _whether_ to do that. Your answer is technically correct, but doesn't appear to be answering the question posed. <comment33033> GMs aren't betas. That's why they are called Gold Masters. <comment33123> With the download complete, the release version installed fine and my phone is working fine again.
