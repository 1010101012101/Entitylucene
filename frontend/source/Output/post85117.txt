How to implement this script on a Mac <body> I just read Matt Might's blog post on eliminating filler and "weasels" from my writing, and I am wondering how I would implement this on Latex to run and check my document? I know I should use terminal, but I'm not at all familiar with how Terminal accepts commands or which directory I would store the script in?   Thanks for any help.   <answer85128> You could save the script as code~/Scripts/weasels.sh/code with any text editor, and run it with codebash ~/Scripts/weasels.sh ~/Documents/input\ file.txt/code. Or if you use TextMate, you can run the script with just âŒ˜R.  If you want to run the script with codeweasels/code instead of codebash ~/Scripts/weasels.sh/code, you can make it executable and add its folder to the path:  precodemv ~/Scripts/weasels.sh ~/Scripts/weasels chmod +x ~/Scripts/weasels echo 'export PATH=~/Scripts:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile . ~/.bash_profile weasels ~/Documents/input\ file.txt /code/pre  <comment98049> What is "Latex"? <comment98058> LaTeX is a typesetting system: http://stackoverflow.com/tags/latex/info <comment98167> Hi Lauri, thanks for your help! I've created a perl file (weasels.pl) in TextMate with the three scripts from Matt's blog. Should I actually save it as "weasels.sh"? And would I run it after typing up my LaTeX document, where the foo.tex would go in place of "file.txt"? Thanks for your help. <comment98259> You should save them in separate files. And the first two scripts are shell scripts, which are commonly saved with a .sh extension (or no extension if they are executable). And yeah, it should also work with .tex files. It's probably better to start out with learning Python (look at the [Google Trends graphs](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en#q=python%20tutorial%2C%20ruby%20tutorial%2C%20perl%20tutorial%2C%20bash%20tutorial&cmpt=q) for Python vs Perl vs Ruby).
