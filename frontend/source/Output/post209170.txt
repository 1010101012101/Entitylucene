Automatically hide sidebar in preview <body> I recently upgraded to El Capitan. Whenever I open an pdf file of more than 1 pages, Preview opens the sidebar. Is there a way to permanently disable it?  <answer209699> No.  At least, none that I am aware of, and I have looked. (I'd be thrilled to find out that I’m wrong!)  However, you can sort of brute-force as solution using Keyboard Maestro.  Here’s a macro that I made:  img src="https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8f6675f7f441b5805da0e8eb1fa179726d38c861.png" alt=""  If you aren't familiar with Keyboard Maestro, what this is doing it waiting for Preview.app to launch or “activate” (i.e. if Preview.app is running and you switch to it from another app).  Then it waits until Preview.app has a window (in most cases that will mean a file has been opened).  Then it looks to see if the “Hide Sidebar” menu item exists but is not selected.  If all of those conditions are met, then it will select the “Hide Sidebar” menu item.  This isn’t a perfect solution, by far, but it emmight/em be better than nothing :-)  Download macro from Keyboard Maestro forums.  <answer213395> I was able to get this to work on 10.11.1 by adding a new key to the Preview.app plist.     PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening   You can use the defaults write command to do this in Terminal.  precodecd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/  defaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening true /code/pre  <answer213898> I needed to use  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening 1 /code/pre  for it to work.  <answer214755> Sorry, but the plain terminal command codedefaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening true/code did not work for me.  After, Preview.app opened again showing the sidebar.  I had to:  ol liopen (with Xcode) the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.plist ;/li liAdd a new item in emRoot/em with item name PVPDFSuppressSidebarOnOpening, item type emBoolean/em and type value emYES/em;/li liSave the plist file./li /ol  After that, Preview started opening without the sidebar.  <comment257631> works perfectly! thanks! <comment258251> Perfect! Thanks <comment264950> perfect! out of context, but is there a way of knowing all the options available for a program that can be changed by defaults cli? I mean, how could I know that it is available for change? thanks <comment269605> @TiagoZortéaDeConto: Great question: I wonder, too. Perhaps you could write it up as a question on this site, if it hasn't been done already. (If you do, tag me somewhere!)
