Changing the dictionary used by OS X Dictation <body> Is there any way to alter the dictionary used by OS X Dictation, i.e. add/edit/remove a word? I use OS X 10.10 a.k.a. Yosemite.  <answer159422> OS X Dictation will let you dictate people in your Contacts. Make sure any words you wish to say are included in Contacts (you can place multiple words in the first name or last name fields) and providing you have enabled Enhanced Dictation the words should be available immediately. When dictating, if an alternative word is available, the word will be underlined in blue and selecting an alternate word will, over time, allow it to learn the word as a preferred dictation result. I have not tested deleting a contact and seeing whether the word would remain in the dictation repertoire.  <comment187270> interesting question, but what is the reason? <comment187271> Because my name is Franck, not Frank. <comment187350> Thanks, good to know! Is it possible to remove a word though, or add a word which isn't a name (so as not too fill Contacts with my customized words)? (without having to create a voice command) <comment187353> @Franck See edit <comment187362> Thanks a lot. I'll try using Contacts as a custom dictionary and see how it goes! Any idea regarding removing words (in case those words are not in Contacts)? <comment187366> @Franck I don't believe this is possible as far as I am aware but would be happy to be proved wrong!
