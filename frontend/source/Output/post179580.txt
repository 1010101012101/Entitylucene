Adding a bookmark to a new folder in Safari? <body> In Chrome, when adding a new bookmark, you can choose to add it to a new folder you create at that time, through "Choose Another Folder"  "New Folder".   However, in Safari, I find if I need to do this, I have to go create the folder first in my bookmarks, then add the bookmark to this folder.  Is there any way I could do the same thing as Chrome in Safari?  <answer179622> That is the only way in Safari.   Create the New folder first then add bookmarks to it.  <comment212967> no answers so far, soâ€¦ I don't know of a way. Always folder first, afaik
