Unclear OSX notification banners: where is the cropped text? <body> Long strongtext/strong notifications banners on MacOS X are cropped. The missing text makes them hard to understand, or even incomprehensible. How can I read the full text of these banners, if nothing shows up in Notification Center?  This is a general issue, and happens with all kinds of notifications on OSX.  The example below appears when trying to call a contact from Contacts.app in Yosemite and isomething is not right, which I can not fix, because the message explaining it strongis cropped/strong/i.  Examples:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VGiNi.jpg" alt="German Software Update Notification Banner"  <answer187302> Take a look in the Notification Center by clicking this icon in the top right corner of your menu bar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FIMmj.png" alt="enter image description here"  You'll probably see the full text in the "Facetime" section.   <comment221299> Click it. idk that app, but most apps come to the front with the notification foremost <comment221305> Thanks for the fast reply. It is FaceTime, and there is no way to expand the contents of the banner / notification. Hm! <comment221306> It doesn't expand, it should bring the specific app to the front <comment221310> I do unterstand it does not expand. But what to do, when the app does not show more info, or missing text, and I can only speculate what the text (which exists "somewhere") might say? <comment221314> I've no idea in that case - I've never had an app that didn't show me all the relevant info when it came to the front <comment221322> Thank you for your answer, but there is no additional info in the Notification Center. <comment221325> Exactly the same text as in the notification popup? If so, I would assume the application in question (Facetime) didn't send any additional text as well. <comment221326> There is *no* info regarding the issue in the Notification Center.
