How can I connect and use my samsung laptop as a second screen for my Macbook Pro? <body> How can I connect and use my samsung laptop as a second screen for my Macbook Pro? Is such a thing possible?  Also, if its possible, how do I select which computer should be master/slave?  Thanks  <comment297159> Yes, but no proper way. The only option is essentially screen sharing via local network. Haven't tried it from mac to pc, but I believe [Air Display 2](https://avatron.com/applications/air-display/) can do that.
