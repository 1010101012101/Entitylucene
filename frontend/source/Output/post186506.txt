Install OS X replacing Windows on a Mac without losing data <body> My brother installed Windows 7 on my Mac. Now I am trying to install OS X Lion  but when I select Reinstall OS X, I am not able to select any drive. One of my drive has 1.27 TB of data. Is it possible to install OS X without losing data?  <answer186507> There is no way to reinstall OS X without formatting and losing data. If you want to keep your data, recover the data to another drive or to the cloud.  <answer186531> On windows create second partition formatted as ExFAT. Move data you need to second partition. Then run OS X Recovery Partition. Format first partition, install OS X. Then move data from second partition to first and delete second partition.  <comment220221> If he installed Windows via Boot Camp, you may be in luck. If he did it directly from a Windows installer USB/DVD without Boot Camp, then Windows will have destroyed the original Mac partitioning & possibly overwritten your old data. You need to edit your question & add this information, so we can go to the next step... <comment220355> That's basically same answer as I stated. <comment220431> I've just described it with more details.
