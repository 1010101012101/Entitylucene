Install nvidia-smi on OSX <body> I tried installing nvidia-smi with home-brew, but it is not working out, this is my output   precode-bash: nvidia-smi: command not found /code/pre  I have CUDA 7.5 installed and this is the output of my codenvcc -V/code command   Mine is a 15" Macbook Pro Retina, with Nvidia 750M GPU     nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver   Copyright (c) 2005-2015 NVIDIA Corporation   Built on Thu_Sep_24_00:26:39_CDT_2015   Cuda compilation tools, release 7.5, V7.5.19   Output of kextstat command  precode    kextstat | grep -i cuda   140    0 0xffffff7f82675000 0x2000     0x2000     com.nvidia.CUDA (1.1.0) 5AFE550D-6361-3897-912D-897C13FF6983 &lt;4 1&gt; /code/pre  OS version 10.11.4  <answer287627> In Macs there is no nvidia-smi command that comes with nvidia drivers. However, you could check this open-source alternative : https://github.com/phvu/cuda-smi  <comment293982> Welcome to Ask Different!  What do you mean by "it's not working out?"  What is it (not) doing?  Also, it's helpful if you provide your OS version. <comment293993> In this case simply what is your PATH and in what directory does  Homebrew install nvidia-dmi - the issue is simply the file is not found by the shell i.e. only the first two lines are relevant <comment363558> Thank you for your answer, this does give me the memory usage, but not the power and percentage of GPU usage. If there is some software, I would be glad to know!
