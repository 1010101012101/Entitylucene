How to change just the Dock hide duration? <body> Most people have seen the Terminal hack to change the Dock Hide/show duration in How can I make auto-hide/show for the dock faster?, but I was wondering if anyone has found how to set each of these to different speeds. For example, 0 second delay for the Dock to show upon mouse hover, but 1 second for it to autohide again.  <answer283018> You can change two values for the Dock when it comes to the animation speed:  strongautohide-delay/strong  precode# Dock autohide delay set to 0 seconds, the default should be around 1.0 defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0 /code/pre  hr  strongautohide-time-modifier/strong  precode# Dock animation duration to show/hide the Dock defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0 /code/pre  hr  Set the first value to 0 and the second to 1.0 in order to achieve your result. It's not possible, however, to set separate durations for the hide delay and the show delay.
