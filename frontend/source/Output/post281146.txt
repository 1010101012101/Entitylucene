Recover photos from locked iPhone 4S (no backup, no Siri) <body> I used to have an iPhone 4S, on which I took a lot of pictures which have since become very important to me. The phone had a 4 digit lock code, was never backed up or connected to iTunes and never had Siri enabled. I don't own a Mac, but could have access to one if required (either a very modern iMac or a MacBook Pro from about 8 years ago). I do have a PC, and I'm comfortable using cygwin if necessary. I did have an Apple ID connected with the phone, though I have forgotten the details about it and the lock code. My question is whether it is possible to retrieve the photos, and if so how? Any help is appreciated.    <answer281151> Adding an answerer because of insufficient reputation. You might look for some serious strongiTunes alternatives/strong to check your link. I found a list of iTunes alternatives here which might be able to recover your photos and other data.
