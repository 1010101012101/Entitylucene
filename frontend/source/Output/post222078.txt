Cant get my purchased app on my iPad <body> I purchased a game on my iPhone and can download it to my iPad. But it says that I still need to purchase it to not to play in the "free mode". I have already paid on my iPhone. The iPad and the iPhone, both are associated with the same account.  <comment269025> Sounds like the purchase you made was an in-game purchase...  and that company likely doesn't transfer those between devices.    So the app is free...  but any purchases you make in the app to unlock it are device specific. <comment269429> The app would have to have a "restore purchases" function that you need to perform.
