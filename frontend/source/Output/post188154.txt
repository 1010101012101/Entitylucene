Slow to install an enterprise IPA on a real device <body> I'm creating enterprise signed builds of an iOS app for our test team. The app is 1.5 gigabytes. When I compile and run from Xcode it takes a couple of minutes to install. If I create an IPA and have them drag it into the device browser in Xcode, it can take an hour to install.  Has anyone who has seen this behavior found a way to speed the install? Jailbreaking is not an option.  <answer188171> I found someone offline who had a solution.  ul liUnzip the IPA. (In Finder you can rename it from .ipa to .zip then double-click on it)./li liOpen the resulting folder called "Payload"./li liDrag the file in the folder into Xcode devices (or iTunes)./li /ul  Copying is much, much faster than dragging the IPA.  <answer188172> Installing through Xcode doesn't compress the app: it just downloads the binary to the device. An .ipa is a .zip file with a different extensionâ€”it's compressed, and 1.5 GB takes a while to decompress on an iOS device.  <comment222630> Amazing how long it takes compared to on a MacBook Pro!
