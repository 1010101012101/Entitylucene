Sync mail settings from iPhone Mail.app to Mac Mail.app <body> I'd gotten an iPhone 5 earlier on in the year and managed to set up my Hotmail/Outlook account with no hassles. This week I bought an 11" MacBook Air and setting up the same account on my Macbook is far more complicated. The SMTP server settings for Outlook don't seem to work! So basically, I can receive emails, but can't send them. I was wondering if there was a way to just sync the email account which is already on my phone with the Mail app on my laptop?  <comment117787> Do you want to sync the email provider settings or the content of your mailbox? <comment117806> You're using the settings shown on [this page](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app) under the "Apps that support POP3 or SMTP" toggle?
