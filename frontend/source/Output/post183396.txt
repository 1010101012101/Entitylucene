Are the iPhone 4 charger and iPod 4 charger different? <body> Are the iPhone 4 charger and iPod 4 charger different? I can charge my iPhone with both, but my iPhone charger will not charge my iPod. (I'm thinking it might be the length of the 30-pin connector, because the iPod touch is curved) I know the outlet and wall adapter work.  <answer183398> No, they aren't. Here you can find the two type of charger, 5W (iPod and iPhone charger) and 12W (iPad, iPod, iPhone charger) with compatibility list. The length of 30 pin connector is always the same (it is standardised for Apple).  <answer218584> Yes it is the same and you can charge them with both which is very handy.  <comment218799> You do mean the length, right? (Front to back) <comment219111> I mean the length of the metal connector (pin) is always the same. So it is fully compliant with iPhone and iPod (even if it is curved). <comment219134> With my iPhone charger, I've found that it has to be inserted a little more than comfortable into my iPod for it to charge. <comment264272> Do you have a source for this?
