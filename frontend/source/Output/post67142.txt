Prevent dock from auto-showing on mouse over <body> I currently have dock to auto-hide and would like it to stay hidden until I explicitly show it using a keyboard shortcut such as the "Move focus to dock" or "Turn Dock Hiding On/Off". I basically don't want it to inadvertently pop open when I move mouse to the edge of the screen (e.g., to access a scrollbar in a fullscreen app), and get in the way. I tried moving it to the left, which slightly reduced the inconvenience, but I am still ending up triggering it, as I use many apps in fullscreen mode, and tend to reach out to all sides. Since I am a heavy keyboard user, I don't mind occasionally using keyboard to select something in the dock (I map Ctrl+Esc to move focus to dock, and type the first one or two chars of the app to select it and press  to run it).  I have come across workarounds that work well to (effectively permanently) disable it, but not good for my use case. E.g., this one to slow it down and this one to make it one pixel high and http://www.chaoticsoftware.com/extras.html.  I looked through all the dock defaults by running command codedefaults find .dock/code, and nothing seemed relevant, but may be I missed something because it wasn't obvious, or may be because it has no entry (like a hidden default?). Anybody has any solutions or ideas?  <answer67236> There's another hidden preference for the delay before the animation starts:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 9999999 osascript -e 'quit app "Dock"' /code/pre  It doesn't affect full screen windows though.  This would increase the delay to about a second:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0.5 /code/pre  <comment79271> This doesn't seem to make any difference, is this supposed to work on snow leopard? <comment79315> I don't have an installation of 10.6 anymore, but it works for me on 10.8. <comment79349> I wonder if it is specific to 10.8. Could you tell me how you came across this hidden setting, just to go back and look for more information? <comment79350> I think I found it independently with [gdb](http://arcticmac.home.comcast.net/~arcticmac/tutorials/gdbFindingPrefs.html), but it's also been mentioned on a lot of websites like [Mac OS X Hints](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20120326061614691) and [OS X Daily](http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/27/remove-auto-hide-dock-delay-mac-os-x/). <comment79459> Thanks for the links. On Mac OS X Hints, couple of people mentioned that it didn't work in leopard and snow leopard, but one person said it worked in snow leopard, not sure what the difference is.
