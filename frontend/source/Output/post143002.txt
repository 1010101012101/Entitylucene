What is mdflagwriter and why does it eat up so much RAM? <body> On my Mavericks 10.9.4 instance of codemdflagwriter/code eats up 2.18G of RAM. I know that it's somehow related to Spotlight, but what is it exactly and why is it so RAM-hungry?  <answer143004> code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework/Versions/A/Support/mdflagwriter/code is part of Spotlight's indexing. There seems to be a bug present for some people where mdflagwriter uses a considerable amount of RAM, but no canonical fix, apart from reinstalling OS X, or for some people reindexing with codesudo mdutil -E //code.  <comment168449> Thanks. Well, reinstalling is not an option, luckily I have 32G RAM, so I'll just leave it at what it is, will try to reindex stuff as well.
