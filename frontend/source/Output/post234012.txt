strange network issue after new router 'unkownXX…' terminal promt instead of Name <body> Some weeks ago I got a new router* and since then I encounter some local network issues from time to time (at the moment I can’t reproduce emwhen/em this happens):  ol liWifi is connected but webpages don’t load. The page stays blank and I get emno/em message about a missing network connection./li liAccessing codetobis-mac.local/code (or codehttp://localhost/code, or codehttp://127.0.0.1/code) is really slow or don’t load at all (same as 1). When I disable wifi (i.e. no network connection for my mac) the local host again is as fast as usual./li liWhile this happens The terminal promo reads  precodeunkown7cd1XXXXXXXXX:~ Tobi$ /code/pre  (I replaced some digits with codeX/code because I have no idea if this info should be kept private …) instead of the normal  precodeTobis-Mac:~ Tobi$ /code/pre/li /ol  Some setup information  ul liI’m using a MacBook Pro mid 2012 13" running OS X 10.11.4 (I made the update today. The described error occurred under 10.11.3, though)./li liMy Mac is connected via Wifi; Wifi uses 2.4 GHz only and WPA (no WPS)/li liThe router is the one I got from my provider, which is o2 Germany: o2 HomeBox 6641. ZyXEL Communications Corp./li /ul  I’m aware that my descriptions are rather incomplete but I am far from being an network expert so let me know if I can provide further information ;-)  <comment286031> btw. I would also appreciate if someone could name some relevant google search terms, because I didn’t found anything myself about this issue, cause a lack of the right key words.
