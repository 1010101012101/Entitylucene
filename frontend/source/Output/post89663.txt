mail and mailx fail to send emails to gmail <body> Quite frequently I have to send the outputs of my work on terminal (e.g. when compiling code) to my colleagues via email. I was wondering if it is possible to pipe (code|/code) the output of a terminal command directly to email and I realized there are codemail/code and codemailx/code that can be used for this purpose.   The problem is, when I try a simple message like this  precodels -laF | mailx -s 'generated files' colleague@gmail.com /code/pre  nothing is sent. How should I tackle this problem? In this post a very similar situation is asked and something is suggested but it's not the solution anymore.  <answer89665> OS X has postfix installed by default but it's not enabled (started). You can start it with  precodesudo postfix start /code/pre  you can check the status and eventual problems in code/var/log/mail.log/code  The configuration is in code/etc/postfix//code   <comment105333> Thank you. I started `postfix` as you said and tried again and failed again! checking the log it is telling me   `[my ip]:25: opration time out`  any suggestions? <comment105335> Do you have any firewall? <comment105363> I tried from home and it seems it is working. Probably it was a problem with internet connection at my work palace. Just one last question, should I `stop postfix` after or I can leave it running? <comment105386> You can leave it running. I would look online for the manual and check the configuration but as far as I remember the default settings are OK.
