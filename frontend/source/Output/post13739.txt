iTunes fails to subsribe to a podcast <body> I am using iTunes 10.2 on Windows 7 32bit I am trying to subscribe to a video podcast (Tekzilla) and I am getting an error message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V1UWo.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've been trying to do that for a couple of days and I'm getting the same error message so I guess the problem is on my side, somehow....  <answer13740> Try subscribing directly to the feed.  Under the "advanced" menu, select "subscribe to podcastâ€¦". Then, enter one of the feeds found on Tekzilla's website.  <answer14100> Found the issue. removing all the iTunes rules from the Windows Firewall and adding a single rule that allows all traffic for the iTunes executable solves this issue.  <comment14600> works. but I still wonder why I get this annoying error...
