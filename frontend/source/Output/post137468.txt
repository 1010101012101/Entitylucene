Force OS X Finder to always show dimensions of images in sidebar <body> OS X Finder does sometimes, but not always, show the dimensions of an image selected in Finder, in the sidebar. Why? Is there a way to force it to always show the dimensions? It seems very arbitrary when it decides to show and not to show.  Note: this folder is on a local drive - the default Macintosh HD.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DVfN4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189478> Here is what worked for me in OS X 10.10.3  ol liOpen all the images in Preview.app at the same time; drag them all to Preview.app /li liWith the Preview.app strongThumbnails Sidebar/strong (alt command 2) and the Preview.app strongInspector window/strong open (command i) use the arrow keys (up/down) to view through all of the images. Each one should be open long enough for you to see the images dimensions in the Inspector window./li liClose Preview.app and now the strongFinder Preview/strong sidebar will now show the image dimensions./li /ol  <answer190231> You might need to re-index the directories on your system by doing the following:  ol liGo to codeApple &gt; System Preferences &gt; Spotlight/code and chose the codePrivacy/code tab./li liDrag a directory (or an entire volume) into the list, and confirm the action/li liRemove the directory (or volume) from the list via code-/code it, which will trigger a re-index of the directory or volume./li /ol  Source  <comment215085> This is still buggy in current OS X (Yosemite 10.10.3). I should not that Finder mostly does not show the dimensions when the file is located on a network drive, or if local, resides in a folder which is part of some kind of "package" - I guess Finder assumes that file that are in packages are compressed or something and won't use resources to get such info to the user.
