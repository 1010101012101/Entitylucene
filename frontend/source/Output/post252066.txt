AppleMail can not remove specific emails <body> I'm trying to delete obvious (virus, spam, scam) email anyway from Apple's Mail.app.  Getting error: codeFile 7936.emlx could not be opened, because the file doesn't exist./code  That's rough translate from the Finnish error I get. However, when I click that mail in trash I can see it warning from trashmail.  I'm using Avira but disabling it didn't help, also avira can not remove it because of the same error, however avira shows it as quarantined thread as well...   OSX El Capitan 10.11.6 and Apple Mail 9.3 (3124)  <answer252073> One big change since El Capitan - strongMail is now in V3/strongbr Earlier OSes used the V2 folder.

At the bottom of the pane choose the Rebuild option. If you have a large mailbox, you can expect the process to take a few hours./li   liYou must repeat this step for each one of your Mailboxes./li   liWhile the process takes place, you may experience system performance lag, as it can consume a lot of system resources and memory./li   /ul      Another caveat, if you use IMAP or Exchange with any of the accounts, the process will redownload every message from the server, so you'll use a lot of bandwidth.      Now that you've completed these steps, work with Mail a little longer. If you are still having issues, or Mail fails to launch, you should try a manual reindex.      strongStep 2: Re-index/strong      Manual reindexing of Mail messages is the only way to go if the  application has become so unresponsive it barely works at all, search is not functioning correctly or the app won't launch.      Mail will automatically attempt to reindex your messages if it detects problems with the mailboxes, but sometimes a manual reindex is the best option. If you are still having problems with Mail after following step one, try manual reindexing.      ul   liQuit Mail if it’s open.br   To get to your home Library folder, hold down the Option key, then in the Finder choose Go  Library.  /li   liIn code~/Library/Mail/V3/MailData/code, delete any file that begins with “Envelope Index,” such as Envelope Index or Envelope Index-shm.

Slightly different version of the same thing at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/174732/85275 <comment313560> the last one did the trick, I had to manually delete the Envelope Index files, then it took a while to do stuff like "import" mails etc... <comment313561> Glad you got it:) Let me drop that across as an answer, as it's not really a duplicate of the other question, so might be easier for future Googlers to find. <comment313743> I think that some (most) of the Mail.app searching is done by the Spotlight system, and just rebuilding the "Envelope" indexes will not get the Spotlight index rebuilt like https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201716 or using something like Onyx  http://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html <comment313749> Presumably, if it's doing its job, it will see things have changed & re-index it. It fixed the OP's issue anyway. <comment313996> I just thought that since your solution said it was applicable if "search is not functioning correctly" that adding info about Spotlight re-indexing would be good. Mail.app does not index message contents, so having Mail.app rebuild its indexes will not have Spotlight rebuild the content searching indexes.
