Activitate Voice Dictation from Bluetooth Keyboard <body> Getting to know my new iPad and I really like the voice dictation, but I can't figure out how to activate it from my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard. My workaround is to turn off the keyboard so I get the onscreen version. Is there a better way?  <answer46063> As of iOS 5.1, Voice Dictation is not capable of being started from external keyboards.   There is a workaround.  The solution is that when you want to dictate, press the kbd‚èè/kbd key (eject) on your external keyboard.  This should bring up the virtual keyboard on the screen, from which you can then start dictation.  Note: emThis key doesn't work like other function keys until you have tapped into a text entry field and have the flashing cursor./em  <answer268013> press the keyboard tab (first line) when you want to switch between keyboards. They mic will work after that. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard on my Ipad Air 2. I hope it helps.  <comment52606> That is a better workaround indeed. Thank you. <comment52660> @HenrikBennetsen: Not a problem! <comment151091> this did not work on my zag keyboard that key closes the app.
