Can't update Java due to apparently newer version already installed <body> I'm trying to update Java on my MacBook (OS X 10.9.5). When I download the most resent version (v8 update 40) from java.com and try to install it, it pops up an error box saying     You are trying to install 1.8.40.27, however 14.9.0 is already installed   and that's it. In a terminal I get  precodejava -version java version "1.6.0_65" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-462, mixed mode) /code/pre  But Firefox → Tools → Add-ons shows Java 14.9.0 (and says it's outdated), though there is no option to de-install it.   So, how can I install the most recent Java 8.40? How can I uninstall this mysterious Java 14.9.0?  <answer177672> According to apple.discussions.com the install of Java8 should work after removing an older Java plugin with the following command:  precodesudo rm -fr /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin /code/pre  <comment210236> That did it for me (somehow that discussion didn't show up on my searches). However, `/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin` was only a link to another location, so the `rm` only removed the link, but not the directory linked to. Shouldn't I remove that to? <comment210240> @Walter Where does (or better did) the alias link to? <comment210242> to  `/System/Library/Java/Support/CoreDeploy.bundle/Contents/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin` <comment210244> @Walter This is the old (1.6) plugin from Apple. After installing Java 8 you will have a new one at "/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/". You may just leave the old one where it is. <comment210247> Why should I keep it there? Is it ever needed again? Why '(1.6)'? What about the whole directory at `/System/Library/Java`? Is this still needed? <comment210252> @Walter You may completely [uninstall](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/74243/uninstall-java-mountain-lion) Java6 (also check the [linked](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24131/uninstalling-java-on-lion) question there) and install [JDK8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) instead. You will get a proper `java -version`  output then. <comment210264> I'm not using java directly, so won't need JDK8, but you didn't answer my questions from the previous comment. <comment210265> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/22162/discussion-between-klanomath-and-walter). <comment213070> The java command line does not show the version used in the browser - do you just want to update the browser? Where exactly in Firefox Add ons dopes it show Java - In plugins I have Java Applet Plug-in  Java 8 Update 49 <comment213084> thanks Mark. I have sorted this now using klanomath's answer.
