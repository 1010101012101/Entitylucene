New user notifications on Telegram app <body> I keep getting notifications when a new user in my contacts joins telegram. Is there a way to disable this?   <answer202735> You can't filter some notifications, but you can stop them all.  ul liOpen the settings app./li liSelect notifications./li liScroll down to the app in question and disable notifications./li /ul  If you need an app to have granular control of notifications, open a bug report with the vendor of the app or see if an alternate app can work with the service.  <answer219245> you just can't do this. telegram have no option to disable new users joining notifications. all or nothing via general notifications settings.  <answer236949> Short answer is: no!  No way to really disable Contact Joined notifications with Telegram in iOS.  But, if you prevent Telegram from having access to your contacts, it will stop the notifications, but it's not without side effects, like not knowing who sent you a message, so, I don't think it's a viable option.   <comment244551> Do you know how to disable notifications from iOS settings? Or is this more a question on how to configure that specific app? The former is easy to answer, the latter might be better off taken to the vendor support pages or more research done to avoid getting this closed as basic customer support. See [ask] <comment244552> The former. How to disable it. I don't know how to, thus the question. I'd want to know how. <comment244554> Will that disable all notifications or just when a new user joins? I just don't want to get a notification when a new user joins who's from my contacts list. <comment244555> @user483071 The OS can't filter among certain notifications, you'd need to  configure the app for that. (which is why I commented for clarification in the main question earlier). <comment244556> Sorry for the ambiguity. So, I need to configure the app by self?
