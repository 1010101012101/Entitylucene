Opening photo Library from finder induces an infinite "crash-open loop" on OSX (El Capitan and Sierra) <body> I am having the strangest problem with my photo library. This has been going on for a while.   I can access my photo library by launching the "photos" app but strongwhen I try to access them by opening my Photo Library from finder/strong, the app strongcrashes immediately upon startup/strong and strongrelaunches right away and then crashes again/strong. And strongthis keeps on happening indefinitely/strong so that I can't do anything besides shutting down power.   So far I got around the problem by always launching the app first but now I want to make a backup of my library for later use on another disk and be able to access it by simply clicking is should be possible.   Couldn't find anything about this anywhere online.  Maybe if I could reinstall the app but is there a way to do that without having to reinstall the whole mac os ? Any help would be very much appreciated.
