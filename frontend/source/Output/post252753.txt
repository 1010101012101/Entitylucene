XCode 8.0 Free space requirement <body> I am trying to update XCode to 8.0. However I am getting      strongWe could not complete your update/strongbr   There is not enough disk space available to install the product.   I have got 14.22 GB free space. How much do I need?  UPDATE: I do not know the exact figure though I did manage to update with 17.21 GB free space later on.  OS is 10.11.6 El Capitan  <answer252761> You'll need about 20GB free to do the install when you consider the space needed for holding/swapping files with the .dmg during the install process.   I saw this in the app developer forum:      Have a look at codeAbout This Mac → Storage/code tab.  You might see a purple   segment labeled "Backups."  That's the local Time Machine cache, and   it doesn't show up in the Finder's free space display because it can   theoretically be purged if that space is needed.   <comment314768> Thanks. I have cleaned system and freed for 20 GB, and its updating xcode now . <comment315618> It appears you don't need to clear out enough free space, the OP was able to get it work by some method not mentioned in either the question or the answer. <comment324048> 20G is well beyond outrageous but yeah… Apple.
