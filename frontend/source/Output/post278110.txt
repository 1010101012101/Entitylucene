In macOS 10.11, can I change the default gateway so that connections don't through a VPN by default? <body> I have a system running macOS 10.11. I'm curious if it's possible for me to connect that system to a VPN (specifically an IKEv2 VPN) but still have non-local connections emnot/em go through the VPN by default. Basically I want to change my default gateway to my router rather than the VPN. The idea is that if I can do this, I can set specific applications to use the VPN's network interface if I want them to connect through it, but everything else doesn't use the VPN and connects to the internet normally.  I've tried using the coderoute/code command like so:  precoderoute delete default (or) route change default -interface en1 /code/pre  ...but it doesn't work. It seems to cause DNS lookups to fail, so while connecting to any host I've already recently connected to will work and not use the VPN, and new host lookups fail and my internet connection stops working. Furthermore, I'm not sure if I'm handling IPv6 connections properly with this method.  The only other info I've found is from this question but it's quite out of date and none of the answers helped me.  How do I go about doing this?
