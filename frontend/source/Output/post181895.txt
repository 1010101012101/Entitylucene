Get cell value by address string in Numbers <body> In Numbers 3.5.2 I manage to get a cell address sting (I compute it based on some data). Now when I have it, how can I get the value behind that address without copying the result of my function to the another cell and adding code=/code before it?  <answer181904> There's the strongINDIRECT/strong function, which returns the contents of a cell or range referenced by an address specified as a string.  example:  precodeINDIRECT("B2") /code/pre  hr  Here's Apple documentation about Numbers.app functions.  <comment216399> Thanks. For some reason I couldn't find it.
