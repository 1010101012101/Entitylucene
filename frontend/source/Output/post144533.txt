Can't uninstall MacFuse in Mavericks <body> I recently upgraded from snow leopard to mavericks and couldn't mount a truecrypt volume that was on an NTFS partition (which had always worked before). Following some advice on a forum, I installed osxfuse which didn't solve the problem but stopped the mac booting.  After rebooting in safe mode, it seems I had both MacFuse and osxFuse installed. I was able to uninstall osxfuse and now the mac boots ok, but since osxFuse is supposed to be a successor to MacFuse, I presume I should really be uninstalling MacFuse.  If try to uninstall MAcFuse from the system preferences it asks for the system password and appears to be removing it, but then afterwards still shows version 2.0.3 installed.  To be honest I've never heard of either of these two programs before yesterday. I have no idea whether MacFuse was already installed before the Mavericks upgrade or whether having both installed at the same time was the cause of the boot failure.  Am I right in assuming that if I want to mount a truecrypt volume on an NTFS partition from Mavericks, I need to have only OsxFuse and not MacFuse installed? If so can anyone help me with how to uninstall MacFuse?  <answer171469> I found uninstallation instructions for MacFUSE in this blog post. They worked for me with a little tweaking.  First, find the uninstall script that comes with MacFUSE. For the blog post author, it was code/Library/Filesystems/fuse.fs/code, and for me, it was code/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/uninstall-macfuse-core.sh/code.  If you try running the script, it will give the following error:  precodeMacFUSE Uninstaller: Can not find the Archive.bom for MacFUSE Core package. /code/pre  To fix this, you need to edit a codecase/code statement inside the script, so that it is able to match your version of OS X. Open the script with codesudo nano uninstall-macfuse-core.sh/code. (I needed codesudo/code to be able to save my changes to the file. And you can use codevim/code instead of codenano/code if you like.) Then search the code for codeuname/code to get to this section:  pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"codeOS_RELEASE=`/usr/bin/uname -r` case "$OS_RELEASE" in   8*)     log "Incorrect uninstall. Use the Tiger version please."     exit 1     ;;   9*)     PACKAGE_RECEIPT="$INSTALL_VOLUME/Library/Receipts/MacFUSE Core.pkg"     OUTER_PACKAGE_RECEIPT="$INSTALL_VOLUME/Library/Receipts/MacFUSE.pkg"     BOMFILE="$PACKAGE_RECEIPT/Contents/Archive.bom"     ;;   10*)      PACKAGE_RECEIPT=""      BOMFILE="$INSTALL_VOLUME/var/db/receipts/com.google.macfuse.core.bom"      ;; esac /code/pre  The case that you want run is the one for code10*/code.  First, confirm that there is indeed a file at code/var/db/receipts/com.google.macfuse.core.bom/code. The file was there for me, but for the blog post author it was in code/Library/Receipts/boms/com.google.macfuse.core.bom/code instead – if this is the case, change the path in the script.  The reason the case currently isn’t running is because code/usr/bin/uname -r/code doesn’t start with any of those numbers – it’s “13.4.0” for me. So change this line of the case statement:  precode  10*) /code/pre  to this, which matches versions 10 through 19:  precode  1[0-9]*) /code/pre  Save the file and exit your editor. Now run the uninstall script and it should work this time. It prints output along these lines:  precodeMacFUSE Uninstaller: Sudoing...

Just launch System Preferences, right-click on the preference pane, and choose the menu item ‘Remove “MacFuse” Preference Pane’.
