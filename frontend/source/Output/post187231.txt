Any way to get a calendar to show partial days <body> Is there any Mac (and iOS) program that can display entries in a calendar like that below  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZkSA.png" alt="Calendar" This is how my work calendar outputs. You can see a multiday event (eg starts Sunday 1st evening and finishes Wednesday 4th 1am)  However I cant edit it or add any items to it. Google Calendar and iCal dont have the desired multiday features. Would preferably sync between devices but not essential  Thanks
