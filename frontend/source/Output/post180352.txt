Bootcamp won't start after resizing partition <body> My system is divided in two and shared using Boot Camp feature. Recently I needed more space on the Mac partition and whiled loaded only in the Windows partition, I have shrank my Windows partition by 10 Gb using Windows disk management tool.  Now I can no longer start up the Boot Camp bridge while in the Mac OS X side to access the Windows partition. I suspect the Boot Camp file no longer recognize this modified Windows partition.  Is there a quick to solve this issue without having to reinstall everything?  <answer181832> This error occurred because in a Boot Camp setup, your hard drive has a hybrid GPT/MBR partition table, which is unsupported by Microsoft.  When you resized the partition in Windows, it only modified the MBR partition table because it was unaware that the GPT table existed.  You now have a situation where the GPT partition table and the MBR partition table disagree about the start/end boundaries of the Windows partition.  To fix this, you will need to use the codegpt/code command line tool, and for that you must boot from OS X install media (either a USB flash drive, or Internet Recovery if your model supports that feature -- the recovery partition will not work for this).  ol liBoot from OS X install media and open up a command prompt./li liType codefdisk /dev/disk0/code to see the MBR partition table. Write down the partition number (it's usually 4), the start sector, and the size of the Windows partition. The start sector and size will be big numbers so make sure you write them down correctly.  This is critical./li liType codediskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0/code  This will unmount the disk so GPT can write to it./li liType codegpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0/code strongNOTE/strong that the '4' here references the partition number of your Windows partition you got from codefdisk/code earlier.  This will delete the GPT partition entry for your Windows partition (but not the MBR entry)/li liType codefdisk -d /dev/disk0 &gt;/Volumes/fdisk.txt/code  This will  make a backup of the MBR partition table./li liType codefdisk -e /dev/disk0/code  This will put the codefdisk/code command in interactive edit mode. You will need to enter the following input.br strongNOTE/strong that the '4' here references the partition number of your Windows partition you got from codefdisk/code earlier.  This will delete the MBR partition entry for your Windows partition.  precodee 4 0 q y /code/pre/li liType codediskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0/code again because the codegpt/code command caused OS X to remount the disk and we need to modify it again./li liType codegpt add -b &lt;start sector&gt; -s &lt;size&gt; -i 4 -t windows /dev/disk0/code where 'start sector', 'size', and '4' are the values you wrote down from the codefdisk/code command earlier./li liFor good measure, type codegpt show /dev/disk0/code to view the GPT table.

You should be able to reboot the Mac into either operating system now.  <comment214252> I suppose if the gpt now differs from the MBR table you may not be able to boot back to Windows. If your Mac is new enough to boot from the internet then you could just enter the gpt command from a terminal to correct the problem. <comment216706> Thank you for editing that for me, @DavidAnderson. You took some work off my shoulders! <comment265462> hi, in this part it returns me error :" Type diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0 This will unmount the disk so GPT can write to it." unmount failed for dev/disk0 nad i use force command but its not working too . please help me i have same problem. :( <comment265555> You must be booted from external media for this command to work. Either from a USB stick or Internet Recovery (i.e. Cmd+Opt+R).  Booting to the recovery environment (Cmd+R) is not sufficient, as you will be booted from a partition of the disk you're trying to modify. You can't unmount the disk in that scenario. <comment265658> how i can boot from external USB? i try to boot from internet but i faced that problem again. @wesSayeed
