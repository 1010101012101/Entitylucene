An app for iPhone to share photos as thumbnail galleries <body> I am using Dropbox to sync pictures from iPhone to my MacBook and that works nicely. However, sometimes I take pictures just to post them on some forum and it would be great to have an app where I could just select a couple of photos and have them automatically resized to a web friendly size, and uploaded them somewhere I can link to. Or download the thumbnails and use them, for example, on eBay.  With the Dropbox-based workflow I still have to resize them manually and share them via the public folder, which sounds like something to automate.
