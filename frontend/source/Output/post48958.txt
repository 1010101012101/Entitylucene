Where does OS X store unsaved TextEdit documents? <body> Where does Mac OS X store TextEdit's unsaved documents?  I want to programmatically:  ol liincrease/decrease that size/li liflush the cache/li liprovide configuration option to control the frequency of auto saving/caching/li /ol  <answer48962> For Lion: It is in code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave\ Information//code, e.g. codeUnsaved TextEdit Document.rtf/code.   Note that ~/Library is not visible by default in Finder in Lion, but you can access it by pasting the path in Finder (without the backslash in "Autosave Information"; the formatting above is for cd-ing in Terminal.app), or there is an option to enable the visibility (codechflags nohidden ~/Library/code)  For Snow Leopard (credit goes to @binarybob, his comment is below) it is in code~/Library/Autosave Information/code also named codeUnsaved TextEdit Document.rtf/code  <answer258024> Note: For macOS Mavericks, the path is slightly different. It's code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Documents/code.  <comment56033> I'm pretty sure you won't be able to do #1: the mechanisms available for OS X and TextEdit to keep the unsaved documents don't depend on a static size; the storage space will grow or shrink as needed. <comment56034> what do you mean by static size ? i am keenly interested to locate the place where OSX keeps these unsaved files from the TextEdit. <comment56035> Thanks for the response . I do'nt have a containers folder ? where else can i look ? <comment56037> Which OS X version are you using? Are you sure that you are looking in `~/Library` and not `/Library`? Finally, try to create unsaved document in Text Edit, and see if the directory appears; it may not be there by default. <comment56047> @JayD On Lion, its in the path as @lupincho states. On Snow Leopard, it appears in `~/Library/Autosave Information` also named `Unsaved TextEdit Document.rtf` <comment56087> "Static" as in "unchanging". There's nothing saying "this file will be X megabytes" anywhere: it's allowed to float to be as big as it needs to be. <comment56168> @binarybob thanks for the OS flavor specific location. Had you written an answer, i would chosen it. :-) <comment56179> @JayD Thanks, but the existing answer already provided correct information, all I did was augment it :) If lupincho wants to add my comment to the actual answer, I'm more than happy for that to happen. <comment56191> @binarybob: I added your comment to the answer. <comment164320> What about Mavericks ? <comment164322> **Be careful, TextEdit forgets to resume some documents.** In Mavericks, I look in `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information`, and what a surprise ! I find about 40 documents stored. In TextEdit I have only 13 documents. In resuming the sessions, week after week, TextEdit has lost many other documents — I have not closed them. The good news is that these documents did not get deleted. The bad news is that TextEdit forgot to restore many of these documents. <comment165863> **Be careful, in Mavericks, TextEdit forgets to save and restore RTF documents.**
