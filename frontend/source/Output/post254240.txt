How can I inspect the default TCP stack in OS X for custom configurations? <body> I have the following issues in OS X:  ul liUsing Safari, or another browser, gives a "server not available, and requires me to hit refresh to make the page load/li liTelnet to www.ups.com port 80 fails, while telnet to ups.com:80 works/li liI'm behind a Many:1 NAT on a wifi network.  Other devices on the network have the same IP address according to whatismyip.com /li liSwitching the connection from Wifi, to my iPhone (tether) works fine./li /ul  Before I check in with the skeptical network guys, is there any things I can look at on the OS X side to make sure my TCP stack/ and WIFI config is default?   The only custom item I have installed is OpenDNS's "umbrella" which protects my DNS queries, and prevents me from surfing bad links.  I verified that the correct DNS response is given (e2727.a.akamaiedge.net (23.0.59.48))   I briefly installed "Little Snitch" firewall, but uninstalled it.  Could there be some default blocking in the OS-level firewall leftover?
