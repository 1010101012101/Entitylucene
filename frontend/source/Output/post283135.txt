How to open a port in macOS Sierra 10.12.4 <body> I'm running macOS Sierra 10.12.4 and am trying to open a port (12345). I can't use the GUI firewall tool as it's app specific, not port specific.  I have tried the following this article, but it did not work. When I run codesudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf/code I get:  precodepfctl: Use of -f option, could result in flushing of rules present in the main ruleset added by the system at startup. See /etc/pf.conf for further details.  No ALTQ support in kernel ALTQ related functions disabled /code/pre  It may also help to note that in my firewall (GUI) options I have blocked pretty much all options as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jmQ0T.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer283137> You need to enable the firewall first.  In emSystem Preferences/em  emSecurity and Privacy/em under the emFirewall/em tab, tick the box to enable it (you will have to unlock first).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WrQcWm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternativily, you can do this via Terminal:  precode$ sudo pfctl -E /code/pre  Once you enable the firewall, you shouldn't get the codeNo ALTQ support in kernel/code error message.  <answer283150> The linked How-to is wrong!  You simply can't strongopen/strong a port in a firewall. You can block a port or not. By default pf is disabled and doesn't block anything. If you enable stealth mode in the Application Firewall, pf will be enabled via the com.apple/250.ApplicationFirewall anchor with a very limited set of rules:  precodescrub in all fragment reassemble block drop in inet proto icmp all icmp-type echoreq block drop in inet proto icmp all icmp-type echoreq block drop in inet6 proto ipv6-icmp all icmp6-type echoreq /code/pre  Except incoming IPv4/6 ICMP echo request, pf won't block anything. The default pf.conf doesn't contain any codeblock all .../code or codeallow all .../code rules.  To open a port on your host, you have to stronglaunch an app which opens a listening port/strong. Example nc:  precodenc -l 12345 /code/pre  After entering the command you will be asked to accept incoming network connections for nc by the Application Firewall.  To connect to nc listening at port 12345 from remote simply enter codenc hostname 12345/code on a second host (replace emhostname/em with the host name of the Mac running emnc/em).  You can check open ports from remote by entering codenmap hostname -Pn/code (if stealth mode is enabled).  <comment356919> "No ALTQ" is a limitation of the kernel. You will **always** get this message in macOS after enabling pf. The application firewall of the OP is already enabled or he wouldn't be able to see the firewall options. <comment356923> @klanomath - Did this change for Sierra?  This is how I fixed this issue once before....
