Snow Leopard Airport Join preferred device-based network <body> Is it possible to auto-join device-based networks on Snow Leopard (i.e. preferred)?  For example, by device-based network, I mean either a printer or an ad-hoc network.  <comment75305> The networks created by a standalone device, like a printer, are usually ad-hoc networks. What do you mean by auto-join? Do you want your computer to connect to it automatically when it is available? <comment75432> Yes, I want to automatically connect to it when it is available. <comment75493> I donâ€™t have a copy of Snow Leopard, but I just tried on Mountain Lion and it works. So, there is a strong possibility it will  work on Snow Leopard. <comment76051> I still can't get it to work in Snow Leopard, even if I manually add the network to my preferred list.
