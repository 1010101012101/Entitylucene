How do I backup photos *from* iCloud Photo Library <body> My Macbook is beginning to run out of space to "Keep originals" of the photos I have in the Photo Library, and I don't want the only copy of the photos to be in the cloud.  How can I create a hard copy of the library, probably on an external hard drive, after unchecking "Keep originals" on the Mac? I'm OK with running some backup procedure manually.  <answer199620> h2strong- If the photos you want are on iCloud:/strong/h2  Download the files as follows:    ol liLaunch the Photos app/li liGo to the Photos  Preferences /li liClick on the iCloud tab/li liClick on Download Originals to this Mac/li /ol  If you hard drive is full, then before doing this change the location of the iPhoto Library to an external drive.  Instructions for that are here: http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/01/25/how-to-safely-move-your-macs-iphoto-library-onto-an-external-drive  See below to get specific photos in the iPhoto library.   h2strong- If the photos you want are currently on your hard drive:/strong/h2  Copy or set your backup software to copy the following item:  /Users/your-username-here/Pictures/iPhoto Library  That should do it.    This is not a standard file, it is a package, so if you want to copy specific photos you can control click the file then choose "Show Package Contents".  You will then see a folder with various items including subfolders that contain your photos.  I believe the originals are stored in a folder called Master and are organized by date.  You can copy what you want from there.  Some back-up apps will even allow you to sync these subitems as opposed to the entire package.  <comment240367> That won't do the trick, because once the MacBook is only storing thumbnails then only the thumbnails will be backed up. What is needed is a way to copy the cloud's versions of the master files onto the backup disk -- I don't know of one. <comment240374> See edited answer.  Hopefully that helps.
