How do I increase default font size in Reminders under Mavericks? <body> Apparently is IS possible to change the size of the font in Reminders under Mavericks via a modification of "a text file inside the app package".   Can someone please post these instructions or point the way to finding them?  Thank you  <answer179895> I've had a look at it and at a glance (with a disassembler) there's no .plist (property list) file that could have anything that it directly would use to alter the size.  The size of the sidebar is inherited from what Apple call "Aqua", which is the default theme for OSX. Although they allow you to over-ride side-bars in most apps, they haven't allowed this in ALL apps, which is perplexing as I have the same issue!  I'd strongly suggest that you drop the resolution of your display. This will generally make the font (and everything else) across the system larger, depending of course what you set it to!  You can do this by:  ol liClick on ï£¿ (Apple, Top Left)/li liClick on "System Preferences"/li liClick on "Displays"/li /ol  codenote here that you might see:/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vffsP.png" alt="enter image description here"  codeThis is the system default setting which is generally acceptable with people who are neither nor nor far sighted/code To change this, carry on to 4 below.. If you don't just close the screen as you would any other screen.  ol start="4" liChange the setting shown above to "Scaled", which will present you something similar to:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U8hRk.png" alt="enter image description here"  `Mine is set to the highest possible setting on this MacBook (1440 x 900), so if I click on one setting lower, that is (1344 x 840), the above image would be larger, and as I click on the various ones going down, they get gradually more "zoomed" as to put it.  strongMAKE SURE YOU MAKE A NOTE OF THE SETTINGS IT WAS ALL INITIALLY ON!/strong  Without unorthodox system "hacks" there is no run of the mill way to change what you need changed sadly.  Hope this helps!  Adrian S
