Chrome doesnâ€™t start on Mac OS <body> I successfully installed Chrome on my Mac. However, when I'm trying to start it the browser icon just bounces in the dock once and disappears. Reinstalling, rebooting Mac and other options found on forums didn't help at all. How to fix this problem?  <answer271523> After a lot of investigation, I've finally found the solution (so I decided to put it as an answer here).  You need to strongopen Terminal/strong (emSpotlight search - type "terminal"/em) and strongrun the following command/strong:  precodesudo rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome /code/pre  Not sure if it affects Chrome user data in some way so use it at your own risk, but at least it helped me to run Chrome on macOS. Other approaches that seemed safer didn't work for me.
