Delete button doesn't take me back in Safari 5.2 on Lion <body> I am running the developer version of Safari 5.2 (7536.2.3) on Lion 10.7.3 on Alu unibody MacBook (early 2009). The problem is that the delete button does no longer work as a back button. The normal back button (in the top left corner of the window) and the Cmd+ left arrow work normally.  Is this just a bug in the dev version of Safari? Or something wrong with my browser/system? I'd be grateful for any hint...  <comment55204> Sorry, per the [faq#questions], questions about pre-release or beta software is not allowed here. Voting to close. <comment55284> Thanks for the info. And sorry, I will RTFM now.
