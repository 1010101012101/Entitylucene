Is it possible to restore a backup from a single disk on RAID1? <body> I want to setup a Mac Mini Server with the following configuration.  The Mac Mini server has 2*1TB HDDs.  I want to do the following:  ol liSetup the server/li liCreate a backup of the system on an external drive with Time Machine/li liCreate RAID1 with the two internal disks, according to this Link the disks should be empty then/li liThen I want to restore the backup created in step 2 on the RAID1/li liBackup all future data on the RAID1 system on the external drive /li /ol  The RAID1 should give us the reliability we need, while the backups should ensure data security. However I am not 100% sure whether I can restore the backup made in step 2 on a RAID1 system. I assume it makes no difference as a RAID1 should be handled like a single disk by the OS.  Is it possible to restore a backup from a single disk on RAID1?  <answer139291> I strongbelieve/strong it can be done but you lose the recovery partition and depending on your IT skills and willingness to start from scratch if the O/S gets hosed it might be a viable opportunity.  Note that I have not done this with Mavericks or Time Machine.  You need to boot from an O/S install disk. you can make one out of an 8GB flash drive with the Mavericks installer app and a number of freely available tools. Once you have booted from the O/S installer flash drive, bring up disk utility and wipe the drives of all partitions. Delete them. Then under the RAID tab make a RAID out of those two disks and partition as you want. Probably just best to stick with one partition unless you have a specific need for more than one.  Once that is done you can install the o/s on the RAID and restore your apps/files/settings from the external disk.  Note that I restored with a disk image using Carbon Copy Cloner from within disk utility, worked great but on an earlier O/S. So feedback from other folks would be good before committing to this procedure.  <comment164192> It is not possible, since the the recovery partition shipped with MacOS does not work with RAID1. At least I wasn't able to restore the backup on the RAID. <comment164519> I just reinstalled the system from scratch, created the RAID like Apple describes it in the documentation. The recovery partition is gone but I created one on the external backup disk. Works like a charm now.
