Running Parallels and VirtualBox for Docker in OS X? <body> I use Parallels for Windows while VirtualBox/Kinematic (Beta) for Docker in OS X -- but haven't yet tested at the same time because of possible problems such as here, dated to 2013 so many problems may be fixed. So what is the status of VM/Docker and Parallels and is it possible to run them at the same time and if yes, how in OS X? Precautions?  <comment336160> Please add the system and Parallels version <comment336161> Parallels claims it works: http://kb.parallels.com/en/123356
