Can I copy SD cards using an iPod touch? <body> I'd like to backup photos taken on my dSLR camera on SD cards. Can I use a USB adapter to copy an SD card into the iPod's local memory, then attach a different SD card and copy the files to that?  <answer43769> Probably not, as the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit is officially not supported on iPhone or iPod touch; and that would just give you the physical connection of your SD card to the iPod touch.   To have direct access to the file-system of your SD-card you need a jailbreak. There is a slight chance you may get the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit working on a jailbroken iPod touch:  Check out iConnectionKit and this YouTube video.

I have used usb card readers plugged into one end &amp; various other usb devices plugged into the other &amp; it has always worked.  Hope this helps.
