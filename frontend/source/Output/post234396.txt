What does it mean when iMessage suddenly stops saying "Delivered"? <body> I was texting my friend and everything was okay until I took a few minutes to reply to her message and my text suddenly does not say "Delivered" under it. I'm under Wi-Fi and she possibly was too so what could've happened? Was it me or her?  <answer234404> iMessage will not return a "delivered" message if the message was not delivered to the user.  Here are some situations of iMessage returning different statuses:  strongNot delivered/strong (usually accompanied with a red exclamation): the message could not be sent from your phone due to your network connection  strong(no message)/strong: the message was successfully sent from your phone, but not delivered to the recipient due to the recipient's network connection   strongdelivered/strong: the message was successfully sent from your phone emand/em delivered to the recipient.  <comment286599> Hi Stephanie. Welcome to Ask Different. As the answer below states, your phone will not say "delivered" unless it was successfully delivered. Try force-closing the Messages app and reopening.
