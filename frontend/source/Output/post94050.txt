Is Mac Mini's Fusion drive useful if I mostly use windows 8 through Bootcamp? <body> I am considering of buying a Mac Mini with a 1TB Fusion Drive. However I will rarely use OSX (except for iPhone application development) and will mostly be running Windows 8 through Bootcamp. In this setup, is it worth for me to spend extra 250$ on the Fusion Drive?  <answer94051> My understanding is if you want to use Bootcamp, you'll have each drive formatted and available to the software as a two-drive system and not as a one drive - fused hybrid item.  ul liBoot Camp 5: Frequently asked questions - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639/li /ul  Out of the box, the BootCamp software will see if you have a CoreStorage fusion drive and just put the Windows partition on the spinning HD. There, it won't even get to see the SSD nor likely any of the data that exists on a core storage volume (which is a mix of files stored on the SSD and on the HDD).  I'd still get the fusion drive since you can always experiment with the BootCamp default situation, experiment with virtualization, and decide to partition both drives to be stand-alone and run BootCamp to install Windows on the SSD itself. Worst case, you don't like the experience and take advantage of Apple's 14 day return policy to get a different Mac if you don't like your Mini once you've tried it for a week or so.  hr  Here's what you'll likely see when you get your Mac. The SSD will be codedisk0/code and the DHH will be codedisk1/code and the combination of disk0s2 and disk1s2 will be the raw space that fuses into Macintosh HD to be a logical:  precodeMacMini:~ me$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         121.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3  /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         999.4 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3 /code/pre  In system profiler under storage, you'll see something similar to this:  precodeMacintosh HD:    Available:    1 TB (1,000,499,220,480 bytes)   Capacity: 1.11 TB (1,111,826,497,536 bytes)   Mount Point:  /   File System:  Journaled HFS+   Writable: Yes   Ignore Ownership: No   BSD Name: disk2   Volume UUID:  32F084C9-A737-34BE-9567-165721D02C07   Logical Volume:   Revertible:   No   Encrypted:    No   LV UUID:  CDBF5035-78F6-4302-B90E-2B9034324A26   Logical Volume Group:   Name: Macintosh HD   Size: 1.12 TB (1,120,333,979,648 bytes)   Free Space:   115 KB (114,688 bytes)   LVG UUID: D0EFA715-18BE-408E-8149-838206F04AFB   Physical Volumes: disk0s2:   Media Name:   APPLE SSD SM128E Media   Size: 120.99 GB (120,988,852,224 bytes)   Medium Type:  SSD   Protocol: SATA   Internal: Yes   Partition Map Type:   GPT (GUID Partition Table)   Status:   Online   S.M.A.R.T.

So if I have a two-drive setup with Windows residing on HDD, will SSD not be used in any way when I run Windows? <comment110246> Windows will see two drives. The entire SSD will be a core storage volume with content it can't read. The half of the HDD will be it's boot partition, the other half will be a core storage volume with content it can't read. Only if you deleted the two core storage partitions that Apple places on both drives when they ship will windows have the ability to write to the SSD.
