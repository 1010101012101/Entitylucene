How to restore a removed /bin/sh file? <body> I have followed a guide online which requested me to run this command:  precodesudo cp /opt/local/bin/node /bin/sh /code/pre  It was a guide for fixing LESS. Instead of fixing it, it only made it worse. I have lost the file.  Is there any way to recover/refetch this file, or could someone upload their codesh/code file for me?  <answer143210> Run this command to copy /bin/sh from the BaseSystem.dmg on the Recovery HD:  precodediskutil mount Recovery\ HD &amp;&amp;     hdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg &amp;&amp;     sudo cp -p /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/bin/sh /bin/sh /code/pre  Also see How can I get back a system file after deleting it from my Mac?  <answer148931> code/bin/sh/code is actually a lot easier to fix if you have read through something like emLinux from Scratch/em as it is usually a symlink on other UNIXes, pointing to a shell, usually code/bin/bash/code, and occasionally code/bin/dash/code.  The quick and fix:  precodesudo ln -sf bash /bin/sh /code/pre  as it will create a symlink pointing from code/bin/sh/code to code/bin/bash/code just like every other UNIX and Linux distribution. You can of course symlink it to any other Bourne-compatible shells you would like to use, including that latest codebash-4.3/code or even Debian's codedash/code.  <comment168677> To request someone to upload their `sh` for you is as risky as it was to follow the receipe you did. This is **trust at random** :).
