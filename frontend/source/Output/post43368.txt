video resolution of iMovie app export in iPhone 4S <body> What are the export resolutions of a video shot on iPhone 4S and exported from iMovie app (after editing)? Also, is there a way I can export original resolution, (1080p) video to youtube from within the iPhone app of iMovie.   <answer43433> My understanding is that the new Garageband (iOS 5.1) supports 1080p video.  <comment73701> Means I have to buy another app and it cannot be done through iMovie itself? <comment73851> No. You should be able to export 1080p directly from iMovie.
