Can I delete text messages with one swipe like mail messages on iPhone? <body> I would like to be able to swipe completely to left and get my text messages deleted similarly to email messages. I can swipe left and the "delete" option appears, but it's another click. Is this possible? Thanks  <answer190730> Currently on the iOS 8 app, this is not an available feature.  <comment226517> That feature is gone in iOS 7 itself.. In iOS 8 you can't do that... http://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Text-Messages-From-an-iPhone <comment226669> Thanks, thought as much. Pity though.
