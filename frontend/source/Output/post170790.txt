Are all USB numeric keypads OSX comatible? <body> My office uses the small Apple bluetooth keyboards.  I have a user who is requesting a numeric keypad.  Apple sells a Belkin wireless keypad on their website, but it has terrible reviews and it isnt cheap.    There are countless USB numeric keypads that are a fraction of the price, all designed for Windows.    If I buy one of the USB ones, it should work on a Mac, right?  It is just a USB keyboard...  <answer170791> Yes, if it's just a normal keyboard input device, which it should be.br I have one which doesn't say it's specifically for OS X, but works fineâ€”it's just a keyboard.  <comment200857> Thats what I thought, but Im new to supporting Apple products and I wasnt 100% sure... <comment200858> @Keltari Unless it's something special, it should work fine. It's impossible to know without testing the specific device, but all the ones I've seen (including the one I have) work fine as they are just a keyboard with a limited set of buttons. <comment200875> good enough for me.  worst case, i can just return it.
