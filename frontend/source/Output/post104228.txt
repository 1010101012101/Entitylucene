Error when installing matplotlib <body> I tried to install matplotlib on OS X Lion with the codepip install/code command, but I get the following error:   precodeerror: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1 /code/pre  Does anyone have a solution?   <answer241865> matplotlib is part of the python 2.7 installed with El Capitan, no need to install it.  <comment122690> Have you installed Xcode and its command line tools? However even with this I suspect this is a complex install due to the GUI libraries which can be used  and I would use a package manager like macports or homebrew <comment122696> I've installed Xcode but what do you mean with the command line tool ? I use brew as a package manager. <comment122698> Xcode just installs the GUI to run C compilers from the command line you need the extra. If you use brew then install matplotlib via it as it solved the issues you are having <comment122702> `brew install matplotlib` gives `Error: No available formula for matplotlib` <comment122703> If that's the question I've got gcc installed on my machine. <comment122711> Macports port just works. I use macports but try to mention all package managers, looks like here they are not equal (this seems to be for python based stuff. For brew and matplotlib see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12363557/matplotlib-install-failure-on-mac-osx-10-8-mountain-lion and other questions <comment297278> OP is using Lion.
