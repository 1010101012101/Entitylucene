Bluetooth timeout on Mac Mini <body> I was wondering if there is any way to keep bluetooth peripherals active for a set amount of time. For example the connection to a keyboard I have just bought is lost after about 10 seconds of inactivity and always misses the first couple of keystrokes when reconnecting. Similar to a bluetooth mouse I have as well, takes a second or two to get it going after it has been motionless for 30 seconds or so. Is there a timeout that I can alter?  It's running Mavericks, keyboard and mouse are third party.  <comment163599> Hi, lets us work on this. Why do you think it is your Mac disconnecting the BT?  If you know how to use the Console look in to it to see who)by whom or how BT is disconnected. <comment163603> ok, read this and see if it helps you http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/110235/46541 <comment163648> Hello, I'm not entirely sure that it's the mac but it does seem to happen with every peripheral. They do reconnect (so I don't think the linked article is relevant) but it's never instant, so as I say I miss the first couple of key strokes or have to waggle the mouse around. I could live with that if the 'timeout' was say 2 minutes or so but at the moment it's around 10 seconds.  I'm happy to have a go on the Console, what should I be looking for?
