Macbook Pro Screen Does Not Light Up <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015); Model MF839. It's been working great so far but recently, I have been getting issues where the screen will go dark while using all of a sudden. In the beginning, it would light back up after a few seconds but lately it's been getting worse. It goes dark and I have to try to adjust the screen angle to try to get it to a working position. I have googled the solution to this problem but almost all of them come down to resetting the PRAM and the SMC, I have tried both it worked great for a week or so until I am back to the original problem. Can anyone tell if he's been having the same issue as well or if he's been able to resolve it?
