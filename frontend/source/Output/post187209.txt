Command line to disconnect or connect 802.1x authentication <body> I have been searching for a terminal command line to disconnect or connect 802.1x authentication, but not the network interface. I was searching some help pages and it showed command lines to export and import 802.1x settings/certificates but not disconnecting and connecting.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NhI9P.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer225604> h3Disconnecting from WiFi Networks/h3  precodesudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport sudo airport --disassociate /code/pre  hr  Run these commands in Terminal. Your WiFi will disconnect, while the AirPort Network Interface remains enabled.  <answer287508> This button is tied to the eapolclient. When it's connected, you can disconnect it by killing the eapolclient process:  precode$ ps ax | grep eapol 83601   ??  Ss     0:00.05 /System/Library/SystemConfiguration/EAPOLController.bundle/Contents/Resources/eapolclient -i en0 $ sudo kill 83601 /code/pre  When I do this the GUI button switches to show it's disconnected. The bad news is, I don't know how you can start it again :(  Perhaps you can achieve the same by turning the interface off/on:  precode sudo ifconfig &lt;interface&gt; down  sudo ifconfig &lt;interface&gt; up /code/pre
