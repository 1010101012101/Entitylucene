web sharing for vhosts? <body> I'd like to be able to share websites I'm developing with other users in my network using Web Sharing. I don't develop in my 'Sites' folder though, I have a separate folder for all my projects.  (Note: web sharing is working generally. If I visit codehttp://[my-local-ip-address]/~[myusername]/code it shows the default local Site that I never touch.)  e.g. I use apache's httpd-vhosts.conf file and /etc/hosts to setup local domains that can be accessed by me like so:  codehttp://mytestsite/code  So.. can I configure OS X Lion &amp; apache to allow other to see them around the LAN like this?  codehttp://[my-local-ip-address]/~mytestsite/code  Thanks! Ben  <answer53087> Yes, you can configure Mac OS X 10.7, aka Lion, to serve multiple web sites using URLs like codehttp://[my-local-ip-address]/~mytestsite/code.  The format of URL you suggest can be achieved by creating a new user for each site, and storing the web pages in that user's Sites folder.  Alternatively, you could create subfolders within your site's folder:  ul licodehttp://[my-local-ip-address]/~[myusername]/site1/code/li licodehttp://[my-local-ip-address]/~[myusername]/site2/code/li licodehttp://[my-local-ip-address]/~[myusername]/site3/code/li /ul  Going another step further, you can customise the Apache httpd 2 configuration files at code/etc/apache2/users/[myusername]/code to tweak the set up to your exact needs.  <answer53163> If you have all of the projects in a single folder just set Apache's codeDocumentRoot/code in code/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code to directory.  Or you can just put the project folders in code/Library/WebServer/Documents/code.
