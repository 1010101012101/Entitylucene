Macbook pro wifi slow <body> I have MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) with both macos and windows(bootcamp) installed. Try to connect to my home router (zyhel keenatics ultra II, pretty standard settings),  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015), 5GHz network. Actually it is the only 5GHz network available. Rebooting to windows, connect, navigate to speedtest.net - get 100Mbps - limited by my inet provider. The same problem with both El Capitan and Sierra Rebooting to macos, connect, speedtest - 2Mbps.
