Cannot install applications: error code -60008 <body> I am trying to install new applications, but I keep getting this error message from the "Copy" application:     The operation canâ€™t be completed because an unexpected error occurredbr   (error code -60008).   The applications I am trying to install are:     ul ligit from git-2.2.1-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/li liSourceTree from SourceTree_2.0.5.2.dmg/li /ul  The message is given after I drag the application on the destination directory, and after being asked if I want it to replace the old one.   In the past I had no problems with them.   <answer178713> After many attempts, the only way I could install these applications has been through a manual copy from the command line:    precodesudo hdiutil attach ./SourceTree_2.0.5.2.dmg sudo cp -r /Volumes/SourceTree/SourceTree.app /Applications/ /code/pre  <comment211699> For SourceTree try Check for Updates... in its menu <comment211722> @Mark - I cannot do it any longer. SourceTree got corrupted trying to install the new version... <comment211724> Googling goves thios http://lists.apple.com/archives/Installer-dev/2008/Mar/msg00022.html - so I think you need to delete all of SourceTree and that might include ~/Library/Application Support/SourceTree - Also Sourcetree includes git (/Applications/SourceTree.app/Contents/Resources/git_local/bin/git) so you don't need the separate install unless you want command line - And which of the 2 installs you have gives the error? <comment211737> even after deleting /Application/SourceTree.app ? <comment212121> @Mark - Yes. I found no other way...
