Entering hibernate mode after delay upon going to sleep mode doesn't work when using power supply <body> I've successfully set the MAC to enter hibernate mode after 1 minute delay upon going to sleep mode but it works only on battery power. When using power supply, the computer stays in sleep mode after 1 minute. How to achieve the same results using power supply?  commands I've used:  precodesudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3 sudo pmset -a standbydelay 60 /code/pre  pmset -g gives me these results:  precodestandbydelay         60  standby              1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  powernap             0  gpuswitch            2  disksleep            10  sleep                1  autopoweroffdelay    28800  hibernatemode        3  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         2  tcpkeepalive         1  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  I am using macOS Sierra Version 10.12.5 on MacBook Pro  <answer291060> Oh maybe you should also set autopoweroffdelay to 60.  According to Apple's KB (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201635), it said: "OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 supplemental update 2.0 introduced a feature that lets your Mac enter safe sleep after four hours of being connected to AC power."  So it's clear now:  "standby" only takes effect when the computer using BATTERY.   "autopoweroff" only takes effect when the computer is CONNECTED TO AC POWER.  So you should also use this command:  precodesudo pmset -a autopoweroffdelay 60 /code/pre  It should work now, hope this helps you.  <comment372044> Yup that seemed to work. Also for reference it appears that sometime on or after yosemite the default autopoweroffdelay was changed from 14400 (seconds) to 28800.
