Why is Top Left Corner of the display blank when using Final Cut Pro? <body> I noticed this strange problem when when I was using Final Cut Pro. The top left corner of the display does not appear. The same can be seen on the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oPrvW.png" alt="enter image description here"  I left it for a while and when checked, It seemed to have turned black.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfN8c.png" alt="enter image description here"  This has happened over a few times to me in the past only when starting to use FCP.  h2Hardware and Software/h2  ul liMBP 13 inch, Late 2011 - OS X Mavericks 10.9.4 /li liFinal Cut Pro 10.0.8/li /ul  h2Question/h2  ol liWhat was the reason this could have occurred?/li liIs there anyway to solve this without having to "reboot"?/li /ol  <answer157316> Updating Final Cut Pro from 10.0.8 to 10.1.2 has solved this problem.
