Bash looping directories <body> My simple task is to create within the workdir up to max separate dirs   ol licopy within it some files from the template dir (so every new dir is replicas and the difference only within it names defined from i) /li licreate new txt file within each of the new dir with some text:  precodehome=/projects/clouddyn/md_bench/for_server/MD_bench template=$home/template  cd $home min=1 max=3  for i in $(eval echo "{$min..$max}") do     mkdir "sim_$i"     sim=$(basename "sim_$i")     pushd $sim     cp $template/*.* $sim     prinf "This is $i dir" &gt; ./$sim/file_$i.txt     popd done /code/pre/li /ol  Unfortunately the new dirs are created but files didn't copy  Thanks for the help!  <answer230652> There are several things in your script which can make it go wrong:  precode#!/bin/bash home=/projects/clouddyn/md_bench/for_server/MD_bench  # home is a bad choice, because $HOME has a special meaning and it's # confusing to have both $HOME and $home. But it doesn't make the script fail  template=$home/template  cd $home min=1 max=3  # for i in $(eval echo "{$min..$max}") # this can be replaced by the easier to read for i in {$min..$max} do     mkdir "sim_$i"      # sim=$(basename "sim_$i")     # basename strips the path part, but "sim_$i" doesn't even have a path     # so basically this just assigned "sim_$i" to $sim and can be replaced by     sim="sim_$i"     # Ideally this assignment would be the first statement after 'do' so      # it could be used already in 'mkdir'      # pushd $sim     # cp $template/*.* $sim     # Two problems here:     # - 'pushd' already changes into $sim, so when 'cp' is called there is     #   no $sim directory to copy into (as you are already in it)     # - '$template/*.*' only matches files with a dot in the name, which may     #   or may not be what you want     # As there is no need to 'cd' into a directory to copy files into it I     # would just use     cp $template/* $sim/      # prinf "This is $i dir" &gt; ./$sim/file_$i.txt     # You probably meant 'printf' here. Also this line has the same problem     # as the 'cp' above (you are already in $sim)     printf "This is $i dir" &gt; $sim/file_$i.txt      # popd     # Not needed any longer done /code/pre
