Remove Apple Support Communities account or change nickname <body> I accidently created an account in the codeApple Support Communities/code with the wrong nickname because I thought I was logged in within another Apple ID. I always read that the only way is to create a new Apple ID but that is not possible because the iOS developer program is active on this ID. Has anyone be able to change his nickname or remove the forum account?
