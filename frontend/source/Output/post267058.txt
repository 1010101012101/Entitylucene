Magic trackpad starts pairing but does not complete succesfully with one Macbook <body> I have two Macbook pro retina's:    ul liMbPro 15" retina late 2015 El Capitan/li liMbPro 15" retina mid 2012 El Capitan/li /ul  The first one is able to pair with the codeMagic Trackpad/code (emnot/em the "2" - instead the older version).  But the 2012 one has the following behavior:  ul liinitially detects the trackpad -including showing the serial #/li libut then cannot complete the pairing - and I'm back to square one./li /ul  The initial detection of the trackpad happened several times.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HyDI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But usually I do not even get that far: the trackpad is simply not detected.  There is obviously no problem with signal or batteries (new): the trackpad works all day on the other MBPro.  What should I look for as potential culprits and fixes?  <answer267059> Just found a related question and answer: apparently the trackpad can only be paired with one mac at a time - even if the other one were powered off (as is the case here)  How can I pair my Magic Trackpad with multiple Macs?
