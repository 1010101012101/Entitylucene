macbook - low power from the command line <body> I often (for example on the train) want to put my macbook into a state that will maximise the amount of time I have before the battery runs out - so far example I'll switch off the bluetooth, then switch off the wifi, then alter the brightness - my question is, can I do all of this from the command line? Then I run some nice little script...   <answer40138> You can, but you will need some extra utilities:  strongbrightness/strong - you can download the program at                 http://dev.sabi.net/svn/dev/trunk/LocationDo/brightness.c and compile it using the command:  codegcc -std=c99 -o brightness brightness.c -framework IOKit -framework ApplicationServices/code  Or you can just download it from my server at http://attic.luo.ma/brightness.bz2  Once you have it, codebrightness 0.01/code will lower the brightness as much as possible  strongBluetooth/strong - The command you want is codeblueutil/code which you can find here https://github.com/toy/blueutil. I have a compiled version of that available at http://attic.luo.ma/blueutil2.bz2. I also have another, older version of a program by the same name which you can download from http://attic.luo.ma/blueutil.bz2.  Whichever program you use, the code-h/code flag will explain how to use it.  strongWi-Fi/strong - You can turn AirPort power on or off using:  codenetworksetup -setairportpower &lt;device name&gt; &lt;on off&gt;/code  where code&lt;device name&gt;/code is probably either en0 or en1  You can find out which it is using   codenetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder | egrep "Wi-Fi, Device"/code  For my MacBook Air (which uses en0), the command to turn it off is:  codenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off/code  h3More Settings/h3  Be sure that you have changed the Energy Settings in System Preferences too, but you can also set them using:  codesudo pmset -b sleep 10/code  to tell the computer to sleep after 10 minutes when on battery, and/or:  codesudo pmset -b displaysleep 5/code  to tell the computer emdisplay/em to sleep after 5 minutes, when on battery (the -b flag indicates battery).  codepmset -g/code  will show you your current settings.  <comment45383> Can you provide a more complete list of the things you want to accomplish? You've got Bluetooth, WiFi, and brightness; is there anything else you want to do? <comment45385> Those are the only things I do at the moment - if someone suggests something else that can be done from the command line that would help save power (I assume one can probably throttle the processor a little as well) then I'm all ears... <comment45389> p.s - the newer version of `blueutil` can be installed from Homebrew using `brew install --HEAD blueutil`
