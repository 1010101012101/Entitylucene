Mac OS X Terminal mouse reporting <body> I don't know why this is bothering me but I've been pressing kbdCmd-R/kbd to refresh my browser and today I mistakenly pressed this combination while using the terminal.  I came across an option known as "Mouse Reporting". What is it? Is it on by default in OS X? How do I reset the terminal to defaults (including mouse reporting)?  <answer233697> To my knowledge it is turned off by default. However, all it allows is for applications run in the Terminal to see the position of your mouse cursor. This could be useful for things like games where you use your mouse. So in most cases, it simply does not matter.  To turn off Mouse Reporting, just press kbdCmd-R/kbd again.  However, if you really want to reset your Terminal preferences:   ul liFirst quit the Terminal, then open the Finder./li liPress kbdCmd-Shift-G/kbd and type code~/Library/code into the bar that appears/li liPress go./li liFind the Preferences folder, then find the file called codecom.apple.Terminal.plist/code./li liDrag it into the trash, then empty the trash./li /ul  Your terminal should be back to factory settings.
