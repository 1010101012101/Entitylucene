Bell causes entire screen to flash white <body> I have an old-ish iMac where the sound has stopped working:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CBJN.png" alt="enter image description here"  which I'm not really too fussed about - it doesn't get used for a whole lot of stuff.  The only really annoying part is that it seems like every time the OS wants to play a bell, it sees that there's no sound available so it flashes the entire screen white.  I've checked another SE post which recommended checking "Accessibility  Audio  Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs" and trying to enable then disable it - done that, and had no luck. I've also removed code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist/code and restarted, that hasn't helped either.  As another answer on the other post suggested, I've also tried running codesudo killall coreaudiod/code with no joy.  Does anyone else have any idea how I can get rid of the white flash?  <answer223596> Since I don't have a broken audio card and VMs apparently don't work with a virtual sound device (pun not intended but it got one - maybe I made a mistake installing Soundflower) I can't really prove it, but the following should work:  ul liDownload Soundflower 2.0b2 (for 10.8, 10.9, 10.10)/li lior download Soundflower 1.6.3 (tested with 10.7)/li lior download and compile the Soundflower sources/li liInstall Soundflower and reboot your Mac/li liSet the Soundflower device as default audio output for alerts/sound effects with the Audio-MIDI-Setup tool (found in /Applications/Utilities).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OE0qT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  <comment271113> Awesome, that's sorted it :) Still no sound, which is totally fine, but no more annoying screen flash either. I can't award the bounty for 19 hours, so when that time's up, it's all yours <comment271114> @Joe ;-)  To get the sound working again you have to add a second question. If the the audio chip isn't blown it should be possible. Please add your [iMac model](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/index-imac.html) and the version of your current OS X. <comment271117> Don't worry - not worth the effort for the use it gets. It was just infuriating to have it flashing every time I clicked somewhere I shouldn't :P
