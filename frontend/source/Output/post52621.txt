How to limit search only to file name instead the content of files? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Searching by file name (as opposed to name and contents) in Lion       I have a "server" with OS X Lion and a shared hard disk, and some clients with various version of OS X (10.4 to 10.7).   When a client search for a file, I would like to limit the search to the strongfile name/strong and strongnot the content/strong of the files.   Is there a way to do this?  <answer52649> When you're in the Finder, hit Command + F. Notice under the Search: bar there's some options. Use the pulldown to select Name. Then set the next to Matches, Contains... and type in your search string.
