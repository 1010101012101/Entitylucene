Simple 'drag and drop style' video compressor <body> Is there any app really simple to compress videos on Mac?  Something like JPEGmini for videos (do not resize, just reduce file size).  I just know Handbrake, but it is not the most simple solution.  <answer217259> I quite like MPEG Streamclip. I use it quite often and while it offers most of the options of HandBreak (and some it doesn't), it can be a drag-and drop video compressor if your want.   <answer217324> It is not free, but Apple itself has an app called Compressor.  You can see its information here: Compressor  Usually it is used together with Final Cut Pro, but can as well be used standalone.  <answer217364> I like Macroplant's Adapter. It has a list of presets and is really easy to use.
