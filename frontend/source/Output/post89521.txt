"Home" and "End" HotKeys in Vim INSERT Mode with MacBook Pro <body> I am pretty new to Vim and to Mac, I have a MacBook Pro with Retina Display running OS X 10.8.3, which does NOT have native kbdHome/kbd, kbdEnd/kbd, kbdPageUp/kbd and kbdPageDown/kbd keys.  I know the kbdFn/kbd + kbdarrow keys/kbd can work in some applications. Also in bash, I can use kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdA/kbd go to the beginning of the command line I am typing and kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdE/kbd go to the end.  But in Vim with INSERT/edit Mode, all these works differently. I don't want to always switch to the Normal Mode using kbd0/kbd and kbd$/kbd or kbdI/kbd and kbdA/kbd. (Or, is this the best way?)  So can anyone show me some tricks to map some hotkeys that can works conveniently? Or some other solutions? ( But please without MacVim, I want to try native Vim for a while first:) )?  Any other tips for kbdHome/kbd, kbdEnd/kbd, kbdPageUp/kbd and kbdPageDown/kbd functions under the Mac also welcome.  <answer97016> Vim allows you to map any key sequence to other key sequence using code:map/code command. There are several types of this command, that can be used to create shortcuts only for some vim modes. Check out this page and/or code:help map/code command inside vim for details.  About your questions there are two ways in vim to implement kbdHome/kbd behaviour:  ul likbd0/kbd (zero) to go to the very first column/li likbd^/kbd to go to the column with the first non-whitespace character on a given line/li /ul  For kbdEnd/kbd you can use kbd$/kbd. For kbdPageUp/kbd and kbdPageDown/kbd you can use kbdCtrl+F/kbd and kbdCtrl+B/kbd respectively.  This keys only work in command mode, but you can remap it to use in insert mode with code:imap/code ('i' here is for insert-mode) and kbdCtrl+F/kbd. For example, to map kbdCtrl+A/kbd to act as kbd0/kbd use this command:  precode:imap &lt;C-a&gt; &lt;C-o&gt;0 /code/pre  It's a very standard vim command and must work like a charm in console vim, gvim, mvim etc.  <answer120092> Just one tip. By default bash runs in "emacs mode". You can change it to "vi mode". Bash uses the readline package to edit your command line, for more details read the "READLINE" section of the bash man page.   In short you can redefine a lot of the key bindings in a file called .inputrc which should live in your home folder.  readline is also used by a number of other utilities and places such as the interactive python shell.  <answer266485> Go to Terminal - Preferences - Profiles - Keyboard and add:  Key: ↖ Action: \033OH  Key: ↗ Action: \033OF
