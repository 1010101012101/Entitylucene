iPhone 4 keeps losing contacts <body> My iPhone 4 keeps losing contacts under various conditions: first after an app crash followed by a manual reboot; all the other times after the battery becomes empty.  <answer111165> What proved helpful in my situation was replacing the battery (which was nearly 3 years old) with a new one. Since then I haven't reached a zero battery in several weeks, but after all it stopped the lost contacts problem from reappearing since the replacement.
