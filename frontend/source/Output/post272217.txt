launchd how to give special command at program stop? <body> I am using launchd to run some docker containers at boot with codedocker-compose/code. I am used to systemd on ubuntu which has both codeExecStart/code and codeExecStop/code directives...  If I do not bring the containers down with codedocker-compose down/code then I have to do some cleanup manually before I can relaunch them, but as far as I can see, launchd has no way to issue a custom command at stop time. Did I miss something?  How can I give a custom command when calling codelaunchctl stop .../code?
