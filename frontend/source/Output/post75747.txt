Why is my Mac's CPU throttled? (Turbo Boost Ratio) <body> AnandTech has a instructionssup1/sup on how you can check the strongTurbo Ratios/strong for the Mac's CPU. Since they are logged, the information is very easy to find.     In Mountain Lion you can do this the following way:      ol   liOpen code/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/code/li   liOpen the codesystem.log/code on the left side./li   liSearch for entries containing codeTurbo Ratios/code/li   /ol   What you'll find is something like this:  precodeDec 16 20:11:47 localhost kernel[0]: AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement: Turbo Ratios 0035 /code/pre  And this means:     The line above lists turbo ratios as strong0035/strong. The four digit number is the strongturbo ratio for the active cores/strong   (strong4C/3C/2C/1C/strong). Depending on the active cores, the clock speed   can vary. Each number is stronghexadecimal/strong.      The first two numbers are 0s because the CPU doesn't have more than   two cores and thus doesn't support any turbo ratios when 4 or 3 cores   are active (2012 Macbook Air, i5-3427U). The third number tells us the   maximum turbo boost with two cores active: 3. That's 3 bins, where   each bin is 100MHz, or 300MHz above the stock 1.8GHz operating   frequency (strong2.1GHz/strong).      The fourth number gives us max turbo when only a single core is   active: 5. Five bins is 500MHz, which on top of the 1.8GHz base   frequency gives us strong2.3GHz/strong.      sup(Edited text from AnandTech to fit my CPU.)/sup   However, according to notebookcheck.netsup2/sup the Turbo Ratio should be strong008A/strong or strong1.8GHz/2.6GHz/2.8GHz/strong. This would be in line with Apple's advertisementsup3/sup for the 2012 13" Macbook Air:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0w3qa.png" alt="enter image description here"  This raises the obvious question: strongWhy is my Mac's CPU throttled?/strong  ul liI wish I were able to use the strongMSR tools/strong to get more information about the clock speeds, but for them to work I need to boot in 32-bit kernel mode which is not available in Mountain Lion anymore./li listrongMacCPUID/strongsup4/sup is an official tool by Intel which you can use to calculate the current CPU clock. The current version 2.1 has been released on the 10/31/2012 but still seems buggy. No matter how I stress my CPU, it always calculates that the clock is at a constant 2.3 GHz./li /ul  <answer75812> So, I ran some strongCinebench R11.5/strong benchmarks to get more information about the strongsingle threaded/strong performance of my i5-3427Usup1/sup (1.8-2.8 GHz) CPU:     1 thread &#x2192; 1.10   I also contacted the author of the linked article by AnandTech - @anandshimpisup2/sup.  Anand Lal Shimpi was so kind to send me a benchark chart which compared the single threaded performance of the 2011 13" Macbook Airs with the 2012 13" Macbook Airs using Cinebench R11.5.  Into this picture, I have added information about the maximum single threaded CPU clocks along with a comparison of the measured performance such as Anand Lal Shimpi has suggested.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKtHI.png" alt="enter image description here"br sup[image source]/sup  In this info graphic I am comparing specifically:     ul   li2011 13" Macbook Air, i5-2557M 1.7GHz/2.4GHz/strong2.7GHz/strong/li   li2012 13" Macbook Air, i5-3427U 1.8GHz/2.6GHz/strong2.8GHz/strong/li   /ul   As you can see, the single threaded clock of the 2012 model is strong3.7%/strong increased in turbo boost mode.  However, the benchmark score saw a strong9.9%/strong increase which is not simply due to the higher clock, but also due to the more efficient Ivy Bridge architecture which is about 5-15% fastersup3/sup than Sandy Bridge.   In sum, the benchmark scores are emas expected/em whereas the codeTurbo Ratios/code log entries are not. Anand Lal Shimpi had "figured it was a bug, submitted it to Apple back in July"sup4/sup.  <comment87931> I originally started becoming skeptical about the CPU clock speeds in my Macbook Air when I noticed that Virtual Machines I use never reported clock speeds higher than 2.3 GHz. My findings in `system.log` surprised me because the Macbook Air runs very cool under normal use which is why I did not expect CPU throttling at all. Also, AnandTech has reported that the 2011 Macbook Airs were not throttled. In case you have access to a 2012 Macbook Air could you please report if you see the same? <comment87933> Same machine, same turbo ratio... <comment87934> @cablesm Thanks for letting me know. I also found out that user URI on superuser is experiencing this: http://superuser.com/q/517476/182260 <comment87954> If only Intel released a Turbo Boost monitor or the API for OS X... - http://stackoverflow.com/q/13996083/475228 - also it's not clear that anything is wrong - just because you haven't seen conditions where the max boost is enabled doesn't mean it won't under some light load situations. <comment87962> @bmike It would be great to monitor the turbo boost feature under OS X. I ran the Cinebench R11.5 benchmark to get a broader picture of what's going on: 4 threads-2.47, 1 thread-1.10. Anyway, if the Turbo Ratio digits for `AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement` work as described by AnandTech then the max Turbo boost is not enabled yet.
