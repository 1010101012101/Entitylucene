How to change a search direction in terminal <body> I'm under OS X El Capitan 10.11.1. When I try to search in terminal text by kbdcmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd it starts to search from the beginning rather than from the end backwards as it was in terminal on Ubuntu.    So how can I change the search direction to start a search from the end in terminal?  <answer231440> ul lipress kbdCmd-F/kbd/li lito search backward press kbdShift-Enter/kbd/li /ul  <comment282643> Maybe not a solution, but just like with most applications, `Cmd+G` repeats  last search and `Cmd+Shift+G` does the same thing, but in the other direction. I think third party terminal applications might give you more control. I believe [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/), by default, starts searching from bottom upwards. <comment282645> @Joonas, thanks a lot for the reply. Indeed it's not pure solution but it's something that can help
