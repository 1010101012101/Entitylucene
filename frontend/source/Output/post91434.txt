Using an iPhone as a Remote Video Recorder from a Mac <body> Does there exist any app for iPhone/Mac that allows me:  ul lito see on the Macbook what my iPhone camera "sees" via WiFi?/li lito remotely, from the Mac, start/stop recording on the iPhone?/li /ul  I'm currently trying iKeyboardRemote but it allows me only start and stop recording via Bluetooth (and without any feedback). I would like to see when to start recording and when to stop.  I have found several apps in the App Store that allow remote video between two iPhones or iPhone/iPad, but found none for iPhone to Mac OS X.  (I don't have two iPhones, nor an iPad).  Unfortunately, I have upgraded to 6.1.3 on 4S, so I can't jailbreak it for installing a VNC server, which would be the easiest and best solution.  I'm hoping I missed some apps â€” can anybody suggest a solution?  <answer91435> There seem to be a handful of apps available that allow your iPhone to act as a webcam for your Mac over Wi-Fi, which would allow you to view and record video from them. A few of the ones I found:  ul liPocketCam/li liMobiola WebCamera/li liiWebcamera/li /ul  For recording purposes, you may need to use the built-in recording functionality of QuickTime Player, although some of the apps seem to have free companion OS X software that will accomplish the same goal.  <comment107368> When you do get your second iOS device - [this is ultimate](http://motrr.com/galileo.html). <comment107371> GREAT! Thank you, going compare them. :) I do not need recording on the Mac side - for me enough to record on the iphone side. <comment107372> @bassplayer7 YES! This is really cool device. <comment107374> hm... jaggy on full hd - need something what will record into iPhone - and will transferring to Mac only preview. <comment107375> You can use screen mirroring to view your screen on e.g. an AppleTV. <comment259339> I also need the functionality to preview on the Mac, but record to the iPhone itself. I want to have full 4K quality video from my iPhone 6s. <comment319142> Shame on Apple. +1 for this answer. <comment319259> @bassplayer7 link appears to be broken <comment319320> @AllDani, unfortunately, they kinda [went away](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://motrr.com/). <comment319326> @bassplayer7 maybe next time :)
