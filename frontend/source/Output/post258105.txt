Rstudio Server vs El Capitan <body> I am trying to install RStudio Server in OSX El Capitan.  I did these steps from terminal  precodebrew install openssl  brew install homebrew/science/rstudio-server /code/pre  I have the login window at localhost:8787 but I can't login. If I run  precodesudo rstudio-server status  /code/pre  then I get  precodeCould not find service "com.rstudio.launchd.rserver" in domain for  /code/pre  To check the installation I run  precodesudo rstudio-server verify-installation /code/pre  and I get  precode21 Oct 2016 05:11:44 [rserver] ERROR system error 48 (Address already in use);  OCCURRED AT: rstudio::core::Error rstudio::core::http::initTcpIpAcceptor(SocketAcceptorService&lt;boost::asio::ip::tcp&gt; &amp;, const std::string &amp;, const std::string &amp;) /tmp/rstudio-server-20161017-46697-nr3wo3/rstudio- 0.99.902/src/cpp/core/include/core/http/TcpIpSocketUtils.hpp:103; LOGGED FROM: int main(int, char *const *) /tmp/rstudio-server-20161017-46697-nr3wo3/rstudio-0.99.902/src/cpp/server/ServerMain.cpp:438 /code/pre  How can I fix this?  <answer258147> You forgot to install and launch the related launch daemon and modify some other things. To fix this do the following:  ul liCopy a pre-made plist:  precodesudo cp /usr/local/opt/rstudio-server/share/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /code/pre/li liCheck permissions:  precodesudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist  sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /code/pre/li liModify the plist:  precodesudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /code/pre  and replace  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/opt/rstudio-server/bin/rserver&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;--server-daemonize=0&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  by  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/opt/rstudio-server/bin/rserver&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;--server-daemonize=0&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;--auth-minimum-user-id=500&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  This step is necessary because rstudio-server's default auth-minimum-user-id is 1000 and the common OS X user's first ID is 501, the second user's ID is 502 etc./li liCopy a pam:  precodesudo cp /etc/pam.d/ftpd /etc/pam.d/rstudio /code/pre/li liLaunch the daemon and start rstudio:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist sudo rstudio-server start /code/pre/li /ul  Finally launch a broswer, enter emlocalhost:8787/em in the address bar and log-in with your OS X user credentials.   To stop rstudio server enter codesudo rstudio-server stop/code. After a reboot you have to enter codesudo rstudio-server start/code to start it again.  hr  If you want the rstudio-server to be launched automatically while booting, stop the server, unload the launch daemon,  precodesudo rstudio-server stop sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /code/pre  modify the file /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist with emnano/em and set the RunAtLoad key from emfalse/em to emtrue/em. Finally load the launch daemon again:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /code/pre  <answer258277> Here I have explained the steps you provided and more: http://pacha.hk/rstudio_server.html  In general, you just can't restart the server without affecting other users.   Thanks a lot for the instructions.  <answer282075> I Just want to give some updates for the updated formula coderstudio-server v1.0.143/code.  Some of the files have been relocated for consistency.  precode/usr/local/opt/rstudio-server/share/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /code/pre  was moved to  precode/usr/local/opt/rstudio-server/extras/launchd/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /code/pre  and the pam file is now bundled with the formula  precode/usr/local/opt/rstudio-server/extras/pam/rstudio /code/pre  As a side note for people encountering the warning  precodeCharacter set is not UTF-8; please change your locale  /code/pre  It can be fixed by editing   precode/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.rstudio.launchd.rserver.plist /code/pre  and adding the following environmental variable  precode    &lt;key&gt;EnvironmentVariables&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;            &lt;key&gt;LANG&lt;/key&gt;            &lt;string&gt;en_US.UTF-8&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  <comment322763> thanks a lot, this clearly helps <comment322764> thanks a lot, this clearly helps I had to do an additional step that is to go to apple icon - system preferences - users & groups and add the group rstudio then it works <comment322767> probably network settings or something... but it works great ! <comment322770> @pachamaltese I don't have to create an rstudio group to have access immediately - but maybe I'm missing something because I set up a vanilla brew install of r/rstudio. But the [description on your web page](http://pacha.hk/rstudio_server.html) is not correct: if you set the key [RunAtLoad] to true, you **don't** have to start rstudio server explicitly once more with `sudo rstudio-server start` because it already runs after booting OS X. <comment322779> yes, that's right <comment322780> yes, that's right I did set autoboot not to run `sudo rstudio-server start` <comment322781> I wrote that to have a safe copy if I break something later. The second after I install rstudio-server via brew I need to run `sudo rstudio-server start` <comment326402> I am the one who wrote the homebrew formula for rstudio-server. Glad to know that someone is actually using that formula. (I discovered this thread just by chance)
