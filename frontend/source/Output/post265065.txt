What does this Japanese message in the App Store when updating apps mean? <body> I have been using the Japanese version of App Store for quite a while but lately I can't update my downloaded apps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8GcnL.png" width="375"  Every time I try to update my apps this message comes up and since I can't read Japanese I have no idea what App Store wants. Can somebody please help me?  <answer265068> It says the Apple ID you used is invalid.   <comment332325> Totally lost why you are using the Japanese App Store if you don't understand Japanese. <comment332335> What?
