Apple Photos excess storage taken up <body> My new iPhone 7 shows that I am taking up 22 GB of photo storage compared to my wife's 6s Plus only taking up 7 GB.  We share the same photos and iCloud.  I tried re-setting up my phone as a new phone which worked temporarily to reduce my photo storage but it shot back up again.  Any idea what could be causing this?  <comment331695> Is "Optimize device storage" checked on her iPhone? Look under iCloud Photo Library Settings. <comment331699> I suspect that @JaimeSantaCruz is on the right track. Also, can you clarify how it is that you _share the same photos and iCloud_? This could also be relevant. <comment331975> We share the same Apple ID, so when she takes photos and I take photos, they are both uploaded to the same iCloud account.  That creates the conundrum: we each show the same number of photos and videos in our respective Photos apps, but when you go to examine our storage, her photos only take up 7 GB and mine take up 32 GB.
