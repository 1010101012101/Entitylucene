Installing dual boot Sierra and Kali-Linux <body> I'm trying to install a dual boot with Kali-Linux 2.0 on my Macbook Pro (mid July 2016) running MacOS Sierra 10.12  I format my usb key to exFat and a guid partition. Then with the dd command I burn the kali-linux iso to the drive by getting the disk identifier with the diskutil list command.  To succeed to boot to the usb drive, I have to boot without plug it and hold down the option key, then I can plug the usb drive and click to EFI boot.  When I'm here, I have the Kali-Linux menu (Sometimes I just get a black freezing screen) the kali-linux menu is very small in the top-left corner.  So I try to use the graphical install and it freeze everything I try. I tried to go to my usb drive and modify the syslinux.cfg file to change "vesamenu.c32" to "menu.c32" but when I do that I can't get the kali-linux menu anymore.  Someone succeeded to install a dual boot on a MacBook Pro Sierra 10.12 and Kali-LInux 2.0 ? How can I do that ?  Thanks for your attention.  <answer261339> I have managed to get Kali Linux running from USB with persistence, on a Macbook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) with macOS Sierra.  Here's my guide explaining the process I used. I've tried to make it easy to follow, whilst still being as detailed as possible.  strongPart 1: Preparing the USB/strong  Note: if you don't want persistence, just create 1 partition and finish the guide at part 3.  ol liOpen disk utility (Finder  Applications  Utilities  Disk Utility)./li liSelect your USB device./li liChoose emerase/em./li listrongName:/strong Untitled | strongFormat:/strong Mac OS Extended (Journaled) | strongScheme:/strong GUID Partition Map./li liClick emdone/em./li liSelect your newly formatted USB device./li liChoose empartition/em./li liClick the "+" symbol at the bottom of the window./li listrongName (left partition):/strong Persistence | strongName (right partition):/strong Kali Linux./li listrongFormat (both partitions):/strong MS-DOS (FAT)./li liClick emapply/em./li liClick empartition/em./li /ol  After this process, your partitions (Kali Linux and Persistence) may have renamed themselves to "K L" and "P" respectively.

Do you know about other workaround?.
