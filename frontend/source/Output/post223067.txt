Problem with 3 TB Fusion Drive, it can't be deleted, formatted or partitioned <body> I want to clarify that I already followed the instruction with I think I messed up the Fusion Drive on my 1TB iMac (with BootCamp) but I think I have mayor problems.   I followed the instructions to 'Rebuild Fusion Drive' (recommended if you have a Time Machine backup) but when I tried to delete the LVG with codediskutil cs delete LVGUUID/code, it showed an error that the disk couldn't be unmounted. After exiting emTerminal/em and opening emDisk Utility/em it seemed to work because it showed me the message that I need to fix the disk. I ignored the message and continued partitioning the drive, but when I tried to partition the HDD volume I got an error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6js4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If you need more details, let me know, I am pretty novice in this kind of issues.  Hope you can help me, by the way, I never had installed bootcamp I don't know why my iMac stated to act so bad.  This are the results of codediskutil cs list/code and codediskutil list/code:  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE   IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1 2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         121.0 GB   disk0s2 3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *1.3 GB     disk1 1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk1s1 2:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        1.3 GB     disk1s2 /dev/disk2 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk2 /dev/disk3 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk3 /dev/disk4 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk4 /dev/disk5 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk5 /dev/disk6 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk6 /dev/disk7 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *6.3 MB     disk7 /dev/disk8 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *2.1 MB     disk8 /dev/disk9 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk9 /dev/disk10 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk10 /dev/disk11 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk11 /dev/disk12 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk12 /dev/disk13 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk13 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk13s1 2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         3.0 TB     disk13s2 3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk13s3 /dev/disk14 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *3.1 TB     disk14 -bash-3.2# diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group AA82B910-5B4C-4771-8CD9-DA1BB2DB1DB3 ========================================================= Name:         Internal Drive Status:       Online Size:         3121237860352 B (3.1 TB) Free Space:   32768 B (32.8 KB) | +-&lt;

To allow the installation of OS X the partition has to be removed. This probably works:  Booted to Internet Recovery Mode and after opening Terminal do the following:  ul liEnter codediskutil list/code to get the disk identifiers and the sizes of all partitions/li liEnter codediskutil cs list/code to get the UUIDs and sizes of all CoreStorage items/li liEnter codegpt -r show /dev/diskX/code diskX is the disk identifier of the 3 TB hard drive - strongnot/strong the CoreStorage Logical Volume which has a similar size/li liFirst slightly resize the CoreStorage Logical Volume Group:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID size /code/pre  In your case (with the data provided in your question) this is  precodediskutil cs resizeStack F9ECE596-8E42-4059-819C-7829C3FD4CB1 3115g /code/pre/li liUnmount all disks related with the physical disks in your Mac  First unmount the Logical Volume.
