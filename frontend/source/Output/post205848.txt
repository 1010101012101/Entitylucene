How to change the language of the date (day of week) in Yosemite's lock screen? <body> When my iMac enters the lock screen, my default language for the buttons is German; but the language of the day of week displayed in the upper right corner is English. Is there a way to change this?  <answer205871> You may want to check this article from Apple's website.     strongOS X Yosemite: Customize formats to display dates, times, and more/strong      Change the language and formats used to display dates, times, numbers,   and currencies in Finder windows and apps, such as Mail. For example,   if the region for your Mac is set to United States, but the format   language is set to French, then dates in Finder windows and email   messages appear in French.      Tip:   If you just want to change how time is shown in the menu bar,   select the “Time format” checkbox in the Language &amp; Region preference   pane, or select the 24-hour option in the Clock pane of Date &amp; Time   preferences. To show the date in the menu bar, also select “Show Date”   in the Clock pane.      ol   liChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Language &amp; Region./li   liChoose a geographic region from the Region pop-up menu, to use the region’s date, time, number, and currency formats./li   liTo customize the formats or change the language used to display them, click Advanced, then set options.      In the General pane, you can choose the language to use for showing   dates, times, and numbers, and set formats for numbers, currency, and   measurements.      In the Dates and Times panes, you can type in the Short, Medium, Long,   and Full fields, and rearrange or delete elements. You can also drag   new elements, such as Quarter or Milliseconds, into the fields. If   you’re not using a 24-hour clock, you can replace AM and PM with   whatever you type in those fields./li   liWhen you’re done customizing formats, click OK.      The region name in Language &amp; Region preferences now includes “Custom”   to indicate that you customized formats.      Your formats are visible in Finder windows and in some apps. For   example, dates in Mail or Notes show your custom format./li   /ol      To undo all of your changes for a region, choose the region again from   the Region pop-up menu. To undo just your changes to advanced options,   click Advanced, click the pane where you want to undo your changes,   then click Restore Defaults.   <answer206341> Uncheck the Date options in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Date &amp; Time &gt; Clock/code tab.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pUsZX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then close and reopen System Preferences, and re-check the two options.   <comment248363> I assume the rest of the OS is displaying German text, yes? <comment248423> Unfortunately this doesn't help, because my language and region settings all match German. And all displayed dates, times and so on in applications show the correct format - except the one displayed on the lock screen. <comment248424> That's correct. <comment248429> @mortomanos This thread from the Apple community is old but could you check if the post by Jurek Zakrecki works: [link](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3300685) <comment248444> Try un-checking the Date options (Show the day...|Show date) in System Preferences  Date & Time  Clock tab. Then close System Preferences, go back and re-check the two options. <comment248722> Cool, that worked. You could post an answer so I can mark the answer as solution and upvote it!
