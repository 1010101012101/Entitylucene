Where does the Mac version of the iPhone Configuration Utility store its data? <body> I am using the iPhone Configuration Utility to set up some iPads. I'm just setting up some web clippings and one wireless network and see that the utility is keeping a nice record of all the serial numbers as I attach them and install the same profile.  The export function doesn't seem to save this data so I'm wondering where it is stored so perhaps I can get it into a spreadsheet or other format other than a screen capture.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dozGa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer36712> ~/Library/MobileDevice/Devices  The files appear to be stored as a plist with the device's UDID as the name.
