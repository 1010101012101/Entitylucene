Export to Quicktime VR in OsiriX <body> I am using OsiriX (5.8.5 32-bit) to generate a 3D MIP from a series of DICOM images. According to the official site and every other site I have looked at, exporting a Quicktime VR is one click away. The MIP looks great, however I cannot see the option to export to Quicktime VR anywhere. I have seen the option in the user guides as a button in the toolbar (it looks somewhat 5 years old), though I can't imagine they'd take away such a handy feature.  Anyone else manage to find it?  <answer132746> Found it! It's no where to be found in recent versions of OsiriX. I had to go back to OsiriX 4.0. Works beautifully though, however you need QT7 to open the files.  <comment157031> The best I can do is a movie export to a .mov, which is an animated rotation of the 3D object. <comment157033> Looking in the files of the application, I found the icon which appears in the user guides. Too bad it doesn't show up in the actual application.
