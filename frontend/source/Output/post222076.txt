cloudd: Tons of downstream - why? <body> Using the iStat Menus app, I can see (some) network activity connected to certain applications. Some, because Google Chrome, for instance, does never appear in the list of apps.  Since I had forgotten my internet gateway that I usually use in my dorm (a construct of a Raspberry Pi and an Airport Extreme plus a wifi dongle) back at home, but had the dongle with me, I plugged that in my mac and connected. And while this is a dongle, it has an LED that flashes on activity. On my Pi, the activity LED is re-routed to a GPIO LED - but for the time being, it sits next to the side of my macbook.  So at some point I noticed that it was blinking a lot, and all that I was running was codessh/code and Atom, plus some local daemons like MySQL and PHP-FPM. So I went to see what iStat Menu had to say, and it reported:  precodecloudd        755 kb/s /code/pre  ... Where is that coming from?  I did a google search to see if it was possible to observe iCloud activity on my Mac, but it didn't turn up anything useful.  So: How do I know what codecloudd/code is doing, that requires so much downstream?And that came out of nowhere too. I haven't touched my phone the entire day, except for a call or two.
