Test application for Retina and Non Retina <body> I have a MBP retina 13" running OSX 10.10.  I am developing an app for Mac App store.br Since I am having a retina display, I am not able to test the application for non retina models ? So how do I test my application for non retina displays.br Will it work if I reduce the screen resolution ??  <answer177096> You might use a third party program like http://www.resolutiontab.com to do this more effectively.  Also, you can open some apps in low-resolution mode via their info panels, just check the option and reopen the app, i.e. Photoshop:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xx6xH.png" alt="Photoshop App Info"
