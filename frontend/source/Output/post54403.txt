How to choose a application without using the mouse in Lion Mission Control? <body> While using Mission Control and pressing kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbd↑/kbd, I get the tiled view of all the applications in that particular desktop. Is there a keyboard shortcut to choose an application in this view?  <answer54541> No.  I haven't found any, but that's not surprising.  Mission Control was provided for mouse / touch interaction.  Have you tried using kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd for app switching and kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbd`/kbdfor window switching?   They are much more efficient if you're interested in keeping your hands on the keys.   <answer63923> You can type the name of the window (not the name of the app) and it will select the windows in mission control that matchs. What I don't know how to swicth between all the coincidences.  <answer245503> Try hyperswitch (https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch) - you can switch between windows only from current desktop.  <comment62266> [A similar question at Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/313055/how-to-make-mission-control-keyboard-friendly) <comment62271> I tried a variety of key combos but to no avail. I'm not sure that it is possible... <comment62278> I think so too. Thank you @Jonathan. I will keep this question open and will try to see if there are other workarounds. <comment62650> Command + Tab switches over all the open application. If there is a way to sandbox that behavior to a particular desktop, it will be much more useful. It is also surprising that there is a lack of consistency. Arrow keys works, while working with multiple windows of same application. <comment62652> Okay.  Now that *is* doable.  Visit System Preferences- Mission Control and uncheck **When Switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application**.
