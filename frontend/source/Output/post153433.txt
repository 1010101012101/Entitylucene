Transfer/Migrate specific apps including settings etc to a new Mac <body> I did a clean install upgrade to OS X Yosemite (from Mavericks).  Prior to doing that I backed up my entire hard disk using a disk cloner (Carbon Copy Cloner in my case)  Is there a way I can transfer a few specific apps from my previous installation (including settings, licenses etc) to the new one?  <answer153495> mackup does this:  https://github.com/lra/mackup  I don't have personal experience with it, but i've heard great things. Bear in mind you should check the list of software currently supported by it before you install.  <comment180666> regarding apps to transfer, you could create a cask in homebrew and host it on dropbox or your cloud of choice. <comment180768> Thanks... this sounds promising. I am not very experienced using Homebrew (have just used it once). Can you elaborate your answer a little bit more? <comment210198> first check out **[homebrew](http://brew.sh/)**
