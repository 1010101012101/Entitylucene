extracting multiple zips/rar into same folder <body> maybe I am stupid, but I just cant figure out how to extract multiple zips into the same folder easy.  I always end up with folders of the zip name that then has the content in it... this is really annoying.  Is there a app that does this automatically?   thx  <answer3748> One real easy way is to use codeunzip/code on the command line.   strong1)/strong If the ZIP file doesn't contain any folder hierarchy, simply files at the "root" level of the compressed file, do this:  ol liopen Terminal and codecd/code to the folder with the ZIP file/li licodeunzip zipfile.zip/code/li /ol  - The files are extracted directly into that folder.   strong2)/strong If the ZIP file does contain a folder hierarchy, but you emstill/em want to extract everything in the same folder (usually not a good idea, as the hierarchy is there probably for a reason), do the same thing as above, but with code-j/code modifier for unzip, which means "junk paths (do not make directories)":  precodeunzip -j zipfile.zip /code/pre  strongEdit/strong: the same approach works for RAR files, except you'd need to install the command-line unrar tool yourself (unlike with unzip), and I'm not sure what the equivalent for unzip's -j modifier is.  <comment229350> thanks, but there must be a app does doesn't require command line input :/
