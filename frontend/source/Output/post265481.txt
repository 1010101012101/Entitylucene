Mount network drive to Mac server on boot <body> Is it possible to mount a network drive to my Mac server on boot, without requiring a login?  I have one setup to mount on login via an automator script that I have added to the login items for the user account, which works fine.  The reason is I don't want to have to login to the Mac server, just to mount the network drive.  <answer265499> Simply create a launch daemon with the purpose to mount a remote share:  ol liCreate a mountpoint:  precodesudo mkdir -p /Shares/mntpoint1 /code/pre/li liAdd a launch daemon in /Library/LaunchDaemons:  precodesudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.mount.extvol.plist  /code/pre  with the content:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;local.mount.extvol&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/sbin/mount_afp&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;afp://user:password@remotehost/share/&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Shares/mntpoint1&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre/li liLoad the daemon with  precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.mount.extvol.plist  /code/pre/li /ol  The remotehost and share have to exist and the user has to have permissions to access the share with the password. The user doesn't have to be root!  The share will be loaded with root:wheel 700 permissions.  <comment332830> Once time I made an account to mount drives and then log out and set that to auto log in. This might be a nicer solution if there's a way to script this. <comment332860> What's the purpose of the share mounted to the server machine?
