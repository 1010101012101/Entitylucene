Error Relating to AppTranslocation in macOS Sierra <body> It would appear that Gatekeeper in macOS Sierra is a bit pickier. At any rate, it is causing a small utility I made some years ago to throw a rather annoying error.  As I haven't yet had the time to dig into the under-the-hood changes in Sierra, I'm not sure how to fix the error. Does anyone have experience dealing with errors relating to AppTranslocation and fixing them?  Code and error follow:  strongCode/strong:  precodetell application "Finder" set currentDir to POSIX path of ((container of (path to me)) as text) end tell set currentDir to quoted form of currentDir set lib80211 to quoted form of "AirPort Utility 5.6.1 Launcher.app/Contents/Resources/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Apple80211"  do shell script "export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=" &amp; currentDir &amp; lib80211 &amp; " cd " &amp; currentDir &amp; "AirPort\\ Utility\\ 5.6.1.app/Contents/MacOS ./AirPort\\ Utility" /code/pre  strongError/strong:  precodesh: line 1: cd: /private/var/folders/t4/7k5z832d2tjd4xpzvvq43n4m0000gn/T/AppTranslocation/23AF67A4-3DF7-4982-A1A3-B019CDACB4C2/dAirPort Utility 5.6.1.app/Contents/MacOS: No such file or directory sh: line 2: ./AirPort Utility: No such file or directory (127) /code/pre  <answer255176> The problem seems to be simpler than thatâ€”It looks like the update removed Airport Utility 5.6.1.app from under /Applications/Airport Utility 5.6.1. I copied the directory back in place from an old backup and things work again.  <answer256791> It's working perfectly for me under macOS Sierra 10.12. I redownloaded the .dmg and installed it and everything is the same as it was under El Capitan.  <answer256836> Well, after a fairly significant amount of trial and error (and a bit of reading about how AppTranslocation works in macOS 10.12 Sierra), I've discovered a fix.  In essence, you have to open the *.dmg and then emmove/em the contents to some other folder in Finder. The catch: If you move both simultaneously, AppTranslocation may 'tag' them (seemingly permanently) and continue to run *every time you try to launch either *.app); this seems like a bug, and I intend to report it to Apple.  strongThe Solution/strong  Re-download the *.dmg (as others have stated) strongand/strong move the two files it contains emone at a time/em into a folder (preferably Utilities, but it's up to you where you want them to reside). Once you've done this, run the Launcher and everything should work as before.  <comment317826> The Launcher is working for you under macOS 10.12 Sierra? It throws an error, *supra*, for me every time I attempt to run it (unless I run it from *within* Script Editor, then it works). <comment320421> That's very odd. I now have a handful of reports that it throws an error (like the one posted, *supra*), and another handful of reports that it works exactly the same as under El Capitan and prior.
