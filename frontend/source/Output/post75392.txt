How can I restore an iCloud backup to a new device? <body> I have a new iPad And am trying to restore it from the back up of my old iPad. iCloud storage shows 3 backups - my iPhone, my old iPad and the new iPad (empty).   How do I get the old iPad backup on to my new iPad?  <answer75393> When you get to the first few screens, one is the restore or new iPad screen. There you select restore from iCloud backup. If you go past this screen you will need to reset the device from the settings.  <answer75394> It sounds like you set up the new iPad as a "new iPad".

Seems new ipad was using an older iOS than the old one was when i backed it up, which is why it couldn't find the iCloud backup and forced me to set it up as a new ipad and use iTunes. It is all better now!  <answer153004> HI go to recycle bin and click yourself.
