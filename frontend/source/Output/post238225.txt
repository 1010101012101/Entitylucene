Which types of SSD are compatible with mac book pro mid-2012 (not retina)? <body> I am looking to replace the hard drive of my macbook pro mid 2012 with an SSD from an ASUS taichi laptop will the SSD from the taichi be compatible with my mac book?  <answer238239> If your MacBook Pro is non-Retina : open both, take a look, if the storage connecter identical then you can switch between them.  If your MacBook Pro is Retina : simply NO :)
