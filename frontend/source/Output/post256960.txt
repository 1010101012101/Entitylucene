Is it possible to use an iPhone 5 with tracfone service byop? <body> I am trying to use an iPhone 5 with Tracfone's byop. However I can't seem to find the right sim card. At first Tracfone said that I needed an at&amp;t SIM card but it doesn't work with iPhone 5 for it is much to big.  Can anyone help me?  <answer256979> I recently purchased this kit I learned about on a deals forum.   It comes with SIM cards in standard, micro and nano sizes. I have not activated it yet but you can buy different levels of time to add. I have installed the card in my 4S but I still have time left on my non-smartphone tracfone.
