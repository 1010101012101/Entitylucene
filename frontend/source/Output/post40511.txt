iOS Remote.app URL Scheme <body> I've discovered that Apple's Remote.app on iOS has a URL scheme. Opening coderemote:///code opens the app. Does anyone know of any other ways to, say, open a certain playlist/shared library via this URL scheme? Or is it just for opening the app?  <answer41872> You can use URL Schemes to not only open an app but you can use it to open a playlist. example  <comment47493> Does this app work with Apple's Remote app? Or the local Music player app? Or something else entirely?
