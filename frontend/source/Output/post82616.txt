Cellular data not working after software update? <body> I have updated my iphone software to 6.1 on my 3GS and now my cellular data network is not available. Can this be fixed or can I restore an earlier version again?  <answer82620> Did you check your settings for your APN? Since iOS 6 it tends to clear the value on random times for some people. You can check this within Settings  General  Cellular  Cellular Data Network  APN.  You can only edit this setting if your carrier allows this.

It appears that Data Bolt-On, that I subscribe to, was no longer iPhone compatible. I was advised that this setting was affected by the Software Update. Not sure I really understand how or why but I was assured that the setting had now been amended and data services would be restored at midnight tonight  <comment95305> I would be interested to know if your carrier could help you with this? Also, 6.1.1 is the latest update - for at least iPhone 4S (not sure about the 3GS). Make sure there are no updates available. I know 6.1.1 was supposed to help with some connection problems. What carrier are you with? <comment95319> There is no such setting on my iPhone with iOS 6 (the  Cellular Data Network  APN part). Try going to this site and loading the necessary settings for your carrier: http://www.unlockit.co.nz/unlockit/ <comment95340> The option is only available for unlocked iPhones <comment95346> My phone is unlocked and doesn't have that option. Do you mean jailbroken phones? Or do you mean the APN setting from the website? <comment95600> With some carriers it's editable with no extra configuration. So without jailbreaking your device.It's a setting that is carrier dependent. You can find additional info here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2283
