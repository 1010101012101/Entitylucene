Strange Globbing behaviour on Windows from Lion server <body> So here's the craziest thing I've ever seen (maybe). Hoping someone can shed some light here.  We have an OS X Lion Mini that's sharing out a folder to some Windows machines. We also have a program which searches through that share for files using a globbing pattern like "em.Text./em". Crazy thing here, is while it works on every other operating system implementing SMB, it WILL NOT WORK on Lion.  The problem here is deep within Windows as not only does our application not get results properly, neither does the command line!  Here's some output:  precodeV:\tasks&gt;dir /b *Completed* 999_050_999_0759acc4_00000_0-0.Completed.Machine  V:\tasks&gt;dir /b *.Completed.* File Not Found /code/pre  The file is clearly there, and this kind of functionality has been fundamental for our application for a heck of a long time. The .net framework throws some exception about a 'bad pathname' or something similar.  Anyone else see this before? We're working around it now programmatically, but it'd be good to know how to solve it for others. Is there a way I can submit a bug report to Apple?  <comment61561> Can you share the exception line that shows the path .Net thinks it's using? <comment61574> You can report bugs to Apple at bugreport.apple.com. (You do have to register first.)
