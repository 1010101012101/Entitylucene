Delete a location from time machine <body> I have a folder in code~/Downloads/Media/code with lot of media files backed up in time machine. Since I moved the files back and forth it has taken so much space in my external drive. Can anyone tell me a way to remove the location from codeTime Machine/code completely? I want to remove the location permanently.   <answer220094> Open System Prefs  Time Machine, then click Options…br You can add exclusions to the list, by clicking the + &amp; navigating to the location, or simply by dragging any folder/drive etc into the box.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LG09t.png" alt="enter image description here"  It would appear that anything already backed up will stay in the older backups until eventually it just 'falls off' over time, as Time Machine cycles through your drive space.  <comment266319> would that delete old capsules of the folder? <comment266322> I'm not sure. They'll either be removed at next backup, or just gradually fall off as the backups get older. Either way, the space will free up. <comment266323> Cool, I just did it. <comment266324> Ah… just checked - they will fall off over time. I still have an old backup of something I excluded recently. It's gone from newer backups but is still there in older ones. I'll add that to the answer. <comment266325> My disk is almost full, I gues it will fall off with the time. (y)
