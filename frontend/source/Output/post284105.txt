Right place for .so files <body> I'm compiling a few modules for apache where is the best place to put them on OSX systems? It seems that root user doesn't have permissions to write on /usr/local.  <answer284112> I never understood why "shared" libraries that are exclusive for one application should mess up a system folder. I would create a codemodules/code folder inside apache, add it to the codedyld/code path and run codeupdate_dyld_shared_cache/code. When I want to remove the software one day, I just delete the folder in one place.  <comment358312> Root user does have permissions to write to any directory <comment358314> @Mark, this is not true on OSX: $ sudo mv /usr/lib/libiodbcinst.dylib /usr/lib/libiodbcinst.dylib1   results on  mv: rename /usr/lib/libiodbcinst.dylib to /usr/lib/libiodbcinst.dylib1: Operation not permitted <comment358329> Sorry I forgot SIP - however /usr/local is not protected by SIP so that directory is writeable to by root <comment358333> So I need to compile everything with --prefix=/usr/local and when you talk about SIP you mean System Integrity Protection (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899), right? thank you. <comment358336> Most things have that prefix by default as that is **THE** Unix place to installed - and yes SIP is what you defined
