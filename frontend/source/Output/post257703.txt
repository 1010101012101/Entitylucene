Language mismatch in Apple menu bar <body> The default language on my iMac is Italian, however, after restoring from a time machine backup, the language of the shutdown and reboot options from the menu bar have mixed language. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fYTBL.png" alt="enter image description here"  The "countdown" is in Italian but the other text is not, as you can see. Also, the text of the password prompt of the lock screen is in English too, "Enter password". I tried switching the language to English and back to Italian but it didn't work. I'm running OS X 10.11.6.
