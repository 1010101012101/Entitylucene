Why are some shortcuts modified with the Shift key while others are modified with the Option key? <body> I have used Windows for all of my life. In Windows, shortcuts are (almost) always initiated with the kbdControl/kbd key. Modifications to those shortcuts are then done with the kbd⇧/kbd key. So, for example, you move to the next tab using kbdControl/kbdkbdTab ↹/kbd and move to the previous tab using kbdControl/kbdkbd⇧/kbdkbdTab ↹/kbd.  I have recently moved to OS X and I'm having a hard time remembering when to use kbd⌥/kbd and when to use kbd⇧/kbd in combination with kbd⌘/kbd. I almost never get it right. It is like it is random, but I want to think there is actually a rule.  So, does this rule actually exist?  <answer181250> Well, coming from a Windows background myself, I can state the following:  ol liThe strongCmd/strong key is usually like strongCtrl/strong on Windows (e.g., strongCtrl+c/strong == strongCmd+c/strong)./li liAs with Windows, the strongShift/strong key is a common modifier to the strongCmd/strong key./li liI believe that Macs traditionally had an strongOption/strong key, which also came to be known as the strongAlt/strong key (perhaps to help those accustomed to Windows)./li liAside from that, both strongCtrl/strong and strongOption/strong are treated like modifiers on the strongCmd/strong key./li /ol  Between different Mac applications, there is sorta an effort to have some consistency in what certain key combinations do. For example, strongCtrl+Cmd+f/strong is usually a full-screen toggle.  However, the consistency of such keyboard shortcuts can vary per the software publisher.  Now, as a person that is familiar with Windows, you'll notice that strongAlt/strong doesn't activate a menu mode, such as being able to drill down to a specific menu item.  However,you can create a keyboard shortcut via strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong  strongApp Shortcuts/strong. Just type the shortcut name as it appears in the application's menu.  <comment215478> maybe you can look it up here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236 <comment215481> Tab switching can actually be done any of 3 ways - ctrl (shift) tab; cmd shift left-right arrow; or cmd shift [ or ] <comment215483> @Buscar웃, I was actually asking for the philosophy behind it. <comment215485> I do not know the philosophy behind it on OS X, would you mind explaining it for Windows! <comment215620> @Buscar웃 I already did? Windows uses ⇧ to modify shortcuts only.
