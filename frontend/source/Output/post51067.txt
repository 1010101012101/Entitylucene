How can I see what custom URI schemes are registered? <body> One of the neat things about OmniFocus is that you can add tasks to it by calling codeomnifocus:///add?name={query}/code from a browser, or launcher (like Alfred or LaunchBar). I'd like to know what other functions there are to call for it, and other apps as well.  I poked through the codeinfo.plist/code of Package Contents of the app, but it only detailed that codeomnifocus:///code was indeed registered as a custom scheme. And I couldn't find any reference to it on Omni's site as well.  <answer51096> I like to use RCDefaultApp to manage handlers for protocols and URIs.  There may be a better way to do it programmatically, but Rubicode's RCDefaultApp is very useful for a lot of other reasons too.  When you dump the launch services database does it show up there?    precode /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -h /code/pre  <comment58419> While I didn't figure out how to find specific URI schemes, I did solve my problems with an AppleScript that I imported into Alfred. <comment58422> That's definitely nicer than poking through plists, but doesn't quite answer my question :). I don't want to know just what URI schemes are registered, but what functions they'll respond to. <comment58432> I added the path of lsregister to my suggestion, maybe the arguments and variables can be mined that way?
