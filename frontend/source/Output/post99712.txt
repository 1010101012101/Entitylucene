Turning off text to speech in iMessage <body> How can I turn off the "text to speech" feature in iMessage?  I don't mind iMessage bouncing in the dock when a message comes in, but I can't have iMessage speaking the message.  Not only is this feature distracting, but sometimes a message is private and I don't want anyone within earshot hearing my text "conversations"...I'm running OS X Version 10.8.4  <answer99716> Try this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vh9ej.png" alt="enter image description here"  Uncheck "Speak an announcement".
