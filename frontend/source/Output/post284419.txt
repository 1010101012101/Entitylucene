Tracking the application usage time in iOS device using MDM <body> After the long research, I found that By MDM we can find the install application in an iOS device and also set the application usage time and get data usage and much more...  But my overall target is that...  I want to get the install app usage time in iOS Device.  I found that it's is not possible in non-jailbroken. Apple does not give the permission to the app usage time.  My question is that, is this possible to get the application usage time by MDM Protocol.
