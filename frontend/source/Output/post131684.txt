Creating second Developer Account <body> Is it better to create new Apple ID for my developer account, or is it ok to use my existing one?   And what are the rules regarding names (like can I use nickname or I have to use my real one)?   I'm individual not a company, and will be creating an individual account.   <answer131694>    Is it better to create new Apple ID for my developer account, or is it ok to use my existing one?   I would recommend creating a new one. Apple doesn't seem to care either way, but it's usually a good idea to separate the two accounts.     And what are the rules regarding names (like can I use nickname or I have to use my real one)?   You have to use your real name. This is for identification and since the agreement is legally binding, I wouldn't risk it (plus, do you really want DenverCoder9 to show up on your banking records?).  <comment154765> Thank You. Guess i will create new Gmail then new Apple ID.
