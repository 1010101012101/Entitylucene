Random emails missing from IMAP inbox with Apple Mail in Yosemite <body> I am using Apple Mail with three IMAP mail accounts (not Gmail etc. but from my hosting provider).  I'm finding that I regularly need to close and reopen Mail to find emails I'm searching for that are not showing up in the inbox. They reappear after the restart where I expect them to be. Not the biggest issue but it's happening a lot.  What is causing this?  <comment218826> Most likely not your device.  An IMAP inbox is a server side folder that synches with your device, the problem is likely the hosting providers. <comment218827> When you click the "get mail" button at the top left of the window, do they appear like if you do a restart? <comment218830> Thanks both. Kevin, its just the odd email. I was looking for a message I knew I had received but it wasn't in the inbox or coming up in a search. When I restarted the application it was there. It had been there previously as well. Odd <comment218837> Is there a issue with size or the amount of emails downloads? do you have lots of Rules ? Is the lost email in the "Archive" folder? <comment218938> It may happen that the mailbox index got screwed up.  Have you tried rebuilding the mailbox(es)?  In case you did not, here is how: Select the mailbox you want to rebuild, then click on menu "Mailbox"  "Rebuild".  In many cases, that can solve issues like that. <comment218984> Hi Buscar - Only a couple of rules relating to an account that hasn't been effected and simply to forward to another account. Size shouldn't be an issue. I have it set to only sync attachments when asked. I'll check for Archive next time it happens. But don't think they were there. <comment218985> Phoenix. Thanks. I will try rebuilding. But would that create/solve an ad-hoc, random issue? My wife incidentally suffers the same on her Mac. With accounts from the same host. Typing that makes mw think I need to flag it with them.
