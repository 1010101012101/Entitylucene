Mount command can not contain Chinese characters <body> I encounter a problem,  I want to mount a shared remote directory, but the url has Chinese characters.    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codemount_smbfs //user:password@192.168.1.168/图片 /Volumes/picture /code/pre  图片 are Chinese characters, which mean picture in English.  When I execute this command, I get below error:br/     mount_smbfs: URL parsing failed, please correct the URL and try again: Invalid argument    16384   I can confirm it is caused by the Chinese character, because I can execute below command:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codemount_smbfs //user:password@192.168.1.168/hehe /Volumes/picture /code/pre  Both hehe and 图片 are remote shared directories.  <answer171026> Try escaping the unicode  图片 translates as  %E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87 using an escape function I tried &amp; I don't know how well it copes with Chinese character, so you might need to find a smarter one. [not generally-accessible resource, so I can't publish it here.]  The app UnicodeChecker installs a service which can convert any unicode character string into percent escapes.  emEdit:/em I tested against one I found online http://www.url-encode-decode.com which agrees with the above encoding.  See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/912811/what-is-the-proper-way-to-url-encode-unicode-characters for a reference.  <comment201363> Thank you both. It works. The Chinese characters should be encoded before sent. It can also be done by python command urllib.parse.quote('图片')
