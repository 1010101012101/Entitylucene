Why does Mountain Lion ask me for my password when trying to SSH even though I have setup public/private keys? <body> On Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) I have setup public/private keys for passwordless SSH to another Mountain Lion machine but when I try to SSH to the other machine it still asks for my password. I have verified permissions of the code~/.ssh/code directory and the code~/.ssh/authorized_keys2/code file are correct. Verbose output from codessh -vvv my.server.com/code does not show any type of failure and there is nothing indicating a failure in the code/var/log/system.log/code.  My keys work fine when connecting to Linux and Mac OS X Lion (10.7) machines.  <answer84085> In Mountain Lion the codesshd/code configuration (code/etc/sshd_config/code) was changed and codesshd/code no longer looks at code~/.ssh/authorized_keys2/code for valid keys.  code/etc/sshd_config/code on Lion (line 46):  precode#AuthorizedKeysFile     .ssh/authorized_keys /code/pre  code/etc/sshd_config/code on Mountain Lion (line 48):  precode# The default is to check both .ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/authorized_keys2 # but this is overridden so installations will only check .ssh/authorized_keys AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys /code/pre  If you donâ€™t wish to edit the code/etc/sshd_config/code on the target machine you can either rename code~/.ssh/authorized_keys2/code to code~/.ssh/authorized_keys/code or symlink it.  h3Symlink code~/.ssh/authorized_keys/code to code~/.ssh/authorized_keys2/code/h3  precodeln -s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 /code/pre  h3Rename code~/.ssh/authorized_keys2/code/h3  precodemv ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /code/pre
