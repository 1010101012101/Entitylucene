How run a .py (python?)-script in Xcode? <body> Hi I got the complete code, but I don't know how to run the script. The script is some plot of a function, can one run the script so that the plot is shown in xcode?  <answer131379> You don't need to use Xcode. Just open Terminal and run:  precodepython /path/to/file.py /code/pre  <comment154298> What do you mean with "show in Xcode"? If you want to just show the console output of the script, can you run it in Terminal instead? <comment154305> OK I'll try that. Wow awesome it worked, thanks.
