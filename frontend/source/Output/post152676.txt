Macbook waking harddrives when i walk near it <body> This might be hard for some to believe but i swear it is a fact.  I purchased a brand new MBP Mid 2014, 2.8 Ghz 1TB 16GB. Works well.   I have a few external drives connected to it. When i put the MBP to sleep, so go the drives. However, when i move close to the MacBook (as in, walk close to it when it is asleep) the harddrives wake up. They go down again after 30 seconds or so.  When this first happened i thought i was going mad, so i tried it a few times. It is perfectly repeatable and i guarantee i don't touch anything, not the MacBook nor the external bluetooth keyboard or trackpad. Nothing.   What is going on here and why is this happening?  I run Yosemite with Powernap strongdisabled/strong!  <comment179732> Just speculation; it could be a new, undocumented feature with continuity to allow for faster switch on times when near your PC? <comment179740> I will test this later on and see if this is done through the camera or if there is any other motion detection. I'll also check the logs if i find anything. <comment179742> If you had your phone with you when it happened, try it with your phone switched off, or put it in another room. Would be interesting if it is a new Bluetooth LE feature or something.
