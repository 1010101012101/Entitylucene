How to tell what time I sent a text? <body> Is there any way to find out when exactly an un-timestamped chat was sent?  My friend Max swears I didn't promptly inform him of my whereabouts this past weekend. I remember the exchange differently.   A  screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lMMkz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to know for sure?   (I am using iOS 6 on an iPhone 4S.)  <answer69348> One way of doing this:  Delete the texts above the un-timestamped text until the relevant message is assigned a timestamp. In this case you will just have to delete one message.  <comment80589> This worked. Thanks! <comment80620> If the text you're curious about is the most recent in the conversation, go back to your list of texts and it'll show the exact minute. I realize that's not the case here but it can be handy.
