SQLite frontend for OS X? <body> I am looking for a preferably free SQLite frontend to use under OS X.   Something similar to MySQL Workbench will do. Put separate suggestions in separate answers.   <answer15331> strongSQLite Manager Firefox Add-on/strong  Not native OS X app, but it will do the work!  <answer15332> strongDB Browser for SQLite/strong     DB Browser for SQLite is a light GUI   editor for SQLite databases, built on   top of Qt. The main goal of the   project is to allow non-technical   users to create, modify and edit   SQLite databases using a set of   wizards and a spreadsheet-like   interface.   <answer15333> There are also the Navicat brand of SQL editors, including Navicat for SQLite, which are available in the Mac App Store (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navicat-for-sqlite/id424161923?mt=12).  I've not used their SQLite tool, but have used their MySQL product, and found it to work well for most tasks.  <answer15334> h3Navicat SQLite ($49/$99)/h3  Navicat for SQLite is a powerful Database administration and development tool for SQLite. It works with SQLite version 2 and 3 and supports most of the SQLite features including Trigger, Index, View, and so on.  It's a good product but IMHO expensive.  <answer15347> It's a far cry from the other graphical tools mentioned here, but I've found that I prefer interacting with my SQLite databases with the built-in command line tool, strongsqlite3/strong:  precode$ sqlite3 test.db SQLite version 3.6.12 Enter ".help" for instructions Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";" sqlite&gt; create table test (a, b); sqlite&gt; insert into test values (2, 3); sqlite&gt; insert into test values (4, 3); sqlite&gt; insert into test values (4, 5); sqlite&gt; select * from test where a&lt;b; 2|3 4|5 sqlite&gt; .schema CREATE TABLE test (a, b); /code/pre  The best part is that it's built into Mac OS X and is completely, 100% free. (No seriously, the code is in the empublic domain/em)  <answer15353> h3Base ($32.99 USD / Â£19.99)/h3  Native OSX app for interacting with SQLite databases. Base isn't free, but I've found it to be useful. You can buy it through the Mac App Store.  <answer77304> You may like my app SQLPro for SQLite (App Store).  Some of the neat features it includes are:  ul liSyntax highlighting &amp; Autocomplete (sometimes called intellisense)./li liCustomizable themes allowing the query editor to be completely customized./li liThe ability to run multiple queries at one time (and a customizable run query shortcut)./li liPrimary key detection in the query results. When primary keys are detected you can update results &amp; delete rows directly from the grid./li liErrors in queries will be underlined./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/La8ld.png" alt="SQLPro for SQLite screenshot 1"  There is a full schema designer. SQLPro for SQLite allows you to add/update/delete:  ul liTables/li liIndexes/li liForeign Keys and/li liTriggers/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WWNpg.png" alt="Column designer" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3bEl.png" alt="Foreign key designer" In addition:  ul liTables can be imported &amp; exported from/as CSV, XML or JSON./li liA query history browser so that you may see queries run in the past./li liFavourite queries can be stored and reused./li liThe results grid can be searched (either via the Cmd - F keyboard shortcut or by right clicking the results grid and choosing find)./li /ul  There is a seven day trial available via the website.

It is FREE. Works on Mac, Win and Linux. Includes not only db management but powerfull reports that work again on 3 OS.  <comment16659> I'll second this. I use it and it works as advertised, plus it's free. <comment16708> It seems that everything is integrated into Firefox these days. That's a really weird use of a browser, IMO. Completely different from something such as phpSqLite. <comment100056> There is a similar questions on StackOverflow [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100959/mac-sqlite-editor/14228275#14228275). You might find some additional answers. <comment104974> Please have a look at the [faq], especially the part about self-promotion. As there is no "best" tool for everybody, could you also add a list of unique features your tool has? <comment114576> Facepalm. It took me an hour of searching to find out it was already installed on my machine. <comment140856> It's free! And I find it is better SQLite Database browser in providing copy/edit usability, colour for readability, and sidebars for quick access. The only downside that it has from SQLite Database browser is that it requires Firefox. <comment221719> The project has moved to GitHub -- the new link is [https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser). <comment221964> @GordonDavisson Thanks, I will update the link <comment279419> This is a good software, but having just one query window is somewhat limiting... I need different query window for the same db.
