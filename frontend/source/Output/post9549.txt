Share links (url) between iPads? <body> Is there any easy way to share links between iPads?  For example, if my friend is looking at something interesting and wants to send it to me.  Is email still the best way?  <answer9555> Device-to-Device, only e-mail, or chat software you may both be connected to would be the quickest, non-invasive way.  <answer9570> Email is probably the best option. Or you could use a social network site. Something like  Facebook is pretty good for stuff like that...  <answer9615> Yes, e-mail. There is actually no easier way on iOS.  But I'd advise setting up something like Yahoo Pipe or Twitter Mail so you can send a Carbon Copy to twitter, digg, delicious (all of which are good ways to share links) and / or google bookmarks to be able to choose to have your link into some kind of bookmarking other than private e-mails.  <answer29757> iMessage in iOS5 is a great alternative to email as you don't have to mess with a subject and it pushes the link quite rapidly to another iOS device.   Settings - Messages - iMessage (On)  <comment10234> There is kind of an easier way on iOS, but not on iPad 1, and it needs preparation.   One side needs an iOS device with a camera, with the app RedLaser (or other QR code reading app). The other side needs an iOS device with this bookmarklet installed in Safari: http://code.google.com/p/qrbookmarklet/   Then the person reading the interesting article clicks the bookmark and a QR code of the URL pops up, and the other person scans the QR code in RedLaser which opens Safari with to that page.  Two touches for the person with the article, three for the other, no email. <comment10276> Since when chat is less invasive than email? O_o <comment10277> @Tessallating I don't consider it easier needing a line of view and pointing to the device in the proper way. And he never said his friend is close by. I might want to share links with my friend in another country. But that's an interesting idea anyway. :P I still find the best way for doing it while nearby would be something like bonjour / bluetooth show devices nearby and send. But it would need to be integrated with the browser and to do it with safari jailbreak is needed, which breaks the "easy" part again. <comment10281> I wasn't really making a claim regarding E-mail vs Chat. More E-mail/Chat  Most Other Methods. (Things like Prowl, Boxcar, etc. Externally generated notifications.) <comment34256> I wish I could move the accepted answer to qthrul's. His is quite obviously much more correct as of the release of iOS 5. <comment34349> that sounds like a good idea to suggest on meta. Some way to deal with orphan questions.
