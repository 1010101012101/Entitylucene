Browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) routes to incorrect server for domain <body> I purchased a new domain for my website at Hover.com. I pointed the name servers to my host provider. Everything works smoothly when I access the site on my iPhone, iPad, on my roommate's laptop, or any other machine.  But on my MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion, when I try to load my website at the new domain, I'm directed to a Hover.com landing page. The old domain (which I still have pointed to the same place) works fine, but the new one does not, and it's only on my machine that I have this problem. Changing browsers does not help. I tried clearing the DNS cache like so  precodesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  but that does not fix the problem. Any ideas? My new domain name is andrewphilipclark.com.  <answer82274> The problem resolved itself... somehow. I guess somewhere between my MacBook and my server there was a DNS cache that needed to be cleared. Kinda wished I knew what the issue was so I could learn from it, but oh well.  <comment94830> Cached DNS lookups on the MacBook? <comment94849> Doesn't the command I posted flush the DNS cache? I don't know much about this stuff.
