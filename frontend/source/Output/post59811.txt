Strange Issue with "Recent" Stacks in Mountain Lion <body> After my recent upgrade to Mountain Lion I accidentally dragged the "Recent Applications" stack off the dock and it "poofed" away... not that big a deal, I just went into Terminal and used the following command     defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{ "tile-data" = { "list-type" = 1; }; "tile-type" = "recents-tile"; }'   followed by resetting the dock with      killall Dock      exit   Then emptied the trash, shut down, and reboot for good measure...  A space for the Recent Apps is now present on the dock, but it doesn't contain anything, no matter how many apps I open.  It is right clickable to get the context menu. The same is true no matter which kind of "Recent" stack is selected.  If selected the Favorite Volumes or Favorite Items stacks work normally.    Looking through the Library there is no recent items plist.  What's my next step?  <answer60179> Issue solved:  After the update the Recent Items selection in System PreferencesGeneral was set to 0.    <answer60717> when I open quicktime, pictures, texedit or word docs  at least 10 previous files open up at the same time this is really confusing and annoying  although recent items is set to none  why does mountain lion have the same bugs as the first versions of lion  why did apple even add these silly windows features ...  <comment69907> I haven't had that issue... Is the "Close windows when quitting an application" option checked in the System PreferencesGeneral menu?
