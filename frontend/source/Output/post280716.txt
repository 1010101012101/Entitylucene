Find devices informations (/dev path, ...) and debug usb devices in CLI <body> I recently moved from Linux to Mac OS, and I'm quite a bit lost in some situations.  I'm looking for the /dev name of my USB device (which is listed in the system_profiler SPUSBDataType).  On Linux I used to use dmesg or lsusb to find information about my devices. The Mac OS emdmesg/em command is just useless, and the syslog (even in debug mode) does not say anything about the plugged USB devices.  ul liIs there any way to monitor in real time (like dmesg -w with Linux) the plugged devices on Mac ?/li /ul  I found the emsystem_profiler SPUSBDataType/em, but this command does not help me to find the /dev id of my device.  ul liIs there an easy way to find the /dev name of (plugged) with Mac ? /li /ul  The only way I found for now is to do one emls /dev/em before the device plug-in and one after, and diff them...   ul liAnd finally if I have to debug an USB device like "why it is not recognized on the system ? where is the problem ? how can I fix it ?" what are the commands I dispose of ?/li /ul  On Linux I used to use dmesg/lsusb/lspci/syslog...  <comment353217> You're not alone in feeling lost - I remember coming to OS X from Solaris and to a lesser extent Linux.
