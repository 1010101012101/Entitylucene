Change color of balloons and text in Message.app <body> In previous versions of Message.app bundled with Mac OS X, we could change the font and color of the message balloons. In Yosemite I no longer can find such options.   Am I simply failing to find the options? Is such customizing no longer allowed? If not allowed, is there any easy hacking tricks to get the same effect?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sDmcK.png" alt="screen shot of Messages.app"  <answer206263> In OSX Yosemite colors are blue (for iMessages) and green (for SMS). There is no longer the ability to change these; Macs now look like iOS devices.  strongHard way: (backup first!)/strong  For Yosemite modify CSS here:  precode/System/Library/Messages/PlugIns/Balloons.transcriptstyle/Contents/Resources/balloons-modern.css /code/pre  For El Captain it's now located in:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SocialUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources /code/pre  But one needs to either disable rootless mode or to use a union file system mount to map the file over without rootless.  Hope this will help.  <answer228572> There is a way to do this!! You have to go into Accessibility options, Reduce Transparency, and then the options are back in the Messages preferences pane.
