Creating a Windows 8 bootable usb on Mac 10.6.8 without BootCamp? <body> I'm running 10.6.8 and when I try to use BootCamp, it tells me I need "at least 10GB of free space", which is interesting since I have 21GB of free space. However, trying to fix this issue has seemed pointless at this rate and I remember there used to be way to create bootable USBs using only Disk Utility during the Vista era. I had tried converting my code.iso/code to code.dmg/code and mounting them and 'burning' them to the flash drive, but nothing has seemed to work. All the tutorials I have found online use BootCamp, which is what I want to stay away from since it does not work for me.  So is there a way to do this? And what is the recommended file type code.iso/code, code.img/code, or code.dmg/code to be used? Should it be mounted or unmounted when I try to 'burn' it?  <answer168106> UPDATE: Graham try using this answer: Creating A Bootable USB Of Windows 8.1 On OS X?  hr  You state your mac book is from late 2011. Apple did not make mac books in 2011. They did make mac book pro 13", 15" and 17" models in late 2011. The 13" has a 2.4 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 or a 2.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i7. The 15" has 2.2, 2.4, or 2.5GHz quad-core Intel Core i7. The 17" has 2.4 or 2.5 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7. All size came with 4GB of RAM memory. You claim yours is a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with only 2 GB of RAM. This does not match. All these models were shipped with OS X Lion, so why do you have Snow Leopard installed on your Mac.  I need to know if you are currently running any version of windows on your computer. If so, can you run the upgrade advisor from Microsoft. Is Windows 8 an upgrade iso or the full version. Do you have a way to backup your mac. Have you downloaded the window drivers for your mac yet. I would still like to get the serial number of your mac or the Model identifier. I also assume you have the windows product key to go with the iso image.  I can tell you this much. I am running a Mid 2007 iMac with 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 4 GB of RAM. I have Yosemite OS X 10.10.1 and Windows 8.1 x64 Pro installed. Both run just fine. The only problem I encountered was that windows was not able to correctly read the HFS+ OS X partitions. Apple does not officially support Windows 8.1 for my iMac so this failure does not bother me.  If you can provide sufficient information about your model Mac, I probably could give you an installation procedure. Or, tell you not to bother.  <answer190868> Follow the instructions here on creating a bootable USB from a Windows ISO file:  http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/2fy3be/by_popular_demand_my_better_than_bootcamp_guide/  Unfortunately, I'm having difficulty finding the original tutorial I used to install Windows 8.1 on a partition on my Mid 2009 MacBook Pro, but here is a similar write-up:  http://huguesval.com/blog/2012/02/installing-windows-7-on-a-mac-without-superdrive-with-virtualbox/  Note: This works with the Windows 8.1 Enterprise Trial, which can later be upgraded to a retail copy.  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-8-1-enterprise  <answer206249> Have you tried using the cross-platform application called em"unetbootin"/em?  strongCorrect me if I'm wrong/strong, but I've been using this method for the past year and a half, and it works quite well.

I tried something new now and I keep getting "Could not validate source - error 254", with no idea how to fix that now. However, I thinking fixing my new issue would actually allow me to create the fully bootable usb. <comment197132> Are you creating the USB in Bootcamp? It won't work otherwise… that's why the error 254 <comment197148> @Tetsujin: Actually you can run windows 8.1 on macs older than 2011. My iMac is Mid 2007 and is running windows 8.1 without a problem. [See screen shot of desktop](http://greatwesternimaging.com/imacmid2007.png). <comment197149> No, I am creating it in Disk Utility. Is it for certain that it can only be done in BootCamp? I had done this before with a copy of Windows Vista a few years ago using only Disk Utility and it had worked. <comment197154> Is there a reason you don't upgrade from OS X 10.6.8 to OS X 10.10.1. It appears the upgrade is free. It should make installing windows 8 simpler. Also, do you have a machine available running windows? If so, which version. <comment197161> @DavidAnderson I feel my MacBook Pro in its current state is not physically equipped with the right hardware to be able to support 10.10.1. I have 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with only 2 GB of RAM (which I was just on Amazon looking a few minutes ago looking to upgrade my RAM cards). I know talking about my specs in this thread are a bit unrelated but I would not mind hearing your opinion on whether you think my specs are suitable for an upgrade like Yosemite? <comment197162> I believe the highest I can upgrade without encountering hardware compatibility issues is 10.7.X Lion if I am not mistaken. <comment197170> I am a bit confused. Much of what you say does not fit. How about this. Click on the apple icon at the top left of the screen. Select "About this Mac". In the pop up window there will be a string: "Version 10.6.8". Click on that string twice and the serial number should appear. Give me the serial number. <comment197171> Here you go: Build 10K549. <comment197178> You have to click on the "Version 10.6.8" 2 times to get the serial number. You only clicked 1 time. The first click is the Build. The second click will be the serial number. <comment197638> See my updated answer.
