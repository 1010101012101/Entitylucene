What different Stack Exchange apps exist for iOS? <body> How do you access apple.stackexchange.com from your iOS devices?  What apps do you use and what is good/bad about them?  <answer12419> I currently use SixToEight by Adam Wright (App Store Link).  It's missing push notifications right now but will eventually be included as a in app purchase.  For push notifications I'm using Prowl to forward Growl messages from Newt.  <answer38894> There are several different apps available for iOS.  h2SOStacked (on Stack Apps, on the App Store)/h2  This app allows you to browse all the Stack Exchange sites on your iOS device.

Enjoy.  <comment12961> Ooh - a meta question that's so meta it wraps back to be a good iOS usage question. <comment117194> Could somebody point out the reasons why (other than use of APIs to potentially reduce network bandwidth) these would be superior to accessing the website through mobileSafari? <comment152607> Up voted via the official app just to add to the meta that is this whole question to begin with. <comment152619> @IanC. Replied via the official *Android* app. :) <comment153952> @StevenLu The layout will be optimized for usage on an iPhone for example rather than using a desktop website on a mobile device.
