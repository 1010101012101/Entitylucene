Can I copy by highlighting and paste by middle click on Mac OS X? <body> I was using Linux for the last couple of years and I find it extremely useful to copy text by highlighting it as well as to paste by clicking a middle mouse button.  I'm using a Mac now and I wonder if I can achieve such behaviour on Mac OS X.  <answer21609> I don't think there is a way in general but some programs will accept the middle button as paste   e.g.  ul liAquamacs - an OSX configured emacs/li liiTerm2 - a replacement for Terminal/li /ul  I suspect there won't be many more as mice now have scroll wheels rather than a middle button.  <answer30860> You can try BetterTouchTool. You can assign custom trackpad, mouse, and keyboard events to trigger specific actions on a global or application-specific basis.  Here's my configuration to bind a three-finger tap to kbd⌘V/kbd (as this is the global paste shortcut. Alternatively you can select from dozens of other trackpad and mouse gestures to emulate the paste command.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E67bA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer39916> After highlighting text in the Terminal, I can middle-click to paste it back into the Terminal without using the copy/paste keyboard shortcuts. This does not seem to work when the text comes from other applications ie. I can't copy text from TextEdit and then paste into Terminal with a middle-click. I am running Lion and I did not have configure anything to get this default behavior. I'm not sure about other versions of OS X.  <answer40896> Create the following Automator service: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UUOI2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Assign it a keystroke, like kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdcontrol/kbdkbd]/kbd (something unlikely to conflict with anything). Then, use BetterTouchTool to assign that keystroke to the middle mouse button.  The middle shell script comes from this fine answer. The first shell script copies the selection to the clipboard, the middle script clicks the mouse at its current location, and the AppleScript sends a kbd⌘/kbdkbdV/kbd to paste the contents of the clipboard  <answer208091> I tried the Automator script suggested by Daniel. It did NOT work for me on OS X 10.10.  I was able to make BetterTouchTool (v 1.15), alone, work for some applications. Like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9eKc3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I did Left Mouse twice for several reasons. The first one usually only changes the focus to the new window, but does not position the cursor. Also, clicking in a text box usually selects all of the text, which is then deleted when something is pasted there. I usually want the original text to stay.  Gilligan  <answer241753> I wrote a free little C program that does something similar to Gilligan's answer. Whenever you drag-highlight or double-click text, it copies to the clipboard buffer. Then you can middle-mouse-click in any window to paste it. It is called "macpaste" and on github (https://github.com/rsmz/macpaste). It works globally for every program I use that has textual data.  In iTerm2, disable their middle-click in Preferences, otherwise you'll get double pastes.  <answer274210> The macOS terminal can do copy/paste with two separate buffers:  ol liThe copy/paste buffer which is shared with all other applications. It can be accessed by kbdCommand/kbdkbdC/kbd/kbdCommand/kbdkbdV/kbd./li liA separate copy/past buffer which is shared only between (macOS) terminals. It can be filled (copy) by dragging over the text by mouse, double clicking, or kbdShift/kbdkbdCommand/kbd double-clicking for file names (no kbdCommand/kbdkbdV/kbd). The content of this buffer is pasted by the middle mouse button, by kbdShift/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdV/kbd, or by kbdCommand/kbd + two-finger-click./li /ol  <answer287315> Select Text to be copied, then Drag and Drop your selection (White Plus sign in red circle will be displayed with the cursor). This will copy-paste the text.brbr You can Drag and Drop inside Terminal or between apps.  <comment23915> scroll wheel = middle button (it is clickable on most of mouses nowadays). <comment35441> FWIW this only solves the middle-click; I don't believe its possible to auto-copy highlighted text without an additional command. (Except for apps that specifically provide the feature, like iTerm2) <comment205801> And has anyone come up with a reasonable solution for that so far? I miss my select-wheelpaste SO MUCH!!! <comment300297> This is AWESOME! So close. If it only had a separate buffer to hold the highlighted text separately from normally copied text it would be almost as close to Linux as possible. Nice job <comment305459> This is exactly what I was looking for :-) Thank you so much for sharing! <comment307681> This is crazy that you cannot get this behavior in the built in terminal between windows....ahhh i miss linux. <comment309801> This works, however it unfortunately messes up with chrome/firefox/safari/anybrowser middle-click-link to open in new tab. Any way to get around this? <comment355512> I cannot believe OSX does not do this  ... linux rocks in so many ways <comment360279> Doesn't compile for me - `Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64` <comment369835> Cool! I've added below in my .bashrc and it works fine (xterm is only where I miss it):     case "$(ps -ef | grep macpaste | grep -v "grep" | wc -l)" in          0)  ~/bin/macpaste/macpaste  /dev/null &         ;;     1)  # all ok         ;;     *)  kill -9 $(pgrep macpaste)         ~/bin/macpaste/macpaste  /dev/null &         ;;     esac  The only one sad thing that I don't have middle button on my MM2 and don't want to setup that thirdparty stuff... Thanks @remik ! <comment373986> This would be so great if it would not beep on almost every click.
