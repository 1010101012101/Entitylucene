What color space is iPhone's 7 "Wide color display (P3)" <body> Newest iPhone 7 claims to have "Wide color display (P3)". What exactly is this, a color space? Could this be Adobe RGB, or just a different space created by apple?  How does it compare to sRBG and Adobe RBG?  <answer252161> Ok I've found it. It's DCI-P3 standard:  http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/09/09/apples-wide-color-screen-on-the-iphone-7-will-lead-to-more-faithful-color-reproduction  Most modern android smartphones are already able to display the circle inside the red square, but probably are converting Adobe RGB or DCI-P3 color space to sRBG instead of displaying correctly the original one.

Software that processes photos or videos needs to account for this difference; otherwise colors will come out wrong.  However, Display P3 has the same gamut as DCI-P3, so at a high level, you can think of them as the same thing.  <comment321977> I think you have that backwards, DCI-P3 uses gamma 2.6 while Apple uses 2.2. <comment322952> Indeed, thanks for pointing it out, corrected now.
