iPhone app switching, memory, reloading, losing data - why? <body> I often find myself in the middle of doing something in an app, then needing to find something relevant in another app and when I switch back, the app I was working in reloads and I've lost the data.  For example, composing a message in Facebook.app, then switching to YouTube.app to search for a link I want to put in the FB message, but, when I go back to the Facebook.app, the FB.app reloads and I have lost what I was composing.  This seems like it could just be a poor app design (i.e. SE on the desktop remembers if I have started composing something), however, it also seems like iOS just dumps whatever an app was doing if it is not active for a certain period.  What governs this behavior? It doesn't seem to be a strict "time limit" and it partially seems connected to whether or not the app in question has access to the speakers. ?.  Apologies if this has been asked before but the questions I've searched here are specific to browsers. For what it is worth, I am using an older model 4S with iOS 9.3.5 but this has been a behavior I have struggled with since I first started using the iPhone (maybe iOS5ish?) If it is no longer an issue with newer models which support the latest OS I might consider upgrading, but it seems almost nefariously contrived to maximize downloading data bandwidth.  What is going on with how the iOS handles non-active app memory? Thanks!
