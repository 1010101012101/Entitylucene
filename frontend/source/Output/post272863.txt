How can I use the fn key as a standalone key on my Mac? <body> I want to use the kbdfn/kbd key on my keyboard as a trigger for an AppleScript (.scpt file) via FastScripts.  The reason that I want to do this is because the kbdfn/kbd key is occupying coveted real estate on the keyboard, and I don't think I've once used a kbdfn/kbd key shortcut in my life.  I installed Karabiner and went through every option under the em"Change Fn key"/em and em"Fn To All Modifiers Mode"/em categories individually, to see if FastScripts would be able to pick up on me pressing the kbdfn/kbd key and thus allow me to assign the kbdfn/kbd key as a script shortcut.  ul liFastScripts was able to pick up my keypress when the em"Fn to F14"/em option in Karabiner was selected. But, F14 is apparently already in use, because when I pressed the key, my screen brightness setting decreased a notch, which is obviously undesirable./li liFastScripts was also able to pick up my keypress when the em"Fn 2x to F19"/em option in Karabiner was selected. But, this obviously requires me to press the kbdfn/kbd key, twice in order to start the script. This is also undesirable. /li /ul  These were the only two Karabiner options that FastScripts was able to perceive.  I am not particularly wedded to using any application in particular (e.g., Karabiner) to accomplish this.  subOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. /sub  <answer272887> You can stop kbdF14/kbd from changing the brightness in System Preferences.  Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Display, and untick "Decrease display brightness":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KWOZc.png" alt="System Preferences window"  Any integrated brightness keys on your keyboard will continue to function.   <comment343042> I do not have a "Display" category in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts.

This leads me to conclude that this category is only shown when an external keyboard is connected to the computer. I was then able to deselect the F14 shortcut, as you demonstrated in your answer. The "Display" category disappeared when I turned off the wireless keyboard, but, fortunately, the off setting for the F14 shortcut is saved.
