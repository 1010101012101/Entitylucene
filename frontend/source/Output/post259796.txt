macOS Sierra 10.12: Configure firewall for a single port (3690) <body> How can one configure the Firewall on macOS Sierra 10.12 to open up a single port (in this case port 3690)?  There's no obvious UI to do this.  <answer259811> If you are using Sierra's Application Firewall you can't restrict it to a single port.  To allow incoming traffic for a specific binary, open System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  Firewall  Firewall Options and either hit the plus button and choose the binary or drop the binary from a Finder window.  In my example below I have chosen the X11 binary in /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/syuFi.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can the check additional apps added by executing:  precodesudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --listapps /code/pre  hr  After adding Xcode, anything starting with svn in /usr/bin/ and /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/ and starting /usr/bin/svnserve I was asked emonce/em to allow incoming traffic for svnserve (I don't know which of both svnserve executables) and it worked from remote. After removing everything and repeating the same steps it failed again.  The log file at /var/log stays empty and the other logs don't reveal anything related to blocked incoming connections.  I recommend to enable ssh and create a ssh:svn-tunnel. Link: Subversion through a tunnel  hr  As an alternative install Murus - a GUI for empf/em. If you don't activate it with an email and a serial number it will run as the free emMurus Lite/em.  Open the app and choose a strategy. E.g. Novice  Predefined Firewall Configuration Presets  Almost all services blocked. Then activate the selected Murus preset and start pf.  Hit the library button. In the services library panel hit the gear   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ssew.png" alt="add custom service"  and add a new custom service SVN:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/av5LG.png" alt="SVN service"  In the groups library hit the gear and add new custom group  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PbGL2.png" alt="add custom group"  Hit the loupe, enter a group name, add an appropriate interface, hit the plus button and add an IP or network.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oL3QW.png" alt="configure custom group"  Drag the SVN service to the main windows (Managed inbound services) and configure it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ed4dn.png" alt="Managed inbound services"  If you have additional services like SSH running, add them also. Start or restart pf if necessary. Now - protected by empf/em - you may dissable the application firewall.  <comment325076> Which firewall do you want to configure: application firewall or pf? <comment325079> TBH,  don't know - just know that Subversion (port 3690) works when the firewall's turned off,  but doesn't when it's on.  Am running svnshare for some code running in a VMWare VM on this machine (question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259633/macos-sierra-configuring-subversion-svn-on-apache) <comment325096> Can/does the packet filter work in conjunction with the firewall?  i.e. adding a specific port to that using pfctl? <comment325099> Tried adding `svnserve` but it's still blocked (e.g. try to connect, can't,  turn off firewall, connect, works).  `/usr/bin/svnserve ( Allow incoming connections )` <comment325110> There's also one in `(whereis svnserve)`  `/usr/bin/svnserve` - and thanks.  I'm developing .net applications in Visual Studio within a VMWare VM on "my" machine,  hence just need to connect from the VM to the host.  Currently that's on the 172.16.x.x address range <comment325120> OIC - all about 18k.  Killed `svnserve` and started the Xcode version (`ps` shows `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svnserve -d -r /Users/GlennG/svnRepo`). Added this to the firewall `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svnserve ( Allow incoming connections )`.  Again same issue: doesn't work from the VM using Tortoise,  turn off Mac firewall then it works. <comment325167> @GlennG I would like to rant about Apple, Sierra and the flawed log system now, but I probably would be banned or the comment would be flagged as inappropriate. I can comprehend your problems but I can't find any log nor log entry in the whole system (ASL/log/new log database) and I don't really know what's blocked.
