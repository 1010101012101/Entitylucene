Calendar that's accessible from Mac OS X and Linux <body> Does anyone know of any calendar software/approach, so that I can use my calendar from both Mac OS X and from Linux?  I use both Mac OS X and Linux regularly, and I'd like to be able to both view and edit my calendar from both platforms.  Does anyone know of any solutions?  I don't want to have to use a web browser to access my calendar.  Also, I'm trying to avoid Google/Gmail.  (Maybe there's a way to host a calendar in iCloud or MobileMe and use it from both Mac OS X and Linux?  Or maybe some open-source program that I can compile on both Mac OS X and Linux, and that hosts the data on a server I administer?  Or something?  Any ideas, anyone?)  <answer74052> I assume that you don't refer to a dual boot Mac OS and Linux machine, where only one OS is running at a time. Sharing a calendar between different platforms means that you have to put the information on the network/internet.   For that you should have a look at the CalDAV standard, which is an extension of the WebDAV file sharing protocol. The Wikipedia article lists CalDAV server software (e.g. an Apache httpd module) as well as a couple of existing CalDAV services.  <answer140571> The following solution is clumsy in that it uses discontinued software (Mozilla Sunbird), but works for strongdual boots/strong, or any situation where both OSes have access to a common partition. The idea is to install Sunbird 0.9 (the last stable version) on both Mac OS X and Linux and have a common profile folder as is customary for Firefox and Thunderbird. The obvious thing to do would instead be to set up Thunderbird on both sides with a common profile folder and install Lightning. However, the Lightning plugin has a Mac and a Linux version, and is installed strongin/strong the profile folder, so you would end up using the Mac version in Linux or vice versa, which doesn't work. There seem to be workarounds, but I haven't found any understandable one.  I think this solution is relatively safe: Sunbird is closely related to Lightning, so it should be easy to move to Lightning when it solves this issue or when you no longer need a shared profile folder.  In Mac OS X:  ul liInstall Sunbird 0.9, for example from this place./li liOpen and close Sunbird so that your computer realizes it's there and removes the application-downloaded-from-the-internet safety measure./li liOpen a terminal (Applications  Utilities  Terminal)/li liType code/Applications/Sunbird.app/Contents/MacOS/sunbird-bin -p/code. This opens the Sunbird profile manager./li liClick "Create Profile...", then "Next" to get past the info screen./li liGive the profile a name of your choice./li liClick "Choose Folder..." and pick a folder that is accessible for both OSes, say codeSharedPartition/SunbirdProfileFolder/code/li liClick "Finish". Select the new profile, and click "Start Sunbird" to make sure the new profile is set to default. You can quit Sunbird right away./li /ul  In Linux (Sunbird is probably no longer available from any software centers, so we will have to do it manually. I will follow this guide with a few tweaks based on my own experience):  ul liInstall the package codelibstdc++5/code, e.g. through a software center./li liChange the name of the profile folder you created in OS X, say to codeSharedPartition/SunbirdProfileFolder_MovedAside/code. Create a new folder called codeSharedPartition/SunbirdProfileFolder/code/li liDownload a tarball for Sunbird 0.9. Best search the web for "Download codesunbird-0.9.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz/code"  ul liIf you have a 64-bit processor, either look for a 64-bit tarball or install the package codeia32-libs/code, e.g. through a software center./li /ul/li liOpen a terminal. Every time, type the given command. When in doubt, use codeman theUsedCommand/code for more info on what you're doing.  ul licodesudo bash/code This gives you root permission (including the permission to mess up your system entirely)./li licodecp -t /usr/lib ~/Downloads/sunbird-0.9.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz/code (Replace code~/Downloads/code with the path to your download folder.) This copies the tarball to code/usr/lib/code./li licodecd /usr/lib/code to go there yourself./li licodetar -xvf sunbird-0.9.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz/code to unpack the tarball. A folder code/usr/lib/sunbird/code is created./li licodechown -R root:root /usr/lib/sunbird//code to set the owner of this folder to root./li licodegedit /usr/bin/sunbird/code This opens a text editor showing an empty file. Paste  precode#!/bin/sh cd /usr/lib/sunbird/ ./sunbird /code/pre  Save and close./li licodechmod +x /usr/bin/sunbird/code Make the file executable./li licodegedit /usr/share/applications/sunbird.desktop/code This opens another empty file in a text editor. Paste  precode[Desktop Entry] Name=Sunbird Comment=Calendar Application Exec=sunbird Icon=/usr/lib/sunbird/chrome/icons/default/default.xpm Terminal=false Type=Application Categories=Application;Office; /code/pre  Save and close. /li licodeexit/code Ends root permissions. Close and reopen the terminal./li licodewhich sunbird/code This tells you where Sunbird is located. It should answer code/usr/bin/sunbird/code/li licode/usr/lib/sunbird/sunbird -P/code This launches the Sunbird profile manager.  ul liClick "Create Profile...", then "Next" to get past the info screen./li liGive the profile a name of your choice./li liClick "Choose Folder..." and pick the strongoriginal/strong codeSharedPartition/SunbirdProfileFolder/code, strongnot/strong the renamed one./li liClick "Finish". Select the new profile, and click "Start Sunbird" to make sure the new profile is set to default. You can quit Sunbird right away./li /ul/li /ul/li liErase the folder codeSharedPartition/SunbirdProfileFolder/code which now contains a new profile; rename codeSharedPartition/SunbirdProfileFolder_MovedAside/code to codeSharedPartition/SunbirdProfileFolder/code. You now have Sunbird on Mac OS X and Linux, sharing the same profile, including calendars, settings etc./li /ul  If you're on Ubuntu, you can go to code/usr/share/applicatons/code in the file browser and drag the Sunbird icon into the launcher.  <comment86078> Right, two separate machines, not a dual-boot Mac OS/Linux machine.  Thank you for the information, bhell!
