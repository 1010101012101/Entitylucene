launching automator with keywords <body> Using codeautomator/code, I would like to launch some webpages as soon as I type some keywords in any application. Is that possible ?   <answer180210> Yes. This is able to be done with Automator in a number of ways. One of many ways to do this is to create a service in Automator and then set the keyboard shortcut using System Preferences. In Automator, one would simply create a service and set: Service receives codeno input/code in codeany application/code, then add codeGet Specified URLs/code(and specify the webpages you want to open), followed by codeDisplay Webpages/code. After saving the service, one would set the keyboard shortcut by opening System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts Services. At the bottom of the page(under 'General'), the service would appear. They would then check the box next to it if it isn't already, and they would click on codeadd shortcut/code(and type the shortcut).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ES00B.png" alt="The Automator Service"
