How do I watch the US presidential debates live via AppleTV? <body> I have a 3rd generation Apple TV. Will it be possible to use it to watch the US presidential debates live? I would prefer to do so without using AirPlay, if possible.  I know that today's (Oct 3, 2012) debate will be streamed live via YouTube. Is the Apple TV's YouTube app capable of showing this? If so, how would I navigate to it?  If AirPlay is my only choice, how can I best go about it? I have:  ul lian iPhone 4S running iOS 5 (capable of both AirPlay for videos and AirPlay Mirroring)/li lia Mac running OS X 10.7 (capable of AirPlay for videos, but not AirPlay mirroring)/li /ul  <answer66230> You'll find the YouTube icon on the Apple TVs home screen. Just click it. If its available you'll find it.  <answer66238> As the link you posted has several Pre-event streams scheduled, you can try things out before hand. I haven't seen a public announcement by either Google or Apple saying to tune in on your Apple TV, so you might plan on a second manner of streaming.   I'll likely use AirPlay mirroring to get the content onto my large screen via Apple TV.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HW0bD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer66244> There is a Wall Street journal app on Apple TV live streaming the debates  <answer66245> The best bet right now seems to be AirPlay via the CNN iPhone App, which seems to provide higher quality than the other things I've tried.  GigaOM has a long list of debate streams. Here's what I've discovered about each one that might have promise:  h1Success/h1  ul listrongCNN/strong: AirPlay via iPhone app. Appears to have the best video quality./li listrongYouTube/strong: AirPlay via the mobile site in iPhone's Safari appears to work! (Confirmed with pre-show live stream). Cannot find stream in any ove AppleTV app, Apple-provided iPhone app, nor YouTube-provided iPhone app./li /ul  h1Might work/h1  ul listrongUstream/strong: AirPlay via the mobie site in iPhone's Safari emwas/em working, is currently unavailable.

I don't know if it *is* being streamed however. <comment77900> Just checked your link - looks like your ATV can do it directly. <comment77905> The pre-show live stream *is* available on YouTube's mobile site, but not their Apple-provided nor YouTube-provided apps for iPhone, nor the YouTube Apple TV app. <comment77911> Is it actually working for you? When I try to launch it, I get an error message that WSJ Live is unavailable.
