How to disable Notification for Terminal app? <body> When i am starting a new server from the Terminal app, and i have the window not active, the Dock icon "jumps" up and down, also called "notifies me".   I don't want this behaviour, i want a quiet Terminal. I know when i am starting and stopping sth.      How can i do that?   strongI've already disabled the audio and visual bell, but still: Jumping./strong  emSystem version: Mavericks./em   <answer121277> Whilst it's not ideal, if it's that bad you could disable the app bounce notification completely for all apps:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codedefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Dock /code/pre  supTo revert, replace codeTRUE/code with codeFALSE/code./sup  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul  <answer121445> Running your commands in gnu screen can solve your problem.  Steps to replicate bad behavior:  ol licode$ sleep 5; tout bel/code/li liCommand-Tab away from Terminal/li liWait/li /ol  Observed behavior: Terminal icon gets badge and bounces  Desired behavior: No badge or bounce  Solution:  ol licode$ screen/code/li liControl+A, c # create a new screen window/li licode$ sleep 5; tput bel/code/li liControl+A, Control+A # switch to screen 0/li liCommand-Tab away from Terminal/li /ol  New observed behavior: No badge or bounce  Note that you'll still get badge + bounce if the screen window is the active one. I'm sure you can refine this further.  <answer188210> If you're just issuing one long-running command that occasionally pops a bell, you could run the command with the output piped to less. This seems to have done the trick for me:  precodeannoyingcmd | less -R /code/pre  (The -R flag allows for colors to be displayed)  <comment141064> I don't think it is possible. I am pretty sure this is something handled by the system and is out of the users hands. <comment141385> Use iTerm2? Not the best answer, hence it's a comment instead.
