Startup iTunes to Shared Library / Home Sharing <body> I've enabled iTunes Home Sharing on 2 Macs, and I want the remote iTunes to start up directly to the shared library instead of the default local library and manually selecting "Shared Library".  Much appreciated.  <answer82642> Unfortunately, you can't do this. THere might be a way to script it, but I doubt that; I don't think Apple wants people to be able to do this.
