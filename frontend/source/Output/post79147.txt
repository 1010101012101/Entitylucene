Move regular calendar items to iCloud <body> When I look at my calendars in the calendar app on the iPhone there are two sections, one reads "From My Mac", the other "iCloud". Is there an app that reads the calendar items from the "From My Mac" calendar items and moves them to similarly named calendars in "iCloud"?  Background: My main computer which I used to sync my calendars via iTunes is broken. Now all my calendar items are on the iPhone only and I'm afraid to sync with my new computer. I want to sync everything via iCloud instead.
