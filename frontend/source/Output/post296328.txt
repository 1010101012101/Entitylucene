How do I stop the icloud pop up prompt asking me to sign in using an old gmail ID? <body> I recently changed my Apple ID from a Gmail address to an Outlook address. Everyplace I have checked shows the new address as my Apple ID. Yet every few minutes I get a icloud login screen showing my old Gmail address as the ID. The address is grayed out so I can't just change it. No matter how many times I close this window it just pops up again a short time later.  <comment374262> Are these two separate IDs, or did you change the primary email address, as in https://support.apple.com/ht202667? <comment374264> Two separate IDs because I am going to close my Gmail account. <comment374273> Then any time you want to use something on your old ID, you are going to have to provide the credentials for it. ... basically, you went the wrong way, you should have changed the primary email instead... Your old ID 'owns' everything, your new ID owns nothing, not even the phone/Mac. <comment374298> Not sure I'm following you. At the time, Gmail was my primary and only email so I'm not understanding what I should have done differently. My main concern is how to stop the icloud login screen from coming up on my desktop regularly. Does your explanation mean there is no way to do that? <comment374300> Also, when I go to my iphone settings it shows the new Outlook email address as my Apple ID and accepts the password I chose for that ID. <comment374327> Everything you 'purchased' [free or paid] on the old ID still belongs to that ID & cannot be transferred. Those credentials will be required any time one of those needs to be updated or modified. You should have changed the primary address, not set up a new ID.
