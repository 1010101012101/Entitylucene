Deleted hash files; can't login anymore! <body> I've deleted the two hash files in the folder /private/var/db/shadow/hash/, corresponding to my login account. Now, I cannot login, and don't have any other account on my Mac with sudo permissions.  Is there a way in which I can reset my password? If not, will it be possible to access data belonging to this account? My other accounts do not have permissions to these folders.  <answer7854> You can boot into the terminal by holding codeCommand + S/code at startup. You could create a new user via command line this way. Here is a tutorial. Another option is to insert the installation disc and reinstall the Mac OS X.  <answer7856> emchanging my comments to an answer since Jon was able to solve it using single-user mode/em  Can you login using single-user mode? hold command-s on startup.
