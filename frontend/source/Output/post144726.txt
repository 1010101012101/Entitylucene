Opensource software versions by OS X distribution <body> Have anyone or know anyone any pointer to strongsome table/strong, where is summarised what versions of some major opensource software was included in different OS X versions?  Like in mavericsk is perl 5.16.2 (relatively new), bash only 3.2.51 (very outdated and really emwondering about yosemite version/em ) and such.  Exists something like distrowatch.com(Linux) for OS X too?  <answer144727> Apple lists all open-source files grouped by OS version on their site: http://opensource.apple.com  <comment170489> It is not like a "table" for easy comparison, but thanx anyway - if nobody has a summarised table - it is a good advice :). +1 <comment170490> As I see - HTML from this site could be easily parsed. When I have more free time, maybe I'll try to write some code. <comment170491> :) Yeah, the easiest way will be fetch the `softwarename.plist` whitch contains the `keyOpenSourceVersion/key` too. Therefore I suspecting than someone already done this. ;)
