Disable Safari Top Sites on Mavericks <body> How can I disable the Top Sites on OS X ver 10.9.5? I have deleted the cache and locked Safari so that new windows images do not get saved.  I know how to Delete but need to know how to Disable the Top Sites in Safari.  <answer157737> In Finder paste following in the Go To Folder  precode ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/ /code/pre  Right click on the  Webpage Previews Folder and select- Get Info  In Get info window select Locked.  From now on Safari will not save Top pages in that folder any more.  <comment185482> As per your comment, I changed the Delete to Disable. If you think this is a error let me know. <comment185551> Thanks. I have done that but Top Sites still does its thing. <comment185565> Did you restart Safari after locking the folder?
