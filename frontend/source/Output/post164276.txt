Yosemite - Change default C and fortran compilers <body> I am struggling to build a climate model that depends heavily on C and Fortran compilers installed on the machine.  I installed XCode and its default compilers, but I had to install more recent versions from MacPorts since I need updated compilers.  Therefore, I currently have two distinct versions of the compilers installed on my Mac (using here gcc as an example, but it is the same with gfortran):  gcc, from XCode, installed on /usr/local/bin/gfortran  gcc-mp-4.9, from MacPorts, installed on /opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-4.9  What I need to do is to set stronggcc-mp-4.9/strong as the default gcc compiler of the system, for any purpose at all. I created an alias on my bash.profile:  precodealias gcc='gcc-mp-4.9' /code/pre  which works if I just type gcc on terminal. However, if I type "which gcc", the system still detects the old version:  precode$ which gcc  /usr/bin/gcc /code/pre  which causes me some troubles, because most of the libraries I have to build rely on the output of 'which' to determine the compiler to be used.  Without removing /usr/bin/gcc or creating symblic links, is there any way to indicate to the system that gcc-mp-4.9 is the default gcc compiler for any occasion?  Thanks in advance, Thiago.  <answer164302> After some deeper research, I came up with the solution. I solved this problem by using MacPorts:  precodesudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc49 /code/pre  So, problem solved!  <comment192739> It may not be useful with this issue, but I've also used soft links to force particular versions of software to be used. e.g. `/usr/local/bin/gcc` is a soft link to the desired gcc version.
