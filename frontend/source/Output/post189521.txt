Why am I not getting notified by email when my Find My iPhone is used? <body> I am not getting notified when the Find My iPhone app is used or even if I try searching via iCloud. How can I enable them?  <answer189539> You only get notified if you:  ol liPlay a sound on the remote device/li liPut the remote device on Lost mode/li liAsk to be notified when it comes back online if the device is offline/li /ol  Just watching the location of the device on the app or iCloud does not trigger a notification.  There may be ways of finding out, they are discussed in this question:      However, your son could enable Status Bar Icon so that the device shows the location services icon in the status bar when the location tracking is active.      Settings → Privacy → Location Services → Find my iPhone → Status Bar Icon   This shows the normal location services icon (and not a special icon for Find my iPhone) if the device's location is being obtained through Find my iPhone.
