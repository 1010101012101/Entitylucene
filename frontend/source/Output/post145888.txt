How can I open new Chrome window with different arguments? <body> I want to have a new Chrome window with same origin policy (CORS) disabled for development, while keeping the existing one open for browsing. I already have tried the CORS plugin but it does not work for local files.  Apparently, this can be done on Windows. Can it be done on OSX (10.8) ?  <answer145891> precodenohup /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-web-security 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; /code/pre  nohup lets you quit Terminal without killing the process.br Arguments are added as normal before the code2&gt;…/code redirection.  Alternatively, you can try:  precodeopen /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --disable-web-security /code/pre  <comment171940> Opened a new window but CORS was still enabled (argument was not in effect)... <comment172048> @user Edited answer—try that? <comment172280> No luck, just makes the last viewed chrome window focused...
