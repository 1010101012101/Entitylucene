How can I get the iPhone to automatically switch between 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz WiFi? <body> I have an Asus RT-AC86U router. I gave the router a standard configuration with a 2.4Ghz band called "MySSID" and a 5Ghz band called "MySSID_5G." Same key (i.e., password) on both.  Two people in the house have Android phones, which connect to the 5Ghz band in certain areas of the house (close to the router) and the 2.4Ghz band (far from the router), presumably based on signal strength. Two people in the house have iPhones (one a 5S and the other a 5C), which connect to the 5Ghz band fine, but do not switch to 2.4Ghz automatically. Instead the WiFi connection gets dropped and it falls back to 4G LTE, usually with an interruption in network connectivity.  It seems some people have had similar issues with range extenders but I haven't seen exactly the same issue reported elsewhere. What settings can I change on these iPhones or on my router to improve this?  <comment278942> How about telling the iPhones to `Forget this network` on the 5GHz band?
