Torrent clients for Mac other than uTorrent <body> Can someone recommend a good torrent client for the Mac, other than uTorrent?  [The only problem I have with uTorrent is that occasionally it doesn't respect the upload limit. This is a known issue, and no setting seems to fix it in my case.]  I am looking for these features:  ol liAbility to select files to download (in case of multi-file torrent) BEFORE the download begins /li liShow transfer rates in the dock icon/li liAssign relative priorities to files within a torrent/li liGood, clean UI (optional)/li liNo bloatware/adware like a built in media player, ads, yahoo-search-plugins, etc (optional)/li /ol  <answer144396> I highly recommend the open source client Transmission.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bIypD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Features:     ul   liThe Mac OS X interface is written in Objective-C/li   liShows transfer rates in the dock icon/li   liUses Growl notifications and dock badging to keep you informed./li   liDownload/Upload Prioritization/li   /ul   hr  Other:     ul   liDoesn't bundle toolbars, pop-up/flash ads, social tools, or any other useless crap./li   liIt doesn't hold some feaures back for a payware version./li   liIts source code is available for anyone to review./li   liDoesn't track users, and their website/forums have no third-party ads or analytics./li   /ul   I've been using Transmission for many years and can't imagine using anything else.  <answer150653> Transmission is my favorite torrent client, both on Linux and Mac.  <answer162581> Try Tribler, designed to fight censorship by using built-in anonymity:  Tribler.org  There is an article about it here:  Anonymous and impossible to shut down  It's open source too.  <answer169889> Try qbittorrent.org   It does all the things you asked for, except showing the transfer rates in the Dock icon. But I didn't check for this option very thorough, it might have it :-)  One of the best features for me is that it can download a file in sequential order (think of a video that you can start watching it, before the download finishes 100%).   <answer222928> One more venerable classic client is Deluge.  Completely free from advertising and unwanted plugins, and has a focus on providing features the community needs, such as private downloads, password protection, and scheduling and bandwidth options.  Supports a range of plugins that expand its functionality. The plugins can utilise privacy blocklists (which you shouldn't rely on), labelling, scheduling and notification options. You can monitor folders for files, and add them automatically.  <comment170082> Thanks for your suggestion. Does it have all/most of the features listed in the question above? <comment170083> Yes, it has all of them. <comment199596> How does that improve or add to previous answers <comment268974> I believe SE sites do not permit requests for software recommendations.  Is that not the case for the Apple SE site?  (NOT that I'm complaining.  That rule is kind of lame, and this is a useful question.) <comment287180> This is great. Unlike ÂµTorrent, it actually *works* on my machine, unlike Vuze, it has no bundled adware, and unlike Transmission (my otherwise favourite), it supports connecting via a proxy. It's nice and lightweight, too. <comment303203> I was looking for something like this, not famous but good and os.
