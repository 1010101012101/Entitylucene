Terminal "LoadModule" - command not found <body> I installed via homebrew the new php56 version.  To activate it and use it I typed this in the Terminal:  precodeLoadModule php5_module    /usr/local/opt/php56/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so /code/pre  But it says: code-bash: LoadModule: command not found/code  What can I do?  <answer144251> LoadModule is for your Apache configuration file httpd.conf, not for being run in your shell.  <comment169950> thanks. But when I add this line to the file and run `php -v` it still says PHP 5.4 (but I installed 5.6) <comment169954> @Akeno That's a completely separate issueâ€”setting the version of PHP for your shell is different to setting it for Apache. Feel free to ask a separate question, preferably with a link to the tutorial you are following if appropriate.
