Is there a way to make caps lock behave like it does on other PCs? <body> Normally on a PC, if you have caps lock enabled, holding shift will result in lower case characters appearing.  precodeWithout Caps Lock  wITH cAPS lOCK /code/pre  On OSX, this behavior doesn't occur - that is, holding shift while caps lock is engaged doesn't produce lower case. The behavior is specific to OSX, since it doesn't happen in a Boot Camp installed copy of Windows.  Is there a way to change this behavior to be more traditional?
