allow sudo only at a specific time of day <body> Is it possible to configure codesudo/code so that it only works at a specific time of day, say, from 9AM to 10AM?  In Linux, this can be done by editing code/etc/security/time.conf/code, but I don't know if this is doable in OS X.  <comment97853> `/etc/security/time.conf` in Linux uses PAM module `pam_time.so`, which is not included in OS X PAM implementation (do `ls -l /usr/lib/pam/` to see the list of PAM modules available in OS X). So PAM won't work out of the box (you may want to try to compile and extend PAM, though).
