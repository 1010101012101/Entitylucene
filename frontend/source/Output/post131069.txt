How can I remove a non-MAS app from Launchpad without uninstalling? <body> I have a non App Store app installed so the 'X' does not appear when I hold down the icon.  I don't want to uninstall the app, just remove it only from Launchpad.  It's OS X Mavericks  <answer131070> strongLaunchpad Manager/strong will allow you to delete any app from your Launchpad. Just open it, select the app you want to delete and press ⌘⌫.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jkJU.png" alt="Launchpad Manager Image"
