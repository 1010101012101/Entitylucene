Nested IF statement in Numbers <body> I am working on a table to tabulate mileage costs for my small business.  I have 3 destinations I go to on a regular basis.  I would like the address to automatically populate in the C cell if the expression is met in the B cell.  I have copied numerous equations from various websites, but have not been able to get any of the equations to work.  The latest is pasted below.  precodeIF((B88="SHADY GROVE METRO","15903 SOMMERVILLE DR",IF((B88="POR TRAIN STATION","CLAY STREET",IF(B88="BWI","7062 ELM ROAD","")))))) /code/pre  Am I even close?  <answer219438> It looks like you have a lot of extra parenthesis everywhere...    give this a try.  precodeIF(B88="SHADY GROVE METRO","15903 SOMMERVILLE DR",IF(B88="POR TRAIN STATION","CLAY STREET",IF(B88="BWI","7062 ELM ROAD",""))) /code/pre  To provide a bit more detail, for every left paren (, you need a matching right paren ) to close the expression.    Counting what you've shown, you have 5 left parens, and 6 right parens.   This would likely cause an error due to the mismatch.     Additionally, each expression only needs one left paren to start it, not two.  <answer219439> You are close. If I understand your expression correctly (B88=Client and C=Street) the correct expression is:  precode=IF(B88="SHADY GROVE METRO";"15903 SOMMERVILLE DR";IF(B88="POR TRAIN STATION";"CLAY STREET";IF(B88="BWI";"7062 ELM ROAD";"not defined"))) /code/pre  Example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zatZR.png" alt="Numbers example"  I've added a "not defined" instead of an (empty) "" for emif-false/em.  <comment265512> Thank you so much!
