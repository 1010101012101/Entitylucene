What are the development tools on the Mac? <body> Are there any development tools like NetBeans or Eclipse on OS X that I can use to write an application?  <answer556> Xcode was good for your job. If you want use NetBeans and Eclipse on your Mac, you can download them, too, because they have OS X distributions.  ul liEclipse/li liNetbeans/li /ul  <answer558> If you are looking for Java development on the Mac, both NetBeans and Eclipse have a distribution for Mac OS X. Xcode also has support for Java, but it is not a Java-centric tool.  <answer46009> There are built-in vim and emacs. Both of them can be used strongas IDE/strong.  Built-in vim and emacs don't have GUI (only console versions) but at least they are relatively new in latest OSX versions.  If you want GUI versions there are strongMacVim/strong and a couple of GUI bemacs/bies/i for OSX.  <comment524> It is Xcode, not XCode, xCode, or X Code (my friends on the Xcode team point that out constantly ;-) <comment537> I don't have enough reputation. Can someone fix the spelling in the title? <comment544> You mention Netbeans and Eclipse - are you specifically looking for Java-related tools, or development in general? There are dozens of development tools/platforms you can use on the Mac (many of which I'm happy to mention if you are casting your net wider than Java). <comment547> I edited I write it like other apple apps. <comment558> You should also correct the overall syntax and orthography.
