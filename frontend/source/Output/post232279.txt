Download Apple developer documentation as PDF files <body> There used to be an option in Apple's developer documents, to download guides as PDF files. Not sure if this is guide specific.  For example, this one Introduction to System Configuration Programming Guidelines has no download option.  How can I download it?  <answer232281> It's probably not the option you was looking for but you can "print the page to PDF". So just start your print-task as you would usually do and then click "Save to PDF" when selecting a printer.  If you're on Windows, you could use CutePDF-writer to perform this task for you.   I've tested this for you, the printing option is very friendly for your page and margins.  <answer232284> Whatever be the reason, Apple has stopped providing PDF copies of most of it's Developer Documentation.  This won't work for all pages, but for your specific document, a PDF copy definitely used to exist (shown by this answer on SO).  The PDF itself is no longer available from Apple servers, but a quick Google search brought up this archived copy on CiteSeerX.  Whether you trust it is not modified or edited in any way is up to you (VirusTotal seems to say it's safe).  <comment283767> Are you certain it is *that* page? It's updated 10 years ago.. <comment283770> don't know if this page had download option. otherwise, yes that's page I need. <comment283779> My eyes are thankful.
