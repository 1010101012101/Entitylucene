Lost focus of the application selected through Mission Control <body> This problem has been around for at least a year on multiple Sierra versions.  When I’m switching to another app through Mission Control it focuses on that app only for a split of a second and then switches focus to another app. Here’s the video showing the issue (it switches back to Evernote.app despite clicking on the Finder.app):  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ustogynwyeu12w4/scr_focus_lost.mov?dl=0  It seems that the app that is set to be visible on All Desktops loses focus if you are switching from an app that has been set to emsome/em Desktop (Desktop on Display 1, 2, etc.).  What is the solution to this problem?  <comment354426> Just clarifying, are you saying you've had this problem since macOS Sierra, or also beforehand? I ask because you say _This problem has been around for at least a year on multiple Sierra versions_, but macOS Sierra has only been around for about 7 months. This is an important distinction because troubleshooting is a process of elimination and if it's been around only since Sierra, than that eliminates some of the possibilities. <comment354428> I am 100% positive for Sierra, but I'm not sure about El Capitan. However, when I look at the timeline it's quite possible it was present on El Capitan as well. Unfortunately, I cannot determine that anymore.
