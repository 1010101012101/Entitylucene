Flickering horizontal pixels <body> Recently my MacBook Pro Retina started to have a weird monitor issue: horizontal "stripes" of pixels sometimes appear/flicker (I recorded the issue here).  Anyone experienced anything similar? And should I be worried and send it for repair/diagnostics? I am not yet 100% sure how to reproduce the issue so I am afraid that the technicians won't be able to reproduce it.

(ï£¿  About my Mac) <comment356628> @bret7600 edited op. Also the laptop is still under warranty <comment356635> You can see if the system is aware of the issue. If it is, then Apple will replace the part with no questions asked (hopefully). You can run the same diagnostics that Apple would by running [Apple Diagnostics](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202731).  To do this, press and hold D on boot. From here, select a wifi network (or use Ethernet) and allow the diagnostics to show output. For more info, see the link -- please add the output from the test. <comment356664> @bret7600 got code `ADP000`. I got an additional piece of possibly relevant information - when I was recording my desktop using QuickTime player and the issue happened, it was not visible on the recorded footage. <comment356672> ADP000 means no problems found... if you can find out what the alert from QuickTime said, we might be able to resolve the issue. -- All the best! <comment356711> thanks for your help @bret7600! I probably did not express myself clearly about the QuickTime. What I meant is, that the flickering was not visible on the QuickTime recorded footage (and the recording went without a problem) so imo it is a hardware issue. <comment356751> Your welcome... too bad we weren't able to solve it -- maybe go see apple about a display warranty replacement.
