Mission Control Animation <body> I've install Lion on both MBP17 2008 and iMac27 i7 2010. On the old MBP, Mission Control animation are smooth but on the iMac, the desktop slide away with a nice animation but then all the application window appear in a snap with no animation at all.  Is there a way to turn this feature on again ?  <comment20663> This isn't a feature, it's a bug. Have you tried restarting? <comment20871> @Nathan : yes I did.  Does not change anything <comment23217> possible duplicate of [How can I disable animation when switching desktops in Lion?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17929/how-can-i-disable-animation-when-switching-desktops-in-lion) same slowness - same desire to disable the new animation <comment29814> Is the OP trying to disable the animation, or make it work again? <comment29817> They're trying to make it work again.
