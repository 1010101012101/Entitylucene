Is there a way to make `open -a` pass command line arguments to the app it launches? <body> I'd like to run OpenSCAD from the command line with some arguments.  precode$ open -a openscad myfile.scad /code/pre  works as I expect.  precode$ open -a openscad --args --help /code/pre  reports  precodeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/OpenSCAD.app with error -10810. /code/pre  when OpenSCAD is not already running.  When OpenSCAD is already running, then codeopen -a openscad --args --help/code simply brings OpenSCAD to the foreground.  What I really need is for this to work:  precode$ open -a openscad --args -o myfile.stl myfile.scad /code/pre  which works just like my previous example.  What should I do to launch OpenSCAD with command line arguments?  Before hitting submit I reproduced my questions for pasting here, and I found a solution that more-or-less works.  All of these seem to do what I expect, even if OpenSCAD is not already running.  precode$ /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD --help $ /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD --args --help $ /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD -o ball.stl ball.scad $ /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD --args -o ball.stl ball.scad /code/pre  Still, is there a way to make codeopen -a/code pass command line arguments to the app it launches?  <answer175888> The only thing I can get to work is opening a file. It seems that the App is not made to accept the args this way.  codeopen -a openscad --args '/path/to/foo.scad'/code  The App does have an Applescript scripting definition but it only has codereload/code defined.  <comment207530> I don't have openscad. But have you tried to open -a openscad --args '--help' or open -a openscad --args "--help" <comment207545> I didn't see change in behaviour by adding quotes.
