Synergy refusing connections <body> I came back to work this morning to find that Synergy is no longer working between my Mac server and a Windows client. The client is trying to connect, and the Mac is refusing the connection. Actual message:   precodeNOTE: connecting to '192.168.0.114': 192.168.0.114:24800 WARNING: failed to connect to server: Connection was refused. /code/pre  I confirmed or tried the following:  ul liConfirmed that Synergy is running on the Mac as a server./li liThe server has the PC specified as a client./li liThe name of the PC in the server configuration matches the name of the name of the PC./li liOn the client, tried both autoconfiguration and explicitly entered the IP address of the server. /li liChecked the Firewall settings on the server. The firewall is turned off./li liChecked the Privacy settings on the server. Synergy is allowed to control the computer./li /ul  I'm posting this here because I'm certain this is an issue on the Mac server's end. This worked fine on Friday. At some point there was a power failure and I had to restart the PC. I vaguely remember that there was some sort of privacy/firewall configuration that has to be changed, but I can't seem to find it in Internet search.  <comment373706> Did you check whether the client got a new IP address from the DHCP after the restart, and whether the server knows about this? <comment373736> Not sure why that matters, since the server configuration doesn't appear to depend on the IP address of the client.
