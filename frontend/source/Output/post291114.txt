Will iOS app be rejected if we show app-specific subscription expiry/renewal message? <body> We do not use In App Purchases in our app, but we also do not have a sign-up or external link to our portal sign-up page in our app. Will Apple reject our app if we at least show a subscription expiry/renewal message closer to the actual subscription expiry of the customer's account with us?  <comment367528> Does the subscription unlock features in your app? <comment367669> Yes renewing from our portal does unlock but it is not an in-app subscription, it is just a message to the user indicating that his subscription is about to expire. We do not even plan to show the portal URL for renewal in the message.
