How to bypass country restrictions on App Store? <body> I want to download an iPhone app which is not accessible from my country (India). How can I bypass the country restrictions?  <answer111561> You need an iTunes account for the country-specific store in order to download apps restricted to certain countries. If the app is not free, you also will need either a credit card issued in that country or some iTunes gift cards (also from that country).  <comment131649> For git cards etc see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29282/can-i-download-apps-from-the-us-app-store-if-im-using-a-different-store/29296#29296
