Deleted account still being detected (OS X El Capitan) <body> I recently got a Macbook and easily set up my user account (admin), plus a standard and guest account.   One day, I opened the computer and the screen was frozen. After waiting a few mins, I forcefully shut it down by holding the power button. When I turned it on, my account was gone, only the standard and guest accounts were left.  I logged in to the standard account. I could see my admin account on the User list. However, no matter what I tried, I could not access it, it just wouldn't show up on the login screen. I ended up changing the standard account to an admin account and deleting my original admin account completely.   A few days later, I tried to create a new admin account with my name. However, when I put my name in, it said that this name was being used by another user, even though I had completely deleted it before.   Any idea how to solve this?   <answer224728> Try this command  precodedscl . list /Users | grep -v '^_' /code/pre  to show all users. Then see if there are users with your desired username already. If there are, you can delete them. Go to System Preference - Users&amp;Groups and delete all that you do not need.
