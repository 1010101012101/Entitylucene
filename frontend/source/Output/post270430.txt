Can I make IPsec VPN server with Server app for Mac? <body> In Server app there is no option to choose type of VPN I want to make, only option is L2TP.   And I would probably be ok with that, but I want to make app that connects to my VPN, and in objective-c only two protocols are available and its NEVPNProtocolIPSec and NEVPNProtocolIKEv2, I tried to connect on L2TP with IPsec but its not possible, so I'm looking for a way to make another VPN on my Mac.  So my question is can I make IPsec or IKEv2 VPN server with Server app on Mac?
