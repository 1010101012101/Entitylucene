Mac won't boot, rather it shows a lighted black screen when powered on <body> My MacBook Retina Mid 2013 won't come on. When I press the power button it'll just show a black screen.  I've tried to put it in recovery mode by holding down the kbdCommand/kbd + kbdR/kbd keys.  I even tried kbdCommand/kbd kbdOption/kbd kbdR/kbd.  I also tried to reset the NVRAM (holding kbdCommand/kbd kbdOption/kbd kbdP/kbd kbdR/kbd yet nothing.  Please I need aid on how to fix it.  <comment316890> Have you got another Mac? I had a similar problem after an update but found that I could Screen Share into it and restart it from there. Failing another Mac, another machine with VNC. <comment316903> Do you get the startup chime?  Also, try resetting your [SMC](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295).  Basically, Shift-Control-Option and Power Button while plugged in.  Do you have the ability to hook up an external monitor?
