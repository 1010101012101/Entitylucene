Itunes 12.3.2.35 playlist order non-alphabetic <body> After updating iTunes to 12.3 something strange happened:  ul liWhen adding a new title or folder to my playlists it is added in the playlist view at the left as last item !/li liWhen adding a title to the playlists and selecting a place, iTunes shows me as drop down an "alphabetic" list , why is this?/li /ul  How can I synchronize the two views to alphabetic?  <answer223395> Restart iTunes.  I have the same problem. After I create a playlist, the order of the playlists (in the sidebar) is sometimes not alphabetical. I suspect it's a bug. Restarting iTunes has always fixed it for me so far, though.  <comment271023> Thanks for your info ! I rebooted the Mac yesterday and afterwards found the items in iTunes in the right order ! It seems to be a bug ! <comment302648> I confirm it is a bug. The problem is still there on version 12.3.3.17. <comment302649> The problem is still present in version 12.3.3.17. Moral of software quality and updates: limit updates to when you have a real needed improvment provided by the version the seller wants you to test.
