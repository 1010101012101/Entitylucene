Can anyone make an iOS todo app recommendation <body> I am looking for a todo app that does the following:  ul lireoccurring daily tasks/li lireminders via push notifications, if they aren't completed/li lisync lists between multiple devices, and preferably multiple users/li lisome sort of log that shows when and who completed a task/li /ul  Thanks!  <answer131810> Wunderlist meets all your requirements.  <comment154892> I was looking at that application earlier today, it seemed like there was a subscription required for sharing lists. Is that correct? I don't mind buying an app, but I don't really want to subscribe to a service. <comment154894> You can share lists for free, you just can't attach files or use the conversation feature. <comment155221> Thanks been using this over the weekend and it is working pretty well.
