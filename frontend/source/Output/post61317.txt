TextMate 2: How to permanently default to soft tabs (spaces instead of tabs)? <body> h3SETUP/h3  OS X 10.8br TextMate 2 -r9283br  h3QUESTION/h3  How can I strongpermanently/strong force TextMate to to strongalways/strong default to strongsoft tabs/strong (use spaces, not tabs)?  I want to know how to make TextMate strongdefault/strong to this setting so that I don't have to constantly convert tabs to spaces while working on a file.   How do you strongpermanently/strong tell TextMate 2 to prefer soft tabs?  <answer61318> Put the following in code~/.tm_properties/code:   precodesoftWrap = true tabSize = 4 softTabs = true /code/pre  <answer61319> TextMate 2 uses a special file called code.tm_properties/code to control lots of settings in the app. It will use code~/.tm_properties/code if present for global defaults. You can also add one inside a source tree to control settings for a particular project.  The setting you're looking for is:  precodesoftTabs = true /code/pre  Just add that line to code~/.tm_properties/code (or create it if it doesn't exist).  You can read more about this file here.  <comment337923> `softWrap` is unrelated to this question.
