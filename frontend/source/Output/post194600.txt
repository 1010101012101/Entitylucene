how to conditionally ignore cell when applying sumproduct using Numbers (Mac) <body> Under Excel, there's something like = Sumproduct((A1:A100),--(A1:A100&lt;"")) from Excel formula - how to change SUMPRODUCT formula to skip null cells  But it did not work for Numbers. Wondering if there's a good way to achieve it using Numbers  E.g. I would like to do the sumproduct of following two columns, but only if the value of the second column is greater than 1  1   1  2   2  3   3  4   4  5   5  <comment232164> isn't the sum of zeros , zero ! <comment232173> I did not get your point, what did you mean. <comment232174> turned out sumproduct will automatically exclude empty cell, then what if we would like to conditionally exclude cells for sumproduct? <comment247325> did you end up founding a solution for this @cheneychen? I'm looking for the exact same solution: http://superuser.com/questions/971060/google-sheets-excel-sumproduct-but-ignore-empty-cells
