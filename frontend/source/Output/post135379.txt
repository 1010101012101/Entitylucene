Finder does not show files in folders <body> When I open Finder all folders seem to be empty. Checking with the console shows that all files are there. This is also true if I try to open a file from within an application using the codeFile/code menu.  If I paste the full path of the file into the text field of the file dialog, the file gets opened.  If I jump to a subfolder with Cmd-Shift-G that works fine. But again the folder is empty.  Any ideas what's missing?  <answer135381> After all this turned out to be a side effect from codecom.apple.IconServicesAgent/code going wild and eating up lots of CPU.  Running codemkdir ${TMPDIR}/com.apple.IconServices/code in Terminal solved the problem immediately.  <answer196081> It my case, it was Finder itself that was going wild and eating up lots of CPU. I have no idea why. But killing and restarting the process fixed the issue of empty folders displaying.   In general, I suppose it's a good idea to go into Activity Monitor, see what's eating up CPU and restart anything that's using an unreasonably high level.  <comment160459> in all Finders view options ? <comment160460> log in as different user to check. <comment160461> Silly question - is iTunes up to date?  There was a bug on the ~/users folder that cause people to not have access to their own files recently caused by iTunes (now fixed). <comment185946> superb fix. i would have had no idea IconServicesAgent was the culprit <comment248772> wow. thanks. this thing was killing my cpu and battery overheating. but all i did was simply kill it from Activity Monitor (in Applications / Utilities folder)  and restarted Finder. <comment285323> Excellent solution!
