Both Quicktime Player and VLC keep stopping the video (but not the audio) since 10.6.8. Any ideas? <body> Since I updated to 10.6.8 yesterday (and this might be coincidence), both Quicktime Player (I still use 7) and VLC (current version) keep stopping the video (but not the audio) of movies I am watching. This happens whether they are in the background or fullscreen and fixes itself when the program gains focus.  Is this a faulty video driver that came with 10.6.8 or what could be the reason?  Mac Pro 2009 2x2.26 GHz, 24 GB, ATI Radeon HD 4870.  <comment22602> This is still ongoing. And I remember that it happened before but went away again. <comment51872> Yes, even for me on a fairly fast MacBook Pro 2.3GHz i5 (10.6.8) Rendering some edits in After Effects, they play perfectly fine, but once I export them, the players stutter and pause for an uncomfortable amount of time before eventually resuming. <comment51939> Everything started working again a few months ago. Still don't know what it was.
