securityd goes nuts every 4 minutes & 30 seconds <body> securityd spams my console with the following :   precode19/04/2012 16:23:17.405 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001 /code/pre  repeated 563 times (after disabling the default mps_limit of 500).  4 minutes and 30 seconds later (give or take a couple of seconds), it does it all over again.  Oddly, the message is split over that boundary :   precode04/05/2012 09:32:16.092 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001 04/05/2012 09:32:16.092 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001 04/05/2012 09:32:16.092 com.apple.securityd: Value  04/05/2012 09:36:19.470 com.apple.securityd: of bTransmit: 00000001 04/05/2012 09:36:19.470 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001 04/05/2012 09:36:19.470 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001 /code/pre  It's pretty annoying.  Anyone know what causes it, or what bTransmit might be?  There seems to be no mention of it on Google.  <answer50372> You are facing a continuous flow of information messages. This flow is truncated by chunck of 500, which is the default value of codemps_limit/code in code/etc/asl.conf/code. This means that your flow of security related messages is at a rate strong 500 / s/strong. This is huge.  Could you open:  precode/var/log/secure.log /var/log/kernel.log /code/pre  and check which message could be related with this continuous flow of information messages?  Could you type the following command (in an codexterm/code or codeTerminal/code window):  precodetop -o msgsent /code/pre  to check if the culprit could be a local process and tracked down through its huge level of messages sent? You will have to enlarge your window to more than 152 characters large to see the film.  <answer50504> Are you using a smartcard reader or some other kind of security related hardware?  Seems like this is an error in a kernel extension or driver for some piece of security hardware.   <comment57847> There's nothing related in secure.log or kernel.log, unfortunately ("IOSurface: buffer allocation size is zero" every few minutes, but I'm assuming that's nothing to do with it).  Nothing jumps out at me in 'top', but the msgsent values are all pretty high so it's difficult to see the wood for the trees...  I've updated the initial post with a couple more details <comment57933> hmm.  I do have a USB VPN key, but I don't recall it having any custom drivers.  I do have some tuntap software installed... I'll take a look when I'm back at work next week and see if either of those might be the culprits. <comment57935> Prompted by your comment I ended up grepping my entire harddrive for 'bTransmit'.  Turns out, it's from the SafeNet SDK, which is used for my eToken doohickey.  So... yeah.  I'll go complain to them and see what they have to say about it.
