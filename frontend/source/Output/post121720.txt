What is the best way to migrate a .bash_profile to Mavericks <body> I have a pretty extensive .bash_profile set up on my older machine using Lion and I would like to include a lot of the same functionality. I noticed that Mavericks doesn't have a .bash_profile by default.  What is the best practice here?  precode.bashrc .bash_profile .profile /code/pre  Should I just create the file, should it be picked up automatically or is there anything else to configure?  Note: This is just for a single user account, so it doesn't have to be set up globally.  <answer121722> Go right ahead and put your old code.bash_profile/code file in your home directory and it will get read.  For your purposes code.bash_profile/code, code.bash_login/code and code.profile/code are identical with the exception that one and only one will be read - the first one found of the three with bash searching in that order.  code.bashrc/code is only read when you run an interactive shell that is not a login shell.  <comment141940> Terminal.app by default runs a login shell <comment141953> Some more info; on a typical system, `.profile` contains common settings that will be needed regardless of what type of login it is. `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc` then both include it and also set their own settings for either a login or interactive shell.
