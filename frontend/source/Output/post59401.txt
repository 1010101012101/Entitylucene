Restoring 'User Guides And Information' folder on a Mac preinstalled with Lion or higher <body> When you buy a new Mac you get a digital copy of all important information relating to your hardware. These are located in the 'User Guides And Information' folder on your hard drive, or more specifically code\Library\Documentation\User Guides And Information\/code. If you need to reinstall OS X nowadays, these files aren't placed back. I assume you could restore these files for pre-Lion Macs, since these Macs came with full restore discs. But Internet Recovery sadly doesn't restore these files.  My question is: Can I restore this folder somehow? I'm not asking where I can download the individual files, but I would like to restore this folder like how it was when you bought your Mac.  <comment68432> You are aware that these documents are rather outdated and contain a lot of information which isn't applicable any longer? <comment68434> @patrix This Mac is pretty new, so can I assume that these documents that came with it are relevant? :-/ I like the feeling of a 'complete' Mac. <comment68438> Get them from http://support.apple.com/manuals/ then. At least on the three Macs I have here the only "interesting" document is the User Guide, the rest are hardware certifications and similar legalize.
