Bring all windows of active application to top <body> When switching to an application (cmd+tab or clicking on an app icon), osx brings all of the application's windows to top.  I would like to trigger this behaviour for the emactive/em application with some shortcut, or most preferably triggered when clicking the dock icon of the active application. (Currently clicking on the dock icon of an active app switches to the next workspace that has a window of the app.)  strongIs there a way to bring to top all windows of the active application?/strong  EDIT: Seems there's a emWindow - Bring All to Front/em action that does this. Now I only need a way to trigger this action, preferably when the app icon in the dock is clicked.  Third party command solutions (e.g. some simple keyboard shortcut app to run the Bring All to Front action) are welcome, though I'd prefer a native way of doing this.  <answer101604> You can assign a keyboard shortcut to the "Bring All to Front" menu item from System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHFMI.png" alt=""  The codeactivate/code AppleScript command also raises all windows:  precodeactivate application (path to frontmost application as text) /code/pre  If you are assigning keyboard shortcuts to opening applications, you can use scripts like this:  precodetell application "TextEdit"     reopen     activate end tell /code/pre  codereopen/code opens a new default window if there are no open "default" windows, like a text editor window in TextEdit. If all default windows are minimized, codereopen/code unminimizes one of them.  It is also possible to use AppleScript to click the "Bring All to Front" menu item:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)     click menu item "Bring All to Front" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Window" of menu bar 1 end tell /code/pre  <comment119666> what about right click on the application and selecting show all windows? <comment119667> @Buscarì›ƒ "Show all windows" does not bring them to top, but activates the expose view for all the windows of that application. <comment119671> Not sure what you want then. Is it to open all minimized or hidden windows at once (with one command or click) in full size view ? <comment119672> I want the effect that happens when you switch to an different application: All of the application's (non-minimized, same-workspace) windows are brought to top. The same that is in Window - Bring All to Front. <comment119674> I don't think that feature exists, but if you feel like trying the Automator or Terminal script  (or 3d party app like Witch) and maybe specifying that in your question would help clarifying. <comment119680> Third party solutions are ok. I added mention of that to the question. <comment119685> You could use Keyboard Maestro to create a macro and bind it to a set of keystrokes.
