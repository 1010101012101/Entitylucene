Has anyone managed to put a GeForce 980m inside iMacs with MXM slots? <body> Here you can read about people trying to put non-Apple MXM GPUs inside iMacs:  http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2011-imac-graphics-card-upgrade.1596614/  Of course, there are issues due to EFI incompatibilities (I hope someone will resolve them in the future), but e.g. a GeForce 780m seems to be working in some cases. I wonder whether anyone tried to use a powerful GeForce 980m for this.     <answer254022> I tried a 970m and I have not gotten it working yet.  It does boot into Windows (Bootcamp) and after some config file editing I managed to install the nvidia drivers but during the installation the display went black. When I boot the driver crashes and Windows uses it Standard Driver.  I am still trying to get it to work. I will update this if I make any progress.  Edit: Driver problem might be connected to Windows 10 and the source laptop of my 970m. I will try now if Windows 8.1 makes a difference.
