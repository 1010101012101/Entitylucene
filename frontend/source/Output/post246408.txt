MacBook Pro Retina 2013 memory frequency limit <body> I would like to replace the 2x8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 of soldered memory in my 15" 2013 MacBook Pro with some faster RAM. Is this MacBook Pro compatible?  hr  This is not a duplicate question (Allan, patrix marked) because it about different device. Question about RAM frequency for specific device, not in general...  <answer246414> I am 99% sure that the 2013 MBP will not be compatible with faster RAM than 1600MHz, Apple spec sheets state this, with a memory type of DDR3L.  DDR3 is capable of being faster than 1600MHz; DDR4 has different latencies and clockspeeds to DDR3.  I think you're on a hiding to nothing trying to de-solder DDR3 RAM and solder in DDR4. You can try if you like, but I suspect you will just end up with an expensive (but shiny) tray.  <comment303826> I didn't ask "is it possible" i already knew it. I asked about higher than 1600 MHz RAM support. <comment303827> 16Gb is the max as well. So, you want to overclock it? Anyway, it is 1600. Again, according to a 2 minute google search. <comment303838> @lan I want to replace 16GB 1600 MHz with 16GB 1600+ (DDR4 for example). "Anyway, it is 1600." - approve? <comment303844> @Ian The edits made to the question no longer reflect the what is posted in the title. <comment303852> @Allan Yeh sorry, I've tried to update the title, but the peer review failed. <comment303878> The device may be different, but the problem (using faster RAM) is the same. <comment303894> omg, using faster RAM on Calculator is the same problem?... so many edits, duplicates, comments and ZERO useful information.. just delete this question and you will be satisfied!!
