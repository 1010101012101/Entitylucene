Is it possible to use MTP with iPhone without installing iTunes? <body> I want to transfer photos to the windows computer  <answer285238> iTunes is not responsible for photo import [on either Mac or PC].   Windows can use MS Photo Gallery [or equivalent depending on your Win version] as an importer &amp; organiser, the closest free equivalent to Apple's Photos app.  The upside is you don't have to dig around in the file system at all - which is not recommended - the app can handle it all for you.  Re pjctech's answer - idk whether that is also a required first step before my solution will work.  <answer285239> You need to manually install the required driver, the strongApple Mobile Device Support/strong (or AMDS).     ol   liDownload the iTunes installation package from the official Apple Website./li   liYou need a program that can open a CAB file and extract contents from it. 7-zip or WinRar can do it./li   liInspect the content of the iTunes installer iTunes64Setup.exe (that you downloaded in step 1) with 7-zip (right click, 7-zip, Open   archive). 7-zip will show the files inside that installer file./li   liExtract AppleApplicationSupport.msi and AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi from the installer file to harddisk./li   liRun AppleApplicationSupport.msi and then AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi./li   /ol   After AppleMobileDeviceSupport64 is installed, windows should be able to detect the iDevice.
