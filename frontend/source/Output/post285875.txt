Threaded View in iOS Mail.app Truncates Messages <body> In iOS, when viewing messages in Mail, I have a frequent issue in which some earlier part of the thread is shown immediately under the most recently sent message. It isn't the most recent part; it seems to select a part which recently involved me. Thus, there's often an enormous gap in the thread, and I must take special action to view the correct chronology. There are a few ways to view the correct chronology of exchanges:  ol liDisable threaded view: undesirable, as I want access to the associated messages, but as they actually transpired/li liTap "See More" on every message: this expands the message to show the correct chronology. This is what I want to see by default/li liTap the navigational arrows or scroll to the break in the message: undesirable, as it's cumbersome when I just want to see a message/reply or two before the most recent in the thread./li /ol  hr  To clarify this issue, I'll provide an example. Suppose an email exchange between Bob, Alice, Carol, and me (as "Tohuw") went as follows:  emAlice (06:00 5 June 2017)/em     Hi Bob, do you have the draft proposal?   emBob (06:45 5 June 2017)/em     No, sorry. I'm still waiting on Tohuw to provide detailed advice on section 4.   emTohuw (07:10 5 June 2017)/em     Looks like they're asking for more foo in the bar, but providing no corresponding yum. Advise to increment yum accordingly; the rest is fine.   emAlice (07:15 5 June 2017)/em     Understood. Bob, can you please spell this out in the proposal?   emBob (09:00 5 June 2017)/em     Done, draft is available for sign off.   emCarol (08:00 6 June 2017)/em     What's the status of this?   hr  Now, consider the above thread, as it would likely appear in my inbox. The most recent messages from Bob and Alice would be truncated (hidden, actually â€“ I mention above how to view them), so I'm actually forced to undergo extra navigational effort to read the thread correctly. Otherwise I see:  emCarol (08:00 6 June 2017)/em     What's the status of this?   emTohuw (07:10 5 June 2017)/em     Looks like they're asking for more foo in the bar, but providing no corresponding yum. Advise to increment yum accordingly; the rest is fine.   emBob (06:45 5 June 2017)/em     No, sorry. I'm still waiting on Tohuw to provide detailed advice on section 4.   emAlice (06:00 5 June 2017)/em     Hi Bob, do you have the draft proposal?   hr  macOS Mail.app, and indeed no other mail client I have ever used has this unwieldy problem.  It appears there's no option to fix it to my satisfaction, but perhaps I'm missing something.
