How can I upgrade to Yosemite with a broken FireWire module? <body> I've always been able to upgrade OSX versions by removing the FireWire related kexts in single user mode on first boot of the upgraded system, but for Yosemite that approach does not work (the system hangs). Has anyone managed to upgrade to Yosemite with a broken FireWire module on the logic board?  <comment219338> If it's just the ports that are broken, why do you need to do anything with the software? My camera's broken but I've never had to modify a software update to accommodate it somehow. <comment219407> I'm sorry my use of 'ports' was incorrect. The FireWire module on the logic board is dead.
