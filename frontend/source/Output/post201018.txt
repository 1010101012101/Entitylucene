How to disable alert notifications in iOS when battery drops to 20% and then to 10%? <body> Is there a way to disable these alerts that appear when battery drops down to 20% and later on to 10%? em(iPhone 4s iOS 8.4.1)/em.  <answer201026> Unfortunately, there are no ways to disable those alerts unless your device is jailbroken. In that case (device is jailbroken), you can search Cydia for a tweak that disables those alerts.  <comment242406> Thanks! Obviously I won't jailbreak.
