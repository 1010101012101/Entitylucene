Time machine one folder? <body> I want to back only one or some of my folder with time machine. Is it possible somehow to back them? And so I can maybe push down the datastore requirement down below 8GB, and so a flash drive will be enough to be always with me.  <comment201270> As far as I know, the only way to do this is to exclude everything else _except_ that one folder... <comment201288> It sounds like the idea is less about having a backup, and more about how to make an automatically synced USB drive that you can take with you? <comment201317> You might have right, I want a copy about my workspace folder, about the source code of my apps with me always <comment201511> You might want to check the answers to this question at SuperUser:  http://superuser.com/questions/144702/mac-os-x-application-to-sync-a-folder-to-another-disk-in-real-time    You could also google for "folder action" &  "sync"
