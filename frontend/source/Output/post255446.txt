How to Restore Preferred Network List <body> For an unknown reason and after many years of use, the network list (Mac System Preferences  Network  Wi-Fi  Advanced  Wi-Fi) unexpectedly showed only 4 network names. Recently, there were many with WPA passwords. (The reason strongmay/strong have been due to a settings restore on iCloud keychain connected iPhone.)  I searched the keychain and found a similar short list, although there were a few more.  Finding codelogin.keychain/code in Time Machine from a month ago and restoring, returned a large number of those missing networks to the keychain. The only problem now is that the Preferred Network list has not been similarly updated.  I have turned OFF iCloud  keychain on the Mac in hopes of isolating it from iCloud changes for the time being.  code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist/code looks promising, but cannot be restored from Time Machine.  Does anyone know of a way to restore or rebuild that list so it can utilize the keychain passwords?
