how to remove Yosemite installer? <body> I had begin the update and left it overbite for download, it downloaded completely but then failed. I started the download again and this time it had finished successfully but I didn't notice it and thought it had failed again so started the download again. When it downloaded about 3 GB I saw the Yosemite installer and upgraded. But now the second upgrade icon is still there. How do I remove it and its data?  <answer152675> Nevermind, got it.  App Store - Purchases - Press Option and you will see cancel.
