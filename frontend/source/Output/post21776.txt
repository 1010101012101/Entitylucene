X11 application from 'administrator' account <body> Call me paranoid but my everyday account has no privileges.  I have a 'administrator' account who is in wheel. When I want to perform administrative tasks, I open a terminal and do  precodesu - administrator sudo ... /code/pre  This works fine in most situations, except with X11 applications.  precodesudo xeyes /code/pre  fails with     Can't open display:   What I've tried:  ul listart X11 with the everyday user/li lido codexhost +localhost/code with everyday user/li lido codeexport DISPLAY=:0/code with administrator/li /ul  How can I run a X11 application with the administrator account when my desktop runs with the everyday user?  <answer21795> Perhaps codessh -X/code to localhost?  <comment55424> Does `xhost +` work? Or are you too paranoid to try even that?
