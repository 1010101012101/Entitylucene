iPhone drawing too much power from USB ports (yes, I believe it's the device). What can I do? <body> The issue started a couple of days ago. My Macbook Pro kept restarting. After some testing I've realized this happens only when my iPhone is plugged in for charging.  I think it's the device fault because it happened on a friend MacBook too, even with different cables.  I've restarted the iPhone and nothing changed, any suggestion?
