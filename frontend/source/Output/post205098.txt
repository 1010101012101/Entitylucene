How can I check my wifi connection for a long time period (a day) <body> I want to find a way to test my wifi connection between my macbook pro (yosemite) and my router because I have some evidence (lag in games) that the wireless connection has problems. I am using the default router that my isp gave me and a belkin repeater in my room to enhance the signal (although I have the impression that my macbook pro connects to the router and not to the repeater). Is there a terminal utility I can use for this purpose? The wifi logs of my macbook pro are very cryptic so I cannot use them to identify problems (or I don't have the specific knowledge required for reading them). Any ideas? Thank you.
