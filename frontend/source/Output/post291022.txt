Clear iPhone memory caches <body> You used to be able to clear caches and free memory by using the Apple TV app to attempt to rent a large movie. When the phone realized there was not enough memory it would attempt to free up memory, but the purchase would not go through if there still wasn't enough memory to download. This hacky workaround now fails as the TV app has been updated and allows rentals even if there isn't enough space to download.  Is there another workaround/method to free up memory on the iPhone.
