Time after startup is 11 hours ahead of what it should be in OSX Yosemite <body> I have a Macbook Pro 15-inch, Early 2011 running OSX Yosemite 10.10.2. When I start it up, the time is always 11 hours ahead of what it should be. But when I then enter the Date and Time Preferences, the time shifts back to where it needs to be.  For example:  When it's 2pm on the 7th of March 2015, it'll say it's 1am on the 8th of March.  How can I fix this? I tried switching the Automatic Time, but that didn't do anything and I don't want to disable the automatic setting due to DST. Also I tried search 'osx yosemite time is wrong after startup', but that didn't yield anything useful.  <comment207287> What is your setting for Time Zone ? <comment207316> @Buscarì›ƒ The Timezone setting is Australian Eastern Daylight Time (Sydney time), which is expected.
