AppleScript - Get the path to an application without opening it <body> I need to store the path to Chromium to use later in the script, however running codeset chromium to (POSIX path of (path to application "Chromium"))/code in AppleScript Editor opens the application. How can I store the path to the application without causing the application to open. Hard coding the path worked, but I wanted to be able to find the application path instead.  <answer132394> Use Finder to get an application file object:  precodetell application "Finder"     POSIX path of (application file id "org.chromium.Chromium" as alias) end tell /code/pre  You can also get the bundle identifier with codeid of app "Chromium"/code.
