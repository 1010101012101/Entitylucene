How to increase graphics memory in Mac OS running as a client in VMware? <body> I have installed Mac OS in VMware today and its default settings are as follow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtVEy.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can i configure the virtual workstation to increase the graphics memory to 512MB from the present value of 128MB?  <answer79454> VMware's knowledge base article, Setting Custom Video Memory Size in Fusion, shows the setting to change:     h2Setting Custom Video Memory Size in Fusion/h2      There is no way to choose a different video memory size through the   user interface. It must be done by editing the virtual machine   settings (code.vmx/code) file. For more information, see Editing the .vmx file   for your Fusion virtual machine (1014782).      Add this line to the .vmx file:      codesvga.vramSize = value_in_bytes/code      where value_in_bytes is the desired memory size in bytes   The code.vmx/code mentioned in the article is hidden within your virtual machine's bundle. To find the file to edit, right-click (or Control-click) on your virtual machine in the Finder and   select strongShow Package Contents/strong.  <answer87382> If you have installed OS X on VMWare workstation for Windows, you need VMsvga2.  Install that .pkg file inside OS X and you'll see a noticeable change in the animations.  You'll also find updated versions of VMsvga2 for Mavericks inside Files section. You are required to install all required patches &amp; updates for everything to work.  <answer113452> Be sure to take a snapshot before you install SVGA2.  On my MacVM the SVGA2 driver kills a couple programs like iPhoto and Safari.  Now I can't find a way to remove it.  Dummy me for not taking a snapshot because I was in a hurry.  <comment127354> Thank you so much. I had weird rendering issues in 10.8.4 such as AppCode or muCommander not drawing their UI. This driver fixed it. <comment141727> @tlhintoq - what version of mac osx are you using? the mavericks version? <comment141728> It says "OS X 10.8" in the screenshot, which would be Mountain Lion. <comment147083> For what it is worth using OSX on non Apple hardware, virtualized or not, is against the EULA.
