How can I call Don Melton's transcode_video script from a shell script? <body> I'm trying to create a Folder Action to transcode videos using Don Melton's scripts.  When I run the script, codetranscode_video/code complains that HandBrakeCLI is not available, but when I run the command directly from the terminal it runs fine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q5ZWS.png" alt="Screenshot of the automator action"  I'm guessing this is some kind of bash script security thing, but I'm an amateur at this game. Is there a way round this? I've had to revert to calling HandBrakeCLI directly, which is not as easy to optimise.  <answer266579> Two things:  ol liFix your path. This is as simple as adding the following as your first line. I installed the scripts through gem, not git, so transcode_video is in /usr/local/bin - you'll need to set it as appropriate./li /ol  codeexport PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"/code  ol start="2" liMake sure you cd into the directory you want to save the files into, as a step too. Otherwise, writes them out into $HOME, which appears to be the default working directory for automator bash scripts./li /ol  My total working code:  precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" for f in "$@" do     echo $f &gt; /tmp/filename.txt     cd ~/Desktop/SAmple/     transcode-video --mp4 -v "$f" &gt; /tmp/transcode.out done /code/pre  <comment334247> Do you have a link to "Don Melton's transcode video script" to help provide an answer to your question? I'd hazard a guess that the script is calling HandBrakeCLI but the shell which Automator used doesn't include that binary's directory path in its $PATH environment variable.
