Adding Apps to "Security & Privacy" Settings (Automatically) <body> I am looking for a way to automatically add applications to the "Location Services" and "Accessibility" (Mavericks only) lists in the "Security &amp; Privacy" settings pane.  Optimally I could just change some file (eg plist) to add applications to these lists. If that's not possible, there's maybe some terminal and/or AppleScript way to achieve that?  <answer107293> Just found it. The settings are in one of these two files:  ul liSystem-wide settings: code/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db/code/li liPer user settings: code~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db/code/li /ul  They are SQLite databases of the following form:  precodesqlite&gt; .schema access CREATE TABLE access (service TEXT NOT NULL, client TEXT NOT NULL, client_type INTEGER NOT NULL, allowed INTEGER NOT NULL, prompt_count INTEGER NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT key PRIMARY KEY (service, client, client_type)); /code/pre  Example (MS Office and Address Book setting):  precodesqlite&gt; select * from access; kTCCServiceAddressBook|com.microsoft.Word|0|1|0 kTCCServiceAddressBook|com.microsoft.Excel|0|1|0 kTCCServiceAddressBook|com.microsoft.Powerpoint|0|1|0 /code/pre  For other services, just pick the correct service name (such as codekTCCServiceAccessibility/code) and the application bundle ID and add it to the appropriate database.
