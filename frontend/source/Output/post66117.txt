Where can I configure "erase mac" <body> iCloud offers the service to remotely wipe (erase) a mac, as you can remotely erase an iPhone. Where can I change this setting, e.g. disable it?  <answer66126> The emFind My Mac/em feature can be enabled and disabled in the iCloud settings (System Preferences &rarr; iCloud)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbrW0.png" alt="enter image description here"  You cannot disable just the "erase" feature: the locate, lock and erase features must be managed as a single option.
