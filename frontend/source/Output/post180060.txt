How to create a bash alias on OS X? <body> I want to create a bash alias on OS X, because I need to type on a really large command.  I've found some answers about the same issue on ubuntu, like this one, but they mention the ~/.bashrc file, which doesn't exist (at least by default) on OS X.  <answer180061> I've found that I can do this by editing the code.bash_profile/code file.  Just added:  codealias my_alias='cd /my/really/long/long/path/code  to code.bash_profile/code, and after reopening bash my alias command worked just fine.  <comment213737> Is very common to find answers asking you to put the alias in the .bashrc, which you normally won't find in your OS X home directory. And I didn't find any answer stating this difference here in AskDifferent. That was the reasoning for posting this question. <comment256590> A simple search using Google leads to this page now. <comment317654> Great, I was looking for this !
