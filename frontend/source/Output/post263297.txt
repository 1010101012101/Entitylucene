Transfer iTunes playlist to iPhone <body> Could anyone tell me how to transfer a playlist from iTunes (12.5.3) to my iPhone?  I've tried selecting manually manage music, but the playlist does not appear in selection at all.   I've also tried Wondershare TunesGo, but I have the same issue, no single playlist appears for me to select.
