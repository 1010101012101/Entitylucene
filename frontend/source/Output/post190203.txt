Any way to prevent a notification from appearing in Notification Center? <body> I'm writing a simple AppleScript to create periodic notifications, but I don't want those notifications to accumulate in Notification Center. Is there any way to keep them from appearing there, or to expire them, or to delete them?  <answer190207> ol liOpen the notification centre/li liPress the little cog icon on the bottom right/li liFind your application in the list/li liSelect your application and unselect "Show in notification center"./li /ol  <comment225726> Yes, thanks. I was looking for a way to do programmatically, though that could work if it's the only option.
