Errors restoring OSX Lion on a macbook <body> My sister has a late 2007 MacBook running OSX 10.7 Lion. She's managed to acquire quite the collection of adware, so reinstalling the OS seems like the easiest recourse. However, when I boot into recovery mode (holding Command+R as I boot) I get this error when trying to log in with an apple ID (after agreeing to everything and choosing a disk, etc.)  precodeThis item is not currently available. Try again later (not verbatim) /code/pre  One forum post I found suggested I install mavericks first, but it won't install on such an old computer. I also tried using a different Apple ID but it didn't work. Suggestions?
