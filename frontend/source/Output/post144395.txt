Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard on OS X <body> I just bought a Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard. It is supposed to be one of the most ergonomic yet relatively inexpensive keyboard available. It came out late out in 2013.  Microsoft doesn't seem to officially support it even thought it did support its predecessor Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 (see the Mac logo at the bottom of the page).  When I connect the new Sculpt keyboard I am prompted with this screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1Pxi.png" alt="enter image description here"  But as we can see from the next image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LkYEu.png" alt="enter image description here"  there is no key modifier key right next to kbdshift/kbd. Still if I press kbdup/kbd (the only one really to the it), or actually, any other key, I get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lfbu3.png" alt="enter image description here"  After clicking on OK I get the following window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qbP3y.png" alt="enter image description here"  which option am I supposed to choose here? Also, would each of the choices below change how my Mac listens to my keyboard?  <answer144397> According to your screenshot you should press the key on the strongemright side/em/strong of the strongLEFT Shift key/strong (the codez/code key) from the message given:     "Press the key immediately to the right of the Shift key on the strongleft/strong   side of the keyboard that can't be identified."   It looks like you're applying the instructions to key to the right of the shift key on the right.  ul liANSI would be the likely choice for US English/li /ul
