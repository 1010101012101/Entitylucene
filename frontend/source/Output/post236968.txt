iMac (mid 2010, 27") minimum ram slots required to fill <body> Can I use only two 8 GB RAM modules with my mid 2010 27" iMac (2.8 GHz Core I5)? In other words, do you have to fill all 4 memory slots or are 2 filled slots sufficient?  <answer236974> Short answer to your question is strongYES/strong.  But why would you limit the memory given the price of modules today?  According to Everymac.com, your "official" max is 16GB, however you can go all the way up to 32GB.  I personally used Crucial memory modules in my iMac and MacBook Pro with no problems  I would go with 4 8GB RAM Modules (or 2 16GB kits)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LDsx9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment290125> They were sold in configurations with only two slots filled I believe, so yes. <comment290138> Just because it will take 4x8 doesn't necessarily mean it will take 2x16. I'd stay within Everymac's recommendation. <comment290152> @Tetsujin  - 2 16GB kits = 4 8GB SODIMMs <comment290153> That's not particularly clear in your answer. <comment290154> @Tetsujin "I would go with 4 8GB RAM Modules (or 2 16GB kits)"
