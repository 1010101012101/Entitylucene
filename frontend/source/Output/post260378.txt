Slow Keys at log-in screen means I can't access laptop! <body> I have a Macbook Air that's less than a year old and woke up today to an issue.  When logging in, I have to hold each key down for 3 seconds before it'll recognise that I'm pressing it - so it'll end up writing four of the same letter in my password and I have to strategically hold down the backspace for 3 seconds to delete the three extra letters. As you can imagine, it took me about 15 minutes to get it right and actually get in to my laptop.  I followed all the advice on other blogs - the issue is completely gone when I boot in safe mode so it's not a hardware issue as far as I can tell. I did a clean install of OS and problem persisted.  The Slow Keys checkbox is unticked so I just have no idea why this is happening.  I should not that once logged in, the keyboard works perfectly fine!  Any and all advice greatly appreciated!  <answer260414> I know you say the issue is not replicated when booted into Safe Mode, but have you tried resetting the SMC anyway?  For MacBook Airs here’s the procedure for resetting the SMC:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (or power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Hope this helps.  <answer260464> If you did a clean install, that would suggest a hardware issue. It's possible you've got a corrupt install media, too. This can happen if you've created a USB flash drive installer and the USB drive you have doesn't like the block size you've specified (or the default) when using the emdd/em command.  Don't forget to reset the PRAM, as well as the SMC. Apple's instructions:  ol liShut down your Mac./li liFind Command (⌘), Option, P, and R on your keyboard./li liTurn on your Mac./li liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound./li liHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time./li liRelease the keys./li /ol  <comment326049> Have you tested to see what happens when you use an external keyboard?
