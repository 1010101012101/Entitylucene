How is the quality when using a 4k monitor connected to a 2013 Macbook Air via HDMI? <body> I would like to get a monitor for a future PC build but need one now to use as an external display with my 2013 Macbook Air. I am aware that my Macbook Air is not capable of displaying in 4k but I still want to get a 4k monitor, possibly something like an ASUS PB287Q 28", for future applications. I am concerned that the quality of the display when connected to my Macbook Air through a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable will be poor. My question is will the quality be good enough for daily use (mainly internet use and document editing)?  <comment360935> Your MBA will push 2K.  Your 4K monitor will display 2K.  How "good" it is  for *you* for daily use is entirely your opinion.
