Constantly losing pasteboard content on macOS Sierra <body> Ever since I upgraded to Sierra, my pasteboard is no longer reliable.  Sometimes the initial copy/paste works fine, but a minute later when I try to paste the same content again, assuming no further copy attempts since a minute ago, I would find that CMD+v does nothing.  This used to be a Windows-only problem, now I'm sad to see it on Mac too.  I suspect that this has something to do with the new cross-platform clipboard feature.  Can anyone confirm that this is a bug?
