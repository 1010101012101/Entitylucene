There are hacky ways to move music off and onto the devices, but they will always be awkward.   Short answer.  Keep your music somewhere Itunes/Itunes match etc and then move it to the devices as needed.   Note there are workarounds, but staying within the designed way of use is going to simplify your life a lot.
