Authentication Server could not be contacted <body> Our OS X Server machine has had no issue at all with being in the Windows AD domain right up until we updated it to OS X 10.10. Now it behaves bizarrely, refuses to connect to our Exchange mail server, and even rejects the DNS lookup for all of the other servers on the network.  I tried removing and readding the Server to the domain, but I get  "Unable to add server.  Authentication server could not be contacted (5200)"  Is there any way of finding out what the solution may be?
