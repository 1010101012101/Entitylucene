How to view photos from Mac on iPad <body> I have tons of photos on my mac (Lion) and an external harddrive. They are not organized using iphoto, just sitting in different folders.  I would like to be able to view them on my iPad 2. Ideally I would like to be able to "like" them, currently I'm using color labels in Finder.  If I could also view the videos I would be ecstatic ;-)  thanks!   <answer52839> I developed AirPhotoViewer.  It lets you view photos from your PC on an iPad or iPhone over wifi without syncing them on the device.  <comment55475> Do you want to transfer the photos to your iPad or just access them remotely? Is there a special reason you don't use iPhoto? <comment55493> Or a reason you don't use Aperture? <comment55518> I don't want to transfer them. I might use iPhoto if there isn't a simple solution available. <comment60458> Is there also an OS X version of your server available? <comment60465> pretty cool. I would be nice to have a "like" feature that would add a label to the file on the mac <comment61938> the os x version server is release nowï¼Œ thanks for your proposal :)
