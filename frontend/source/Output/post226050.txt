i need to view the contents of an iOS profile on my mac <body> I downloaded a VpnOneClick on my iPhone and then on my mac because they claim once you buy it on iPhone you can use that subscription on mac. I tried this and it does not allow you to. after some further research and talking to their online support staff they claimed that apple regulations do not allow it but their mac plan does work on iPhone. i have tried to enter the address i that i used to download the profile on my phone but it didn't work. i have also tried entering the server details and the account name but i couldn't find out the password. please help me find a way to export the profile used to install the vpns to my mac, i will not try to use it to install the profile on my mac instead i will just look at the information in it.  thank you,  <comment274730> Profiles are just XML documents, no - so you should be able to inspect them and decipher what's up with https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html - also of interest is you can embed bash scripts and other fun items on OS X - see https://github.com/timsutton/make-profile-pkg
