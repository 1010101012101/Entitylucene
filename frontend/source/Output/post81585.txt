How to create ISO from Application Bundle <body> I have Mac OS X Mountain Lion as Application Bundle file. Burning the application to a disk is just like a data disk compilation on Nero.  How do I convert this application bundle into ISO image so that I can burn it on a disk and boot it from there?  <answer81604> Right-click your "Install OS X Mountain Lion.app" file and select "Show Package Contents". Open Contents/SharedSupport and then you will find InstallESD.dmg.  Copy this file to your Desktop. This is the file that you need to burn OS X to a DVD. strongYou need a Dual Layer DVD to burn OS X/or just use a USB flash drive/strong.  It isn't an ISO, but you can convert to a 'cdr' from Disk Utility. A 'cdr' file is the same as an 'iso' AFAIK, and you can rename the extension so that it is an ISO.  <comment94062> What exactly are you after - booting of a CD requires the full OS, allowing to run the application of a CD is much simpler
