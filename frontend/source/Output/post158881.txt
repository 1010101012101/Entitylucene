You have to install at least Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise or Windows Server 2008/2012. (Source)  You might install codeHyper-V Manager/code (probably you did already) though. This application allows to manage codeHyper-V/code hypervisors installed on other computers meeting the above mentioned Operating System requirements.
