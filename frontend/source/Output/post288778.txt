Read iTerm2 last session output history <body> This is probably a long shot but it would be really handy if there is a solution. I am logged in on a work computer I currently cannot access. I know the output of a long running job I previously started is on an iTerm2 window.  I have SSH access to the machine and I would like to read the contents of that window. Is there, e.g., a file where iTerm2 backs up session output? Or any other way to read the content of an open window? Obviously it's too late to select any specific session logging options. Usually after a forced restart, the iTerm2 window will restore the previous output so I presume it is saved somewhere.  <answer288787> This was discussed some time ago on Unix.SE and the bottom line is that there is no general way of doing that, unless you  ul liwant to search for that data in the memory of the terminal process/li liyou want a terminal that support querying for the buffers (some says codexterm/code knows that)/li liYou have your commands running in codescreen/code/codetmux/code/li /ul  I would not like to discourage you nor any other possible answerers. Maybe there is some Apple-specific way I don't know about.  <comment364725> Use `tmux` or `screen` to save the history of terminal sessions. It is usually not possible with generic terminal emulators. <comment364731> @jakuje Thanks, but it's an existing session I want, not a future one. <comment364733> I would also add I have tried grabbing a remote screenshot with screencapture utility and by Applescript to no avail.
