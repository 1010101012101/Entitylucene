Reset all contents and setting with jailbreak (without installing newer iOS) <body> So I have an iPhone 5 with ios 7.0.6 and with jailbreak. I would like to install a clean version of iOS 7.0.6, but with jailbreak you can't do "erase all contents and setting" because the phone will get stuck on the wheel char.  So do I have any way to restore my iPhone to the iOS 7.0.6 ?  I know I can  get into DFU mode and restore from iTunes but i am worried it will force me to install a newer version of iOS  <comment310814> No, there isn't a way.
