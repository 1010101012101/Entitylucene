Running Say Command When Mac Is Logged Out <body> What would happen if I (remotely) ran a codesay/code command on a Mac that's logged out? Would the command run? Or wait until the user logs in to run?  <answer186918> You would either have to wake the computer first, or you'd be locked out if the settings in system preferences disallowed you from such a thing.  <comment220858> Is it possible that it would screw up the system at startup? Or make apps crash? <comment221474> It depends. If you designed it to do so, or coded it so, then perhaps. Just running it as you've described would not cause any errors or 1st party apps to crash. <comment221515> Good to hear. Thank you! I can't give you an upvote yet or click the checkmark. I really appreciate your answers. <comment221806> @FrankDraws you can now
