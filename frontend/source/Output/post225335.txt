InApp Purchase or Custom API for PDF <body> I'm developing an app, and its purpose is sell books like a market.  These books are added and published in my app from my users. My app is only an intermediate selling tool like a market.  When the user buys a book of another user he has available 2 options:  ol liDownload the book in PDF format, in this case he can read book outside from my app (point 11.3 of the apple's review guideline here: http://goo.gl/r7kVb),/li liOr he can decide to receive at his home a printable version that will come shipped at his home./li /ol  In this situation how can I implement the purchase? With in-app purchase store or I can provide a my own system payment?  In this case I tought to implement stripe (https://stripe.com)  I want to avoid being rejected by the Apple Store audit after doing my work.
