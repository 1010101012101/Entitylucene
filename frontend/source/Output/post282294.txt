Why does Time Machine sometimes say it has not backed up? Does it really? <body> We have a 2013 MacBook Pro running Yosemite and a 2015(?) MacBook Air running Sierra. Both use Time Machine to do backups over wifi to an external drive hooked up to an always-on Mac Mini running OS X Server.  From time to time, I click the Time Machine icon in the menu bar, and it will tell me (for example) "Latest backup... Yesterday, 10:55pm", or that it's In Progress, or whatever. And if I enter Time Machine, it does appear to list backup dates and times as I expect -- earlier hours that same day, each of the previous days, etc. Unless I've been traveling and therefore unable to connect to the server, it's emalways/em telling me a backup completed within the last 24 hours. As I expect!  Except that every once in a while, it will pop up an alarming dialog saying "Time Machine has been unable to back up for 2 months" and it will show the last date as February, say, even though I know I've checked more recently than that and never noticed it more than a day since a backup.  What's going on here? Is it momentarily unable to connect to the server and getting confused and telling me it hasn't backed up for a long time, but it really has? Or are the daily backups the ones that are confused? When it says "backed up yesterday 10:55pm", can I be confident that it means a full backup completed and was verified, or does it just mean that it attempted a connection but didn't necessarily complete a backup?  Is there a reliable way to verify that a full backup exists and is up to date on the server? Is a log kept of all the recent backup attempts, and whether they completed or were interrupted? Any insight into what these occasional alarming warnings mean where it claims I don't have recent backups?
