More than two windows split view <body> Is there some sort of clever hack of achieving that, because I did not find anything. I have a 27" Mac and everything is still kind of huge.  <answer228194> No - you get two windows in the current implementation. One on the left and one on the right.   I suppose the notification center slide over could be considered a "third window" but you can't put an application window there - it's just a system tray of sorts.  I would look at a program like Divvy on the Mac App Store for customizing a workspace with multiple tiled windows. It's not split view, but it's far more flexible and able to make use of the 27 inch display space to quite a granular basis.  <answer255506> Hopefully something like this becomes a standard Mac feature.  I like the split screen feature, but sometimes I want/need more than two screens.  I found a pretty good solution on the Apps store that will let you have split screen, one window half/two in quarters, or 4 windows is quarters.   It is called Magnet.  Works great on OSx Sierra, and is much cheaper than Divvy.  Here's the link!  <answer287018> I can recommend:  ul liSpectacle which is free, you can move and expand windows to sides and corners with keyboard shortcuts/li liBetterTouchTool which is paid-for, and includes drag-to-edge to size windows to sides or corners, among many other features/li /ul  <answer295276> @Harry is actually providing a very good recommendation without being very specific about it.  Spectacle does (almost) exactly what you're looking for. It's not strictly speaking split view, but it allows you to split windows between the three third of the screen via simple shortcuts:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lbCnc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  In addition, it's free and open-source.  <answer295279> The app I am now using is Magnet. It is available on the Mac AppStore and performs beautifully. It has shortcuts, graphical buttons and you can drag the windows to the sides of the screen to snap them to halves or to corners to snap them to quarters.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lSSqN.png" alt="enter image description here"
