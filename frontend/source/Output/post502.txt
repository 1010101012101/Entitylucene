Search a phrase using Spotlight <body> I find Spotlight very very useful, however I would like to be able to search for documents that contain a given phrase, i.e. words appearing together, instead of anywhere in a document. Do you know of any way or plugin to perform such a search?  <answer505> From the Mac OS X 10.5 Help     Use quotation marks around text to   search for exact phrases — the same   way you do with most Internet   searches. For example, enter “trip to   France” in the search field to find   items on your computer that contain   that exact phrase. If you didn't use   quotes, the search results would   include items that contain any of   those words.   <comment552> I remembered that, however for a previous version of Mac OS X it was for searching only within file names. Now it is like you said. <comment86629> Broken link. :(
