How to export address book to mailchimp or CSV file? <body> I want to export specific address book groups to mailchimp from a clients Mac computer.  The client have version OS X Lion (10.7) and the Mac she has is faulty and will be scrapped soon. Therefore it is not feasible to upgrade it.  It would be perfect if I could use Chimport but it appears that I need OS X Mountain Lion to use Apple Mac Store to get it.  Alternative do you know any programs that can export to CSV?  <answer122037> Export your contacts as a VCARD bundle from Contacts.app and then import them into a gmail account which supports the VCARD format.  Once in Gmail, you can then export them as a csv file.  <answer126042> The following AppleScript will export all the names and e-mail addresses from Contacts.app. It was written for OS X 10.9 but should work on older editions; you may need to change codeContacts/code to codeAddress Book/code to talk to the appropriate application:  To use this AppleScript:  ol liLaunch strongAppleScript Editor/strong from Applications  Utilities/li liCopy and paste the code below into a new document/li liRun the script/li liOn completion a codecontacts.csv/code will appear on your desktop/li /ol  h2Export Contacts to CSV AppleScript/h2  precode-- Save comma separated values (CSV) file to desktop set exportPath to (path to desktop as string) &amp; "contacts.csv"  set contactsCSV to "" -- variable to collect rows of addresses set quoteString to "\"" -- constant to ease concatenation  tell application "Contacts"      -- Repeat with every person in your Contacts     repeat with x from 1 to the count of people         set thePerson to person x         set theirName to the name of thePerson          -- A person may have multiple e-mails addresses, add one row for each         repeat with anEmail in the email of thePerson             set contactsCSV to contactsCSV &amp; quoteString &amp; theirName &amp; quoteString &amp; "," &amp; quoteString &amp; (value of anEmail) &amp; quoteString &amp; " "         end repeat     end repeat  end tell  -- Write the CSV contents to a file set exportFile to open for access file exportPath with write permission set eof of exportFile to 0 write contactsCSV to exportFile starting at eof close access exportFile /code/pre  <comment81601> The Apple Store is working for OS X Lion as well (if that's really the OS version on your client's computer) <comment81606> I will need to double check the version. Somehow I could not use Apple Mac Store <comment81663> Does this answer your question? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66520/ios-6-facebook-integration-how-may-i-extract-contacts-from-iphone/68669#68669 <comment229939> If one wants to run this script on an older version of OSX where the Contacts app is called 'Address Book' - just change app name in this line like so: `tell application "Address Book"` <comment230367> Also you can copy and paste into Numbers.app. See this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/191558/4160
