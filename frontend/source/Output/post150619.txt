Don't change the default internal input device <body> When I pair with my bluetooth speaker, the input gets changed to Line In  Is it possible to have it not do that?

So we need more info to track why is it changing your Input source to line in? What is your BT speaker model/make? Is there a Console report on the event. What does your about this mac show in the profile for it? <comment177331> Speaker is Big Turtle Shell (http://www.outdoortechnology.com/Shop/Big-Turtle-Shell/) and it has a microphone for hands-free calling... <comment177333> There is your reason why it switches the Input source. So the question is how to disable the BT microphone? Anything in the BT manuals ? <comment177355> No, it's not possible on the speaker side that's why I wanted to know if OSX can be persuaded to ignore this MIC when I use the device as speakers only...
