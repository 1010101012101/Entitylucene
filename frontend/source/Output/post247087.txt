Where did Facebook Messenger OS X notification previews go? <body> Some weeks ago, the way FB Messenger notifications are shown on my installation of El Capitan has changed: The notifications don't include the actual text of the message sent, now they only read "You received a message". I'm not sure what has caused the change, but is there a way to change it back so that the text of the message is included in the notification?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RfpzD.png" width="280"   <comment304846> macOS is for Sierra, not El Capitan. <comment304848> I've seen those on El Cap and the Sierra public beta, so I'm assuming it's something on Facebook's end.
