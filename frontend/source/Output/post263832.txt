iCloud Drive documents won't save <body> Every now and then, my Mac gets itself in a weird state, and will refuse to let me save new files that were created in iCloud-Drive-aware apps.  e.g. create a new 'untitled' document in Byword, attempt to save it to my Desktop, and get an error something like:     "The document "untitled" cannot be saved as "new name". You don't have permission."   Looking at the permissions in both target (~/Desktop) and source (iCloud Drive/Byword) directories, all seems to be well. i.e. my account has read-write access in both.  The 'fix' is to restart, whereupon the permissions (presumably) sort themselves out, it works reliably as expected, until it doesn't. Highly frustrating. Any ideas about a real fix?  hr  2015 11" MacBook Air, running macOS Sierra 10.12.1
