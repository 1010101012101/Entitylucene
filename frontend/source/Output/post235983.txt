Can we use only the bottom mic while recording audio using iPhone 6 <body> For a school project, I need to record a video (60 fps) with audio recorded only from the bottom mic. The default Camera app seems to use all 3 mics while video recording, which creates a distorted sound. Is there a video recording app which allows controlling which mic to use? I am using iPhone 6  <answer236011> Both Filmic Pro and MoviePro lets you select which mic to use for recording.
