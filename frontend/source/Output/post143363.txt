Option + b results in ∫ Instead of Jumping Back a Word <body> Just got a new MacBook Pro and can't seem to recall how to get the emacs bindings to work in the general MacOSX GUI.  On my old Mac codeOption + b/code went back a word and codeOption + f/code went forward a word.  codeOption + d/code deleted a word.    Still works fine in the terminal.  For Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/162896/emacs-on-mac-os-x-leopard-key-bindings  <answer143577> Option-B has always been mapped to ∫ in OS X, and option-B has never been mapped to jumping back a word in emacs. What you're thinking of is the emmeta/em-B shortcut, which is only sometimes mapped to the option key depending on the app. In the Terminal you can enable it by going to Preferences  Settings  Keyboard and checking "Use option as meta key".  You're also probably confusing it with the Ctrl-B keyboard shortcut to jump back one emcharacter/em. That's the emacs shortcut that is available in all OS X apps. You can jump back one word using option-Ctrl-B, delete one word using option-Ctrl-D, etc.  If you want to use option-B and the other emacs shortcuts across all apps, you'll need to install some additional software for triggering the emacs behaviors when pressing the OS X keyboard combinations, as seen in this thread:  Emacsify OSX throughout: word-forward (⌥ + F) and word-backward (⌥ + B) instead of 'special characters'?
