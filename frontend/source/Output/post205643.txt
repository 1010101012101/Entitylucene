iPad mini retina doesn't boot <body> My iPad shows the Apple logo, and then it turns off.  I tried reinstalling iOS with iTunes (update) and it returned error 27?  Any ideas of what to do?  <answer205655> Have you researched error 27: https://www.google.com/search?q=itunes+update+error+27&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari It appears to be a hardware problem, so you may need to go to the Apple Store.  <comment248185> Restoring to factory settings did work, though.
