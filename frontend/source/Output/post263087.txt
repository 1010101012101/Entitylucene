Command key keeps bringing up the Mission Control <body> My Left-Command key keeps bringing up the Mission Control.  I've gone through all the steps in Mac tip: How to restore your keyboard to its default settings to restore all keyboard mappings and shortcuts back to their defaults, but it hasn't fixed the problem.  In TextEditor, I type some text, highlight it, cut it to the clipboard by selecting "Cut &lt;CommandC" from the menu.  If I select "Paste &lt;CommandV" from the menu, the clipboard contents pastes successfully.  But if I try to paste the clipboard contents using the keyboard, by typing &lt;CommandV, nothing pastes, and instead I see a listing of my work spaces appear across the top of the screen, with a '+' at the right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XZ6Ta.png" alt="This is what shows up when I press &lt;Command&gt;"  Any ideas as to what I need to do to get the Command key to work properly?  Mission Control is supposed to be popping up when I press &lt;Ctrl&lt;Up-Arrow, and that's not working, either.  Oddly enough, my Right-Command key works. That still leaves me with a real problem, because I need to VNC into this machine, and every VNC client I've tried only doesn't distinguish between left and right, they only send LeftC-Command.  <answer263088> OK, this one was just stupid.  In System Preferences == Mission Control, there is a section titled "Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts".  For each of "Mission Control", "Application Windows", "Show Desktop", and "Show Dashboard", there is a dropdown where you can select which keyboard shortcut you want to use.  This is separate from System Preferences == Keyboard == Shortcuts == Mission Control.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/65iRL.png" alt="Mission Control"  In my case, it showed that "Mission Control" was mapped to &lt;Ctrl&lt;Up-Arrow.  I changed it to F1, then changed it back to &lt;Ctrl&lt;Up-Arrow, and now it works. Apparently, it had been mapped to  in a way that didn't update the GUI, and switching it to something different and then back fixed it.  I hate this kind of thing.
