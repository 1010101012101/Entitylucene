Moving Bootcamp between drives in the same Macbook <body> I've got Windows 8 installed on a bootcamp partition. Just recently installed an SSD drive and would love to move the the Bootcamp partition to this drive too. Is there anyway I can move it without reinstalling Windows 8 (which cant be easily done since I no longer have an optical drive) or spending $20 for something like WinClone?  Alternatively I could burn the Windows 8 ISO to a USB and reinstall. But would love to avoid reinstalling if possible.  Thanks
