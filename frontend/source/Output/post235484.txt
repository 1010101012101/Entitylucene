Change Spaces on all connected displays at once <body> Just a simple question - my day-to-day setup is a MacBook Pro with 2 connected external displays. I want to try to organize my different "tasks" (writing code, testing/web browsing, and notes) into different Spaces. The keyboard shortcuts to change Spaces only take effect on my currently-selected screen.  Is there a way to change Spaces across all displays at once? If not with a built-in function, maybe a third-party app?  <answer235495> There's a System preference for this, but then it makes fullscreen apps occupy only one screen at a time and the rest of the screens are black. To activate it:  strongPreferences/strong - strongMission Control/strong - uncheck strongDisplays have separate Spaces/strong  reference: Apple site  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jjRHZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment288018> Are you using fullscreen apps? If not: Preferences - Mission Control - uncheck Separate Spaces. <comment288029> Should be the answer @MateuszSzlosek There's no way round fullscreen apps (work of the devil;) so that's the way if not using fullscreen. <comment288045> Thanks! This seems to have done the trick. I use multiple spaces more than I use multiple fullscreen apps, so this is a trade-off I can make. :)
