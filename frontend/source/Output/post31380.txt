Mount root of SMB Server <body> I have a Windows server that I want to backup all the Shares through a script automatically to my MacBook Pro running OSX 10.6.8. There is no common folder all the shares are in, they are just mounted as code\\SERVER\Share_Name/code. I want to be able to have a script that cycles through all the shares on a server (even if the folder names are unknown at the time the script is created), and create a backup on a local folder on my Mac. Or, if there's an easier way than a script, or drag-and-drop (that doesn't seem to always copy all the files)  <answer31460> There's no root in Samba protocol. To list shares on your server you can use codesmbutil(1)/code:  precode$ smbutil view //Administrator@10.211.55.8/ | awk '$2=="Disk"{print $1}' ADMIN$     C$         /code/pre  and then use output with codemount_smbfs(8)/code:  precodesmbutil view //Administrator@10.211.55.8/ | awk '$2=="Disk"{print $1}' | while read sharename; do    mkdir ${BASE}/${sharename};    mount_smbfs //Administrator@10.211.55.8/${sharename} ${BASE}/${sharename}; done /code/pre  Please, read man pages to check other options I haven't used here.  The best utility to make backup I know is rsync(1). You can found it from MacPorts. It'll be interest if you know better.  <comment36076> +1 for the Samba Protocol thing. I did some more reading on it last night, and I saw that part. I like the idea of using a script, but need to still learn more about RSYNC. I will try your script, then mark as the answer if it works. I assume just above the `done` line is where I put my `cp` command? <comment36080> I know that there's some problems with UTF-8 support. I use Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 and have problems with mount non-english shares when use mount_smbfs or Finder. I think it's general Mac OS X problem. And don't forget to make sudo(1) before running this script
