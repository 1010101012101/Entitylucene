Sidebar folder shortcuts all disappeared after update <body> I've just updated from 10.10.1 to 10.10.3 and now all of the folder shortcuts on my sidebar have disappeared, e.g., 'Desktop', 'Downloads'. Does anyone know how to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DhXT8.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thanks  <answer184817> Try Finder prefs  Sidebar - kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd , /kbd - they may just have become unchecked…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/THzma.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any that are still missing after that - previous customer entries etc, can be restored by selecting the appropriate drive/folder/app in any Finder window &amp; hitting kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd / /kbd or File Menu  Add to Sidebar  Perhaps Time Machine would have an older version?br The prefs are at code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist/codebr If you navigate there then enter Time Machine, it may have an older version you could recover  <answer207209> I was able to use time machine and my sidebar got completely restored.   ol liNavigate here/li /ol  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist  ol liSelected that file/li liFrom the time machine menu select "Enter Time Machine"/li liTime machine will take you right to the file you highlighted.

You can manually drag them. So navigate to`/` and then put applications in favorites. Then `/Users/yourname/` and drag Desktop manually <comment219183> @TheBro21 I'm not very keen on recreating each one by one since there were heaps. I wonder if there's a way to restore them. <comment219185> I. think Tetsujin has answered your question :) <comment219187> Well, I guess they're all gone..! Oh well.. <comment219188> Maybe Time Machine… adding new paragraph... <comment249889> Welcome to Ask Different! Great first answer. <comment282262> My shortcut folders were *still checked*, but unchecking and rechecking them caused Finder to suddenly show them again.
