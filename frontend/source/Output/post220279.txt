How to Transfer slo-mo video from one mac to other in photos.app with slow motion edits options? <body> I have a slo-mo video imported from iPhone to my photos app. Now I need to transfer this from photos of my mac to other mac's photo.  I tried by exporting my video as a file in finder and later imported back to the photos app. The slow motion video is working as expected at right timings, but the editing mode is lost. i.e: We cannot alter the timing or frame of the slow motion thereafter.  What can be done if it need to import the video again with the slo-mo frame edit options available.  <answer251663> ol liemIn Finder:/em  ul liCreate a folder for the media you want to transfer./li /ul/li liemIn the Photos app:/em  ol liSelect the media that you want to transfer./li liIn the menu bar, select codeFile &gt; Export &gt; Export Unmodified Original For.../code/li liSelect codeExport/code/li liChoose folder from step one/li /ol/li liTransfer the folder from step one to the Mac where you want to import the photos/li liemIn the Photos app on that Mac:/em  ol liIn the menu bar, select codeFile &gt; Import.../code/li liSelect the folder you exported from step one/li liSelect codeReview for Import/code/li liFollow the dialog./li /ol/li liEnjoy./li /ol  (But do note: If you made a modification to the slow motion segment, it will be reset to the default after export. I'd love for this to be amended, but I suppose we're beholden to Apple for that...)
