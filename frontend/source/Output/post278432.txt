Volume issues (Not working, on some apps works but is very quiet) Macbook Air 13-inch Late 2010 <body> I have a late 2010 Macbook Air that is having volume issues. In some programs, like Chrome, it doesn't play at all, and the only thing I could hear volume on was the SettingsSounds menu. (It was very quiet) I have reset the NVRAM as well, but that didn't seem to fix it. (Side note: The startup sound(s) sounds fine.)  <comment350405> Have you tried resetting the SMC? <comment350428> Did it, didn't fix it,
