Is it possible to share iCloud Notes read-only? <body> I've just written up instructions for my Mum on how to use the AppleTV but I'm scared she's going to accidentally delete the contents of the note. Is it not possible to share a note "read only"?   There's a label saying "People you invite can make changes" but there seems to be no way to edit the permissions before inviting.   Maybe this is coming in iOS 11?  <answer288827> I know this isn't really how you're wanting to solve this, but you could simply compose a note with the desired content, and then either screen cap it or print to pdf and insert the screen cap or pdf back into a shared note, presuming you wanted to keep this content within the notes app.  <comment364700> Not sure if this works, but have you tried locking the note after sharing it? <comment364890> @not2savvy Great idea! However, I just tried it and get `Shared notes can't be locked.`
