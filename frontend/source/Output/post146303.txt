Can't get into my phone after erasing it through iCloud <body> I forgot my restrictions passcode so I looked at some websites and forums who told me to erase my iPhone from iCloud and to backup my iPhone.  I did this but unfortunately, now my iPhone is in lost mode and has been erased from iCloud and I can't get into my phone. How can I get back into my phone or reset it?  <answer146305> You can disable Lost Mode on your device by going to icloud.com/#find, selecting the device and clicking strongStop Lost Mode/strong.  <answer228311> You will have to restore your phone. It will ask for your apple id and password at some point in the restoration process (activation lock). Once you enter that, it will finish restoring, then you can restore your apps and data from an iTunes or iCloud backup.  <comment172375> Yes but how? It just says that the phone has been lost and I should call a certain number <comment172377> I also deleted my device from my iCloud account thinking it would change something <comment172378> @DrunkinLama Ah, you can always restore your device using iTunes. Turn your device off, then connect it to iTunes over USB whilst holding down the home button. <comment172379> Where is Ã©dit? Is it in iCloud?
