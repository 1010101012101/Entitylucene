Reinstall OSX without having firmware password (but having root access to osx) <body> I know that the question can sound suspicius but let me explain. I've installed in end 2015 a frash mac osx. I setted up the firmware password and never used again. Until today. The problem is: I forgot that. I know that I can go to an Apple Store or a certified shop and have it restored, but this requires me a lot of time (I'm far away from Apple Store and the neares shop told me they have to keep it for 10 days beacuse they have other pc to repair first..).  My goal is to reinstall a fresh Mac OSX (I do every year). Is this possible without having the firmware password? I usually do the codeCommand+R/code and the proceed from there, but I can't beacuse I don't remember the password.   I was wondering: if I download sierra installation can I run a fresh installation and erase all data?  PS: With the find my phone I can reset pc, but can I also reset the firmware password (I dubpt so)  <comment339622> [without answering the question at all...] I would wonder why you feel it necessary to nuke & pave every year. My current Mac is a direct line of inheritance since about 2001; even though I've had many Macs in between, they've all been migrations. Not a nuke & pave in 15 years. [It's Windows that needs a good sand-blasting every so often, Macs don't.] <comment339623> because i install a lot of apps to test and this is the easiest way to get rid of them. <comment339624> Then why not [App Cleaner](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/app-cleaner-find-remove-applications/id1013897218?mt=12) or [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) - both freeware. Edit: ah, first one is 'in-app purchase' I use the 2nd one. <comment339625> will try it out.
