How to make custom footer section stick to bottom of page in Pages 5? <body> I'm trying to use Pages 5 to design my invoices. I have a fixed header section for the address and the logo, then a table which is part of the text flow and automatically continues on the next page. However I would like to have a footer area attached to the bottom of the last page which contains my banking information. If the table is short, I would like this information to stick at the bottom of page 1. If the table content becomes longer, I would like to have it at the bottom of page 2.  Possible?  <answer115607> strongThis is currently not possible./strong  You can have it at page 1 and page 2 using a normal footer as you're probably aware, but not emautomatically/em move to the last page of a document. You can do it manually as you're also probably aware by using the section inspector, but that's still not automatic and would require you to delete it from page 1 and then add it back to page 2.  You can notify Apple that you would like this feature implemented using their Pages feedback page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html/li /ul  <comment135280> If the table extends do you want the footer at the bottom of page two *and page one* or just page two? <comment135281> *only* at the bottom of the last page
