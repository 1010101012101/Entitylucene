What API does iStat Menu use? (Mac power system sensors) <body> I am writing a script to procedurally measure certain power system parameters.   I am aware of codesystem_profiler SPPowerDataType/code. However, this API only updates once a minute and sometimes provides quite different results than iStat.   iStat has a number of different sensors for current draw (amperes), all of which update once per second. It also has a power bus (PBus) voltage which updates once per second.  <comment345871> Have you contacted the iStat Menu developers and asked them? <comment346193> A license for iStat menu is at https://bjango.com/help/istatmenus4/licenseagreement/.  They don't want to share their source code.  They may feel like discussing what API they use, but my bet would be against that. <comment346465> I contacted them a few days ago, still waiting on a response.
