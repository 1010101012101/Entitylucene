Sending text to a Terminal or iTerm2 window? <body> How can I send text to a Terminal or iTerm window?  I'm presenting a demo of some multi-user software and would like to create several windows, programatically sending (different) text to each one, something like  precodesend to terminal window 1:  insert into foo values('hello'); send to terminal window 2:  insert into foo values('world'); etc... /code/pre  I'm currently using Terminal and iTerm, but can use any other program.  <answer275128> You can use the Applescript keystroke command.  precodetell application "iTerm" to activate delay 0.5 tell application "System Events"     keystroke "a"     delay 0.2     keystroke "b"     delay 0.2     keystroke space     delay 0.2         keystroke "c" using control down end tell /code/pre  <comment281598> From where (which application) do you want to send the text? Do you want to just display the text or do you want to have it handles as if a user typed it? <comment281600> As if a user typed it.  Context:  imagine a demo with the narration "user 1 adds record foo in window 1, user 2 adds bar in window 2."  I'm guessing there's applescript involved, so I'm open to any program (even a shell script with osascript).
