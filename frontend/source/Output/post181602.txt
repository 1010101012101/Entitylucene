Are you sure the line endings are unix-like and not DOS-style (DOS/Windows produce files with CR+LF at the end, unix tools prefer LF)? <comment215997> `join -1 1 -2 1 (grep -v Year model1_ave.dat) (grep -v Model model1_ave_err.dat)` works :-) <comment216003> Thank you for your addition! So `join` considers the headers in doing the joining. <comment216005> `join` doesn't know about headers in the first place, it just joins (or tries to) lines of text <comment216006> So the parameters `-1 1` and `-2 1` tells to `join` that use the first columns in the files as the pivot point if they are the same. When they were not the same, nothing come out.
