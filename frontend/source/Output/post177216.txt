Problems with the command delete function in applescript <body> I have an applescript that I am using to clear out a huge folder. I can select all of the files but how can I indicate the "command delete" key while keeping all of the files selected? Basically after the "command a function" if I try to preform the "command delete" function it deselects all of those previously selected files.  <answer177232> codekeystroke "backspace" using command down/code    [might be codedelete/code rather than codebackspace/code - auto-deletes are not something I want to be playing with on my first coffee of the day] ;)
