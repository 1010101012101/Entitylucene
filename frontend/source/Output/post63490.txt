Profile Mountain Lion's startup <body> Recently my Mac mini became quite slow without a real apparent cause. I'd really like to be able to trace down the cause of this slowness, and I'd like to do it myself, not using a program.  Is there a good Mac OS X resource website that could lead me to that?  <answer64031> Couple things to try:  ul liStart in verbose mode (Command + V)/li /ul  You'll see a narration of the start up processes.  ul liOpen Console and look at your logs./li /ul  There's lots of things that can lead to slow startups, but I'd be on the look out for permission and network timeout errors.  <comment73408> Is it slow to start up or in normal operation? In the second case, create a fresh user and log in using that user and see if it's still slow. <comment73425> no it's only slow at startup but thing is I would like to be able to trace the cause by monitoring each startup process, like a system profiler or a small script that I would code myself <comment74099> +1 for the word "narration" in this context
