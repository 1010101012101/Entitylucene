Firefox has the Java Applet Plug-in installed and enabled. I don't understand why Java Applets refuse to work in either browser.   What do I need to do get to them running?  <answer80519> Read this on Apple Insider. You probably don't have a Applet plugin installed on your system.   <answer81076> And if you did re-install it, it probably got blocked again the next day due to the malware issue: http://forums.appleinsider.com/t/155735/apple-again-blocks-latest-version-of-java-through-os-x-anti-malware-system  Looks there is a fix for Snow Leopard (see Software Update) but not for Lion varieties...  <comment93490> Does it work in Chrome? <comment93545> Nope, it does not work in Chrome.
