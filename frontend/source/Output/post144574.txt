Getting rid of "The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer" message at startup <body> I have a couple of disks in Windows software mirroring RAID in my system, and when OS X (Mountain Lion) loads, the same message pops up (twice) each time:    precodeThe disk you inserted was not readable by this computer /code/pre  img src="https://i.imgur.com/I8Q8z4A.png"   I know OS X will not initialize Windows dynamic disks, but I cannot find a way to make it forgot them. Is there any?
