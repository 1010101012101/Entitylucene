User permissions problem after restoring from Time Machine to a new user Mac OS X El Capitan <body> My old MacBook Pro died so I did a restore from a Time Machine backup to an iMac. I did the restore to a new user so the info already in the iMac would not be lost. Everything went smoothly and I have a clone from my MB Pro in the iMac.  But now when I try to save a PDF from Safari, the dialog box will not let me create a "new folder" (the button is "greyed out"?) and when I click return a dialog box appear with "Safari cannot export XXXX PDF because you don't have the permissions to do it". I also later found out that it is asking for my password every time I want to move a file from one place to another, or if I want to change a file name.  How do I give full permissions to the new user?  <answer223774> In versions of OS X from Lion (10.7) and newer with a recovery partition, there is an additional Repair Permissions application utility.
