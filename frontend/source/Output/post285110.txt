Does the late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro Support PCI-E SSDs? <body> I'd like to upgrade my late 2013 retina Macbook Pro with a M.2 PCI-E SSD. Is this possible? Do I need an adapter?  <answer285125> As you can see in the image below from ifixit, the 2013 Retina Macbook Pro does have a kind of M.2 PCI-E SSD. (It is the black rectangle the person is holding.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RcGS8.jpg" alt=""  However Apple uses proprietary firmware on those SSDs, so only SPECIFICALLY Mac compatible drives will work such as these these and these.  This Ifixit guide shows you how to install a new drive, and links to a page that lets you purchase a compatible drive.   <comment359537> +1 This is a good answer. Not only does it answer the question, it also provides additional background and explains why it would be pointless upgrading to a M.2 SSD.
