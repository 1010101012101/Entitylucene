Delete cookies in Safari manually <body> I tried deleting Cookies in Safari manually, by deleting code~Library/Cookies/code, code~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/code and code~/Library/Safari/code.  The folders gets deleted, but the next time I launch Safari all cookies are restored. I am logged in all websites.  What did just happen? Why can't I delete cookies?  <answer239476> To delete all your cookies/stored website data in Safari:  ol liOpen Safari/li liOn the menubar at the top of your screen, hit "Safari", then click "Preferences"/li liGo to the codePrivacy/code tab of the preferences menu/li liClick "codeRemove all website data/code"./li /ol  This should remove all the cookies that websites have stored on your Mac.  <answer273442> Yes, there is a way to effectively remove all cookies from Safari via the terminal as well, preventing the auto-restore phenomenon you described. I wrote a simple shell script some time ago to achieve this.   I tested this on macOS 10.12.3 and Safari 10.0.3 and it works.   strongWarning/strong: The tests I did weren't as thorough, meaning: some of the files deleted by this script might not actually be necessary in order to achieve the removal of the cookies, you should trial-and-error your way around it to narrow it down if you like. I personally use the script 'as is', but in your personal situation that might mean you'll lose some data that you actually wanted to keep.   Copy this into a simple shell script and run it (be sure to also copy the 'killall' command):  precoderm -rf ~/Library/Safari/History* rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Auto* rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Downloads.* rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Databases rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/SearchDescriptions.plist rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/WebFeedSources.plist rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Last* rm -rf ~/Library/Safari/Recently* rm -rf ~/Library/WebKit/com.apple.Safari rm -rf /Library/Cookies rm -rf ~/Library/Cookies rm -rf ~/Library/Caches rm -rf /Library/Caches rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/Oracle/Java/Deployment/cache rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/* rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari.* rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/* rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.coreservices.useractivityd.dynamicuseractivites rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/*SpotlightNetHelper* rm -rf ~/.oracle_jre_usage rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sharekit.recents.plist rm -rf ~/Library/Saved*  killall -KILL nsurlstoraged  /code/pre  <comment293978> yes, that is the UI way of doing it I am wondering, why can't I just delete the files manually? <comment293985> @sanjihan you may well have successfully deleted your cookies, but you did not delete your website data cache (I don't think) and you did not turn off Safari's auto fill of your saved passwords.
