how to find out the start time of last sleep <body> Is there a command to find the date and time at which a Macintosh computer last entered the sleep mode?  <answer52065> There may be a more efficient way to get the exact last time, but on lion you can search for codepowerd/code entries in code/private/var/log/system.log/code  If you like terminal, something like codegrep powerd /private/var/log/system.log/code works well. The Console app also has a nice search ability to filter these logs.  If there was no sleep event since the last time the the log file rolled over, you can use Console or codebzgrep/code instead of codegrep/code to search the codesystem.log.*.bz2 files/code.  <answer52076> You can use the codepmset/code command to obtain this information. The following command obtains a log of the sleep/wake entries then restricts this to the last entry in the list which should be the most recent sleep:  codepmset -g log | grep sleep | tail -n 1/code  You can obviously play around with anything after codepmset -g log/code to give you what you need.  <answer84162> Actually, something like  precodepmset -g log|grep -e " Sleep  " -e " Wake  " /code/pre  is what really gives me a clean timeline of sleep/wake events on 10.8.2. powerd does not log anything about it, at least on my system (10.8.2, MacBook Pro Retina 15). The formatting on this site does not do justice to the clean output seen on a shell (that is, given enough width to the window):     02/03/13 19:48:37 GMT-03 Sleep                Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:99%)                              26 secsbr   02/03/13 19:49:03 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:99%)                              27 secsbr   02/03/13 19:49:30 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:99%)                              26 secsbr   02/03/13 19:49:56 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:99%)                              26 secsbr   02/03/13 19:50:22 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:99%)                              26 secsbr   02/03/13 19:50:48 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:99%)                              26 secsbr   02/03/13 19:51:14 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:100%)                             1802 secs    02/03/13 20:39:17 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using BATT (Charge:100%)                           244 secsbr   02/03/13 20:43:21 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:100%)                             51 secsbr   02/03/13 21:07:17 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using BATT (Charge:100%)                           242 secsbr   02/03/13 21:11:19 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:100%)                             1103 secs    02/03/13 21:29:42 GMT-03 Wake                   Wake due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using AC (Charge:100%)br   03/03/13 00:00:26 GMT-03 Sleep                  Idle Sleep Sleep: Using BATT (Charge:85%)                                   96 secsbr   03/03/13 00:02:02 GMT-03 Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:85%)                              38 secsbr   03/03/13 00:02:40 GMT-03 Wake                   Wake due to EHC1/HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:85%)                        4338 secs    03/03/13 01:14:58 GMT-03 Sleep                  Clamshell Sleep to DarkWake: Using AC (Charge:100%)                         48382 secs   03/03/13 14:41:20 GMT-03 Wake                   DarkWake to FullWake due to HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:100%)            728 secsbr   03/03/13 14:53:28 GMT-03 Sleep                  Clamshell Sleep to DarkWake: Using AC (Charge:100%)                         415 secsbr   03/03/13 15:00:23 GMT-03 Wake                   DarkWake to FullWake due to HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:100%)            718 secsbr   03/03/13 15:12:21 GMT-03 Sleep                  Clamshell Sleep to DarkWake: Using AC (Charge:100%)                         156 secsbr   03/03/13 15:14:57 GMT-03 Wake                   DarkWake to FullWake due to HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:100%)            834 secsbr   03/03/13 15:28:51 GMT-03 Sleep                  Clamshell Sleep to DarkWake: Using AC (Charge:100%)                         378 secsbr   03/03/13 15:35:09 GMT-03 Wake                   DarkWake to FullWake due to HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:100%)               <answer223645> You can also use codepmset -g log | grep LidOpen/code if you want to know when the lid of your MacBook was opened.  <comment59543> I don't get any results for `powerd` in any of the system logs, could I be missing some setting for logging `powerd` activities? <comment59553> hey thanks that worked! just changed the `grep` command to `grep -2 sleep` to get the line with the date and time. <comment59573> If you sleep and wake and that doesn't show, then you might just look at the file at the exact time you slept the mac to see the messages your mac is making. <comment59574> Oh yes, now that's what I'm talking about. Precise sleep info and not some log file grepping hoping to catch a hint of sleep. :-) <comment59617> `grep sleep` might also match other lines. Something like `pmset -g log | grep -E '^.{24} sleep  '` should probably be used in scripts. <comment59618> @Lri Agreed. I did lash the original command up in about 5 seconds and is also why I added the last sentence ;-) Thanks for the correction. <comment192543> This is great, ta!! <comment219367> Not working for me. It prints out incorrect date <comment259571> Use `pmset -g log|grep -e " Sleep  " -e " Wake  " -e " DarkWake  "` for all wakes including `DarkWake`'s <comment301337> This worked for me on 10.11.5: `pmset -g log | grep "Display is turned off" | tail -1`
