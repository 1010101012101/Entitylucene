Location of "start at login" items? <body> I have quite a few apps (Glui, Wunderlist, Cobook) that startup at login (which I do not want them to). I do not have them among the user's login items and when I created a new test user, these apps do not start.  I also checked in LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons (both system and User) and can't find these items there.  Where else can I look? I tried removing all the com.apple.loginwindow.* items from code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/code and still these items start at login.  <answer126160> The following list might help you to disable some program at startup :  ol liThose in emSystem Preferences » Accounts » Login Items/em (actually, these include the ones from 1.)/li liThe login hook for codeloginwindow/code described here, read current value with codedefaults read com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook/code/li liSome of those specified as part of a codelaunchd/code script (or otherwise managed by codelaunchd/code). List all with codesudo launchctl list/code. See codeman launchctl/code for details./li /ol  Regarding the codelaunchd/code lists, you can see their definition files in the codeLaunchAgents/code and codeLaunchDaemons/code subdirectories of your system's codeLibrary/code directories:  ul licode/System/Library/code (you probably shouldn't touch these)/li licode/Library//code (usually for all users)/li licode/Users/yourname/Library/code (your own programs)/li /ul  In the latter two libraries, check for anything suspicious. It's usually XML, so you can open and read them.  <answer265727> These apps could also be starting simply because they were the last items running when your account logged out, if you have the "reopen applications upon login" option checked.  <comment147726> Thanks for the tips, I already checked all these locations and can't find anything! Any other tips? <comment147727> @fnurl could you tell us which programs are starting ? It might help
