Use Automator to drop one letter in the naming <body> I've a kind of download-setup on my Mac and it does an excellent job downloading all the files I need. But for some reason the setup is renaming my files with "emTitle 9x88 Name/em". And I would like to drop this one "x" whenever a new files is detected in the directory.  Everything works perfect in Automator, except for the dropping the 1 letter.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BlsLS.png" alt="enter image description here"  I know Automator doesn't support wildcards, but is there any other way in how to drop the single emX/em in the naming?br I'm open for every creative solution (shell scripts too).  <answer110402> You could use a Run Shell Script action like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fp5U0.png" alt=""  codefor f in *;do [[ $f =~ (.+ [0-9]+)x([0-9]+ .+) ]]&amp;&amp;mv "$f" "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}${BASH_REMATCH[2]}";done;exit 0/code  Or if the filenames don't contain other x characters, you could replace the script with codefor f in *;do mv "$f" "${f/x/}";done/code.  <comment130016> Perhaps solving the root problem - why the file gets renamed with a 'x' in the middle - would be a better exercise than writing a kludgy work-around. Tell us what the download setup is and perhaps we can all tackle it together. <comment130052> It's Sickbeard. But I don't know if this issue is discussable on this forum :) <comment130075> Indeed ... perhaps not. Another solution would be to look at the utility app A Better Finder Rename, or learn a bit of regex and some shell scripting.
