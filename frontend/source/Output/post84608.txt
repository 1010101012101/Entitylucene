How to save half-made service in Automator? <body> How to save half-made service in Automator without making it active, as it is not finished?  <answer84611> It does not matter if it's unfinished. Doing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdS/kbd will save it under code~/Library/Services/code.  Taking the Service out of code~/Library/Services/code and restarting Finder (if you want immediate effect) will make this Service not to be shown under strongMenu / Services/strong. Putting it back will, of course, make it appear again.  It does not matter where the file is placed, you'll be able to open it with strongAutomator/strong to continue editing it.  <comment97428> It'll be accessible in menu/Services although it doesn't work, which is what I want to avoid at the moment. <comment97429> Taking the Service out of `~/Library/Services` and restarting Finder will do the trick. Putting it back will, of course, make it appear again under **Menu / Services**. <comment97441> You mean- if the Service file is saved somewhere else it won't appear in **Menu**, but it can be open with Automator, right? Could you this time edit your answer directly?
