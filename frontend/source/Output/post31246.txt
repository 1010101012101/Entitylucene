Is there an easy way to reduce quality of .mov files taken from an iPhone? <body> I've noticed the small movies I take on my iPhone 4 result in large .mov files. For example, a 1 minute movie results in almost a 100MB .mov file. This is running through my cloud storage (Dropbox) rather quickly. Is there an easy way to reduce the quality/size after transferring to my Mac?   <answer31254> Have you seen this other question / answer?

You can do exactly same automator workflow but make it an Image Capture plug-in. So you can choose in "Image Capture" videos from your iOS device and import them transcoded.  Really easy steps are presented on macworld.com, basically you use  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CF75z.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  and import your movies using Image Capture.  If you check the box [Show this action when the workflow runs] you will be able to choose destination folder and compress options.
