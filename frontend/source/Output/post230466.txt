Get iPad Restriction Password <body> Before this is immediately down-voted, I would just like to say this is a slightly different question. My iPad has restrictions put on it and I really would love to get the password. The reason I did not wipe the iPad is because someone else put the restrictions and I would not want them finding out I disabled the password. I saw a post on the apple forum saying to navigate to adoptions.plist but could not find the correct password.  This is the Forum (Response by Tikara_NZ). I saw a line 3552 which did not end up the correct password. Thinking that maybe I can delete the password, I deleted the adoptions.plist from my computer and restored my iPad. There was no change. It still had the password and everything is running perfectly. Is there a specific way I can decode it from the backup? A certain line of code I should search for on my computer?  Thanks,     Jack  <comment281399> To my knowledge, you just can't. That's the point of restrictions. I won't post this as an answer, since there may be others who know further. <comment281409> Okay thanks for the response
