My Mac is invisible to my iPhone on AirDrop <body> I want to send a photo from my iPhone (iOS 8) to my Mac (Yosemite) via AirDrop. Though my iPhone appears on my Mac, Mac does not appear on iPhone. How can I fix this?  On both devices, I've selected "Allow me to be discovered by: Everyone".  <answer203061> I find that when AirDrop stops working even when both devices are within bluetooth range and on the same Wi-Fi network, I often have to reboot both devices. There may be another way, but rebooting both has almost always fixed it. Also of note: if you have any firewall enabled, those settings can interfere as well.  <comment244922> For what it's worth, I have had this happen far less while using 10.10.5 and iOS 9. <comment249016> I'll also note - interference on set WiFi channels will cause the bluetooth and WiFi discovery process that AirDrop uses to be unreliable. The good news is that the transfer will also be unreliable under that interference, so it's a realistic failure from a system's design standpoint. Think of it like a red light - AirDrop doesn't give you a green light until it can link up under decent or better network conditions.
