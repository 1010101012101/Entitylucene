Please help me recover my ringtones after an iPhone restore <body> I downloaded ringtones from iTunes a couple weeks ago.  I don't think I ever synced my iPhone since, but I did have to reset my iPhone due to an application crash.  When I got my iPhone restored from a backup, my ringtones were gone and the only way to prove that I ever had them was through the receipt that Apple sent to my email account.    I tried finding them on "purchased" in my iTunes account but there was nothing there.  How can I retrieve my ringtones?  <answer40613> Found over here:  With iPhone connected to computer:  ul liIn iTunes menu select "Store," then "Deauthorize Computer"/li liThen select "Store," then "Authorize Computer"/li liA message will pop up saying "X out of X Computers are Authorized" or something to that effect./li liSync iPhone/li liRestart iPhone, go to settings, sounds, ringtones. Purchased ringtone should be on top. /li /ul
