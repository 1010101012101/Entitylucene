How to get the cellular APN on iPad? <body> I'm using iOS 5.0.1 on an iPad 1 and want to look at the APN settings.  This article from Apple http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2283 says that I should be able to see them through Settings  Cellular Data  APN Settings.  But when I go to Settings  Cellular Data, the only options are to turn data and roaming on and off, to view the account (which opens AT&amp;T's account info) and an option to set a PIN on the SIM.  What is the APN information for an AT&amp;T 3G ipad and/or how can I see it on my device?  <answer55103> I can see my APN settings in:  Settings - Mobile Data - APN Settings  Perhaps your carrier locks this down?  <answer55104> If your carrier provides these settings on the SIM, then you won't be able to see or edit them as it's auto configured.  <answer128177> If your carrier supports editing APN settings you can set settings using the instructions found in this site: http://apn.gishan.net/platform_11_ipad__(default)_.php  Choose your network there and get the settings.  <comment63511> What carrier do you have? <comment63524> I am on an MVNO attached to O2, a UK carrier.
