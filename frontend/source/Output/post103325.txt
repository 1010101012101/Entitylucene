Exporting CSV with Numbers with different languages <body> I am exporting a file from Numbers to CSV and it contains language other than English, like Japanese or Russian.  After I export the CSV, all these funny characters shows up in the CSV.  Is there a way to fix that so Numbers can export as it is.  Thanks for your help  <answer214123> Make sure that you set the text encoding to UTF8  <comment121617> How exactly are you confirming that there are "funny characters"? I'm betting whatever you're opening the CSV in simply doesn't get the encoding right. <comment121620> Exactly, once i exported from Numbers or Excel to a CSV file, I open the CSV, all these funny characters showed up instead Japanese or Russian.  How can "get the encoding right?" <comment121623> How are you "opening" it? What application?
