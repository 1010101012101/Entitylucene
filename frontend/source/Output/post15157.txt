How to default UTF-8 encoding in Text Encoding in Mail.app? <body> I'm using Mail.app.  Often times I would write on reply emails typed in foreign language (Chinese, Japanese), and the receiver will see garbled text (e.g. a bunch of ??? or squares).  The way I solve the problem is: before sending each of these reply email, I go to "strongMessage/strong" - "Text strongEncoding/strong" - select "strongUnicode/strong *emUTF-8/em*". But as soon as the email is sent, text encoding is set back to "Automatic". On my next email, I have to set the text encoding again to UTF-8.   This is annoying. Is there a way to set UTF-8 as default text-encoding, and not Automatic?  <answer15162> Open Terminal.app and type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail NSPreferredMailCharset "UTF-8" /code/pre  If it does not work, you can revert by using  precodedefaults delete com.apple.mail NSPreferredMailCharset /code/pre  <answer19631> One way to ensure all your email goes out as UTF-8 is to include a Unicode dingbat or similar character in every message, as part of your signature or otherwise.  <answer104236> It's really odd there is no "standard"/"normal" way to set the default encoding to a user's choice.  By adding a Unicode dingbat character in a signature is more like a trick. The terminal command solution is not working. Even if it's working, it's very odd for a user to set something like this.  I can't believe Apple lets this happen.  It's the most annoying thing after I changed to use Mac. I have to choose the encoding every time I send an email. How ridiculous!  <comment16461> no, it doesn't work. Tried both, and back and forth, and it's still showing "Automatic"!! <comment16463> Did you try to send an email? It didn't change the value on my computer either, but it might still work. <comment18007> no it still doesn't work. a pile of squres and ?? still.. <comment26284> This does not work with the last version of Mail.app (as release in Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1). Unfortunately ... <comment28964> What is a unicode "dingbat"? what is a "dingbat"? <comment122715> Does the email you are replying to have an encoding? <comment135912> works in Max OS X Mavericks 10.9.1
