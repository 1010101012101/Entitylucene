Chromatic Aberration with Mac Mini <body> I recently bought a Mac Mini Late 2014 intermediate version of the three available. I have the following issue.  Sometimes when I turn the Mac Mini on or from standby I get this chromatic aberration  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/300V0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TM1Tz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  After a reboot everything comes back to normal. In the beginning I thought it was an hardware problem so I went back to the Apple Store and they changed my Mac Mini. However when I plugged in the new one it gave me the same problem! I also tried to test this effect on 3 different monitors and I got the same issues.   Maybe is it something related to the Thunderbolt - VGA adapter or the VGA cable? Or is it something related to software?  <comment194882> Have you tried using another adapter/cable? <comment194883> Not yet indeed! Also because the vga / thunderbolt adaptor works fine my 15inch retina late 2013. But it is something that I should definitely try! <comment194884> You could also try booting the Mac Mini in safe mode by holding shift when booting. I don't think this will change anything, but it's worth a try. Priority would be testing different cables.

Have you gone to the Displays in System Prefs and reset the profile after updating to Mavericks? I had to do that on my mini. <comment194930> So did you have the same issue? I bought the mini directly with Yosemite. However I'll try to see if your approach works. <comment194967> Profile changed on me when I *updated* to yosemite. In your case the Mac may have just auto-chosen an innapropriate profile.
