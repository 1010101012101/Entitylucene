Connecting to FTP, directory seems to be blank <body> I need to transfer some files into a guest computer in VirtualBox, and I think FTP would be a good way, but am having trouble connecting the two "computers".  I tried running:  precodesudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist /code/pre  then running:  precodeifconfig | grep "inet " /code/pre  and grabbing the address returned that wasn't 127.0.0.1.  I even downloaded the FTPD Enable app, but when I visit codeftp://192.168.1.119//code in a browser it's just an empty directory.  Is there a setting in Preferences - Sharing I need to set, or is the FTP leading to a directory somewhere that might just be empty?  When going to higher level directories, (codeftp://192.168.1.119/../../../../../../../../..//code), they all look the same.  I wouldn't think it should be necessary to install OSX Server for this.  <answer154519> Okay so to move files btwn host and guest (virtualbox) i was able to set up ftp on the host as noted above and access the host from the guest either via browser by doing:  precodeftp://username:password@192.168.1.119 /code/pre  Substituting username and password with my user/admin username and password.  OR (even better) simple from the command line:  precode$ ftp 192.168.1.119 Connected to 192.168.1.119. 220 192.168.1.119 FTP server (tnftpd 20100324+GSSAPI) ready. Name (192.168.1.119:username): my_username 331 User my_username accepted, provide password. Password: User my_username logged in. Remote system type is UNIX. Using binary mode to transfer files. /code/pre  The the commands within the ftp interface are mostly quite similar to bash/unix commands.  precodeftp&gt; cd Sites/mzoo 250 CWD command successful. ftp&gt; cd mglitch 250 CWD command successful. ftp&gt; ls 500 Illegal PORT command rejected ftp: bind: Address already in use /code/pre  Hey! What happened there? We have to go into passive mode:  precodeftp&gt; passive Passive mode on. ftp&gt; ls 227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,1,119,194,210) 150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for '/bin/ls'. total 1 -rw-r--r--   1 my_username  staff  12292 Jun 25 21:45 .DS_Store rw-r--r--   1 my_username  staff    252 Jun  5 15:13 .htaccess /code/pre  get will retrieve a single file and wget will get files matching request. for example:  precodeftp&gt; lcd audio # changing to local directory "audio" Local directory now /home/username/bla-bla-audio ftp&gt; mget *.mp3 /code/pre  Here's a list if basic ftp commands.  Command to turn off ftp on the host is:  precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist /code/pre  <comment181275> actually solved it based on comment from http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/110965/connect-to-ftp-server-in-finder-not-working, but I think might be useful to leave for others. have to connect like this: `ftp://username:password@192.168.1.119`
