Yosemite Kernel panics involving com.apple.driver.AppleUSBCDC <body> I have experienced 5 kernel panics over the last few months. Using a mid-2012 MacBook Pro running Yosemite 10.10.4.  I have reinstalled Yosemite and have erased, repartitioned and reinstalled. I have been on the phone to AppleCare and have had a Genius run diagnostic tests, nothing found. No one has yet looked at the logs.  The only thing I can find in the logs that is common to every kernel panic is that the last loaded and/or unloaded kext in every case has been:   com.apple.driver.AppleUSBCDC    4.2.2b5  or    com.apple.driver.AppleUSBCDC   4.3.3b1   Does anyone have any ideas as to what the problem might be?  Thanks for reading.  <answer197702> Let me guess: the kernel panics appeared with the 10.10.3 update? Well, then I am 98% certain it is a bug in OS X Yosemite. Welcome aboard. The kernel panics are totally erratic, some users have also graphics glitches. The only common feature is having a Intel HD 4000 GPU.  On MacBook Pros with dual GPU you can avoid the problem by strongdisabling Automatic Graphics Switching/strong (System Preferences  Energy Saver).   After countless phone calls with Apple, I will take my Mac to the Apple Store tomorrow. I am sure they won't find a thing. Then they will keep my Mac for five days, replace the logic board and the issue will persist. Please proof me wrong Apple...  Please contribute to the thread in the apple discussion forum and file a bug report (with link to the thread).   <comment236403> Correct. In fact the issue first appeared for me right at the end of the 10.10.3 installation process. I also have the Intel HD 4000 GPU. So 10.10.4 hasn't fixed it? <comment236404> No :( Apparently the beta of 10.11 does. Please contribute to the Apple discussions forum and file a bug report. <comment236406> Ok, thanks - will do. <comment236477> almost forgot. On MBPs you can disable graphics switching. I did not have kernel panics since then. Your case is interesting since you have a consistent process popping up in the log. Most people have no log or a different process every time. <comment236482> I do not have that option as my Mac only has one GPU. <comment236808> Update: Because of the consistent mention of USBCDC, Apple phone support thought my issue might be caused by a USB peripheral. I have a USB hub (a very inexpensive one) and two hard drives connected most of the time. I plan to disconnect the peripherals one at a time and then test. Hope to keep the thread updated - see you in 53 days!
