Can I stop Dropbox from automatically updating itself on OS X? <body> Dropbox seems to auto-update itself on OS X. Problem is that the latest version of Dropbox doesn't support OS X 10.10.0 which I have to run for compatibility with other apps.   I tried re.installing an older version of Dropbox, which then works for a few minutes before it updates itself again.  Is there a way to stop Dropbox from updating itself so I can stay with an older version of Dropbox?  <answer173926> Your may try moving it from code/Applications//code to code/Applications/Utilities/code. Dropbox does not automatically updates when I keep it in codeUtilities/code folder.  <comment269664> This suggestion worked for me, but when I double clicked the dropbox icon inside the utilities folder nothing would happen.... however if you right click and show package contents, and  contents  MacOS  dropbox that will open, and so far it has not tried to upgrade! <comment332562> When I did this, Dropbox launched okay and so far hasn't updated, but: 1. I have to keep the Terminal window open and 2. the Terminal window reports an error `NSFCString autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking`. <comment332563> Correction. It still updated even when running from inside package contents. Then quit. I'm now looking at https://www.pcloud.com/ (20GB free)
