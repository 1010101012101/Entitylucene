Brand new Macbook Pro retina fail Memtest <body> I have a brand new MacBook Pro Retina (8GB, 256GB SSD), which has experienced some issues for past few weeks.  I decided to run memtest after a complete OS X reinstall.

Execution time: 512 seconds. /code/pre  The guys at the Apple Store are sure there is no problem with the RAM.   strongSo why Memtest is failing ? Is it normal ?/strong  <answer152237> As you said in the comments :   ul liMemtest is failing /li liApple Hardware Test indicates a possible memory failure /li /ul  This a clearly a bad indicator for your memory.   The fact that a premium reseller is not taking your MacBook Pro for some obscure reasons would make me call a huge bulls**t.   They have to take if it's defective !   <comment178865> I would say, go back to them and show them your memtest. <comment178954> I would, but they say memtest results are not relevant, because it's not Apple certified. <comment179032> What does the Apple Hardware test says ? <comment179094> Before the complete MacOs reinstall, it said that one memory module could be defective. After the reinstall, it says there no issue. <comment179142> Well, now, it says again that a memory module could be defective. I went back to the Apple Store this morning : Memtest is not relevant, and Apple Hardware test neither. What can I do ? <comment179144> Did you went to a regular Apple Store or a Premium reseller ? <comment179149> Premium Reseller, does that matter ? (the closest regular Apple Store is 250km far from me) <comment179150> Yeah imho, they are bullshiting you (excuse me the expression), a Genius would have took your MBP right away. <comment179153> I can only agree with you, but what can I do ? Go to the nearest Apple Store (but I'm not sure they will do something), or harass my Premium Reseller ? <comment179154> Actually, when they run their tests (the guy at the store show me, it takes 10 sec to make it), it shows nothing. <comment179171> 10 secondes for a memory that basically no test. Overclocking-addict make memory tests of multiple hours to ensure their system is rock-stable. <comment179179> That's what I said to the "tech guy". But well, no success :) <comment179236> Well, this Macbook was sent by an insurance that I have on my previous Macbook. So I called the insurance again, and they said they made a mistake saying me I had to contact Apple for this Macbook. They will take care of it, by sending me another one (when I will send this one back). I hope this will work. Anyway, thank you for your help :) <comment179831> Well, the insurance told me finally to deal directly with Apple :), so I'm back to the beginning, and I planned to go to the nearest Genius Bar (Nantes). <comment179893> I'm french, just to know, who was your Premium Reseller ? <comment179981> IP Store, Poitiers. <comment181685> Finally, your answer was the good one : I went to the Apple Store Nantes, the Genius saw my memtest and took it back for repair. 2 hours later, it was done :)
