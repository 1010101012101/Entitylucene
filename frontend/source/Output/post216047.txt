Using apple watch + nike + running without the phone <body> I have seen this question and there generally very little information  on this topic. In the question linked above the they talk about the activity app. I use nike+ running. Last time I went for a run I ran for some time with my phone in my pocket, then I ran without it and the watch would not pick up the distance or any other info during the run. I started the run from my watch so I thought it should not be problem. Has anyone figure this one out yet?  <answer216057> I think Apple's included Workout app can record activity and heart-rate data without the iPhone, but the Nike+ Running app can't (as of the 17supth/sup of November 2015).  Here's the info page from the iPhone Nike+ Running app (emNike+ Running  Settings  Apple Watch/em)..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p7KWN.png" alt="Screenshot of Nike Running app (v4.8.3) on iPhone"  Nike state that you need to have your iPhone on you.  <comment261246> that is pretty sad, hope apple guys are going to allow more access to developers in the near future. thanks for your answer <comment261426> I hope so too. Apple recently provided a way [to sync and play music from the Watch to bluetooth headphones](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204691) and the example they give is a 'Workout Playlist' so they're adding capabilities a bit at a time  :o)
