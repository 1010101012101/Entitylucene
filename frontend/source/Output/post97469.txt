Where can I look up purchase/activation date for Apple products? <body> I can't remember exactly when it was I bought my iPhone.  I thought that perhaps I could look it up via Apple somehow.  I'm aware of the Check Your Service and Support Coverage page, but that's not presenting me with the activation dateâ€”only the status of my warranty and such.  <comment189477> Same here: I get a statement that it's been greater than a year when checking a desktop Mac, but no details.
