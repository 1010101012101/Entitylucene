How to get long decimals from functions in Numbers? <body> I am using Numbers on OS X to help me with a GIS project; I have created a .CSV file that describes a polygon in terms of the distance and bearing between any two consecutive vertices.  Using the functions in Numbers, I first converted the distances and bearings into X- and Y-offset (∂x, ∂y) values, and then converted these values into actual vertex coordinates that I want to import into my GIS platform.  My X- and Y-offset values are accurate to 12 decimal places. The problem I am encountering is this: when Numbers uses these values to calculate the actual coordinates, it returns the coords as numbers with only 9 decimal places. As these coordinates represent real-world spatial data, it is important that I have the additional accuracy contained in those 3 extra decimal places!  I tried changing the cell format to allow for more decimal places, but this simply tacks more zeroes onto the end of the string, without increasing the precision of the value.
