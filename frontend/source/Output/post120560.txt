Character encoding issue with mail merge using Outlook and Word 2011 <body> I'm using Word 2011 to generate a mail merge to Outlook 2011 (it has an Excel datasource, but I don't believe that is specifically relevant).   I consistently get some characters that show up as ?? in Outlook. At first it was the apostrophes, so I turned off the autocorrect that substituted in the correct apostrophe character. This last time it was random white space.  I would expect Microsoft's office suite to work together nicer then this. I don't see anywhere to tell them to use the same codepage or character encoding. I'm not terribly attached to using Outlook and Word, but Pages doesn't seem to support mail merge at all.
