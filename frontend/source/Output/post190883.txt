How to solve "User is not in sudoers file, incident reported" <body> I added   precode"Syammala Naidu" ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  to code/etc/sudoers/code, rebooted and logged in as Syammala Naidu and run codesudo -i/code. Sudo tells me: codeuser not in sudoers file, incident Reported/code.   How can I fix this?  <answer190884> codesudo/code exclusively uses account names, not the user's full name. As a hint, strongaccount names don't contain spaces/strong, so "Syammala Naidu" is not correct.  To find out a user's account name:  ol liOpen System Preferences./li liSelect Users &amp; Groups./li liIf necessary, click the lock on the bottom left corner of the window and type an administrator's name and password to unlock the preference pane./li liRight-click the account and select codeAdvanced Options.../code./li liLocate the codeAccount name/code property:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TqdUk.png" alt="enter image description here"  Use that account name in code/etc/sudoers/code. To edit the file, use codevisudo/code. For more information, check man visudo and man sudoers./li /ol  <comment226661> https://xkcd.com/838/ <comment226662> is this an answer @CousinCocaine <comment226664> Or look at the name of the home folder, the account name is the part after `/Users/` :-)
