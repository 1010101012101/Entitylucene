Google Chrome empty Finder window <body> Today without (yet) no evident change in my working Mac running Mountain Lion (10.8.5) I saw at least 10 times an empty window pop up on top of my working environnment.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rlsm4.png" alt="Google Chrome empty window".  At each of these events, I noticed that the window in which I was typing lost the focus and consequently what I was typing.  After a few quick investigation I found that this empty window is a Finder window and is clearly related to error messages within:  precode~/Library/Logs/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.log /code/pre  as this typical one:  pre 2014-09-25 12:16:23.302 GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent[24197/0xb0289000] [lvl=3] KSDiskImageHDIUtilRun() KSDiskImage hdiutil execution (status: 1): "/tmp/KSDownloadAction.sQtnQHG3Yu/com.google.Chrome.dmg"         STDOUT:          STDERR:                 hdiutil: attach failed - no mountable file systems /pre  I don't use the Chrome web browser. brI installed it one year ago to test it from time to time. brI didn't use it recently. hr What may be causing these Google Chrome empty Finder windows? brDid someone noticed the same spyware-like behaviour? brDoes someone see any way to investigate this suspicious behaviour?  <answer168384> Here is the way I removed this automatic upgrade which never explained me what was going on.

Somehow the disk image of the Chrome installer is being opened.  You could probably resolve the issue simply by finding and deleting the .dmg file.  (Of course this won't uninstall GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent however)
