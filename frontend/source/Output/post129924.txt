Can't trace origin of corrupted preference file <body> I keep getting a corrupted preference file that auto-regenerates. I can't seem to pin it to any recent downloads and google has not been my friend.   org.stereovision.exploration.plist   Can't tell if it is having any knock-on effects but as it does not appear in any console logs I am assuming that it is having no ill effects.  Regards Pat  <comment152156> Can you change the permissions on the file so it is read only - the the program writing to it should complain - Although I would expect only one program reads it and that is the one which also writes it <comment152208> What i've done is delete all the info within the plist file via textwrangler. So far no evidence of any harm, but it is early yet. <comment152261> Which directory are you finding the plist in? <comment152321> /Volumes/user/Library/Preferences <comment153541> Deleting info contained within file didn't work longterm so I have changed permissions on the file to write only, as mark suggested, and that seems to have done the trick. Still can't find source or associated app! <comment153639> oops that didn't work either
