Is there an application to analyze this which application created a generic process in ram? <body> I noticed a generic "Java" process is using between 1-2GB of Ram after I upgraded to Mountain Lion. I know a lot of the apps I use require java. I have closed out all my apps and still it is using 1-2GB.   Is there some way to view what application is requiring the use of that much ram for java? Is there an application to analyze this further to narrow down the issue?
