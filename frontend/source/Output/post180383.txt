Does the new photos app still try to recognise faces? <body> Will the new photos app still try to guess who everyone is in all my photos? I'm really hoping this is one emfeature/em that was deprecated!   hr  strongFYI/strong if anyone is wondering, I personally did not like this feature because it consumed at lot of CPU and kicked my fans up to 100% with no way to limit or control the process.  <answer180385> Yes, there is a Faces album which will show all recognised faces in your images.  <comment215783> And it will let you keep recognizing faces if you want to.
