Mac Pro Dual Displays <body> I have a 2007 Mac Pro that shipped with 10.4.7, and an ATI Radeon X1900 XT graphics card. The card has two DVI outputs for a dual display setup.  I recently updated my OSX to Snow Leopard and have never tried to connect a second monitor.  Now, when I try to connect a second monitor, OSX does not detect it. Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated.  <answer35548> Try putting your main screen in the slot that does not work. If you still get no video i think the port on the video card is dead.  What size screens are you using though?
