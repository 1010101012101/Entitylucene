Copy paste not working when using remote login by Microsoft remote desktop with SuperPutty <body> I use Microsoft Remote Desktop to connect to my office workstation running a Windows 8 Professional and predominantly work from using SuperPutty, an multi-tabbed terminal emulator which uses Putty in the backend.  I am having hard-time trying trying to copy paste between the terminal emulator and windows machine when remote connecting from my MacBook. Within the remote session, between other windows applications the Windows default Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V and Ctrl+X seem to work.  What setting am I missing here, I cannot change the terminal emulator as it is the most comfortable client when working directly on the Windows machine.  <comment311017> You are cut and pasting between two OS X pass so use OS X keys <comment311075> @Mark: Could you elaborate a bit more on this? I cannot seem to comprehend what you meant
