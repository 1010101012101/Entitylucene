"Service Battery" on rMBP <body> I have just received the dreaded "Service Battery" notice from my 2012 rMBP. My cycle count is 638. From the codeioreg/code utility I see a parameter code"DesignCycleCount9C" = 1000/code   strongMain question/strong: Is code"DesignCycleCount9C"/code the expected life-cycle count of the battery?   strongSide-question/strong: What are others getting in terms of cycle count before having to replace the battery? I realize that the lifetime is dependent on operating conditions. Just curious.
