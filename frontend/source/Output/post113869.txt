Is it possible to take a screenshot in vector format? <body> Is it possible to make screenshots in vector format (SVG or PDF) instead of only in raster formats on OS X?  <answer113872> strongNo/strong, since the screenshots are simply taken from the pixels shown on-screen or off-screen.  However, the screenshots can be turned into vectors using software such as Adobe Illustrator, but the result won't be exact.  <answer144596> strongSolution 1: Using a vector GUI widget API with PDF backend:/strong  Actually, it is possible. Consider the fact that on screen objects are created by a widget API, and if this widget API is based on vector elements and have appropriate vector output backend, then it can output to vector formats like PDF.  Please look at the similar question, which also contains some working samples:  ul liCan I take a screenshot as vector graphics or at a higher resolution than native?/li /ul  This needs Gtk+ widget library and Cairo as its GUI display and PDF generation backend, which both are available for Mac OS X. But as few applications in Mac OS X use Gtk+, this is not a general solution. I wanted to show the possibility of creating vector screenshots. If you are a developer, this may be useful for you.  hr  strongSolution 2: Creating vector mockups:/strong  For general applications, you can create mockups. Here you can find "Free Yosemite Vector GUI for Illustrator", which can be used to create mockups of your GUI. It includes all main UI Components:  http://codemotionapps.com/yosemite-gui/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zMTz.jpg" alt="Yosemite Vector GUI for Illustrator"  <comment247154> How could the linked answer (which seems to work for Linux only) be made to work on OS X? <comment247155> @patrix Both Gtk+ and Cairo are cross platform, and are available for Mac OS X. It is possible, so arguing that "screenshots are simply taken from the pixels", so vector screenshots are not possible is wrong. <comment247156> OS X applications typically do not use Gtk+ but the frameworks supplied with OS X. So any general solution *for OS X* (which is what this question is about) would need to catch the drawing commands within the basic Cocoa libraries. <comment247157> @patrix Yes, I agree that this is not a general solution, but I wanted to show the possibility of it. <comment247158> @patrix I have updated my answer to include the fact that is not a general solution, and I have also provided alternative ways to achieve reasonable vector mockups. <comment247160> @patrix Have you developed with Cocoa? As it is a resolution independent toolkit, and provides a PDF backend, it may be possible to provide general solutions. Exporting UIView and NSViews to PDF seems to be possbile, with some issues. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11948241/#comment50398792_11955836
