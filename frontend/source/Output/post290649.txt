What does "Sent as text message" mean in Messages on my iPhone? <body> If an outgoing text to another iPhone appears in green, with the comment: "Sent as text message", does that indicate that the sending number is not blocked on the remote phone? Other messages do not have any type of delivery comment, but, I'm curious about the ones as text.  <comment366892> There's dozens of questions and answers on this site that will help answer your questions about Messages and SMS.
