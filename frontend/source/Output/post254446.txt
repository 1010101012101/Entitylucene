How do I download .ipa files to iTunes/Mobile Applications during sync? <body> I just reinstalled iTunes for the first time in about a year (was having Config.Msi permissioning issues on install) and synced it with my computer. In my iTunes directory, I have a "Mobile Applications" folder with the .ipas of my older apps. How do I get my iTunes to download the rest of my iPad apps into this directory?  <answer254459> Connect your iPad to iTunes, then select File &rarr; Devices &rarr; Transfer Purchases.  <answer254959> Go to codeAccount/code → codePurchases/code → codeApps/code and in the bottom should be a button with a cloud symbol that says codeDownload All/code. It will start downloading all the apps silently, so don't spam the button.  If it finds an error, which happened to me with the "Find my Friends" app, click the X button in the top-left of the app and then click the codeDownload All/code button again.  I left the computer on all night and it finished downloading every one of the apps.  <comment317487> Didn't work for downloading the .ipas to the computer. I figured it out last night though.
