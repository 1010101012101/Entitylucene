If Android Studio is not running it does not wake up.  h2Steps to reproduce/h2  ol liConnect an Android device (I used a Nexus 7 2013)./li liRun Android Studio/li liClick the Apple icon in the status bar, and then click "Sleep"./li /ol  The computer wakes up automatically a few seconds later. The only walkaround is disconnecting the device or quitting Android Studio. Is there any better solution to this?  <comment274057> I've never used Android Studio but I suppose it sets up a network connection to your mac. Have you tried turning off _Wake for network access_ in the _Energy Saver_ settings from _System preferences_? <comment274155> I had disabled both waking from network and Bluetooth input devices. I guess the USB connection is the culprit. On Windows, there is something like "Allow this device to wake the computer", but OS X does not seem to have such feature.
