Why does my dock keep moving back to my other monitor? <body> I have a larger, external monitor connected to my MacBook Pro and have arranged it such that the dock is in the external monitor (via System Preferences  Displays  Arrangement, by dragging the white bar to the larger screen). This works fine, except for the fact that every now and then, the dock will suddenly shift back to my MacBook screen, but when I open up Displays to change this back, the white bar is still on the external monitor. So I have to drag it to the smaller screen, and then drag it back to the external monitor.   It's a minor issue, obviously, but I've noticed that it has been happening more and more frequently and it's getting quite annoying. Perhaps there's something I've been doing unintentionally for this to happen?   I'm using Mavericks, 10.9.5.   <answer169723> I answered a similar question here.  You can summon the Dock on a different display by dragging the cursor to the bottom of it's display, and then continuing the dragging down motion for a second or so.  Is it possible that this is occurring when you inadvertently perform that action?  <answer169749> I also found this 'emfeature/em' annoying as you expect the Dock to be on one screen then you accidentally move the mouse to the bottom of the second screen and the Dock moves across. The easiest way to get it back is to move the mouse to the bottom of the screen you want the dock on. Sometimes you have to move it up then back down to get it to move.  Personally I found two options that helped me with this:  ol liAt work I have my external monitor on a stand that sits behind my MacBook and arrange the screens so that the external monitor is just higher than my Macbook Screen then in the settings move the screen layout so they sit on top of each other. In this layout only one screen has a bottom as the external monitor is an extension to the Macbook Screen, thus stopping the Dock from moving. This layout also saves on desk space if you have a narrow desk./li liAt home I use a monitor side by side but set the dock to auto hide, then when I need to get to the Dock I just scroll down to the bottom of whatever screen my mouse is on to get the Dock. Because the Dock is always hidden and comes on when I want it I don't seem to find it annoying like I do when it is fixed at the bottom of one screen./li /ol  <answer194881> if you have problems dragging the mouse due to resolution differences between monitors. Go to System Preferences  Dock  "Position on screen:" click "Left" and the doc will move back to the main monitor. You can then click "Bottom" and the doc will move to the bottom.   <answer221798> (I wanted to add this comment to @Mr Rabbit's answer, but I can't as I don't have the requisite 50 points, so adding it here:)  The action that summons the dock to the opposite monitor is not very intuitive for me.  This is what worked for me.  ol liDon't hold the mouse button down.  (When people say "drag" the mouse, that usually implies with the mouse button held down.)/li liThe target area of the cursor needs to be at the bottom area of the monitor emwhich doesn't currently have the dock/em at a place emwhere the cursor can't move further down/em, i.e. this emdoesn't work/em on vertically stacked monitors along the area where the cursor can cross between screens./li liOnce the cursor is "blocked", pause a sec, then continue the motion downward.  The dock will be "summoned" to this monitor from the other monitor.  This works for vertically stacked monitors as long as there is some place where the cursor is "blocked".  If not, the cursor will just move to the other monitor since it is not "blocked".  If you have identical resolution monitors, this will probably not work per @Geraldus_US's comment below.  In that case you probably need to either left dock or right dock per @Geraldus_US.  Alternatively, unplug the auxiliary monitor and the dock will switch to the main monitor./li /ol  I don't see how anyone would find these motions to be intuitive.  How about a simple right-click option to "move Dock to this monitor"?   <answer224948> Obviously, Apple didn't account for over/under monitor configurations. In this case, the switching is constant and annoying.   I suppose that they assume you will put the dock on the side of the monitor, but I can't stand that config.  <answer232214> The Dock moves to that monitor where you had your cursor at the bottom (where the dock is usually positioned) and moved the cursor pointer further down, only to be blocked by the bottom wall.   Look at the diagram below (yellow block is your monitor):    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iZZJu.png" alt="Mouse movement at bottom of screen"  When cursor is blocked at bottom, moving the pointer further down brings the dock on that monitor. Can't use the words strongscrolling/strong or strongdragging/strong as you don't need to click/hold or use 2 fingers. It's just a normal mouse move.   So the strongcause/strong: Probably you are someone like me who likes to leave the cursor at the bottom of the screen on one monitor while watching movie or keyboard-only coding/development, and accidentally swipes/moves down when resuming to use the mouse/trackpad.   Happens with me all the time.   strongUpdate/strong: I just noticed that on the trackpad, it's not just a quick swipe.br You have to emswipe-down and hold/em on the track pad. It does nothing when you lift your finger quickly like a normal swipe gesture.  <comment199444> Wow. Yes. I just tried doing that and it shifted over. Of all the things... *grumble* Many thanks! At least now I know how to get it back on my main display more easily when I accidentally do that... <comment269326> Wow, kinda annoying functionality. Great answer. <comment270111> I want to mention, that if you have vertical alignment where active monitor is above secondary the case than you have to move dock to left or right side to make it appear on primary monitor, otherwise it will always appear on bottom monitor.  However, if your primary display is located below secondary dock appears at bottom automatically.  Looks like misfeature, or requires additional tweaks. <comment272147> "Dragging" confused me, so I'd say something more like "move the mouse *past* the bottom of the screen for a second or so and it'll jump to that screen." <comment273105> You really have to drag the mouse down a ton. I've had instances where it switched quickly, and others were it didn't. With this trick I get repeatable results. Thanks! <comment273309> I realized that under "arrangement" if my external display is touching the built-in then the doc won't move over.   http://imgur.com/T6MDNXW <comment279525> +1 for the choice of words. "Summon" fits perfectly here. <comment287687> This is very poor design and anyone with multiple displays will run into this.This functionality is anything but intuitive. As soon as you move your mouse onto a given display, the dock should appear there. What would be the reason for this not being the desired functionality? <comment287688> I can't stand it either, but this issue has annoyed me to the point of accepting one annoyance to escape the other. It's even more annoying because it seems the solution of having the dock always present on the screen the mouse pointer is on is a simple and logical design. <comment290896> I have tried all kinds of movements and the dock doesn't move to secondary display. what gives? <comment293209> This used to work, and today, .. it's not working.  :| <comment304214> It should be noted that this only works when a user gives each monitor its own Space <comment305061> It was a feature, not a bug? gosh I'm blown away! <comment321758> Another mind-bogglingly stupid Apple "feature."  Speaking of which, I'm typing this comment while my Apple Magic Mouse charges with the cable positioned directly underneath the bottom, making me unable to use it for a good hour or two. <comment337531> This works fine to me. <comment349116> works on El Capitan <comment371115> This is because the industry seems to be under the mistaken belief that it's perfectly acceptable to include completely invisible features, and just leave people guessing as to how to activate them. There should ALWAYS be some sort of visual indicator for every single feature, or you get this kind of confusion. I don't get modern UI design at all. They all do it.
