Change search Google in Safari to use Firefox <body> kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdL/kbd searches for the selected text in Google using Safari. Can I change this to use Firefox instead?  <answer2625> You can create a new service with automator, use the "Run Shell Script" action, and use:   codeopen -a FireFox "http://www.google.com/search?q=$1"/code  as the shell script text, then save it as "Open with Firefox" or whatever you like.  -or-  follow this summary from this thread:  ol liDownload and Install OnMyCommand/OMCEdit/li liOpen OMCEdit/li liClick on "Download Commands" then "Download"/li liGo in "Command Library"/li liChoose #22 and click on "Append to Command"/li liChange the name if you want (in "Command Name")/li liWrite " Top Level " in location if you don't want a sub-menu, or choose a name for the sub-menu ("In On My Command" is the default)/li liSave/li liYou're done! /li /ol  <answer2627> What you need to do is create a new Automator service. Unfortunately, Firefox's AppleScript support sucks, so you'll have to do it manually.  You should be able to use a combination of the tips in this article and this comment, and the page Calavera linked to should give you a general idea of how to format the URLs.  <comment2315> For the Automator method, I just had to ensure I had the input passed as arguments <comment2316> ya that screwed me up for a minute as well.. I was coming back to edit with that caveat ;P <comment2318> Actually, that only works if I select a single word, not a couple of words <comment2337> @Casebash my bad, move the end quotes to outside of the variable $1... updated post <comment2343> I wish there was a way to edit the default services, but I haven't been able to find anything other than statements about how they're "built into the operating system". <comment2365> @calavera - the way to get a new service isn't to change an existing service, but to add your own instead (as described in my answerâ€”no extra apps required). <comment2366> @Dori That's actually what I was describing in the first line of my post, creating an Automator action and saving as a service.  I did it when I wrote his answer but I guess I forgot to put the part about it being a service rather than a workflow.  In my comment I was actually just lamenting that you can't just edit the default "Search With Google" action rather than creating a new one.
