How to access environment variables in Javascript for Automation on OS X? <body> I am using JavaScript for Automation in an Alfred workflow. I want to access the various environment variables that Alfred sets up. How do I access the environment variable like alfred_version?  <answer236488> I do not have Alfred installed however I would think the following method should work.  For example, using the Script Editor set to JavaScript the following code returned my login name.  precodeObjC.import('stdlib') $.getenv('LOGNAME') /code/pre  So, I'd assume that if "codealfred_version/code" is the actual environment variable, then the following might work as well.  precodeObjC.import('stdlib') $.getenv('alfred_version') /code/pre  <comment290380> @RichardGuay, I'm glad it worked for you.  BTW In forums such as this one typically show appreciation by marking an answer, if applicable, as correct and or up voting the answer (and questions too). <comment290863> Sorry. I have used these to get knowledge, but I think this is only my second question on one, and the only one that had an answer. I think I checked it now. But, I do not have enough reputation to upvote.
