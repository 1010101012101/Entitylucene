Why is my Health App step count different to my Activity App step count? <body> Here you can see my Health App showing steps at 10:28pm:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/521mc.jpg" alt="enter image description here" You can see 19,062 steps.   Here you can see my Activity App showing steps at 10:28pm: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TaBiJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here" You can see 18,967 steps.   Now these seem to be out of sync, yet both are proprietary Apple products, and so don't have any API restrictions.   My question is: strongWhy is my Health App step count different to my Activity App step count?/strong   <answer258360> You only have a difference of 95 steps over a total of 19000 steps; it looks like a rounding error.  Or maybe the Apple Watch has not yet uploaded the latest steps to the iPhone (it does this every few minutes, in order to save battery).
