Spotlight taking a lot of power on macOS <body> I recently installed macOS, but I have noticed that "Spotlight.app" has had high CPU usage. It is not indexing.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGQg0.png" alt="macOS Activity Monitor"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEWiU.png" alt="Power menu bar item"  <answer254662> The emAverage Energy Impact/em column in Activity Monitor takes past energy usage into account. For example for me it shows 23,87 for Time Machine even though it is not backing up at the moment.  Apparently Spotlight has been very active but has now finished indexing.
