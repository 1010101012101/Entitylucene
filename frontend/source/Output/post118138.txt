Scrolling with a Monoprice tablet <body> Just received my new Monoprice tablet (this one) and it's working great. But there is one feature I'm missing: is there any way to scroll using only the pen and a button click (either on the keyboard, the tablet or even better - on the pen itself)?  Basically I want to be able to press a button to enable scrolling; that scrolling is then done using only the mouse cursor position. It would probably be something like the autoscroll feature you sometimes get when clicking the middle scroll wheel on some computer mouses (at least on a PC). That behavior is discussed by the oh-so-relevant Jeff Atwood here. ;)  I'm on Mavericks and need the solution to work system-wide but primarily with Chrome.  <comment137881> Burnso - you might edit in what OS you are running and which apps you need to scroll in.
