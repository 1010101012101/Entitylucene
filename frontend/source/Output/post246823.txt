Terminal not running programs when pressing enter <body> Command line isn't properly running programs  After trying to run a program on terminal it doesn't execute properly and just makes a new line with  at the start  How can I fix this  <answer246824> It sounds like you have a single " or ' somewhere in your command line arguments. Maybe something like this:   pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeecho It's a nice day /code/pre  The command line is waiting for the matching " or '. That's what the  means.  You can fix this by quoting the entire argument with the other kind of quote:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeecho "It's a nice day" /code/pre  Or escaping the offending character with \  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeecho It\'s a nice day /code/pre  <comment304503> Press Control-C to return to the prompt, then look at  Edward Falk's answer. <comment304504> It's helpful if you provide the command you are trying to execute.
