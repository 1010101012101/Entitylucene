Why is Mountain Lion saying it can't do time machine backups to my time capsule hard drive? <body> I've got a MacBook Air that has been successfully backing up via Time Machine to my Time Capsule hardrive. Since I updated to Mountain Lion I'm getting the following error:  precodethe backup disk is not in mac os extended (journaled) format which is required /code/pre  When I google around it looks like this is a common error for non-apple hard drives (b/c they're formatted in FAT, or something else non-compatible), but I'm not finding anybody else having this problem with a Time Capsule drive.  Other than the backups not working, the drive (and router) seem to be functioning perfectly.  Thanks!
