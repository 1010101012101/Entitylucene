Triple finger tap for middle click? <body> I can single tap my trackpad for a left click, and tap it with two fingers for a right click. Is there any way to bind a three finger tap to perform a middle click?  I tried MagicPrefs, but it's limited to the MagicMouse only, it doesn't work with the trackpad.  <answer7117> You can try strongBetterTouchTool/strong. There might be a setting to do that. Maybe you'll even find another gesture to triple-click that you'll like better.  <answer13952> There is also another tool that I like more then BetterTouchTool, it's called MiddleClick and does exactly what you expect :-)  <comment7592> Brilliant, it seems to work perfectly, thanks. <comment151252> This is exactly what I was looking for to get middle-click paste working on a virtual machine. Thanks!
