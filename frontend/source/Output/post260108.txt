problems to start my Macbook <body> I have downgraded my macbook from MAVERICK to Snowleopard. After installing the version 10.6.1 I upgraded to the next version suggested by the system which was 10.6.8. However, after the upgraded the system did not restart automatically so I forced to quit. I restarted the computer but after inserting the password in the initial screen and accepted it,it comes back to the same screen. Every time I restart the computer, insert the password the system comes back systematically at the same screen without initialing the system. Could you please let me know what to do? thank V.  <comment325535> What is the exact model of MacBook that you are using? <comment325537> Sounds like a recovery mode is required via command+r or command+option/alt+r for interneet recovery.
