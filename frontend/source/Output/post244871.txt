How to choose an option in some windows with keyboard? <body> For example, when I close an app with some changes without saving ir before. A window asks me if I want to save or not.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdPC2.png" alt="enter image description here"  In Windows I can choose between these options with kbdTab/kbd but in Mac does not work.  EDIT: To save the document It's obviously that I can press kbdEnter/kbd but I want to know how can I choose the other options.  PS: sorry for my english, I'm from Argentina  EDIT2: I found the answer here but I don't know how to mark as 'Answered': How to set it up to switch between tabs using TAB key on Macbook?
