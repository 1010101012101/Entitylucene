Strange behavior of max/minimize button <body> As described in the title of this question. It seems a very strange behavior.  When I press a minimize button of a maximized window, the window shrinks to the bottom part of the screen like a screenshot. I've never moved the window to that location, so it's very weird.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5V0G1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment117150> Have you ever used an external monitor with a much larger resolution than the display this screenshot was taken on? <comment117151> No, I haven't. It's new MBA. I used it less than a month. No external DP used. :( <comment117153> Every window, or just Safari? <comment117154> It seems only Safari has the problem. <comment117155> It's probably a plist issue.  But I am not at a mac to get accurate filenames and locations.  So if anyone is, and wants to find the Safari .plist filename and location, and suggest trashing it, that might work.  a  .plist is the preference list file for a program, holding various bits of info and meta info such as window locations etc.  They are either read on program start, or created from scratch using defaults if one doesn't exist already.  Deleting a plist is a good way to set an app back to default for many things. <comment117224> `~/Library/com.apple.Safari.plist`
