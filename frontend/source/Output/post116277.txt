Difference between 'Home sharing' and 'Network sharing' <body> When I like to share my iTunes library, I have to options to do so.  ol liHome sharing via my Apple ID/li liNetwork sharing./li /ol  What is the difference between these to? Are there any advantages or disadvantages or missing features comparing these two methods?  <answer116281> While both options offer the possibility of emstreaming/em the content of up to five iTunes libraries through a emhome network/em, it's only through strongHome Sharing/strong when you are able to actually strongimport/strong the content into your own iTunes Library.   Even more, when you use a computer on your emHome Sharing network/em to download an item from the iTunes Store, you can have the item download automatically to other computers on your emHome Sharing network/em.  Other big difference is that strongHome Sharing/strong lets you strongstream/strong content from your iTunes library into your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV (2nd and 3rd generation), whilst strongNetwork sharing/strong don't.  <comment136011> On which iTunes version ? <comment136015> @MatthieuRiegler 11.1.3 <comment137127> Does that mean that I cannot stream content from my library to my iDevice using Network sharing? So I could remote my library but not stream the content to the iDevice? <comment137133> @DaPhil Yes, only through **Home Sharing** you are able to **stream** content to the iDevices / Apple TV. <comment137134> @DaPhil Content import can only be done with **Home Sharing** and between **Computers**.
