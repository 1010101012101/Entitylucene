Cannot switch FaceTime call to iPhone after initiating it on my Mac <body> I initiated a call on my MacbookPro (running OS X Yosemite), but I cannot transfer it to my iPhone while it's in progress, as advertised on the Continuity feature.  The Apple Support article says:     Transfer the call to your iPhone: Unlock your iPhone, then tap the “Touch to return to call” banner at the top of the screen on your iPhone.   When I unlock my iPhone 6 Plus (running iOS 8.1), however, no banner appears at the top of the screen, and my phone seems to completely ignore the presence of a call.  Since there are no troubleshooting steps listed on the Apple Support guide for this issue, is there any way to troubleshoot this issue or to fix it?  <answer154423> Try to open Phone app on your iPhone, you must see the banner and will be able to return to call.  <answer211860> from the lock screen, the phone icon should be at the lower left, swipe up and it will take over the call from the mac.  <comment210884> Maybe this will help: http://www.cultofmac.com/297221/continuity-handoff-ios-8-os-x-yosemite/ It mentions the respective settings you have to have set up on both of your devices.
