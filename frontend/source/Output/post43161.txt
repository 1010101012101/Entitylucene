Cannot upgrade to iOS5.1 <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can not upgrade to iOS 5.1       I read that iOS 5.1 was finally released yesterday, and since then, am trying to upgrade my ipod touch 4th generation, but since then, after so many attempts, I get the message  precodeUnable to Check for Update An error occurred while checking for a software update. /code/pre  I saw on the website that other people are having the same problem, and did the following  ul liChanged the network DNS to 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4/li liRebooted the device/li /ul  But it is not working. How can I upgrade it?  <comment49040> Have you tried signing in and out of your Apple ID? I had to do that to get apps to download, and I did it just before trying the 8.8.8.8 trick, so it might have helped for me too. <comment49042> Are you using the Settings app, or iTunes? <comment49045> @BenBrocka I just tried it, but could not get to do it. Is the DNS 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 or just  8.8.8.8 ? <comment49046> @TimothyMueller-Harder I am not connecting it to any computer, and am not using iTunes. I am doing it through Settings app. <comment49047> In that case I would suggest using iTunes to update it. <comment49072> @TimothyMueller-Harder I don't have a computer to which iTunes can be installed, and I don't want to use iTunes.
