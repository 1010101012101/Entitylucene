Paste into Xterm on MacBook Air <body> I'm running Xterm in a Linux VMware Virtual Machine. I can copy out of it but I can't figure out how to paste into it. On a desktop computer, the middle mouse button or shift + insert does the trick. How about on a MacBook Air?  <answer55159> If you're using an external mouse, clicking both buttons (if it's a two button mouse) should do it.   I'm not aware of a way to do it with the trackpad only unless you use a third party tool like KeyRemap4Macbook which will let you bind, eg, kbd‚å•/kbd + left click to a middle click. I've just tested exactly that combination and it works fine for pasting into an X11.app Xterm so should work fine with your VM.  <answer55167> Most terminals on Linux allow you to paste with kbdControl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdV/kbd.   (The shift is to make this match kbdControl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdC/kbd for Copy, because you can't use kbdControl/kbd+kbdC/kbd in a terminal because that's already mapped to kill the running process [^C].)
