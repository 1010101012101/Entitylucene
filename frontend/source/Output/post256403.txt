Unable to unlock the "Click the lock to make changes" in Security & Privacy after installing macOS Sierra <body> After installing macOS Sierra on my 2015 MacBook, I found that I was unable to unlock the "Click the lock to make changes" in System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy.  I contacted Apple and all they offered was to erase the Macintosh HD and reinstall macOS Sierra.  Is there anything else I can try, other than doing the extreme solution offered by Apple?  <comment319756> Welcome to Ask Different.

Do you get the password dialog box that says, "System Preferences" is trying to unlock Security & Privacy preferences. Type your password to allow this."? Do you type in your password and then what happens? Have you tried reseting your password? If not have a look at: [macOS Sierra: Reset a login password](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25720). <comment319991> When I click the lock "Click the lock to make changes" in Security & Privacy under System Preferences I just see "Authentificating" for part of a second and thats it.
