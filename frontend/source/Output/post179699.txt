What does the orange keys mean in keyboard viewer? <body> I use the keyboard viewer as a cheat sheet so I can guide myself in the horrible fields of OSX keymaps and I realised that pressing some keys will display a few keys in orange. What does that color indicate?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UPHHk.png" alt="Orange keys in OS X keyboard viewer"  <answer179703> Those keys in orange are so-called dead keys. It's a key that does not necessarily generate a complete character by itself but may modify the character generated by the key struck immediately after.  The usage of those dead keys in a text editor or in the Terminal is usually indicated by a yellowish background. You may then enter the main character you want to modify to finally get the desired one.  Not all combinations of a dead key and a normal key are used. Typing kbdalt/kbdkbdn/kbd (=kbd~/kbd) kbdn/kbd will result in a 'ñ'. But kbdalt/kbdkbdn/kbd (=kbd~/kbd) kbdt/kbd just gives '~t'.  <answer179704> It means that those symbols overlay themselves onto whatever letter you next. For example, kbdOption/kbdkbdu/kbd followed by kbdu/kbd would type ü, rather than ¨u.  <answer179705> The orange represent accent characters to add to the next inputed letter. It is functionally equivalent to accessing OSX’s accent menu - holding down a key and seeing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdTQR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  For example. So, alternatively, you can type kbdoption/kbdkbdu/kbd followed bykbdu/kbd to add a diaresis to the letter kbdü/kbd  <comment213183> You are right. After you press the dead key the keyboard viewer also shows the modified keys. E.g. pressing `¨` will display `ö` instead of `o` in it. Textfields also highlight the entered dead key in orange.
