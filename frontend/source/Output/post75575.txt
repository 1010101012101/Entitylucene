How much power does a mac mini uses? <body> I would like to know how much power would a mac Mini consume per month/year if:  ul lialways powered,  but under very low load web server/li liOS, probably Ubuntu/li litwo drives: one SSD and one HD./li limodel Early 2010, Core duo 2/li /ul  I know that the manufacturer specification says it would consume between 11W-85W.  How can I convert this to Amps?  <answer75580> If the idle power consumption was 11 W and the maximum was 85 W, the average might be something like 15 W if it's under very low load.  That would be about 500 MJ per year (15*86400*365).  If you paid 0.15 USD per kilowatt hour for electricity and the Mac mini was on all the time, it would cost about 20 USD per year (0.15*0.015*24*365).  15 W is about 65 mA with 230 V (European) voltage and 125 mA with 120 V (North American) voltage.  <comment87743> That largely depends on how much power you need to draw for whatever you are running on it... <comment87757> Thanks! BTW, how does this relates to the pricing asked for electricity by the hosting providers. I've seen that they specify things like: 2A and pay x$ for every additional 0.5A.
