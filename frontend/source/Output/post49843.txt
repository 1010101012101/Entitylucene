What open source video editing software packages are available for the Mac? <body> What are open source video editing softwares available for the Mac? I have used Pitivi, AVS on other systems.   <answer49883> I found two:  h1Jahshaka/h1  It is an open source free, video editing software, effects, and compositing suite.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZh1S.jpg" alt=""br When I used it several months back, it was very unintuitive and I couldn't figure out how to use it. However, there are tutorials for Jahshaka now.  h1Kdenlive/h1  Kdenlive is an open source, multi track video editor released under the GNU Public Licence.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AeBav.png" alt=""br (The screenshot is of Kdenlive running on Windows, but it is available for the Mac through Macports)  <comment57094> Does it have to be open source? How about "free as in beer" and "not free, but cheap"? <comment57097> "free as in beer" will do? :D
