Options to play alarm sound/notification via network signal? <body> Is there an existing application or a cheap solution to instruct an iPhone to play an alarm - sound and/or notification via a network signal/api?   I'd like to connect a user's iPhone to an emergency/alarm system but without creating an entire application for that. It's important that this alarm sound is loud as possible (user evt. sleeps), until the user dismisses it.  With jailbroken iPhones this isn't a problem, we currently connect the iPhone via SSH to the system, and then play an ring-tone via shell. But of course, we'd like to find a solution for non-jailbroken devices.  thanks
