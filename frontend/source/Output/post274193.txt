Triggering Sparkle updates in all apps? <body> I've been annoyed and concerned with Macupdate's recent inclusion of adware in some of their update packages.  I realize that a lot of apps that aren't from the Mac App Store include the Sparkle updater functionality, but it requires launching the app to trigger the update check.  Is there a way to scan for all apps with the Sparkle updater and trigger the update check one by one?  Edit: I just discovered this post at SE. Perhaps it's too convoluted a process.
