OS X PDF tool where annotations behave like Acrobat Pro? <body> I'm looking for a PDF viewer where annotation functionality is similar to Acrobat Pro, e.g.:  ul liWhen text is selected, typing creates a red strikethrough and adds a comment with the suggested new text (and pressing the delete key also strikes through the text)/li liIt's possible to add a comment/note directly to a highlight on text (so it's clear exactly which text the comment/note refers to)/li liIt's possible to annotate emany/em document, not just one where Reader commenting is enabled (so Reader X is out)/li /ul  I've read that Skim's annotations aren't viewable in many other tools/platforms. PDFpen and Preview don't do annotations in the way I described. And Acrobat Pro itself is just too expensive. Any suggestions for alternative tools? (I've searched through related questions/answers here but none addressed this exact requirement.)
