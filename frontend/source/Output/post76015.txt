How do I set a static IP for my iPad? <body> I have an iPad v1 and need to plug in its IP to a program on my computer to test files.  The problem is every time I connect, the IP is reset and I have to enter a new IP.  Is there a way to have it permanently on one IP?  <answer76017> Settings -- WiFi -- select the network -- select Static and set the necessary values  <answer76020> In your router you should be able to statically assign an IP address for the iPad based on its MAC address.
