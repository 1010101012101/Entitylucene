Can't get past the system lock PIN code <body> I locked my MacBook using Find My iPhone and now when attempting to start using it again, I cannot type my PIN into the unlock section. Nothing happens. I can't even click on sleep, restart, shut down or the internet options.  I tried kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdR/kbd and kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdR/kbd-kbdP/kbd. Both just came up with a different password screen which I put the PIN into and then they went back to the PIN screen. I have no idea what else I can do.  <answer221654> It sounds like your system has the firmware password set.  You will need to enter the firmware password first, before you can get back into your system and enter the recovery pin.  <answer276446> There are multiple options available.    ul liYou can purchase a EFI Rom chip for your particular model computer, attach it to the logic board and it will bypass the system EFI.  http://www.cmizapper.com/components/chips.html/li liYou can attempt to rewrite the existing EFI chip  https://ghostlyhaks.com/blog/blog/hacking/18-apple-efi-bypass/li liYou can attempt to brute force the password with an Arduino Teensy https://github.com/orvtech/efi-bruteforce or similar. http://www.cmizapper.com/products/brutus.html/li /ul
