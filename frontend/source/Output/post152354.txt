Screensharing slow, even over gigabit ethernet <body> When I connect from my laptop to my server with Apple Screen Sharing, it is extremely laggy, even over gigabit ethernet.  Files copy at expected speeds (~100MB/s) but Screen Sharing is terribly slow.  Any way to speed this up?  SUCCESS! I used 3 staples in a VGA/DVI adapter. (1 was not enough.)  Thanks, @j-beda!  Now it's as fast as actually being on the machine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7pEq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer152436> Suggest that you try alternate screen sharing systems.  Chicken of the VNC is one option.  TeamViewer is another option.  (http://teamviewer.com)   I have had reasonable response using teamviewer over a satellite link to a remote machine running windows on the other side of the continent.  Not instantaneous.  But given that every round trip packet involved 160,000 km of microwave...  <answer152521> Some (all?) Macs when run without a monitor turn off the video circuitry so they do not waste energy, even though this circuitry is used by screen sharing to dramatically speed up screen stuff.  There might be a way to turn this circuitry back on through software, but I have not foud a reliable way to do so. What works very well is to plug in something into a video port to get the Mac to think it has a monitor connected.  You can build one yourself: http://blog.macminicolo.net/post/33839671756/build-a-dummy-dongle-for-a-headless-mac-mini  Buy one to plug into a HDMI port on some MacMinis: http://blog.macminicolo.net/post/72706369716/an-hdmi-adapter-for-a-headless-mac-mini  Buy one to plug into the MiniDisplay Port: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/NewerTech/CBLMDPHEAD/  Instructions for a resistor added directly to the video card:  http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=11  I picked up a handful of the HDMI ones a while back, they are very useful.  A similar question/answer is at Force the resolution on a headless mac mini server   <comment179271> I'm not sure if this is normal, but I think screen sharing is always slow, no matter the ethernet speed. Either that, or I have the same problem. +1 to attract attention. <comment179395> @Ze'ev If you're using the Windows RDP experience as a baseline, they're just not comparable. <comment179500> Aha! That makes sense. But there must be a way to trick the system into thinking it's got a monitor via software? The server is a Hackintosh, BTW. <comment179501> Already tried both of those; no better. <comment179520> I wish. I tried various things, including http://www.airsquirrels.com/airparrot/ which some have claimed does the trick when it adds its virtual monitor driver stuff, but I was unable to see any real improvements, certainly none as large as those that happened when I plugged in a dongle. Try screen sharing with a Mac that has a monitor attached and you'll see the difference - smooth as silk as they say. <comment179523> If your server has a DVI output, you might be able to get by with just plugging in a single resistor in the approriate holes in the video card. I have seen reference to people using a paper-clip. http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=11 <comment179524> I was thinking of trying just a piece of wire... But might that damage my video card? <comment179526> It looks like it wants around 75 ohms, but people report it working with a variety of resistances. The zorinaq link has someone who claims it is pretty safe even with a paperclip, but getting a resistor and taping the leads so they don't short would probably be safest. <comment179533> SUCCESS!! I used 3 staples. See above.
