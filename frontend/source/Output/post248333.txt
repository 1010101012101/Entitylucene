How to change FAT32 file attributes under OS X? <body> FAT and FAT32 file systems support file attributes like "read only". How can I change those under OS X? The standard chmod command does not seem to do the trick. How else can I do this?  <answer248335> FAT/FAT32 formatted volumes do not support permissions and all files will show as code-rwxrwxrwx/code and directories will show as codedrwxrwxrwx/code under OS X in Terminal.  <answer248336> I found a way to do it via the codemtools/code package. I installed it via home-brew (codebrew install mtools/code).  Then I took a look which device I wanted to manipulate: codediskutil list/code. In my case this was code/dev/disk3s1/code. So I unmounted the disk: codedisuktil unmount /dev/disk3s1/code.  Then I followed the instructions from this blog:  ol liCreate a code~/.mtoolsrc/code with this content: codedrive s: file="/dev/disk3s1" mtools_skip_check=1/code/li liUse codemdir/code and codemattrib/code to navigate around and change file attributes/li liUnmount the whole disk: codedisuktil unmountDisk /dev/disk3/code/li /ol  I would have to use the tools with sudo, though: codesudo mdir s:/code, codesudo mattrib +r s:/some/path/code.  <answer248344> Under OS X, the FAT/FAT32 file system Readonly attribute is set when a file is locked. When a file is viewed in the Finder application, a small lock will appear on the file icon. This Readonly attribute can be set or unset by highlighting the file and then selecting "File-Get Info" from the menu bar. The Readonly attribute can then be modified by checking or unchecking the box labeled "Locked".   This also can be done from the command line. First, to view the attributes use the command below.  precodels -lO &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  To set the Readonly attribute use the following command.  precodechflags uchg &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  To reset the Readonly attribute use the following command.  precodechflags nochg &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  To set the Hidden attribute use the following command.  precodechflags hidden &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  To reset the Hidden attribute use the following command.  precodechflags nohidden &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  To set the Archive attribute use the following command. emNote: this command is the opposite of what one would expect to enter./em"  precodesudo chflags noarch &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  To reset the Archive attribute use the following command. emNote: this command is the opposite of what one would expect to enter./em"  precodesudo chflags arch &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre     Note: The System attribute does not seem to have an OS X equivalent. So even if the Windows command codeattib/code can alter the System attribute, the OS X command codechflags/code can not.   <comment307642> What exactly have you tried (which specific `chmod` command)? <comment307651> But the question was about attributes which are called flags under OS X.
