Need help to understand how this find command works <body> I'm a beginner on OS X and I believe this command will make a list of all files and subfolders of specific folders   precodefind /Volumes/Documents/ -exec stat -f "%N %Sm" {} + &gt;~/Desktop/test.txt /code/pre  I don't know how to figure out what this actually does.  <answer125749> The command you posted has two parts  ul licodefind /Volumes/Documents/ -exec stat -f "%N %Sm" {} +/code/li licode&gt;~/Desktop/test.txt/code/li /ul  The second part is easier to explain, it just writes all the output of the first one into a file called codetest.txt/code which is stored on your desktop. If you leave that part out, the result of codefind/code will be directly written into your Terminal window.  The first part is the actual codefind/code command. A call to codefind/code basically gets two kinds of parameters  ul lione or several paths acting as starting point for the search (code/Volumes/Documents//code in your case)/li lione or several expressions aka "find commands" which get applied to every file/folder found/li /ul  A simple version would look like codefind /Volumes/Documents/ -print/code which just prints every file/folder found.  In your example the expression part is a bit more elaborated:  ul licode-exec/code runs a command on the results of find (codestat -f "%N %Sm"/code actually)/li licodestat/code gives info about a file./li liThe code-f/code option for stat displays information using a specified format./li licode%N %Sm/code is the format used by code-f/code.  ul licode%/code means a format string./li licodeN/code means to print the file name./li licodeSm/code means to print the date modified for the file./li /ul/li licode{} +/code is replaced by as many found files/as possible in each call to codestat/code/li /ul  For more information on understanding commands, see the man page for codefind/code and codestat/code.  <comment147127> find and stat are in man - what is the issue <comment147160> I'm pretty much beginner for the command line of OSX. So, I would like to know why It's composed like this. <comment147336> Thank you very much for your detail information. I would appreciated it. Sorry I have no enough reputation to up vote yet.
