Will the Lightning to USB 3 adapter let me connect via Xcode for debugging via the power passthrough? <body> I see that the Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter has two 'inputs', the usb port and an additional Lightning port. From anecdotal evidence (I have found no official manual) it is for power supply. Nice, but. Can I use this port to connect to computer, for Xcode debugging purposes, while using the Camera Adapter for connecting a MIDI device at the same time?   Thanks.
