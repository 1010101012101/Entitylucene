Is this magnetic connector for iPhone approved by Apple? <body> One of the problems with iPhone/iPad cables is that they get bent and damaged. There is a smart idea floating around about a magnetic cable similar to the MacBook one. The lightning connected is attached to the iPhone and the cable gets connected to it because it magnetic  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/69kWR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Kickstarter and indiegogo have more than one project promoting this concept.  I would love to purchase one of these cables but from a previous experience I can say that any lightning that isn't approved by Apple will cause endless problems.  One of the projects' developer claim that his lightning is approved by Apple, below is a quote from the FAQs which I failed to understand     Why have you not chosen to use the original lightning connector or   have MFi certification?      Apple has not released a magnetic lightning connector, hence it is not   possible to apply for MFi certification and by producing a lightning   connector that is not MFi certified, it leaves that company open to   legal action by Apple. Any company claiming to have MFi magnetic   connectors would not be truthful as of April 2016.   strongIs he saying that his cable is approved by Apple or not? What about other products?/strong  <answer237095> They're saying Apple hasn't approved any "magnetic lightning connectors" so they and their competitors are selling non-certified connectors.  Apple's patent 7,311,526 covers their Magsafe technology, which these lightning connectors could easily infringe upon.  I wouldn't go near any of these while they're in a Kickstarter/Indiegogo phase.  <comment290268> They're saying Apple hasn't approved any "magnetic lightning connectors" so they and their competitors are selling non-certified connectors. <comment290269> @Dan so they themselves are not offering a genuine Apple approved connector? <comment290271> No, it doesn't look like they are. Apple also holds patents for their Magsafe technology, which these could easily infringe upon. I wouldn't go near any of these while they're in a Kickstarter/Indiegogo phase. <comment290272> @Dan would you like to put your comments as an answer? <comment290297> I know this is kind of overly critical, but it's "Lightning" not "lightening".
