Using (Shared) Reminders on iPhone - Any Way to Recover? <body> So, my wife created a Reminders list on her phone and added me.  When I accepted the share and went into it, it wasn't loading the list items, so I deleted the list and she removed the share and readded me.  But now I can't get the list.  If I log into iCloud it says that I've already accepted the share.  Any thoughts?  <comment238726> Your wife needs to recover it from her last backup - then let it share in its own sweet time ;) <comment238727> I don't think there is a backup.  But it works fine on her phone. <comment238729> Ah, sorry - wasn't reading properly. Maybe if she renames it, or something to make iCloud think it's something different.
