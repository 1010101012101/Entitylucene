How to delete orphan images from Notes.app on Mac <body> I have an image that shows in the “Browse attachments” view in the Notes app on Mac, but when I right-click on it and choose emShow in Note/em, it doesn’t return any note, as it was deleted previously.  Is there a way to remove this orphan image? And if yes, how?  <answer294093> I solved this by going to emShow in Note/em from iPhone — it showed an empty note and when I got back to the attachments view, the orphan one was gone. And it synced to the Mac as well.
