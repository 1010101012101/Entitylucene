Restore iPod Touch without passcode or power button <body> How could I reset my 4th gen iPod Touch just using my computer and a cable? My power button doesn't work and I have the white screen of death. The only way to reset the device I've seen is to hold the power and home button and then use restore on iTunes, but I can't do that for obvious reasons.  Are there any fixes for this?  <answer100643> You might be able to use RecBoot.
