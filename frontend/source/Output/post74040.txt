How do I "Get Info" from the command line? <body> Related to this question: https://superuser.com/q/514528/90435  Via http://osxdaily.com/2010/10/12/find-out-where-a-file-was-downloaded-from/ I find out that you can use 'get info' though Finder to find out where a file was downloaded from.    For example -br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2bes.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now - my question is - can I get the same information from the command line?   <answer74045> codemdls/code lists the metadata attributes of a given file. Try this:     codemdls -name kMDItemWhereFroms/code emfilename/em   <answer74051> According to this article about command line tricks you can do the following:  precodesqlite3 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV* 'select LSQuarantineDataURLString from LSQuarantineEvent' | grep YOURFILENAME /code/pre  Just exchange YOURFILENAME with the file you want to check.  <comment86032> why the down vote? A comment about it would be nice <comment86283> I don't think your answer fully applies to the question. That's probably the reason you got the downvote. <comment86298> @patrix the question is: can you get the same information from the command line. And you can get these informations with the above stated command. It may not be the best solution to the question but it is for sure an alternitve to lhf s answer. <comment86331> Only if the information is still (or was at all) in the database. <comment86333> @patrix and the file exists ..... the computer is turned on ..
