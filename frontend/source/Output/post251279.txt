CPU temperature using sysctl <body> I'm trying to get CPU temperature from the terminal using codesysctl/code.  strongCommand/strong:  precodesysctl machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level /code/pre  strongOutput/strong:  precodemachdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level: 0 /code/pre  But the given temperature is not correct(Original temperature is: 51c).  How does the temperature is calculated by codesysctl/code? Sometimes the temperature is code0/code.  Why the temperature is wrong?  Thank you.
