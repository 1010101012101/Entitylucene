Snow Leopard Preview Update <body> Snow Leopard Preview does not show some PDF (Version 1.7) although these can be viewed in Lion.  Is there an upgrade? After all Version 1.7 is a 2006 ISO Standard  <comment56020> I am afraid the upgrade is called "Lion". I am in a similar situation, wanting some upgrades contained in Lion (but not really new features) for Snow Leopard. Apple doesn't do that usually. All we'll get from now on are security updates and updates necessary to support iTunes/iDevices.
