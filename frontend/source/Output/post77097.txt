safari copy only plain link <body> I'm copying a link from Safari, via "Copy Image Link". When I'm pasting it to some places, like Messages.app, or some input fields on the Web (not every one, but many of them), I just get a file-name:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXP4P.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C6Ept.png" alt="enter image description here"  (The latter sends a clickable filename on Computers, however it's just plain filename, not clickable, on iPhones :-( )  Can I just disable this nurturing behaviour and get raw, plain links? They are fine for me.  <answer77098> From the screenshot, I noticed that you are pasting it into Messages.app. What I'll usually do to work around this annoyance is to paste using codeOption+Shift+Command+V/code. This works for most apps that takes more than just plain text input.   <comment89456> oh, that works! maybe I should swap these shortcuts around
