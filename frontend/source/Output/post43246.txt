How can I use an Apple remote control with customized actions without having the button actions happen? <body> I want to use a white plastic Apple remote with BetterTouchTool to control Safari, but while it works, the default button actions (e.g. skip, volume up) still happen. How can I prevent this?  <answer45261> subI've been looking for a solution to this for a long time everywhere. That is discussions.apple.com, various popular technology websites and mac forums. The emonly/em real solution that I've seen is a piece of software by strongTwisted Melon/strong./sub  h2Mira: Remote Control any Mac/h2  This applications rests in the system preferences and strongcustomizes the apple remote buttons on a per-app basis/strong. You can download and try the software from their website.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hJXSU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer45779> strongRemote Buddy/strong will allow you do to this (plus a whole lot more if you wish). You can customise a range of actions for each application and assign these to the Apple remote buttons (this includes both press and press-and-hold). You can also define your own custom actions if the built-in ones don't suit. Nothing came close for me in terms of flexibility and ease of use - I tried both Mira and Sofa Control before settling on RB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ylmbx.png" alt="enter image description here"  Personally, I use this to control my XBMC media centre with a range of custom button-presses and use the launch menu to start it up. It works with the white plastic remote too, I've just got the aluminium one thats shown in the screenshot.  <comment51545> Any yes, it works in lion. <comment52170> Isn't the software called Mira? I think its the hardware remote receiver thats the Manta bit. <comment52171> @binarybob Thanks. I guess his was Autocorrect? Really strange typo... :) <comment52174> The Mira page *is* a bit confusing, though. Near the top it does actually say "Manta: Remote control any Mac" and follows that with the Mira screenshot :-/ <comment52176> @binarybob Yeah. Manta is just the USB receiver. <comment52192> To clarify: this overrides the button actions, rather than adding them? <comment52242> @TimothyMueller-Harder Thats right, it replaces the default actions with the new ones you assign for the particular application. But don't just take my word for it, I would download the trial version from the website and see if it does what you need. <comment52251> There's also an "express" version [on the MAS](http://itunes.apple.com/app/remote-buddy-express/id438093690?mt=12&affId=2008573&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) which is a bit cheaper, if you don't need [remote support other than the Apple remote](http://www.iospirit.com/products/remotebuddy/compare/)
