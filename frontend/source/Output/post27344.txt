What is the location of background image set from Safari? <body> Safari allows you to set any image as desktop background right from the browser.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDVSH.png" alt="Use Image as Desktop Picture in Safari"  strongDesktop &amp; Screen Saver/strong preference pane will then display it as emSafari Desktop Picture/em.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BVCq.png" alt="Safari Desktop Picture"  No filename, no location, and if I change it, seems like the picture is lost.br I find it frustrating because, although I frequently change wallpapers, I'd like to keep each of them.br I could as well download the file manually but isn't this what strongUse As Desktop Picture/strong exists for?  So, the question is:       strongWhere is this image actually stored on my hard drive?/strongbr   How do I retrieve it?   <answer27345> Open strong~/Library/Safari//strong.br It is there, called strongSafari Desktop Picture.jpg/strong (or whatever the extension is).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mM58F.png" alt="Safari Desktop Picture location"  If you're on Lion, to get to strongLibrary/strong folder you may open strongFinder/strong, select strongGo/strong from the top menu and  hold kbd⌥ Option/kbd. The normally hidden strongLibrary/strong menu will reveal itself in the folder list. Open it, and proceed to strongSafari/strong subfolder.  If you're not on Lion or just prefer the quick way, open strongFinder/strong, press kbd⇧ Shift/kbd + kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd + kbdG/kbd to open directory prompt and paste strong~/Library/Safari//strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gnFtB.png" alt="Safari Desktop Picture location"  <comment31414> Using the Go To Folder keyboard shortcut on Lion will still work if you type out ~/Library - I think it will tab-complete as expected.  No need to specifically use the Go menu plus option key modifier as per above. <comment31419> I think it is slightly more fun, that's why I included it. <comment31420> @da4: Thanks for the comment though. I made an edit.
