Renewing iOS Developer Program with Lebanese credit card <body> Since I emailed apple three times now and shockingly got no response at all, I am laying out my problem here.  I am trying to renew my developer program using a lebanese credit card that has a lebanese billing address. However Apple is obliging me to pay through the US store using a US credit card (US billing address!)  What am I supposed to do??  <answer121964> I had a case where i needed to add a credit card to the Hong Kong App Store, but i only had a Thai credit card. I called them and they said that i should just use the Thai credit card and the Thai address, even though the country was fixed to Hong Kong. I tried it and it worked. Have you tried this?
