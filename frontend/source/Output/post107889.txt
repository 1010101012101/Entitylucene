Cannot Find Browsing history in IOS7 <body> On previous versions of iOS, I knew how to get a list of sites previously visited.   I need to get URL of site i browsed about 3 weeks ago.  Anybody know if this is missing form IOS7 or if it is hidden in the user interface somewhere.   For the record I do not have "Do Not Track" enabled, but that should not make a difference as that is request to servers not internal Safari setting.  <answer107891> If you open a new blank page in Safari (iOS 7.0.3), the second icon on the right in the bottom of the screen will bring you a menu. The second item in the menu is "History".  <answer107894> precode                             Click the bookmarks Button: /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vXzCp.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  precode               You will then need to click the Parent Folder button: /code/pre  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uNAlX.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  precode             Until you come to the beginning of the Bookmarks list. /code/pre  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/et3OX.png" alt="enter image description here"  precode               There you should see the history. /code/pre  <answer118658> I think this is a problem with IOS 7. My history doesn't have any records. Tried many different settings.  <answer120364> If your browser is black (top background) you are browsing in Private.   Open a new browser tab and in the lower left tap PRIVATE to turn it off. The background will become white and history will be tracked again.  <comment138419> Mark Hunter's answer explains how to find is. The feature is still there, but the interface has changed substantially. <comment225772> you saved my day Marc.
