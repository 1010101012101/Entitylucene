OS X 10.5 on macmini3,1 model? <body> To reproduce/debug an issue exclusive to OS X 10.5, i was trying install Leopard on my Mac Mini (model "macmini3,1", came with Snow Leopard).br However, when trying to boot from a Leopard install medium (tried both from DVD and USB stick) the machine just hangs:  ul liwhen manually choosing the boot medium: hangs with the boot medium selection screen still displayed /li liwhen running the install app from Snow Leopard and letting it restart the machine: hangs with the bright grayish screen and no logo or progress indicator/li /ul  Does anyone happen to know what could cause this / how to work around it?    Or could my models hardware be too new for 10.5? Although a web search suggests there were/are macmini3,1s with 10.5 running. Also, this question and it's resource suggest it should be working.  <answer56311> It sounds like you are trying to boot from a strongPower PC/strong version of the System on an strongIntel/strong processor computer.   <answer56327> The usual Apple way is that a set of generic OSX disks only support all machines that come out before that OS (How would any know what a new machine might have changed). Machines released after an OS release will include boot disks that can be loaded by that machine but earlier versions might not.  Thus I suspect that your mini is unsupported for Leopard or people bought it earlier with a leopard version for that machine.  <comment64609> Hm, how could i check that it is? I thought they had both PPC & Intel on the same disc? Both images i have access to exhibit the same behaviour - an unspecified retail image and the one from the developer center (only one version available there, no notes on Intel/PPC). <comment64617> If I recall correctly, mounting the DVD / USB on the Desktop should give you some sort of information regarding that. <comment64619> The install app works fine on the machine (until the hang after restart) and the Installation readme says "Intel process or Power PC G4" required. <comment64621> That gives no clue, I'm afraid. As the *readme* is talking about the 10.5, not that copy. I'm pretty sure this is the problem, as it happened to me once. I'll try to prove me right. <comment65310> Sadly it looks like this is the issue.
