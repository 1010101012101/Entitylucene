Only some contacts synced with iCloud <body> I would like to export all my contacts from my iPhone 5s to my Mac (OS X Yosemite) without connecting them physcically (e.g. USB). I have enabled the iCloud and SOME of my contact have been imported onto my laptop but by far not all. How can I make sure, all my contacts are exported to my Mac? Gosh, macs used to be so straight forward - now they are all about giving apple your data. hugely annoying. Thanks for your help!  <comment247715> I wonder if you have multiple contact groups on your phone.  Open contacts and click "groups" in the upper right.  If you find multiple groups try unchecking the iCloud group and then clicking done, are the remaining contacts the records that didn't transfer?  (You can recheck the iCloud selection at anytime and will not lose data with this test). If that's the case another entry you will want to know about is Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  (contacts section) Default Account.  Which is the default contact group.
