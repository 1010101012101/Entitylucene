Cannot send iMessages on my Mac but can receive them <body> I changed my main Apple ID email address yesterday, and also changed from my iPhone 5C to a iPhone SE.  Once I did changed my Apple ID email address, I had to sign out of all my devices, and sign back in with the new email cause I was getting error since the apps were trying to log in with the old email.  After that, everything was working on all devices except 1 thing. I cannot send iMessages from Messages on my Mac. iMessage is working on my iPhone correctly. I can receive iMessages on both Mac and iPhone. I can even send SMS (non-imessage) messages on my Mac. Really, all I can't do is to send iMessages from the Mac.  What I did : - Restarted my computer - Log out and back in of Messages on the Mac - Log out and back in of iCloud on the Mac - Deleted Messages related Preferences files - Deleted Keychain passwords that were using the old email  Not sure what else to try. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!  I'm running El Capitan by the way (10.11.4) on a 2012 15 inches Macbook Pro.  <comment286655> anyone? It really bugs me <comment287347> Nobody? Please, I really need to find a fix for this. I posted something on Apple's forum, but no luck
