Compiling xview on macOS Sierra <body> I'm trying to compile xview (aka XV) on what is now macOS Sierra.  The instructions I came across are for an old release of MacOS X 10.7.  The difficulty I'm facing is with the location of the X11 libraries.  I have latest Xcode and command line tools installed, as well as a functional homebrew installation.  My question: can someone give guidance on compiling X11 programs on the newer OS X releases, from El Capitan onward?  <comment320175> Did you try downloading XQuartz? <comment333774> Can you give a link to the source code you are tying to compile?
