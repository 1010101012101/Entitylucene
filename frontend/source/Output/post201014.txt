How does one Copy, Paste and Tab using AppleScript? <body> I am looking to automate Copy, Paste, Tab and Left in Microsoft Excel and either Safari or Firefox using Applescript. I have limited experience in coding, and have recently complied a code, but unfortunately it doesn't work as planned...  What I want to happen;  ol liemIn Browser/em Copy/li liemIn Excel/em Paste, Left, Copy/li liemIn Browser/em Tab, Paste, Tab x8/li liRepeat/li /ol    precoderepeat 50 times      tell application "Safari" to activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Safari"             keystroke "c" using command down         end tell     end tell      delay 0.3      tell application "Microsoft Excel" to activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Microsoft Excel"             keystroke "v" using command down             delay 0.3             key code 123             keystroke "c" using command down         end tell     end tell      tell application "Safari" to activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Safari"             keystroke tab             keystroke "v" using command down             keystroke tab             keystroke tab             keystroke tab             keystroke tab             keystroke tab             keystroke tab             keystroke tab             keystroke tab         end tell     end tell      delay 0.3  end repeat /code/pre  <answer201161> Its hard to know exactly what you are trying to accomplish but some improvements were introduced into the code below, with comments added in the code.  Several points:  ol liNote that depending on how fast/slow your system is responding you may need small delays after every keystroke or action.  You'll have to figure the minimum time empirically./li liAny time you "activate" or launch Safari, Excel or any application within the script there will be a delay until the app is up and running.  To deal with this,  you will need these apps running prior to running the script, or you need to introduce long enough delays into your script, or better yet you need to add code that pauses the script until the app is launched./li liWhen you open Safari and Excel you are not specifying any specific window, file or URL  to target for the subsequent keystrokes. So as written the script will default to the front window/tab of each app. I guess that's OK if what you are targeting is the front window. If no open window exists then the script will fail.  So for example, to get around this I added code to open a new excel file./li liAs currently constructed, the script copies from the front window in Safari, then eventually comes back to the very same window to execute the tab - paste - tab x 8. One has to assume that was the intention?  /li liAs currently constructed the default is to paste to cell A1 of Excel.  Then you tell Excel to move to once cell to the left, but there is no cell to the left of A1. /li liMuch of the code is written for GUI scripting.  Where possible its better to use Applescript commands to accomplish the desired activity.  I'll just leave it like that for now.  You probably have enough on your mind learning the basics right now.   precodetell application "Safari" to activate  tell application "System Events"     tell process "Safari"     keystroke "c" using command down     delay 0.3     end tell end tell   tell application "Microsoft Excel" to activate     delay 5 -- time required to launched Excel if not already open  tell application "System Events"     tell process "Microsoft Excel"     keystroke "n" using command down -- open new excel page     delay 0.5 -- wait for new excel page to open     keystroke "v" using command down     delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry     key code 123     delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry     keystroke "c" using command down     delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry end tell  end tell   tell application "Safari" to activate  tell application "System Events"     tell process "Safari"     keystroke tab     delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry     keystroke "v" using command down     delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry      repeat 8 times         keystroke tab         delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry     end repeat  end tell  end tell /code/pre/li /ol
