Snow Leopard, Active Directory : cannot save a file, but 'save as' is working <body> I'm using my Mac to connect to an Active Directory drive.  When I was running on Leopard, it worked fine : I could open, modify and save files from the remote drive.  Last week I upgraded my computer to Snow Leopard (10.6.7) and since that, I'm having problems : I still can connect to the remove drives, I can open files, but when I want to save them I get the following error : "codeThe document mydoc.txt could not be saved./code"  But if I do codeSave as/code and save the document under the very same name, then, it's working !  I have no idea what's wrong ! I tried to disconnect from the domain and reconnect, but I still have the problem.  <answer12885> I saw this posted on a Mac and Windows interop site,  Snow Leopard and Active Directory Tips and Reports Try the following from the article:     Solution: In a long session of trial and error, I tried saving to the administrative C$ share on my Windows 7 desktop, which was owned by "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller". Creating a share on Win 7 had the same error behavior as before, when the shared folders owner was changed to TrustedInstaller, it worked fine. The following challenge was to port that solution to a XP/2003 environment, which doesn't have that account. My boss, out of a leap of logic, tried the "NETWORK SERVICE" domain account as the owner of the folder on 2003, and everything works. Obviously the sharing/ntfs permissions have to be set properly on top of that. I'm sure I'm not the only one that's had this problem, so I figured I'd toss it at you guys.   Weird.  <answer13036> I found a workaround to the problem :  The path to the document was the following :  precodesmb://srv-fichiers1/Personnel/myhome/mydoc.txt /code/pre  The problem was that I didn't have read/write access to the codePersonnel/code folder.  The administrator added read/write access to this folder and now, everything is working fine.  I agree that this is more a workaround than a real solution, but it does the trick for me !  <comment13555> Do you have an ACL on that folder? <comment13719> thanks for the answer. I tried the solution mentionned, but the problem remains.
