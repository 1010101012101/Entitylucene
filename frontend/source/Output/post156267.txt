Problems creating Yosemite USB bootable drive <body> I was trying to make a USB boot loader for Yosemite using this command  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled 2 --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction /code/pre  I borrowed it from the original   precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction /code/pre  Which has worked for tons of people. The issue is for some reason it doesn't recognize the name of my volume is Untitled 2.  Error message:  precode/Volumes/Untitled is not a valid volume mount point. /code/pre  I don't understand why it isn't reading the 2. Is there another way to point the command to the partition without using the names given e.g. serial addressing?  <answer156269> Change    precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled 2 --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction /code/pre  to  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume "/Volumes/Untitled 2" --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction /code/pre  or  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled\ 2 --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction /code/pre  and it should work.  You have to escape spaces in paths in the command line either with a code\/code or quotation marks.  <answer156271> Use this path instead:  precode/Volumes/Untitled\ 2/ /code/pre  The backslash tells the terminal that the space is included in the path, otherwise it thinks your volume is called /Volumes/Untitled and that there is a random 2 argument in the command.  <answer195372> sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction  <comment183779> I liked your answer, it is simple yet it explains clearly. (+1) <comment183780> I appreciate the explanation. honestly I knew that I just didn't have my head in the right place I was so frustrated. Thanks for that. I had to mark the other answer as correct because I just copied his code haha
