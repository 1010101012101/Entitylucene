Forget how to... reduce dmg size by discarding unused space <body> I have a 250 GB DMG with a volume that only uses 75 GB. Is there a way to shrink the size of the DMG file to just the 75 GB? I feel like I've done this before but I can't remember how I did it... I want to still be able to boot into this puppy, so I can't just copy its contents into a folder. just don't want its DMG to use so much space...   <comment269897> You said, "I want to still be able to boot into this puppy", please explain and what is the contents of the .dmg file, is it a image of a bootable OS X install? <comment269931> Contents are a bootable volume... I wanted to make a partition for it, in order to boot from it...
