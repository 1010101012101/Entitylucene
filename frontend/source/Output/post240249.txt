Lost contact on iPhone! Any way to recover? <body> When i was deleting contacts on iphone yesterday, i mistakenly deleted another one with similar name! Any idea how to get it back?  <answer240261> Follow this:  ol liLogon to iCloud.com/li liGo to Settings/li liAt the bottom left you will see Advanced and "Restore Contacts"/li /ol  From there you will be able to restore a previous backup that iCloud has done.  <comment295558> Thank you, but i don't have backup in icloud...
