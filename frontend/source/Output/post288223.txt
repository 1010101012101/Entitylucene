Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable to VGA/DVI display? <body> I'm connecting a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) to an Epson PowerLite 811p Projector.  I need a 30-foot cable between them, and would prefer to use the HDMI cable I already have.  Is it possible to convert the signal twice, first from Mini Displayport to HDMI, then from HDMI to VGA or DVI?  <comment363963> How long is 'long'? You'll struggle to push the signal 15m over DVI alone, even without adaptors, unless they are powered converters. <comment363964> 30 feet, edited to clarify! <comment364058> I think your best bet is a single cable; less chance of error/signal loss.
