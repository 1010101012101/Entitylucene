connect AirPods to MacBook Air (Early 2014) with Sierra - Bluetooth pairing doesn't work <body> I followed the steps in Connect AirPods to MacBook / Macbook Pro with Mac OS Sierra (warning, Youtube video).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x5ddd.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried and tried and never see AirPods.  I have a Early 2014 MacBook Air with Sierra. Does this only works with new MacBooks? Is there a technical reason?  <answer278285> After installing the update macOS Sierra 10.12.4 the connection to AirPods working fine.  In release notes About the macOS Sierra 10.12.4 Update nothing about AirPods written.  <comment350167> I couldn't find it in the AirPod tech specs, either. It just says, "macOS Sierra." Very strange. https://support.apple.com/kb/SP750
