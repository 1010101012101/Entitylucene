Is there a gesture to navigate back to previous page in iPad 2 (or the new iPad)? <body> I've just bought a new iPad, but it's so annoying when I have to click the arrow on the top left of the page to navigate back and forth using Safari. I wonder is there a gesture for navigating that I'm not aware of?  <answer44189> Safari on a standard iPad does not have a gesture for returning to the previous page.   <comment50218> Sadly and strangely the three-finger swipe doesn't work for back or forward. Not sure why they wouldn't have enabled it. <comment50226> Thanks. I wonder is there a way to work around this problem?
