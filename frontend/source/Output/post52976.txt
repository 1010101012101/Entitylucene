How do I compose email first and then add a group to the bcc line? <body> I like to compose my email messages first and then add recipients.  I created a smart group that I would like to add to the BCC line after composing a message, however I can't seem to find a way to do this.  I am using the default Mail application.  <answer53113> If I understand your problem well enough, in the Apple Mail program, once you have written your email you can click on View-BCC Address Field and that should open the BCC space to add your group.  <comment60574> What program are you using?
