How do I install an application for just one user? <body> How do I install an application for just one user, without using administrative permissions or affecting any other users?  <answer13965> Just put the application in the home of the user. You could create folders like this for every user:  precode/Users/&lt;username1&gt;/Applications /Users/&lt;username2&gt;/Applications /code/pre  and put the application(s) there.  <comment15725> The nice thing about mac os x is apps can typically run from anywhere.  It's best for sanity to put them in the application folders (system and or user) but not strictly required. <comment18318> Hmm, interesting, since I have the same question - but I don't have a /User/(myusername) only /User/someotheruser/, and /User is owned by root! <comment175760> When I trie to do this it creates a shortcut. Is there a way to move it completely (dropbox)?
