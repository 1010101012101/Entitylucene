Cannot upgrade VirtualBox installation of Mac OS 10.6.8 to Mavericks - supposedly a processor issue <body> I'm running Mac OS X 10.6.8 within VirtualBox 4.3.2 on a Windows machine with an i7 processor. I would like to upgrade my OS to Mavericks through the App Store. When I try to do so, I get the erroneous error message that my processor does not meet the new operating system's requirements.  Any ideas on how to resolve this issue?  <answer116878> Don't know if this is still valid, but for anyone having the same problem, just set the Machine version to "10.6 Snow Leopard" instead of the generic "Mac OS X":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KlwWC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  That did the trick for me.
