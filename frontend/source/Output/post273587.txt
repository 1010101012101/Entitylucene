Problem restoring photo library from time machine backup <body> I have copied the photo library (from the backup) to the pictures folder, am holding down the option key when launching the photos program, am selecting the photos library, then I get an error message: "An error occurred while restoring permissions. Photos was unable to repair permissions on your library". How can I fix this and restore my photo library?  <comment343954> Possible duplicate of [Restore Photos library from Time Machine](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188846/restore-photos-library-from-time-machine) <comment343958> @Tolsadus: looks different to me. <comment343960> @allie: Did you click Time Machine's "Restore" button or just drag the library? Apparently [there can be different effects](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7477728). Also, try having Photos repair the library by holding down both Command and Option keys while launching the app.
