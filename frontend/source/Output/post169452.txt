I have opened a program from a website, has my MBP been infected with a virus? <body> I have opened a file on https://kickass.so/revenge-s04e14-hdtv-x264-lol-ettv-t10127520.html. I was supposed to click on a torrent file but I clicked on the big DOWNLOAD link.  And I had no idea that  I was not supposed to open a dmg file. Anyway, done is done. I opened it, and there was an install file, I double clicked on it. Then I was not asked to do anything, it just directed me to a website.   How do I make sure I do not have a virus or spyware? Running AIR'13 Yosemite. The file name was codemacfest/code. The content looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wzrAV.png" alt="enter image description here"  I also used Sophos Anti-virus and it detected codeOSX/FkCodec-A/code in the dmg file that I trashed.  <answer169461> About the website you visited should give you some idea what you downloaded.  Here is Feb. 2015 Whois Record showing the site was banned (closed) by the Authorities.  So what ever you downloaded, get rid of it, it can not be trusted.  http://venturebeat.com/2015/02/09/kickasstorrents-goes-down-after-its-domain-is-seized-but-makes-a-quick-return/  http://kickasstorrents.eu/news/kickasstorrents-is-not-shut-down-kat-ph-domain-seized/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/szN3s.jpg" alt="kickass"  As long you only downloaded the dmg and not installed it your should be fine by just deleting that dmg package.  <comment199081> I also used Sophos Anti-virus and it detected OSX/FkCodec-A in the dmg file that I trashed. <comment199920> Any half-decent malware/adware/PUP will place files with a different bundle identifier than the original installer, making this worthlessâ€¦? <comment225316> @grgarside I am very grateful for your opinions that are just that, since you were not able to provide a correct answer anyway. <comment232901> What was the file name of the DMG, the installer and what was the domain you got directed to? You probably don't have a virus if the installer you opened didn't ask for a password. <comment232902> Thanks, updated the question. The filename is macfest and the content is shown in the quest. <comment232903> It looks like it will set your homepage and install an extension. Both can be checked from preferences (system preferences and browser-specific preferences). Extensions might also end up in the internet plug-ins directory which resides in the library directory (home and/or system wide).
