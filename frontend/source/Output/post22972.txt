How to enable subtitle in Front Row in Lion <body> I did a workaround to enable Front Row in: Lion http://9to5mac.com/2011/07/19/os-x-lion-kills-front-row-heres-how-to-get-it-back/  But it doesn't work with subtitles (got black screen). Anyone knows how to fix that?  <comment25652> Which movie trailer do you have in mind, and in which iTunes (Country) ?? <comment25655> it's not movie trailers, it's just .avi files in my Movies folders.
