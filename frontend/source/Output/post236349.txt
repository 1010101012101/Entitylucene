IOS App that allows you to takes photos every X seconds and saving it in the camera toll (no time lapse) <body> community  Is there an IOS app that allows you to capture photos every X seconds and automatically saves it in the camera roll (not like a time lapse that puts it in a single video)  Thanks a lot! :)  <answer236353> This app does the trick. It will save files to the camera roll. You can turn off the movie rendering.  IntervalCam - Create Timelapse Movies by TritheCat Studio https://appsto.re/us/RunTR.i
