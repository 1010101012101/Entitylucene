Mac behaving weirdly with VPN/Compressed Files/Disk Images, all Problems Started at Once <body> I have a 2013 Mac Pro (the black cylinder). I rarely turn it off. I recently went on holiday for 10 days and have returned to some weird behaviour.  If it is left running for a day or so it will suddenly refuse to mount .dmg files, uncompress any compressed file format be it zip, rar, 7z or otherwise through the native decompression software, terminal software, or keka. And it auto-boots me from my VPN after 10-30 seconds whether I connect manually or via my VPN provider's software.  It also disconnects itself from my wireless network when the problems start, but has no trouble reconnecting.  Normally I'd have no reason to suspect these three problems are linked, but they all began while I was away and all disappear for roughly 24 hours after restarting the machine.  I'm a fairly advanced Mac user and have spent a lot of time fixing and maintaining Macs and I've never encountered anything like this. I can't see anything running rogue in activity monitor.   I'm running Sierra (10.12.5) with Server installed. Mac Pro (late 2013) 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 AMD FirePro D300 2048MB x2  <comment362515> Have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257)?  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  Also reset [SMC](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295) and [NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063) <comment362516> @Allan AHT is reporting all clear. And I reset SMC and NVRAM two nights ago to have the problem crop back up tonight.  Another thing I forgot to mention is that recently it has started flickering the monitor upon log in. But I put that down to switching from an HDMI lead to a Mini DP - HDMI lead. <comment362517> What kinds of software do you use? Any system modding software, or antivirus software? <comment362518> @WilliamTFroggard There's not much. The only thing close to system modding that's been on this machine since I last did a total reinstall is NerdTool and I removed it because it's not running well under Sierra. If there's any traces it's left behind I haven't been able to track them down.  No antivirus but I installed malwarebytes earlier to do a sweep and it didn't flag anything. <comment362519> My first thought was "Maybe you're getting hacked", but no hacker would disconnect the wifi. Strange situation there. <comment362520> @WilliamTFroggard I had the same thought. But they'd have to be committed, everything I have is locked down like crazy. And there's not much benefit to be had hacking me. There's nothing interesting to make it worth the effort. That and the WiFi thing make it a bit pointless. <comment362522> For grins and giggles, try installing a clean copy of Sierra on a USB drive to see if the problems go away.  It won't be speedy by any means, but it's just for diags.  This way we can narrow it down to either a system problem or an OS problem. <comment362532> How much free space do you have on your hard drive(s)? <comment362604> @Allan Good idea! I'll give that a shot when I get home. <comment362605> @AlistairMcMillan Not at the computer at the moment but from memory around 50 gig when I checked last night. <comment362654> @TimHope When you are having these problems I'd check how much free hard drive space you have. From memory I've had similar problems where I've run out of free space on my hard drive. macOS doesn't seem that great (or at least not very insistent) about warning you when this is happening. <comment363450> Finally got back to this, found more weird symptoms. Can't take a screenshot after it has happened. Opening a terminal window now reports: "[forkpty: Resource temporarily unavailable] [Could not create a new process and open a pseudo-tty.]" Going to try to boot from a usb drive. <comment363451> There doesn't seem to be any memory problems, Activity monitor is reporting 9 of 12 gig used. The only place I can find any reports of that bash error are with nvm (which is installed) causing an alias loop and filling memory.
