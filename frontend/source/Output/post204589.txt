Turn non-resizeable windows into resizeable windows <body> On Windows I was using a program that could turn non-resizeable windows into resizeable windows. It's called ResizeEnable.  I would like to know if someone knows about such a software on Mac? This would be to use for example with System Preferences, in the Keyboard - Services - Shortcuts section to see all the items without scrolling...br Or with any window not having the green button enabled.
