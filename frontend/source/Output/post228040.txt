MacBook Pro not booting beyond mounting Recovery HD <body> For some reason El Capitan doesn't boot. I've tried reinstalling from Recovery and nothing happened. The disk checked is ok.  I can use the cmd+s or Terminal. Here is the verbose boot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fArFM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer228042> It looks like your hard drive has been corrupted somehow.  Use Internet Recovery (kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdR/kbd while booting) to recover/restore your machine.  You do back ups, right?  More than likely, your drive has failed.  Based on what I was able to make out in the (blurry) picture, the error codeBSD root: disk0s2, major 1, minor 2/code is very similar to this post:  OSX system and installation disk won&#39;t boot  I have personally experienced (just last week, actually) a similar situation and it too was a HDD failure.  You can also try running this command from the command line to get the SMART Status of your drive:  codediskutil info disk0 | grep SMART/code  If you get anything other than codeVerified/code, your drive is failing; it's time to replace.  <comment277967> No I don't :-(  . But why the disk utility says it's ok. ? I can also access  to the vol through command line <comment277969> A new one added. Sorry <comment277970> Still bad quality. <comment277976> Are you accessing the normal partition or the recovery partition through Terminal?  I would bet you are accessing the recovery partition.  It would be more helpful if you post a clearer picture of your screen. <comment277977> I forgot to ask...Which MBP (year and specs) do you have?
