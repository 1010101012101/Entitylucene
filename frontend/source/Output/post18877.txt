Is there a sexier alternative to the status bar in Safari? <body> I hate the status bar. However, I love hovering over URLs to find out where they will take me. Is there an alternative to having the status bar on at all times, or constantly toggling on/off? An extension, or maybe a preference that I'm missing?  <answer18878> I like the free UltimateStatusBar extension.  Visible only when you're hovering over a link, it shows where things lead, but does other stuff too. Like shortener expansion and favicon previews.  It's got lots of built-in themes you can use to customize the appearance.  <comment20679> Holy crap that's awesome! A ton of really cool features too. Only question - why isn't it in the Safari Extensions gallery on Apple's site? <comment20680> @bpapa Apple requires that you submit your extension for approval for that gallery. The developer may not have submitted it, or Apple may have rejected it (who knows why). <comment21406> It actually is in the gallery, I just didn't notice at the time. False alarm! This is a great extension.
