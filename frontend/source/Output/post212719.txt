How to get rid of a shared folder on Mac <body> How to remove strongShared/strong folder with strongbsozasss/strong files? I somehow got this from my second PC and have no idea how and what this is? How can I remove this and disable this kind of sharing? I am on El Capitan.   Here is the screenshoot:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NgIDY.png" alt="folder"  <answer212750> Open a Finder window, then open preferences (Finder  Preferences...). Go to the 'Sidebar' tab and uncheck the options under 'Shared':  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JOOQ1.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want to make sure emyour/em computer doesn't appear on emother/em computers like this, go to System Preferences  Sharing and uncheck File Sharing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5E7fH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment256867> Note that turning off the "Shared" options in Finder preferences doesn't really turn off any sort of sharing. "bsozasss" is another computer on your network, and it has some sort of file (or screen) sharing turned on; after turning off the Finder option, it'll still be on your network and still offering to share files and/or its screen, it's just that your Finder will stop showing it in the sidebar.
