I am Unable to Uninstall an Applications like Node or Atom in OS X <body> I just bought a Macbook Pro and I'm new to OSX. I can't uninstall applications like Node, Atom, etc. They are not shown in my Application folder  nor in the Launcher.  How can i delete them?'  Below is screenshot of my Applications folder.  However, if I search for Atom using Spotlight,  I can access it from there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mvW76.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer231305> Have you tried emptying your trash? Spotlight can find and open (IIRC) applications that remain in trash.  If after your trash is emptied emand/em you still see Atom or Node, try, in Terminal:  precodesudo find / -iname 'thing' /code/pre  in which you should substitute codething/code with your search query.  strongEDIT:/strong in Spotlight, when you hold kbdCommand/kbd, does it show a path at the bottom of the spotlight window?  strongEDIT 2:/strong As per @Lizzan's comment, do check your Downloads, Documents, and any other user-related folders.  <comment282454> it says Santoshs-MacBook-Pro:~ santosh$ find / -iname 'atom' find: /.DocumentRevisions-V100: Permission denied find: /.fseventsd: Permission denied find: /.Spotlight-V100: Permission denied find: /.Trashes: Permission denied  and my trash is empty i had installed those app but never uninstall them <comment282459> Hold on, are you trying to *find the app* or *remove the app*? <comment282460> To remove those messages just prepend a `sudo` to the command <comment282499> How have you installed these applications? If you mean just downloaded them, they might still be in you Downloads folder. <comment282517> i can find them using spotlight i want to remove them completely <comment282593> Look at my edit; when you press Command, does a path bar show at the bottom of the Spotlight window?
