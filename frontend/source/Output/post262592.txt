Reminders badge shows wrong count on different devices <body> Im having iPhone, iPad, Macbook and Mac mini and using Reminders on all my devices synced through iCloud. I have several lists created and no incomplete items at the moment. However Reminders badge count on Macbook shows "2" while on Mac mini shows "1". On both iPhone and iPad the count is none ("0"), which is correct. If I check on my iCloud.com account the count is also none. Where do these phantom alerts come from then? And how do I get rid of them?  <answer265101> I had same problem on my new iPhone 7plus. Fixed it by doing the reboot by holding sleep wake  and volume down buttons and then turning back on.  <answer265114> You can try force refresh Reminders in iCloud with a debug trick:  Go to Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and enter the following command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.reminders RemindersDebugMenu 1 /code/pre  Now open Reminder (or restart the app) and you will see a debug menu, go into that menu and click Refresh, and see if it solves your problem.  Here is a picture of that menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzGID.png" alt="Reminder Debug Menu"  To get rid of the debug menu enter this command:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.reminders RemindersDebugMenu /code/pre  Then restart Reminder app.  <answer278689> On iOS there's no need to reboot for updating the reminders badge notification. Just open the Calendar App, press "Calendars" and pull down the entire page for updating all of your Calendars. This will force the update of your reminders too.  <answer296181> Found an answer here:   http://peterheide.com/2012/09/06/how-to-fix-a-stuck-dock-badge-in-os-x/  It worked for me when everything else failed.  <comment374071> Welcome to Ask Different!
