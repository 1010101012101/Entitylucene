AppleTV (2) How do I turn off the video title overlay in the lower left hand corner of the screen when playing a playlist? <body> How do I turn off the video title overlay in the lower left hand corner of the screen?  I'm running a video playlist on an Apple TV gen2.  The playlist is running through the "Computer" app.  At the start of each video that title overlay appears and I'd rather it not.  I'm trying to use it as a kiosk in an art gallery.
