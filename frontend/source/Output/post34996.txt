Make vim read the vimrc from ~/.vim/vimrc <body> This may not be the best place to ask this question but I'm having trouble getting vim to read my vimrc file. If I have it in the home directory as ~/.vimrc then it ready just fine but if I move it ~/.vim/vimrc so that I can take advantage of plugins and a few other things, it no longer reads the vimrc. I can't remember what I was supposed to do to make it read the correct vimrc.  <answer34999> The easiest way would be to remain using a ~/.vimrc file, if for no other reason than using it to read in your sub-folder based .vimrc  Putting something like the below in your ~/.vimrc should work:  precodeif filereadable("~/.vim/vimrc")         source ~/.vim/vimrc endif /code/pre  I don't recall if vim expands home directories or not. I imagine it does, but if it does not, just use:  precodeif filereadable("/Users/yourusername/.vim/vimrc")         source /Users/yourusername/.vim/vimrc endif /code/pre  <answer35002> I created a symlink.  codeln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc/code  Works like a charm.  <answer35004> A method of blindly loading all your plugins, assuming they are all in ~/.vim/plugins, would be putting the following in your ~/.vimrc:  precodesource glob(~/.vim/plugins/*.vim) /code/pre  <comment39893> You should explain more about 'take advantage of plugins', because nothing I know of would prefer you from using ~/.vimrc for everything. <comment39894> When I was in Ubuntu and I started using vim plugins it had me make a .vim directory and inside that a plugins directory and move my .vimrc to the .vim directory <comment39895> I used to use vimbuddy (before I had plugins that actually did something functional), installed in ~/.vim/plugins, and I just used `source ~/.vim/plugins/vimbuddy.vim` from within my ~/.vimrc file. <comment209470> Perfect! Thanks :D
