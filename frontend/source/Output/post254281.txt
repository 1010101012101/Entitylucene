Can't send text and call but can receive text messages and data only <body> I'm using iPhone 5s with iOS 10. I can't send text messages and can't make calls. I can't even receive calls I can only receive text messages and only data.  I have tried:  ul liChecking if SIM card is working/li liReseting my phone and setting it as a new iPhone/li liResetting carrier settings/li /ul  Can anyone suggest what else should I try in order to fix this?   <comment316609> I am assuming you just upgraded to iOS 10.  Was it working in iOS 9?  Have you tried downgrading back to iOS9 (I'm assuming you did a backup prior to upgrading)
