Get count of items in iBooks <body> Is there a way to see how many items are in the iBooks app? I have looked within the app and in SettingsGeneral (where the song count is) to no avail.  I would like help on both MacOS X and iOS 9.  <answer234726> If you are looking at the iBooks "All Books" and you Select All and then, with everything still selected you click on one book and keep the mouse button down and then drag just a tiny bit, as if you were going to move the books somewhere--- if you do all that, you will see a little red circle with the number of selected items in it, attached to your cursor. See the picture. The purple arrow is pointing to the red circle with (in this case) "90" in it.  You do have to move the books a little bit but you don't have to move them far for the selected count to show up.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MFrJ.png" alt="90 books selected"  <comment286979> Wow! I thought I was missing something obvious, but this is pretty stupid for Apple. Thanks. <comment286985> You're welcome. Great question. I had to experiment. Now I know something new!
