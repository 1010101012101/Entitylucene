iVPN Connection Problems <body> I want a way to create a secure connection to the internet (something I can trust) on my iPod Touch and Laptop through a source I can trust. In my research, it was suggested I use iVPN on my iMac at home to set up the connection. So I bought that and tried it out. The VPN client connects, but I cannot navigate to the internet. Any thoughts on how to fix it?  <answer410> Doing so would require being able to access your iMac from remote places, thus configuring either a DMZ host, or port forwarding on your router. Either way it will be a headache.   Also if you're on a residential connection note that the public IP address can and will change. I recommend a dynamic DNS server for that.    Assuming you can get that all setup it's as simple as setting up VPN on your iDevice.  <comment227> I don't understand what you're trying to achieve, do you use your Laptop as router and connecting the iPod Touch to it with a VPN ? <comment301> No. I want to use my iMac (sorry didn't clarify that) that sits at home and use that to provide a secure connection to the internet when at the coffee shop or other public places. <comment392> This is all setup already. The problem is the routing from VPN connection to the internet. It isn't working.
