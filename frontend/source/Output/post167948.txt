Install software from an unverified source <body> I'm using a MacBook with the latest Yosemite update and I need to install a tool from a 3rd party website. (not from the Mac App Store)  I'm new to Mac OS X, can the tool access my files after I installed it?   I read that apps are sandboxed but does that mean that viruses, keyloggers and that stuff are not able to harm the MacBook?  <comment196962> the short answer is yes!, so what software are you installing? <comment196964> Apps are sandboxed only if they are from the AppStore - even then it is not a complete sandbox - and Apple don't rigoursly test everything. So expect any app to access any file - you have to work out how trustworthy the developer is <comment197068> Ok, so is it possible to run 3rd party software in a "sandbox" that protects the MacBook from viruses and stuff? <comment334651> You can use a virtual machine such as [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
