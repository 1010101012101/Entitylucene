Mac Book Pro - Display blink issue <body> suddenly, I am getting issue in my mac book pro of display blink issue, When I start mac book, It starting to blink and then black screen.  I ask at service center and they told to replace with new screen. But it's too costly, If it's only screen display problem then can we attach mac book to external LCD/LED screen? Can it work?  Thanks for the guidance!  <comment263508> Could you update the question with the model MacBook and version of OS X you are using? Click the apple in the menu bar  About this Mac if you are unsure. <comment263610> @agentroadkill I am unable to see screen as it blinks and then black, I will check in my invoice and update here.
