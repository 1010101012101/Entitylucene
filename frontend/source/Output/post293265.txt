Count in empty mailboxes <body> I use several smart mailboxes in Apple Mail. Eventually they get into a confused state showing a non zero count even though the boxes are empty and do not show any messages. The counts for real mail boxes are correct.  How do I correct the smart mailbox counts? (This used to work in older versions of OSX pre Mavericks? or earlier, I am now on Sierra)
