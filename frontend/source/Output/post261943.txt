Standard iMac pmset <body> I recently got a new iMac 5k late 2015 with 2Tb Fusion drive. Ever since arrival, it had sleep problems. It would go to sleep and wake without any problems except if it went into standby(after 3 hours of sleep). When waking the screen was black  with some red graphics glitch on top where the menu bar is, it would go to a login screen only if i kept pressing different keys. After fiddling in the terminal I saw that in codepmset -g/code standby was 1, so I removed standby like so codesudo pmset -a standby 0/code  Now all seems ok.  emMy question is, do iMacs need to have codestandby 0/code by default and mine was activated by mistake or does it have a hardware fault that should be checked ASAP?/em  I checked another iMac and saw that it had codestandby 0/code as well. I don't know what to believe.  This is my codepmset -g/code:  precodestandby              0 Sleep On Power Button 1 womp                 1 halfdim              1 hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage powernap             1 autorestart          0 networkoversleep     0 disksleep            1 sleep                10 (sleep prevented by Google Chrome, coreaudiod) autopoweroffdelay    28800 hibernatemode        3 autopoweroff         1 ttyskeepawake        1 displaysleep         10 standbydelay         10800 /code/pre  Activated hibernatemode 3 just in case power went off when it's in sleep.
