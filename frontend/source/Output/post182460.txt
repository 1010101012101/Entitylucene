Can I use a Early 2011 MacBook Pro 13" charger with my Late 2013 MacBook Pro 13" with the MagSafe Adapter? <body> I bought a Early 2011 MacBook Pro 13" but eventually upgraded to a newer Retina Late 2013 13" model.  I'd like to get another charger, but I'm curious if I could use the old charger that came with that laptop with this new one if I buy the MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adapter.  They both use a 60W adapter, so I don't see a reason why they shouldn't work.  <answer182461> Simple answer-- yes you can! there should be no any problems.  <comment217240> Great, thanks!  I'll mark this as correct when Stack Exchange lets me. <comment217242> Don't worry about that, go now and charge :)
