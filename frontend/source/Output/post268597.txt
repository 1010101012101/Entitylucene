App Submission: Where do I put my EULA (End User License Agreement)? <body> My video chat app submission recently got rejected, and these are the reasons they listed:     We encourage you to review your app concept and remove the functionality that randomly connects users. Users must be identifiable with a profile and have the ability to initiate and accept chat requests from other users. It is also necessary that you put all of the following precautions in place:      ul   liRequire that users agree to terms (EULA); these terms must make it clear that there is no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users/li   liA method for filtering objectionable content/li   liA mechanism for users to flag objectionable content/li   liA mechanism for users to block abusive users/li   liThe developer must act on objectionable content reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content/li   /ul   My question is, I thought every app uses Apple's EULA by default, so what is the first stipulation about (or is that just a reminder?)?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ynOH.png" alt=""  I downloaded a similar app called Cha Cha, which doesn't force the user to "Agree" to the EULA, I also downloaded another app called Cake, which does have the EULA when you sign up.  Should setting it to Apple's EULA good enough? If not, would putting a link to it in the description suffice?  <answer268600> When you choose the Custom EULA option on iTunes Connect, you can submit an EULA to a new field shown for the app on iTunes Connect, which is then shown under a separate button on the App Store product page.  <comment337290> Is this required? Or can I just use Apple's? <comment337291> @Edmund When you implement features Apple's EULA doesn't cover, you'll need to add your own. For Apple to tell you that you need to provide an EULA, it's very likely this is the case. <comment337292> ooo thanks! So is setting it in iTunes Connect good enough? Or do I need to show it in app? <comment337294> @Edmund I've never included an EULA in my actual app (only on iTunes Connect), but then I've never been rejected with the reason you have! It seems like you're doing some pretty strange things with the ‘randomly connecting users’ that Apple might not really like, in which case an EULA inside the app might be required. I'm not certain. <comment337295> Yeh I eventually added a sign up flow so that people have "profiles". Thanks I'll try just setting it in itunes connect <comment337296> @Edmund Let me know how it goes, I'd be interested to see what they say! <comment337297> Will do. thanks <comment337310> Yes, I'd also appreciate seeing how you go. Thanks! :)
