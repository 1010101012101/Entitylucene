Data on file exchange partition is owned by 1000 and locked. How can I unlock this in OS X? <body> I have created a file exchange permission that both OS X Lion and Ubuntu 12.04 can write to and read from. This partition is formatted as...  precodeApple_HFS Exchange   /code/pre  ...with journaling disabled. I have copied a folder from Ubuntu onto that partition. This folder appears as locked in OS X and I am not able to unlock this folder. The option is greyed out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pc4lD.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0O3pd.png" alt="enter image description here"  The permission of this folder are:  precodedrwxr-xr-x   4 1000      1000      136 11 Mai 14:43 Bilder /code/pre  ul liHow can I unlock this file in OS X?/li liHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?/li /ul  <answer51103> h2Unlocking the file/h2  You can unlock files from within the terminal using the codechflags/code command with codenouchg/code:  precodesudo chflags -R nouchg Bilder /code/pre  According to the man page for chflags:  ul licodeuchg/code is the user immutable flag/li licodeno/code in front of a flag removes the flag: codenouchg/code/li /ul  h2Preventing this from happening in the future/h2  A general solution would probably be to avoid handling permission altogether and using NTFS or FAT for an exchange partition.  However, I specifically voided such a solution (FAT32) this time, because I encountered serious errors the last time.
