Is there any Thunderbold/USB 3.1 adaper?   Thanks a lot  <answer251379> Yes, there's adapters all over the place.  Look at Amazon (I found this one for about $7 US) and Monoprice.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WPWHN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uE2ZU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
