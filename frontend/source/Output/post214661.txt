Wifi requires reconnection regularly <body> I am using a Macbook Pro 15 (Late 2014), running El Captain. Sometimes, the wifi appears connected, although there is no actual connection, the pages just fail to load, looks like it is trying to resolve indefinitely. To correct, I need to turn Wifi Off and back on, and it immediately corrects the problem and the connection appears strong for a few minutes, until the issue reoccurs.. The issue happens 1-2 times per hour.   Any suggestions on what is causing this or what I need to do?
