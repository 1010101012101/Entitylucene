Unable to connect to the internet on my iMac despite being connected to the network <body> For the last several months, I have used wifi to connect to the internet through an unsecured wifi network that my organization controls - had been working fine since last night. Today my iMac shows that I am connected to the proper network same as always but I am unable to connect to the internet in any way (web browsers, ssh, ping, etc.). The Network settings show me as connected and assigned proper IP and DNS numbers. Renewing DHCP Lease doesn't seem to make a difference. Also because this is a large wifi network managed by an organization and not me personally I contacted the administrator to make sure I hadn't been blacklisted (I had not) and also tried spoofing a new MAC address, which also didn't work. I also know that it is not an issue with the router itself as I am typing this from another device right next to my iMac connected to the same access point (several other devices are also connected with no problem).  I'm unsure if it has any significance but I had been running a bitcoin node for several weeks on the computer and began running a tor relay a few days ago but my internet had been working since configuring the relay. I also tried stopping both services and checking that all processes were gone with codeps/code, which didn't do anything. The output of codeifconfig/code also looks normal to me and my computer seems to be acting normal other than this issue but I'm at a loss for how to continue debugging this problem. Has anyone encountered anything similar or have any suggestions?   Edit:  It is a 2015 5K 27 in iMac running the most updated version of 10.11  <answer277852> Below are a number of things you can try (apologies for anything emobvious/em, but I take nothing for granted).  strongRestart the iMac/strong  Does restarting the iMac do anything? Rebooting can often resolve these types of issues.  strongDisable/Enable Wi-Fi/strong  Similar to restarting, but without needing to. You can use the Wi-Fi menu to turn Wi-Fi off. Try this for about a minute and then turn it back on. This also often works.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps boot your Mac into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your iMac/li liRestart your iMac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. can you now connect to the Wi-Fi network)/li liTo exit Safe Mode just restart your Mac as normal/li /ol  The act of booting into Safe Mode will actually perform a number of background tasks, and this often resolves issues when you've rebooted normally.  Once you've tried the above let me know how you go.  strong[EDIT]/strong  Okay, let's continue troubleshooting...  strongRun Wireless Diagnostics/strong  You can use Wireless Diagnostics to analyse your Wi-Fi network. Follow these steps:  ul liClose any apps you have running/li liConnect to the Wi-Fi network/li liHold down the kbdoption/kbd key and go to the Wi-Fi status menu and select Open Wireless Diagnostics/li liEnter your administrator name and password/li /ul  Now follow the steps to see whether any problems are found.  strongTry another 'Wi-Fi' network/strong  It'd be interesting to see whether your iMac can get internet connectivity from another Wi-Fi network. Can you share an internet connection from an iPhone's cellular connection (or similar) and connect to that via your iMac's Wi-Fi port? Does this allow your iMac to browse the web, send/receive emails, etc?  If you can't get an internet connection, then I'd be testing your hardware, although it may be worth first resetting the NVRAM and SMC (in that order). See below for steps.  strongReset NVRAM/strong  Your iMac uses Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) to store many of its settings. You can reset this with the following steps:  ol listrongShut down your iMac./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. You have to make sure you press these keys strongbefore/strong the gray screen appears or it wonâ€™t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your iMac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li liLet go of the keys and let your iMac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  Now proceed to resetting the SMC.  strongReset the SMC/strong  Your iMac has a System Management Controller. It may be worth you resetting this too:  ol liShut down your iMac/li liUnplug it from power/li liWait 15 seconds/li liPlug the power cord back in/li liWait for an additional 5 seconds/li liPress the power button to turn it back on/li /ol  How does your iMac go with connecting now?  strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong  If all else has failed, follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your iMac/li liRestart your iMac/li listrongImmediately/strong press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  <comment349686> Can you clarify the exact model of iMac and version of macOS? <comment349695> @Monomeeth It is a 2015 5K 27 in iMac running the most updated version of 10.11 <comment349696> I didn't think about safe mode thanks for the suggestion, unfortunately it doesn't work under safe mode either. Same problem, shows that it is connected and assigned an IP but I'm unable to access the internet <comment349699> Please issue the following command `route -n get default | grep gateway`.  Whatever IP you get, will be your gateway.  Ping that address (Example: `ping 192.168.1.1`)  If it responds back, issue the next command `ping 4.4.4.4`  Edit your original question with the results. <comment349701> Ping does not work, request timeout - 100% packet loss. I'd update with a copy paste but I'm using a different laptop @Allan <comment349703> Which address did you attempt to ping to? <comment349705> Just updated my answer with some additional troubleshooting steps. As an aside, I don't suppose that the office's Wi-Fi network can be reset? <comment349718> @Allan both my gateway and `4.4.4.4` <comment349759> That means your machine isn't capable of taking on the network.  Issue the following command:  `sudo ipconfig set en1 DHCP`.  Then issue the command `ipconfig getpacket en1` and post the results. <comment349843> Unfortunately it can't be reset. I tried running the diagnostics and it said no problems, clearing the NVRAM and resetting SMC was also unsuccessful <comment349844> What is it you want to see? I am unable to post anything from this machine. It seems to be giving me proper addresses, same as before
