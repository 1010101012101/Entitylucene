Formatting and Reinstalling OSX, Volume fails verification, repair fails, reformatting does not fix issue. Hard drive issue? <body> Title bascily. The Macbook in question has been giving some trouble for a while, my sister (the owner) looked up the issue and apparently it was caused by the update to Sierra and the reported fix was to reinstall the OS.   Ok fine. Go to reinstall and the install fails, and it can't repair it.   Ok again fine, data's already backed up recently, so next is step format the drive. Boot back into recovery and wipe the drive. That works fine. Go to verify and then that fails. Repair also fails. Tells me to backup and format. Do it again, same issue.   Boot into internet recovery, try again same issue.   Is the hard drive buggered or is there another issue I'm missing?   <comment344378> There's always the possibility it's the SATA cable not the drive - it crops up a lot on here. Not sure how you could check that yourself. <comment344526> It'd be good to know what exact model of MacBook you're talking about. But a hard drive failure is certainly a possibility, along with what @Tetsujin already suggested. <comment344753> mid 2012 macbook pro iirc?
