MATLAB disabled status in Yosemite <body> I have 2013a installed and the patch from here. The patch should work, but when I navigate to the application, there is a "stop" icon above the app icon img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlqP1.png" alt="enter image description here"which still prevents the patched version from launching. How can I remove this disabled status? For now I can only launch matlab from inside the app content.  <answer152484> It seems to be related to this bug report.  Does the application run if you open it via terminal? e.g  precodeopen /Applications/MATLAB_R2013a.app /code/pre  if so you may just need to clear dock/icon caches:  precodekillall -HUP Dock /code/pre  <answer157487> Well. After the 10.10.1 update, the disabled status icon is gone.  <comment179700> Well. This doesn' t work. It still stays at disabled status after reboot. Run via terminal works, as I mentioned.
