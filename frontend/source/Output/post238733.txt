Moved to iPhone from Google - Replace phone app <body> I was a long time google android user for my phone.  On the google phone I could type in numbers that represented letters and it would pull up a contact for instance if I entered 62 on my google phone I'd get contacts for Mark Marcus etc...(6 being m/n/o and 2 being a/b/c).  But on my iphone if I use the stock phone app there is no such functionality.  Is there a setting to turn this on?  Trying to call someone on the iphone requires you to go to your contacts and find them and then to dial them.  This doesn't seem to be intuitive.  Is there another app to replace this?  I tried phone+ but it was full of ads etc so I didn't like that.    Just an FYI its an iPhone6s+, with the latest build of iOS.  Just did all the updates last night...  <comment292839> tbh, I'd just use Siri... "Ring Marcus, cellphone" [or mobile, whichever term is used where you live] <comment292841> Aside from Siri, because the names of my contacts are sometimes hard to pronounce.  Is there any recommended apps to replace the default phone app?  I guess coming from a google phone it would seem this is quite basic functionality.  If you type a number (which represents a letter) it should come up with matches to both.  Why would apple skip out on this? <comment292843> It sounds interesting, if a bit outmoded. It's not a function I would have ever thought of these days, tbh. I don't even know where the letters used to be on an old-style mobile. Sorry I can't help. You can train Siri to recognise hard-to-pronounce names, btw. See http://www.guidingtech.com/52080/siri-pronounces-name-correctly/ <comment293053> I tried a ton of apps but none of them support missed calls or calls made to me, they only show you recently dialed.  In fact many of the apps explicitly tell you that.  It's almost like they do not have access to the data.  I guess I'll keep the stock apple phone app but I still really think such features should be implemented in the stock app.
