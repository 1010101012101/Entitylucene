ssh under tmux always asks for password <body> Normally I give my passphrase for the private key on the first codessh/code invocation and then I am not asked for the passphrase (in this and all other bash sessions).  However, under codetmux/code, I am asked for the passphrase over and over even in the same codebash/code (same codetmux/code pane).  I think the problem originated with the Sierra.  strongHow do I avoid having to enter my passphrase repeatedly under codetmux/code?/strong  PS. codessh-add -l/code prints codeThe agent has no identities./code both with and without codetmux/code.  PPS. code$SSH_AUTH_SOCK/code names an existing socket under code/private/tmp.../code.  <answer257287> Open a new terminal window and run the following commands:  precode$ tmux new -s temp $ ssh-agent $ ssh-add /code/pre  That seems to have fixed the issue for me; new tmux sessions now no longer ask me for my ssh key passphrase.  <comment320889> Do you see the key in the `ssh-add -l` output? If not, the key is not in keyring or the `tmux` does not see the keyring (for some reason). <comment320905> @Jakuje: `ssh-add -l` prints `The agent has no identities.` both with and without `tmux`.  but without `tmux` I am not asked for password! <comment321207> yes, of course that works. the question is why this was not necessary before. <comment325157> I have the same issue. I also notice that enabling agent forwarding will set `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` on the first remote machine but will not forward credentials properly. <comment341218> @sds it looks like your question was actually how to avoid it - soooo your question was answered. And helped me too. :thumbs_up:
