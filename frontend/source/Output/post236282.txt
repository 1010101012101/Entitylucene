How to disable LoginWindow (boot to Darwin console)? <body> This may seem like an odd question, but it's one I've been wondering for quite a while. There is an old trick to get access to a console by typing code&gt;console/code as the username in the login window. However, since 10.7 (I think) this feature has been broken, and the console will become unusable after a few minutes. Which makes me wonder - is there any way to more permanently enable a text-mode login?  I'm looking for some way to preferably disable, but otherwise delete, LoginWindow's graphical functionality. I'm not sure if this is even possible, but any help would be appreciated.
