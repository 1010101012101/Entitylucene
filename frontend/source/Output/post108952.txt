White streaks (image retention) on the sides of iPhone 5S screen? <body> Not sure why this happened, but I had a conversation for 50 minutes and then realised some weird white streaks on the screen after I hung up. The streaks are now stronggone/strong (gladly), it seems like the screen was overheating or something ??   What is the cause of this anomaly ?  strongEDIT/strong  This seems to happen every time I make a phone call ! The white streaks appear and start fading over time. Am I the only one with this problem ?  **EDIT 2 **  Still have this problem but no permanent marks as of now. It's just a weird phenomenon that happens every time I receive a call.  hr  Example of this (recreation) :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rRvil.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment130557> Try this image retention test: http://www.marco.org/rmbp-irtest.html <comment130576> @Flavin What is that supposed to do ? <comment130596> It is a test for image retention. You leave the checkerboard pattern up for some time, then flip to gray. If your screen has image retention problems, there will be a remnant of the checkerboard pattern visible on the gray screen. (Make sure you don't stare at the checkerboard, though, because your eyes certainly have an image retention problem.) <comment132193> @Flavin Thank you but I already know I have the problem, as described by the problem above.
