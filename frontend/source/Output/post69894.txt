Activate passcode lock after 30 mins of inactivity? <body> I have a jailbroken iPhone 4S. The current time options for a passcode lock are:  ul liImmediately/li liAfter 1, 5, or 15 minutes/li liAfter 1 or 4 hours/li /ul  However I would prefer using 30 mins or 45 mins, something in between. Is there a Cydia app that allows me to modify this?  emEDIT/em  Still cannot find a feature, anyone knows any possible solution ?  <answer155579> There is a jailbreak tweak called PassTime which lets you set custom time option for activating passcode lock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKMMt.png" alt="enter image description here"  PassTime is available for strong$0.99/strong under the BigBoss repo on Cydia.  <comment85134> Did you find anything out here? <comment85135> Still waiting ... I really want such feature.
