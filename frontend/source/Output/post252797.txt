Can I remove a photo or video from the Memories feature in iOS 10's photo app? <body> I love the new memories feature in iOS 10 but sometimes it grabs less than great photos. Can I remove those photos just from the memory?  <answer252798> Yes, tap the edit button in the lower right corner than select the 'Photos &amp; Videos" item to remove or add media to a memory. It is also broken out on MacRumor's guide.
