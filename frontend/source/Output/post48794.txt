How do i turn off email notifications on my laptop? <body> I keep getting email's notifying me of my upcoming meetings. This would be fine, but i never asked it to do this.   I use Gmail for email and Google Calendar for my scheduling. On my laptop Mail.app and iCal emare/em linked to my Google account although I never use either of them.   Can someone point me in the right direction for turning email notifications off?   <answer48799> ol lisign in to google calendar at http://google.com/calendar/li liClick on the 'gear' icon at the top right and choose 'Calendar Settings'/li liClick on 'Calendars' /li liClick on 'Notifications' for the appropriate calendar/li lilook for 'Event reminders' and remove the 'By default, remind me via [Email]' entry/li /ol  <answer59434> The answer on this page might help, especially the 4th suggestion: http://www.quora.com/OS-X-10-8-Mountain-Lion/Is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-OS-X-Mail-app-to-fire-up-and-send-Calendar-notifications  <comment55869> thanks, i went in there and it the checkbox was already unchecked.. is it possible that Mail.App is doing it on its own, ignoring the Google settings? <comment55972> Not likely. I would open up iCal and see what's going on. If you have used BusyCal, I would also open that up too. <comment76947> Welcome to Ask Different!
