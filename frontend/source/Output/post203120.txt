Cleaning save as dialogue <body> I've been searching the last couple of days for a way to clean up the save as dialogue box. More importantly the favorites portion. There are a bunch of dmg files that are no longer mounted and should not be there. They do not show up in finder only when I try to save a file.   So far I tried resetting finder, cleaning with ccleaner and scoured through plist with Pref Setter application, to no avail. I have attached a screen shot of what I'm trying to clean.  Thank you in advance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UbMKq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer203162> These items are defined in the side bar in your finder. Open a new Finder and make sure the Sidebar is shown (if not, go to strongView/strong menu and select strongShow Sidebar/strong) and you should see the same items listed there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hpldh.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can right click on any of those items and select strongRemove from Sidebar/strong. That should do the trick.  <comment245012> Do you only see this in your browser? <comment245131> I should have posted that picture too. but its clean there as well. <comment245133> the list shows up on all application not just the browser.
