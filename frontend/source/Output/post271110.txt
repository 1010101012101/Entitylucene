How to install a free app that is available in the Taiwan iTunes store? <body> I have a USA iTunes account, and Hong Kong iTunes account, but that's because I have a USA issued credit card (for the USA store), and I could buy Hong Kong iTunes card for HK$500 and then use it for my Hong Kong iTunes account.  But for Taiwan, I do not have a Taiwan issued credit card, and it didn't work if I enter a USA issued credit card for a Taiwan account (or if I switch store to Taiwan store). Plus, there is no iTunes card for Taiwan. (Apple doesn't produce them at all, so I can't even buy it in Taiwan or on eBay).  So it seemed I would be stuck if want to set up account as Taiwan store, or "Change Store" to Taiwan, because no valid Taiwan issued credit card and no Taiwan iTunes card.  And now I just need to install an app that is only available in the Taiwan iTunes store (or App store).  And the app is strongemfree/em/strong.  Is there a possible way at all to do it?
