How to download the .mov for later viewing? <body> I would like to download the keynote speech on  http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1103pijanbdvaaj/event/index.html  so that when Apple remove the video later, I can still watch it later... but there seems to be no easy way, except if I buy the Pro version of QuickTime?  some meta file shows these addresses, but the first one will save as a 1k file to show the second address, and the second one can't be saved because it is coderstp:///code not codehttp:///code:  http://stream.qtv.apple.com/events/mar/1103pijanbdvaaj/1103pijnpfvrbfvijbavojh_hd_ref.mov  rtsp://a2047.v1414b.c1414.g.vq.akamaistream.net/5/2047/1414/1_h264_1000/1a1a1ae757c733980368e14fbe3297c529980f7de958b91d4bac1778e546afdd40af1c4b7cb0e115/1103pijnpfvrbfvijbavojh_1_hd.mov  Someone mentioned using Ubuntu Linux's Movie player to download it but it seems there is no save option?  <answer12099> Usually, Apple put it's keynotes in iTunes Podcasts, where you can download them.  Look for strongApple Keynote/strong and download the ones you want.  Just note that there might be delay, often less than a week, before they released the latest keynote.  <comment12612> I see... trying now... although, would like to also be able to download the ones on web... say, if the one on web has a higher resolution or if it is on web but not on else where... <comment12912> this one can be download from iTunes, yes, but would be nice if it can be downloaded from the web as well
