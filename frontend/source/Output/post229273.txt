Applescript claims to run shell script, but script has no effect <body> So I have a bash script like this:  precode#!/bin/sh  FILE='some_file.js' gsed -i -E 's/something/somethingelse/' "$FILE" echo "Modified File" /code/pre  When I run this from command line, it echoes the last line, so no errors or something and makes changes to the file. I then try to create an Applescript with these contents:  precodeset msg to do shell script "/path/to/script.sh" display dialog msg /code/pre  When I run it, it dutifully displays the dialog, but does not actually change the file codesome_file.js/code. How can this be possible?  strongUpdate/strong: If I use codesed -i "" -E 's/something/somethingelse/' "$FILE"/code instead, it works.  <comment279675> Where is gsed? Reading more I'll bet not on the path. Altering ~/.bash( files will not chnage this - I would use the full path to gsed <comment279680> @Mark Oh it's in the `PATH` alright. It's installed via macports. But setting the full path does help. I thought I would be alerted with an error message (as I have seen before) that the command was not found, but apparently the applescript just silently fails. <comment279681> Do you capture stderr? How did yeast the PATH? <comment279691> PATH als seen in Terminal may not be the same as PATH in Automator, so it's best to add the full path to non-standard commands.
