Mac App Store update stuck (Installing - Calculating...) <body> I opened GarageBand for the first time, to find that most of the loops required me to download the Apple Loops from Software Update. I agreed to this.  The App Store opened and gave me the option to install the update from Updates - I clicked Install and waited for the download to complete. It did, and then the installation began.  About half an hour later, the update is stuck on (Installing - Calculating...) This doesn't seem normal - the last time I installed the Loops, they were done in about ten minutes.  Force quitting and re-opening the App Store doesn't help, nor does a reboot. When I open the App Store, the update is still at the same process.  Is there anything that I could do to get the update to finish installing?  Here is a screenshot of the App Store in this state: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tE6b6.png" alt="The App Store in the state that I have described."  <answer82553> Try deleting the cache located here:  precode~/Library/Caches/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate/ /code/pre  And the prefrences plist, here:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist /code/pre  And start the application again. It should have flushed whatever updates that got stuck.  <answer82556> In an act of desperation, I managed to fix the issue by:  ul liDeleting /Library/Updates/li liDoing   precodesudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist RecommendedUpdates sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist DidRegisterLocalUpdates /code/pre  in a Terminal session/li liRestarting the Mac/li /ul  The update is re-downloading now.  Interestingly, before I tested these steps, I found the update ready to install in /Library/Updates, however when I tried to install the PKG file, Installer claimed that another installation needed to finish (?). Deleting it and restarting fixed the problem.  <answer90844> Related to Emil's answer, I just wanted to add that I had a similar problem updating xcode. Simply clearing the cache and restarting App Store worked for me.   precoderm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate/ /code/pre  <answer197784> Had a very similar problem to this - updates stuck on the 'Checking for Updates' spinning icon.  Reboot failed to fix problem.  Because I am a newbie, much of what was said above seemed difficult, so I thought I'd just try the one thing I could actually find on my machine, which was to delete:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.pIist.plist /code/pre  This step alone seemed to fix things for me.  <answer208318> just go to store option and click on reload page  <answer248231> This happened to me after updating to the Developer beta of macOS Sierra. For me, the following solution helped.  Delete the downloaded updates:  precodesudo rm /Library/Updates /code/pre  Kill the software update daemon:  precodesudo killall -9 softwareupdated /code/pre  An additional note to analyze AppStore / codesoftwareupdate/code problems is probably using the Console app or codetail/code to have a look at code/var/log/install.log/code.  <answer248580> This trick solved my problem.  hr  This happened to me after updating to the Developer beta of macOS Sierra.

I deleted the Caches file (and /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate since there wasn't one in ~/Library/Preferences) and opened MAS. However, when I clicked Update, the update restarted again from Installing - Calculating. <comment231515> Simply deleting /Library/Updates & restarting worked for me <comment314445> For me, removing ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore/ worked. <comment348758> This is the same as previous answers and should've probably just been a comment to the other answer(s) and not an answer by itself. <comment348779> This and sudo killall -9 softwareupdated worked for me. <comment348856> No it isn't -- all the other answers involve going into the Terminal to run commands.  This solution just involves opening Activity Monitor.  The outcome is the same but it's a more accessible way to do it for most users. <comment348858> It's the same answer with a different way of doing it.  This should've been a comment or edit to the existing answers, not a new answer. <comment356625> Four years after this Question was first posted, and the problem still exists in the latest OS X.  Is Apple not listening ?
