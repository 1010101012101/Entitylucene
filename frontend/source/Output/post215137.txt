Problems with installing Xcode on Mac 10.10.5 ( Locations - setting) <body> I have followed the steps for the installation from www.instalrails.com .  After installing Xcode they say to check the Preferences - Location  and have ensure you have the command line tools - Xcode 5.0.2 ( 5A3005 ) http://installrails.com/steps/install_xcode  But in my command line tools emXcode 7.1.1 (7B1005)/em appears and I cannot modify it.  I left it as it is and then tried to write this simple command in Terminal and it does not work :  precode$ jot - 1 25 /code/pre  It says command not found.  Can you please give some directions.  <answer215145> The linked picture in the install guide  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3sgnc.png" alt="enter image description here"  is simply wrong. After installing the latest Xcode 7.1.1 the command line tools version is indeed Xcode 7.1.1 (7B1005).  emjot/em is an executable (it prints sequential or random data) residing in /usr/bin. The purpose of executing codejot - 1 25/code is to ensure that the $PATH variable is set properly in your environment. If it can't be executed your $PATH variable probably doesn't include /usr/bin.  To get your current $PATH variable enter codeecho $PATH/code. The default $PATH in Yosemite looks like this:  precode/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  To restore the proper $PATH variable use one of the various answers here at apple.stackexchange.com.  <comment259890> Thank you so much!. P.s I have tried         jot - 1 25   whiteout the $ and it works. also echo $PATH works. <comment259893> Last login: Wed Nov 11 00:28:47 on ttys000 MacBook-Air-ul-lui-Eduard:~ prime_user$ echo $PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin MacBook-Air-ul-lui-Eduard:~ prime_user$ q -bash: q: command not found MacBook-Air-ul-lui-Eduard:~ prime_user$ jot 1 125 125 MacBook-Air-ul-lui-Eduard:~ prime_user$ $ jot - 1 25 -bash: $: command not found MacBook-Air-ul-lui-Eduard:~ prime_user$  jot - 1 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 <comment259894> @EduardPetru Ok it was simple mistake <comment259895> Thank you, I am at the very beginning, a lot learn but there is passion :-D
