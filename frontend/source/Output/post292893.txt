MacBook won't make any noise except for startup chime, works perfectly otherwise <body> My MacBook Pro-2015 (13" retina) won't make any noise except for startup chime, but it works perfectly fine otherwise. Any solutions To restore full sound are appreciated.  <comment369534> What have you tried? System prefs? Muted? Hard to troubleshoot with such limited information. Cheers <comment369535> Have you tried resetting PRAM/SMC? <comment369543> I'd try checking System Preferences. Make sure your output is speakers, not something else. If you have installed Soundflower on your laptop, this may be causing the problem. If this doesn't work, try resetting the NVRAM.
