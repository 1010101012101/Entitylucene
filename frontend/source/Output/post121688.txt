Attaching files and not wanting them embedded into email body <body> Company Director with a MacBook Air and she's having problems attaching pages files and PDF's to her e-mails. Mail keep embedding them into the message window so she cannot type, or see what she's typed in the window. Many times recipients of her messages say they are missing some of the attachments she thinks she has attached.  How can I turn off the embedding of any attachments into the message body and just displaying them as a 'file' icon somewhere rather than the contents?  <answer121689> Using the strongTerminal.app/strong you can set a default to turn off inline previews of attached files. The command to issue is:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes /code/pre  You only need to issue this command once per user. Be sure to quit Mail.app first and relaunch Mail.app afterwards; otherwise the changed default may not be seen.  <comment141874> You can turn off the inline preview; this should help reduce the confusion http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24569/turn-off-automatic-preview-in-apple-mail <comment141875> Will try this shortly, thanks Graham! <comment141886> Also - I'm not 100% sure this is duplicate so rather than asking a new question, consider editing this if it's not actually a duplicate. <comment142027> You're right bmike, I will update accept and correct when I have a chance to try things.
