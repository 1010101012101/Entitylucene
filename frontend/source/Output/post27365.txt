AirPlay working with iPad but rarely with iTunes on my mac? <body> I don't get why, when I play music with AirPlay from my iPad it always work, but with iTunes on my mac it rarely work. It says after 10 seconds:  precodeThe AirPlay device “My Airport Express” cannot be found on your network.  /code/pre  The iPad works perfectly instead.  It worked also on the mac few times (so it should be correctly configured).  thanks  <comment31426> I suddenly (like in the last month or so) am seeing the exact same issue. <comment34974> Have you disabled IPv6 on the Mac or turned on / installed any firewall software?
