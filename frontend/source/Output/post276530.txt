Why was my 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard illuminated when I woke up? <body> MBP wasn't plugged into anything and isn't scheduled to wake up, the laptop was flipped in the open position all night. When I glanced at it at ~8am the keyboard was illuminated. I didn't touch it.  Did the camera sense movement which caused the laptop to wake up?  <comment348121> It's probably a bug with the new hardware. Mine's keyboards sometimes is kept lit even when the lid is closed. <comment348234> @TomShen thanks!
