Trace/BPT trap: 5 and Gnuplot/Text Edit, ... on Mavericks <body> I need to use gnuplot and a bunch of other stuff, so I installed MacPorts on Mavericks. After installing the packages, if I try to plot something I get the codeTrace/BPT trap: 5/code error. Reinstalling XQuartz didn't fix the problem. Do you know how could I fix this? I tried various methods suggested online but nothing worked. Thanks!  <comment141717> Could you expand on what 'various methods' you did? <comment141719> I reinstalled MacPorts and Homebrew, I reinstalled XQuartz and I checked if there was something strange in .bash_profile
