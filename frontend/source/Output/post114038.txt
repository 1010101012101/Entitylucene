How can I disable App Store update notification for non-admin users? <body> I am admin on my MBA (Mavericks), and I want to get App Store update notifications. The rest of my family have non-admin (standard) accounts and I'd like to disable App Store updates and notification for their logins.  The answers to Disable App Update Notifications on OSX? apply to all users, not selective users.  <answer116910> There's no way to do this without sticking some funky commands in the command line. Best option is to just disable the update notifications system-wide (such as suggested in your article/link) and have the admin users check for updates manually.  <comment161208> I agree that's not feasible, but "some funky commands in the command line" - that's kind of implying that *there is a solution*, isn't it? ;-)
