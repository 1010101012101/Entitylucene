Missing "show package contents" cmd <body> I was trying to extract the contents of a code.pkg/code file, and right clicking on it should usually allow the context sensitive codeShow Package Contents/code option.  However, it does not seem to show on any .pkg file I can find on my system.  I have since expanded the contents on the command line using this command:  precodeStuffeMac:Desktop stuffe$ pkgutil --expand AirPortUtility56.pkg ./dan2/ /code/pre  Which worked fine, and inside this package was another code.pkg/code file.  Right clicking on this and codeShow Package Contents/code is back again, but only for the one I just expanded...  What's going on?  <answer114199> emShow Package Contents/em is not for showing the contents of .pkg files, it's for showing the hidden structure for Applications (and other bundles), which are actually folders. You can use the program Pacifist to look at the contents of .pkg files.  To answer the question in your comment, here's how you can tell in Terminal. When you perform an codels -l/code command, directories have emd/em as the first character in the line.  precode516 $ ls -l drwxr-xr-x    3 steve  admin         102 Jan  6  2011 Form Viewer.app drwxrwxrwx@   3 root   admin         102 Jan 18  2010 FormViewerFonts.pkg -rw-r--r--@   1 steve  staff  2157020198 Jun 30  2012 MacTeX-2012.pkg /code/pre  In this example, the first two entries are bundles and the last isn't.  <comment133859> Is there some way of telling if a file ending in `.pkg` is actually a bundle or something else?  In this instance both the original file and the contents of that file were `.pkg` files <comment133860> If it's a bundle, *Show Package Contents* will show up in the context menu. If not, it won't. You can also look at it in Terminal. A bundle's structure isn't hidden there. If it's a bundle it shows up as a directory. <comment133863> I added a Terminal example to my answer. <comment351155> Any idea what makes a directory show as a package as opposed to as a regular directory? <comment351185> @DanRosenstark Nope. You should post that as a question so we can both find out. <comment351188> Will do, thanks! <comment352508> Not my best question-asking, but anyway: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/280280/what-makes-an-osx-package-show-as-a-package
