Swipe settings in El Capitan Mail.app <body> This is a different question from this.  Is anybody able to develop a Terminal command that will change the behaviour of swipe settings in Mail?   By default strongswipe right/strong is 'Mark as Unread/Read' while strongswipe left/strong is 'Trash'.  The Preferences setting is only able to change the strongswipe left/strong gesture to 'Archive' instead of 'Trash'. However no such customisation is provided for the strongswipe right/strong gesture.  I want to be able to strongswipe right/strong to Archive; it feels more natural and moreover this is the setting on my iPhone as well.  <answer220126> I'm going to go out on a limb and say there is no hidden setting to do this.   I tried making a new user account and switching the primary language to Arabic - so that the text and mail panes are laid out right-to-left instead of left-to-right and the swipe gesture is still:  ul liswipe to right marks as unread/read/li liswipe to left is trash/li /ul  My thinking is that if there was an allowance for differing behavior, Apple would have implemented that change in the swipe for languages with right-to-left text flow direction.  I could be wrong and hope someone posts a better answer if I am actually wrong in my guess. My thinking is you'd want to file a bug report to ask for the change if you don't think Apple will re-evaluate this design choice on their own accord.  <comment311618> [Airmail 3](http://airmailapp.com/features) has the capability to customize all swipes to whatever you want from a larger list of options. I realize this doesn't answer your exact question but it's an alternative.
