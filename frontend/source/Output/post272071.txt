Why does my search and replace perl work in terminal but not in automator? <body> I am building a database with several thousand entries, each represented as a unique text file. I managed to find and replace specific tags in all text files in a desired folder using the terminal app:  precodeperl -i -pe 's/&lt;d:index d:value=””\/&gt;//g' *.txt  perl -i -pe 's/&lt;d:index d:value=”Творительный”\/&gt;//g' *.txt /code/pre  Now I have plenty of more tags to remove and want to use Automator for this purpose. It is not an option to replace emТворительный/em (as in example) with nothing. This will mess up the content for me. When I run the first script above in Automator it works and the empty tag is removed from the batch of text files. But when I run the second script Automator makes no change to the text files (and there is no error message). I have emcode/bin/bash/code/em and emcodeas argument/code/em selected in the drop down menus and I pasted the perl as such:  precodecd $1 perl -i -pe 's/&lt;d:index d:value=”Творительный”\/&gt;//g' *.txt /code/pre  strongQ: Why is it that the first perl works in Automator and the second does not?/strong  <comment341970> I noticed that in your `perl` _command_ you're using _curly-quotes_ (a.k.a _smart-quotes_ ) `”` not _straight-quotes_ `"` as it probably really should be. Can you edit you question to include a sample of the contents of the files you're trying to modify and the complete workflow of your Automator workflow and what type of workflow is it? Otherwise it's to hard to test when not having all the variables of an issue defined.
