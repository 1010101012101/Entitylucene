Can't compress with system integrity protection enabled <body> I am dealing with a user running with El Capitan who was encountering a peculiar error message when compressing files from Finder:  precodeThe contents list canâ€™t be created for compressing /code/pre  A peculiar error message.  There was a blog post that suggested deleting and recreating /tmp, but I was hesitant to do so without further investigation, especially since the permissions appeared to me that they were correct at first glance.  However, the user was turning off System Integrity Protection for an unrelated issue with Fireworks, and as it turns out, turning that off allows them to compress files again from the Finder.  What's going on here?  Is there a way to turn SIP back on while keeping her ability to compress files?  <comment323232> What are they trying to compress? i.e. is it possibly a folder protected by SIP? <comment323270> Even if it's a directory protected by SIP, that shouldn't stop Archive Utility from being able to read its contents and compress it. Could be that the destination is also protected by SIP. By default, finder creates the zip in the same directory as the directory being compressed.
