Profile Manager date format <body> Can the date format used by Profile Manager be changed?  In the host OSX System Preferences control panel, the region is set to Australia and gives the example date of 5/01/2015 for the 5th of January. However the Profile Manager web interface uses US date format such as 01/05/2015.  Is there a way to set Profile Manager to use a more appropriate date format?
