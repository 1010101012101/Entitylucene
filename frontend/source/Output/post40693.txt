Is there a shortcut to open a folder in a Open File dialog? <body> In an Open File dialog, I can press Return or Cmd-Down to go eminto/em a folder. But is there a key sequence to actually select the folder as the item to open? It seems I can only just use the mouse to press the Open button while the folder is highlighted.  (BBEdit is an example of an application in which I often want to open a folder.)  <answer40699> Not all applications allow you to open multiple documents simultaneously but you can open an entire folder from a BBedit (Version 10.0.1) Open Dialog by using the emColumn view/em, selecting the folder you want to open, and hitting kbdreturn/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b61NS.png" alt="image of BBEdit Open Dialog Box"  <answer40702> codeReturn/code (with the ↩ symbol) emopens/em the folder for browsing its contents (unless you're in column view). You need to press codeEnter/code instead. It's a different key, and its symbol is ⌤.  If you don't have that key on your keyboard, you can press codeFn-Return/code to achieve the same effect.  <comment46069> Thanks for the clarification. I so seldom use anything *but* column view that I was unaware of the distinction. You have my vote sir.
