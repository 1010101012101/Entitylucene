Mail App Open wrong attach in iOS 5.1.1 iPad 2 <body> In my inbox there are two different email with an attachment with the same name, i.e. "my document.pdf", but different contents.  The problem is that, when I open a such email, the attachment displayed doesn't change! It's seems that the Mail App is caching the first attachment and reuse it every time an attachment has the same name.  Step to reproduce my problem:  ol liTake two different .pdf documents and rename both with the same name, "test.pdf"/li liCreate two different email and put one of the documents in each./li liSend and try to read both emails. In my case, depending on the order, every mail displays the same attach!/li /ol  Anyone else has the same problem, and is there any solution?   My workaround is to clear the Safari cache, delete the account and recreate it. Very annoying.
