Why does the kernel fail to sent back TCP ACK package (El Capitan) ? <body> On macosx el capitan (10.11.6) when trying to expose a webserver (codepython -m SimpleHTTPServer/code) to computer ons the network the incoming connection fails. The issue only occurs when the server in accessed from a remote machine, meaning that calling wget/telnet on any of the interfaces of the machines gets a result.  I did a tcpdump while trying to call the server from the remote machine and I get the following output :   code09:15:05.754761 IP 12.0.0.32.46092 &gt; 12.0.0.47.8000: Flags [S], seq 3637243186, win 14600, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 714418 ecr 0,nop,wscale 6], length 0/code  This led me to belive  that this might be a firewall issue so I checked that it is disabled from system settings. Unfortunately  the issue still persists with the firewall disabled.  Another strange thing is that I have remote SSH enabled and when connecting from a remote machine via ssh works, from the tcpdump I can see that the tcp handshake is made (an ACK packet is sent to the client)  Did anyone experience this type of issue ?   <comment343842> The issue is very similar  to the one described by http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/81421/mac-os-x-server-ignores-remote-http-connections-but-accepts-local-ones. The only difference is that I don't have ipfw installed on my machine.
