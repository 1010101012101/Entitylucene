How to view recent edits in TextWrangler <body> I have checked the help but can't find any information on this.br What I would like to do is to have recent edits highlighted embefore/em I save a document. The "undo" function evidently tracks these changes and it would be nice to be able to quickly run through them before saving, just in case anything unfortunate has happened, such as erasing a large chunk of code.br Does anyone know if this is even possible in TextWrangler?  <comment230100> Have you looked in TextWrangler Help or read the User Manual? <comment230686> Yes, _"I have checked the help but can't find any information on this."_
