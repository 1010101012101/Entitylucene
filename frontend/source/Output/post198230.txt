Can't enable Java for browser <body> For some reason, whenever I try to enable Java in the browser by clicking on the checkbox "Enable Java content in browser" in the Security tab of the Java control panel, it asks for my password and then promptly unselects my selection.  Does anyone know what is happening?  I have OSX 10.10.4. I've also uninstalled and reinstalled the Oracle JRE to no avail.  Thanks  <answer198731> I've got the same issue. Here's how I resolved it using Terminal commands:  ol liMake yourself to root  codesudo su -/code/li liRemove the existing JAVA Runtime (JRE) as well as JDK if any  coderm -R /Library/Application\ Support/Oracle//code  coderm -R /Library/Oracle//code  coderm -R /Library/Java//code  coderm -R /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin//code  coderm -R ~/Library/Application\ Support/Oracle//code/li liDownload and install the latest JAVA versions from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. You probably need the JRE only. In case local java software stopped working you'd need the JDK too./li liOpen the System Preferences of OS X, click on JAVA - Security and activate "Enable Java content in browser"/li /ol  The setting that prevented you from enabling Java content in your browser most probably is in /Library/Application\ Support/Oracle/.  <comment237355> I thought Apple made Java built-in for web browsing <comment237375> Yeah, but I thought the Oracle one was supposed to work for that as well?
