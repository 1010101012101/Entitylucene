Terminal not recognizing imacro:// as protocol, thinks it's a pathname <body> I'm trying to run this from the terminal:  precodeopen /Applications/Firefox.app imacros://run/?m=macro.iim /code/pre  This gives me the error  precodeThe file /Users/dave/Desktop/watch-nodejs/imacros:/run/?m=macro.iim does not exist. /code/pre  The expected result is to open firefox and type "imacros://run/?m=macro.iim" in the url bar. This works on mac and windows, but for some reason mac thinks "imacros://run/?m=macro.iim" is a path to a file on my computer  <answer295062> Use  precodeopen /Applications/Firefox.app --args 'imacros://run/?m=macro.iim' /code/pre  to prevent codeopen/code from messing with the argument. Also quoting might help to stop the shell from stumbling over any special characters (not really required in this specific case).  <comment372436> It is not open messing with the arguments surely it is just passing the second string (imacro...)  to open and not to Firefox
