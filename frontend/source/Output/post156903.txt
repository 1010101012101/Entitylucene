Having trouble mounting a 12TB Raid on Ubuntu Server <body> I am running a Ubuntu server on my off of my 2008 MacPro, it runs great and works really well except I am not able to run any raid setups directly on it.  I have a large library that needs to be accessable from the web on my 12TB raid running raid 5...right now the drive is formatted as HFS+, however I can change the format to anything as long as it mounts to a MAC as Read Write.  At this point I have not been able to successfully mount the drive and was turning here for help.  I have tried so many solutions that it would probably be counter intuitive to mention all the methods I have tried so lets just imagine we are started from scratch.  Everything is up to date on Ubuntu.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <comment184504> Internal or external RAID? If external, how is it attached? FiberChannel? <comment184505> Sorry good question, it is an external RAID attached via Firewire 800 <comment184506> and what type/model of external enclosure? "soft-raid"? <comment184508> It is a G-Speed Q Raid http://www.g-technology.com/products/g-speed-q-4-bay-raid-16-tb  Again 12 TB Running Raid 5 which makes 8TB Usable <comment184512> did you check the answer at [superuser](http://superuser.com/questions/84446/how-to-mount-a-hfs-partition-in-ubuntu-as-read-write) especially answer Jan 31 '11 at 19:48 Steve Alfano? <comment184517> Yes, this is my command `sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/sbd1 /var/www/html/archive` and I get this error `mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,        missing codepage or helper program, or other error        In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try        dmesg | tail  or so`  I have confirmed that this is hfs+ several times  It should be noted that at this point as long as it mounts I am okay with Read-Access only, although I believe Journaling is turned off
