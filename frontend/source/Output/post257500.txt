Should I buy DDR3 or DDR3L RAM for late 2012 MacBook pro 13 inch? <body> I have a MacBook Pro 13", late 2012 model.  This MacBook has 2x2gb 1600MHz DDR3 RAM. I am planning to upgrade it to 8GB of RAM.  I am wondering, should I buy DDR3 or DDR3L type of RAM?  <answer257511> Apple has a RAM upgrade guide located here. For your computer(MBP 13" mid-2012),  it provides this information:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i3akZ.jpg" alt="RAM info"  <comment321555> Note that while this computer only officially supports 8GB of RAM, Other World Computing (www.macsales.com) suggests that up to 16 GB of RAM can be installed without problems. <comment321558> I already checked it out.  I wanted to know whether i can put a ddr3l ram in it? <comment321562> Yes you can, theoretically, but I don't know why you would. Apple doesn't officially support it, but theoretically ddr3l is backwards compatible with ddr3.
