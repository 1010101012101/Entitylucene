Receive StackExchange notifications <body> Is there a way to receive notifications from StackExchange sites in the Notification Center in OSX?  <answer131967> Any app can send notifications in Notification Center, though I'm not sure Stack Exchange has an OS X app to send notifications from, Apple's Mail.app can do it. Go into System Preferences, and to the Notification Center Preference Pane located in the Personal section, and add Mail to the Notification Center. Now, whenever you receive a notification from Stack Exchange via email, you will be notified in Notification Center.  <answer131983> I'm not sure why MacLemon didn't post SENotifier as a proper answer, but that's your best choice right now. Version 1.1 added the ability to send notifications about your Stack Exchange to Notification Centre.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yDLbK.png" alt="enter image description here"     SENotifier is a Mac OS X app that shows the current contents of your   Stack Exchange inbox in the menu bar and was inspired by Gmail   Notifier.      I created this app so the inbox notifier would be visible all the   time, instead of only when a Stack Exchange page was loaded in the   browser.      This app uses the new Stack Exchange API v2.0 with authentication, so   it can get the current contents of your inbox.   <comment154891> -1 for posting this in AskDifferent.
