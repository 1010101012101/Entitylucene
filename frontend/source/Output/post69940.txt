Office for Mac Excel app doesn't show thousand separator <body> I'm using OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2, with Microsoft Office 14.2.4.  strongProblem:/strong Ever since I installed new updates of OS X, Excel can no longer display the thousands separator.  How can I get it back?  <answer72304> A temporary workaround is always simply kbdCommand/kbd-kbdA/kbd to select all cells and clicking this convenient button in the ribbon under the Home tab in the Number section:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWOwo.png" alt="enter image description here"  A more permanent solution is as follows:  Go into System Preferences  Language and Text and click the "Region" tab.  If the first region dropdown menu is United States (Computer), this might be your problem.  Looking below shows that this region formats numbers without a thousands separator.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8s8c.png" alt="enter image description here"  This appears to be the result, as you stated, of an OS X update. Instead, set the Region to United States (without the Computer part).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3ykT.png" alt="enter image description here"  From the Excel Help window:     h3Display or hide the thousands separator/h3      Select the cells that you want to adjust. On the Home tab, under   Number, click Display the value of a cell with a thousands separator.      Note: strongExcel uses the Mac OS system separator for thousands. You can   specify a different system separator by emchanging the regional settings   in Mac OS X International system preferences./em/strong   We have just done that, but it appears that Excel continues to ignore the change.  Re-install Office and update us with the results.  <answer117613> Formatting palette Number Custom Edit format of the prototype number (I removed the dollar sign, but kept the commas)  I have Mountain Lion and Excel 2008 for mac  <answer154915> Setting the System Region Setting from 'United States (Computer)' to 'United States' worked for me!  Running Mavericks 10.9.5 and Office 14.4.5.  <answer247666> I got the same problem and just applied the solution recommended, to change the region from US Computer to US, and know what? It worked! thanks a lot. Btw, don't forget to close Excel and open it again to see the result. Thanks again. Marco  <comment81226> Are you asking how to get it back, or just making the general observation? <comment81237> I want to get it back <comment83965> The link to your video seems to have gone dead, maybe you can list out the steps to reproduce? I've tried using the same version of Excel, but on 10.7.5 and I can get a thousands separator the normal way, but going to cell format, selecting the number type and checking the box for thousands separator. <comment84262> look like you using a different version of excel. mine is 14.2.4 <comment84263> @robmathers reuploaded the video <comment84273> @runrunforest which screenshot are you referring to? mine is 14.2.5 - can't be too different as they're both from the 2011 suite. <comment84300> @runrunforest According to your video, you should have the first screenshot; I saw it in the home tab (it looks like a comma). As for the second and third screenshots, that's in System Preferences under Language and Text. <comment84303> I now i understand. it has nothing to do with excel. the region setting is affecting excel. I changed to your suggestion thing is now back to normal. <comment84311> @runrunforest glad I could help! no rush- but you still have an active bounty. are you looking for anything else, because I can try to address any more questions you may have (about excel, region prefs, etc) <comment84357> it's ok, i got my answeer, thank you <comment108787> As of today May 30,2013, using Excel 2011, and OS X (10.8.3) this solution is NOT working for me. Anyone else? I tried using other regions, custom separators, new files, nothing changes. **No commas**. <comment121947> Rather than re-installing MS Excel, a reboot then applying the comma format seems to be the extra step to get it to work <comment305617> Flagging this to be closed as a 'me too' post and not an answer.
