MacBook retina 12 inch 2015: text garbled on URL bar of safari <body> What can cause this? The URL bar is behaving weirdly and cannot be edited  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uGZO4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210055> I have had the same issue  happen to me, once (I also have the same laptop)....I just rebooted and it never happened again.   I'm unsure if it's even a machine/OS X issue or a scripting error.  Hopefully that solves your same problem.
