Problems with creating Open Directory Replica on OS X Server 5.1 <body> Background:  Two Macs which are running the same Operation System: Mac OS X 10.11.6, OS X Server 5.1.  When I try to set up the second Mac as a replica server, it always shows an error as the following picture:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bYYZT.png" alt="Picture with error"  Then I tried to enter the following command in Terminal from the intended replica server:  precodesudo /usr/sbin/slapconfig -preflightreplica 192.168.8.107 &lt;directoryadminuser&gt;   /code/pre  I always get this error message:     2016-08-13 07:20:58 +0000 NSMutableDictionary *_getRootDSE(const char *): rootDSE not foundbr   2016-08-13 07:20:58 +0000 Error: Unable to determine the master's software version.   Both servers are set to be allowed to remote login via ssh as administrators.  Getting the version returns:   precode$:sudo slapconfig -ver LDAP Setup Tool (slapconfig), Apple, Inc.,  Version 10.11 /code/pre  And I tried all the methods from these addresses, but none of them worked for me:  ul liResolve “rootDSE not found” Error in Open Directory/li liCannot successfully preflight OD replica/li liProblems creating open directory replica on Yosemite Server./li /ul  Anyone can share some advices with me? Really appreciated.  <answer259369> Yes - this worked for me on Sierra with a brand new directory. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204880  <comment309125> Thanks a lot, klanomath.

It's not advisable to provide a link only answer even though it answer the question.  Links go stale, meaning the answer will no longer be useful.  It's best to summarize the answer and provide the link as a citation or for more detail. <comment324588> Thank you, sir. I did try this before, but no luck.
