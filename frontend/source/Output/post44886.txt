Modifying "User interface sound effects" with applescript <body> Good morning all, I would like to be able to turn the system sounds on my mac off (and back on) with an applescript activated as an extension for Alfred.  I have little knowledge of applescripts but I have found that I can open the system preference pane. How do I check and uncheck the "Play user interface sound effects" and "Play feedback when volume is changed" check boxes?br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXYgt.png" alt=""  The start of my code is as follows  precodetell application "System Preferences" to activate (reveal anchor "effects" of pane id "com.apple.preference.sound") /code/pre  Thanks guys  <answer44892> System Preferences and the Sounds prefpane don't have direct ways to script this. But you can use regular UI scripting in AppleScript:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "effects" of pane id "com.apple.preference.sound" end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         if value of theBox is not 1 then             click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1         end if     end tell end tell /code/pre  Or if you want to set a certain value rather than just toggle the checkbox:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "effects" of pane id "com.apple.preference.sound" end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         set theBox to checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1         if value of theBox is not 1 then -- or "is 1"             click theBox         end if     end tell end tell /code/pre  You can also explicitly say codecheckbox "Play user interface sound effects" of .../code instead of just codecheckbox 1/code, but I'm not sure how this behaves with localizations.  <comment51070> Ahh ok, "click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1" is the bit I needed and didn't understand.  Thank you
