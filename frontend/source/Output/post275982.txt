Why are people's names suddenly appearing on my iPhone when receiving a call? <body> Recently when I've received a call from an unknown number, I've started seeing names instead of the number. Additionally, some numbers have appeared as something like codeV34453245235235/code. I've never seen this before a few weeks ago, what's the deal with this?  <comment347254> Who's your carrier???... Caller ID info is first supplied by the carrier, and then may be augmented by what's info can be matched in your contacts.
