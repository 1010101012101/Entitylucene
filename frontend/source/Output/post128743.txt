Terminal Command to Check Available USB Ports <body> I recently took a trip and was utilizing a USB GPS Device push coordinates to a file.  In the middle of the day the device decided to stop working.  We were never able to get it back working again with my machine.  1 of the possible scenarios (aside from hardware failure on the GPS) we have all but ruled out because of an LED indicator.  This leaves me a bit confused.   My question is 2 fold.    1) Is it possible for a device on a MAC to not release a USB port?  2) Is there a way to tell if a USB port is being used at a global system level by any resource?  Can this be done in terminal?  <answer225601> By running  code/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPUSBDataType/code   I get...  precodeUSB:      USB Bus:        Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBUHCIPCI       PCI Device ID: 0x2688       PCI Revision ID: 0x0009       PCI Vendor ID: 0x8086          Generic USB Hub:            Product ID: 0x0008           Vendor ID: 0x04fe  (PFU Limited)           Version: 1.02           Speed: Up to 12 Mb/sec           Manufacturer: Chicony           Location ID: 0x1d100000 / 1           Current Available (mA): 1000           Current Required (mA): 64           Extra Operating Current (mA): 0              PFU-65 USB Keyboard:                Product ID: 0x0006               Vendor ID: 0x04fe  (PFU Limited)               Version: 1.02               Speed: Up to 12 Mb/sec               Manufacturer: Chicony               Location ID: 0x1d110000 / 2               Current Available (mA): 1000               Current Required (mA): 36               Extra Operating Current (mA): 0      USB Bus:        Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBUHCIPCI       PCI Device ID: 0x268b       PCI Revision ID: 0x0009       PCI Vendor ID: 0x8086      USB Bus:        Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBUHCIPCI       PCI Device ID: 0x2689       PCI Revision ID: 0x0009       PCI Vendor ID: 0x8086          USB2.0-Serial:            Product ID: 0x7523           Vendor ID: 0x1a86           Version: 2.54           Speed: Up to 12 Mb/sec           Location ID: 0x3d100000 / 1           Current Available (mA): 1000           Current Required (mA): 96           Extra Operating Current (mA): 0      USB Bus:        Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBUHCIPCI       PCI Device ID: 0x268a       PCI Revision ID: 0x0009       PCI Vendor ID: 0x8086          Bluetooth HCI:            Product ID: 0x8206           Vendor ID: 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.)
