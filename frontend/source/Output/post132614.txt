How do I resync itunes to my music library? <body> I keep my music in an external hard drive which was disconnected while iTunes was on. I reconnected the drive and restarted iTunes but it still can't find the music. Would prefer not to fix manually, there are over 3,000 albums in that directory.  <answer132616> ol liOpen iTunes on your PC/Mac/li liSelect File in the top left corner from the menu bar./li liChoose Add to Libraryâ€¦ and select the missing media./li liYou will be able to see your songs and playlists in the Music section./li /ol  <comment157226> switch to a better music player that doesnt try to manage music for you. itunes will delete files if it doesnt think they should be there <comment157227> Ok, I would switch to a different player in a heartbeat as I absolutely hate iTunes but haven't found anything that will let me manage my ipod. Any suggestions?
