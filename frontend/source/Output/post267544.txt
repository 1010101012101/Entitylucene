Suddenly unable to screenshot- Do not have permission to save files in the location where screenshots are stored <body> Recieved the error:  'Your screenshot could not be saved. You don't have permission to save files in the location where screenshots are stored.' with OS X Yosemite.  I opened terminal and tried directing the screenshots to save on my desktop:  codeBrigittes-Air:~ eggsalad$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture location 2017-01-06 03:04:47.765 defaults[17729:1947540]  The domain/default pair of (com.apple.screencapture, location) does not exist/code  So I tried writing and:  codeBrigittes-Air:~ eggsalad$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop 2017-01-06 03:05:08.652 defaults[17742:1948451] Could not write domain com.apple.screencapture; exiting/code  I'm not sure where the screenshots are being stored if the location does not exist. Ideas?  strongEDIT/strong  I ran something else and got a different response, but defaults are still unchanged.   codeBrigittes-Air:~ eggsalad$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location/Users/eggsalad/Desktop killall SystemUIServer/code  code2017-01-06 03:22:35.444 defaults[18265:2001767] Unexpected argument SystemUIServer; leaving defaults unchanged./code  strong2nd EDIT/strong  Result of:  codels -l ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist/code  was:   codels: /Users/eggsalad/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist: No such file or directory/code  <answer267549> You may have just gotten the commands wrong. Try  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/eggsalad/Desktop /code/pre  make sure to press kbdReturn/kbd, then   precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  and press kbdReturn/kbd again.  Then run  precodedefaults read com.apple.screencapture location /code/pre  <comment335713> To answer your last question, sounds like they're not currently being saved anywhere. But a Spotlight search for a file called '2017-01-06 03:04:47.765' would tell you for sure. <comment335714> Yeah, I'm aware they're not saving- so that file doesn't exist . <comment335724> I tried the first command and it unfortunately responded with the same `Could not write domain com.apple.screencapture; exiting` <comment335726> Can you please run `ls -l ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist` and add the result to the question? <comment335738> @patrix Tried, added result. <comment335756> Hmm, `ls -ld ~/Library/Preferences` as well then, please <comment335847> @patrix Response:   `drwx------+ 196 eggsalad  staff  6664  6 Jan 21:47 /Users/eggsalad/Library/Preferences`
