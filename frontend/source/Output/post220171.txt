Seeing these strange fonts in Safari only <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cJnFg.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is this? copying and pasting this text into a text editor revealed perfect english. Why are they shown this way in Safari 9.0.2 on OS X 10.11.2  <answer220789> OS X builds cache files from the fonts installed on your system. Now and again these cache files can get corrupted.  Try running the following command in a Terminal window (you will be prompted for your password) and rebooting. This will remove these cache files; forcing OS X to re-generate them from scratch.  precodesudo atsutil databases -remove /code/pre  From the codeatsutil/code man page:  precodedatabases      will remove fontd System or User databases along with any cache      files. Removing databases may cause the loss of font registration state:      fonts activated outside the standard font directories, font faces dis-      abled, and font libraries. New databases will be regenerated from fonts      installed the standard font directories after the user logs out,      restarts, or the fontd server is restarted.  databases [-remove | -removeUser]     -remove remove fontd databases for active user and system (used when no     one is logged in and some background processes).     -removeUser remove fontd databases for the active user only. /code/pre  <answer221213> I’ve seen this problem when there are corrupt or duplicate fonts on a system. As an alternative to @Alistair McMillan’s answer you can try this.  You can fix this problem by opening Font Book and trying one of two things.  ol liTry looking for duplicated fonts, and having Font Book fix them.brbrLaunch Font Book, and go to the codeEdit menu/code after it launches.brSelect codeLook for Enabled Duplicates.../code brbrIf it finds enabled duplicates you can choose to codeAuto Correct/code (which is what I suggest). brbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K1qJ6.png" alt="enter image description here" brbr/li liYou can use Font Book to check for corrupted fonts.brbr Launch Font Book, and select codeAll Fonts/code from the Collection panel on the left.brThen go to codeFile menu/code and select codeValidate Font/code.brbr This will run the font validater, and show fonts that have problems. If it does find problems, some of them can be fixed using the Font Validation window. Other problems might require you to uninstalled, and re-install a font to fix the problem./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xBbzd.png" alt="enter image description here"  If none of these work, then I would try the codeatsutil databases -remove/code suggested by @Alistair McMillan.  <comment266444> Looks like a font or cache issue.  Try Fontbook  File  Restore Standard Fonts and if necessary do a Safe Boot. <comment266812> So neither restoring standard fonts nor a safe boot helped? <comment266827> afraid not. it's something deeper. <comment266847> What does the HTML source look like? <comment266891> Safari - Settings - Show Develop Menu / On the page right click - Inspect element - click into the console - make Shit + CMD + C - aim the strange text and click on it - copy the html code from the console. <comment267338> Do you see this problem on a specific site or every site on Safari? If this issue is related to a specific site, does Chrome render it without problems?
