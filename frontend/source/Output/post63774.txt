Force iOS simulator to use WiFi network <body> I have two networks, a WiFi and a cable LAN.  I want use them together, but I want to force the iOS Simulator to use strongonly WiFi/strong, because, the LAN is under proxy, protected, with a lot of limitations.  Any ideas?  <answer63780> The iOS Simulator does not get its own internet connection, it uses the computer's. Therefore, if you want it to use the Wi-Fi network instead of the LAN, just make sure you're connected through Wi-Fi.  In strongSystem Preferences / Network/strong you can rearrange the order in which the computer gains Internet connection. Just place Wi-Fi on top of the list. On strongLion/strong it's done by clicking the emgear/em thingy, and select emSet Service Order/em from the pop-up list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uQhtO.png" alt=""  <comment73890> I don't believe you can simply route one specific app through another network interface, but if you can define specific target hosts or subnets you could set up a different routing for those and route the rest to the first adapter in the list.
