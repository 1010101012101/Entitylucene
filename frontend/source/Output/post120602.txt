Login error after httpd.conf edits <body> I am having a very weird error that I cannot find any help on the rest of the internet for. My issue is that I was editing my httpd.conf (in /Private/etc/apache2) so that I could run the web server out of a different directory. After attempting multiple times (and failing) my system started to act strange. I tried to open XAMPP's httpd.conf using Sublime Text 3 but that threw Sublime Text into a crash loop. I then tried to open another program, and it gave me an error saying that it could not write files. I then tried to close Eclipse and it gave me the error that it could not write files. I figured that a reboot would help and rebooted.  After my system booted up I was unable to log into my main user account. It was giving me the error "You are unable to log into the account "asdf" at this time. An error occurred."  I honestly have no idea why it is not working, but here is what I have tried.  ol liRebooting/li liRepairing the main SSD (Where I store my system files, it said that all was fine)/li liRepairing Permissions on the HDD that holds the User Files (it fixed a ton of applications that were set to different permissions. But it did not change any files that I had been editing./li liRepairing the main HDD (all was fine...)/li /ol  I am at a loss, any help would be greatly appreciated as I cannot use my main user account currently.  <answer120691> For anyone in the future that might have this issue (who knows...) here is what I did to fix it:  ol liGo into System Preferences and delete your old user account. Leave your home folder. DO NOT ERASE IT./li liRecreate the user./li liRight click on the user and select "Advanced Options"/li liIf the home folder location is wrong (if you had it on a different hard drive) change it to the correct place./li liRestart your computer./li liFixed!/li /ol  <comment140627> I haven't tried anything similar, but maybe you can use this trick to at least log on: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57559319-263/how-to-quickly-restore-a-missing-admin-account-in-os-x/ <comment140733> This fixed it for me. I deleted my user then just re-created and re-linked it to the home folder.
