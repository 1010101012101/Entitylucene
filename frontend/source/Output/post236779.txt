If that works (i.e. you boot into Recovery mode), then try doing the same with the left command key.  If that fails, you have a defect keyboard that needs replacement.  <comment289858> Your keyboard is broken.  You need to take it in for service and have the keyboard replaced. <comment289909> Thanks @Allan, I guess you are right, do you know how much it coast ? <comment289910> Hei, @jksoegaard, thanks for your help. I tried your method, the right key works but not the left key. I will take it to the service when I get time :) <comment289926> @Allan, I'm having a similar problem with my keyboard--do you know if you *can* get a keyboard replaced for a Mid-2012 MBP?
