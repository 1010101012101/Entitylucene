SSH Private key connection problem <body> I am trying to connect to a remote server via SSH using a private key. However, it is not working. It fails and finally asks for my password to authenticate to the remote server. I have set this up on on a different remote server previously with zero problems.  I was able to figure out how to enable verbose output from the attempted connection. Here is what I think is the relevant output:  precodedebug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering RSA public key: /Users/xxxxx/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive debug1: Trying private key: /Users/xxxxx/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/xxxxx/.ssh/id_ecdsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/xxxxx/.ssh/id_ed25519 debug1: Next authentication method: keyboard-interactive Password: debug1: Authentication succeeded (keyboard-interactive). Authenticated to xxxxx.org ([xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]:1117). /code/pre  Any idea what is wrong?  <comment360475> Try with -vv please. What OS on the distant server? What version of MacOS on the client? <comment360476> How did you set up the public key authentication? The keys are simply rejected.
