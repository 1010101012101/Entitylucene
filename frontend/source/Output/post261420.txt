running a macbook pro and DAW audio interface <body> Sorry, but very new to this so forgive me if it's already been covered. I'm trying to get 2 different audio streams out from my Mac via a Behringer interface. What I want to achieve is to have 1 programme, let's say iTunes, playing from the headphone jack, and a second, Qlab, from the USB. I would then run these through a sound mixer to play whichever was needed as they always be running. Any help would be gratefully received Thanks  <comment327349> Your question is confusing - you want both streams through the Behringer? or you want one out the Mac's headphone jack & the other to the Behringer? Could you reword your question to clarify? <comment327350> https://figure53.com/docs/qlab/v4/audio/introduction-to-audio/ should have all the info you need. Looks like QLab can assign outputs per patch. Use the regular OS X control panel to send iTunes to headphone socket & Qlab to do the rest
