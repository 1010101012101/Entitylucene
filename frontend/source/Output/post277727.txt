Disable or limit screen brightness OSX <body> I've got a computer lab of MacBook laptops. I would like to strongdisable or limit screen brightness adjustment/strong by students. The point would be to extend battery life as much as possible. Is this possible?  I'm used to doing stuff like this in Windows where there's group policy. Our sys admins have Jamf and Apple Configurator. Are these viable products for such a task?  strongIs it possible to hack this into submission via command line?/strong Maybe some software exists that will take care of this. Any help is much appreciated.
