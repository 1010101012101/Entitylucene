My iPhone 5S won't show street names on Google maps <body> My iPhone 5S won't show street/road names.   All I can see on the map are the 2 dots from/to my destination. I use to be able to see the streets, interstates, cities, etc. The background is basically blank.  <comment184373> Try Apple Maps? ;) <comment184388> delete it, reinstall
