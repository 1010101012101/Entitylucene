Can I make the mouse hairpin in the terminal more visible? <body> It often takes me a while to find the mouse crosshair when working with Terminal.app. Is there a way to make it more visible?  <answer20113> If you mean the blinking cursor, then you need to go into the terminal preferences. Here's a picture to help you better understand  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FEfCp.png" alt="Terminal Prefences"  <answer20126> There's an app available to download called Mouse Locator which will put green markers around your cursor if you press a hotkey.  That might help you but I don't know if it's still a working program under current OS X releases.  <answer110150> I've started having this problem also, not sure if it started happening after i got a retina screen or upgraded to mavericks, or im just getting old. My suggestion is to try iTerm2 which have a bit more visible "hairpin".  <comment22245> Do you want to customize the mouse cursor (while you're moving it around), or the text cursor (that shows you where you are in some text)? <comment22256> Thanks, Slick. But I meant the OSX pointer, it switches to a hairpin when you move it through the Terminal.app window, then it goes back to being an arrow. <comment22259> The mouse pointer that appears when I am over the Terminal.app window. I would like it to be something more visible than a crosshair. <comment58363> To be more clear, this is largely a problem if you have the terminal background set to black, or otherwise a very dark color.  Unlike the arrow pointer, the text select hairpin doesn't have a border color of white to make it visible against any background. <comment183276> Did you find a solution yourself? :) It's very irritating especially with an external main monitor, the pointer gets lost on the side monitor <comment183427> @KaanSoral, nah, I just switched to a light background in iTerm to make it more visible <comment183440> Well it seems it was previously very easy, yet that method no longer works: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107737/i-beam-cursor-color-in-maverickss-terminal <comment220928> I'm having this issue after upgrading to Yosimite from Mountain Lion. It is definitely dimmer. :/
