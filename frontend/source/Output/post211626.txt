Utility to save current selection or clipboard to a file <body> Is there a utility that saves current selection (from terminal, web browser, ...) to a text/html file in a specific location?   I want to use it as a quick note taking tool so I do not have to "create new file, paste, save file" each time I want to take some note.  <answer211627> TextEdit has the Service "New TextEdit Window Containing Selection" &amp; TextWrangler adds the Service "New TextWrangler Document with Selection" to the right click menu.  You could add a key command to either from System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Servicesbr ...though it wouldn't auto-save for you, it might be a start.  <answer211632> Create a shell script codeclip2file/code (or function) in codebash/code:  precode#!/bin/sh  pbpaste -pboard general -Prefer txt &gt; ${1:-~/clip.txt} /code/pre  and run it with  precodeclip2file ~/Desktop/clip.txt /code/pre  to save the current clipboard.  <answer211641> Open Automator and create a service "text2file" with the following steps:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3tuV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  After saving the service, you may choose any text (you don't have to copy it!) and in the context menu - Services choose "text2file" to save the content to clip.txt on your desktop.  After saving the file you can add a shortcut for "text2file" in System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Services - Text - text2file  The screenshot above is taken in Automator 2.2.4/10.7 (Lion). If another system is used the steps might be slightly different.  <comment255471> This seems promising. Will give it a try. Thanks. <comment255652> I get this error "text2file" service could not be used! <comment255657> I don't know what was the problem but after restarting my Mac it now works perfectly. I also needed to change the script to auto-generate the filename. Will write about it on my next weblog post.
