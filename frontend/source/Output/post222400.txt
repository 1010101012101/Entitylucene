Email is not an Apple ID or email is being used as an Apple ID? <body> I am getting these errors when trying to login with my mother's email.  Can it be a bug in Apple?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x0i9B.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6wPp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer222401> Sounds like you are trying to create an apple id. The email you are trying to use already exist as an apple id so you need to create a new apple id (using a different email address) or try to login with that one. If you can't recall the password click on "forgot password?"  <comment269520> I did what you said. One form says this email is not an apple id, one says email is used as an Apple Id.
