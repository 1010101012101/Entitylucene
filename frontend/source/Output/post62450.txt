How to share files between two Macs at home? <body> I've turned file sharing on both my Macs here at home. One is an iMac, the other a MacBook Pro. I'm sure there's more to it but I can't seem to figure that out. Both are internet connected through WiFi.  <answer62469> I guess your question is how exactly do you share files. To access the shared files just:  ol liWhile in Finder select strongGo  Connect to Server.../strong or hit kbdCommand/kbd+kbdK/kbd./li liA window will appear, prompting for the Server's URL, which is the File Sharing Computer's network IP, something like code192.168.1.2/code. Before the URL you must write codeafp:///code. So, it will look like codeafp://192.168.1.2/code./li liThe other Mac's sharing folder will be mounted on your Finder. /li /ol  strongJust so you know/strong, when you enable the strongFile Sharing/strong, beneath the green emlight/em, the exact URL of strongthat/strong computer will be shown. The codeafp://your.network.ip.number/codethingy.   If you are using Lion, or later, strongAirdrop/strong is, by far, the best option for file sharing. It requires no setup nor special settings, and it sends the files wirelessly, without having both Macs to be connected to the same Wifi network.    <comment72150> If they are on the same LAN (which they probably are) the "other" Mac should also show up in the sidebar of any Finder window.
