Is there any way to add a NTFS option in the format list of Disk Utility in OS X EI Captian? <body> There are two partitions on my drive, one for time machine, one for storing files which are exFat format.  I would like to get one minimal thing to support NTFS, I would like to create a filesystem and skip writing to it.   How might this be possible without enabling full NTFS support?  img src="https://ww2.sinaimg.cn/large/6110a121gw1exvzaemzzoj20xw0j2tbq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment259714> Welcome to Ask Different.  Asking why Apple did X is generally off topic. I see this is closed as duplicate to help answer what can be done  to solve a specific problem. Before asking the new question, if you're trying to  actually do something on OS X, please edit that specific task in relation to the decision that Apple made as opposed to asking for discussion on the decision itself. <comment259851> Thank you @bmike,  I edited my question. What I am asking is not the ntfs write feature, I just want to format a partition of my usb disk to ntfs by disk utility. And I tried solutions on this page http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20889/how-do-i-write-to-ntfs-drives-in-os-x, all are not work for me. <comment259964> Perfect. I'll reopen this now it's clear you don't care to write to NTFS, just to carve out that space. <comment260005> If you aren't going to write to it under OSX, why would you try to format it under OSX?  Why not format your NTFS partition while the box is booted into an OS that supports NTFS?
