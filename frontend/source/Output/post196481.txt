Unable to save zip attachment using Automator <body> I’ve set up a a simple Automator script that saves Apple Mail (OS X Yosemite) attachments to a folder. It’s working great with images. However  when I select a email which includes a *.zip file. the script aborts with OSStatus error - 10000.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ovfCJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I debug this error message? For hours I am looking for a simple script that autosaves attachment to a folder. There are lot's of AppleScript - unfortunately none of them seem to work with OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Any solutions?  <comment234804> I didn't read the entire post, but you may try [this](http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=43549) <comment234807> Thanks for your reply.

Moreover the attachment file name doesn't use the same name. <comment234823> Correct, you'd need to do something like go through directories and copy all files with them, which is messy. It may be that Apple intended this to keep you from copying something potentially harmful to an unprotected directory without meaning to
