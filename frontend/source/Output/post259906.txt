How to block senders in Messages app on Mac OS X? How to mark as spam? <body> Getting many junk texts during election season.   Messages come to both my iPhone and MacBook Pro (connected via my iCloud account).   I'm not seeing any way to mark messages as spam, nor to block senders.

They must be a Contact to block them :/  Messages  Prefs  Blocked. Typing the number gets you nowhere... they must be already in contacts to make it work. I'll add it to the answer, but I hope someone finds something better.
