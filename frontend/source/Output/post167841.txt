Modify plist.info so program uses different icon based on command line arguments <body> I have an application, Firefox, I launch it with different command line arguments:  ul licode-P "dev profile" -no-remote/code/li licode-P "ext testing" -no-remote/code/li licode-P "Main" -no-remote/code/li /ul  I would like to tell the plist.info file to use a different icon based on the the different command line arguments, is this possible? It gets confusing have the same icon 3 times when all profiles are open.  Sincerely
