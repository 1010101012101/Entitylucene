All-in-one USB-C Dock for 2016 15" Macbook Pro <body> I frequently need to plug the following into my 15" touchbar MacBook Pro:  ul liExternal monitor (2560x1440@60hz)/li liUSB Mouse/li liUSB Keyboard/li liPower (something in the 60W+ range - not 15W)/li /ul  Currently all the adapters needed to do that are turning my desk into a rat's nest and I'd rather not plug 3 separate things in every time I set my laptop down.  I've looked around and can't find anything that fits the requirements. Anyone know of something that fits the bill?  <answer293727> Sounds like you want a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 dock. One cord connects all the peripherals you ask for to your Mac.  OWC makes several, StarTech makes several, Belkin makes amazing one - http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F4U095-APL/  Be sure you know if you're getting one that charges your Mac - they cost a little more, but should be much more stable for video / power and save your Apple adapter to sit in your go bag or the second place you plug in.  If you want a bargain - you could get a ThunderBolt 2 adapter, but then you still need a power cord and also the cost of TB-3 to TB-2 adapter. Probably not cheaper based on the prices I see today for docks.  <comment370663> Thanks! That fits the bill perfectly (although damn that's pricey! You could buy an iPad for the cost of that thing).
