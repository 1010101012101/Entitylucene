Automator PDF actions <body> When using the Automator PDF action "PDF to images" any annotations made to a PDF using preview are not converted as part of the output images. The base images are there but the annotations are not rendered.  Any solutions on this?  <answer138600> I've just tested this with the following workflow, selecting the Legal Notices.pdf from Photoshop CC as my sample, and it worked fine, keeping all annotations on the PDF.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wspJq.png" width="530"  One thing to note that may be causing the problem is that the PDF is not saved. When adding annotations to a PDF, don't forget to save the PDF before running the workflow. If Preview states that the PDF has been edited, don't forget to save.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U8nqA.png" width="500"
