How to encrypt exFAT on external drive? <body> I have a lot of data on my external drive.br The file system is the exFAT.br I believe it is not possible to encrypt that filesystem with FileVault.  Do you know how (tool maybe) to encrypt exFAT on an external drive without changing filesystem?  <answer227882> I confirm that drives that use the FAT or the exFAT file format canâ€™t be encrypted using FileVault.   Therefore, if this can help, I suggest you to create two partitions of the device using two different file format.  <comment277776> Thank you for quick answer @Mattia. Sadly It is hard for me because I don't have additional disk to migrate 2T data to make partitioning. <comment277845> This answer is correct. FileVault disk encryption requires your disk to be GPT (GUID partition table) and the volume type to be OSX extended (journaled JHFS+). I believe that an exFAT volume is not dynamically resizeable, so it would not be possible to create a small encrypted JHFS+ volume and progressively migrate files from one volume to the other whilst resizing both volumes (i.e. - growing the encrypted volume and shrinking the exFAT volume). You will need to borrow/buy more disk space. You could temporarily use cloud-based storage (eg BackBlaze) if your internet connection is very fast. <comment277956> I did as you suggested. I borrowed the other disk made a copy and reformat to HFS+ with encryption. Thank you! <comment277965> @HolySync I'm glad to know that.
