Executing "Copy Dropbox Link" with a script <body> I want to create a script that executes the command from the contextual (control-click) menu, "Copy Dropbox Link". How can I access this command with Applescript (or any other Mac scripting service)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhP7R.png" alt="Contextual Menu with &quot;Copy Dropbox Link&quot; Highlighted"  My goal is to create a LaunchBar 6 (by Objective Development) action that grabs the Dropbox link of a file selected emin LaunchBar/em. LaunchBar works like a high-powered version of the native Spotlight app.   I'm running OS X 10.11.6.  <comment312861> 1. By "Launchbar" do you actually mean **LaunchBar** as in the app from [Objective Development](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html)? 2. When you say "of a selected file", from where are you selecting the file, in Finder or where exactly? These are pieces of information you should include in your question. <comment313098> Thanks for the comment @user3439894! I've clarified the issues you identified with my question.
