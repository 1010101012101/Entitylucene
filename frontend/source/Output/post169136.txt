Sort Contacts Marked As Company <body> I found an Applescript at apple's support site to sort any contact with the "Company" checkmark checked into a "Business" group:  precodeproperty groupName : "Business" tell application "Contacts"     if (name of groups as list) does not contain groupName then         make new group at end of groups with properties {name:groupName}     end if     repeat with singlePerson in people         if company of singlePerson is true then             if (people of group groupName as list) does not contain (singlePerson as list) then                 make new person at end of group groupName with data singlePerson             end if         end if     end repeat     save end tell /code/pre  It fails on:  precode            make new person at end of group groupName with data singlePerson /code/pre  With error:  precodeerror "Contacts got an error: AppleEvent handler failed." number -10000 /code/pre  strongDoes anyone know of a method to sort out all contacts checkmarked as "Company"?/strong  For example I do NOT want anyone who has a company name but is an individual card:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRMFh.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I DO want companies with the codeCompany/code box checkmarked:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FQ3S6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer169138> strongUpdate:/strong  I originally thought You don't need Applescript to do this.  And you could create a Smart Group that does it for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kaNsz.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jqAG3.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongBUT/strong  the 'Company: is set' is not for the checkbox. Its for the actual Company text field.  So you cannot use the above for this as it does not care if the checkbox for company is ticked or not. It only cares if there is text in the Company field.  So Applescript IS the way to go. And using  codecompany is true/code which refers to the checkbox.  precode    property groupName : "Business" tell application "Contacts"      if not (exists (group groupName)) then         make new group with properties {name:groupName}     end if     set the_people to people whose company is true     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in the_people         set this_person to item i of the_people         add this_person to group groupName         save     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment198671> This does not work.  I am looking for a method that only selects contacts with the "Company" box checkmarked.  This method selects everyone who has a company name filled in (including individual contacts) <comment198672> See my edit above in my Q. <comment198733> @Chrismas007 , Ah I see what you are after now.
