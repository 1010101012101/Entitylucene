macOS Sierra console search criteria <body> Is there a way to filter the console by multiple criteria? I'd like to display only warnings and errors from the PHP log file. The following searches for the string codeerror warning/code which doesn't exist  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQsRa.png" alt="error"  <answer259562> When you open Console, you automatically enter "All messages" section, but you can try switching to Errors and Faults filter which is already created there. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/udk0L.png" alt="enter image description here" It will give you additional search options the next time you try to filter messages, just click on a search bar and choose what type of messages you want to view. Hope it'll help.  <comment324815> It appears this only works with the device log, which doesn't record the Apache/PHP errors. I moved my PHP log into the /Library/Logs folder that's listed in the Reports column. All Messages and Errors & Faults becomes grayed out. <comment324898> I see. Sorry, there's no other solution I can think of at the moment. <comment354071> The Console app has limited functionality when analysing text log files;  it's built for filtering output from macOS's unified logging system.  You could try an alternative log analysis tool like lnav â€” http://lnav.org
