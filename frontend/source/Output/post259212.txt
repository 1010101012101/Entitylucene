My Chrome on Mac (with Mac OS Sierra) always starts with feed.snowbitt.com when I run it <body> I always get redirected to site feed.snowbitt.com when I run my Chrome. I tried to: -Delete Chrome from computer, and reinstall it. Didn' work. -Clear all my content, browsing history from Chrome. Didn't work. -I tried some free antivirus programs to scan my cimputer. Didn't work.  What else can I do?  <answer259213> Go to Chrome  Preferences... by pressing kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbd,/kbd or by typing strongchrome://settings//strong into the Address Bar.  Under the strongOn start-up/strong settings, make sure you have selected strongOpen the New Tab page/strong and not some specific page, which in your case is: "feed.snowbitt.com"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MNA7F.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer259221> I resolved the issue by signing off on my Google Chrome account on Chrome, uninstalling Chrome, and reinstalling again. Then signing in then.  <answer259328> I think there is the standard opening page option referred to above but I this can also have to do with an extension, some spam-like setting. Search for that.  <comment324234> I tried that too, and it didn't work. <comment324237> Did you sign back in then? No redirection then? <comment324433> I unsigned from Chrome, reinstalled Chrome, and signed in to Chrome account. I don't know what you mean by redirection. <comment324435> In your question you wrote: "I always get redirected" - that is what I am asking about. After re-installing Chrome did your problem disappear?
