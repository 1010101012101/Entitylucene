Can you login into another user via `ssh`?  Did you restart `sshd` after setting `PermitRootLogin` to `yes`? <comment151227> root is enabled so i can log in as root locally. I can also log in as another user via ssh. I restarted sshd with launchctl (sudo launchctl unload  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist). <comment151433> Thank you. I added "Administrators" and it works now.
