iPhone 5C screen dead after impactâ€”how to fix? <body> My iPhone 5C suffered a 5-foot drop onto a hard wood floor (landing on its back). The screen is undamaged, and still very much on, but it doesn't respond to touch at all.  It functions fine otherwise. I did a soft reset and a factory reset and nothing. I replaced the screen because I thought it was a problem with the digitizer. Still nothing. I'm officially out of ideas and any help would be appreciated.  <comment317584> Go to the Apple Store!
