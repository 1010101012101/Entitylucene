Course of action to clean up RAM on sluggish mac <body> Below is an EtreCheck report on my system. My problem is that I have &lt;3 GB or 2.5 GB even after a reboot, with relatively few menu bar applications starting up. (This drops to 20-300 MB once Chrome is running!) I know I could try a clean install, maybe that would take me less time than a cleanup. Still, if I'd start a cleanup, which seem the more important things to start with? Launch agents or launch daemons? Any of them in particular? Extensions? Any of them is more notorious than others? Thanks.  Problem description: My system has less than 3 GB free RAM (out of 8) even right after a reboot.  precodeEtreCheck version: 2.1.8 (121) Report generated February 27, 2015 at 10:17:56 AM EST Download EtreCheck from http://etresoft.com/etrecheck  Click the [Click for support] links for help with non-Apple products.

As others have mentioned the operating system will keep recently used files in caches to improve performance, but it frees up that memory very quickly as soon as something else needs it. Low free RAM isn't necessarily a cause for concern.  If you want to confirm whether lack of RAM is a problem, then try to run your system for a typical day of use and then run EtreCheck. Check the Page-Outs values at the bottom of the report. If Page-Outs is high (measured in GBs) then you likely need more RAM for whatever you are doing on your Mac.  Aside from that you do have a lot of extensions, agents, daemons, etc though. You are right to be focussing on them. There are none listed that stand out to me as particularly problematic, so I'd recommend starting by removing the ones you don't need. Things that you installed to try out but then forgot about after trying them once or twice, or things that are remnants of old software you no longer use (for example I think the "Open in Internet Explorer" Safari extension is installed by Parallels; if you no longer use Parallels then remove the extension). Then focus on the ones that say "running" or "loaded" as they are actually using resources on your machine.  <comment205752> For best efficiency there should be no free RAM it all should be in use for caches etc? What is running slowly and what does activity monitor show <comment205782> Well, Chrome is a memory hog for sure. Easily losing 2 extra GBs from the 3 left free even if only 3 tabs are open. Many other operations are sluggish, esp. the Finder (shall I suspect Dropbox?). I was suspecting disk intensive operations to be slow (esp. on a spinning HDD), but running down to 30-200 MB free RAM makes me suspicious that Yosemite is not *that* efficient managing caches and RAM. Or what could I check for you, and how? <comment205817> What happens to the RAM usage if you open other applications than Chrome or an another web browser like Safari? Google Chrome is known to use much RAM but not that much as you describe. <comment205832> @Dempa I use Chrome Canary with quite a few flags turned on, maybe it does eat a few GBs. But even in that case, I would expect Yosemite release some RAM if it was hoarding it only "just in case" while it could. When I am down to 300MB or less, I cannot accept the OS still taking up 5GB and not releasing it. That's not smart caching, that's a memory leak. What else is there to do to investigate? <comment205835> @László Does the extreme RAM use only happen after launching Chrome or does it happen if you open other apps and when the OS is just running by itself? <comment205839> @Dempa The OS (plus launchdaemons) uses 5 GB after a reboot. It does not leak and take more than that. However, I don't see  the OS caching etc. being smart, as apps seem to use only the remaining 3 GB, I don't see the OS flexibly releasing more as the apps run into, say, the last 1 GB of free RAM. With smart caching I would expect it to be harder to run down to 30MB of free RAM. But no, this is easily possible with a few apps open, as the apps seem to share only the 3 GB not free after a reboot, and never get back more than that. <comment205847> The cache is part of the memory used so faces will not be in the free RAM. The memory released by apps can be taken by cache and not go into free memory <comment205933> @Mark I get that, thanks. I would still expect to be harder to run out of RAM if the OS were releasing its cache. I suspect it does not really.
