Full Keyboard Access keeps getting turned off <body> In System Preferences, "Keyboard", I like to keep "Full Keyboard Access" set to "All Controls".   However, something keeps switching this setting back to "Text boxes and lists only". I'm the only person who uses my Mac. And I know for a fact I never set it to "Text boxes and lists only", I always, emalways/em want "All Controls" selected.  So, some program must be changing this setting for me. How can I find out what is causing the setting to be changed?
