How to hide page number pop-up that obscures text in iPhone PDFs? <body> I've noticed this after upgrading my iPhone to iOS 7.1.  When scrolling a PDF on iPhone 7.1, a little grey box pops up with page number information near  the upper right hand corner of the PDF (e.g., it might say code2 of 32/code to indicate that you are on page 2 of a 32 page document). Then, if you wait a few more seconds, it disappears. The problem is that when I scroll, the pop up obscures the text that I want to read. This is particularly noticeable when viewing a PDF with the phone in landscape orientation.  ul liIs there a way of hiding this page number information?/li liIf not, is there a place to complain about this step back in usability?/li /ul  E.g., see below how code2 of 4/code is obscuring the text:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BNmR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment169407> Partial workaround: The Dropbox app no longer puts the page number there. You can save a PDF from the browser and then read it in Dropbox.
