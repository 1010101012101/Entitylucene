Can iPad be hacked if password's security is questionable? <body> Is it possible for a "family member" that knows my passwords and has had access to my iPad to control my iPad from a different location? ....Camera or even turn off my iPad completely?  Recently my iPad screen had been completely locked out without my knowledge. The timing of this event was after an argument with this family member. I had to take it back to store to activate it.  Can the iPad be controled from a different location?  <answer168049> Assuming you have the Find my iPad enabled, one can use that feature (from another device while knowing your password) to lock it remotely.     Activation Lock.      Activation Lock is designed to prevent anyone from using your iPhone,   iPad, or iPod touch if you ever lose your device. It starts working   the moment you turn on Find My iPhone. From then on, your Apple ID and   password will be required before anyone can turn off Find My iPhone,   erase your device, or reactivate it. This can help you keep your   device secure, even if itâ€™s in the wrong hands.   <answer168727>    Can iPad be hacked if password's security is questionable?   strongYes/strong.
