Why does my iPhone 6s iOS 10.1.1 play random music when synced with car <body> Every time I sync my iPhone with my Prius audio system my music tries to play randomly when not selected. It interrupts phone calls and other streaming content. When it does this the music app doesn't even show it's open. Help!
