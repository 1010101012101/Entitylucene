Is there a way to access HealthKit data through a web interface? <body> I would like to read, and ideally write to, my HealthKit data from a computer's web browser. Is this possible? I have not found any tools so far that let me do it.  An out of the box tool is ideal, but a script-based workaround that syncs with Google Spreadsheets or Dropbox would work as well.  <answer186219> I haven't found any out-of-the-box solutions, but I'm looking for something similar, and posted this related question.  Options:  ul liexport data as XML files and email them to yourself/li liuse iTunes backup, 3rd party backup reader, get sqlite3 Databases/li /ul  Either of these two can be fed into a PHP/RoR/JSP/.NET etc.. web app but so far there's no way to do it without manual intervention.
