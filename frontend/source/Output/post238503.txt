Apple mail adding calendar invitations despite this being disabled <body> I've disabled Apple Mail from automatically adding calendar invitations, however when they're sent to me, they still get automatically added to my Apple Calendar. The problem with this, of course, is that sometimes events get added but I'm unaware unless I check the Calendar.  Both my Apple Mail and Calendar are linked to MS Exchange latest version, and I do not use Outlook concurrently.  Ive tried checking and unchecking the Apple Mail preference, to no avail.  Any suggestions?  This happens in all my devices, using the latest versions.

Or maybe one of your other Apple devices is adding them and that change is being propagated to all your calenders. <comment323037> Check Settings  Internet Accounts to see which accounts have access to your calendar. It's probably some other account that adds them,
