Are the two SATA bus interfaces in the 2010 Mac mini equal in speed? <body> I want to replace the DVD in my old 2010 mac mini with a SSD but first I would like to know if the two SATA interfaces are equal when it comes to speed.  I would prefer to keep the harddrive on the first interface as it is much easier to change it than is to change the one in the DVD location.  <answer77350> You can answer this question yourself by running Apple System Profiler/System Information and noting what it reports under the "Serial-ATA" column.  Here is what the report looks like on my MacBook Pro.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSFHr.png" alt="enter image description here"
