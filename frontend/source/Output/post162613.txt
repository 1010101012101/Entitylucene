iCloud password reset <body> How do I change the Apple iCloud password that is synched to a computer no longer available to me?br I am trying to backup my contacts to my new computer.  I have loaded the latest iTunes application on my notebook.  updates my iPhone 4S iOS8.  The mobile icon doesn't appear in iTunes.  The folder shows up in the drive tree.    So I am trying to backup everything to an iCloud account however I can't access it.  <answer162614> If you do not have the password for an iCloud account, and also do not have the means to reset it via appleid.apple.com page, then you can't do anything with that iCloud account.  Also, it seems you have a couple of issues: iTunes not recognising your iPhone?  PD: Why would you want to backup everything to an iCloud account you can no longer access?
