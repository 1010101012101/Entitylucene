How do I use Mac's Preview application text speech feature? <body> How could I let Preview start speaking a selected paragraph? I found the speech menu item in the edit menu but this starts speaking from the beginning of the document!  <answer3672> There is a convenient way of making your Mac speak any selected text.  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liSelect strongSpeech/strong./li liSelect the strongText to Speech/strong tab if it is not already selected./li liCheck the box for strongSpeak selected text when the key is pressed/strong and provide a key combination of your choice./li /ol  You can now use the key combination to speak selected text system-wide.  <answer281843> I read the above comment and tried to follow the instructions I was unsuccessful (as I didn't highlight the text).  Although, having now solved the issue you need to highlight the selected text and then press the key combination (mine is ctrl+s).  Now I use it on all applications including preview, Microsoft Word, chrome etc.  I love it.    <comment244615> I did the instructions above, pressed the right key combo and nothing was said
