How can I change the default save location of Office for Mac? <body> I have Office for Mac 2011 and unlike Office PC, I can't find how to change the location where my files are to be saved.  The default position doesn't suit my needs and I spend a lot of time "navigating" to the folder where I store all my projects.  I would like to open a file, edit it's contents, and "save as" a different file name, but to the same file folder from which the document was originally opened... just like you can on a PC.  <answer92238> The File Locations preference pane allows to to specify the location for all documents to be saved.  In Word Preferences... select File Locations:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AeOll.jpg" alt="screencap of Word prefs"  When in File Locations, set the path you want Word to use by clicking in the Location field. The default setting, which appears blank in the screencap below, is to ~/Documents.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0bJw5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer97696> It's not in Apple preferences but in Word's own codePreferences/code. See the drop down menu of codeWord/code in top left corner while the program is running, not the Apple symbol.  <comment109397> can you guide me through this? - I looked under apple-preferences but cant find "file locations"...thanks <comment109402> Expanded my original answer. Cheers! <comment114680> How does this differ from @IconDaemon ' s more complete answer? <comment177146> When I change that setting, it seems to have no effect when I restart, create a new document, and then click save.  It defaults back to ~/Documents when I changed it and verified the modified setting.  I have Word version 14.4.4 (140807). <comment181925> I think you need to make the location as blank. I made it to be in ~/Document and now it always tries to save in my ~/Document folder, which is not what we want!
