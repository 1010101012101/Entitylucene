How to Launch Multiple Applications Together? <body> I was wondering if there was an easy way to launch a specific Application whenever another Application is launched.  In other words, I want to launch multiple Applications together as a group.  To be more specific, I have  small app that downloads lyrics for the currently playing iTunes track, and another that writes the currently playing track to a file.  The problem is, I often forget to launch these apps when I start iTunes.  I would like them to open strongevery time/strong I open iTunes.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  <answer120846> Save a plist like this as code~/Library/LaunchAgents/some.label.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;some.label&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;bash&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;if pgrep -x iTunes;then open -jga Some\ Application;open -jga Another\ Application;fi&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Then run codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/some.label.plist/code.  code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist/code seems to be modified every time iTunes is opened. The program will be run every time code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist/code is modified (and there's at least 10 seconds from the last run), but it's probably better than running the program for example every 5 seconds.  For most applications, codeopen -jg/code opens the application hidden and without making it frontmost. For some applications like TextEdit, it opens a new visible window if the application is open but has no windows, but you can use codepgrep -x TextEdit||open -jga TextEdit/code or codelsappinfo launch nofront=true launchandhide=true /Applications/TextEdit.app/code instead.  <comment140974> Wowie zowie!  This answer is so great I wish I could accept it twice!  I've set up the plist and everything is working exactly the way I wanted. <comment141752> After some more testing, it turns out that `com.apple.iTunes.plist` is also modified every time you reload podcasts or sync devices.  To guard against unnecessary Application starting, I added a boolean check to the first line of the command: `if pgrep -x iTunes &amp;&amp; ! pgrep -x OtherApp; ...` (The `&amp` is needed to escape the ampersand in the XML plist.)
