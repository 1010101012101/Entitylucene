What are the dimensions for the apple dock icons? <body> I have figured out how to change the icon for my program that I made in java, but now the default icon goes and nothing is there, is it because of the incorrect dimensions? I currently have a 16x16 logo, is anyone able to help me with what the dimensions need to do in order for it to display correctly?  Additional Note: The icon is a .png file if that helps in any way.  <answer166738> An app's Dock Tile Icon should be strong1024 Ã— 1024/strong.  For more information about customising your Dock Tile, see the documentation:  ul liMac Developer Library: Dock Tile Programming Guide/li /ul  Keep in mind that implementation (software development) is off-topic here.  <comment195457> Whoa! That seems awfully big for such a little thing! haha <comment195463> It's still coming up blank - even when it is 1024 x 1024 - bearing in mind that this is Java. <comment195471> @Connor [Implementation is off-topic here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).
