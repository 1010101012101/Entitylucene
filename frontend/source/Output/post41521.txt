Compressing server into .jar file <body> Currently I'm attempting to compress a decompressed jar file that I have changed into a jar file. How can I do this via the command line? I know that there is a codejar/code command in terminal, I'm just having trouble learning how to compress that folder.  If the folder's directory (probably not correct term, but hopefully you get the idea) is code/Users/Odinulf/folderone/foldertwo/code (foldertwo is directory that I want compressed), what would be the exact code to do this?  Thanks in advance,  Odinulf  <answer41523> precodecd /Users/Odinulf/folderone jar cvf myjar.jar foldertwo /code/pre  For example:  precode/Users/ian/code/tmp [ian@Ian-Cs-MacBook-Pro] [19:13] &gt; jar cvf myjar.jar 8779  added manifest adding: 8779/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%) adding: 8779/.DS_Store(in = 6148) (out= 355)(deflated 94%) adding: 8779/logs/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%) adding: 8779/logs/MasterLog.txt(in = 3044043) (out= 207357)(deflated 93%) adding: 8779/logs/StartLog.txt(in = 6984480) (out= 685836)(deflated 90%) /Users/ian/code/tmp [ian@Ian-Cs-MacBook-Pro] [19:13] &gt; ls *.jar myjar.jar /code/pre  Breaking it down, the options are:  ul licodec/code - create a jar file/li licodev/code - be verbose when you do it/li licodef/code - put the bitstream in to a file instead of standard out/li /ul  Then you give it the file to put the bitstream in to. In this case codemyjar.jar/code. And then you give it a list of directories and files to put in to that jar bitstream. Relative and absolute pathing for contents is generally maintained so be careful with that.  <comment47082> Just another quick question: I get this error when I try to open the jar `Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from [jar file path]` <comment47083> Googled it quickly... got this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2591516/why-its-failed-to-load-main-class-manifest-attribute-from-jar-file - got any suggestions? <comment47085> Yes, you need to create a manifest.txt file for your Jar file according to the to answer in that SO question you found. That'd be a Java question and it's veering in to off-topic for Ask Different. <comment54335> Update: I just used `jar cvfm`, and it worked fantastically. Thanks for your help :D
