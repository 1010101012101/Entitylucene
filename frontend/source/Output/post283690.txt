iPhone reminders unreliable - how to improve? <body> I find the Reminders app very important and useful, particularly scheduled reminders that repeat themselves.  I have tried to use reminders several times over the years, but have always found Reminders to be hit-and-miss, unreliable.  Sometimes reminders pop up when they should, sometimes they don't.  (Yes, I have all Notifications turned on for reminders).  Just this morning, I had a reminder at 7am that should have popped up as a notification, and stayed there until I acknowledged it.  But it didn't.  I opened the Reminders app (no badge displayed), and found the reminder still there, saying it was due.  So why was there no notification? no badge? no "reminder" about this reminder? (This is a scheduled reminder that is due every morning at 7, and set to repeat daily).  I really want this app to be as reliable as other Apple offerings and functionality, but it's just not there for me.  Am I the only one who experiences unreliability and inconsistency with Reminders?  Is there some way we can get Apple's attention drawn to this?  I am running iOS 10.3.1 on an iPhone 6, but I will owned multiple iPhones over the years, and have always experienced similar problems with Reminders.  <answer283717> I would suggest forgetting Apple's preinstalled reminder app and getting a 3rd party one like Wunderlist.  Search Reminder app on the AppStore and see what you get.  <comment357687> There should be a way to automatically delete completed reminders. (No brainer!) <comment357743> Welcome to Ask Different!  While this answer is not wrong, it is of poor quality.  Add some detail as to **why** you think the OP should forget about using Apple's Reminders?  What do 3rd party apps do, that you're suggesting, that Apple's doesn't do?  We prefer a fuller, more detailed answer.  See [answer] for tips.  - From Review
