How to number pages in pdf document? <body> How can I add numbers to pages in pdf document?   Is there a free software for this?  I found in google only full version of Adobe Acrobat, which can make it.  This works, but I need to add number in right corner for each odd page and in left corner for each even page.  <answer139290> You can use Preview. Tools Menu/Annotate/Text, or it's the top right icon next to the search box, then icons appear below for annotation choices.
