When I plug my earbuds into my macbook pro, the sound in the left side is "Fizzy" <body> Like I said in the title, whenever I plug my earbuds (or any earbud/earphone) into my macbook pro the sound on the left side only puts out a hiss-like (Fizzy) sound. I've plugged my earbuds into my iPhone and other devices that play music and it sounded fine, but it's just my macbook. I've already tried resetting the PRAM and that didn't work. The right side sounds fine, and my macbook's speakers are fine. If anyone has any good suggestions it would be very helpful and appreciated. Thank you.  <answer259665> A quick test to narrow down the cause.  ol liLaunch Audio Midi Setup [Applications/Utilities]  /li liIn the Audio Devices panel, click the item on the left that shows the small speaker icon when your headset is plugged in.
