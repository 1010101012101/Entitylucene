How find and delete video or movies that don't show somewhere in the Finder? <body> "About this Mac""Storage" shows 106 GB of Movies. The Movies Folder shows only ~500 MB. I also have deleted the TV shows downloaded from iTunes, so they are gone. Where are the remaining 105 GB of movies? How can I delete them?   <comment356343> I always use. [Daisy Disk](https://daisydiskapp.com/) to find large files. You can use the trial to locate large files and folders and open them in finder to delete. If you right click a file or a folder, it should give you the "show in Finder" option. <comment356576> Thanks - I downloaded it and it is a big help.  I think that movie clips in Photos were included in Movies in Apple's "Storage" but not in "Movies" on the Finder sidebar.  So I could not find them there - they were in Photos. The Daisy app gives a lot of useful visibility into piles of old files.  Thanks for the tip - I have already bought it. <comment356681> I'm glad it helped
