Installing glassfish on Mountain Lion <body> I downloaded glassfish-3.1.2.2-unix.sh from glassfish.java.net. To install I did   precodechmod +x glassfish-3.1.2.2-unix.sh  /code/pre  then i tried to run it :  precode$ ./glassfish-3.1.2.2-unix.sh  This program requires DISPLAY environment variable to be set. Please re-run after assigning an appropriate value to DISPLAY. /code/pre  Any idea ?  Thanks  <answer63382> The DISPLAY variable tells the X11 libraries where the X11 server is located.  Try  precode export DISPLAY=:0 /code/pre  I do not believe the Unix installer supports installing OS X services, so unless you have very explicit needs at this time you can get along just with the zip-distribution of Glassfish.  Unzip it and run codeasadmin start-domain/code.  <comment73279> It worked both ways :) Thanks...however what is this command doing ? export DISPLAY=:0 ...i googled for it but still not very clear ... <comment73280> It is a shell environment variable which is being set and made available to future programs.  The ":0" means the first screen+keyboard on the local computer.   OS X does not use X11 by default or this variable would have been set transparently.
