How do I unlearn a word? <body> I have accidentally learned 'formating'.  I've tried unlearning by right-click, and have removed the word from the code/Library/Spelling/code and code~/Library/Spelling directories/code.   The word is still not underlined in red when I type it on various apps.  Is there any way to make sure the word is unlearned?   Pages recognises the word as incorrect, but not TextEdit or Google Chrome.  <answer236973> As a workaround: add the correction to your Keyboard prefs.  precodeSysPrefs &gt; Keyboard &gt; Text  formating --&gt; formatting /code/pre  I know it's not the strongemreal/em/strong solution you want, but perhaps helps in the mean time.  <answer236975> Did you look here?br [ How to delete a word accidentally added to the Pages dictionary? ]  Looks like you can right-click the word and choose codeunlearn/code.  <comment290101> Yes, I have (as per my post).  I've checked Local Dictionary and it is empty.  Should I just delete the file? <comment290104> Yes.  Reboots and full shut offs. Let me try logging off. <comment290105> As per my post, yes I have tried that with no success. <comment290246> You post says you removed it from the dictionaries - I assume that meant you did it manually (opening the dictionaries?) - did you mean you actually right-clicked `formating` in TextEdit or something and chose `Unlearn`?
