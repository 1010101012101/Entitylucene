Time Machine failing with (null) error <body> I'm getting the following after about half an hour of Preparing Backup:  ul liSetting security information: Operation not permitted/li liError processing extended attributes: Input/output error Error moving - -- disk image from /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/com.apple.backupd.WpUkVn/iMac.tmp.sparsebundle to /Volumes/TimeMachine/iMac.sparsebun... /li liFailed to create disk image /Volumes/TimeMachine/iMac.sparsebundle, status: 512/li liBackup failed with error 20: 20 /li liNetwork destination already mounted at: /Volumes/TimeMachine /li listatfs call failed, error: 2 No such file or directory/li /ul  I had Time Machine working but now nothing. A few extra things:  ul liI have completely formatted the partition. /li liI have tried deleting the Time Machine preference file. /li liI am using a router running Netatalk.

If I partition the drive on OSX first (hfsplus, no journaling), then mount it under Linux, chmod &amp; chgrp it to the TimeMachine userID, and share with netatalk, then I get the same error you report (after "preparing backup", error is "Setting security information: Operation not permitted"), and backup fails every time.    However, if I stop netatalk, repartition the USB drive to a single EXT4 partition, mkfs.ext4, remount and chmod, chgrp, and share with netatalk, then I do not see this error and TimeMachine backups work fine.  I expect that the problem is userID/permission related, but since ETX4 is working for me, I have not pursued it.   <comment275433> Yes. This solution worked for me, both on Yosemite and El Capitan. Thanks. <comment311685> Thanks a lot. If I know that netatalk works with ext4 I don't even choose hfs+ format. Any restart without properly umount makes the drive read only, and you have to fsck it to make writable again.
