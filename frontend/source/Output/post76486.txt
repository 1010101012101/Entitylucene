How to use an external microphone <body> I want to use an external microphone on a 13" MBP.  I am plugging the external microphone to the single audio port (which I normally use for speakers).  I am setting "Use audio port for" option (System Preferences  Sound  Input  Use Audio Port For) to "Sound Input". Doing this changes nothing on the device list. "Internal Microphone" still exists in the list and type is set to "Built in."  Also the microphone does not work. Built in microphone still captures sound but sound from my external microphone still does not get captured (I am using an electro guitar as external microphone and the notes I play does not get recognised by Input Level indicator nor my sound recording application.)  Am I missing something? How can I get "Use audio port for" option to actually work?  <comment88705> Since your guitar signal is not amplified, I guess this won't work. <comment88709> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4541420?tstart=0 <comment88776> Okay http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/082/456/Okay.png <comment88791> Did you change the input device in the recording application?
