Can I RDP to MacBook? <body> The physical screen is damaged on my MacBook Pro, so I'd like to RDP (or similar) to it from Windows 8.1 Pro, and use my two 24" monitors for a better experience.  While I found Microsoft Remote Desktop in the Mac App Store, that's merely a client for connecting to other machines.  I need a server component on the MacBook to allow RDP connections and translate the desktop experience to the client on the calling machine.  Or, any alternative.  VNC might only provide the exact experience being served by the physical machine.  <answer278083> macOS does not support RDP out of the box. There does not seem to be a canonical best solution for getting it working, but you can see OS X RDP server application.  VNC is supported by macOS. Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongSharing/strong → strongScreen Sharing/strong → strongComputer Settings/strong and enable strongVNC viewers may control screen with password/strong.  <answer278101> Teamviewer is a much easier and simpler solution - https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/mac/  <comment349960> Microsoft remote Desktop in the App store is for macs to access Windows PCs. It doesn't work the other way around though there are hacks to do so. VNC works and there are other remote assistance web applications that do similar things. <comment349962> @Steve Your first sentence is a true fact, as already mentioned by OP in their question. I mention VNC in my answer. Am I missing something from your comment? <comment349976> @bmike Why did you add the link from my answer to the question? The link is part of answering the question, it seems odd to now be in the question? <comment350006> @grgarside Sign to be closed as duplicate, perhaps? It needed other edits, so I put that in as well. <comment350007> This is a viable alternative for many. There are some security ramifications though to have centralized credentials. Is TeamViewer capable of working peer to peer like RDC/VNC/ARD? That would be a good thing to put in the body of your answer. <comment350009> @bmike It's related, but not a duplicate, since this question asks for any possible solution and asks for alternatives such as VNC. What other edits? No other edits were made to the question.
