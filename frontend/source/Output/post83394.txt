After using McDonald's public wifi (via Bell), home wifi is connected but unusable <body> 10.8.2, 15" MBP.  I used my MBP at McDonald's and connected to their Bell wifi.  The user has to open their browser, attempt to go to any website, and get intercepted by the McDonalds's T&amp;C acceptance page.  This is probably the second or third time I've used it, but it's the first time it's caused an issue.  I arrived back home, connected to my home network, received a proper IP address from the router, but the internet is inaccessible.  Even worse, not even my router's IP address (or any IP address) will work.  Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary for DNS or proxy settings (all defaults), but I have a feeling my MBP hasn't forgotten whatever redirection method/DNS/proxy it was using at McD's.  I've have logged in/out, restarted the MBP, and turned wifi off/on.    <comment96001> Are your MBP WiFi in the same subnet as your home router's? <comment96002> @Globalnomad Do you mean the local IP address?  If so, yes.  I can also see the machine's MAC and IP in the list of connected devices when I login to the router from another computer. <comment96003> Since you mentioned there are no proxies settings, remaining possibilities are to clear the Safari cache, and to check on Little Snitch or like programs.
