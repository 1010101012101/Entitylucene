Mail.app no longer able to open Exchange calendar invitations after Sierra upgrade <body> I receive a lot of calendar invitations from Outlook/Exchange users.  Previously, they were correctly imported into Calendar when I clicked them in Mail, and I could Quick Look Attachment to inspect the invitation if I wanted to just look at it but not necessarily import it.  Now, neither of these work any longer.  Importing to Calendar stopped working already before I upgraded to Sierra (I was previously on Yosemite) but now the Quick Look Attachment menu item (when control-clicking on the ICS attachment) has also lost its functionality -- it opens a calendar view on the correct day, but it doesn't show me any actual event, or details of where or when the event should happen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZBUaIm.png" alt="Control-clicking brings up a menu with Quick Look Attachment" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8Gyem.png" alt="Quick Look shows the correct day but that&#39;s it"  (This particular event was scheduled for 16:00 to 17:30 on the 10th.)  The Open With... menu shows that the event will be opened with something called CalendarFileHandler.app which doesn't seem to exist according to Finder, but I'm not sure if that's what I should expect.  What can I do to troubleshoot this?  Switching to Exchange/Outlook is completely out of the question for me.
