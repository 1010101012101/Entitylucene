El Capitan 10.11.5 beta giving us the bird <body> On a MacBook Air running the latest El Capitan public beta (10.11.5) we're seeing very high CPU utilization (25 to 100+%) by the bird process.   We're seeing a number of errors (rather than a persistent one) some of the more common ones are:  precode[ERROR] 57226.692 [2016-05-07 22:23:40.422] upload/com.apple.CloudDocs     sync.transfer        BRCTransferBatchOperation.m:222         failed uploading 1 items (178 bytes) in com.apple.CloudDocs: &lt;CKError 0x7f8a6bf3ba40: "Partial Failure" (2/1011); "Failed to modify some records"; partial errors: {                 documentContent/817537A5-F0B6-4F4C-A7DB-C4C6204751D6:(com.apple.CloudDocs:__defaultOwner__) = &lt;CKError 0x7f8a6e021b60: "Asset File Modified" (17/3003); "generation counter mismatch (4 != 3)"&gt;  [ERROR] 58828.969 [2016-05-07 22:50:22.699] NSXPCConnection.user.580       xpc.client                 BRCXPCClient.m:808         nil error: &lt;NSError:0x7f8a6be86540(NSPOSIXErrorDomain:1) - {             NSDescription = "can't create container for (null)";         }&gt; /code/pre  The resulting CPU utilization makes the machine almost unusable, any suggestions for a solution short of turning off iCloud drive?  <comment291105> Not sure if beta software is something you will get much help with here, doesn't Apple have developer forums? You might, anyway, try turning off iCloud Drive and turning to back on so it re-download's everything (backup first)? <comment291129> @kal-al This is the official **public** beta that anyone can try.
