How to Import photo from screensaver Mac <body> I have transferred a photo from camera to the Mac and it is  stored in screen saver. I couldn't find any photo in iPhoto or in the library.   If you can please help me how to import photos from screen saver.    <answer243971> Open the screen saver preference pane and see what folder has the files. If you can locate that, open photos and import from that location.   <comment300530> All of the screen savers with ability to use custom photos take the photos from either an iPhoto Library or a folder. Have you checked System Preferences to see where the photos are?
