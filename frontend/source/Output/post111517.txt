Following OSX 10.9 upgrade, Console App won't tail after waking from sleep <body> I use Console.App to tail log files. However, after upgrading to Mavericks, once my MBP wakes from sleep, the app won't refresh automatically. It works fine when I first launch the app.  If I click Refresh, it will bring the log up to date. Disabling and then enabling Now has the same effect, but it will not continue to tail. If I close the app and reopen it, it works fine again.  Any ideas?  <comment167893> Mine does this as well. And not necessarily after sleep. All the time. :( <comment167922> @Fuzzy76 I switched to Terminal: `tail -F MyLogFile.txt`
