how to change music tonality in runtime? <body> On windows usualy for karaoke purpose some audio cards provide possibility to change tonality on fly, is it possible under Mac ?   Is ther any additional software which can do it ? or maybe terminal command ?  <answer83090> Have a look at Capo. From their Website:      Pitch Adjustment      Capo lets you adjust the pitch of your songsâ€”so you can change their   key or fine tune them to match your instrument.   <comment95786> It means that I can do it only for particular song, which will play in that app. But I would like to have it in system wide area <comment95787> yeah with capo you can only adjust it for the currently loaded song. <comment95788> but I'm looking something system wide solution :( <comment100406> Just saw this post http://evolver.fm/2013/03/19/how-to-equalize-mac-for-itunes-spotify-everything-else/ and thought of your question... Haven't tried this myself but it looks like you might get close with Sunflower and AU Lab.
