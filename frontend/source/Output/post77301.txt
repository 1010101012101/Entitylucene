Mail account sync via iTunes not working <body> I recently switched from Sparrow.app back to Mail.app and added a whole bunch of accounts. Now I am trying to sync them with my iPhone 5 via iTunes 11, since I am everything but keen on adding them manually in the iPhone settings.  But iTunes seems unable to find my accounts:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/TxuUJ.png" alt="Fetch"   So how can I fix this?  <answer86213> Looks like this was an ordinary bug, it's working now (iTunes 11.0.2 + iOS 6.0.2)  <comment99471> Awesome answer - thanks so much for returning and explaining what was needed to resolve it. <comment99488> I'm smelling sarcasm... <comment99489> Actually no. As a moderator - I see hundreds of short answers that don't answer things as well as hundreds of abandoned questions where [you know the person](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/36322/iphoto-opens-with-spinning-beach-ball-and-wont-stop) has found a fix and never returned to answer. No sarcasm - just appreciation for a small gesture on your part. <comment99505> Oh! Well thank you then :)
