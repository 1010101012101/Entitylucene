Simple electronics circuit simulation software for Mac <body> I want to learn how basic electronic components work and test some basic sensor output etc. My circuits are really simple so i don't need any fancy stuff.  I think MacSpice is CLI so it's too hard for me, i really need GUI app since i know hardly nothing about electronic circuits.  Which app lists electronic components with real names like "resistor 200" and don't use cryptic component codes which are hard to newbie?  <answer114454> This is one of a kind App http://icircuitapp.com/  It has IPad app as well. with simulation capablities  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WxG0G.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment134121> Why not improve this to explain what specific problem you are trying to solve or why a free circuit simulator from the maker community isn't a good place to start.
