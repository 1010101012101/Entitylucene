iphone 4s did not work after trying to upgrade from ios 5 to ios 6 unsuccessfully <body> my iphone 4s was with ios 5.0 and already jailbreak when purchased,  I just tried to upgrade it to 6.13, on it own (which is I did not hook up my iphone with my computer nor iTunes at that time),  After a while, my iphone screen asks me to connect my iphone to iTunes, so I connect it to my computer, but then, the worst thing happened  ITunes says it detected my iphone is in recovery mode, and I must restore my iphone to its original setting before it can be used with iTunes.  It is a nightmare, I don't want to lose all my data, messages, pics.  Can anyone help?  Many thanks.  <answer148974> Have you already tried to kick off your iPhone from recovery mode? This could be done with programs such as Tiny Umbrella or ReiBoot.  <comment175474> No, because I didn't know what to do. Now I will try Tiny Umbrella. Thanks.
