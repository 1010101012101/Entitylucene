Will restoration back to older iOS initialize apps, contacts and all other things? <body> I have an iPhone with iOS 10 but want to get this back to iOS 9.3.2.  I already downloaded an .ipsw file for the OS and ready to restore.  The button I would click says 'initialize iPhone' in Korean; don't know what this exactly says in English... It's on the right side of 'check updates', beneath the text 'iOS 10.0.2' and 'iPhone software is up to date'.  After clicking that 'initialize iPhone' holding alt-option key, iTune prompts message 'iTunes will delete iPhone and restore with iOS 9.3.2 ...'  I don't want all my date in the phone lost. May I restore it?  +says this question might be duplicate.. I have no problem choosing what version of iOS firmware to use. I just want to know whether restoring my iPhone to older version will result in initialization of the whole phone.  <comment322228> In response to your edit, the "no problem choosing what version" *is* a problem, because you can't just choose. Therefore this question is moot. <comment322230> What @grgarside is saying is that in order to install iOS, Apple has to still be signing the version of software that you are trying to install. iOS 9.3.x is no longer being signed (with the exception of devices that cannot upgrade to iOS 10), so you are no longer able to downgrade to it. In response to your specific question, you cannot downgrade and then restore a backup from a later version of iOS. You would either need to restore a backup from the version you are installing or earlier, or set it up as a new phone.
