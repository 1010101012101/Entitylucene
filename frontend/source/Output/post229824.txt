How can I hide an existing user - El Cap <body> I found commands about how to create a user that is hidden,  codesudo dscl . create /Users/USERNAME IsHidden 1/code  but how can I hide an existing user?  <answer229830> The command codesudo dscl . create /Users/username IsHidden 1/code doesn't really create a full-fledged user. The user misses an UID and a PGID and some more attributes.  Instead it creates a "rump user" with a new emNative Attribut Type/em: IsHidden with the value 1.  You can use the very same command for any existing user and strongadd/strong the IsHidden attribute with the values 0|1 though and after a restart the user account will be hidden in the login screen as well as in fast user switching (and in the System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups) if the value is set to 1.  Users with an UID â‰¤ 500 are hidden by default!
