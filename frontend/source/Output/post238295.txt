Installing ffmpeg with homebrew? <body> I am trying to install ffmpeg and it's libraries with homebrew on a mac running osx (El Capitain).  The installation completes however its seems only ffmpeg is installed and not ffprobe or drawtext.  I tried reinstalling with this command:  precodebrew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-libass --with-libvo-aacenc --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openjpeg --with-opus --with-rtmpdump --with-schroedinger --with-speex --with-theora --with-tools /code/pre  ..but I get this  precodeWarning:ffmpeg-3.0.2 already installed, it's just not linked /code/pre  What am I missing? I have tried deleting and retrying the installation but the problem persists.  <answer238680> To answer this question, you need to link up codeffmpeg/code, but I'd run some housecleaning too.  First remove ffmpeg from your system:  precode$ brew uninstall ffmpeg /code/pre  Now update all your brew packages and references.  precode$ brew update $ brew upgrade --all $ brew cleanup /code/pre  Now install codeffmpeg/code on your system, and link it up:  precode$ brew install ffmpeg --force $ brew link ffmpeg /code/pre  Now you should be good to go.  <comment292189> `brew link ffmpeg`? <comment292199> Solved. That gave me <comment292200> brew link --overwrite ffmpeg fixed it. Thanks. <comment342433> Works for me; note: on OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, `ffmpeg` has no --force directive: `Warning: ffmpeg: this formula has no --force option so it will be ignored!`
