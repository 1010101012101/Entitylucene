Receive SMS with iMessage on multiple Macs <body> I have 2 Macbooks, one old, one new. Both are configured to be able to receive the SMS of my iPhone and cell number through iMessage.  However, strongonly/strong the old Macbook is receiving SMS, while both old and new Macbook receive regular iMessages configured with my Apple iCloud ID.  When I got the new Macbook, I stopped using the old one, and could receive SMS with the new one freshly configured. At one point, when I used the old Macbook strongagain/strong after some time, the new Macbook stopped receiving SMS altogether.  Is there maybe a limit to how many Macs can receive the same SMS through one iPhone?  <answer273453> Have you checked the settings on both devices? Message settings on iOS and the settings window (CMD + ,) in messages on your new Mac?  Text message forwarding happens on the following iOS settings page for iMessage:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/03xTu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment343775> Have you checked the settings on both devices?

I wonder how I missed that in the settings jungle..
