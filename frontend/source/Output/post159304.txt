How to connect 24" Apple Display to HDMI output of Mac Mini 2011? <body> Trying to have two monitors connected to Mac Mini mid-2011. It has one Mini DisplayPort and one HDMI outputs.  I have 27" monitor connected to Mini Display port of the Mac Mini mid-2011. I was going to connect 24" Apple display to it, but can't find anywhere on internet male-HDMI/female-Mini DisplayPort adapter.  There are the other way around (male DP to female HDMI) available, but not the one to connect 24" display as a second one.  I was thinking about finding a male HDMI–to something in between–to female Mini DisplayPort cables, but can't figure out what that "something in between" could be that would carry on digital signal.  Any advices?  <answer159306> Unfortunately, adapters like that don't exist, AFAIK.  That is, you can't just convert from HDMI to DisplayPort via a simple cable. The [Mini] DisplayPort to HDMI adapters aren't just cables, they contain IC's that provide an HDMI interface. I don't know of any such adapter that works in the other direction.
