Why does x11 force a maximum window height? <body> When I open an x11 window via ssh on my Mac, I cannot drag the window wherever I want on the screen - there is some invisible border / vertical bar that I can't seem to cross.  How can I resize and move the window like I would any other?  If this isn't possible, why not?  <comment173626> I've only had experience running remote X apps on a local X server. For example, running X11 on my MacBook and ssh with X forwarding to a remote server. In that scenario, the local X server defines the display geometry, so I've not seen that problem. <comment173627> That's the scenario I'm dealing with, so I'm not sure what's causing the issue.
