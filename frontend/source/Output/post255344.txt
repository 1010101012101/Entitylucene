Delete photo on iPhone, keeps showing up in library <body> Well, it's in the title. I have a photo that I keep trying to permanently delete on my iPhone 6s running iOS 10 with iCloud photo library (though this problem occurred with iOS 9). I delete it, clear deleted photos, and a little while later it's back on the phone. Very strangely, it doesn't appear on Photos on my Mac or on iCloud.com! It's driving me crazy. How do I get this photo to stay deleted forever?  <comment318029> When you say "it's back on the phone," where precisely does it show back up? Under All Photos or somewhere else? <comment318055> @tubedogg it shows up roughly where it was before in All Photos. It's not right away, usually within a day or so.
