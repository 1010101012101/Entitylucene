Using Back To My Mac to access other computers on my home network remotely <body> Is it possible to get non-mac machines, particularly, freebsd to be registered as file shares in back to my mac?  I can currently use btmm to access macs on my home network remotely, but I am hoping to be able to access my home server using btmm so I can do time machine backups and access critical files, without having to install and configure openvpn.
