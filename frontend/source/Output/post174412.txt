Removing camera button on iPhone lock screen <body> How to remove the camera button on the iPhone lock screen without removing the camera from the springboard  I don't want to allow people without access to take pictures using my phone (pictures are shared automatically by iCloud) But in the same time, I want to be able to use the camera from the springboard.  I'm searching for a strongnative/strong solution under iOS 8.x or later  <answer174420> The only way this can be done is by using Settings  General  Restrictions to disable the use of the camera completely. A side effect is that FaceTime is also disabled.  There is no other mechanism built-in to do what you want.  <answer186122> You can just disable access to any functions from the lock screen by going to "Settings"  "Control Center" and then turn off access from lock screen.  <answer186129> There is no native solution for what you want. But to answer your problem of automatically sharing pictures to icloud, you can disable the feature of sharing automatically.   precodeSettings -&gt; icloud -&gt; photos -&gt; turn off photo sharing /code/pre  This may not be a complete solution, but can reduce the risk of sharing everything. Hope it helps.   <answer189143> There is no native solution for what you want.

There is no native solution to this. You can always turn off the camera settings though  <comment205363> You might get better answers if you indicate whether solutions requiring a jailbreak would be ok for you. <comment205364> I'm searching for a native solution only <comment205370> another side effect is that all your applications using the camera don't work anymore <comment219682> This only controls the presence or absence of the Control Center on the lock screen, and does not answer the OPs question. <comment224195> 1) this answer already exists and 2) please don't spam us <comment244083> This is the same as the accepted answer... but with less detail <comment251030> Complain at the Genius Bar?
