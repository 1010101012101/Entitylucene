Late 2013 Macbook Pro "Virtual Whole Disk" in red issue in diskUtilities <body> I was attempting to bootcamp Windows 10 on my MBP and was encountering when installing windows issues. I was in diskutil and I erased the partition that was created via bootcamp and things went down from there. I tried a work around but still haven't been able to resolve this issue. Is there another alternative? I believe it was something about the corestorage resize. I would greatly appreciate helps in advance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sjCnI.png" alt="DiskUtil"  Sils-MacBook-Pro:~ sil$ diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 97CAFDD2-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx     =========================================================     Name:         -none-     Status:       Initializing     Size:         0 B (0 B)     Free Space:   -none-     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 88D046CB-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx         ----------------------------------------------------         Index:    0         Disk:     disk0s4         Status:   Failed         Size:     454912180224 B (454.9 GB)  Sils-MacBook-Pro:~ sil$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                44.4 GB    disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:          Apple_CoreStorage                         454.4 GB   disk0s4    5:                 Apple_Boot                         650.0 MB   disk0s5  Sils-MacBook-Pro:~ sil$ diskutil cs resizeStack Usage:  diskutil coreStorage resizeStack         lvUUID|MountPoint|DiskIdentifier|DeviceNode [pvUUID] size         [part1Format part1Name part1Size part2Format part2Name part2Size          part3Format part3Name part3Size ...] Resize both a logical volume and one of its underlying physical volumes in a single operation. A single physical volume is always chosen for the underlying shrink or grow, even if the logical volume's logical volume group is backed by more than one physical volume. If you do not specify a particular physical volume, then one is chosen for you. Note that if this is a grow operation, this verb is limited by the physical volume's partition's room to grow. Specifying zero as the size asks for an "automatic" grow-to-fill operation. If this is a shrink operation, you can optionally request that new partitions be created in the newly-formed free space gap in the partition map. Again, note that this only resizes one of the underlying physical volumes; if you need more sophistication in managing your topology, you should use the separate physical and logical volume resize verbs.

I want the space I originally had back.  Thanks, Sil
