Can I assign a keyboard shortcut to bring up the Mac OS X Login Window? <body> I’d like to assign an “Every Application” keyboard shortcut to bring up the login window, for when I step away from my computer. Is there a way to do this? (Lion-only methods are fine.)  <answer18086> Press Shift-Cmd+Q. Make sure that "Reopen windows when logging back in" is checked. Press enter.   Thanks to Lion, when you log back in, everything will look the same.  <answer18375> This may not answer your question entirely, but at least it is a step in the right direction.  ol liOpen Keychain Access located in the Utilities Folder inside the Applications Folder./li liOpen Keychain Access preferences and check the box "Show keychain status in the menu bar." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LIFO5.png" alt="Check &quot;Show keychain status in the menu bar&quot;"/li liFrom the Lock icon in the menu bar, choose "Lock Screen."/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/flufT.png" alt="From the Lock icon in the menu bar, choose &quot;Lock Screen.&quot;"  <answer41953> I realise that this thread is probably quite old by now, but for all the options that has been given here, the simplest way has not been discussed.  Apple allows you to lock your screen with a keyboard shortcut. You don't have to create one, there is one built right in to OSX — via the “Require password after sleep or screensaver” feature.  Here is how to use it:  ol liMake sure that you have “Require password after sleep or screensaver begins” set to “immediately”./li /ol  To do this, follow these steps:  ol liOpen System Preferences /li liClick on Security (on Lion, “Security &amp; Privacy”)/li liGo to the General tab/li liIf you don't already have one, put a tick in the box next to "Require password after sleep or screen saver begins"/li liSet the time interval to “immediately”/li liExit System Preferences/li /ol  When now when you want to lock your Mac, simply use the keyboard shortcut   kbdCtrl ⌃/kbd + kbdShift ⇧ /kbd + kbdEject ⏏ /kbd or kbdCtrl ⌃/kbd + kbdShift ⇧ /kbd + kbdPower /kbd  <answer41986> You could also set an Applescript to click the "Login Window" menu item after a certain amount of time:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jkNw7.jpg" alt="Login Window..."  If you want to navigate the menubar, the script goes something like this:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      (* Login menu has to be the last! *)    tell application "System Events"     tell process "SystemUIServer"       set n to number of menu bar items of menu bar 1       tell menu bar item n of menu bar 1         click         repeat with i from 1 to 10           try             if name of menu item i of front menu contains "Login Window" then               click menu item i of front menu               exit repeat             end if           end try         end repeat       end tell     end tell   end tell    return input end run /code/pre  <answer41988> Another way to log out to the fast user switching screen is to assign a shortcut to this shell command:  code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend/code  If you have the Alfred Powerpack, you can assign a shortcut to the lock action, but just typing "lock" doesn't take that much longer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CzeF0.png" alt=""  <answer75131> If you want to assign kbdalt ⌥/kbd+kbdcmd ⌘/kbd+kbdL/kbd to lock screen strongwithout installing any programs, in 5 minutes/strong, I suggest you doing these three steps:  ol liCreate a emService/em in Automator and set "Service receives selected" to "no input" instead of "text"./li li(Still in Automator) add 'Run AppleScript' (search on the left "apple" then double-click).br In the script in place of  (* Your script goes here *) you copy-paste:  codedo shell script "'/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession' -suspend"/codebr Save and exit. (You can name your service "Lock Screen".)/li liOpen System Preferences, Keyboard then in Keyboard Shortcuts tab and under Services you will find your service "Lock Screen" towards the bottom of the list.br Now, click on "none" next to "Lock Screen" to assign strong⌥⌘ L/strong to your service. Actually I suggest rather strong⌃⌥⌘ L/strong because strong⌥⌘ L/strong is assigned in Finder./li /ol  Done.   (For step 2 cudos goes to Lauri Ranta!)  <answer75141> You can use strongBetter Touch Toolsup (link)/sup/strong to create a strongmulti-touch gesture/strong or a strongshortcut/strong to get to the login screen:  h3Multi-touch gesture/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QdBq9.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3Keyboard Shortcut/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IKVgD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer212670> Wow this has been going on a while… But after trying all these different suggestions I found the easiest way for emme/em that I don't see mentioned here and elsewhere but is sorta common sense to me now that I think of it…  ol liSet the require password after sleep or screensaver to "immediately"/li liEnable "hot corners" and select a corner to either "start screen saver" or "put display to sleep"./li /ol  Then all you have to do is simply slide your cursor all the way into said corner and your screen saver will start of the display goes to sleep and then when you move the mouse again you will be at the login screen!    No scripts, no menu bar short cuts, no key sequences, just a simple swipe of the trackpad!   This works wether you have the corner set to screen saver, sleep display, or close the lid.  <answer272867> There's only one way to do this, if you want to invoke the Login screen from a keyboard hotkey shortcut. It requires using the built-in Automator application in Mac OS. Here's the article on how to do it:  http://www.macyourself.com/2013/01/27/how-to-lock-your-mac-screen-with-a-keyboard-shortcut/comment-page-2/#comment-6991  <comment19775> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11286/how-can-i-show-the-login-window-after-a-period-of-inactivity <comment19782> Not a bad workaround. I think it causes browser tabs to reload though, so not ideal if say you’re on a 3G internet connection. <comment19799> Yes it does cause everything to reload, which also may take some time depending how many apps you were running when you logged out. But then again other solutions require complex scripting setups, so this is as easy as it gets ;) <comment19802> Sure. Have you got any links to the alternatives? <comment19805> Scripting Fast User Switching comes to mind: http://superuser.com/questions/44433/create-a-keyboard-shortcut-for-fast-user-switching-in-mac-os-x <comment20071> I have yet to find a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to the menu bar item and/or Keychain Access menu bar menu. <comment20355> yeah, I think there is a way to get Shift-F7 to be a shortcut for assigning keyboard focus to the menu bar. If the keychain status icon is the leftmost icon in there, then it’s nearly a keyboard shortcut for the lock screen (i.e. Shift-F7, down arrow, enter). It’s a bit cumbersome though, and you have to keep the keychain status icon as the leftmost one in the menu bar. <comment20366> I'm writing on my phone right now, so I can't find it for you, but I know there are ways to AppleScript menu bar items. Maybe this can help? http://goo.gl/0peFU <comment20368> aha, excellent, cheers. <comment20463> Alrighty, for the record, I went with this great answer: http://superuser.com/questions/45740/fast-user-switching-apple-menu/46308#46308 <comment24282> Common utilities like [launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/) allow a quick keyboard shortcut to secure your session without actually logging out or having the screensaver be password protected. <comment47648> Not bad at all. Can be a bit sub-optimal if you’ve got Safe Sleep enabled and you want to unlock your machine soon after locking it, as it can still be writing the contents of your RAM to disk. <comment47651> Just use this with a Automator Service and a shell script Action, Then assign a hotkey in the System prefs. <comment47665> This is the FIRST not annoying effect of the Saved Application State feature I heard of... <comment87201> Hi Davies! Did you manage to complete the script? <comment256786> Sure. That’s not a keyboard shortcut though. <comment256787> As noted on http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18365/is-there-a-similarly-fast-alternative-to-crtl-shift-eject-for-new-macbook-th, there’s now a built-in shortcut for this, ctrl+shift+power. <comment315301> Thx, friend, that was the only one normal solution IMHO <comment329774> This was the best solution I also exported it so all you have todo is install it : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20485770/Lock%20Screen.zip <comment342964> In general, links don't make great answers (the website behind the link could disappear, the link could change, etc). Could you edit your answer to summarise the steps required? <comment343000> “There's only one way to do this” — except there’s also [this way to do it](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/41953/1092).
