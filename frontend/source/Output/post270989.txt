Save an image (PNG) with annotations as a PDF <body> Is it possible to save an image that was annotated in Preview as a PDF file so I can edit it again later, even after restarting Preview?  <answer271171> You can always use File  "Export as PDF…" or even File  Print…  click PDF options in lower-left corner as a way to convert anything open in Preview to PDF. However, any annotations made to an image format such as PNG without converting will be flattened/rasterized when saved or converted to PDF and can't be edited. You will need to first convert the image to PDF  strongthen/strong annotate in order to be able to edit annotations later.
