How to restore system from network drive? <body> I have a 2014 MacBook Pro.  I want to restore my OS from a Time Machine backup which is on a shared network volume.  When I restart in recovery (Apple-Opt-R), it boots from internet, but if I try to restore from Time Machine backup, it fails to see the server where the shared volume is.   Do I need to log/mount the share somehow?  <answer162547> Recovery mode needs a netboot server (like OS X server app) to serve up that image.  You could set one up or you could copy the backup instance to a USB drive and connect it locally.  For netboot, I'd recommend deploy studio as your go to solution in terms of ease of use and robustness of the solution.  Also, if you just need user files and applications, you could do a clean install of the OS and then make a temporary user account and use migration assistant to copy the real user and files over once the Mac can run it's own OS to perform the network mount.  <answer162550> Prerequisites:    – admin account &amp; passwordbr – AFP/SMB-share &amp; server IP-address  ol liBoot the Computer to Recovery Mode./li liOpen Terminal in the Utilities menu/li liAt the prompt enter: codecd /Volumes/code/li liCreate a sub-directory in Volumes as a mount point for your time machine share:br codemkdir TimeMachine/code/li liEnter codecd TimeMachine/code/li liEnter codepwd/code. pwd should show /Volumes/TimeMachine/li liMount the network share with your admin loginname &amp; password:  precodemount -t afp afp://adminname:password@ServerIPAddress/ShareName /Volumes/TimeMachine /code/pre  If your password contains wonky characters like :@\/ use URL encoding to protect them/li liEnter: codels -la/code.

I actually tried klanomath's answer and failed, maybe because I have an encrypted backup on the network share. But might also have to do with a wrongful URL encryption.  However there is a much easier way. In this step:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bypb6.png" alt="enter image description here"  just reinstall your OS X.   After that is finished the migration assistant should popup or if it does not, one can create a user, login and then start the migration assistant by hand.   In the migration assistant:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7hzxq.png" alt="Migration Assistant"  choose "From a Mac, Time Machine backup, or startup disk". Click Continue, and choose "Other server". This will allow you to enter the address of the volume and it will ask you for the password, in case you used an encrypted backup.  After that you can choose what to recover. Beware, if the user you created after the installation has the same name as the one you used in the backup, there will be a conflict. You will then need to choose, whether you would like to keep delete the user or keep the data.   <comment190106> I actually tried all that previously ... but the `mount` command gives me this error: `mount_afp: AFPMountURL returned error -5023, errno is -5023` -- which it gives even when I try to mount when NOT in recovery. <comment190108> AH! I figured it out. My password has a \ in it ... so I need to quote the `afp:..` string. Hopefully that will work in recovery as well. <comment190111> @Ze'ev that's no good. do you have admin rights at the server? <comment190128> @Ze'ev i had no problem using this with a regular password (=not containing any "forbidden" chars like :@\/) <comment190373> Not sure what you're saying. My password DOES have a \ in it, so I put single quotes around the `afp://...` part of the command. And it worked. However, upon getting to the restore part, it said there was 930GB free on my HD, when there are only 215GB. That scared me. Any idea why? <comment190375> @Ze'ev the password hint wasn't directed directly to you ;-) i tested different passwords (containing : or @) and quoting/escaping didn't work. <comment190379> @Ze'ev What do you want to restore? The whole system? Probably it's better to ask a second question with some screenshots here at askdifferent. <comment190380> strange... It worked for me <comment190383> @Ze'ev i just test it again (in a VM) before i approve your edit... <comment198238> If I have my own folder at the root level of the drive, e.g. /media, will restoring from Time Machine erase that folder? <comment198239> @Ze'ev which drive do you mean? Your system drive? Your backup should contain this folder or it's no real backup! Or do want to revert to a much older version? <comment198240> Yes, system drive. I have a big /media folder which I do NOT backup with Time Machine. I could back it up if necessary, but was hoping there was a way to revert JUST the OS. <comment198241> You may restore single folders (eg /System /Library /bin /sbin /Applications /Users etc) which won't hurt your /media folder. <comment261693> I know this is rather old but if you do have any special characters (like `\ ` ) in your password, you may need to escape some or even all of them with... `\ ` (yep, a backslash :) ). So `\\ ` represents that single `\ ` in your password.
