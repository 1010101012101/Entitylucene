How to create a keyboard shortcut for Preview `Move To…` <body> Using App shortcuts in System Preferences - Keywords allows me to create a shortcut but it does not work when I try it in Preview.  I tried the following keybindings (which do not conflict with preview's bindings):  ⌥⌘M, ^⌥⌘M,  ⌥⌘K, ^⌥⌘K   <answer199989> If you don't apply it to "Preview" but to "All Applications" in "System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - App Shortcuts" any unused shortcut will work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5gYDr.png" alt="enter image description here"  and the resulting Preview menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8NY9B.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment240893> Move to ? Trash ? what are you trying to accomplish? you can not assign shortcuts for commands that do not exist in Preview. You can use Automator or schript and create a action, then assign a keyboard shortcut to that. <comment240907> @Buscar웃 The command "Move To…" **does** indeed exist in Preview... <comment240912> @klanomath I only have the "Move to Trash", but that is on Mavericks.
