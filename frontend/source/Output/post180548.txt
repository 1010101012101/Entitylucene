I know Corsair has mac compatible memory sticks strongbut/strong this one I mention is the only one I can get at my location.  From what I see the latency is a bit different: 11-11-11-28 instead of 11-11-11-30.  I really need to upgrade my RAM but can't get any of the "mac compatible" kits. :-/  <answer187027> Yes, it will work fine with Mac.   I have personal experience. I've tested out that configuration.  <comment214473> Actually the lover the number the better :) <comment214477> Ohh, that I "know" but my worry is that the mac will be "picky" and it will randomly fail etc <comment220985> How do you know? any references ? personal experience ? <comment221017> Personal experience. I've tested out that configuration.
