Collect results in for loop when run shell script <body> I try to collect results of "svn info" for selected folders by run shell script,like this:  precodefor f in "$@"; do     svn info $f | tee -a $log_file done /code/pre  But it's not work. How can I collect each result in for loop?  <answer264203> The problem is that "Automator" is not support some encoding such as GB18030.Once your file name encoding with them, they can't be convert to utf-8 , it returns a error.  <comment329131> Does it work if you run it directly in Terminal? What does "does not work" mean exactly: error message, empty log file, no output? What do you intend to do with the collected result? <comment329133> It works with a specified pathï¼Œbut not work in the loop @patrix <comment329135> Where does `$log_file` point to? If this is a relative reference (or just a filename), you may not have write permissions in the directory the script is running in. Same for the project names in `$@`. <comment329138> A "log.txt" already exists, I'm sure about write permissions. @patrix <comment329139> $@ is the input of selected folders in  "Finder.app" of "Run Shell Script"  in Automator <comment329140> Use standard debugging techniques then by adding `echo` statements wherever it makes sense :-) <comment331065> Can you add the error message *to the question*? I suspect that the issue is with the shell, not with Automator. <comment332652> My mistake, It's not caused by utf-8, but some filename with encoding such as "Chinese(GB18030)", it's can't be convert to utf-8. @patrix
