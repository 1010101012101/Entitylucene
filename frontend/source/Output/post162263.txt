Can you change the storage location of Conversation History for Mac Lync? <body> I know the history is stored in code/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Microsoft Lync History/code.  Does anyone know if it's possible to change where it's stored? I'd like to save conversations to a cloud storage directory.  <answer162291> How about moving that directory to Drop Box, or a similar cloud-synced space, and then symlinked that path to your cloud directory?  You can create the link with the Finder 'Make Alias' command under File, or use Terminal to create a link with 'ln'.  The original directory goes in your cloud directory, and the alias goes back in /Users//Documents/Microsoft User Data/  This process is standard for DropBox, I assume it would work with other services too.
