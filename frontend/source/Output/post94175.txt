How to enable sticky keys on a Mac <body> I've seen this option in one Ubuntu machine and I want to replicate it in my mac:  Hold a Key for 2 second to activate it.  What I have seen is this: Hold down a Key for 2 second (kbdShift/kbd for example). Then write something and the written text was as if the kbdShift/kbd key is pressed (and it acts like the kbdCaps Lock/kbd pressed). Then the key is pressed one time to deactivate it.  Is it possible to achieve this on a mac too?  <answer94177> This function is called sticky keys. You can activate as follows on a Mac:  ol liOpen System Preferences./li liType in codesticky/code in the search bar and hit enter./li liTick codeEnable sticky keys/code./li /ol  OR    ol liOpen System Preferences./li liGo to codeAccessibility/code./li liGo to codeKeyboard/code./li liTick codeEnable sticky keys/code./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8la2Z.png" alt="Sticky Keys option screenshot"  <answer94206> One problem with sticky keys is that there is a short delay before sticky keys get registered. If for example you press shift and z immediately after it, z is not capitalized. See this question.  KeyRemap4MacBook has its own implementation of sticky keys which doesn't have that issue.  <comment110406> For the Shift button behaviour you describe you can also just press Caps Lock. <comment110412> yes, of coursethe question is more general
