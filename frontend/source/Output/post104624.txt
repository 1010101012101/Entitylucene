Apply rules to messages in mailbox <body> I created some rules in codeMail 6.6/code application.  Now, I want to apply these rules on my existing mails in mailbox, not just to the inbox, that is going to my mailbox after creation of the rules.  How can I achieve this?   <answer104629> To apply the rules to existing messages, just select the mailbox and use "Apply Rules" from the "Message" menu. Or use the shortcut kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdL/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQqaQ.png" alt="Screenshot: Apply Rules"
