iPhone 6 started making random faint pinging sounds <body> My iPhone 6 (iOS 10.3.2) recently started making faint random pinging sounds. This happens several times every few minutes and doesn't appear related to anything, as far as I can tell.  I performed a hard restart but it had no effect. None of my notifications were set to sound only and the pinging sound is faint, having a volume lower than my notifications. Does anyone have a clue about why this is happening?   <comment365228> Does the pinging is from the horn or the iphone hardware? <comment365231> The pinging comes from speaker I'm pretty sure. <comment365235> How much disk do you leave? if the disk is almost full maybe it will get this issue. <comment365245> Good thought but I have 28 GB free. Almost half. So I don't think its storage problem.
