How do I change geolocation of photos in the Photo app? <body> The thing is, there is a bunch of photos I've taken that are referred at the wrong location.  For example: there is a picture of my dad that was taken at my home in Barueri, Brazil and the Photo app says that it was taken at Ar Riyad, Saudi Arabia  Lots of other photos are located in places like Africa and Western Asia, places that I've never been before.  Is there a way to correct it?  <answer209210> That information is based on the GPS information in the EXIF metadata, and cannot be changed in the Photos app.  If you export the photo to your Desktop, then open it in strongPreview/strong, you should be able to kbdcmd/kbdkbdI/kbd and select the 'More Info' tab (the 'i' with a circle around it) and check the 'GPS' tab to see if the information is correct. If you want to change the GPS coordinates, there are a number of third-party tools to do this – but I generally use ExifTool.  <answer209213> I do not know a way to edit the location of photos on the iPhone but with El Capitan you can now edit them in the Desktop Photo App:  ol liselect the one or more photos/li lipress kbdcmd/kbdkbdI/kbd or use Window - Info/li licheck/enter and/or edit the location information under Location/li /ol  <answer252855> Not sure if you already solved  Koredoko is what you are searching for  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/koredoko-exif-and-gps-viewer/id286765236?mt=8  <comment252210> Wow, that is seriously off! They were taken on your iPhone? Are you sure there isn't a root problem to deal with future images? <comment252270> Which version of Mac OS are you on? Location capabilities in Photos have changed with El Capitan, if I remember correctly. <comment314616> Welcome to Ask Different!
