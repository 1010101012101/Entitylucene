Where does this "delayed send" capability in Mail come from? <body> My only plugins as far as I know are Mail Act-On and MailTags. Does this functionality comes from them? I could not find anything on their website. Any other idea?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x5H2e.png" alt="New message window"  <answer118728> It looks like you must be using the Mail Act-On 3 Mavericks beta.  They have a link on their page to it and some what's new info.     What is new in Mail Act-On 3      Mavericks Support Mail Act-On 3 now supports OS X 10.8 and 10.9 New   interface Reply Templates Composer options including setting delivery   times specifying outbox rules to apply specifying archive mailbox for   sent mail   <comment138547> Thanks I had missed it as I was going through their website !
