OS X 10.10.. . backup program does not recognize/read prior backups <body> The backup program does not recognize data I copied to a new 3T TimeCapsule disk. When I select the folder containing the data, the program tells me there are no prior backups, but there are over 875MB of data there.   What do I need to do to fix this?  <comment225151> You should just be able to tell Time Machine which drive to use - it ought to figure it out from there, so long as it can see backups.backupdb at the top level. <comment225264> That's the problem. I selected the drive TimeMachine should use and when ready to start a new backup, it shows there are not prior backups although I know the backup folder contains 875MB of data. The program can't figure it out. The backup folder was copied as a sub folder - it is not at the top level; when copying it, the system did not allow to put it at the top. <comment225302> Pretty sure it wants to see it at the top <comment225347> As well as needing to be at the top, a simple drag and drop in Finder will mess it up.  I take it you mean 875GB - 875MB is a very small backup.
