Terminal - don't require password for shell script to run <body> I am running Yosemite 10.10.5 and I have a shell script which I want to use to toggle whether my wifi connections run through tor or not. This uses the codenetworksetup/code a couple of times and so asks for my password each time I run or cancel it.   Is there a way to make a shell script run without requiring my password each time?  Thanks!  <answer206722> You can add a rule to the code/etc/sudoers/code file to give your user access rights to codenetworksetup/code without a password.  ol liNote the user name of the user account which should be allowed to run the command (you can get the user name by running codewhoami/code in Terminal)/li liLog in as an admin user/li liOpen Terminal/li licodeVISUAL=nano sudo visudo/code - opens the sudoers file in a kind of friendly editor/li liJump to the bottom/li liAdd  precodeUSERID-FROM-STEP1 ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/networksetup /code/pre  followed by an empty line(!)/li liSave and quit/li /ol  You should now be able to run codenetworksetup/code as the user from step 1 without a password prompt by simply entering codesudo networksetup/code.  <comment249163> You can edit the `sudoers` file to give your user access to `networksetup` without requiring a password. Is `networksetup`  the only command requiring `sudo`? <comment249166> yep. would you mind elaborating on what and how to edit? <comment249169> Need to get in front of a Mac first to make sure I get it right, stay tuned :-) <comment249179> what if the user is just me? would it be the name of my home directory then? <comment249185> @river_jones To get your proper userid just enter `whoami` in the Terminal.  Usually (but not necessarily since you may have renamed your user folder or your user previously) it's the same name as your home folder in /Users. <comment249231> On an unrelated note, I was just curious and replaced `nano` with `subl` (I use sublime for development) and this just opened a new blank file (like `touch`). Why is it that `nano` opens the "correct" /etc/subdoers.tmp` but `subl` doesn't? <comment249234> Btw, I didn't realize that as an admin I could just add `sudo` to my `networksetup` calls and it's sufficient to suppress password confirmation. But this is useful for allowing the same for non-admin's. Thanks for your time and help!
