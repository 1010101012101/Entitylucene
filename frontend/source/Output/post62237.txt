View PDF on iPad from Windows 7 over WiFi <body> I have a home fileserver running Windows 7. I have a directory with PDF files. I want to view the PDF files on my iPad 2 over WiFi and not locally store them on the iPad. Is there any app which can help me? I tried to read the Goodreader docs and could not find much information without buying it on the iPad. Can someone help?  <answer62285> Run a web-server on it. Look here and choose one you would like or even here for smaller ones  Then put PDF in web server directory or designate current one in webserver configuration.  After that you'll be able to use just Safari to read that PDFs  <comment71885> GoodReader will copy/sync the pdfs to your iPad for reading. If you can run a web server on your Windows box, you might just be able to use Safari. <comment71897> Does that fileserver expose any shares through particular services? Do you have access to the file server to make adjustments? As in, could you start a web server or a different share on that machine?
