Transfer disk image from one MacBook Air to another <body> I'd like to migrate into a new MacBook Air I bought this week, from the previous version of MacBook Air. SSD size is the same.  Can I somehow image my older SSD and "move" it to the new SSD?  <answer54283> If both MacBook Airs have Thunderbolt, the easiest way would be to use Migration Assistant over Thunderbolt:  ol liGet a Thunderbolt cable (borrow or buy)./li liBoot the old Air into Target Disk Mode (hold down kbdT/kbd while booting)./li liConnect the MacBook Airs via the Thunderbolt cable./li liOn initial boot of the new Air, you'll have the option of using Migration Assistant off another Mac. /li liSelect the types of items you want to copy./li liWait while Migration Assistant does its magic./li liemEt voil√†/em, your new Air is just like your old one except newer and faster./li /ol  <comment62134> @ronM. Migration Assistant (in default mode) will migrate everything: apps, preferences, your user folder, random stuff you've got scattered around the root directory, remembered WiFi networks, etc. It'll get everything and (in my experience) you won't even have to re-authorize apps (from the likes of Adobe or Microsoft) that have license keys. It's really quite amazing. <comment142423> @Aras There's a Migration Assistant in /Applications/Utilities. <comment250585> You do not need Thunderbolt. You can use an ethernet connection, wired or wi-fi. You can even use a Time Machine backup to an external drive but it will take longer.
