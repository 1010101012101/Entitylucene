How to kill the popup in OS X when a disk can't be ejected <body> With ZFS-OSX, sometimes when I try to force eject my HDD and it's failing, the following popup appears on my screen – floating on the top with strongall the buttons grayed out/strong – and no possibility to close it no matter what I do:     strongThe disk "WD_1TB" wasn't ejected because one or more programs may be using it./strong       To eject the disk immediately, click the Force Eject button.          kbdCancel/kbd    kbdForce Eject…/kbd   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/apAvM.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's quite annoying. It even appears with full-screen applications.   In Linux, I could easily run codexkill/code, but it doesn't work on OS X.  I've tried  - 'Force Quit…', but it's not appearing on the list and restarting Finder doesn't help.  Any suggestions how to get rid of it without being forced to reboot?  <answer113613> The process is strongUnmountAssistantAgent/strong, therefore can be killed using Activity Monitor, or by running:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codekillall UnmountAssistantAgent /code/pre
