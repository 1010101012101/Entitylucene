What is the Correct 'pf' Syntax for an 'iptables' Port Redirection Rule <body> I am looking to implement a rule like the following codeiptables/code rule on my Mac, to redirect traffic from my development workstation (hosting a development copy of a Ruby on Rails project) to another host on my LAN that is running the PostgreSQL database server. emWithout having to change the codedatabase.yml/code config file on my local copy of the code/em:  precodeiptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -d 127.0.0.1 -p tcp --destination-port 5432 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.104:5432 /code/pre  <answer198440> After some brief googling, I came up with this, which seems to work great.  precodeecho "rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to 127.0.0.1 port 5432 -&gt; 192.168.1.104 port 5432" | sudo pfctl -ef - /code/pre  I am not sure that it is the best way, which is why I am posting here.  I would love to learn the best way to do this on Mac.  I did get this warning, though I don't know that it actually flushed any rules:  precodepfctl: Use of -f option, could result in flushing of rules present in the main ruleset added by the system at startup. See /etc/pf.conf for further details.  No ALTQ support in kernel ALTQ related functions disabled pfctl: pf already enabled /code/pre  From the man page, code-f/code is just telling it to parse the file, which I am sending in via codestdin/code.  Any discussion, improvements, or hints would be great!
