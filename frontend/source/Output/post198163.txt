How to start Tunnelblick VPN connection via Terminal <body> I can connect/disconnect using the Tunnelblick app. How do I connect via the command line?  code/Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/openvpnstart start ???/code  How do I determine the parameters to pass?  <answer198165> A possibly better idea than messing around with openvpn directly (Tunnelblick is basically just a fancy GUI around it) would be to use an Applescript, something that can definitely be launched from the terminal (i.e. with codeosascript/code)  Example taken from here:  precodetell application "Tunnelblick"     connect "Company_VPN"     get state of first configuration where name = "Company_VPN"     repeat until result = "CONNECTED"         delay 1         get state of first configuration where name = "Company_VPN"     end repeat end tell /code/pre  You'd write this into the Script Editor, save it, and then you could launch it from the terminal with codeosascript/code, or by double clicking on the script.  <comment237117> As @Mikey T.K. said, it would be easier to control it with apple script, you can see the dictionary to  see all commands. You directly run openvpn but then you might miss a option or something. I have a LaunchBar Action to control VPN with that, if you're interested. <comment238521> Use the AppleScript Editor to save to connect.scpt and run with `osascript connect.scpt` <comment272627> Probably should have mentioned that the first time. Thanks, updated. <comment305932> @user14492 you mean something like this? https://github.com/hlissner/lb6-actions/tree/master/VPN.lbaction/Contents <comment305948> @lucianf Yep that's the one! Can't believe you actually found it. :P
