Should I create a Fusion Drive before or after downgrade (from Yosemite to Mavericks)? <body> I bought a used Mac Mini late 2012 with installed Yosemite and two drives: SSD 128 GB and HDD 500 GB. I want to create a Fusion Drive and downgrade to Mavericks via bootable USB flash drive. What should I do in which order? 1) Boot into recovery HD and create a Fusion  Drive (erasing all data) 2) Install Mavericks on SSD part of Fuzion Drive?  But if I already have a Fusion Drive how do I choose explicitely that I want OS to be installed on SSD not HDD for performance boost?  <answer176950> Your first idea is the only way that it can be done.  ol liBoot into recovery HD and create a Fusion Drive (erasing all data)/li liInstall Mavericks on SSD part of Fusion Drive/li /ol  A Fusion drive is for all intents and purposes a single drive, the OS sees only one Volume. The promise of a Fusion drive is that it will optimize the contents in such a way that you will receive the highest performance possible while having a large volume to store your data in.
