macOS Sierra Recovery Mode does not work <body> I have a Mac mini 2014, running macOS Sierra from a SSD drive, and using an Apple Keyboard M9034 D/A.  Since I replaced the rotational hard drive (HDD) with an SSD, I do not see the Apple logo on the screen to show it's loading.  strongThe start up shortcuts below do not work:/strong  kbd⇧ Shift /kbd Start up in Safe Mode;   kbd⌥ Option (alt)/kbd Start up to Startup Manager;  kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdS/kbd Start up in single-user mode;   kbd⌘ Command /kbdkbdR/kbd - Start up from macOS Recvery    kbd⌥ Option (alt)/kbdkbd⌘ Command /kbdkbdR/kbd Start up from macOS Recovery over the Internet.  strongThe only combination that works is the PRAM reset:/strong  kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd  ul liAlready tried with 3 different keyboards./li liInstalled a complete fresh copy of the Operating System./li limacOS Recovery only works if the system has some kind of issue, meaning if the boot does not work./li /ul  kbdC/kbd Start up from a bootable USB only works if there is not an operating system on the hard drive.  Anyone have suggestions to try?  <answer281559> Thanks Kevin Grabher,  You gave me the solution....  I tried booting the system using only the HDMI monitor, removed the Mini DisplayPort VGA adaprter.  Using only the HDMI cable and monitor, everything works.   <comment353937> You should edit that information into your question, don't just post a comment with it. <comment354060> @book453, thanks for the pointer. <comment354171> What kind of display and cable are you using? What exactly happens if you press and hold option/alt after pressing the power button? <comment354277> @Kevin Grabher, I have two monitors connected to the Mac mini, one using Hdmi and the other APPLE MB572Z/B Mini DisplayPort  VGA adapter, pressing option doesn't do anything, both display don't receive any signal, the same happens with cmd+option R, only black screen... I managed to boot on recovery mode with success rate of 1 in many tries. At the moment I am trying to install El Capitan in another disk, to see if it works, but didn't manage yet to boot from USB installation disc.
