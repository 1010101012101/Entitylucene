OS X wants me to reset my password randomly <body> I restarted from Windows (under Boot Camp) via Restart in OS X..., which I've done many times before. This time, my MacBook restarted and stayed black for a while. I eventually held the power button to reboot it.  It eventually came back up to a Reset Password recovery screen. I tried restarting and holding Option to select the Macintosh partition, but it always comes back to Reset Password.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9it1.png" alt="enter image description here"  I didn't forget my password. What's going on?  <answer201042> I found the answer here: Skip Reset Password for OS X     OS X Yosemite has a troublesome password reset screen you can access by turning your computer off and back on from the login screen. strongHowever, once you do this, there is no way out./strong The "Reset Password" boot wizard offers no exit without reseting your password. If you restart your Mac, you will end up right back in the wizard.   The solution is a PRAM reset: codeCommand-Option-P-R/code during bootup.
