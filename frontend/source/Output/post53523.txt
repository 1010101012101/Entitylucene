What displays are capable of displaying full resolution from the new MacBook Pro with retina display? <body> What displays are capable of displaying 2880 by 1800 pixels from the new MacBook Pro with Retina display?   The current Apple Thunderbolt Display is only capable of 2560 by 1440 pixels.   <answer53527> As of yet there are no screens for the consumer that can do more than 2560 x 1600. However, if you have the money you can buy cinema 4k projectors. The problem with that is I have no idea if you can connect that to anything other than a special graphics card that typically powers them. (Maybe with an external Thunderbolt to PCIE adaptor?)
