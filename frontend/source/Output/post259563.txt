"Could not activate cellular data network" - cellular data not working on iPhone <body> I am getting an iOS system error:     strongCould not activate cellular data network/strong      Turn on cellular data or use Wi-Fi to access data.   while I'm not connected to Wi-Fi and I'm trying to use any apps that need a data connection. Cellular data is turned on, and I'm not in airplane mode or anything. LTE was working just fine yesterday.  I have tried codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings/code with no success.  In case this is relevant, details from codeGeneral &gt; About/code:  ul liiPhone 6 (Verizon; MG642LL/a)/li liCarrier: Verizon 25.1 (I'm subscribed with PagePlus MVNO on Verizon's network)/li liiOS: v10.0.2/li liModem Firmware: 5.24.00/li /ul  Is this likely a problem with my phone, or with PagePlus? How can I resolve it? Thanks!  <answer259602> emETA/em: Go to ivzwentp.tracfone.com and install the configuration profile. This fixed the problem for me. (That's what the text I got last week instructed me to do. I was able to find a copy of that text online, at a different site.)  hr  Same problem here, also on PagePlus. I've tried to chat with PagePlus customer service but have been unable to get through. I did get a weird text message last week about iPhone data issues on PagePlus - maybe that was related? I thought it was spam so I deleted it...  <answer259616> For what it's worth, below is the email I got back from PagePlus technical support. Installing the configuration profile worked for me, but strongCAUTION/strong, iOS says that the linked configuration profile is emunsigned/em which means that we can't be confident that this is the exact file PagePlus intended us to download. Theoretically, a malicious hacker could swap it out with their own file, and do bad things to our phone once we install it. So proceed at your own risk!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/osU6q.jpg" alt="This configuration profile from PagePlus is NOT signed"     Hi [redacted].      Thank you for your e-mail.      This is a response to the Ticket#[redacted].      We do apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced.      Checking the account [redacted], we have verified that your phone is   provisioned correctly in our billing system. You are still good with   the $55 plan until tonight at midnight. You already have a reserved   balance that will automatically renew the account after the current   $55 plan expires. You will need to update your data connection again   by following the steps below.      ? To resolved data connection, please follow this basic   troubleshooting steps that I am providing you.      1) Place your phone on airplane mode for about 10 to 15 seconds.  2)   Disable the airplane mode and restart your phone.  3) Once your phone   is on, wait until it will displays atleast 3 or more signal bars.  4)   Make sure that your WiFi connectivity is off and Mobile data is on.    5) Try to access some of your phone online applications to check if   its working.      ? If not, we need to install a PROFILE in your phone to have your data   service activated.      1) Before we install a Profile, we need to check your device, to make   sure that there is no Profile on it.  2) Please go to SETTINGS, click   GENERAL ( usually when you click GENERAL, you will notice PROFILE but   if there's no profile that's fine. If there is we need to delete   that.)      ? To install a PROFILE you must disable your Mobile data.      1) Then kindly enable your WiFi, and make sure that you are properly   connected.  2) Open your SAFARI browser then, open this link   ivzwentp.tracfone.com (must be in lowercase),  3) Click install   PROFILE then select INSTALL. Please take note: Some iPhone cannot   recognize the link provided. But don't worry it is safe, so please   continue to install.  4) Once it was installed successfully. Please   disable your WiFi connectivity and enable your mobile data.  5) Make   sure that LTE is showing at the top of your phone screen. Try to   access some of your phone online application to check if everything is   working good.      NOTE: Before doing those steps, make sure that you have atleast 50% of   battery and good signal bars.

I installed the profile even though it is unsigned, since the link is provided by customer service people directly.  <answer262556> After weeks of my tracfone not working, I finally found an answer with tracfone customer service. Go to iphone.flexserve.net. Select APN &amp; Proxy Changer, Enter your country, then for operator, select "Straight Talk (tracfone.vzwe...)", then click "Generate Profile" and install the profile. Turn your phone off and then back on. If that doesn't work, try Verizon (4G LTE) as the operator.   <answer265196> I just followed Aaron's suggestion: emGo to iphone.flexserve.net. Select APN &amp; Proxy Changer, Enter your country, then for operator, select "Straight Talk (tracfone.vzwe...)",/em  I wanted to add that I use Tracfone (over Verizon network), not Straight Talk, but this solution worked perfectly for me on an iPhone SE that a month or so ago had started having the problem: “Could not activate cellular data network”  <answer277063> I had the same problem in December and that is what Tracfone told me to do as well. It works. I will say I seem to have this issue every time I add data to my phone.  <answer280315> I have had this same issue on my iPhone SE.  I use tracfone and I bought a 200 minutes card yesterday.  It added the minutes and data and texts into my account but then my phone could not use data.  I had plenty of bars of signal and it showed Verizon LTE (I have the cdma tracfone card).  I had to call tracfone several times before someone there could help me but it is resolved now.  They had to update something and the rep asked me the MEID number and IMEI number from my phone plus my sim number.  It took about 30 minutes once I reached a person who knew how to fix this.  Also this has happened to me a couple times before.  I love having affordable service on an iPhone so I will continue to deal with this inconvenience.  Also I do NOT believe this is an issue with the gsm sims but the CDMA has much better signal strength where I live.    <answer290992> I had same issues but then found this out took me a week but now my data works go to https://iphone.flexserve.net and  select  Verizon  4g not tacfone profile and you should be able to use your data.   <comment324756> There's a few similar questions about this.  See if [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/52624/88313) helps.  It's not a direct duplicate but it's similar. <comment324759> Thanks. Unfortunately the menu path described there (`Settings  Carrier`) doesn't even seem to exist anymore. If you read his update, he says even that appears not to have fixed his problem. Does lead me to believe this is a carrier issue, though. <comment324817> Yeah, I just got a message from them with the same link. It feels really shady though--they want you to install a cellular configuration "Profile" (I had never heard of this--I'm not well versed in cellular networking stuffs)--but iOS says the profile PP linked to is *unsigned*, which feels really questionable. Not sure how much of a security risk it is to install something like this. And yet, it did get LTE working... <comment324823> I get new profiles from AT&T after almost every major iOS release so the 'process' of installing a new profile is ok.  I can't speak to the validity of the link you received, only you can do that. <comment324827> Do the AT&T profiles you install say "Not Signed" in red text? This one does. That's the part I'm more worried about. If it's not signed, I am much less confident that it isn't malicious, and apparently from reading up, configuration profiles can give third parties a lot of control over your phone. <comment326583> I wouldn't install any profile that's not signed. <comment326587> @fsb reasonable, but it's a dilemma: install profile or lose cellular data on PagePlus <comment346818> Yeah, it's not signed and it's over a non-secure http channel. This caused me not to use it for a while until I was desperate and just did it. I figured I could wipe my phone if there was an issue. But it fixed the cellular non-data issue. I have the same URL as was posted here. <comment348759> Welcome to Ask Different. Please don't add comments in the _Answer_ field as this is for answers to questions.
