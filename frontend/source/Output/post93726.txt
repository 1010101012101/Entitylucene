How to tell if Macbook is using 802.11ac <body> I just got a new Macbook Air and a new Airport Extreme, both of which support 802.11ac.  Is there an easy way to tell if my Macbook Air is connecting to the Airport Extreme via 802.11ac?  Relatedly, can I tell if I'm connecting at 5GHz band or 2.4GHz band?  I've already done a speedtest, and the results are inconclusive.  <answer93728> Hold Option key (alt) and press on your WiFi icon.  That will instantly tell you if you connected with 2.4 or 5 Gig in the expanded menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KYo52.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer93729> When you're connected to the Wi-Fi network, hold down kbdoption/kbd and click the Wi-Fi icon in the OS X menubar. You'll see additional details about your connection, including one item labelled codePHY Mode:/code. That will show you whether you're connected via 802.11ac, n, g, etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n5ikT.png" alt="Wi-Fi menu with extended options"  There's also a codeChannel:/code entry that tells you the radio frequency and channel.  <comment303241> Wow, I really liked this! <comment344322> Is there a way to check this from the terminal?
