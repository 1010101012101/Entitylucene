CommCenter (from CoreTelephony.framework) is eating 600+ MB of my RAM, why do I even need it? <body> I'm talking about a MacBook laptop, running OS X 10.11.3.br As far as I understand, CoreTelephony.framework is about cellular networks, so it might be useful on phones, for example. But the laptop obviously doesn't have any relevant hardware.  I see CommCenter (parent process: launchd (1)) in Activity Monitor and it's said to consume 600+ MB of RAM. That's too much for something useless.  How can I get rid of it? And why does it show up there? (Can it be a sign of some malware and stuff?)  Update:br After killing that process manually, I don't see anything bad happening.  <comment282500> Just a thought but this is also used for VOIP connections, have you installed Skype or other similar VOIP service? <comment282788> @SteveChambers Not Skype™, but I have installed Hangouts™ plugin for Firefox. But I am not sure if it's really used for VoIP connections, where did you got that information? <comment282813> I googled CoreTelephony.framework.
