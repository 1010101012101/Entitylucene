How to easily rename voice memos in iTunes <body> Recorded by native Voice Memo app on iPhone 5, and then sync to iTunes. But found those displayed name of voice memos that are set when I was recording are different with real file names in  iTunes after sync.  I have dozens of voice memo. How to easily rename real names with these displayed name that I want to have?  <answer148031> I had this problem too, but I found when I used iTunes to create an mp3 version of the file, the mp3 had the title I had set previously.  <comment174503> This doesn't appear to answer the question asked.
