iPhone 6 / Sprint / DTMF codes <body> Traded in my iPhone 5 for a 6.   New problem: cannot join conference calls.  When I enter my code for the call, it spits out random numbers.  For example, I press 1,2,3,4,5,6 and it reads back to me 7398004 or something similar.   After 10 days, Apple gave me a new iPhone 6 just in case it was an issue on their end.  None of their tech guys could figure it out.  New phone does the same exact thing.  My daughters 6 does the same thing.    I have done ##clear# and ##update# and have gotten it to work, albeit temporarily.  After 30 minutes or so, or after 1 successful test, the issue returns.    I have a quasi friend who is a technician for sprint in one of their stores and he is flabbergasted.  Has no answers.    Any help would be appreciated.   Ios 8.0.2 on all phones, and the issue was present on iOS 8 as well  <comment175560> whos app is it for the conf call <comment175565> I use free conference call.com as well as a corporate bridgeline. <comment175569> OK, try to change your keyboard to another language.
