How do I remove an incorrect phone number from my iphone 4S? <body> I keep texting an unknown person. I have the wrong number in my phone - though it does not appear in the contact  <comment136026> Could you elaborate on what's exactly the problem? As far as I understand, you text someone from you *Contacts List* but instead of doing so to the number you've got, it sends it to a different one. Is this correct? <comment136032> Also, Apple's iMessage can confuse things if you want to sort out SMS. You could go into the settings app and let us know if iMessage is on or off and explain a little more about how you are detecting that the wrong behavior is happening.
