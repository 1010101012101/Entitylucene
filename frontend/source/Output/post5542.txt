what is the best way to get my gmail contacts on my ipod touch contacts list <body> i have a new ipod touch and i want to get my gmail contacts available on the ipod touch contacts.  what is the best way to do this?  <answer5543> I am using Google Sync for this, it sets my Google Account up as an Exchange server so emails, calendars (multiple) and contacts are synced over the air.  There is a walk through on how to set this up on the Google help pages for the sync feature.  <answer5559> iTunes offers this option in the sync panel out of the box, at least with an iPhone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r41VA.png" alt="Google contacts iPhone"
