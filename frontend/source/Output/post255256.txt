What app or program do I use to open a chat.db-wal file <body> What program or app do I use to open a chat.db-wal file?  <answer255270> emchat.db-wal/em (besides chat.db and chat.db-shm) is a part of the sqlite3 database managing all your messages sent and received by the app Messages.  So the main app using this database as a "client" is Messages.  The purpose of the file chat.db-wal is to provide atomicity and durability in database systems by write-ahead logging (WAL).  You can open the file explicitly by using any text editor (which I don't recommend) and implicitly by using a SQLite3 GUI like DB Browser for SQLite 3.9.0 or sqlitestudio 3.1.0.  hr  Better create a copy of all database files and use these to tinker with them.  <comment317871> Which application is creating this file?
