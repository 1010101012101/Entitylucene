Time Machine started to backup files, it is still working and data is larger than actual disk data <body> I cleaned backup disk as it was full and started a clean (empty) Time Machine backup. On a disk of 465Gb my data occupies 321Gb. Time Machine has started backuping files and I found interesting that estimated backup size was increasing during the day. Left it to work overnight, and in the morning at time of writing it has backuped 485Gb out of estimated 533Gb. The difference between backuped files and estimated full size is increasing as I see.  How is this possible? What went wrong? Should I exclude some folder?  The Mac is OS X Yosemite. Time Machine worked correctly before upgrade.  <answer157172> This procedure helped to resolve the issue:  ol liTurn off Time Machine and wait to completely stop/li liErase Time Machine folder with all data (in my case a folder on NAS server but can be an USB disk)./li liErase Time Machine configuration file on Mac: code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code/li liSetup Time Machine options. E.g. set exclude folders/li liTurn On Time Machine/li /ol  I'm not sure about the conclusion, but suspect that .plist file was somehow corrupted.  <comment184655> Are you downloading anything large?  If so, it could be doing an hourly backup of each version of the file that hasn't yet finished downloading. <comment184679> No downloads. Over the night all programs (including browsers) were turned off.
