Damage on Apple Aluminium Keyboard <body> Yesterday I was cleaning my keyboard (with tissue paper and cleaning gel), and I did a keyboard test afterwards, and I found out my "S" and "F10" keys are broken. I've tried putting it upside down and leaving it overnight, the first few times I plugged it in, the "S" key was pressed and the accent selection list pops up, but those keys still do not work. I've also tried blowdrying it, taking off the keycaps to inspect for damage, and the keys are still broken. Does my keyboard have any chance of getting fixed without going to an Apple Store? Any ideas on how to fix this would be helpful, thanks.  UPDATE: The "S" key work now, after leaving it on my shelf for a few weeks. It doesn't work all the time, but most of the times. However the F10 key is still dead, unfortunate, but a lost I can deal with. So if anyone happens to encounter the same issue, don't throw away the keyboard, leave it unplugged for a few weeks and it might work again.  <comment278620> Got a very similar problem last year.  It showed the key presses I did on the keyboard on the on-screen keyboard so I suspected something was wrong with the keyboard software mappings.  After spending too much time with re-cleaning the keyboard, taking out keys etc I bought a new one and everything worked since.  I'm afraid it's fried. <comment278631> Ah, crap, that's what I'm afraid of. Guess I'll have to save up for another keyboard (maaaaybe not Apple, considering my first Apple Keyboard had it's 2WSX row randomly fail) then, meanwhile I'll just use a spare keyboard that I have.
