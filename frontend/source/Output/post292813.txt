How to mount company network share? <body> I got a MacBook Air as my working computer running strongMacOS Sierra 10.12.5/strong. Within the intranet at the company office we got a network share. Whenever I want to use it, I have to add it via the Finder using the strongCMD + K/strong command.      smb://server/share   This is then mounted as:     /Volumes/share/   There are two problems or questions about it.  strongReconnect:/strong When I'm out of the network and back again, MacOS can't access the share again and I have to reconnect using the CMD + K command. Is there a way to add it as auto-connect so that MacOS tries to re-establish the link if possible?  strongName of volume:/strong Because of the manual reconnect, MacOS starts to increase the number of the volume again and again. This is only reset if I restart MacOS but not through hibernate/sleep mode. Is there a way to change this?     /Volumes/share-1/      /Volumes/share-2/   <answer292828> One solution should fix both issues. You can work around the -1 and -2 issue by unmounting the volumes before disconnecting from the network (sleeping the Mac) or cleaning up in /Volumes before reconnecting.
