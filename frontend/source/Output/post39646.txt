Downloading certain file extensions opens app? <body> Lately, if I download code.torrent/code files from Safari, it automatically opens an app called codeSQLite/code. codeSQLite/code is just used for looking at my sql databases, and obviously not torrents.  The torrents are also set to open in Transmission, not SQLlite. I know Safari auto opens files with trusted extensions, but that's not the case here.  Also, if I move the torrent from the downloads folder to my desktop, it opens the app too. I deleted SQLlite, but the problem is still happening, although in this case it stops focusing on the current window and focuses on nothing. What I mean by this is that when you open a normal app, the window that is behind is unfocused and the new app window is focused. When I move or dl these code.torrent/code files, it tries to open SQLite, but since I deleted it, it stops focusing on the current window, and to an invisible window, since the app is not there.  Any ideas what's going on here?  <comment44790> Did you see if the application (SQLite Database Browser?) still has some launchd agent in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`? Are there any background processes related to it? <comment44887> It does not have a launch agent, and there are no background processes attached to it. <comment44902> Did you try resetting the Launch Services database with `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -all local,system,user`?
