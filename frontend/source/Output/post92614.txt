Finder move does not merge but replaces old folder, how to get old folder's contents <body> I moved folder named FOLDERA to another folder where same name folder exists. Finder asked me to replace? I complied thinking that it will merge two folders like windows. It completely replaced my older folder.   ul liUndo (-Z) does not bring back/li liTrash does not show my old files/li /ul  Is there any way to bring back these files?  <comment108641> I would say you are out of luck :(  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20120218074834885 <comment108680> You could try using [DiskWarrior](http://www.alsoft.com/diskwarrior/) or [Data Rescue](http://www.prosofteng.com/products/data_rescue.php).
