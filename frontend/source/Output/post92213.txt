Applescript to get Dropbox file direct/share link <body> Is it possible to retrieve the direct/share link of a file that is in my Dropbox folder, but not in its Public subfolder?  I'd like to use that for an Alfred workflow. I saw many tutorials on how to do that for files that are in the Public folder but I'd like to use the new way Dropbox handles files sharing.  Thanks!  <answer92313> To generate a shared link from a private folder you must make a request to Dropbox's servers using authentication with the Dropbox API. See the docs here. I am not sure you can do that from an applescript, maybe you can use codecurl/code. But if you want this in an Alfred workflow you can always use another scripting language like php or python, which are more suitable.    <comment108346> Thanks for the info. That's what I thought. As I am not a developer, I can't code a php/python/ruby thing for the Dropbox API. I'll need to look for further help.
