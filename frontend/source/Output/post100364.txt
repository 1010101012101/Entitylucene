Print Excel sheet with hyperlinks to PDF format while retaining links <body> Hej,  I'm trying to print Excel 2011 sheet with hyperlinks into pdf format, but the output file doesn't retain hyperlinks.  Is there a way to preserve them in output format?  <answer100366> Rather than printing it to PDF try saving it to PDF.   <answer127163> Excel 2011 will keep the link when you save as PDF, but only if you give the full URL. I could not find a native way to retain embedded hyperlinks when saving to a PDF from Excel 2011.  However, there are a number of workarounds:  ul liIf you have Numbers (the Apple equivalent of Excel) you can upload your xls file and then save as a PDF from there./li liIf you strongdon't/strong have Numbers, you can use an online conversion tool such as: http://www.zamzar.com/ /li /ul  <comment118233> I've tried to save it to PDF, but still no luck. Altough, if saved from Excel 2013 for Windows to pdf, hyperlinks are working. <comment118235> There is no Office 2010 on OSX. Did you mean 2011 ? <comment118236> @MatthieuRiegler, yes, right, 2011.
