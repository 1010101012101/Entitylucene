iMac install Java, webpage test succeeds, `javac` fails <body> I'm trying to install Java on my iMac running 10.9.5. I downloaded and installed JDK according to the official Oracle instructions. When testing via the web-page at the end of the install, Java is detected. However, when running codejavac/code or codejava/code in the terminal, I get an error reporting I must install a JDK. I understand that there are different Javas for web apps and desktop apps, but why can only Safari detect my Java? Is there another way to install Java that I'm missing?  <answer164520> You installed a JRE instead of the JDK. The JDK can be found here.
