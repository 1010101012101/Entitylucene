save or forward texts from an iPod touch <body> Is it possible to save or forward texts from an iPod touch?  This is for a kid who is being bullied by a class-mate, and I want to keep a record of the texts sent.  <answer66404> There is no way to have the native Messages app (assuming you have a compatible iPod Touch, and are using that app), automatically forward texts. You can, however, manually forward texts: open the Messages app, open a thread, tap Edit, tap the check boxes for the texts to forward, tap Forward, then enter the recipient.   Unless the user deletes the messages, they aren't deleted automatically. As a result, they are saved in a way. However, it is very easy for the user to delete the messages, and once deleted, there is no way to recover them.  <answer66405> A rather easy way is to just take screenshots of the offending messages and syncing/mailing them to your computer for future reference.  <answer104609> PhoneView http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/ is a Mac app to let you save out your text messages as PDF files.    <answer105397> Sometimes I take screenshots to save my text messages. I also use the desktop program decipher text message when I need to save an entire conversation history to my computer for archiving. The software is easy to use and effective. If you just need to save one text though, a screenshot might be simpler for your needs!  <comment78119> There is no SMS on an iPod touch. Which app are you using here? <comment78137> definitely a good option if there's no alternative, but I prefer to have the entire stream, rather than just one message. <comment123078> PhoneView http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/ is a Mac app to let you save out your text messages as PDF files.
