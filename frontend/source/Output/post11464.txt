Netcat -e on Mac OS X <body> I'm a newbie macuser coming from Debian, and I'm a big command line user. One one my preferred one is netcat (aka nc on mac). I especially loved the -e option which enabled to create a process that deals bidirectionnally with the strems.  Unfortunately, when I use the classic:  precodenc -l -p 6666 -e /bin/bash /code/pre  Netcat does not agree with me, and I get this:  precodenc: illegal option -- e usage: nc [-46DdhklnrtUuvz] [-i interval] [-p source_port]       [-s source_ip_address] [-w timeout] [-X proxy_version]       [-x proxy_address[:port]] [hostname] [port[s]] /code/pre  What does that mean? Can I use this command in another way?  Thanks for your help,  Rob  PS: if someone can edit the tags, would be better -- netcat, nc are not known here :)  <answer11466> I've just checked the man page.  Doesn't look like that flag is supported.  I suppose you could download a different version.. (perhaps 'netcat' instead of 'nc').  <answer11473> After doing some research, it appears that the codenetcat/code distributed in MacOS is a rather old (imported at 2005-10-07) version of netcat-openbsd clone. Here is the header file from the netcat.c hosted at opensource.apple.com.  code/* $OpenBSD: netcat.c,v 1.82 2005/07/24 09:33:56 marius Exp $ *//code  There are three popular versions of codenetcat/code in the wild:  ul lignu-netcat or netcat ver. 0.71/li linetcat 1.10 or nc110 (also known as netcat-traditional in debian) /li liand the openbsd version (netcat-openbsd, the netcat metapackage points to it) which is in active development./li /ul  Currently only the gnu and 1.10 versions support code-e/code option and it's considered insecure. In the 1.10 version you should compile with code-DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE/code define to enable the code-e/code switch.  The easiest way to install this version would be to use homebrew or other ports system (homebrew uses netcat 0.71 source).   <answer14407> If you install Nmap (debianports) you will also get ncat. ncat is basically an advanced version of nc with the options like: -e, --ssl, --broker, --chat, ...  <comment11984> Yep... I'm wondering if macports/darwin or something like that could be helpful in this case... When I'll get a little bit more time, i'll have a look at the source version. Thx for the retagging btw :) <comment11985> @Rob or [`brew install netcat`](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) (‚Üê there's a link hidden in the code) :-) <comment11992> @koiyu Looks good... I didn't know all this Mac things. This one sounds reassuring :) <comment11994> That's perfect... If you create an answer, I'm gonna accept it! Thanks Harv as well. <comment11997> @Rob: @mspasov's recent answer is more thorough than mine could be, so it deserves to be accepted. <comment15561> interesting... Thanks for the tip!
