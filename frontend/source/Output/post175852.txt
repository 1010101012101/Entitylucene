Copy contents of a file <body> I am trying to copy a whole bunch different files' contents into one big file. Is there a way to do this without having to open up each individual file and copying and pasting the contents? Is there a quick way to just right click a file and copy the contents directly? Thanks in advance!  <answer175854> If you are talking about plain text files, you can accomplish this in Terminal by running  precodecat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt &gt; bigfile.txt /code/pre  <answer175857> You can run the shell command strong/usr/bin/textutil/strong  in the strongTerminal.app/strong found in /Applications/Utilities/   strongtextutils/strong  Can be used to convert the text from one format to another.  But it also can  "Read the specified files, concatenate them, and write the result out as a single file in the indicated format."  strong/usr/bin/textutil/strong emfile/s/em strong-cat/strong emconvert to format/em strong-output/strong emfile output path/em  It will concatenate differently formatted files.  The formats textutils can read and write to are  strongtxt, html, rtf, rtfd, doc, docx, wordml, odt, or webarchive/strong  Example  code/usr/bin/textutil foo1.txt foo2.txt foo1.rtf foo.html -cat txt -output /file/path/foo.txt/code  <comment207523> Are you talking about plain text files or some other format? <comment207525> Some are plain text, but just for completeness, I would like JUST the text, regardless of the format. So converting to plain text and then copying <comment207526> There is no generic way for non-plain text files, you need to be specific about the application/format (Word doc, Pages etc.) <comment207527> Ok. Then just plain text is ok. <comment207533> Nice way to use to use textutil for doing this. <comment207535> You should be able to print them to one PDF using 'lpr', this way its also possible to keep the images and layout/style as well.
