What's the best way to place 4 pictures on a A4 sheet using the mac? <body> What's the best way to place 4 pictures on a A4 sheet using the mac ? (or iPad / iPhone) ? I need to create a pdf.  iPhoto seems not to have such functionality. I would like to know if there is an easy way, before to use Photoshoot and manually resize them...  Thanks  <answer46081> You can do this using Preview. Here's how I do it (on Lion, but I'm pretty sure it was much the same on Snow Leopard).  ol liSelect the 4 images in Finder/li liOpen with Preview/li liSelect the 4 images in the Preview sidebar/li liFrom the menubar, select File  Print.../li liChange the dropdown half-way down the page to "Layout"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dz9tX.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="6" liChange "Pages per sheet" to 4 (you should now see the 4 images together on the single sheet on the left)/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f46N8.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="7" liSelect "Save as PDF..." from the PDF dropdown in the bottom left/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KUwNZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also customise the paper type, layout direction and approximate scale of each picture to whatever suits best.  <comment52577> Anyone able to fix the list numbering? It looks correct in the edit window, but wrong in the preview and subsequently when I submit. <comment52579> Do you have Pages? <comment52581> Simply great. Thanks
