How to show Hard Disk icon on Desktop via Terminal? <body> Is there a command in Terminal that allows you to show the Hard Disk as an icon on your Desktop?  I know the manual process of doing it, which is, Finder  Preferences...  General and check "Hard disks" under "Show these items on the desktop:", but I want to be able to apply this configuration through the command line.  Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!  <answer230284> To show various drive icons on the desktop use the following commands in Terminal:  External hard drives:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder ShowExternalHardDrivesOnDesktop -bool true /code/pre  Hard drives:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder ShowHardDrivesOnDesktop -bool true /code/pre  Removable media:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder ShowRemovableMediaOnDesktop -bool true /code/pre  (To complete all options available in the Finder preferences: mounted servers:)  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder ShowMountedServersOnDesktop -bool true /code/pre  Afterwards restart the Finder:  precodekillall -HUP Finder /code/pre  To disable showing the respective desktop icons simply replace emtrue/em by emfalse/em
