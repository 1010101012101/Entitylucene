You'll have to either roll back to Lion or find a third-party app that allows this.  <answer199074> You can use the following third party software:  iExplorer - http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/31722/iexplorerbr iMazing - http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/27830/imazingbr PhoneView - http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25347/phoneview  I believe you will have to copy/paste the information manually.  <answer260020> I believe you can do it with iTunes. If not try iTools or iFunbox, both softwares have powerful tools.   <comment92317> My apologies for not specifying about this earlier. I had browsed through this article.
