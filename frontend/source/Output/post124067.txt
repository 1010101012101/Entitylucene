Why can't I choose full screen mode in Photoshop CS6? <body> I am using a trial version of Photoshop CS6, and I can't choose full screen mode. I am running OS X 10.9.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TvWwO.png" alt="enter image description here"   What's wrong?  <answer124074> Make sure there is a file opened first, if photoshop is "empty" the options are indeed grayed out even in the registered version of photoshop cs6.  Let me know if this fixed it  <comment144991> Could it be because of Trial version? did you check that ? <comment144993> On which OSX did you tried this ? <comment144996> @Buscarì›ƒ Maybe, I don't know. <comment144997> @MatthieuRiegler OSX 10.9.1 <comment145004> I will check this tip when I am using PS tomorrow. <comment145005> You have to open a file first with PS. Then only the Fullscreen mode is available. <comment145111> Yes, that's correct! Thank you.
