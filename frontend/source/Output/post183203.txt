MacBook Pro trackpad click <body> I am new to the MacBook Pro laptop. Why does the trackpad have to be pressed down to register a click, rather than just touching on the pad? Is there a way to change this? Please advise because it is very irritating to have to press hard on the trackpad.  <answer183205> You can enable "Tap-To-Click" in the strongSystem Preferences/strong.  Go to codeSystem Preferences/code from the ï£¿ menu, and click on codeTrackpad/code. (near the middle of the screen)  There should be a screen that looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qZNdd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
