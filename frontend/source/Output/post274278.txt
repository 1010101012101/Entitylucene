Displayport not showing display <body> I've got a MacBook Pro (Mid 2014) with OS 10.12.3 and I'm trying to connect it to an external display. In one of my displayports (got 2) it works and the other doesn't show the display (meaning I know that the cable is ok as it works with one of my 2 displayports). I also know that the displayport that strongdoes not/strong show the display is working correctly as I validated it by connecting an ethernet adapter (and got connectivity).  Also, if it is of any help, I am running CUDA 8.0.63 and my GPU driver version is "10.14.20 355.10.05.15f03".  I have tried resetting NVRAM and SMC and those didn't help, and will appreciate any ideas on this.  strongNote 1:/strong I have several displays, all of which are not working with that displayport (and using different working adapters didn't work). The displays are all DELL U2412M.  strongNote 2:/strong I am using VGA or DVI cables, didn't try displayport as I have no adapter for that (but it's on the list).  Thanks!  <comment344822> Have you tried running just one display off the port in question? <comment344830> What do you mean? Sadly, I can't run any display through that displayport but can run through the other one (I want all 3 external displays) <comment344836> What I mean is, have you tried disconnecting *all* displays and just hooking up a *single* display to the port you say isn't working?  You need to verify whether the port is working or not and hooking up an *Ethernet* adapter doesn't qualify because it's a Thunderbolt to Ethernet, not DisplayPort to Ethernet.  Secondly, how many *external* displays are you trying to connect?  External as in additional to your built in display. <comment344948> Thanks for clarifying that! I am trying to connect 3 external displays and use only those (meaning, not my built in display). I tried connecting just a single display into that port without, but that didn't work as well (though the screen flickered for a second and then remained black).
