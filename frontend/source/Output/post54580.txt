OSX program similar to 'Fences' <body> Is there a Mac program resembling the Windows program 'Fences' (see screenshot below), which allows you to group icons on your screen?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/60hyl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer54641> I'm not sure its exactly what you need, but how about something like DesktopShelves (there's also a free version)?  <answer73315> Desktop Groups (Which I would describe as the best alternative to fences) is made by the same people who make Desktop Shelves. The product is paid, but the Lite version of Desktop Groups is free.  A good review of its features can found here courtesy of Fatima Wahib who reviewed it for Addictive Tips last month:  <comment62519> Similar question answered on superuser.com:  http://superuser.com/questions/17582/is-there-a-fences-alternative-for-mac-os-x <comment62575> @Lars: Thanks for the link - one of the items mentioned, [Drag Thing](http://www.dragthing.com/), looks very similar to Fences.
