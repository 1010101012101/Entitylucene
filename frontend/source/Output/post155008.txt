rEFIt boot changed after update to Yosemite <body> I was using rEFIt to work with Ubuntu with my Mac. After the upgrade to Yosemite I had a problem with rEFIt. I found the following solution on ubuntuforums.org but rEFIt still didn't work:  precodecd /efi/refit ./enable.sh /code/pre  So I tried to install rEFInd. It "works", or better, at the boot of the Mac I can see the Linux and Apple partition, but if I choose the linux one it doesn't work. The message "No Bootable Device" appears on screen.  I think that the problem is that the Yosemite update has changed the rEFIt table. Indeed, now I have 2 recovery partitions when, before the update, I only had one.  This is what codediskutil list/code shows:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh SSD           231.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                  Apple_HFS Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s4    5: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF               23.2 GB    disk0s5 /code/pre  Obviously the corrupted partition is the last one.  I have important information in my Ubuntu partition which I do not wish to lose.  What can I do?  <comment182354> Are you able to access that Linux partition at all anymore? You say it's "corrupted" but I don't even see it in the list at all. <comment182498> @user15877 i can't access to that partition. I could use a live-usb ubuntu and then i mounted the partition. So if i want i can copy my files in an external device. The problem still that i need to recovery the partition because the file that i have inside are important but more important is all the environment that my friend installed, and that i'm absolutely not able to do. <comment182499> @grgarside i have changed the terminal output image in text.
