A way to test System Integrity Protection SIP (NOT about how to enable/disable)? <body> When I first began using 10.11 El Capitan I had to disable SIP in order to run some stuff, and to avoid some crashes. The crashes were probably likely down to some kext I had leftover from older software installations, etc. Not sure.  Is there a strongway short of enabling SIP/strong to test to see if I have impermissible kexts or anything else in the protected areas that will gag the machine? I don't really wanna go through tons of booting iterations in the hopes of finding things that hang or crash the machine.   To rephrase, this is not about how to enable or disable SIP, but how to programatically or automate a test to determine status of SIP.  <answer264369> I know you can check whether it is on or off in terminal with this command:  csrutil status  I think you might be looking for more detailed analysis though.  <comment293017> see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11?rq=1 <comment293048> I think we should close as duplicate <comment293051> I don't think there's a way to 'test' SIP without enabling/disabling and rebooting a few times. <comment293055> Would there be a way to check file permissions to see what would NOT be allowed in the SIP protected folders? <comment293064> I can think of several ways - hang tight while I test them - this should stay open IMO.
