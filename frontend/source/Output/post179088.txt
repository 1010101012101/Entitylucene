I have two Macs on the same Apple ID. Sharing issue <body> When I access the internet on Mac 1, the other Mac (Mac 2) has a extra icon pop up and can see what I access. Both Macs use the same Apple ID and are on the same domain. Two different users are signed on.   For instance, I will go to espn on Mac 1. The person on Mac 2 will have an extra Safari icon pop up. That person could click the icon and see what I am seeing.  How do I stop this?  <answer179089> This is called hand off  It allows you to continue where you left off in an app on one Device when you are accessing another device.  It works via the AppleID not the local user.     When your Mac computers and iOS devices are within Bluetooth range of   each other (about 33 feet or 10 meters), they can automatically “hand   off” what you’re doing from one device to another. For example, you   can start writing an email in Mail on your iPhone, then instantly pick   up where you left off in Mail on your Mac.      Handoff app icon in Dock Handoff works with several apps that come   with OS X Yosemite and iOS 8: Calendar, Contacts, Mail, Maps,   Messages, Notes, Phone (iOS only), Reminders, and Safari. It also   works with Keynote v6.5, Numbers v3.5, and Pages v5.5 for Mac, and   Keynote, Numbers, and Pages v2.5 for iOS. Third-party apps may also   work with Handoff.   hr  You can turn it off under the General Preference Pane in System Preferences   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j8ufo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment212225> Both are running Yosemite <comment212227> You can share the same Apple ID for iTunes purchases, but then have different AppleIDs for everything else. This way you can register the other Mac with a different Apple ID in System Settings, while using the same AppleID just with iTunes. <comment212229> This worked! Thanks a lot.  I have been searching for this answer for awhile and this is the first time I posted on a site like this. It is very frustrating to know that it was this simple. I am fairly new with Apple OIS. <comment212246> Could someone with enough rep please edit the title of this post?  A [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) and a [Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh) are very different things.
