Reclaim disk space from old Windows partition? <body> How do I reclaim the disk space used by my former Windows partition?   Clear free space in Disk Utility     So I recently removed Windows 7 from my iMac, but Bootcamp didn't let me do it. I used Disk Utility instead. The old Windows 7 partition now shows up as free space. I want to reinstall Windows 7 again on my iMac, how do I set it up? Can I use the free space again? I want to give the Windows partition a bigger size than what the free space currently holds.   I'm having the exact same issue, but mine is 70 GB of data on 250 GB flash drive. I too am running OS X 10.10, Yosemite.  The accepted answer to the question above says restore the computer, but I don't want to lose my data or buy a Time Machine drive. What should I do?  <answer188256> ul liI installed the Windows 10 Preview./li liI then booted up into OS X./li liI turned off FileVault, and removed my Windows partition via Boot Camp Assistant. /li /ul  Finally, check disk utility and you'll see the free space went to your Mac partition.  <answer188321> The only correct way is indeed to use Bootcamp Assistant to free up the Windows partition space...
