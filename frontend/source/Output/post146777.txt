Error "The Apple ID has not yet been used in iTunes Store" <body> I have an iPhone 4. I have created the Apple ID. Now when I try to download anything from the App Store and I log in with my ID and password, I see the message "this ID has not been yet used". What should I do? I have no more knowledge about these procedures.  <answer147203> Download the latest version of iTunes for your Mac or PC. Install it and log in with your Apple ID. If it presents the terms and conditions for Apple ID, accept them and follow the instructions on the screen.  If you are asked for credit card information, and you don't want to provide it (maybe you will only be getting free apps), you will have to register for a new Apple ID, this time creating it directly in iTunes. That is, the iTunes program on your computer, not on the phone.  strongNote!/strong Do not use a web browser to navigate to https://appleid.apple.com and create your Apple ID. You must create it inside iTunes, and you must click on one of the free items (like a free song). Sadly, that's the only workaround in case you don't want to provide credit card information.  These two web resources might be helpful.  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS5366/li lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT2534/li /ul  Excerpt:     If you haven't created your Apple ID, follow these steps to create an   Apple ID and store account at the same time, without adding a payment   method.   <comment172926> Does the message say anything else besides the part you quoted? Can you add a screenshot? <comment172932> no , not anything else displayed <comment173557> Are you seeing this on iPhone or on a computer with iTunes? <comment187605> What happens if you use the web browser to create your Apple ID?
