What happens to photos that you edit using iPhoto for iOS? <body> If I use iPhoto for iOS to edit a photo from my photostream or one of the albums which is synched from my desktop iPhoto library, it shows up in a special "edited" album in iPhoto for iOS.  Is there a way to have the edited version sent back to my computer? Or accessed from the iOS Photos app?   <answer44223> If you tap the "Share" icon, you have the option to send photos to the Camera Roll or to share them with iTunes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vo0Z5.png" height="300"  This interface is quite flexible, you can send the currently selected photos, all the photos, or choose the photos you want to share. Sharing with iTunes creates a folder in the "Apps" section of your device in iTunes that you can save from:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WMteZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment51675> Might this answer also address this question? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45322/is-there-an-app-that-allows-users-to-take-multiple-photos-and-upload-them-all-to
