How do I read .CHM files in OSX? <body> What software do I need to open and read a .chm document in OS X?  <answer6408> A little bit googled and find this.  http://chmox.sourceforge.net/  Hope it helps...  <answer6409> There are multiple viewers available. This article lists five. I've never used any of these myself, but many are free or shareware. Give them a try.  <answer6410> One of the best apps I've found is iChm. sIt has a Spotlight importer as well as the app itself./s*  It's free as well as being open source.  Only issue I've had with it is that sometimes long "m dashes", like â€”, will not be present, and instead the two words will be run together. (Though, I've looked at the source code myself, and it appears to actually be a problem with codelibchm/code, the open source library that iChm relies on).  *NOTE: the version of iChm in the link above (1.4.2) does emnot/em have a Spotlight importer, but I've forked this project on GitHub and added a Spotlight importer in version 1.5. You can download 1.5 at http://www.markdouma.com/developer/iChm.zip.   The GitHub project is at https://github.com/NSGod/ichm (it may be a day or so before I've pushed all of the changes).  <answer247904> While installing iChm on El Capitan, it was showing me a security warning. So, instead of changing my security settings, I gave CHM Reader from App Store a try. Works well for me.  <comment6690> Development of chmox appears to have ceased since 2005. I would recommend using iChm.
