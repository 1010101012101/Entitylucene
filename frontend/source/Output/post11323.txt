How can I open a Terminal window directly from my current Finder location? <body> I was wondering if there was any was I could right click inside any instance of a "Finder" window such that I have an option that says "Open Terminal Here". It would be really helpful.   <answer11324> cdto seems like it is just what you need. It is a mini-application, designed to be put in the Finder's toolbar, when you run it it will open a terminal window and codecd/code to the current directory in Finder.  <answer11325> Another one: http://homepage.mac.com/thomasw/OpenTerminal/  <answer11354> You can do this with the service feature.  The following site contains an example of such a service: http://blog.leenarts.net/2009/09/03/open-service-here/  <answer19404> h1ShellHere/h1  http://etresoft.org/shellhere.html — Etresoft and John Daniel      … right click inside any instance of a "Finder" window …   I don't know whether it can be reached through a contextual menu, but I keep ShellHere in the toolbar of Finder.   <answer19406> A different approach: DTerm, which gives you a floating command prompt at the top of the window. This works in many apps, not just Finder.  img src="https://cl.ly/3k2T2H1R2J1p3z1T0m2o/content" alt=""  <answer19408> The solution to your troubles is called strongGo2Shell/strong and it does exactly what you're describing. You can find it on the App Store and best of all... it's totally free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zTkfQ.jpg" alt="Go2Shell"  <answer19413> h1OnMyCommand/h1  http://free.abracode.com/cmworkshop/on_my_command.html — version 2.3 (2011-01-16)   Screenshot etc. at http://www.wuala.com/grahamperrin/public/2011/07/31/d/?mode=gallery  Installed and used by me on Snow Leopard before upgrading to Lion. Too soon for me to say whether version 2.3 is compatible with Lion.   <answer20633> As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal provides Services for opening a new terminal window or tab at the selected folder in Finder. They also work with absolute pathnames selected in text (in any application). You can enable these services with strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services/strong. Look for "New Terminal at Folder" and "New Terminal Tab at Folder". You can also assign them shortcut keys.  In addition, you can now drag folders (and pathnames) onto the Terminal application icon to open a new terminal window, or onto a tab bar in a terminal window to create a new tab in that window. If you drag onto a tab (rather than into the terminal view) it will execute a complete codecd/code command to switch to that directory without any additional typing.  As of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8, Command-Dragging into a terminal will also execute a complete codecd/code command.  <answer20681> You can drag any file or folder from the finder onto a Terminal window to insert a string of said file or folder's absolute path.  This will work on any standard install (at least back until 10.4 Tiger [em¿maybe earlier?/em]) without needing additional software our twiddling of preferences, either of which may later freak out your non-techy friend if it happens to be his/her Mac that you’re working on. This trick also works for any process that is running in the Terminal, e.g. emacs or vi (assuming you’ve got vi in the appropriate mode, or however it is that you people who use vi do).  <answer27230> 　 img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fYeSI.png" alt=""  　　　 OpenTerminal​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​  <answer62445> I mostly use this function:  precodecf() {   cd "$(osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)')" } /code/pre  You could also assign a shortcut to a script like the ones below.  Reuse an existing tab or create a new window (Terminal):  precodetell application "Finder" to set p to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias) tell application "Terminal"     if (exists window 1) and not busy of window 1 then         do script "cd " &amp; quoted form of p in window 1     else         do script "cd " &amp; quoted form of p     end if     activate end tell /code/pre  Reuse an existing tab or create a new tab (Terminal):  precodetell application "Finder" to set p to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias) tell application "Terminal"     if not (exists window 1) then reopen     activate     if busy of window 1 then         tell application "System Events" to keystroke "t" using command down     end if     do script "cd " &amp; quoted form of p in window 1 end tell /code/pre  Always create a new tab (iTerm 2):  precodetell application "Finder" to set p to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias) tell application "iTerm"     if exists current terminal then         current terminal     else         make new terminal     end if     tell (launch session "Default") of result to write text "cd " &amp; quoted form of p     activate end tell /code/pre  The first two scripts have a few advantages compared to the services added in 10.7:  ul liAs of 10.9, there is a bug where services that receive folders as input are never listed in the services menu in column view.

Thanks for Drag and Drop tip :) <comment164635> after couple of attempts shortcuts worked for me. Thanks again ...! <comment181950> @amar Could you share with us what you did? Also broken for me in 10.10 <comment183475> @Olive - after I upgrade to Yesomite shortcuts no longer worked for me :( <comment189546> this site should be a more appropriate place to ask though <comment200385> @jherran it seems to be ok now <comment253526> One thing I noticed, and this is with El Capitan, is that you have to select the folder in Finder (single-click on the folder that you see inside finder). The way I expected this to work is that it would open a Terminal window in the current folder. In fact, you have to select the folder within the window. <comment331963> It seems to work as @sillygwailo suggests. Though it is somehow incredibly slow. Sometimes it's faster, but it can take up to 10s for the terminal to launch. (usually takes about 5s, on a rare occasion it can randomly open instantly, sometimes seems to take even longer) <comment348132> Dead link :(. This is the reason why link only answers have a short life or should be checked regularly to stay alive. <comment353676> @daniel Substituted with archive.org link <comment361520> The accepted answer already contains information on how to use the built in service, so there is absolutely no good reason to repeat it as a separate answer! <comment363453> This works well for right-clicking on a folder icon. But it doesn't work if I want to open a terminal window in the _current_ folder. Any ideas how to do that?
