Is it possible to copy and paste iCal events in iPad / iPhone? <body> Is there any way to copy an event in iCal in iPad or iPhone and paste it to a different day? At times, I want to keep the original calendar entry, but repeat on a different day? I am not looking to use the repeat function, as that forces one to use more predictable repeat.  <answer170045> Aside of using the duplicate and repeat there is no copy/paste function.  You can submit a request for the function at http://www.apple.com/feedback/  <answer183372> I have "CalenGoo" on my iPad -- and there's a drag and copy feature which I find indispensable!!  It syncs with Google Calendar (which was why I got in the first place years ago) -- I think they have an iPhone version too, although I like how it works better on my iPad.  Check it out.  <answer197271> I think maybe Apple's team wish users use the Repeat-Custom function when adding an event to create multiple entries of the same thing. Yet, I also agree a copy/paste feature is highly lacking there...  <answer205958> A work-around:  email the event to yourself (or create a new event in a new email to yourself).  Hover the cursor over the event in that email, click the down-arrow that appears, edit the date, and then "Add to Calendar."  You can do this for as many dates as you like.  <answer224758> I was looking for this as well when trying to input my work schedule (I work in shifts). The solution I found is to manipulate the repeat function in the following manner: Add the event, select custom repeat "every month", select the applicable days of the month, and finally set the custom repeat to end on the last day of that particular month. It's a hack, but it works. One does wonder why there is no copy/paste feature though...  <answer239790> Not as such, but I'm using next workaround for non recurring events (it looks complicated, but try it out, it works quite fine):  ol liSet the event to be repeated e.g. emEvery Day/em/li liGo to the repeated event on the day you need it and set the emRepeat/em back to emNone/em and hit the emDone/em button./li liThen change the time or add a note, if needed./li liWhen closing the event, a pop-up message appears telling emThis is a repeating event/em and prompting you eighter to emSave For Future Events/em or to emCancel/em. Choose emSave For Future Events/em./li /ol  strongResult/strong: you have the event emcopied/em.  ol start="5" liNow, go back to the original event and turn the emRepeat/em function back to emNone/em./li /ol  strongResult/strong: The original event is not recurring any more.  Note: You can use the same trick to emCopy/em recurrent events as well. But then, in step 5, you need to go to the next to last of your wanted recurring events and delete it. Choose emDelete All Future Events/em.  <comment199850> Yeah - I wish too. I usually satisfy myself with just copying the main event text & pasting into subsequent days. If I'm home, alt/drag on the Mac is a whole lot easier. <comment271058> Can't email an event on the iPhone (unless I'm missing something).
