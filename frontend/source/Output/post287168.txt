Pasting large amount of files <body> Had 13000 files roughly in "all my files" category and attempted to copy and shift the files off my computer. Decided to copy in chunks of roughly 4000 files and ended up accidentally deleting the first chunk beyond recovery. Still have the remaining 9000. However from earlier I clicked copy upon all the files and have a "paste" for 13000 items.  Is there any way I can paste these inside a new folder and get my files back? Whenever I try to do so it says "pasting 9000 items" instead.  Before the chunks, When I tried copying all selected items to a new folder earlier it executed but the new folders in "info" were said to only have 4,796 items, not sure why when all were selected. Is there a cap on what you can copy and paste?  much thanks
