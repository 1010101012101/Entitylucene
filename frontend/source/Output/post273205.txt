Automator - Running Node Command in AppleScript Error <body> I am trying to run an AppleScript that runs a node command like I would run it in terminal and appear to have the right start with the code, but I'm getting hung up on Automator not recognizing the codenode/code command codesh: node: command not found/code. Can anyone point me to the reason why automator can't locate node (node command as in Node.js. Node.js is installed on my machine)?  Here is my AppleScript:  precodedo shell script "cd /Users/user/Desktop/Projects/node/cli &amp;&amp; node app.js DesktopUSA" /code/pre  <answer273217> Node isn't correctly installed or linked. Use Homebrew to correctly install Node.  precodebrew update brew doctor brew upgrade node /code/pre  Most importantly, go ahead and link node:  precodebrew link --overwrite node /code/pre  If this doesn't work, try creating a bash file and exectuing it, something like this:  precodecd /Users/user/Desktop/Projects/node/cli/ &amp;&amp; node script.js DesktopUSA /code/pre  If that works, then there is something wrong with the linking of your Node.js. If it doesn't then, Node.js isn't correctly installed.   <answer273223> The PATH variable for your AppleScript doesn't contain /usr/local/bin! You can check this with codedo shell script "env &gt;&gt; $HOME/Desktop/env.txt"/code.  So either configure an additional path or use the full path to node:  precodedo shell script "cd /Users/user/Desktop/Projects/node/cli &amp;&amp; /usr/local/bin/node app.js DesktopUSA" /code/pre  <comment343449> Is `node` installed as part of Node.js? <comment343458> @JMY1000 yes, that is correct it is for Node.js <comment343537> Thank you so much for your answer. I felt like it had to do something with telling the script where to find and access node.
