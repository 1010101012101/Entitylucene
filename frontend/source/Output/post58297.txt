MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion freezes frequently (full screen Flash in Chrome, Messages, HTC on USB) <body> Problems following an upgrade to Mountain Lion on a 13-inch, Early 2011 MacBook Pro (MacBookPro8,1 with Intel HD Graphics 3000).   With Google Chrome, I was watching YouTube video fullscreen – Flash content. In the middle of video, I wanted to exit full-screen mode but neither the keyboard nor the trackpad worked. The video continued playing fine. At last, I forced the system to close and restarted.  Today I was just chatting in Messages and suddenly everything froze. I was able to move the cursor but nothing was happening.  Has anyone else faced this issue, or found a solution?  Update: If I connect my mobile phone (HTC Wildfire S) to my MacBook Pro using USB, the Mac freezes every time while removing the USB connector.  <answer58595> h1Suspect an issue affecting the WindowServer process (long edition)/h1  ul lia more generic edition of this answer appears under How do you get system diagnostic files from OS X?/li lipower users may prefer to read nearby Suspect an issue affecting the WindowServer process (brief edition …)/li /ul  hr  The symptoms you describe are familiar but not commonplace and in my case, not frequent.   h2Prepare for diagnosis/h2  In Terminal, run the following command.

At first I thought it was Microsoft Lync causing the issue, but I've since had it with Firefox and Evernote. Upon a forced reboot all is well, but I don't like doing this. <comment67450> A very similar question but @Caesium is happy to work remotely with `ssh`. As we can't assume the same here, answers may offer a subtly different approach. <comment67452> @Vivart, please: what model is your MacBook Pro? Which browser did you use? Do you prefer Flash or HTML5 for video in YouTube? A combination of factors may contribute to this case. <comment67524> @GrahamPerrin i have 13-inch, Early 2011 macbook pro. I was using chrome browser for flash video on youtube. <comment67527> I have tried this and i got a folder in /tmp with bunch of files. <comment67548> Thanks. Did you use the Adobe Flash Player method for full screen, without full screen Safari? Or did you have full screen Safari before adding full screen Flash to the mix? Can you offer the URL of the YouTube page that was in use when the issue occurred? <comment70024> Thanks for the acceptance. If eventually you discover the cause(s) of the problem in your case, I'll be glad to know - please leave a comment either here, or under your question.
