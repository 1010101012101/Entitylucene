Dictation just stopped working <body> I've been using Dictation in TextEdit for several months now. Yesterday, out of the blue, it stopped working. The microphone icon appears and it responds to my voice, but no text appears. I've been using it with "Use Enhanced Dictation". I tried unchecking and checking again,turning Dictation On/Off, and switching languages (English (United States) and English (United Kingdom)) but this did not help. What is wrong?  <answer243100> I know you said you already tried restarting, but here are some specific steps, in a specific order, for you to try.  ol liTry turning off dictation./li liQuit TextEdit. /li liRestart your computer./li liThen turning dictation back on. /li /ol  Let us know if that helped.  <comment299185> It occurred to me that this machine has been on for over a week, so I rebooted. Then I started TextEdit and the started dictation, and a dialog box popped up that says "Downloading Enhanced Dictation". So its doing that now. We'll see if that fixes it. <comment299187> Nope that didn't do it. <comment299188> Try turning off dictation, quitting TextEdit, restarting, then turning dictation back on. Let us know if that helped. <comment299233> As I said in my comment, I did exactly that and it had no effect. On your suggestion, I did  it again. Now it works. :/ <comment299234> Please post your comment as an answer and I'll check it off.
