Purchased an entire season of a show, but newest episodes are requesting payment of $2.99 <body> We purchased 'How I met your mother, Season 8' through iTunes.  and this worked well for Episodes 1-14, however episodes 15 and 16 are not viewable, and are requesting to be purchased for $2.99/ea.    What's the best way to proceed?  The situation is the same both through iTunes and our AppleTVs.  <answer82029> Submit a Help request thru the iTunes store.  This happened to me for Archer Season 4, Episode 4.  Took about 3-4 days, and then I finally got the email saying it was ready for me to download.  Didn't happen to any of the other shows I buy.  Not sure if the Help ticket helped, but it didn't hurt...
