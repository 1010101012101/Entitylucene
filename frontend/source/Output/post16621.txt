Is it possible to be always connected to a VPN without prompting for a UN/PW? <body> Is it possible to install some configuration profile on an iOS Device that will always have the user connected to a VPN without having them input his/her username/password each time one tries to connect?  In other words, our current setup has users connecting to a VPN via the "Settings" App on the iPad (using codeIPSec/code).  With this setup, our users are prompted for his/her password each time he/she tries to connect to the VPN.  We are trying to avoid prompting for a UN/PW and having our users go to the codeSettings/code app in the first place, so is there any way to force a VPN connection, and therefore always stay connected via the iPhone Configuration Utility?  <answer16721> You can configure your server to only accept a certificate which you add to your iPad(s). That way, the user won't have to to anything special, he/she just attempts to make the connection (let's say check their email) and the connection will be made over SSL, using the certificate present on the ipad.  <answer17591> You can configure the VPN setting on your ipad, iphone or ipod touch to save the User Name and Password for VPN. I don't know of a way to have it constantly connect the VPN whenever the is a connection. Given the time it takes to establish a VPN handshake, it would be kind of frustrating to wake the device then not be able to connect to any internet/network related Apps for 15+ seconds while it connects to the VPN.   Choose Settings  General  Network  VPN  then choose the VPN Configuration. Fill in in the username a password section and then you can just turn the VPN on when you need it and not have to fill out the User Name and Password.  more info: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1424  Alternative you could look at something like Apple's Mobile Access server, to give you that secured VPN like connection all the time without the hassle of starting a VPN connection:  http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/features/mobile-access.html  <comment18165> May I ask why I got downvoted? <comment18252> +1 This might be best for ServerFault, as this might be a server configuration related question. <comment87166> Indeed the re-prompting [seems to be a server side configuration issue](https://discussions.apple.com/message/11364905#11364905). <comment89429> Mobile Access was removed in Lion Server.  The following document on Apple's support site has the details [Migration & Updating to OS X Lion](http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/lion_server_upgrading_migrating.pdf)
