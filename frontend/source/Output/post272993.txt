Clicking bookmarks in Google Chrome will blink twice before the website opens <body> I have a problem with my 2016 MBP. The problem is, when I click bookmarks in Google Chrome, the bookmark will quickly blink twice before opening the website.   I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and Google Chrome version 56 (although it doesn't seem to matter).  What's the problem? Should I go to fix my MBP, or is this normal for MacOS?   <answer273002> That's just a normal visual indication that your click was registered. Same thing happens for standard macOS menu entries when clicked, although they will only blink once.  <comment343167> when clicking the macOS entries, they will blink once, I find that too. So you think that two blinks is normal? and what about yours? Anyway, I feel it strange... <comment343195> Yes, it's normal. Happens the same for me also. It's just a stylistic choice from Google Chrome team to implement it this way. Nothing to worry about. <comment343304> Thanks for your detailed reply. But in my windows PC, I does not find any blink when clicking the bookmark in the chrome, is that particularly designed for macOS chrome?
