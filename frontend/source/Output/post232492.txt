Docking Station for 13" MacBook Pro and Surface Pro 3 <body> Is there a docking station that is compatible with both 13" Macbook Pro (2015 model A1502) and a Surface Pro 3?  I am looking for one that has  ol liConnectivity up to two monitors (DVI/HDMI/VGA)/li liEthernet adapter/li li1 USB Port/li liPortable/li /ol  Thank you  <answer232493> I have a client that has used this model docking station and he seems to really like it.  It's the Pluggable USB Docking Station.  strongUpdate:/strong  The USB docking stations in general seem to have an issue with the DisplayLink technology meaning that the dock with the exception of the display will work just fine.  From DisplayLink's website:     Known issues with DisplayLink on OS X 10.9, 10.10 and 10.11   (Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan)       The   following minor issues have been found on OS X 10.9, 10.10 and 10.11   and do not currently have a resolution:       ul   liCorruption around window borders for Carbon applications (for example Microsoft Office 2011) /li   liAfew applications can show corruption and/or missing contents while   updating windows contents. Examples are Maps, iBooks and the Dock. /li   liThe window server can crash logging our the user when minimising   applications, for example iTunes. /li   liApple menu icon misplaced on DisplayLink screens /li   liSince 10.11 El Capitan, corruption shown while mirroring DisplayLink screens  /li   /ul      The following issues have been found on OS X 10.9, 10.10 and have been resolved in 10.11:    - The Window Server crashes logging out the user during some full screen transitions, for example Show Desktop and Mission Control.       These issues are beingworked on jointly between DisplayLink and Apple.   This is an ongoing issue.  If you can live with video issues, then pretty much any USB 3.0 dock will work.  If video is super important, then you are going to need separate docks.
