Can't kill Preview app <body> I have strange problem, my Preview app is not responding and can't kill it.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2XMhJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodeleo-mac:~ leo$ sudo killall Preview No matching processes were found /code/pre  Force Quit button also doesn't give any result.  codeps/code (and Activity Monitor) is empty:   precodeleo-mac:~ leo$ ps -ax | grep -i preview 24793 ttys000    0:00.00 grep -i preview /code/pre  It's not a zombie because next command is also empty:  codeps aux | awk '"[Zz]" ~ $8 { printf("%s, PID = %d\n", $8, $2); }'/code  I really can't understand what happened. Any ideas?  <answer192467> I had the same problem. Workaround:  precodesudo killall launchservicesd sudo killall Dock /code/pre  <answer192474> It could be an issue with one of the files preview is attempting to open.  Go to   precode~/Library/Saved Application State/ /code/pre  Remove the com.Apple.Preview folder. This should resolve the issue when attempting to launch Preview after quitting the application from the above answer or shutting down.  <answer233285> I'm running OS X 10.11 "El Capitan" on my Macbook Pro, and I'm experiencing this issue with Mozilla Firefox. Unfortunately, in my case the commands codesudo killall launchservicesd/code and codesudo killall Dock/code aren't working this problem out: after I do this, I still can't e.g. reboot the operating system.  I found that the following command works:  precodesudo shutdown -r now /code/pre  strongIf your user account has administrative privileges on OS X/strong, running the above command on Terminal will force OS X to reboot. Unfortunately, this is not a solution for the issue, but as a "last resource workaround" it works like a charm.  <comment222742> Does Preview return after logging out or restarting? <comment222743> Does the problem continue after quitting the Dock process? <comment222793> @GrahamMiln, restarting helps me, however, I'm afraid this situation can repeat. I think problem is with some broken doc but I can't find out, which document it is. <comment222800> Are any Preview.app windows visible on screen when this happens – or is it only listed in the Dock? <comment222806> @GrahamMiln, only Dock. No windows, no top bar menu <comment223135> Have you tried to send the kill signal (-s 9) when using kill? The normal signal tells the process to quit graceful - the KILL signal kills it. So 'kill -s9 24739' could work. <comment223144> I had partial success after killing "launchservicesd".  The app would work again for the session, but a restart was still problematic and timed out. <comment223184> @Redarm, problem is that `kill` can't find preview by name (No matching processes were found) and Activity Monitor is also empty. Thanks, I will try to kill `launchservicesd` in the next time <comment223189> Yes, I know.  I've seen this, or similar behaviour with several different apps.   Also sometimes trying to open a recently opened document from its Dock icon, makes a pop-up appear, mentioning "The application "" is not open any more."  Quitting 'launchservicesd' made it usable again, but it still cancelled a restart. <comment223642> Just a thought: how much space (of what capacity) is free on your system disk? From my experience, low disk space tends to create strange phenomena like stuck processes.
