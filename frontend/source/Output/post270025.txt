Submitting a new version of my App in the app store <body> I have an app that I developed a little over 3 years ago built with Obj C and not using ay type of database . Over the past 6 months I redesigned (UX / UI) the app and built it from the ground up. I used swift 3 / core data and added a bunch of new features. My old app is not compatible with the new app, and I don't want to push this new version out as an update, because anyone who downloads it will lose all of their information they are currently using in the app.  What I would like to do is replace the app that is currently in the Apple App store with the new version, but I don't want this new version to show up as an update to the old app. Basically I don't want anyone who has V1 of the app installed to be able to update to V2 via the update tab on their devices.  I would like it so that if the user has V1 and they go out and download V2 they would not technically have 2 versions of the app on their iOS devices.  My question would be is this possible to do? Can I remove the old app, and replace it with the new app, and not trigger an update notification for the V1 app?  <comment339296> the answer is: No. <comment339297> Is it possible to have 2 version in the app store? <comment339298> No. Only an version 2 which is handled as an update. <comment339299> What about the App Where is my water app? There is a V1 and V2 version in the store...? <comment339300> I do not know it. Techncally you can have multible versions in the app store, if you are using different bundle identifier. But Apple might (and most probably will) reject your app.
