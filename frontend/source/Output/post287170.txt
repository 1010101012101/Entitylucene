iPhone 7 Middle East <body> I have noticed that retailers in the UAE sell FaceTime enabled or non-enabled iPhone 7. I wish to use the phone in South Africa. Will FaceTime remain disabled on the phone in South Africa. Are there any other differences between the phones that I ought to consider before purchasing?.
