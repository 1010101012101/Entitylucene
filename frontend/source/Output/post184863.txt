How do you trash items on new Mac Photos? <body> IPhoto had a trash bin, I need to delete images when and if I want, but I can't find the bin on the new Photos? The whole new system is freaking me out, I preferred the old.   <answer184865> Hit the delete key while a photo is selected or while viewing a photo. To recover photos, a "Show Recently Deleted" option is available in the File menu. On this screen you can permanently delete a photo or recover it within 30 days.  <answer216343> If you don't want to wait 30 days...  ol liSelect a photo/li liPress the "Delete" button/li liConfirm delete/li liSelect "Album" from the top of the window (see screenshot)/li liDouble click on "Recently Deleted" album to open it/li liSelect "Delete All"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNn8O.png" alt="select &quot;album&quot; segment from the top"
