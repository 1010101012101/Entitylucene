left click doesn't work trackpad <body> Hello people my (trackpad and usb-external mouse) left click doesnt work under OS and i know its not a hardware problem because the left click does work on my linux partition. I checked bluetooth connections and resetted PRAM/SMC/NVRAM. I also created a new user, didn't help. Since one hour i cant scroll up and down with my trackpad.  If you can help me or you have a good idea of fixing the problem, it would be awesome. My Macbook-Pro 15" is late 2013.  best regards  Ben
