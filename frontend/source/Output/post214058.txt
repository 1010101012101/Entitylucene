How to update Windows 7 and Parallels Desktop 9 before updating to El Capitan <body> I'm using a Mac for about 3 years now and updating OS X has never been an issue because it's free, but since I installed Parallels Desktop v9 and Windows 7 I'm reading issues about their compatibility on OS X 10.11 El Capitan where they are both not supported.  So upon coming to this issue I would rather ask an expert to tell me how to do it right and which should I upgrade first without damaging any of my files? Please kindly assist me step-by-step on how to do it properly.  <answer214060> You should probably keep your apps up to date before installing an OS that you know will be incompatible with their older versions.  ol liTake a Time Machine backup of everything./li liUpdate Parallels through this link. You'll get it for $49.99 (as opposed to $79.99) because you're upgrading from a relatively recent version./li liOpen the new Parallels and play around with your files to make sure everything works./li liOnce you're satisfied that the new version of Parallels works, take a new Time Machine backup./li liInstall El Capitan./li /ol  Good luck!  <comment258374> Well it's not necessarily just that simple.  As an example the version of VMware Fusion that's officially compatible with OS X 10.11 will not install on my current version of OS X so it cannot be upgraded first before upgrading OS X.  Unless a older app has an known conflict that can cause the OS X upgrade/update to fail or OS X not run properly once the upgrade/update is finished then it really doesn't matter which is done first.  I have many older apps running on a newer OS X and have no intension to update all my apps, only some of them. <comment258375> I just checked. Parallels 11 is supported on Yosemite 10.10.4. [Source](http://kb.parallels.com/en/123276) <comment258377> It should go without having to say however always keep regular and current backups before modifying the system, using Time Machine is a good example. **With the caveats** _unless a older app has an known conflict that can cause the OS X upgrade/update to fail or OS X not run properly once the upgrade/update is finished_ **and** _the newer app doesn't require the newer OS X_ **then it really doesn't matter which is done first**.
