Problem installing Xcode 5 - how to <body> I am not mac user for long and I am having some issues. Help would be appreciated. You probably know Xcode 5 which is free. I found it in Appstore - clicked Install. But Appstore asked me to login. I logged in with some of accounts that I had,  but then it told me to review my account since it was not used with Appstore before. And I was taken to enter credit card information. Is it not possible to avoid this step? And download Xcode directly? (since it is free).  ps. I think there are no direct download links for Xcode 5.  Thanks.  <comment136695> We probable have duplicates on the site covering a) how to fix an Apple ID for download by redeeming a gift card, entering CC or following Apple's instructions to create a new AppleID without a credit card b) How to download Xcode from the developer site. which of these would work for you? <comment136696> The instructions aren't different than this 4.4 article. Feel free to edit your question if you need more assistance and we can re-evaluate if it needs to be reopened... <comment136737> @bmike: I just want to be able to download Xcode 5 (which is free) from Appstore without entering my credit card information. Is it possible? (ps. I am not sure what "kind" of my account is, and what privileges it has) Thanks. There are no direct links for Xcode 5 I think? pps. bmike I checked the question it is for older versions of Xcode .. <comment136738> Did you try the first link in the accepted answer to the linked question? <comment136739> @patrix: No (I'm not with mac now), but on that link are Xcode versions _below_ 5 (to my strong belief) <comment136741> Maybe you should give it a try... <comment136742> I would but even on apple site you can see https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ direct link is provided only for Xcode versions below 5... I am a bit confused what to do .. <comment136744> Never mind, it is there: http://developer.apple.com/downloads <comment136745> Xcode5 can be downloaded from the developer section (as can any other version of Xcode). Reopening the question will just lead to the same answer as in the linked question. <comment136746> @grgarside: hi thanks indeed there seems to be some version (5.02) of Xcode on that link. But maybe that is not the latest?  ps. I am on fast internet connection now, if I download it and copy to my MAC machine via USB will it work this way? <comment136747> yes and yes :-) <comment136749> @patrix: Ok thanks :) so it is not the "latest" version but it is some stable version of Xcode 5 which should just do the work right?
