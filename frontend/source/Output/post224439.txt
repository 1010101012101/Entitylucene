Fix my LaunchAgents <body> I suspect because my LaunchAgents on MacBook has been interrupted this is what I get when I runâ€¦  precode$ ls -ld ~/Library/LaunchAgents lrwxr-xr-x  1 infacq  staff  46 Aug 16 11:03 /Users/infacq/Library/LaunchAgents -&gt; /usr/local/opt/mysql/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist /code/pre  When try to install other stuff using codebrew/code it will simply state missing directory. This is what I get when try to perform other stuff.  precodeERROR  watchman--no-pretty get-sockname returned with exit code null 2016-01-23T07:35:13,560: [cli] Failed to open /Users/infacq/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.facebook.watchman.plist for write: No such file or directory  Error: watchman--no-pretty get-sockname returned with exit code null 2016-01-23T07:35:13,560: [cli] Failed to open /Users/infacq/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.facebook.watchman.plist for write: No such file or directory      at ChildProcess.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/infacq/Documents/weekdays/node_modules/fb-watchman/index.js:198:18)     at emitTwo (events.js:87:13)     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:172:7)     at maybeClose (internal/child_process.js:821:16)     at Socket.&lt;anonymous&gt; (internal/child_process.js:319:11)     at emitOne (events.js:77:13)     at Socket.emit (events.js:169:7)     at Pipe._onclose (net.js:469:12) /code/pre  How do I fix this?  <answer224449> Oops is the sound your Mac is making.  I would make a Time Machine backup just in case (or equivalent).  Then you need to remove the link:  precoderm ~/Library/LaunchAgents /code/pre  Make that directory again (and optionally restore anything from your backup that is now missing)  precodemkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents /code/pre  You can then safely re-enable the mysql launch job:  precode  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents /code/pre  <comment272210> Once that is done - perhaps check things with `brew doctor` <comment272215> is that safe to perform `rm`? I have remove mysql before this. But not aware it links to the lauchAgents <comment272296> In your case, the rm deletes a symbolic link. Your system is broken specifically because what should be a folder is actually pointing to a file. The rm doesn't affect mysql or the plist file - just a pointer to that file that happens to be named LaunchAgents. I'm presuming it links since your `ls -ld ~/Library/LaunchAgents` shows me it's a link. In general the rm isn't desirable, but it's safe since a folder can't be removed with `rm` that lacks other options. <comment272327> Your title is extremely unclear. Can you be more specific with the problem you are facing? <comment272333> @grgarside The other packages are "bitching" since the directory to store other plist files isn't a directory. I would say asking for a specific brew command that fails and the error message would be useful  - but I'm fairly certain my answer will solve the issues... <comment272376> I updated my question <comment272470> @MuhaiminAbdul the answer still fits the edited question :)
