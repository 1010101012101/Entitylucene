Why is pressing = repeatedly on iPhone calculator useful? <body> Press these keys on iPhone calculator:  5 + 5 =  Unsurprisingly, the answer is 10. But keep on pressing the = sign and this is the output:  10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 â€¦ and so on  Why is this useful?  <answer295742> It's an strongauto-constant/strongbr Whether or not you find it useful depends on what you want to do.  Your method of just hitting code=/code over &amp; over just repeats the last calculation, sobr  code2 * 2 =/code 4 code=/code 8 code=/code 16 code=/code 32 etc  But, say you needed to calculate tax on a set of payments at 15%  If you want just the tax, typebr code100 * 0.15 =/codebr then your amountsbr code87.20 =/code  13.08br code43.57 =/code 6.55br code12.50 =/code 1.88 etc..br If you wanted the amount including tax, you'd start withbr code100 * 1.15 =/code &amp; off you go with your amounts, as above...  From comments - this function has been on calculators [in slightly different ways] since at least the mid-70s. It's not a new feature.br On the early ones, code2*=======/code... would quickly just codeERR/code. Since then they've got somewhat more flexible &amp; move to scientific notation.  <comment373488> I think it's important to note that this has been on calculators pretty much since the time they were digital.  I remember it being there in the early '80s. <comment373489> For sure, it's been there a long time, my 70's LED Texas did it - though surprisingly not on all & not all work the same way round. I've known my tax example to need `0.15*100=` to kick it off. <comment373490> My HP19B needed something to prime the pump as well.  Just found a video of a hack to the `=` button on a cheap calculator turning it into a counter:  https://youtu.be/VLAv7cNCB3U <comment373491> Wow... does that guy need to employ a cameraman ;) but yeah, neat idea.
