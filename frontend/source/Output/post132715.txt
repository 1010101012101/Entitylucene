Front camera on an iPhone 4S no longer works <body> The back camera works just fine but the front one does not. When I select it, it just freezes. When I quit the app and select it again it presents just a black screen; no image. I tried closing and resetting the phone but that hasn't helped.  Can anyone help me fix this in some free way?  <answer132724> Thanks to @IanC to find the duplicate, so before we close this here is the answer.  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/61350/46541     This is a hardware problem. This comes up when the ribbon connector   from the camera to the main circuit board comes loose or gets   disconnected altogether. If you have the right tools and enough DIY   skills to open up your iPhone, it's a very simple fix that should be   fairly obvious to see. Otherwise, the Apple Store should be able to   repair it for you (I would think free of charge, but who knows).      If you do want to take apart your iPhone and attempt the repair   yourself, PowerBook Medic has some really nice instructions for taking   apart all versions of iPhones from 3GS and above. They also sell   replacement parts and will repair it for you as well if you want.

I was surprised to find that [this has been asked and answered here already](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61113/front-facing-camera-stopped-working-on-the-iphone-4s). You won't get a free solution -- at the very least you need a replacement camera and some tools to do the repair. But it's not expensive to do.
