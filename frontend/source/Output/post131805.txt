Mac (OS X 10.9.2) no longer saving screen shots <body> When I try to take a screen shot (Command + Control + Shift + 4) I hear the camera shutter sound but no image appears on my desktop.  I Googled the problem and tried to change the saving location using the terminal command line as such:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/ /code/pre  but this did not change anything.  Would anyone know what I can do to fix?  <answer131812> You did all correct but missed the last line after changing the location.  To have the changes take effect, you then must type:  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <answer131814> If you have installed Dropbox it can change where/how screenshots are saved.  <answer144966>    When I try to take a screen shot (Command + Control + Shift + 4)    That's the problem. The shortcut to put a screenshot on the desktop is just Command + Shift + 4 (or 3).  Don't press the control key; when you do, it copies to the clipboard instead.  That's why you're not getting a file on the desktop.  <answer177580> On my machine this happened (OS 10.9.5) I just had to restart (not reboot) and the desktop-save was restored.  Better than that: the images that I thought hadn't been saved appeared as they should have.  <answer204359> At lease on Mac Yosemite, if you have Dropbox installed, this is a default setting in Dropbox. You can select if you want the older "put the screenshot on the desktop" method, or if you want to integrate your screenshots with Dropbox.   Go to Dropbox  Preferences  Import  Screenshots and check or uncheck the option to "Share screenshots using Dropbox". With this box unchecked, your screenshots will save to the desktop.  <answer204387> As Mark had answered, the issue with the screenshots not saving to the desktop is that the OP was using the wrong keyboard shortcut.   Command + CTRL + Shift + 4 does not save to the desktop... instead it saves to the clipboard.

Tried everything mentioned above and elsewhere. Have got it working again but only by re-programming the shortcut to Ctrl-p (reminds me of my old Microsoft days...) via System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Screenshots. Hope this helps!  <answer213050> Go to the DropBox Preferences and "unmark" 'Share screenshots using Dropbox'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/648TL.png" alt=""  <answer214265> Same problem here: I couldn't see the screenshots on the Desktop anymore (also, I couldn't see them when I viewed the code~/Desktop/code directory in the finder. However, I checked the code~/Desktop/code via the Terminal app, and everything was there (indicating that I used the correct keys).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5cAI.png" alt="enter image description here"  The simplest solution actually helped: I just relaunched the Finder and everything went back to normal!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HyNw6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer219605> I have a mac mini and my screen shot stopped working this morning. This is what I did and so far it is working: Go to system preferences click on spot light - at bottom I saw yellow warning symbols click on warning symbol new dialog appears click on (screen shots) and DESELECT ALL but third option (Save picture of selected area as a file) leave as command/shift/4  Snap shot now works and saves file to my desktop.  <answer235104> I was having this problem too, I was using Command-Shift-4, then select an area: It did the sound like it would take a screenshot of an area and save it as a file on the desktop . . . but previously it had been linked to dropbox. So because dropbox wasn't running correctly, it wasn't doing anything. I reopened the dropbox application and that got things sorted.   <answer267486> I couldn't find my screenshots either so I asked Siri on my Mac "find last screenshots" and she took me to the latest ones I had taken. From there, I went to the Finder search and I typed in the name of the last screenshot I took, which in my case was screenshot 2017... (I still had the Siri open to see the name) and I found them on the Finder. Finally, I saved the shortcut to the desktop with a button on the right hand corner and I don't know why but now they show up directly on my desktop again. Hope this helps someone :)   <answer286046> Just relaunch Finder and you'll be back to normal.  Easy peasy.  <comment154882> Two things… First, what happens when you try this? Command-Space (or click on spotlight) then type ‘screen shot’. It should show a list of all of the screen shots that you’ve taken. Then you could find out where they’re being saved by default. I’d then click on the ’show all in finder’ to get a window open which would allow you to sort. Second, instead of using ‘~’ in your defaults write, try /users/yourhomefolder/Desktop instead. I don’t think that this command understands the tilde character. <comment170756> Did you ever get a solution to this?  I'm having the same issue, and none of the solutions I found on Google have helped, either.  Repaired disk permissions, manually set the screen capture location, killed systemuiserver, rebooted... nothing.   Worth noting is that it broke *in between screenshots* - I saved one, then did another selection in a different part of the same window, and the second one didn't save. <comment170770> @MarkReed no I didnt - its still playing up. I ended up downloading the Lightshot app: https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html its a bit more user friendly too <comment170773> Found out what's going on - see my answer below. <comment246341> + from me for sharing the complete reference <comment257280> I do not see where in the question the OP said that they were using Dropbox. <comment275675> I had a similar problem. Icons were not visible in Finder, but were visible in terminal. I had around 200 screenshots on the desktop. <comment297144> Similar here: Suddenly not screenshots were saved anymore (to desktop or clipboard). But rebooting did the trick! (maybe a "restart" would have sufficed; not sure) <comment355525> Thanks. This was an important bit I missed <comment365144> Force Quit on the Finder worked for me too.
