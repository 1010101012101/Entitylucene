Stuck on FileVault login screen with never ending spinner <body> I am using FileVault 2.0 on Mavericks.   After restarting the computer one day, I was presented with the gray file vault login screen (normal). After typing in a password, it begins the login process, but then after 20 seconds or so, a spinner shows up below the account image. This spinner continues spinning indefinitely (the most I have waited at this screen is 30 minutes).  If I try holding down the power button and attempting to login again it fails no matter which user account I try.  I tried using Disk Utility to verify my disk and it shows that it is fine.  How do I fix this problem?  <answer124967> TLDR: I contacted Apple about this problem, and they recommended to reinstall OS X, which seems like a temp fix.  hr  Reinstalling OS X should at least allow you to login again. This is great if you have any data that isn't backed up. However, after a subsequent restart, I have experienced this problem again, so it seems like this only a temporary solution.   ol liRestart the computer. /li liHold command-c while it is starting up. /li liOpen Disk Utility./li liSelect the grayed out encrypted partition. /li liChoose unlock./li liType in your FileVault master password. (You saved it somewhere safe, right?)/li liClose Disk Utility. /li liChoose reinstall OS X. /li liGo through the setup process. /li liOnce it is done, you should be able to login and access all of your data./li /ol  Note: according to the Apple representative, reinstalling OS X this way does not get rid of any of the data on your hard drive.
