Set a keyboard shortcut to clear all tracks from the Up Next queue in iTunes <body> I am looking for a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to clear emall/em the tracks from  Up Next queue of iTunes. Does anyone know a way to do this?   Using Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.4  <answer101100> This following script will work on OSX &lt; 10.7.   precodeactivate application "iTunes" tell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         click (first button of scroll area 1 of window "iTunes" whose description is "up next")         delay 1         click button "Clear" of UI element 1 of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer101109> So here's a complete answer :   hr  For iTunes 11 &amp; OS X 10.6 (iTunes 11 requires at least 10.6.8) :   ul liCreate a new Automator service /li liSelect Service Receives strongno input/strong In strongiTunes/strong/li liAdd a strongRun AppleScript action/strong /li licopy the code given by adayzdone. (You may need to adapt "up next" following the language of you system. For example on my French OS X it's "suivant") /li liSave the service. /li liGo to System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts/li liIn Services, add a keyboard shortcut to your new service /li /ul  hr  For OS X 10.7 and above:  For the strongup next/strong menu iTunes 11 uses an NSPopover which is available in OS X v10.7 and later. Therefore the hierarchy of UI Elements is different from the case above.   On iTunes 11.0.5, there is a bug where the button opening the Popover has no children. Therefore it is NOT possible to access the content of the popover to click on the clear button using Applescript.   <answer101158> I found a way to do it on Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.  it uses codecliclick/code from http://www.bluem.net/en/mac/cliclick/ to simulate a mouse click at the location of the clear button. The script assuming that codecliclick/code is in code/usr/local/bin/code  This works for me on a 15 inch macbook pro retina running at 1440x900@2x   To use the script either use the instructions by Matthieu Riegler for a global shortcut or use it from the command line    The code:  precode#!/usr/bin/env osascript activate application "iTunes" tell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         click (first button of scroll area 1 of window "iTunes" whose description is "up next")         delay 1         set upNextButton to button 4 of scroll area 1 of window 1         set pos to upNextButton's position          --  160, 54  the number of pixels away the clear button is          set clearX to (item 1 of pos) + 160         set clearY to (item 2 of pos) + 54         set cmd to "/usr/local/bin/cliclick -- " &amp; {clearX, " ", clearY}         do shell script cmd      end tell end tell /code/pre  also a script for the mini player assumes that the up next list is closed   precode#!/usr/bin/env osascript activate application "iTunes" tell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         set upNextButton to (first button of window "MiniPlayer" whose description is "show up next")         click upNextButton         delay 1          set pos to upNextButton's position         --  19, 48  the number of pixels away the clear button is          set clearX to (item 1 of pos) + 19         set clearY to (item 2 of pos) + 45          set cmd to "/usr/local/bin/cliclick -- " &amp; {clearX, " ", clearY}         do shell script cmd          delay 0.1         click upNextButton      end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment118956> Are you looking for a keyboard shortcut to add selected tracks to Up Next, or to view the Up Next list? Viewing already has a shortcut - option+command+U. <comment119000> I want a shortcut to clear all the tracks from the up next queue <comment119004> I found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13659626/use-itunes-up-next-function-with-an-api which  uses gui scripting for adding a track to up next.  But it was not useful for clearing the up next queue with applescript unfortunately <comment119023> Just tried it : Very buggy. Sometimes the Up Next queue is button 4, sometimes it's button 2. <comment119024> Can be fixed within a try block <comment119027> Still doesn't work. ( 0SX 10.8.4 /w iTunes 11.0.5) <comment119028> Works in ( 0SX 10.6.8 /w iTunes 11.0.5) <comment119029> I found why it doesn't work : iTunes on OSX = 10.7 uses a NSPopover for `Up next` which is not available on 10.6 and below. <comment119031> Good work all - could someone edit the question to specify an iTunes and OS X version since there is a difference that affects the answer <comment119036> Nice work but on 10.8.4 it fails with the error after the up next button is clicked: `System Events got an error: Canâ€™t get table 1 of scroll area 1 of window 1 of process "iTunes". Invalid index.` <comment119093> I figured out a way of clicking the clear button by simulating a mouse click see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/101158/34352
