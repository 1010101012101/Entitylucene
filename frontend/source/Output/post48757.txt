iTerm2 more contrast to active tab <body> Is there a way using iTerm2 to give the active tab more contrast compared to the rest of the tabs?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNn3a.jpg" alt="showing active tab"  <answer48764> Yes, you can choose a Tab Style in the preferences, under the "Appearance" pane.  The standard styles "Metal" and "Unified" appear to offer better contrast for the active tab than the other two. From your screenshot, it appears you have selected "Adium" which does indeed have very poor contrast.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/34Aw3.png" alt="iTerm2 Preferences"  <comment55945> I just found this.  Adium was set for me by default, I never picked it.  Feel stupid for not finding it myself earlier :)
