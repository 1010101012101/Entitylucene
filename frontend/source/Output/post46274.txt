Can I use AirDrop if one or more of the participating computers is asleep/off? <body> I'm currently AirDroppping 3 very large files and I need to know if the files will continue to transfer while I'm not using one of the computers.  <answer46276> No, AirDrop requires a user to be logged in, which obviously means booted.  <answer46277> It should work as long as you have strongWake for network access/strong enabled in br strongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Energy Saver &#x2192; Battery/Power Adapter/strong.  Depending on the capabilities of your Mac, the option's description may differ:     ul   liWake for network access - Your Mac supports Wake on Demand over both Ethernet and AirPort/li   liWake for Ethernet network access - Your Mac supports Wake on Demand over Ethernet only/li   liWake for AirPort network access - Your Mac supports Wake on Demand over AirPort only      [source]/li   /ul   The option "wake for Ethernet network access" is mentioned only to round up the answer. Wake on demand for ethernet will not help if your Macs communicate using Wi-Fi.  However, you can enable AirDrop to communicate using Ethernet as well as explained here. This will also enable AirDrop on so-called unsupported Macs.  <comment71484> Okay...but what about asleep. The OP did mention asleep as well...
