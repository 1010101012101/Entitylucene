why python shell does not remember previous python shell commands/history like in windows? <body> Python Shell in windows usually remembers the history of Python shell commands, as long as same codecmd/code is open.  But even with in the same terminal session, why is Python shell not remember the older Python shell commands?  Is there a work around for this? or Am I missing something?
