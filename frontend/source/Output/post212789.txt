Can't change Finder background image <body> I can't change my background image in Finder! I keep dragging the image over, but it just doesn't seem to work, and I don't really know why. It's just a regular JPEG, but the same thing happens with a PNG. What can I do to fix it? You can see a GIF that shows what happens here.  <comment256920> Does this happen with all folders or only the standards ones (like Documents or Music)? <comment257048> I just restarted my Mac and it completely solved my problem. That's odd.
