Rootless custom scheduling of Time Machine backups <body> It has been asked how to customize the backup schedule of Time Machine, but the solutions in the answers only seem to work in releases of OS X that weren’t “rootless”, i.e. before 10.11 emEl Capitan/em (or was it 10.10 already?). The recommended tool Time Machine Scheduler also doesn’t seem to have been updated since 2013.  Is there a solution to adjust the backup intervals for current (2015+) versions of OS X?  <answer240269> You can use any of the existing solutions from the existing question Custom Scheduling of Time Machine backups by disabling System Integrity Protection first using codecsrutil disable/code in Terminal from the Recovery HD. Once the changes have been made, you can re-enable SIP by running the same command but using ‘enable’ in the place of ‘disable’, also from Terminal in the Recovery HD.  <comment295238> Disable SIP, make changes, enable SIP. <comment295249> [tag:sip] is the tag for System Integrity Protection questions. <comment295252> Indeed, there’s a quite [popular question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11) for that. I’ll keep this one open, though, in case there is (or will be) a solution without disabling SIP. <comment295253> @Crissov, At the present time there is no other solution but to disable SIP and I do not see Apple changing that any time soon.
