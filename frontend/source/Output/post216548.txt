Make Finder Windows Tiny <body> Is it possible to set OSX to allow tiny finder windows? The minimum window size on 10.9.5 is 452 x 294.  On a 30" monitor, 452 x 294 is still much larger than I need; wasting screen real estate. On some unix systems the window manager allows the windows to be quite small.  Is this possible on OSX? I've googled, searched Stack Exchange. I'm not finding anything.  This window would be just as useful at half it's current size:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKI8d.jpg" alt="Smallest possible finder window on osx 10.9"  <answer216549> Try View menuâ€¦ Hide    ul liTab Bar/li liPath Bar/li liStatus Bar/li liSidebar/li liToolbar/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSiCI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Doing that I can get a window down to this...br about 318 x 224  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8tCt.png" alt="enter image description here"
