Using Ditto across a windows network <body> I am trying to use the ditto command after connecting to a PC across a network with a shared C drive. I try:  precodeditto -V smb://10.XXX.XXX.XXX/C/users/john.smithy/documents /volumes/"macintosh hd"/users/john.smithy/documents /code/pre  but I get an error that the path can't be found!! Even though I am connected and can navigate via Finder.  Please help this hapless Windows kiddie make this command work.  <answer267438> You have to use proper capitalization because paths in arguments are case-sensitive and I'm not sure if the double quotes are set properly to escape the blank. So try instead:  precodeditto -V smb://10.XXX.XXX.XXX/C/Users/john.smithy/Documents /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/john.smithy/Documents /code/pre  or  precodeditto -V smb://10.XXX.XXX.XXX/C/Users/john.smithy/Documents "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/john.smithy/Documents" /code/pre  This doesn't apply if one or both of the em"Documents"/em folder really have the name "documents". At least the standard OS X volumes and users folder have the names emVolumes/em and emUsers/em!  <answer270137> Found the answer - as I have already connected the drive then it is a mounted drive so the correct way is:  ditto -v /Volumes/C/Users/john.smithy/Documents ~/Documents
