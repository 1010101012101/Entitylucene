Removing 3rd party extensions <body> I found that I have a lot of unknown 3rd party plugins installed in my Mac.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/otMcJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I thought they are Safari extension, but Extensions popup menu in Safari do not show these extensions.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMznI.png" alt="enter image description here"  How to remove these unknown extensions? I don't remember I install some of the extensions (especially those Chinese extensions); how come they ended up in my Mac?  <answer251955> They're built-into the OS. Just leave them switched off &amp; ignore.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k6ok3.png" alt="enter image description here"  See how to delete extensions Youku, Tudou, etc... which pretty much says the same thing. Especially pay attention to anything Linc Davis ever says; he's the closest thing to an actual authority on the Apple forums.
