Alarm clock app that utilizes gps <body> Hi I'm looking for an alarm clock app that will only stop if it detects that you have moved a certain distance (using gps).  Thanks  <comment225116> What is this meant for? Indoor GPS is generally highly unreliable, filled with false positives and false negatives, if that's applicable to your situation. <comment225117> For waking up, having the gps forces you to physically get up and move. Lots of apps just require shaking, which isn't that hard to do while in bed and then you just fall back to sleep. It doesn't have to be very accurate, as long as it knows you've moved  away from your bed, so like 10m or so? surely gps would be able to do that? <comment225120> GPS is unreliable without a clear view of the sky. It may be reliable enough for your purposes, on the other hand it may not work at all. It depends on your specific environment. One thing you can try: From your bed, load up Maps on your iPhone, get your location and look at how wide the blue circle is. This circle tells you how accurate the location is. If you're able to get your location from there without a large blue circle, then it could work, and I may be able to help. <comment225123> Okay thank you, I will try this when I get home. Also do you mean the one inside the white circle? or the pale one that pings every now and then? <comment225124> The pale one, which should be the largest circle. <comment225167> @Froggard it's massive, about 300m radius circle. Going outside didn't help at all. Maybe because it's raining hard. But I know that it kinda works okay, because I had left a running tracker on that used gps and I could see myself going into certain rooms.
