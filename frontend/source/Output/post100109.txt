Why did Apple Decide not to install Command Line Tools as default? <body> Why did Apple Decide not to install Command Line Tools which now have to be installed through xcode?  <answer100110> strongTo answer your question/strong, not many (relative term here) OS X users will install or have any need for command line tools because it is part of a larger group of tools to download. A large majority of regular, everyday OS X users won't be using these programs. However, you do not have to install codeXcode/code to install codecommand line tools/code anymore.   Sign in to Apple's Developer Downloads Page and then search for codeCommand Line Tools/code.  Download and install the latest as a code.dmg/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/butgF.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongRelated Question/strong: How to download the Command Line Tools for Xcode without the Downloads for Developers webpage?  h2Alternative Way/h2  As referenced from a Stack OverFlow post, here is an unofficial link to the March 2012 Command Line Tools for Xcode.   <comment117833> Most of the binaries are already included in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/{Tools,usr/bin}`, and you can use commands like `xcodebuild -find SetFile` to find paths to them.
