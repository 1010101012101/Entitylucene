Preview: Opening more than 12 pdf files in new windows <body> I've noticed that whenever I have strong12/strong or more pdf files open at one time (each in a separate window) and attempt to open an emadditional/em pdf, this additional pdf opens in the emsame window/em as the pdf on top. In other words, it's as if the "Open each file in its own window" is disabled once I reach strong12/strong open pdfs.  I can then emtransfer/em the newly-opened pdf to a new window by right-clicking on the pdf's thumbnail and selecting "Open in New Window" but I don't want to have to do that every time I want to open an additional file. Does anyone know how I can make this happen?  Again, I already have the "Open each file in its own window" option enabled (and it works when I have less 12 pdfs already opened).  Lastly, assuming this is deliberate on Apple's part (i.e. not some sort of bug), is there a reason why I should be wary of opening up more than 12 pdfs in separate windows? And what other options are there for opening up pdfs in OS X other than via Preview? (I'm sure there are plenty of third-party apps available but I'm particularly interested in built-in alternatives).   Thanks.  [Note: A similar issue was mentioned here: Difficulties opening PDFs in Preview but the solution offered doesn't apply.]  OS X - Macbook Pro;br Version 10.9.3  [EDIT: This behavior has occurred periodically for a while now (months)--it seems to occur emafter/em I've opened files in Preview that have been emsaved as PDFs/em via the "Save as PDF" option from the "Print" window.]  <answer133019> You can use the mastodont emAdobe Reader/em.  In fact, this app from Adobe, formerly named Acrobat, was the app provided in Macs, before Preview existed.  <comment157520> I do not have this behaviour on 10.9.3. Which implies the issue is local and not a deliberate behaviour.   Please add what Mac version and Operating version you are using. <comment157522> How did you test to see if you had this behavior? <comment157636> I opened 12 pdfs from a folder. Once each opened in it's own window I opened some more by double clicking them. I also just test from the Web Receipts folder, same result
