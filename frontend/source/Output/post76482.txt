iphone 5 ipod touch <body> I plugged in my iPhone 5 to my computer for the first time and I chose to restore it with the information from my iPod touch, but I lost the pictures that I had on the iPhone. I wanted to know if there was anyway to get those back?  <comment88697> Nope. You erased what was on your iPhone by restoring it. <comment88700> Okay thank you! <comment88702> Did you enable Photostream previously on your iPhone?
