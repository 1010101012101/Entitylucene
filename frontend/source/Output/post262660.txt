Regular/periodic pauses for unbuffered videos on mbpro / El Capitan <body> Video is pausing/freezing up for approximately 250ms periodically every 1 to 1.5 seconds.  This behavior is occurring in Flash and youtube across almost all websites. An exception: Netflix is not affected due to its buffering of the fast incoming signal.  As shown in the screenshot I have excellent internet connectivity: 100mbps with 1ms latency.   These numbers were tested on both chrome and firefox.  Note: the speedtest itself was getting the emsame pausing/freezing behavior/em - even while reporting up to 110mbps!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXCgh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The cpu level is low &lt; 20% and there is free RAM available on my core i7 2.3GHz 16GB  retina display machine.  This behavior seems to briefly be mitigated after a fresh reboot: but soon continues again. Stopping/restarting the browsers (tried Chrome, safari, ff) has NO effect.  The behavior has been ongoing for weeks at the least.  <comment329196> What web browsers are you using? <comment329245> @IronCraftMan  chrome, ff, safari  (updated OP)
