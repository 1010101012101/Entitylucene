Black borders on sides of 2nd external monitor with new Macbook Pro 15" Retina <body> I just began using a new Macbook Pro 15" with Retina Display running Mountain Lion. Since it has 2 thunderbolt ports, I decided to try hooking up two external monitors. Both monitors are the same Dell model (24" diagonal, 1920x1080 resolution).   I hooked up the first monitor with a Thunderbolt-to-DVI adapter and the picture looks fine. I hooked up the second with a Thunderbolt-to-VGA adapter and the picture on this monitor doesn't fill the screen. Instead, there is a black vertical border about 3/4" wide on both the right and left edges of the screen area. Also, I had to manually set the resolution to 1920x1080, as my Mac defaulted to 800x600. This didn't happen with the first monitor I hooked up. I checked the monitor for settings that would allow me to adjust the picture size and perhaps expand it to fill the screen area, but there don't seem to be any.   Any ideas on how I can get the second monitor to use the full screen area?  <comment117370> What refresh rate is the monitor running at? It is possible that the adaptor is not displaying the picture correctly because of this. <comment117454> It's running at 60Hz. I checked the other monitor as well (the one that's working fine) and the refresh rate is not listed for that one. Instead, in the menu area where the 2nd monitor says "Resolution: 1920x1080@60Hz" the 1st monitor just says "Resolution : 1080p". Does that hold any clues to the problem I'm having? <comment117520> What happens if you use all the cables from the first display on the second? Does it report 1080p ? Its possible the vga cable and adaptor might have issues. I've had this happen a lot.
