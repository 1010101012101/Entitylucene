Logitech mouse jerky cursor <body> I got a new Logitech G402 mouse which replaced a G400. The G400 mouse worked fine and as expected but became defective. The G400's cursor was smooth in OSX, Windows and Ubuntu.   The G402 now is still smooth in Ubuntu and Windows 7. But on OS X El Capitan, things are very choppy or jerky. The mouse will usually be fine for a while, then the mouse stops working for a moment and suddenly works again after a while. This makes the mouse impossible to use.   I have many other mice like the Razer Mamba and a dell mouse and they work fine. It's just this one logitech (G402).   Does anybody know what I can do?
