Finder Problems after Updating to Yosemite <body> I updated to Yosemite from Mavericks. Everything seems to be working normally, except codeFinder/code. When I open a codeFinder/code window it is empty. Even if I open the codeApplications/code folder - it is empty.  The files on my desktop also look normal. When I open Pages and then go to open a file I can then navigate to i.e. my codeDocuments/code folder and I see all the files normally. Just when I use codeFinder/code directly it does not display anything.  I created a folder on my desktop and placed a file in it. When I opened the folder I could not see its contents. Once I codechmod 777/code the folder using terminal - I was able to see everything.  Shared folders on the network however display files correctly. I am assuming something is wrong with the permissions of the user.  I tried rebooting with codeCMD/code codeAlt/code codeP/code codeR/code and also booted into the recovery partition and repaired the user permissions. I even deleted the codeFinder/code preferences plist - no luck.  I tried googling, but I could not find similar situations - any ideas?  Thanks  <comment181562> Do other user accounts have the same issues? <comment181563> There is no other user account on the mac <comment181564> "I as able" should spell "I am able" ? <comment181577> Added a user account - and that user can see all files. <comment181625> Have you tried a 'Fix Permissions' in disk utility? <comment181677> yes... had no effect. <comment183285> Lots of discussion here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6632605?start=0&tstart=0 ... no real solutions so far, but switching Finder into the "List" view is a good workaround for now.
