Avoid iPhone lock on iPod sleep <body> Is there a way to prevent the iPhone from locking when "Sleep iPod" is activated as a timer?   I have this alarm clock app (SleepCycle) that needs to be running on an unlocked iPhone to pick up movement during the night. If I also want to listen to music or an audiobook while falling asleep, I set the clock timer to sleep iPod after a certain interval, but this seems to also lock the iPhone, even if I've set auto-lock to never. Any ideas?  <answer5905> Maybe you can ask the developer of SleepCycle to put some iPod scheduling controls into the app? That seems like the best solution.  I do know of one other solution, but I'm afraid it's a Jailbreak app. There's a paid app in Cydia called codeSBSchedule/code, which (when combined with the free codeSBSettings/code and codeSBSettings iPod toggle/code) can toggle the iPod off on a schedule.  <comment3849> I don’t believe that theres a way to avoid that. If the application doesn’t do it on its own, you are out of luck. <comment3858> @Martín Marconcini: Thanks, I didn't expect it either, but it never hurts to ask...=) The app stays unlocked most of the time on its own, but the Sleep iPod defeats it every time...=( <comment3867> May I suggest you contact the author of the application, maybe he/she can do something about it :) <comment6117> Thanks @Tim, I just fired off an e-mail to the SleepCycle developer, let's see if it works. Great that there's an alternative, but I prefer to run my phone non-jailbroken. Currently my solution is listening to a short playlist or just the end of one so that it automatically goes quiet...=) <comment6187> Maybe you could create a Smart Playlist that's limited to last only a certain length of time?
