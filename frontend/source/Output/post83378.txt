How Do I use the Logitech G600 mouse with my Macbook pro? <body> How do I make all the buttons work, how do I configure different modes on this gaming mouse?  I've tried steermouse but that did no good for me? Any help with this will be awesome, I plan on using it for my mac's Guild wars 2.  P.S I run Mountain Lion 10.8.2  Thanks  <answer83383> Personally, I stopped using the Logitech drivers with my Logitech mouse and installed USBOverdrive instead. It's a great USB driver that gives you total control over all the buttons on your mouse.  USBOverdrive website  Any button can be linked to all sorts of system functions, keys, scripts, etc.  <comment96502> +1. I'm also using USB Overdrive, with a Logitech MX310.  Works great.
