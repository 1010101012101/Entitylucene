Mounting Time Machine .sparsebundle fails <body> I have a Time Machine backup volume that is not mountable anymore. I tried to repair it with:  precodefsck_hfs -drfy /dev/disk1s2 /code/pre  It showed the following error:  precode** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume. Invalid catalog PEOF (4, 0) ** The volume   could not be verified completely. volume check failed with error 7  volume type is pure HFS+  primary MDB is at block 0 0x00  alternate MDB is at block 0 0x00  primary VHB is at block 2 0x02  alternate VHB is at block 399999998 0x17d783fe  sector size = 512 0x200  VolumeObject flags = 0x07  total sectors for volume = 400000000 0x17d78400  total sectors for embedded volume = 0 0x00  CheckHFS returned -1317, fsmodified = 0 /code/pre  How can I repair it and retrieve the data from the last backup?
