Clone one Mac and restore it on multiple Macs <body> I am going to setup a bunch of MacBooks Pros with the same settings. I could go through every Mac and install all the programs but here is what I would like to do.  I would like to setup one Mac with the appropriate settings and programs. Then clone the drive to an external hard drive and then just restore that drive to each and every MacBook.  I am completely new to this and have messed about in Disk Utility for hours without getting this to work. I have also read a lot of articles online that are way too simplified.  I actually managed to make an image file of the drive and restore it, but this makes the Mac un-bootable. Basically the Mac gets stuck in an eternal boot loop.  Could someone with experience please give me a mini tutorial on how to clone one Mac to multiple Macs with an external hard drive?  <answer287498> h2On the Mac that you wanted to clone/h2  ol liConnect an external Hard Drive to your Mac./li liOpen Time Machine in System Preferences and setup the backup of your system.  This may take some hours depending on your type of external drive./li /ol  h2On the other Mac where you want to transfer that clone/h2  ol liShut down the system/li liConnect the Time Machine backup disk created earlier/li liPower on Mac whilst holding the strongCommand + R/strong buttons. This will take you to recovery./li liChoose Restore from strongTime Machine backup/strong and press Continue./li /ol  This will make an exact clone of the first Mac. For other systems also follow the same steps.  <answer287505> h3Use codedd/code to make a clone of your drive./h3  codedd/code will make a bit for bit copy (meaning an exact copy) of the drive; so whatever you have on the source, it will be exactly replicated on the target.  One caveat is that your target must be the same size or larger than the source.  Before you begin you will need to know what your disk identifiers are.  Open Terminal and type codediskutil list/code to get a listing of all your connected devices.  Find the drive attached to USB and make a note of it's identifier; it will be code/dev/diskX/code where codeX/code is some integer.  ol listrongMake an image of the source drive./strong  Using codedd/code make an image and save it to your Desktop to be reused for each clone. I will be using codedisk5/code and your codeDesktop/code as examples. Be sure to change these values to whatever is specific to your environment.  codesudo dd if=/dev/rdisk5 of=~/Desktop/source.img bs=1m/code  This copy process may take a while depending on how large your drive is and how fast your USB connection is (USB 2.0 or 3.0).  Once the process has finished, remove your USB source disk and replace it with a target/li listrongCreate the target from the image./strong  codesudo dd if=~/Desktop/source.img of=/dev/rdisk5 bs=1m/code  Once that has finished, remove the newly created disk and install in your Mac /li listrongRepeat Step 2 as necessary/strong/li /ol  You will notice that I used the disk identifier code/dev/rdisk/code; this is not a typo  This allows you to access the "raw" device (direct access to the actual disk itself).  This enables faster access to the device.  strongRecommendation:/strong  IMO, I wouldn't use a MacBook Pro to do the imaging (steps 2 &amp; 3).  Personally, I would use a desktop PC (Mac Mini works as well) and connect the drive to the secondary SATA port; it will make the process go much, much faster.  Using a cheap PC with FreeBSD or Linux (I prefer FreeBSD), you can use the exact same codedd/code command to image the drive.  <comment363043> A migration assistant restore from Time Machine will be a very close clone, but not an *exact* clone. In most cases, this won't matter, but saying it's an exact clone isn't entirely precise. <comment363103> It seems, somehow I made it work with just Disk Utility, but it was a hassle. Next time I will try your solution and come back to accept your answer if it works. <comment363133> You *can* use DU, but like you said it was a hassle.  Cloning multiple drives for *deployment* is getting into Sys Admin territory and this is a good practice for that type of activity <comment363138> In step 1, how can i select which partition on the disk I would like to store the image on? <comment363141> Use the identifier `diskXsY` which means disk X *slice* Y.  So if you want the 2nd partition on the 3rd disk, you would use `disk3s2` <comment363258> We are not using migration assistant here, we are restoring whole drive as it is. In the case of migration assistant it clones only users home folder, but using Whole systems Time Machine Backup restores everything.
