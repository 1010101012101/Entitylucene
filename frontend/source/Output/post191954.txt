Have Microsoft Word 2015 remember spelling and auto correct preferences <body> How can I have Microsoft Word actually remember my settings for spelling and auto correct? I am using the Microsoft Word 15 (Preview).  I untick all these preferences every single time. Word refuses to remember the settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R91OE.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fBQa3.png" alt="enter image description here"  And every single time I reopen Word, they are ticked again.  <comment228146> Perhaps that feature is just missing from the beta version:-) <comment228147> @TomGewecke Haha, it never even occured to me. It _is_ a preview I'm running. <comment230065> I updated to a newer version of the Preview and now it works as expected.
