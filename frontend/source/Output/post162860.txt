How to view current display resolution <body> How can I find out the current resolution the screen is running at, in OS X 10.10?  Under settings - display (which is where I think it used to be), it shows the refresh frequency, but not the resolution.  Using the monitor's controls, I can see it's running at 3840x2160, but how would one find this out from OS X?  <answer162861> You go to apple menu - about this mac, and there is a Displays tab with the information.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nptjd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer177757> You can see the current resolution in the Display system preferences.  On a Macbook .. Retina, If you have strongscaled/strong selected for strongresolution/strong  Hover your mouse over the current scaled selection and the resolution will be shown.  If you have  default selected for strongresolution/strong then the resolution is not shown.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/67agi.png" alt="enter image description here"  ( I cannot check my non retina desktop at the moment)  But either way you could run this Applescript/Objective - C script from your Applescript Menu or from Script Editor.  precode    use framework "CoreGraphics"     use scripting additions      set sizes to item 1 of (current application's NSScreen's mainScreen's frame as list)      set theRez to ("width:" &amp; width of |size| of sizes &amp; " x height:" &amp; height of |size| of sizes) as string   display dialog theRez with title "Main Screen Rez" buttons "OK" /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ulktv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment190547> from OS X? do you mean from Terminal, and not using about this mac, or opening syst preferences? <comment190796> Using about this Mac is fine, I hadn't found that before. <comment210353> That does not show the current resolution. Just the max resolution that the connected monitor can handle. <comment210398> It does not tell you the current resolution
