How should I uninstall a static ffmpeg binary? <body> I've downloaded ffmpeg static binary. If I wanted to 'uninstall' it from my computer, is deleting the static binary enough ?  My understanding is that static binary contains all of the required libraries/code within itself and therefore it does not need to 'install' itself per seâ€¦ Am I correct in saying that ?   So I never compiled it, never used homebrew, just downloaded the file, extracted it to downloads folder and used it to convert videos.  <answer225366> Yes, since you didn't install either via script, a package manager or an code.pkg/code you can simply delete the file and you're done.
