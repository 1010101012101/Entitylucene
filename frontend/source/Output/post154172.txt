Unable to change the order of widgets in Yosemite Notification Center Today View <body> I tried clicking on Edit and then dragging the widgets around. I also tried doing so from the System Preferences Extensions pane. And either ways, I am successfully able to change the order in which the widgets show up. However, once I restart my computer, they go back to where they were before I made the changes.  This is what my (widgets') order defaults to all the time:  strongSocials - Calculator - Calendar - Weather - Reminder (emI have turned off Stocks and World Clock as I don't need them/em)/strong  Whereas, I want them in the following order:  strongSocials - Reminder - Calendar - Weather - Calculator/strong  It's mighty annoying because it's natural one would prefer to have Reminders on top of the list as it definitely has a higher priority over Calculator! Anything to fix this bug or am I the only one facing it?  <answer173901> I was having the exact same problem, and I think it started after installing an app which included a Today widget. I've finally fixed it by trying a few things, so I'm not sure what actually solved the problem. I suggest you try these things in the same order:  ol liOpen the emTerminal/em (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and paste the following lines there, then hit [Enter].  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/\ LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local\ -domain system -domain user -seed /code/pre  This will rebuild the app cache, which includes all extensions./li liA few extensions will probably be missing now (in the emExtensions/em preference pane). That is no big deal; just quit and open all apps that come with extensions. Logging out and back in would do the trick too./li liGo to emSystem Preferences/em  emExtensions/em  emToday/em, and reorder the items to your liking. Make sure you strongkeep all checked items together/strong and strongmove them to the top of the list/strong! I suspect the Today view could get confused when enabled widgets are mixed with disabled ones./li liLog out and back in and see if the widget order is correct./li /ol  Hopefully, this approach works for you too.  <comment216290> You might as well ignore this answer, because today the order of my widgets was messed up again. Ugh, it seems we have to wait for an OS X Update that addresses this bugâ€¦
