Is it possible to change a Time Machine backup password without wiping backup history? <body> I've got a few Macs that target a Time Machine share on a NAS.  We changed a few passwords and now the Time Machine backup fails with     'Time Machine couldn't complete the backup to ""      The network backup disk could not be accessed because there was a problem with the network username or password. You may need to re-select the backup disk and enter the correct username and password'   If I reselect the backup disk and type the new credentials, it wipes the backup history and starts from scratch.  Is there anyway round this and just retype the credentials?
