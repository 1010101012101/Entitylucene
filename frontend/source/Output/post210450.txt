Operation not permitted turning off airplay mirroring <body> I'm running the command sudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/AirPlayUIAgent  Because airplay mirroring is messing with one of my programs, but it tells me Operation is Not Permitted. I'm the owner of this mac and should definitely be permitted, some help please? Thanks in advanced.  <answer210458> You'll need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).

If so, did you turn of SIP? <comment253994> Yeah I have El capitan, what's SIP? (I'm new to mac) <comment253998> SIP (aka rootless) aims to stop you from doing what you're doing (as well as other applications). It stops anything from modifying System files.
