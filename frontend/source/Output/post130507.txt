iMessage sync with computer after deleting <body> If you send a text on your iphone and then immediately delete it while the synced Mac computer and ipad is off/not connected to Wifi, will the messages still appear in chat on the Mac when you connect it?  <answer130707>    When the iMessage is send, then its sent.   So when you activate iMessage again on this other "Computer" (Mac, iPad, iPhone), then it appears. It could be that after a certain amount of days, the message is deleted from Apples Server.  <comment153331> Let us know if http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/76534/ or http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/68664 or http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51347 doesn't cover your question sufficiently.
