Slideshow display in Aperture <body> Having had a certain amount of frustration with the iphoto-11 slide show dept, I decided to get Aperture and see if the grass was greener on the other side.  I imported the whole shebang, and my slide shows obediently waddled across into Aperture. The pictures look normal in the small images in the bottom, but previewing or playing in Aperture shows a 'pixelated' effect in which the picture is split into many small squares, resulting in terminal fuzziness. Is this a display artifact, or an import problem, or just a setting hiding in Aperture somewhere that is trying to conserve CPU or something?  <comment7915> Pix pls. Screen caps will help us identify the problem. Also, can you try exporting? Is the problem still there? <comment7917> Since it's still throbbing 'processing,' I'm going to wait (perhaps until tomorrow) to see if this is a temporary phenomenon. If so, I'll delete this. If not, I'll post a capture. <comment8376> Any news on this one? <comment8384> Yes. After 12 more hours of cogitation, it now displays images normally.
