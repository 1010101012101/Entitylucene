The pixels are still displaying the image but there is no power to the device so nothing is backlit. Additionally, if you cannot get your device to boot, it is likely that something related to the power distribution has caused the device to stop working. No power = no boot. (This post reminds me of an old iPod video I used to have)  How do you charge your iPad? Does the bottom of the power brick say "10W USB Power Adapter"? If not, then that throws up a red flag right there.  Has your iPad been exposed to humidity or moisture (liquids) of any kind?  Has your power supply (the power to the building that powers the socket) experienced an outage or surge recently?  Any of these things could have caused the problem you are experiencing. Then again, it could also be something related to the display connection, firmware, etc.  <comment38239> Tried those steps. I think the only way to get outta this is the Apple Store.
