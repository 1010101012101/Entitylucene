Is it possible to trick Bootcamp to allow 32bit Win7 installation? <body> I have a Macbook Pro retina laptop which I want to dual boot windows 7. I have the bootable USB, but bootcamp does not start installation since it reads it 32-bit windows.  I know in other MacBooks you can install 32-bit, Is it possible to change info.plist file and continue installation.  (USB contains both 32 and 64 bit windows)  <comment140648> What's the problem with 64bit if you have both? <comment140649> As I mentioned above usb contains both setup files but bootcamp recognises usb as 32-bit.
