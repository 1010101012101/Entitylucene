My whole startup disk has gone blank <body> After a botched arch Linux install, my whole ssd got wiped. I used a bootable USB drive for Ubuntu to see what happened and saw that all my partitions from the SSD had vanished and the drive was showing up as free space. I am loading up internet recovery but I am not sure what I'll do there.  Everything went to hell after I typed  codeparted mklabel gpt /dev/disk2/code or something similar along these lines.  I don't care about recovering my data but all I want is my MacBook to boot up again  System: MacBook Pro Retina Display late 2011  <answer249364> Granted that gparted didn't erase/secure erase data (overwriting important parts of your disk with zeros or arbitrary data) you probably can recreate the old standard GUID partition table which follows a fixed Apple scheme. gparted or similar gpt partitioning executables usually only modify the first and last 34 blocks (512 B) or 6 blocks (4096 B) of a disk.   The strongfast/strong approach below won't work, if you've modified the disk previously (e.g installed Windows, resized the main volume strongand/strong added a second partition). It only works with the "vanilla" OS X install partition scheme.  Recreating the old GUID partition table should restore the previous volume(s). Here is a related answer: HFS+ invalid number of allocation blocks.  The standard Apple GUID partition scheme looks like that:  precode                0           1         PMBR                 1           1         Pri GPT header                 2          32         Pri GPT table                34           6                         40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B            409640  part2-size      2  GPT part - partition type part2-size+409640     1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC     total_size-40           7              total_size-33          32         Sec GPT table      total_size-1           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  Here emtotal-size/em is the total size of the disk in 512 B-blocks. empart2-size/em usually is emtotal-size - 1679216/em in 512 B-blocks.  The partition type of the second partition is either 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC (CoreStorage) or 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC (HFS+).  Newer systems on SSDs preferably have a CoreStorage- and older systems on HDDs an HFS+-type main partition.  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liDetach any external drive/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.   The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan).

I've seen nix installers completely wipe & repartition the drive for their own use. What you do next depends on how recent your backup is. <comment309265> @Tetsujin what if I don't have another backup. <comment309271> @klanomath All my data HAS been erased and I don't care at this point, just want my MacBook to boot up again <comment309273> @klanomath how would one do that? You have given me hope :) <comment309276> @klanomath Yes it did. The installed OSX was el Capitan 11.2 I think. I am not sure about the version number but surely was el Capitan <comment309277> http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/206593/100047 I found your answer in another thread, is this what I have to do? <comment309278> @user2758186 It's similar yes. But I'm already writing an answer - which will take some time <comment309279> alright thank you so much! <comment309282> I ran into something similar the other day.  What I did was boot a Live USB version of Linux (Ubuntu) and format the disk ExtFAT with an MBR partition.  Once I did that, the OS X installer was able to find and partition the disk normally. <comment309286> +1 as always. You're good at this stuff :) I do hope if ever I have an unbacked drive fall over at any point in future you're still here to help out. <comment309288> @Tetsujin My current average live expectancy according to [Statistisches Bundesamt](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Homepage.html) is 14.4 years. On the one hand I'm smoking - so it might be less - on the other hand I had a dream that I will die as a 93 year-old... ;-) <comment309289> Dammit... I *might* just outlive you.... well, maybe if I give up smoking. I'm hoping for the 'out of bell-curve' too, I'm thinking 117 might be a decent age to finally retire :) <comment309339> wow thanks for the help! I have an exam tomorrow so I have to study for it. I will definitely try this out tomorrow though. <comment309341> who cares about the exam. I did what you said and my MacBook works! I think I formatted my drive a while back because the data isn't there but all is fine. <comment309342> @user2758186 Did you get a `diskutil cs list` output?
