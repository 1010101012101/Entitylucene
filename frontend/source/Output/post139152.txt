Can I give something using my iTunes gift card? <body> I want to give strongan itunes movie/strong to a friend but can I use the credit I have on my iTunes gift card?  <answer139154> You should be able to click the strongpresent/strong option or stronggive to a friend/strong or whatever it is called. You pay, so it works without any problem.  Why would you think using a prepaid card like that does not work? It's a great method used  worldwide by people who don't have a credit card, or do not want to  link them.
