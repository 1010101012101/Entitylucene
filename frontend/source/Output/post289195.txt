How can I find out which Mac apps are 32-bit? <body> On June 28, 2017, Apple announced that     macOS High Sierra will be the last macOS release to support 32-bit apps without compromise.   How can I find out which apps on my Mac are 32-bit so that I can see if I need to upgrade them?  <answer289196> One way to identify what 32-bit apps you're still using is to use the System Information option under About This Mac. The exact steps differ depending on the version of macOS you're running, but below are the broad steps you should be able to follow to suit your circumstances:  ol liClick on the Apple Menu/li liSelect About This Mac/li liIn the About This Mac window that pops up, click on the kbdSystem Report.../kbd button at bottom left (if you're using an older OS, you may need to click on the kbdMore Info.../kbd button near the centre bottom)./li liThis opens up the System Information window (or System Profiler window in older versions of the OS). /li liIn the Sidebar on the left you will see a number of headings and subheadings./li liUnder the Software heading (it's the 3rd one down) you'll see a subheading labelled Applications. Click on this./li liIn the main part of the window on the right-hand side you will see a list of apps appear. strongBe patient/strong as this may take a little while to populate./li liOnce the list appears, you'll see column headings at the top. /li liThe last column is labelled code64-Bit (Intel)/code Click on this column heading to sort apps by whether or not they're 64-Bit (i.e. they'll have either a emYes/em or emNo/em listed against each app). /li /ol  Refer to the image below as an example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NvjW2.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongNOTE:/strong In the above image I've deliberately not sorted the last column so you can see entries with both a Yes and No listed against them. So, in the example above you'll see that iMovie v10.1.6 is a 64-Bit app while iMovie 9.0.9 is not 64-Bit.  <answer289197> In the Finder hit kbdcmd/kbdkbdF/kbd to get a search window.  ul liChoose Search: This Mac/li liHit the first search criterion and choose "emOther.../em" and here "emExecutable Architectures/em" "emIs/em" "emi386/em"/li liHit the + button and add a second criterion "emExecutable Architectures/em" "emIs not/em" "emx86_64/em"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xg8ii.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  and you will get a list of all i386 only (i.e. 32-bit) apps.  hr  In Terminal this is done with:  precodemdfind "(kMDItemExecutableArchitectures == 'i386') &amp;&amp; (kMDItemExecutableArchitectures != 'x86_64')" /code/pre  <comment365317> Strangely for me, this method picks up a few PDF files from years ago, like "Welcome to Leopard". Otherwise seems to be working fine. <comment365319> Are they going to be making their own 64-bit video card? <comment365326> What, exactly, do you mean by "64-bit video card", @Physics-Compute? I assume you're referring to the memory bandwidth? That has nothing to do with the bitness of the processor or supported by the operating system. You don't need a 64-bit video card on a 64-bit OS; in fact, 64-bit video cards work fine on 32-bit OSes (which *isn't*, of course, true of apps). <comment365349> @CodyGray I would assume it is referring to the number of address bits it supports for DMA operations. It is a problem if you have more memory than can be addressed with 32 bits and you have allocated a buffer for DMA which you need to tell a piece of 32-bit hardware about. <comment365362> @Thunderforge "Welcome to Leopard" is not a .pdf but an app IIRC, when you open it it chooses your language pdf and opens it in Preview. <comment365366> @Manuel Interesting! I was thrown off by the fact it has a PDF icon. Didn't even occur to me that it was actually an app that picked a PDF for you. <comment365367> Sorry, I more precisely meant 64-bit drivers. Aren't the graphics drivers overwhelmingly 32-bit, which necessitate all processes that use them to be 32 bit mode as well? A process that is typically 64bit today needs to use IPC with a 32bit process to talk to the 32bit video card drivers. Not allowing 32bit drivers or processes seems like an issue if video card makers haven't made 64bit drivers, no? <comment365370> Related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/96543/24330 <comment366390> Video drivers cannot possibly be 32-bit, as a 64-bit kernel cannot load/use 32-bit drivers. Video card manufacturers have been producing 64-bit drivers for some time, and they have to do this for other operating systems, too, so it's not exactly a crazy proposition. And the driver would handle the DMA stuff that kasperd is talking about, so that's a non-issue as well.
