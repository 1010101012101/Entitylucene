Adding custom .dic to ~/library/spelling <body> I am trying to add my custom word list to the public spelling files. I see the local dictionary file here and the custom dic file I copied to the folder.  However, when I go to keyboard - text -spelling to try to select my .dic file, it is not listed there.  I also tried just opening the local dictionary file and copying my custom terms there but the speller wont recognize them.  What am I do wrong and how do I fix it?  My custom dictionary is about 100,000 terms and I am using the latest OS version.  <comment373360> How did you make the file?  Do you have any problem with .dic and .aff files downloaded from a standard source, like https://github.com/titoBouzout/Dictionaries   ? <comment373361> I believe I originally used on Windows and copied the file from there.  It works fine if I point to it in Mac Word. I will test a .dic from the source you referenced. If that works, how would I convert my .dic to work?  Thanks! <comment373362> Sorry, forgot to add, the list was an accumulation over years working for my company.  So simply adding terms to custom dictionary, and then copying the file and dropping on Mac. <comment373810> Can anybody help? <comment373811> What happened with the test from a standard source?
