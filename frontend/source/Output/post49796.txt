Image Capture "Delete After Import" Disappeared <body> There used to be a checkbox when I import pictures from my camera that said "delete after import" or something like that. It's not there anymore. Any ideas?  <answer49817> If the media is write protected, or if the device is not providing full USB drive functionality, then deletion would not be possible and so might not be offered.  <answer173676> Its an update to Image Capture.  If Apple detects you use iCloud (which everyone does) it disables delete after import, as this would not require you to keep the storage on your phone and iCloud backup, and they would miss out on money.  So basically Apple removed the option.  You can tell when the program starts the option shows, then a split second later, when the iCloud icon shows up next to the device, magically the delete after import option is gone.

No idea... <comment204345> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment325267> the workaround seems to be to turn off the icloud photos both on iphone & osx
