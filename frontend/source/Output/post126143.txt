How can I use an app after installing it via `brew pull`? <body> Because of a reinstall of the OS and a not perfectly migration of my data I had to reinstall a few things. Under these things were homebrew and truecrypt.  codebrew doctor/code doesn't show any problems now. Only when I tried to install truecrypt. I know there is a version with codebrew cask/code. But I don't like the visual interface so I decided to search just with codebrew search/code for it. I show you what I did:  First I searched for truecrypt. Found it and installed it:     codeNewton:local hendrikwindel$ brew search truecrypt   No formula found for "truecrypt".   Searching pull requests...   Open pull requests:   truecrypt: Initial formula for version 7.1a (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/24078)/code      codeNewton:local hendrikwindel$ brew pull https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/24078/code   code#################################################################### 100,0%   ==&gt; Applying patch Applying:    truecrypt: Initial formula for version 7.1a/code      code/usr/local/.git/rebase-apply/patch:96: trailing whitespace./code      code/usr/local/.git/rebase-apply/patch:97: space before tab in indent.

If I remember correctly I had to add the terminal commands for truecrypt additionally when I installed truecrypt the first time - before I found out that homebrew exists.  So my question is: How can use truecrypt which I installed via codebrew pull/code and how can I fix this issue?  Edit:     codeNewton:local hendrikwindel$ type truecrypt   truecrypt is aliased to '/Applications/TrueCrypt.app/Contents/MacOS/Truecrypt --text'/code   <answer126161> You pull is, which means the repo is copied to your computer but you need to execute :  precodebrew install truecrypt /code/pre  to really install it.  <comment147703> What does `type truecrypt` return?
