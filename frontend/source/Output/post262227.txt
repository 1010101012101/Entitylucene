How can I solve this problem???  <answer266259> You can try adjusting your iPhone clock to your current location.br Go to Settings  General  Date &amp; Time on iOS and set your time appropriately -either manually or automatically by switching the "Set Automatically" slider to on.  <comment328503> Sign out of AppStore. To do this, scroll all the way down in the AppStore on your phone and click the button with "Apple ID: your@login". In the popup window select 'Sign Out'. Restart your iPhone and sign back in. This shall help. <comment328506> Thank for you answer,I sign out  and try to sign in again.show the same message. <comment328507> You did restart your iPhone, didn't you? :) <comment328508> Yes ,I did.Do you know why will show this message？My device system version is iOS 9.0.2 and have JailBreaked. <comment328509> I do not have enough experience with jailbroken devices.
