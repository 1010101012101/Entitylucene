Custom Mac Keyboard Command <body> I wrote a script that opens an Xcode project of mine. I then went to Automator and created a Service. I set it to codeno input/code and codeAll Applications/code.  Saved it as "openX", then went to System Preferences and under keyboard - shortcuts I added a new shortcut for "openX" with kbd⌘/kbdkbdE/kbd.   When I kbd⌘/kbdkbdE/kbd in System Preferences it works and opens Xcode. But it doesn't work in any other application. I also tried to set codeFinder/code instead of codeAll Applications/code but that still doesn't work.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mYAmb.png" alt="Automator" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G5Whc.png" alt="System Pref"  <comment320712> The shortcut you added was explicitly under Shortcuts  Services and not under App Shortcuts, right? If not, at the bottom of the Services list you should find your openX service and can set the shortcut there. Setting it under App Shortcuts probably will not work. <comment320716> It's under Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services in the "General" section. I did find it and set it to cmd^e. It's still not working <comment320718> @Peter Please add a screenshot of the Automator action and your system version. <comment320720> When you're in the other applications, do you see the openX service in the menu? <comment321574> @klanomath just added a screenshot <comment321575> @Peter  The whole Automator action is appreciated - not just a small part of "Run shell script". You may obfuscate your name and the project name... <comment322451> @klanomath its just the path to my script
