Use Force Click to open link in a new tab in Safari? <body> I know it's possible to open a link a new tab by holding kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd when clicking a link. However, I think it would be great if I could simply use Force Touch for this - then my hands wouldn't have to leave the trackpad at all.  I have BetterTouchTool installed, but that program lacks a 'single-finger Force Click anywhere on the trackpad' trigger. Is there another workaround to achieve the desired effect, e.g. using AppleScript?  I'm on a 15" tMBP, should that be relevant.
