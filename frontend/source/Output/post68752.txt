Find iTunes songs with specific format (MPEG 1, Layer 2) <body> Recently I discovered that my iTunes Library contains songs with the MPEG-1, Layer 2 format.br It's impossible to sync them to my iPod. So I want to convert them to AAC or MP3.br But therefor I need a list of all songs that have that format.  Is there any way to get a list of all MPEG-1 Layer 2 formatted tracks in my iTunes library? To make things a little bit harder, they all have mp3 as extension.   <answer68755> You can make a smart playlist with;  Media Kind : is : Music  Kind : contains : MPEGimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wtzH8.png" alt="enter image description here"  I do not know if you can specify "MPEG-1 Layer 2", but it couldn't hurt to try.  <answer68802> If the files have mp3 as the extension, codemdfind kMDItemContentType==public.mp2/code or searching for codekind:mp2/code in Finder won't work either.  You could try using mplayer's command line utility. It can be installed with Homebrew or other package managers.  codeIFS=$'\n'; for f in $(find ~/Music -name *.mp3); do mplayer -identify -frames 0 "$f" 2&gt; /dev/null | grep -q 'layer-2 audio' &amp;&amp; echo mv "$f" ~/Desktop/; done/code  <comment79864> unfortunately `MPEG` matches mp3 too. And anything else (e.g. "Layer 2", "Layer" or just "2") does yield no results at all. <comment80016> totally awesome, worked like a charm. thank you.
