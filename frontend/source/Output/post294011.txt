OSX Sierra doc moves itself to another monitor <body> When running two external monitors in OS X Sierra, my dock sometimes changes which display it is located on.   Is there a setting to stop this from happening?  This happens at random times, and I can't reproduce the issue.  <comment371048> Brian, please be more specific. When does it switch screen? Is there any time in particular? Please give more details. <comment371049> It's totally random.  Happens to me every week or so. <comment371050> Do you unplug your external monitor a lot? <comment371051> Yes but mostly at the end of the work day.  Not the power cord, but the display adaptor (thunderbolt?) <comment371053> So the dock switches monitor about every week? <comment371055> Yes. Roughly once a week.  I unplug the monitors and it resets it, but I'd rather not have to do that.
