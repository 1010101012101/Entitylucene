Audio Codec Details for Directory <body> I have a directory full of different kind of music file (mp3,m4a,flac) in different bitrates and codecs.  I want to create an excel or similar structured file of all the files inside a particular directory with the columns being codec,bitrate,lossless/lossy,filesize.  Edit: I am using MediaInfo and I am able to extract the details one file at one time and take its output in a text file. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I5ied.png" alt="enter image description here"   So to Sum up: 1. How to run mediainfo for a directory ( looping around all files inside a directory) 2. Extracting only particular columns for each file 3. Writing in an excel with above extracted columns  Sorry If I am asking in the wrong place. I have MacOSx atm.  <comment315294> It's not clear what you are actually asking for. You want a spreadsheet... how far have you got in creating it & where did you get stuck? <comment315295> I used MediaInfo to extract details for one file, but I am unable to run it for multiple files using command line and writing the output to a file (lets say a text file at first attempt) <comment315296> Then could you edit your question & add sufficient detail for it to be answerable. <comment315297> @Tetsujin: Updated the question <comment315298> `mediainfo` doesn't seem to be part of a standard OSX installation, where can it be downloaded from? <comment315299> @patrix: https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo
