How to pick a color with DigitalColor Meter? <body> I want to pick a color from screen using the DigitalColor Meter. However, I cannot seem to lock the mouse. How am I supposed to use this tool?  <answer144530> Once the DigitalColor Meter is running, you can pick a color on the current mouse position by using the shortcut:  kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdC/kbd  It will store the value in the clipboard. The standard is RGB values e.g.     255 255 255  If you prefer hexadecimal notation, you can check this answer.  <comment170247> You mean locking position with `⌘`+`L` ?
