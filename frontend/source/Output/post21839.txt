Disable resume for all apps <body> I would like to disable resume for all applications  by default (including newly install applications).  I know the following command will disable resume for a specific application (Safari in this case)  codedefaults write com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false/code but I was wondering if there's a way to disable it permanently.  <answer21840> To disable resume for all applications permanently, in the Finder, press Shift-Command-G to "Go to the folder" ~/Library/Saved Application State/, then press Command-I to Get file info, and check the "locked" box to lock the folder. This will keep any newly installed applications from resuming.  <answer21841> Or use the Resuminator app:  http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/26/dear-aunt-tuaw-help-me-fine-tune-session-window-restores/  Allows both fine tuning or global toggle of Resume.  <answer21842> Uncheck codeRestore windows when quitting and re-opening apps/code under brcodeSystem Preferences -&gt; General/code.  In Mountain Lion, this option has been changed to read, codeClose windows when quitting an application/code with fine print to explain that open documents will not be restored.  <comment29554> This did not work for me. The application continue to resume, even when I uncheck it. <comment29569> @doc_180 The first time you open an app after unchecking that box, it will still restore windows on the next launch, but it shouldn't do so on subsequent launches. This is because the app's info is still in the "Saved Application State" folder when the setting is unchecked. The next time the app launches, that info will be removed.
