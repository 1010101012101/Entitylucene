Recover accidentally deleted photos not shown in recently deleted <body> I accidentally deleted a photo, and it does not show in the "recently deleted" folder. Is there any way I can get it back? I have iOS 8.2.   <answer202195> Unless you're strongemjailbroken/em/strong, there's no way to recover them if you don't have a backup.  <answer220491> Their is no way you can recover a photo after deleting it from recently deleted unless you have a backup  <comment230525> Do you have a backup? If yes, you find it and copy the photo from that backup. If you don't have a backup or if you weren't connected to your iTunes on a PC when deleting it, then it is probably gone <comment230540> Are you sure you got it deleted? I'm asking because you're saying "accidentally" so it looks like you're not sure what happened and you assumed you deleted it. As it's not in your "Recently deleted" folder, are you sure you didn't just hide it? <comment251146> Could you expand your answer to detail how a jailbreak helps here?
