Is it possible to resize video in iMovie? <body> I took a screen recording from my iPhone 5 and I want to convert its size from 640x1136 to 750x1134. For extra pixels I need black fill color. Is it possible in iMovie in OS X?  <answer210809> It's not possible to produce that exact resolution in iMovie 10, because it doesn't support custom resolutions. The only resolutions you can export a video project to are:  ul li480p: 854x480/li li540p: 960x540/li li720p: 1280x720/li li1080p: 1920x1080/li /ul  Note that all of these are 16:9 (1.778) whereas the target you're after is about 3:2 (1.66).  You can certainly add black borders or otherwise crop/frame videos in iMovie, so it emcould/em be a stepping stone to another tool. But It's probably not the tool you want if that precise output format is required.  Also remember that many video emplayers/em will automatically resize and add black borders on emplayback/em to best fit the screen's aspect ratio.
