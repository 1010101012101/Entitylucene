Crashed when creating a partition - now missing drive space! <body> Just a couple of hours ago, while I was taking a GNU course, I decided to create a partition on my SSD to have ubuntu installed, meanwhile the disk utility was doing that, suddenly it just crashed and restarted itself, leaving 5GB free from any partition, I used codediskutil list/code and this is the info it provided me:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            120.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +115.0 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  3B12580F-53CE-4FE2-A806-FB80AB07DD82                                  Unlocked Encrypted /code/pre  There is no additional partition on the disk utility and I was wondering if it is possible to recover this space.

But you probably resized the Logical Volume emMacintosh HD/em (disk1) residing in the Logical Volume Group emMacintosh HD/em (disk0s2).  To expand the Logical Volume emMacintosh HD/em to the full available size you have to use an undocumented command: codediskutil cs resizeVolume UUID size/code.  ol liBoot to your Recovery HD by pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while booting./li liOpen in the menubar Utilities-Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil cs list/code to get a list of all CoreStorage items./li liEnter codediskutil cs unlockVolume LVUUID/code (LVUUID is the UUID of the Logical Volume, usually it's the last UUID in the list you got earlier) to unlock the encrypted Logical Volume emMacintosh HD/em. You have to enter the FileVault passphrase now./li liEnter codediskutil cs resizeVolume LVUUID 0g/code (0g is a magical number here - it will expand the Logical Volume to the whole available size of the LVG)./li liEnter codeexit/code and quit Terminal/li liReboot to your main volume/li /ol  <comment264162> Hi, after repeated attempts to follow step by step each of the above steps, I get an operation error code 69674, it says that the size on my storage device is different and suggests a scan/repair immediately! <comment264164> @DavidM Then your LVG/LV got corrupted. Boot to the main volume and make a backup (e.g. with Time Machine) and then boot to your Recovery HD and try to repair it. <comment264827> So, thats more like a hard reset on my ssd? I'll make the backup and go through it, I really appreciate your time, TYVM <comment361077> Works, thank you!
