Are there any apps that can wirelessly copy to iOS? <body> I just tried out an app called AirMore to copy my music to my iPhone.  It looked awesome, until I realized that it was just putting the music in its own app, not in the iOS music app.  I see many more of these kinds of apps out there, and before I go checking them all, I thought I would ask to see if this is just something that Apple does not allow.  strongSo, does Apple allow this?  Are there any apps that do it?/strong  <comment347457> I found WALTR 2 to do this.  Not free, but it worked really well!  I would love to hear of a free option though.
