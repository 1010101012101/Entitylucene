What items should exist in a basic “Photos” app library’s file structure after an iPhoto import? <body> So I have been doing some cleanup of my Photos app library and noticed something odd… Odd at least to me. I am currently running version 2.0 (3150.4.120) under macOS Sierra (10.12.5).  Over the years I have been running different versions of iPhotos and when the Photos app came along, I imported my iPhoto library into it and all works good.  That said, when I looked into the actual contents of the “Photos Library” via “Show Package Contents” I saw what seemingly—and I assume are—crufty old files, directories and symlinks to items that seem to be remnants of the old iPhoto structure; screenshot below with blue highlighted items being what I assume is “cruft.”  My assumption of “cruft” were modification dates that date back to my initial import/migration from iPhotos as well as the fact many of these files seem empty. Especially the directories dated from 2000 to 2005. Nothing in them that seems to be significant.  That said I made a backup of the “Photos Library” and removed that cruft, crossed my fingers and everything launched fine.  So did I do the right thing to clean up this cruft? Does a basic “Photos Library” file simply contain the following parent directories:  ul licodeAttachments/code/li licodedatabase/code/li licodeMasters/code/li licodeprivate/code/li licoderesources/code/li /ul  Or did I “bork” something by doing this and haven’t tripped over it yet.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Htu3z.png" alt="Screenshot of my “Photos Library”"
