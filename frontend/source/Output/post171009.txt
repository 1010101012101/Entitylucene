What iphone app could snooze every 5 minutes? <body> I hope to find an iphone app that remind me to focus, snooze every 5 minutes, can be configured to play a ringtone or just vibrate. If the "5 minutes" is configurable, that's even better.  Unfortunately iPhone Clock alarm snoozes every 10 minutes. and "Nag" application snoozes every 1 minute :(  <answer171101> Have you tried strongDue/strong? It’s very configurable.  <comment201230> check this out https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easy-reminders-push-notifications/id382256515?mt=8 <comment201295> @Buscar웃 this does not snooze automatically every 5 minutes...
