Is there an equation in Numbers that will give me the sum of numbers based on a separate column? <body> I'm trying to find out if there is a way to create an equation that looks at one column, if it is equal to a certain value, then add the value in the other column?  Example:  precode#Table of running values:  Type     Cost ------------- A        $4 B        $2 B        $1 A        $6 /code/pre  I'd like to be able to create another table that results with this:  precode# Summation of each type  Type     Total -------------- A        $10 B        $3 /code/pre  Any help in setting up an equation to do this summation would be helpful.  <answer30324> I figured it out. The method is called code=SUMIF()/code. I am so happy. :)  <comment35296> Thanks. I just had to wait till enough time passed so I could.
