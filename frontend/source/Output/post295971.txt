How to run Hackintosh Sierra on USB? <body> h2Disclaimer/h2  I know running a Hackintosh isn't legal, I'm doing this for knowledge. As soon as I'll have the money I'd love to buy me a real MacBook, which is what I suggest you to do if you, like me, love Apple OSs.  hr  Hi there   I'm trying to install a copy of the Sierra Hackintosh not on a Hard Drive but on a USB drive.  h2Here's what I'm using:/h2  Laptop: Asus / Intel Core i5-3210M 2.5GHz / Nvidia GeForce 610M 2GB / RAM 12GB / SSD 500GB  USB: Kingstone HyperX Savage 64GB  h2What I did:/h2  I followed the guide to install it on a HDD and there a USB is used to install the OS on the HDD. That's why strongI'm using another USB to install the OS on my USB HyperX/strong.  To install it I plugged both the USBs on my laptop and then completed the installation process stronginstalling the OS on the HyperX/strong.  After that the laptop restarts, but strongif I boot the HyperX alone/strong it will tell me to strongreboot/strong using a proper boot option.  I checked using TransMac if the USB actually has the OS installed in, and strongit does/strong.  h2So here's the problem:/h2  Can I install the Sierra Hackintosh on my USB drive? How can I boot it correctly? What's stopping my USB to run with Sierra installed?  I'd like to be able to run Sierra by just plugging that HyperX onto any computer.
