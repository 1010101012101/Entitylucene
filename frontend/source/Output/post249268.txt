App Store won't update <body> I'm trying to update Airmail to the latest version on my MacBook with El-Capitan 10.11.6 (15G31).  When I go under App Store  Updates, I see no new updates. When I search for the Airmail app I see that I am 1 version behind. If I click the "update" button, all I see is the progress indicator spinning for hours.  I've tried:  ul liRestarting my Mac/li liClearing App Store cookies/li li"Reset Application" in App Store/li liRunning codekillall -KILL storeagent/code (which says codeNo matching processes belonging to you were found/code)/li liRunning Disk Utility to check for any problems (none found)/li /ul  How can I restore my ability to update apps?  <answer249465> Ultimately, I had to delete the Airmail app and reinstall it entirely. It's now able to update.  The problem appears to be due to the fact that when Airmail 2 was upgraded to Airmail 3, the internal app version was 3 while the version shown in the Applications folder was v2. I think this confused App Store.
