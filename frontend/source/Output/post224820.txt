iPhone asks for unknown Apple User ID <body> I was trying to update my mum's iPhone 6 last night and it wouldn't let me update the apps on her phone as it was asking for someone else's Apple ID.   She doesn't have any music, videos or books on her phone. All she does is syncing her photos to iCloud. She's never restored the phone, and bought it new straight from a major retailer.    I looked in settings and she's logged in as her profile in the App Store settings. I logged out and back in but it still prompts "enter the password for ziggytaylor@gmail.com, or something completely random like that.   Surely there isn't a bug/hack in iCloud which disables you from updating your phone?!  <comment272797> In short, the appleId that was used to download the app has to be the signed in AppleId for iTunes and App Store to update the app.  Apparently at some point in time that Appleid was logged in. You may have noted, different appleId can be used in various places in the setting. Before family sharing it was quite popular to use a common appleId for iTunes and App Store amongst friends and family. <comment273165> The Apple IDs which are appearing did not download the apps, and have never had anything to do with my mums phone. They belong to complete strangers, not family or friends, and certainly never downloaded or shared any content, whatsoever on her phone! That's why it seems like either a bug or a hack!  And it's not just one app, it's all of them that are blocked from updating!
