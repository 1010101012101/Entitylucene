UTF-8 glyphs are too small <body> I have been setting up my new terminal on both of my MacBooks Pro and I noticed that UTF-8 glyphs are way smaller on one of them. This holds true in every application and I can't find the setting that differs between the two laptops so I can get the big glyphs on both. Here are two pictures showing the difference: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RUBIO.png" alt="Big glyphs(how I would like them to be)" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NYyZM.png" alt="Small glyphs"  I thought it would be related to the codelocale/code variables but no: codeLANG="fr_FR.UTF-8"/code and codeLC_ALL="fr_FR.UTF-8"/code.  Any help is welcome!  PS: I work on Mac OS Sierra  <comment358588> The encoding should be irrelevant, it's the font that matters.  Same one on both machines? <comment358596> Font in the same in the example shown above but, as I said, it holds true for every application. Even in my web browser the alignment and size is not the same. (For instance http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2b22/index.htm) <comment358597> In Character Viewer, look in the Font Variation pane for 2b22 and see if there is a difference in size among the fonts that have it. <comment358602> It does, there are 2 different sizes possible! But I don't get why it would be rendered differently across my 2 laptops...
