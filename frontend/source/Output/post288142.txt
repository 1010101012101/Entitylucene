Is it possible to lock all notes, and automatically lock new notes, on Notes app? <body> I see that it's possible to password protect specific notes  I wonder if this can be done automatically to new notes so that I don't need to do it every time, if I want encrypted notes  Is it possible to lock all notes, and automatically lock new notes, on Notes app?  <answer288143> strongNo, you can't set all notes to be locked./strong But that doesn't mean they're not all encrypted.  If you scroll ALL the way down in Passcode settings (if you have a passcode), you'll see a little line of text that says codeData protection is enabled./code  That means everything on your device is encrypted with your passcode. That's why Apple can't unlock it for you - it's silently encrypted.  Therefore, all your notes (if you have a passcode) are already encrypted. Adding a lock is an extra layer, but you can't add a lock automatically.  If you'd like notes to automatically lock, feel free to send apple some feedback at strongapple.com/feedback/strong
