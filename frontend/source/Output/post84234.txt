Automator -> send file to email (from filename) <body> Im trying to create an Automator folder action that sends an email with an attached file.  In my folder the files will be generated with the email as name: Example: name@company.com.jpg, othername@othercompany.com.jpg and so on.  What I need is an action that copies the filename, remove the extension (.jpg), create an email and put the filename/email into the "To" and then sends the email.  I all ready have a working version where the file is attached to the e-mail and the content of the e-mail is filled out. But I can't find a solution to copy the file name and specify it to the "To" address.  Hope that someone out there can help me :-)  <answer84613> I've tried with Automator without succeeding looping through dropped files.  Here's a folder action script that does what you want, and how to attach it to a folder :  strong1. Open AppleScript Editor/strong  strong2. Paste the following script into a new document/strong  precodeproperty mail_subject : "An image for you" property mail_plain_content : "Attached you will the image you required." &amp; return &amp; return &amp; "Best Regards" &amp; return &amp; "Automator" property mail_html_content : "Attached you will the image you required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best Regards&lt;br&gt;Automator"  on adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items     processItems(these_items) end adding folder items to  on processItems(these_items)     repeat with i from 1 to (count of these_items)         set this_item to item i of these_items         if isFolder(this_item) then             processItems(getFolderItems(this_item))         else             processFile(this_item)         end if     end repeat end processItems  on processFile(this_file)     set mail_address to RemoveExtension(getFileName(this_file))     tell application "Microsoft Outlook"         set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:mail_subject, plain text content:mail_plain_content, content:mail_html_content}         tell newMessage             make new recipient with properties {email address:{address:mail_address}}             make new attachment with properties {file:this_file as alias}             send         end tell         activate     end tell end processFile  on isFolder(this_item)     tell application "System Events" to return (exists folder (this_item as string)) end isFolder  on RemoveExtension(this_name)     -- This function comes from :     -- http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/sbrt/index.html     if this_name contains "." then         set this_name to (the reverse of every character of this_name) as string         set dot_offset to the offset of "." in this_name         set this_name to (text (dot_offset + 1) thru -1 of this_name)         set this_name to (the reverse of every character of this_name) as string     end if     return this_name end RemoveExtension  on getExtension(this_name)     if this_name contains "." then         set this_name to (the reverse of every character of this_name) as string         set dot_offset to the offset of "." in this_name         set this_name to (text 1 thru (dot_offset - 1) of this_name)         set this_name to (the reverse of every character of this_name) as string         return this_name     else         return ""     end if end getExtension  on getFileName(this_file)     tell application "Finder" to return name of this_file end getFileName  on getFolderItems(this_folder)     tell application "Finder" to return items of this_folder end getFolderItems /code/pre  strong3. Save it in your em~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/em Folder/strong  Menu strongFile/strong  strongSave/strong   Go to the right folder : press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdG/kbd and paste:br strongem~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/em/strongbr and click strongGo/strong  Save as : strongImage - Email using name as address.scpt/strong em(for example)/embr Format : strongScript/strong   strong4.

This is exactly what I'm looking for. And look at that description... Excellent! You're to cool Bibou ;-) <comment98144> Would it be possible to make a "Send active email" command to Outlook, so that the e-mails are send in the same action. Otherwise I have to press "send" manually on all the e-mails :-) <comment98212> Replacing the "open" command by "send" in the on processFile / tell new Message part should do the trick. I've edited my answer accordingly. <comment98275> Thank you so much for your help. It's really appreciated :-)
