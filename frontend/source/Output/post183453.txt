Is it safe to convert Core Storage partition to HFS+? <body> I just got my new Macbook Pro, I tried to make two new partitions using Disk Utility but I could only create one. After googling I found out that I can't create more than one additional partition in the CoreStorage and I need to revert it back to HFS+ in order to do that.  So, is it safe to Convert from CoreStorage to HFS+? What is the advantages/disadvantages of CoreStorage over HFS+?  And in case I converted CoreStorage to HFS+, can I convert back to CoreStorage if I needed to?
