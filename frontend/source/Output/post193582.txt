Two phone numbers on FaceTime <body> We have 2 iPads, 2 iPhones and 1 Apple ID. How can I add the 2nd iPhone number? Would like to have emmy/em iPad FaceTime &amp; messages associated with emmy/em iPhone; my husband's iPad FaceTime &amp; messages associated with his iPad.  <answer193584> 1 Apple ID is the problem.   You'd need to remove the ID as a contact source &amp; just use the phone numbers.br Settings  Facetime   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8nLIT.png" alt="enter image description here"  sub Same settings for iPad, just laid out slightly differently/sub  <comment230754> How many AppleID's are you using?
