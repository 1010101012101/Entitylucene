It looks more like network setup question. You need to check your router settings. Looks like you have either wrong or missing DNS addresses. If you don't know what it is, call tech support of your internet provider.  <comment192290> Can you visist other websites? You could try unplugging your router, wait 10 seconds and plug it back in
