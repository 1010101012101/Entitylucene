I am trying to Time Machine backup ALL my iMac data, across all users, is this possible without running into permissions issues? <body> I currently have 3 user accounts in my iMac. One of them I use for work, the other for personal and finally one for my kids. The admin account is under the one for work. I have been backing up the entire iMac computer using Time Machine.   To my chilling surprise today, I went into my Time Machine backups and noticed that the folders under my personal and kids accounts were locked with a small red minus sign circle in the bottom right hand side of the folder. It claimed that I did not have permission to open it. I tried to go to Info and then Sharing and Permissions but am not able to change the privileges.   Is there anyway I can access those files? Why does it not allow me to go into the other accounts? As a separate but related question, if I were to restore a Time Machine backup with all three accounts onto a brand new computer, would the personal and kids accounts be still there?  <comment373839> Check the original user folders (personal/kids) on your iMac and you will have the same restrictions (aka account separation). That's the default in macOS/OS X. Still all files are backed up! <comment373849> @klanomath Thanks! I went into my time machine backup folder in my external hard drive and found the personal/kids folders, then used `chmod 755 /Users/Personal` on the terminal command line and the same for kids. Would changing the permissions for other users in a time machine backup make it unusable? If I were to restore a computer back one day using the backup would it give me any hard problems? <comment373851> You shouldn't change ANYTHING manually in the backupdb folder! I asked you to open the Personal folder on your iMac and compare it with the permissions of the same folder in Time Machine. They should be the same: i.e. If you can't access /Users/Personal/Music as admin user on your iMac, you won't be able to access the same folder in the Time Machine backup. The content of /Users/Personal/Music is still backed up even if you can't access it as admin. That's the purpose of a full backup. The permissions of the source are kept in the backup. <comment373855> Thanks, do you forsee any problems with manually doing things in the backupdb folder?
