How to create an up to date ML recovery? <body> There were several updates affecting the recovery partition. Is there a way to create an usb memory stick containing an up to date Mountain Lion recovery partition?  <answer77649> Yes,   Download Mountain Lion again from the App Store and create a bootable USB from the new downloaded files.  Either by using Disk Utility or by using Lion Disk Maker.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cSxIK.png" alt="enter image description here"     strongFull tutorial/strong can be found on Arstechnica website   <comment89973> You could also use [SuperDuper](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) to have a bootable back-up. I know this isn't the question but it helped me massively. <comment90012> This is not exactly what I wanted, but good enough. I'd like to have just a recovery partition not the entire installation. <comment90024> I just figured out how to do that. If you mount InstallESD.dmg you find a hidden BaseSystem.dmg which contains a recovery partition. You might want to burn this to a CD and boot from that.
