How to open or convert old .efx (eFax) documents without PowerPC support? <body> I have a number of very old code.efx/code documents (from 2004) that were sent to me from the eFax service.  They are no longer available on eFax's website (so I can't just get them from there and change the format). (I changed eFax's setting a long time ago to send me new faxes in PDF format, so this problem only applies to my very old faxes.)  The most recent version of eFax Messenger is a PowerPC app so it can't be opened on recent versions of Mac OS X.  The simplest way seems to be just downloading eFax Messenger on a computer with Windows, but since I don't have access to one that's not an option.  So does anyone know of an all-Mac way to open these files?  Or a way to convert them into a file format that I can open, e.g., PDF or TIFF?  <answer112862> Since you updated your settings to receive faxes now in PDF, you can:   ul liFax the EFX documents to your assigned eFaxÂ® number (via website or e-mail). /li liThe new files should be received as PDF./li /ul  If you need further assistance, please let us know and we can convert them to PDF for you.
