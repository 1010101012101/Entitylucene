How do you change the format of the OSX Screen Shot file name? <body> I'd like my screen shots to only be named with the current date time, preferably in a format like:  precode2016-09-02-16:02:48 /code/pre  How should I go about doing this?  So far I've tried inserting an empty string into codecom.apple.screencapture name/code  as shown:  precode$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture name "" $ killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  But OSX is still inserting a space as shown below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EUipw.png" alt="enter image description here"  So there's two problems I'm having:  ol liHow do I change the date time format so there are no spaces?/li liHow do I make sure there is no leading space in the screenshot filename?/li /ol  Thanks :)  <answer251393> You neither can rename a file to the proposed name - it contains several colons (code:/code) which are reserved (= forbidden) characters in the HFS+ file system - nor does codedefaults write com.apple.screencapture .../code allow a different date format.  One idea though is creating a launch agent to rename all files in a dedicated folder starting with "Screen Shot ...":  A very simple solution, assuming you restore the default naming convention for screenshots and replace emuser_name/em by your short name below, is then:  Create a file named "screencaprn" in e.g /usr/local/bin with the content:  precode#!/bin/bash  mv /Users/user_name/Desktop/Screen\ Shot*.png /Users/user_name/Desktop/"`date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H.%M.%S"`.png"; $2&gt;/dev/null /code/pre  Change permissions:  precodechmod +x /usr/local/bin/screencaprn /code/pre  Then create a launch agent in ~/Library/LaunchAgents with the name "usr.screenshot.rename.plist"  and the content:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;usr.screenshot.rename&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/screencaprn&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/user_name/Desktop&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Then load the plist with:  precodelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/usr.screenshot.rename.plist /code/pre  This works but has a delay of up to 10 seconds (thus changes the seconds and sometimes the minutes of the original named screenshot file e.g. emScreen Shot 2016-09-03 at 03.24.strong02/strong.png/em to em2016-09-03-03.24.strong05/strong.png/em) and adds one emcom.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (usr.screenshot.rename): Service only ran for X seconds. Pushing respawn out by Y seconds./em line to the system log.  <answer251403> See How do I change the default screenshot name in OS X Lion? for changing the rest of the name. The space is inserted by the string format indicated in the strings file, most likely due to the need for localization of date and time values. If you combine changing the plist name prefix with changing the formatted tinestamp you can make it do whatever you like.   <comment312507> Note on the `:` character: Actually it is not a reserved or special character on the HFS+ filesystem, and you can use it perfectly well in a filename. However it will look like a `/` in Finder due to a throwback from conversion from Classic Mac OS (which allowed the `/` character in filenames, but not `:`) to OS X (which does not allow `/`, but does allow `:`).
