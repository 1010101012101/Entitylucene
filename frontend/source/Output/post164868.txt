How can I erase my Macintosh HD? <body> I have already booted up my pc pressing Cmd+R and tried to erase the Macintosh HD partition, but I still can't do it  <answer164873> Go to your Disk Utility [it's in Applications  Utilities  Disk Utility] or by Spotlight Search.   Click on the Volume where your Mac HD is on. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FEDjC.png" alt="image1"  Click on Partition tab and select the corresponding partition you want to erase. Now click on the minus (-) button in the bottom bar. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NucH4.png" alt="image2"  Note this option will be grayed out if you don't have more than 1 partition. Instead you want to erase the drive. Click on the Erase tab of Macintosh HD and erase accordingly.  <comment193343> what PC do you have ? and what does it say that you can not do? <comment193348> Thank you for trying to help, but I kinda figured it out on my own. I had to click on the Macintosh HD tab and mount the disk, then I could erase it normally. I don't know why that happened btw
