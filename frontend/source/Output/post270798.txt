rEFInd delete itself after restart on Sierra <body> I followed the instruction here The rEFInd Boot Manager: Installing rEFInd.  ol licodemkdir /Volumes/ESP/code/li licodemount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/ESP//code/li licodebless --mount /Volumes/ESP/ --setBoot --file /Volumes/ESP/EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi --shortfor/code/li /ol  I have also disabled codeSIP/code and it still won't work, and after restarting the system the code/Volumes/ESP/code folder is gone. I have found an empty codeEFI/code folder in code/Volumes/code and I tried to use it and mount codedisk0s1/code to it but still the same issue that is everything is removed after restart!   <comment340425> Did you copy anything to /Volumes/ESP/EFI/refind after creating the folder /Volumes/ESP/EFI/refind?
