No animation with MissionControl? Why? <body> I don't have animation for Mission Control anymore. It seems that it has been like that for few days. I have updated Duet a few days ago, maybe that's related...  What happened? Is it possible that someone disable it? Or, is it a bug or the sign that the hardware is damaged?  OS: 10.11.5 Hardware: MacBook Pro (2,3 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 Go, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 Mo)  hr  h1Edit/h1  I've tried to do in the terminal  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.25 /code/pre  then press enter  precodekillall Dock /code/pre  then press enter  It works. But when I restart the computer, it does not work anymore.  hr  I've tried installing codeDuet/code (third party software which I suspected to be responsible). It did not change anything.  h1Edit 2/h1  I've tried stronguninstalling/strong codeDuet/code (third party software which I suspected to be responsible). It did not change anything.  <answer245391> If the Terminal commands mentioned above give you the animation back, you could try putting them in a script file and having it run as a login item.  First, open Script Editor. Hit ⌘N to make a new document window, and in that window paste the following AppleScript script:  precodedo shell script ¬ "defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.00" &amp; ¬ "defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.25" ¬ &amp; return &amp; ¬ "killall Dock" /code/pre  Next, click File  Export. At the bottom of the save dialogue, choose Application as the file type. It doesn't really matter where you save it to, as long as you will know where it is later.  Next, go to System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups. Click on your user account, and go to the Login Items tab. Click the plus button at the bottom of the list, navigate to your new application and click the emAdd/em button. Now, whenever you log out and back in or restart your computer, this script will be run, (hopefully) fixing your Mission Control animations.  As to exactly strongwhy/strong this might be happening, I honestly have no clue. Never had this issue before.  <answer245427> I too, have Duet installed and lost Mission Control animations on last update.  I believe it's some lazy "bug fixing" on Duet's team: Duet was running and I got logged out of my Mac  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration /code/pre  then run Duet and then  precodedefaults read com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration /code/pre  It's again gets set to zero.  So my solution so far is deleting codeexpose-animation-duration/code setting and removing Duet from autostart for a time being.  <answer245794> You can try making the commands that made it work run at startup. So just open TextEdit, type  precode#!/bin/bash defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.25 killall Dock /code/pre  Then save it as whatever (just make sure it either has no extension or that the extension is code.sh/code or code.command/code), open System Preferences, go to Users &amp; Groups  Login Items, and add it to there.  <answer245992> Remove Duet from your login items, then type codedefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.25;killall Dock/code.  It is a bug in Duet. Do not use it for a while.  <answer246747> Try resetting your dock back to it's original configuration. This will involve deleting the codecom.apple.dock.plist/code file so that when the Dock is reloaded it will create a new dock as if this is the first time you are logging in.  This means you will have to redo all your customizations  Go to code~/Library/Preferences/code and execute the command:  precodemv com.apple.dock.plist ~/.Trash; killall Dock /code/pre  That will bring your Dock back to the state when you first created your account so you will have to re-customize. I opted to move the files to trash, so that if you want to go back, you can restore from Trash and everything will be the way it was before you started.  However, if you just want to delete the file permanently, you could also issue the command (there's no going back with this one):  precoderm com.apple.dock.plist; killall Dock /code/pre  Reboot, and all should be working again.  <comment301763> You could try to make a new user and see if it's happening there. If it's not happening there, then it could be that a third party application is resetting the animation speed or causing some sort of error. <comment301766> This problem does not occur for other users on my computer, you were right. <comment301854> I'm actually kind of out ideas. I can't remember if it's normally animated in the safe mode. That is something you could try. You could then try to open suspected apps to try and figure out which application is causing it... Maybe. <comment301914> The animations are already disabled when I restart (or turn on) the computer. <comment303293> Try resetting your dock back to it's original configuration.  Go to `~/Library/Preferences` and `mv com.apple.dock.plist ~/.Trash; killall Dock`  That will bring your Dock back to the state when you first created your account so you will have to re-customize.  If it doesn't work, you can "undelete" from the Trash <comment304050> @Allan it works. Now, let us see if it will work after the next start up... <comment304397> @Allan it works. You can make your comment an answer if you want. <comment304401> thanks.  Just posted my answer.  Glad I could help.
