I dismissed "For You" in iTunes 12.2 for Mac, How do I get it back? <body> h1Context/h1  OS X 10.10.4 (14E46)br iTunes 12.2.0.145  h1Question/h1  strongI just installed iTunes 12.2 for OS X, the first version of iTunes with new Apple Music features./strong   After installing (which went perfectly smoothly AFAICT), I launched the new iTunes (with the new white icon). There was a new tab in the top center called codeFor You/code. I clicked on this tab, and was shown a screen with a lot of exciting codeFor You/code content. Then I clicked a text link on this page that said codeGo to My Music/code.  I was taken back to the codeMy Music/code tab, and the codeFor You/code tab disappeared entirely. I didn't expect that codeFor You/code would completely disappear if I clicked that text link. I'd like to get the codeFor You/code tab back.  I've searched thru the iTunes main menu, and thru the iTunes (modal) Preferences window, and thru my iTunes Account Info page in vain. I cannot find any way to reinstate the codeFor You/code tab. How can I get the codeFor You/code tab back?  <answer193848> ul liIn the strongView/strong menu, select Music (⌘1) /li liIf you don't see words like "My Music, Playlists, strongFor You/strong, New, Radio, Connect..." then continue./li liIn the strongAccount/strong menu, select Sign Out/li liThen sign back in and repeat the first step ⌘1/li /ul  hr  The For You tab is generated by Apple's servers, so any busy-ness there or overload can cause it to be blank. You might also need to go through the steps to identify which genres and then artists you like and which ones you love a second time if your initial elections didn't get saved properly to the cloud.  Worst case - check Apple's System Status page - http://apple.com/support/systemstatus and consider reaching out to Apple Support if your account doesn't clear itself out over an 8 hour period or more.  <answer193965> OP Here. I found two ways to reinstate the codeFor You/code tab.  ol liThere is also a setting for this in the iTunes Preferences Window after all:  codePreferences &gt; General &gt; Show Apple Music/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EXZPV.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liAlternatively, in the main menu, click codeAccount &gt; Apple Music…/code. This will make the codeFor You/code tab and another codeNew/code tab return. Although the content under the codeFor You/code tab is now gone, and in its place there's just a button for trying Apple Music and another for codeGo to my Music/code./li /ol  <comment231129> Yep, thanks. Merely clicking this menu item (`Main Menu  Account  Apple Music…`) made the `For You` tab and another `New` tab return. Although the content under the `For You` tab is now gone, and in its place there's just a button for trying Apple Music and another for `Go to my Music`. <comment231230> I had to sign out first to get the menu item to appear.
