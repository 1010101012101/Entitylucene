How to specify non-breaking space on Mac Excel - Mac version of char(160) <body> On Windows, you can specify non-breaking spaces in Excel formulas with codechar(160)/code, for example:  precode=A1&amp;char(160)&amp;A2 =substitue(cell_ref,char(160),"") /code/pre  On Excel for Mac (2011), however, codechar(160)/code maps not to the non-breaking space character, but to the "dagger" character, † (code†/code).  strongWhat's a Mac-friendly way to specify non-breaking space?/strong (this is probably very easy for anyone who knows what encoding Mac Excel uses and how to look up character codes)  I can strongeminput/em/strong a non-breaking space with codeopt-space/code, and Excel (so far) seems to treat it as a non-breaking space, but it's not great for readability - in a formula, it looks just like any space.  hr  emBonus points for any answer that works consistently between Windows and Mac versions of excel - but for this question, Mac-only is enough/em  <answer188733> This appears to be a problem with UTF-8 encoding in Excel 2011.

That seems to be the code in Excel Mac  The reason is that your Excel Mac is working in the old MacRoman character set, where 160 is a dagger (U+2020) and 202 is a no break space (U+00A0)  http://www.alanwood.net/demos/macroman.html  <comment212359> yup, Mac nbsp is opt/space <comment237769> Any details as to why?
