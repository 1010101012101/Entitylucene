Remap Left Spacebar key on MS Sculpt ergonomic keyboard <body> I'm using the Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard with my Macbook Retina, on Yosemite. This ergonomic keyboard has a split Spacebar key, like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qCpdZm.jpg" alt="Split Spacebar on the MS Sculpt keyboard"  I want to remap the left Spacebar key to Backspace to simplify my typing. On Windows, a custom driver enables this remapping out of the box. However, this driver is not available on OS X.  I've already installed Karabiner and experimented with remapping keys. When I start up the EventViewer in Karabiner, both keys show up as codeKeyCode::SPACE/code. Is there a lower-level keycode I can access to differentiate between the left and right Spacebar keys?  Any alternate solutions are also welcome!  <answer225984> The best thing I've come up with so far is to use Right-Alt as backspace. Not quite as good, but it gets the job done.  <answer265001> Found this answer:      By default, the functions of both the left spacebar and the right   spacebar is to enter a space.  If you want the customized function of   the split space bar (where the left button acts as a backspace key and   the right button acts as a space-bar key), to get activated, you need   to strongpress and hold left and right space bar at the same time for more   than 3 seconds/strong.   Seems like this is an keyboard function itself, not OS.  <comment332227> Can you share a source? I just tried this, didn't work for me. I might be doing something wrong.
