OS X: View Zip File as Folder <body> One of the few good features of Windows is its ability to view a zip file as a folder. Is there some way, possibly using a third party app, to do the same on the Mac?  I know there are a number of apps which will mount the zip file as a volume, but I haven’t found a way to see one simply as a folder.  <answer231748> Zipster does exactly that.    emblurb straight from their site/em     What is Zipster?        Ever been envious of the way Windows users can just   browse into Zip files, copy files in and out of them with ease and all   without running a Zip utility? With Zipster, your Zip files are just   like another folder in Finder. Plus, unlike on Windows, you can open   files and save into them from any application.      Zipster is      ul   liFree./li   liFast. Writes and compression are done in the background so you can get on with your work. And we’ve done a bit of work to make reading   snappy too./li   liFriendly. No more pesky .DS_Store files — and your friends on other platforms won’t be complaining any more./li   liUseful. In addition to plain Zip files, Zipster works with JAR, WAR, ipa and apk files./li   /ul   It does have slight limitations when it comes to trying to put things away; it reacts a bit like a mounted .dmg except it's right where the file was, not on the desktop, but it's not a bad attempt at transforming .zips into folders.  <answer232286> I wrote about how to install Zipster here: http://www.mackungfu.org/work-with-zips-as-folders-like-with-windows  Unfortunately I can't add this as a comment to the relevant thread because I lack the experience points.   <answer272786> Nice suggestion but not a complete solution: Zipster (v1.0.4, apparently from 3/2/15 per the file times) doesn't support encrypted files at this time.  I know because I tried it. :-(  OTOH there is now a Mac version of WinZip.  I haven't tried it.  Costs $30.  <comment283042> Good one. Installing it is slightly problematic (I had to install the free license key manually), but otherwise it works like a charm. Thanks <comment283043> At least it's free these days - I'm sure I had to pay for it when it first came out ;) <comment283780> It should not be a comment as comments could be deleted but the infoprmation could be an edit to other answers if there is an issue with installing <comment345495> Unfortunately [Zipster can cause your Mac to crash](https://twitter.com/CoriolisSystems/status/836232163733430273), so it cannot be recommended. <comment345497> A lot of the Coriolis stuff isn't what it used to be, unfortunately. I gave up with Zipster & iPartition a while ago.
