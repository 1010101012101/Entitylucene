What is the best icon creator for mac? <body> I'm new to mac, I used to use Axialis IconWorkshop on Windows. So I want to know what's the best icon creator for mac?  <answer3121> If you have access to Photoshop, then I highly recommend Iconbuilder from Iconfactory. Back when I doing this, Iconbuilder made the creation of resources for a variety of platforms a snap.  <answer3129> If you want free software your best choice was Pic2Icon and you can also try img2icnsapp free version and if you like it, can upgrade it to pro version.  and the best software was iconeer but it's not free and you must pay for it.  I also suggest you see this page for more infos.  <answer16465> If you just have a codetiff/code file that you need to make into an icon, you can use the built-in command line program codetiff2icns/code.  (This is probably not the best all-around answer, but it has been useful to me.)  <answer89747> It's been years and things are changing, let me answer my own question, What is the best icon creator for Mac?  I think the answer is codeiconutil/code for me. You can get more info by running codeman iconutil/code in Terminal.  I also create an Automator workflow:  https://github.com/sparanoid/automator-workflows#create-app-iconset  You can convert a set of images or a single image to an icon.  <answer95034> Since it isn't mentioned, I'll do it: IconSlate is a fantastic app for creating both Windows (code.ico/code) and Mac (code.icns/code) icons. Simple to use, beautifully designed and does exactly what it says on the tin. Highly recommended!  <comment2782> I tried all these apps and Iconbuilder and found img2icns just fit my need and work fine for me. however Iconbuilder is great too but it's a little expensive. <comment104128> Iconbuilder is not working with PS CS 6 <comment104130> The iconeer page is offline. <comment243148> Hire [Susan Kare](http://www.kare.com) - she's the best icon creator for Mac.
