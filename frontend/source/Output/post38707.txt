How to disable animations on iPhone? <body> iPhone has many miscellaneous  animations. For example, there is a “emmaximize window/em” animation whenever we open an app, and a “emminimise window/em” animation whenever we close an app.  On Android, we can opt to disable animations via emSettings/em → emDisplay/em → emAnimations/em → emNo animations/em.  How do we turn off animations on iPhone?  <answer38711> The only way I'm aware of to do this is to use a jailbreak tweak called Springtomize. Apple will not allow you to do this natively since it affects the aesthetic quality of the device. That's just Apple!  <answer118288> Since iOS7 there are a couple of options for reducing animations and other UI effects such as translucency:  codeSettings &gt; General &lt; Accessibility &gt; Increase Contrast: On/Off/code and  codeSettings &gt; General &lt; Accessibility &gt; Reduce Motion: On/Off/code  <answer218663> I also had the same problem on my iPhone 5s.  When I checked my Reduce Motion setting, it was disabled. Which means there must be motion.  So I powered off my iPhone and powered on it again. After that everything was back to normal.
