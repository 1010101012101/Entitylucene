If you have more specific needs, Handbrake is the video converter of choise on OSX.  For other files, applications like GoodReader or Air Sharing (link to iPhone version, there is also an universal version available) allow reading most "standard" document formats and also offer ways to upload files to your phone without using iTunes.  <comment40056> You are looking for conversion software running *on the iPhone* itself?
