How do you install Emacs on OS X from the console? <body> I'm new to OS X and need to install Emacs 24.5 and 25.1 using the console to test a package using Travis continuous integration (http://travis-ci.org). My .travis.yml file looks like this (also testing with Linux) -   precodelanguage: generic  # test on linux and osx (windows not available on travis ci yet) # this os key also multiplies the build matrix (set below) os:     - linux     - osx  # build matrix - test on different emacs versions env:   matrix:     - EMACS=emacs24     - EMACS=emacs25  install:     - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME-$EMACS" == "linux-emacs24" ]]; then         sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:cassou/emacs &amp;&amp;         sudo apt-get update -qq &amp;&amp;         sudo apt-get install -qq emacs24 emacs24-el;       fi     - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME-$EMACS" == "linux-emacs25" ]]; then         sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-elisp/ppa &amp;&amp;         sudo apt-get update -qq &amp;&amp;         sudo apt-get -qq -f install &amp;&amp;         sudo apt-get install -qq emacs-snapshot;       fi     - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME-$EMACS" == "osx-emacs24" ]]; then           # install with homebrew - builds from source, took ~15mins           # brew install emacs ;           # even using the .dmg files takes ~6mins each           wget https://emacsformacosx.com/emacs-builds/Emacs-24.5-universal.dmg &amp;&amp;           hdiutil attach Emacs-24.5-universal.dmg &amp;&amp;           sudo ln -s /Volumes/Emacs/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs /usr/local/bin/emacs;       fi     - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME-$EMACS" == "osx-emacs25" ]]; then           wget https://emacsformacosx.com/emacs-builds/Emacs-25.1-universal.dmg &amp;&amp;           hdiutil attach Emacs-25.1-universal.dmg &amp;&amp;           sudo ln -s /Volumes/Emacs/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs /usr/local/bin/emacs;       fi  script:   make test /code/pre  I initially got a syntax error with travis lint (http://lint.travis-ci.org/) - "syntax error: (): did not find expected '-' indicator while parsing a block collection at line 30 column 3", which is pointing at the first if statement - that error turned out actually to be due to having comments inside the third if statement, so I moved them elsewhere.   So then I was able to install Emacs 25 with brew, as that is the current version it will build - but how would you install Emacs 24.5 with brew?   And is there a better way to install binaries on OS X than the .dmg files? They were faster than brew (6 minutes vs 15 minutes), but not as fast as apt install on Linux (~1 minute).  Thanks in advance for any pointers!
