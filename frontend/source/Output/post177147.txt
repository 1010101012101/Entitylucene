Disable Trackpad and Keyboard Temporarily <body> Is it possible to disable the trackpad and mouse temporarily while you have an external mouse and keyboard plugged in.  The keys keep getting accidentally hit while I have the mouse and keyboard plugged in.  brbrbrbr strongEdit/strong  Thank you to everyone who answered, because of this I was able to make an applescript to toggle the builtin keyboard on and off:  precodetry     if (display dialog "Press OK to Enable Keyboard and cancel to disable.") = {button returned:"OK"} then         do shell script "sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/" with administrator privileges     end if on error msg     do shell script "sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/" with administrator privileges end try /code/pre  <answer177148> Cannot find out how to do disable the keyboard but to disable the trackpad do this (for Yosemite)  Go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Mouse &amp; Trackpad/code and check codeIgnore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present/code  Got this from here.  If you don't want to use the keyboard don't touch it! Will look this up if you still want to know.  <answer177150> For the trackpad, there’s a setting for this on 10.7 and later.   System Preferences  Accessibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  “Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present”  As for the keyboard: I haven’t tested this solution for disabling the built-in keyboard and wouldn’t recommend doing it either. Apparently you can unload a kernel extension to disable it completely.  <answer177151> Before doing this.....

It worked for me to prevent my Cat taking over.  <comment209405> Thank you for the response I believe the keyboard response is slightly more valuable at this time <comment209406> I also saw that and didn't suggest it because of it could cause issues. <comment209408> Thats ok. How do you accidentally press a key on the keyboard? <comment347307> my cat sometimes presses the buttons
