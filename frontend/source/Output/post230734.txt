Shortcut for [return] key <body> How do I make a keyboard shortcut for the codereturn/code key? For example, if I pressed code~/code it would press codereturn/code for me. I'd like to do this without applescript. Is this possible, or will I have to buy a functioning external keyboard because my return key doesn't work!  <answer230736> Download, install and start Karabiner. In the menubar open (Karabiner icon)- Preferences. Enter "Return" in the search field and choose one of the preconfigured key codes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWu0W.png" alt="Karabiner"  By editing the emprivate.xml/em in emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em  you may add any additional  key or (not already used) key combination and choose this one instead.  <answer237058> You can do this without being admin on your Mac, and with a simple creation of a key binding file.  Create a file (on a standard install, the directory codeKeyBindings/code doesn't exist):  precodemkdir ~/Library/KeyBindings /code/pre  containing the following remapping:  precode$ cat &gt;~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict &lt;&lt;end_of_file /* my keybindings */ {         "\U007e" = ("insertNewline:") ; } end_of_file /code/pre  code\U007e/code means Unicode of the standard code~/code character (== code0x7e/code). You can't use code"~"/code in this dictionary because it means kbdoption/kbd.  (I suggest to avoid the use of the character code~/code because it is used in command environnment to mean code${HOME}/code. For example if you want to use kbdoption/kbd+kbd//kbd, put code"~/"/code in place of code"\U007e"/code.)  And restart your session.  To suppress this key binding, just remove this file:  precoderm ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict /code/pre  and if you dont need it, remove also the useless directory:  precodermdir ~/Library/KeyBindings /code/pre  and restart your session.  <comment281743> Karabiner can't download without an admin username and password. Is there any way to just get the app, and not the DMG? <comment281746> @ALX You can't download it or you can't install it? <comment281750> No, I'd need the ZIP, not the DMG to open it... forgot my admin password and don't want to go through the steps to retrieve or reset it. <comment281754> @ALX The admin password is obligatory because AFAIR you have to install a launch daemon and a launch agent. <comment281755> Darn... Well, I guess I'll have to go back and retrieve my password <comment290227> While there is an accepted answer below and this question was a pretty good academic exercise, I have to put on my "operations hat" on for a sec and say that in the name of productivity, you should get a new keyboard.  This is like trying to go from Miami to New York by way of Alaska.
