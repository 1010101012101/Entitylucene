Only a small subset of contacts is synced in iOS 9 <body> Thanks to the help I got here, my iOS 9 contacts are synced with my GMail account pretty well - the sync works, but is not immediate.  I would like to sync my contacts to iCloud as well, in order to be able to call a contact from FaceTime on my Macbook Pro with El Capitan 10.11.1.  I have enabled contact sync under iCloud on my device:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pG4Jw.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, only 44 contacts are synced. There seems to be nothing special about them - some are old, some are new, and they were all synced from GMail.  Any idea how to sync these contacts to iCloud?  <comment256932> can you see your entire contact list on icloud.com - contacts. <comment256933> @maetsoh Done that, I see only 44 contacts out of the hundreds I have in my phone. <comment256935> Have you tried deleting your iCloud account (from settings - mail,contacts,calendar), restarting the phone and adding the iCloud again. This will force the data that is not already synced to sync. <comment256937> @maetsoh Do you mean `settings` - `iCloud`, and unchecking / checking contacts, mail etc? Will that *delete* the iCloud account? <comment256938> No, you should have a copy of your iCloud account in Settings -   Mail, Contacts, Calendar. This is the account you'll have to delete (delete button in the bottom of the screen) <comment256943> Go to :  1 http://i.stack.imgur.com/edmyE.jpg 2 http://i.stack.imgur.com/D1Lz3.jpg 3 http://i.stack.imgur.com/5r6hQ.jpg  and from the same screen as 2 (ie Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars) click add an account and add the iCloud account you just deleted. this should work fine <comment257097> @maetsoh Thanks, didn't work for me - same 44 contacts synced.
