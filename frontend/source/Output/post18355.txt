How can I force Finder.app to use NTLMv2 when connecting to Windows file shares? <body> I need to allow Mac users to connect to Samba/CIFS shares that are forcing NTLMv2 (or higher), but unfortunately, Finder.app doesn't seem to be able to support this (e.g., this Apple discussion describes exactly the problem I'm encountering). The codesmbclient/code CLI can connect and browse, etc., but then you can force it to use NTLMv2.  Ideas?
