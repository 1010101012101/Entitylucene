What is the easiest way to find and delete duplicate songs in iTunes? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Remove all duplicates on iTunes library       A few days ago, I synced all of songs from my iPhone 4s to iTunes. After it finished, I found that some of them have duplicates. I thought maybe I transferred them to iTunes before. Now I want to find and delete them from my iTunes library. What is the easiest way to delete the duplicates?  Thank you very much in advance.  <answer70622> There is a menu item for this directly in iTunes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4kGL2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You may find additional utilities at Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes.
