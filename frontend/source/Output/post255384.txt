Firmware password does not prevent booting from USB <body> I've thought for a while that the firmware password on my Macbook Air 5.2 would prevent unauthorized access to my drive without physically opening the computer.  Boot selection by holding down opt at startup has required a password.  But to my surprise, after installing Arch Linux on a USB, I was able to boot directly from the USB, even without holding opt and choosing the boot disk, and without typing my firmware password.  It this not surprising?
