macOS alternative for /proc/net/dev <body> Can we have an exact alternative (for macOS) to the output for code/proc/net/dev/code on Linux systems?   There's a slightly similar question at OS X equivalent of linux /proc dir but I'm looking specifically for code/proc/net/dev/code.  I am trying to run codespeedometer/code which is a codepython script/code that displays network usage history graphically. For example, in Ubuntu, I can run it in three terminals and it shows the codeper second/code, codeper minute/code, and codeper hour/code average codenetwork speed/code for a codegiven interface/code. Maybe I can try another tool for the job?  speedometer is failing when it requests for the output of code/proc/net/dev/code  <comment344187> This will get yes / no answers. If you want more than that, consider explaining what exactly you are trying to do other than ask if X is ported to Y. <comment344202> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/119124/9058 for a way you could rephrase the question
