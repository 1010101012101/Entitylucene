How can I see all the videos/photos from iMovie libraries? <body> I have a few iMovie libraries on my external hard drive. I opened them all. I clicked the codeMedia/code tab on the top, and then I clicked codeAll events/code on the left side.  Some dates are displayed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qdCu0.png" alt=""  However, I do have media from code19-07-2017/code, as seen below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hUCJa.png" alt=""  I even have videos from April. So, how can I list all those videos and photos inside iMovie?  I use iMovie code10.1.6/code on macOS Sierra.
