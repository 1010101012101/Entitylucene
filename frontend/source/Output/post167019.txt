Can I use a different language wireless keyboard? <body> My Macbook pro is Japanese with a Japanese keyboard. I want to get a wireless bluetooth keyboard, but I am currently living in the UK and cannot get a wireless Japanese keyboard here. If I bought a US wireless keyboard, would this work with my laptop?  <answer167023> You can get one on eBay, shipped from Hong Kong, for £34…  but yes, a US or UK one would work too - except the mapping would not be what you may be used to.   Though I may have a Japanese nickname;-) I've never actually used a Japanese keyboard, so I'm not sure what differences there may be in the layout.  <comment195802> Besides the layout differences, you'll also miss the designated "switch" keys that are pressed in order to go in and out of Japanese mode.  kbdCommand/kbd+kbdspace/kbd toggles through each of your keyboards (such as English, Hiragana, Katakana)
