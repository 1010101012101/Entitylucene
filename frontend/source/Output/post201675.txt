Using a third-party certificate authority for a non-App Store-distributed application <body> I am new to the concept of signing apps developed for the Mac.  I'm curious about the use of non-Apple-issued certificates. I see software on my Mac HD that uses certificates from VeriSign and GlobalSign. I know that reputable CAs like these are in Apple's trusted CA list, but I don't see a way for me to tell Xcode to use a certificate that I would purchase from a 3rd party CA. Would I just use "codesign" in the Terminal?  I can't find any verbiage about this anywhere in Apple's docs, and I don't see people addressing this on the Internet, which makes me think I am missing something obvious. I just want to be confident that an app signed this way would run on other computers when they are using the default Gatekeeper setting "Mac App Store and identified developers".  Please note that I am asking this in the context of an app that would be distributed outside the App Store.
