MBP 2016 VERY slow data transfer from USB 3.1 flashdrive through ThunderBolt 3 Dongle <body> Im trying to transfer large amount of data (4.36GB ISO) from 2016 MBP with ThunderBolt 3 (using the official Apple dongle) to a Kingston USB 3.1 Gen1 (USB 3.0) stick, but it is taking over 2 hours (estimated) to complete.  The USB stick is formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and has 8GB free space.  What could be the cause for this slow transfer?  <comment360112> How is the stick formatted? Are you dealing with a few very large files, thousands of medium sized files, or hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of very small files? What's the free space on the destination drive? <comment360118> Its an 4.36 Gb ISO image, and the USB stick has 8 GB space, and I had to format the drive to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format. <comment360132> How are you copying the file? <comment360212> To amplify @Allan's question, have you tried using the Terminal command `mv source destination` to bypass the Finder drag? Ex: `mv  /Volumes/Macintosh HD/SourceFolder/file.ISO /Volumes/USBStick/` . Also - If the USB stick has been formatted to FAT32, there is a limit to the maximum file size of 4Gb. Format the USB stick using exFAT with an MBR partition map to remove this restriction.
