Mission Control Application Windows Not Updating <body> I have Yosemite 10.11.3 running.  While using some Apple applications, when I hit the shortcut for Mission Control:Application Windows it shows the currently open windows and some recently closed ones at the bottom of the screen as thumbnails.  The problem I am having is the thumbnails for the recently closed documents is not updating and showing the most recent documents. I beleive it should reflect the "Recent Items" menu order.  Does anyone know how to reset this or clear these thumbnails and start over?  emNote: I am not talking about resetting the Recent Items menu or the system preferences for recent items. These thumbnails only appear with certain Apple applications. It is the thumbnails I am talking about./em  Here is a screen shot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NYcnD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer235670> Through experimentation, I have learned this:  If you clear the recent items menu on an applications "File" menu these preview thumbnails remain along with recent items when you right-click on the applications icon in the Dock.  However, if you then "killall Dock" from the terminal both the preview thumbnails and the right-click menu in the Dock get cleared. I believe if you were to log out and back in or restart they would also be cleared.  I am speculating here, but it is possible if you clear the recent menu and wait a day there may be a cleanup script that runs and resets the preview thumbnails and the right-click icon menu.  Hopefully, this is helpful to someone else that finds this behavior irritating.
