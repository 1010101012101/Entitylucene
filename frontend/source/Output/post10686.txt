Alternative for Notepad++? <body> I really love Notepad++ and I haven't found an alternative for it yet. TextMate and TextWrangler aren't quite there yet. Specifically,  two things that I want that are not in TextMate:  ul livariable highlighting/li libracket highlighting/li /ul  Can you suggest an alternative editor for OS X?  <answer10690> It's not clear from your question what exactly you're missing -- I use Notepad++ on the PC and find both TextMate and TextWrangler to be reasonable replacements -- but you'll likely appreciate either TextWrangler's big brother strongBBEdit 9/strong or, if you can put up with its alpha nature, strongSublime Text 2/strong.  <answer10695> Ive had the same dilemma. I mostly use TextWrangler, but the interface is archaic. You could try Kod, which has tabs and other nicetities.  <answer10772> You should also take a look at Sublime 2, even if it is stll in public alpha, and Smultron. Smultron also had a Freeware Spin-Off called 'Fraise' which is now discontinued.  <answer10776> One of my former colleagues swears by jEdit - cross-platform, flexible, and friendly.  <answer32121> If you use java(not java script) there is something called eclipse. It has a built in compiler. A Couple tutorial and you will have mastered it!  <answer74666> Sublime Text 2 seems to be the real powerhouse for people that are not satisfied with the heavy guns of Mac editors:  ul liBBEdit is now on version 10 and "still doesn't suck" (you mentioned it's free mini incarnation - TextWrangler)/li liTextMate (either the venerable v.1 or the long unfinished but now open sourced v.2)/li /ul  Marco Arment did a nice job of rounding up not only the why but some other editors to consider with Chocolat leading the pack behind ST/BB.  <answer143540> Editra on Mac is free, open-source, highly configurable and offers bracket highlighting.  I don't think it offers variable highlighting however.  All in all, it's my favorite simple text editor and viewer on Mac.  <answer295507> I've recently started using Atom - it's modern, lightweight, and does a metric buttload of different things.  <comment11176> Textmate "quite there yet"? Seriously? I suggest you go back and look again ;) <comment11179> Actually I enjoy TextMate much more than Notepad++. Weird! <comment11181> As Matthew is pointing out in his answer, just tell us what you miss in TextMate or TextWrangler that you would like to find in your mac text editor. <comment11262> TextMate bracket selection can be done when you're in a bracketed section. [See this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1278700/bracket-highlighting-in-textmate-javascript). <comment11263> The other feature isn't "variable highlighting" it's "show all matches for current selection". Outside of the Find All box I don't think there's a way to do this in TextMate. <comment36830> This is an IDE, not an editor. <comment82427> But you *could* use Eclipse as an editor, right?
