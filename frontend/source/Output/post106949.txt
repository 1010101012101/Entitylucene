Is there something like "did you forgot to attach a file" in Mac Mail? <body> In Thunderbird there is something like "are you sure you did not forget to attach a file" if you mentioned words such as "attached/in the attachment/ attach" and many more (could be set default on tb).   Is there something similar for the apple mail on OSX 10.9 maverixs or for iPhone (iOS6) ?  Thanks!  <answer106954> For OS X, there is a beta version of an older free (donationware) plugin called Attachment Scanner Plugin for Mail.app that is compatible with OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion. It works similar to the one you have mentioned for Mozilla Thunderbird. Since OS X Mavericks was only recently released, you can test it to see if it works or contact the author.  On iOS though, there's nothing of this sort in the stock codeMail.app/code. Due to codeapplication sandboxing/code, third party developers cannot develop plugins for any application (Apple's apps or otherwise). This can only be supported if Apple makes such a feature available in codeMail.app/code. I do not know if third party mail apps have such a feature.
