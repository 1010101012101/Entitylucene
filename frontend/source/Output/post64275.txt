Names of bootable partitions aren't the same as the names in Disk Utility <body> We use external FW/USB drives as portable diagnostic and installers and even though the partitions are named and have a custom icon, they show up as "Mac OS X" with a generic USB/FW icon when option booting.  How do I make the names and icons "stick" so they appear as I named them?  In System Preferences I've tried setting a partition as the startup disk and restarting when prompted; no change.    My current drive is formatted GUID and is broken into 9 partitions when viewed in Disk Utility. 8 are bootable and 1 is not. The retail partitions are the DVD installers or the Mac App Store Installers used to re-image new hard drives. The diagnostic partitions are a working OS with diagnostic utilities (DiskWarrior, Drive Genius, etc.) installed.   ul li10.5.6 - Retail/li li10.6.3 - Retail/li li10.7.4 - Retail/li li10.8.1 - Retail /li li10.5.8 - Diagnostic/li li10.6.8 - Diagnostic /li li10.7.4 - Diagnostic/li li10.8.1 - Diagnostic /li liStorage/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YEt0f.jpg" alt="Option Boot"  <comment75492> Is the computer on which this shot was taken running 10.8.1? <comment75603> I can't remember what machine this was booted on. I have multiple machines on which I can test. <comment75635> Just post a screenshot of what it looks like on a machine with 10.8.1. <comment75650> This image is drawn by the boot manager is firmware code and depends on the Mac and firmware level only as OS X hasn't been loaded yet.
