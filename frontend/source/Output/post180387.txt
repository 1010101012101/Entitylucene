Xcode failed to download, use the purchases page to try again <body> I continue to get this error each time I try to install xcode: "Xcode failed to download, use the purchases page to try again"  This is with the newest OSX 10.10.3.  I found this thread: Xcode failed to download. Use the Purchases page to try again  I tried the two possible solutions: 1) Resetting the App Store app via "Debug -- Reset Application" does nothing as far as I can tell (there's no visual feedback that selecting that option does anything). 2) I tried to find the plist file in /private/var/folders/, but the directory there is empty.  I've tried deleting xcode, reinstalling, etc, etc.  I found this crash report via system log which...seems bad...seg fault?:  precodeProcess:               softwareupdated [711] Path:                  /System/Library/CoreServices/Software Update.app/Contents/Resources/softwareupdated Identifier:            softwareupdated Version:               744.10 Code Type:             X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:        launchd [1] Responsible:           softwareupdated [711] User ID:               200  Date/Time:             2015-04-10 10:00:00.603 -0700 OS Version:            Mac OS X 10.10.3 (14D131) Report Version:        11 Anonymous UUID:        &lt;redacted&gt;  Sleep/Wake UUID:       &lt;redacted&gt;  Time Awake Since Boot: 7300 seconds Time Since Wake:       980 seconds  Crashed Thread:        11  Dispatch queue: com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.SUCatalogDataManager.Handler  Exception Type:        EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes:       KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x000000012f939380  VM Regions Near 0x12f939380:     MALLOC_LARGE           000000010c43f000-000000010d293000 [ 14.3M] rw-/rwx SM=PRV   --&gt;      JS JIT generated code  00003bb82f600000-00003bb82f601000 [    4K] ---/rwx SM=NUL   /code/pre  <answer180514> So I eventually succeeded in installing Xcode.  Here's what I ended up doing:  ol liI signed out of the App Store using Store -- Sign Out./li liI reboot the machine and held Command + R to enter the disk utility./li liI ran the disk verification utilities and made sure everything came out ok./li liAfter restarting the machine again I was able to install xcode./li /ol  No idea if all or any of those steps were required, but eventually I was able to get it to install.  <answer195835> I encountered this problem many times, and I found today that it's caused by lack of disk space.  In my machine there is more than 7GB spare space, and after downloading the files, it reported this error.  Today I find the real problem from code/private/var/log/install.log/code, it is caused by low disk space, so I made more space, and the update succeeded.  <answer196347> I encountered this exact problem myself and the only advice I can give you is to:  ol liLog out of App Store. Store  Sign out./li liRestart your computer, hold down Command R and wait till disk utility appears. Then close the window, select your disk and finish the restart./li liRelaunch appstore, log in, and restart again, no disk utility this time./li liThen start Update/Download, make sure to monitor your computer and do NOT let it fall asleep. All done./li /ol  Hope this helps. This worked for me.  <answer214623> I had this exact problem, and none of the above helped at all.  Eventually, I logged out of the App Store, and went to the Applications folder where I deleted Xcode.app.  I then emptied the trash.  Then restarted my computer and logged back in to the App Store.  DON'T try to reload from the Purchases page - go to Featured page, search for Xcode and load again, fresh.  Bingo!  It finally got past the roadblock and installed. Hope this helps.  <answer232107> Sometimes XCode updates depend on an OS "Tools" Update. If a separate OS update is available, install that update first before attempting to update XCode.  <answer236322> I reviewed code/private/var/log/install.log/code to find the error and couldn't find one,  so I removed it, and reran the install from the app store panel and it worked.   Dunno what and if something else had changed.   <answer240683> None of the above worked for me.  I tried all of it (Shut off all anti-virus apps; deleted old downloads, rebooted; turned on App Store Debug;  debugged to the lowest level; restarted the App Store; cleared cookies; sacrificed a chicken to the Xcode gods) but no joy.  I did find this following line in my /var/log/commerce.log at the time the install failed:  blah blah:SoftwareMap: No app was found with bundle ID com.apple.dt.Xcode to upgrade to 7.3.1  Now I have never had Xcode on my machine before, and that line suggests that the download (and install) failed because it was an UPGRADE and I did not have the previous version.  Thoughts PLEASE???  <comment214247> Could you please add the complete crash log? Use someone like PasteBin or GhostBin if the log is too long to paste here. <comment252774> Not useful. Now my Mac thinks it installed the XCode update *and* it hasn't installed it. It's stuck in "waiting" forever. <comment256800> That was my problem as well even though there was ~14 GB available. The solution was to delete the previous Xcode version which was coming from https://developer.apple.com/ and then free space reached ~20 GB. <comment259425> It turned out that my hard drive was faulty.  So if you're getting these types of problems on and off yours could be too. <comment289222> In your answer, did you remove the program or the log file?  It's not clear what you are referring to.
