kinit: krb5_get_init_creds: unable to reach any KDC in realm LOCAL <body> How I am supposed to configure Kerberos on OS X 10.8 ? I heard that this should work by default, just by calling codekinit/code once.  Still, I am on the corporate network (not joined any domain) and run codekinit/code.  All, I got was kinit: codekrb5_get_init_creds: unable to reach any KDC in realm LOCAL/code  Note: I do want to make it work without having to join the Windows domain.  code/var/log/opendirectory.log/code shows:   pre2012-09-05 14:05:16.600904 BST - 81.144675 - Client: mds, UID: 0, EUID: 0, GID: 0, EGID: 0 2012-09-05 14:05:16.600904 BST - 81.144675, Module: SystemCache - Misconfiguration detected - Failed to insert key 'ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF00000037' for entry '0x7fbf0fa01140' into hash 'UUID' as 'non-authoritative' /pre   <answer273064> On macOS the default client does not fall back to TCP.
