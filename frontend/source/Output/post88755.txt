Mac beeping every minute, exactly <body> My Mac (a MacBook Air, though I doubt that's relevant) has for the last few weeks been beeping (giving the alert noise, that is) every minute, exactly.  It is getting to be extremely annoying, and I cannot find the cause.  Nothing is showing up in the Console log on a minute-by-minute basis, and there's no crontab entry to run every minute.  I've tried shutting down various programs and background processes to see if I can eliminate the source, but that hasn't turned up anything yet.  Once it starts I can't find any way to stop it, but apparently it is not 100% consistent, because (oddly enough!) it is not running right now.   Nonetheless, it happens often enough that in retrospect it emseems/em like it happens all the time.  The only work-around I've found is to turn the alert volume all the way down, but of course that's not a solution since there are times when there are emreal/em alerts, and I want to hear those.  What could cause a Mac to beep every minute?  <answer88778> SoundBunny is a new app that I have just learned about. There is a free demo available which will work for 15 days (I think).  The app window will show you every app which is makes a sound. That might help you track it down.  You can also tell it to ignore apps which you have ruled out, which should help you narrow things down a but too.  I hope that helps.  em(n.b. I am not related to this app except as a customer. The purpose of SoundBunny is to let you set the volume for each app, but I thought it might help with this as well.)/em  <comment104030> Do you have a clock widget installed ? <comment104031> Have you tried login with a different user, to check if it happens too? <comment104032> your battery is fully charged ? <comment104035> @Buscarì›ƒ: no clock widgets--I don't use any widgets at all.  Re: the battery: do you mean that the alert is to tell me to unplug the cord because my battery is fully charged?  I'll try to see if there's any correlation with battery level... <comment104036> @Thecafremo: good idea! as soon as it starts again I'll try logging in as Guest... I don't have any other users besides that. <comment104038> I agree with @Thecafremo, try logging out and logging in as guest user. That will eliminate possible personal settings. <comment104040> You have to be doing something to make it start ! It does not start if you just leave your computer alone for a while. <comment104180> Looks awesome, and from Prosoft Engineering, too!  The trial is for 30 days.  I'll give it a try.  Thanks.
