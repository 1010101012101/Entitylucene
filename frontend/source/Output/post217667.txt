How to remove Linux from my Mac? <body> I have installed Ubuntu on my Mac. But then after a few times, neither can I boot to Ubuntu nor can I find where it actually is. Total a mystery. Now I actually try to erase this part in my computer. But I don't know where to start. Even in emDisk Utility/em I do not see the space it takes. Here is a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HgZu2.png" alt="Utility disk"  Please advise me how to erase Ubuntu and release the space. My internal SSD has a total size of 251 GB. But now I can only see 165 GB of it.   Thank PSN for his advice.But something weird just happened again.. This is what happened in my terminal when I tried to install the rEFInd:   dhcp-10-176-3-41:~ anthony$ /Users/anthony/Downloads/refind-bin-0.10.0/refind-install  Not running as root; attempting to elevate privileges via sudo....

If rEFInd is working now, then this is fine; you can upgrade your existing rEFInd. If rEFInd is not working, though, re-installing from this boot will not help. To re-enable rEFInd, you must re-install it from a Recovery system or from another OS. To enter the Recovery system and re-install rEFInd:  ol liReboot/li liHold down Command+R as the chime sounds/li liWhen the OS has booted, select Utilities-Terminal/li liChange to this directory with the 'cd' command; it will probably be under  /Volumes/Macintosch/Users/anthony/li liRe-run this script./li /ol  For more on this subject, see http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/sip.html  Do you want to attempt installation (Y/N)? y Copied rEFInd binary files  Notice: Backed up existing icons directory as icons-backup. Existing refind.conf file found; copying sample file as refind.conf-sample to avoid overwriting your customizations.
