Can not boot MacBook Pro 2011 <body> I have a MacBook 2011 running OS X 10.11.5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD Drive. Today when I am restarting my computer, I accidentally pressed Cmd+R while booting. Now I try and restart my computer, it shows this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZKb1L.jpg" alt="Boot up error"  Now I tried going into recovery mode then disk utility, it does not allows me to do first aid on the disk Macintosh HD. I run codefsck/code on Terminal in Recovery Mode as well. Still it says disk is fine. Now I wondered if it is the problem with the memory stick, so I removed the memory stick and plug the, back in, same problem. Now I tried pressing option at boot, then select Macintosh, before hitting enter I pressed cmd+s. A black screen appear then and this error was displayed on the screen:  precodeError loading kernel cache (0xe) /code/pre  Now I am wondering what is the problem now and where should I debug next?  Thanks.  strongEDIT:/strong  I tried removing the disk from my computer and connect it as external, doesn't work, same error.  <answer235308> first, try to reset nvram and smc  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295  however, to rebuild the dylib cache  precodesudo update_dyld_shared_cache -force /code/pre  and the boot (kexts) cache   precodesudo kextcache -system-prelinked-kernel sudo kextcache -system-caches sudo kextcache -update-volume / sudo kextcache -m /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup/Extensions.mkext /System/Library/Extensions /code/pre  <comment287781> I can't boot into the system, so I can't run these command. I tried resetting both NVRAM and SMC <comment287795> you can execute those commands in Terminal in Recovery Mode as you did for fsck. otherwise try to boot from a secondary (external) hd with OS X on it
