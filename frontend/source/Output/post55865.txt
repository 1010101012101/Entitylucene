Whenever I try to delete a file in Finder I get "Finder wants to make changes. Type your password to allow this." <body> I can't figure out why Finder isn't letting me delete files under my home directory without providing my password. Here's a listing of some files on my desktop:  precode~/Desktop steve 526$ ls -l@ flower* -rw-r--r--@ 1 steve  steve  43909 Jun 10 12:01 flower1.png     com.apple.FinderInfo       32      com.apple.quarantine       25  -rw-r--r--@ 1 steve  steve  57568 Jun 10 12:03 flower2.png     com.apple.FinderInfo       32      com.apple.quarantine       25  -rw-r--r--@ 1 steve  steve  42322 Jun 10 12:04 flower3.png     com.apple.FinderInfo       32      com.apple.quarantine       25  -rw-r--r--@ 1 steve  steve  41845 Jun 10 12:04 flower4.png     com.apple.FinderInfo       32      com.apple.quarantine       25  -rw-r--r--@ 1 steve  steve  37917 Jun 10 11:58 flower5.png     com.apple.FinderInfo       32  -rw-r--r--@ 1 steve  steve  73718 Jun 10 11:59 flower6.png     com.apple.FinderInfo       32  -rw-r--r--@ 1 steve  steve  62222 Jun 10 11:59 flower7.png     com.apple.FinderInfo       32  -rw-r--r--@ 1 steve  steve  51334 Jun 10 12:00 flower8.png     com.apple.FinderInfo       32  /code/pre  When I try to delete a file from Finder, I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RmGAy.png" alt="Finder asking for password"  Here's a listing of my home directory.

Why is Finder being so picky?  I already tried repairing permissions in Disk Utility.  strongEdit/strong Sorry, forgot to mention that I'm running OS X Lion 10.7.4.  <answer55874> From what I can tell you've got some funky group permissions. Normally your user membership would belong to the codestaff/code group. It appears you have only one directory with an ACL associated with it also (Movies). Usually the other main directories in your home folder such as downloads, desktop, pictures, etc. would have ACLs too. I realize not everyone has their system configured the same, so without knowing more that's all I can tell.  The following command in Terminal should add your username into the staff group:  precodesudo dscl . -append /Groups/staff GroupMembership `whoami` /code/pre  It also couldn't hurt to reset your password and ACLs by:  ol li(for 10.7+) Restart then hold kbd⌘/kbd kbdR/kbd, which should boot into the recovery partition./li li(for 10.5+) Insert the OS X Installation DVD and reboot with the kbdC/kbd key held down./li liChoose language and select "Terminal" from the Utilities menu,  then type 'resetpassword' to open the password reset utility./li liSelect your hard drive and your user account from the drop-down menu./li liClick the "Reset" button next to "Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs."/li liSelect "Restart" from the Apple menu and then see if the issue is gone./li /ol  hr  If you still have trouble try the following:  codeid/code   then  codedscl . -read /Groups/steve GroupMembership/code  then  codels -le@a/code  and post the results back here.  <answer73275> OS X asks for a password whenever you try to delete a file because your code~/.Trash/code folder belongs to the coderoot/code user and has permissions codedrwx------/code — noone but coderoot/code can read, write or open this folder. Being in the same situation I tried the command shown below in Terminal and it helped:  precodesudo chown -R steve:staff ~/.Trash /code/pre  Note that I've changed my username to yours in this example. Also note that codesudo/code command will ask you for user password — it's OK.  <answer89513> This might likely be a permission issue. Maybe you can check some files in your folder for permission using the terminal.  Simply navigate into your target folder and type codels -l/code  Then take a look at the left column:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mgiBs.png" alt="enter image description here"  The leading coded/code tells you if it is a directory. Then you have 3 chunks consisting of 3 letters each. The first chunk is for the codeuser/code, the second for codegroup/code and the rest for codeother/code. And coder/code = read, codew/code = write, codex/code = execute.  Something like coderwx-xr-x/code would mean that codeuser/code has all rights, codegroup/code can only read and execute (not write), and other can only execute.  To be on the save side, you could set everything in this folder to coderwxrwxrwx/code by typing codechmod ugo+rwx * -R/code into the terminal. u for user, g for group, and o for other. And via the code+/code you'll give all three of them all permissions. The asterisk is the wild card that stands for everything that is in this folder, and the code-R/code (recursive) makes sure, that you also cover the subfolders.  <comment64137> okay — I thought you might be using Lion, although the datestamps on some of your directories looked pretty old, so I was a bit uncertain. <comment64139> Excellent answer. I had not heard of the `resetpassword` utility. That did the trick. The standard directories in my user directory now all have an ACL containing "group:everyone deny delete". My files are all assigned to the group "staff" although when I changed one back to "steve" I was able to delete it. So the issue must have been more than just the group. But it works and that's all that matters. Thanks! <comment64157> I'm glad it resolved your issues; the utilities on the recovery partition definitely come in handy when something might need to be reset (i.e. keychain). The reason for being able to change the group to `steve` and then delete it without problems is because you're now in the staff group. Before you where in the `steve` group, which didn't have the privileges that you have now. You can always check the privileges of usernames/groups using the last three commands above. ;-) <comment150015> I've tried these things and am still having this problem. When I run the `dscl` command I get `DS error: -14136 (eDSRecordNotFound)`. When I run the `ls` it shows my username and `staff` for everything except 1 that has `root` and `admin`. I also get the `everyone deny delete` like Steve mentioned. Any ideas on what to do next? <comment150018> I found [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1368239), but when I navigate to that section, "Apply to enclosed items" is grayed out. <comment151645> @WendiKidd, The error you describe is related to the Open Directory daemon. What is the `exact` command you used?
