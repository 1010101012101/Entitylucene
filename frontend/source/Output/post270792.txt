Cannot make a disk image with disk utility Status 27 <body> I'm trying to take a disk image of a MacBook Pro 2012 with an SSD and OS X El Capitan installed. I went into Recovery Mode and selected my partition and the target is an external HDD.  First I got error status 2, but then I remembered to unlock the drive.  Now I get error status 27, I searched a lot to find about this error, but couldn't find the meaning of the error.  I want to take a full backup, reinstall a fresh OS X and then later I will format it again and restore my old system from the image.  hr  Edit: I now tried to take an image only of the user folder and got operation failed with status 107.  Any help would be appreciated.   <answer270946> The Format of the partition must be Journaled to be able to make an image  <comment340422> Do I need to format the external backup to be able to take a disk image?
