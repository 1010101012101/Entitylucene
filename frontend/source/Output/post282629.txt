Mac Mini (2011) reboot loop <body> I've installed macOS Sierra on two different internal drives in the Mac Mini and both fresh installs fail to boot up fully unless in Safe Mode (They get about 45% of the way on the progress bar before rebooting)  Apple Hardware Test said there were no problems.  I guess there's some software issue since it works every time with Safe Mode, but since there's two fresh installs, I don't know what to do!?  <comment356136> I'd use the Console app to view the log files of each booting disk to find out where the boot fails. You can also boot holding down Command-V to get a verbose listing as the machine boots up. It can fly by really quickly, but perhaps you can see something significant before it reboots itself.
