Can I copy an app from an iPad to an iPad2? <body> I bought an iPad and bought several apps, then I bought an iPad 2.   Can I copy the apps I bought to the iPad 2 and keep them on my iPad or do I have to buy them again?    <answer37265> As long as you use the same account (the same Apple ID) on both your iPad, you can download and use the apps on both.  <answer37267> This is what the official Apple documentation says:     Your Apple ID can have up to strong10 devices and computers (combined)/strong   associated with it. Each computer must also be authorized using the   same Apple ID. Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple   ID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID   for 90 days. You can view which devices or computers are currently   associated, remove unused devices or computers, and see how long   before they can be associated with a different Apple ID from the   Account Information page in iTunes on your computer.

That way you'll also have the preferences saved. <comment42266> You don't have to backup and restore.  Once your iPad2 has the same account, simply open the App Store and download the apps you want; you won't be recharged.  We do this all the time in my family. <comment42321> Thank you everyone. you were all a great help.
