Why am I seeing emojis under my "frequently used" section that I've never even used? <body> Recently I've been seeing emojis under the frequently used section that I've never even used before. Is it possible I'm seeing my husbands frequently used emojis on my phone somehow?  <answer240150> The list of frequently used emoji is literally a list of emojis that you've used most often. This list does not synchronise over iCloud. The only other way emojis could be in the list is that the frequent list is pre-populated when restoring iOS with a standard set of emojis.  <answer240504> The same thing happened to me.  I was reading on some White Nationalist websites and all of a sudden the Star of David with the dot in the center, a magnifying glass, and the Patriarchal Cross/Orthodox Cross showed up in my frequently used emojis.  I have never used any of these.  There must be a link between what you read online and your frequently used emojis.  <comment294866> The frequently used emojis only show up when they are used, in list of frequency, hence the name *frequently used*. <comment294906> If you use the same iCloud, then allegedly that could transfer. Need backup on that though, as I barely use iCloud <comment295621> It's possible, but I would tend away from anecdotes here. <comment321615> I'm also seeing this and never use some of those emojis? I checked my iCloud to see if I have other devices using my account but there is no one else?
