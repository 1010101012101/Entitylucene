How to disable web sharing in Server 5 and forward ports 80 and 443 to a virtual machine? <body> I use the latest Server (5.0.15) to self-host websites on a Mac Mini running El Capitan (10.11.3). I'm not satisfied with the web services (mainly because of this) and I'd like to setup a Linux (LAMP) virtual machine instead, forwarding ports 80 and 443 to VirtualBox 5.  However, when I disable web sharing in Server 5, ports 80 and 443 are still listened (intercepted) by Server 5. For instance URL codehttp://myMacMiniURL//code shows a message stating roughly that "emWebsites are disabled, the admin may enable them again using Server.app/em".  I don't want to fully uninstall Server.app because I'm still using other of its services. What can I do to make Server (and any other program except VirtualBox) stop listening to ports 80 and 443?  strongEDIT:/strong I commented these lines in code/Library/Server/Web/Config/Proxy/apache_serviceproxy.conf/code :  precode#listen 80 #listen 443 #listen 8008 #listen 8800 #listen 8443 #listen 8843 /code/pre  ...and also these lines in code/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/services/ACSServer.conf/code (not sure if it's needed) :  precode#Listen 127.0.0.1:35443 #Listen 127.0.0.1:35480 /code/pre  ...and I rebooted my Mac, but it still didn't work. Now codehttp://myMacMiniURL//code doesn't show the "emwebsites disabled/em" message, but simply "emcan't connect to server/em".  I checked in the Mac terminal what is listening/intercepting port 80, but the command codesudo lsof -i :80/code returns nothing. It does not even return the VirtualBox process, which is properly configured to forward TCP 80 requests from the Mac host to the Linux guest. If I change my virtual machine's settings, so as another random port (say 54321) from the host is forwarded to the guest's port 80, codehttp://myMacMiniURL:54321//code does show my Linux Apache start page.  Why are ports 80 and 443 still resisting to give access to the VirtualBox guest?  <comment283629> OK, I still haven't found a solution but I'm not really interested in a solution anymore, because Apple just released Server 5.1 which supports TLS 1.2 (at last!). Server 5’s web services are good enough again… No personal need for a virtualized LAMP stack.
