SquareTrade or Apple Care or Other? <body> I want accident protection for a Mac.   I wouldn't consider myself a clumsy guy, though my picture may suggest otherwise, and I've never filed a claim for one of these warranties, but it sure feels nice to know you're covered.   If anyone has an idea for the max number of repairs/replacements you can file under a SquareTrade accident protection plan, or any other accident coverages for computers/laptops, please share.  I know that they offer a "Max number of repairs and/or replacements" for the iPhone plans ($99 plan + $75 per claim); however, I searched for about an hour looking for laptop plans with similar coverage and found no information at all.  <comment145758> Look at your home insurance it might already cover this <comment145761> I definitely will. Also, after re-reading SquareTrade's Terms & Conditions page, I noticed a line stating that SquareTrade's total cost of repairs and replacements cannot exceed the purchase price you paid for it (it can be a new or used item, so not necessarily the cost of a brand new item). <comment145769> AppleCare plus certainly isn't an Apple option so i will edit that out of the question so you don't get trivial answers to that possibility. As for square trade, they are selling that safe feeling and you are right to ask them to document what happens if you have one repair that costs half the price and then another claim for 3/4 the cost whether you get denied outright or you get the difference in value or if they replace the product still.
