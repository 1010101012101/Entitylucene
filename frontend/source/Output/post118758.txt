Do you have a code~/.bash_profile/code file? Note that if you have both code~/.profile/code and code~/.bash_profile/code then the code~/.profile/code will not be sourced when Terminal.app starts.  <comment138493> If you were attempting to paste the contents of your ~/.profile, note that you only pasted the viewport as per nano, and not the actual file's contents. <comment138495> I save it but the problem is                              samires-mbp:~ samirebalta$ nano ~/.bashrc samires-mbp:~ samirebalta$ nano ~/.profile                          There is no source ~/.bashrc in the ~/.profile <comment138501> "Note: make sure that the file ~/.profile contains the line" mess that if .profile does not contain the line then you should add it. <comment138507> I do not have ~/.bash_profile file.. I am now trying what u all say Thanks very much <comment138511> thank you how can I add that line  source ~/.bashrc since even if I type ctrl+X it does not show that line in it then..Thank you <comment138512> from terminal, `nano ~/.profile` as you have already done. Scroll to the end of the file and type it in. press ctrl+o and then press enter to save the file, then press ctrl+x to exit nano. Now Restart terminal. <comment138515> thank you so much for this reply really....
