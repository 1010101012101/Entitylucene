Automount smb drive on OS X <body> I have been trying to achieve smb drive automounting on OS Sierra but I am unable to do it properly.  I hacked /etc/fstab which seems to work on this OS to the point that I am unable to force it to change ownership or chmod so other users than root can access it.  I seems that automount is ignoring all my attempts to set uid or gid for the mount and its always mounted as root:wheel.  I went through several threads that deal with that and found no solution anywhere so I tried using Automator with Applescript, where I used a command to Finder app that mounted drive for me, but it always asks for credentials so it's no use for me either.  Can anyone please provide working solution that mounts smb drive on OS X that's accessible for other users than root and works in headless mode (so it does not require any user to log in?)
