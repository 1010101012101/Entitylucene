Can't encrypt external hard drive <body> I'm trying to encrypt an external drive of mine using Apple's built in drive encryption tool into OS X through Finder.  The drive is formatted as Mac OS Extended(Journaled) and I'm plugging the drive through USB 2.0. Also I'm running Mavericks with all the latest updates.  Even though after a restart or switching to another Mac, I'm getting the following error:     Unable to create a new Core Storage logical volume group.   Any suggestions?  <answer214827> OK, I'm running El Capitan OS X 10.11. The Apple app "Disk Utility" is useless to create encryption, as it typically returns     Operation Failed with status 28   So the fix is to use a little strongterminal/strong magic.  After adding your USB drive to the Mac, run terminal At the command-line prompt, enter:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  You will see your main (internal) disk listed, as well as your USB:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +499.1 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  B0B7A5AA-7D8D-41E3-8565-82E4E1D685D5                                  Unlocked Encrypted /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *31.5 GB    disk2    1:             Windows_FAT_32 KINGSTON                31.5 GB    disk2s1 /code/pre  You can spot your external drive by its size -- mine is 32 GB, which, after overhead is around 31.5.  In other words, its name is KINGSTON at drive identifier strongdisk2s1/strong. Now, using your USB drive's device identifier in place of strongdisk2s1/strong, pick a suitable name for your new drive.  I like strongthing2/strong:  precodediskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ thing2 /dev/disk2 /code/pre  About 30 seconds of progress later, you should get:  precodeFinished erase on disk2 /code/pre  Now, open a Finder window, and right click your newly named disk.  Pick the option strongencrypt /strong.  In my case, the USB 3.0 encryption took about 12 minutes of effort for 32 GB (45MB/s write).  You will know you are done, when the drive activity light goes out.  <comment130050> How do you plug-in your external hard drive? How do you try and encrypt the drive? <comment130072> Sorry about my sluggish explanation. Please see my updated question. <comment130112> Sorry I can't help you then, I don't know where is the problem. <comment259500> I can't try it out at the moment but will give it a try when I have the chance. Thanks.
