Change network location automatically based on network <body>    strongPossible Duplicates:/strongbr   Can the built-in OS X &ldquo;Location&rdquo; feature auto select locations based on wireless networks?br   Can I automate location changing so I don&#39;t have to drive the choice manually?br   Start/stop internet sharing from a script?     Is it possible in Mac OS X to somehow make it change the network location from a custom location profile to automatic when leaving the home network without having to manually adjust the settings in system preferences?  <answer16547> Although not automatically, a shorter way to go is in the menu: apple-Location and then choose your location,.  <answer16549> Airport Location** does that.   ** Update 10/2016: Airport location appears to be no longer maintained, but still available at MacUpdate.com. It may be limited to older versions of OS-X. The same site suggests ControlPlane provides similar functionality; I have not used it.  <comment322102> that link is broken
