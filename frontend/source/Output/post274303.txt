Split a column in Numbers by extracting text in parenthesis <body> I need to extract everything from "ORIGINAL COMBINED" that is between parenthesis and place it in the SPLIT A and place the remainder in the SPLIT B column. For example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/md28P.png" alt=""  <answer286965> In order to accomplish this task, we need to use a combination of codeText/code functions in our formulas. emSee Apple's documentaiton for more details on using these functions./em  strongemTL;DR the formulas are beneath the explanation./em/strong  So we need to identify the code(XX)/code in each text string.  In one column, display only the parens and numbers between them, and in the other column, omit them.  This will require combining several text functions into a single fomula.  h1'Split A' Column/h1  In the original 'string' each character has a position starting at 1.  So for example in the following string, the code(/code has a position of 3.  code1 (23) Large Broom/code  So what we need to determine is at what position is code(/code and code)/code in each string.  We can use codeFind()/code to do this.br codeFIND(search-string, source-string, start-pos)/code  So using the example string above:br code=FIND("(", "1 (23) Large Broom")/codebr returns: code3/code  Then we can use codeFIND()/code to get the positon of code)/code too.  In this case it returns the position of code6/code. We can now use this with the codeMID()/code function to retreive the number with parens.  precodeMID(A2,FIND("(",A2),FIND(")",A2,) // Where A2 contains our original text result: (23)/code/pre  Now, if there are no code()/code we will get an error so to handle this we wrap the whole formula in the codeIFERROR()/code function.  If there is an error return an empty string.  (or anything you wish)  precodeIFERROR(MID(A2,FIND("(",A2),FIND(")",A2,),"")/code/pre  Paste this formula in your 'Split A' column.  h2'Split B' Column/h2  We can use the codeREPLACE()/code function to substitue an empty string for our number in parens.  So this: code(23)/code becomes this: code""/code. (The quotes won't show.)br codeREPLACE(source-string, start-pos, replace-length, new-string)/code  To remove the code(23)/code, we need to add code1/code to the position of code)/code then subtract the position of code(/code.  So in this case code7 - 3/code to get code4/code, the length of our number/parens string. precodeREPLACE(A2,FIND("(",A2,),(FIND(")",A2,)+1−FIND("(",A2,)),"")/code/preBreakdown:  precode REPLACE(   A2, ← the source string cell reference   FIND("(",A2,),     (FIND(")",A2,)+1−FIND("(",A2,)), ← resulting in 4 "") ← replace with empty string /code/pre  Wrap this also in a codeIFERROR()/code and now the result is code1  Large Broom/code  (Note the extra space.  This can be eliminated if we add 2 instead of 1)  strongTL;DR/strong - So here we are. Whew! the formulas with our nested functions to solve this:  strongSplit A/strong  precodeIFERROR(MID(A2,FIND("(",A2),FIND(")",A2,),"")/code/pre  strongSplit B/strong  precodeIFERROR(REPLACE(A2,FIND("(",A2,),(FIND(")",A2,)+1−FIND("(",A2,)),""),"")/code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IVpe2.png" alt="Table"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xl5v.gif" alt="Table with formulas animation"  <comment344879> Sorry, a screenshot would have been easier huh? Thanks for the quick response <comment344880> To clarify... I really just need to be able to extract any numbers that are enclosed with parenthesis and add them to a new column so that I can run some queries with just those numbers. <comment345012> Are you looking for the number alone in the new column, or should it be enclosed in parentheses as your screenshot suggests? <comment345049> Either option would suffice as I could do a find and replace if I need to remove the parenthesis.
