iPhone backup error. What does this mean? <body> The iOS was upgraded from 6.1.2 to 6.1.3 and the ADSL disconnected part way through the upgrade and I lost all my contacts, photos, settings etc. Below is the error message that occurs every time I try to restore from my iTunes backup. Even when I try to restore from older backups via Time Machine, this error message still occurs.  strongError message:/strong     iTunes could not restore the iPhone "X iPhone" because the backup was   corrupt or not compatible with the iPhone that is being restored.   <answer86723> Presuming you already have a valid backup of the iPhone, give phoneMiner a try (trial download on their site). It will scan for any previous backups and if they exist allow you to extract your contacts/photos etc.  <comment99950> Since you don't have all the data on your phone now, what about restoring the phone (Settings - General - Reset), and then trying?
