OS-X: How to copy files according to their file types from an external hard drive onto an OS-X computer? <body> I have a lot of files (music, pictures, documents) on an external hard drive that I want to copy into the respective folders on OS-X. I would like to automate the copying process and put all .bmp, .jpg and .jpeg into the pictures folder on OS-X, .mp3 into music and so on for all the different file types.  How can I automate this and what software could I use?  <answer148425> One option would be to run the following script in Terminal  precode#!/bin/bash  find /Volumes/NAME_OF_EXTERNAL_DRIVE -type f -print | while read f; do     case "$f" in        *.jpg) cp "$f" "~/Pictures/${f##.*/}"               ;;        *.mp3) cp "$f" "~/Music/${f##.*/}"               ;;        *) echo "Don't know how to handle '$f'"           ;;      esac done /code/pre  Add lines for additional suffixes and target folders as needed (and also keep in mind that code.jpg/code is not the same as code.JPG/code).  <comment174838> How are the files organized on the drive? Why is just selecting them in Finder and moving them to the target folders not an option? <comment174841> They are in various different folders, on a 600GB harddrive. It's a badly maintained backup harddrive, with no apparent organization whatsoever. <comment174842> Do you happen to know if there is an app that can do this sort of operation? I'd have to get into AppleScript. <comment174843> That's shell scripting actually. Let's see if whether others have ideas as well. <comment174844> It's Unix and not AppleScript? I'll have a look at it then. <comment174851> Also note JPEG and jpeg . is also a valid extension that may be used by a file
