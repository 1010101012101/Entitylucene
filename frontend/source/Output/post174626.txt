Migrating with different operating systems ... Issue? <body> Trying to migrate software on two OS X macs with different operating systems. Source is running mountain lion and target is running Yosemite. Is this an issue??  I'm using an ethernet cable, have turned off firewall and wifi.   <answer174635> No - Migration Assistant always supports taking an older system and/or backup and migrating those Apps, Documents and Settings to a newer OS.  You generally can't go the reverse direction so Yosemite to Mountain Lion wouldn't be a possible migration path.
