How do I uninstall Korg audio drivers from a Mac <body> I'm trying to get Korg's DS DAC 100m working on my son's Mac Book. Our first try was to just plug it in, but the Mac did not recognise it as a sound device. Then we downloaded the driver software from http://www.korg.com/us/support/download/software/0/529/2584/ and ran the driver installer. Now when we plug in the DAC to his Mac the Mac hangs for a few seconds and then reboots. I know how to uninstall drivers on a PC, and I know how to uninstall apps on a Mac, but I cannot see how to uninstall a failing sound driver from a Mac. How do I do that?  <answer221417> Typical - no sooner have I posted the question than we realise that the download also contains an uninstaller.  But, according to Korg's 2015.11.09 news     We can inform you today that DS-DAC-100 and DS-DAC-100m are not compatible with El Capitan and advise you not to update your operating system until compatible versions has been released.   So we're stuffed anyway.  <comment269266> I've asked when the driver will be compatible on [the Apple forum](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7398024?start=0&tstart=0) and [a Korg forum](http://www.korgforums.com/forum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=672097) but no luck yet <comment283526> Beta's out: http://www.korg.com/us/news/2016/032202/
