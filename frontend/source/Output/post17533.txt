How can I convert video and audio files into iPod/iPad playable formats? <body> I am quite a non-technical guy when it comes to such stuff and hence looking for "easy" solutions.   On Windows, I had used Red Kawa Videora to convert the various audio and video formats to iPod-playable formats. I think it also has a version which works on Mac.   I would like to know if there is other (possibly better and as much or more user-friendly) software which does the above job of converting various audio and video formats into what Apple products can play. (I guess what works on iPod also works on iPad.)  <answer17536> I'd say that HandBrake is a good start.  <answer17544> HandBrake used to be my go-to app for this task but lets face it: nightmare UI. Especially if you're a professed "non-technical guy".  The new wonder-in-a-box video convert is Smart Converter. Like HandBrake, it's free. Unlike HandBrake the UI is very non-threatening. Drop file, pick output format, go. Works for video and audio.  <answer22955> Switch is what I use for emstrongall/strong/em my audio conversions. Although it says you need to pay for it, there is a free version. It may seem somewhat confusing, but it's free. As Ian C. said, Handbrake is the strongbest/strong video conversion software. (because it's free!!!)  <comment19147> Wow, thanks Ian, I've never heard of this app but I will give it a try! :) <comment19178> @TheNumb it is relatively new, at least on the App Store. <comment19202> @Ian C. Thanks for the reference. To download it from the appstore I seem to need an Apple Id. Can I have multiple Apple Ids? Like from two different email ids?                 Also some of the reviews of this app tells me that this can't convert .avi files..Is that true? <comment19209> @Anirbit: I don't know about multiple Apple IDs. Maybe ask that as a separate question. It hasn't failed to convert anything I've thrown at it yet. Doesn't mean it's infallible though.
