Simultaneous left and right click with trackpad <body> I'm trying to play a game on my MacBook (The Settlers under DOSBox) that makes use of something the manual calls a "special click": holding down the right mouse button and clicking the left mouse button.  It seems to be impossible to do that using the trackpad. Apart from attaching an external mouse, is there any way to simulate such input?  hr  Edit: While the problem is solved for DOSBox, it would be nice to have a general way of simulating mouse clicks. Is that possible?  <answer188080> It turned out to be quite easy to patch DOSBox to allow using a keyboard key as a mouse button.  I submitted a patch for adding that functionality to the key mapper.  <answer207997> You can setup touchpad to perform right click by pressing its right (or left) bottom corner. If your normal click is done by touching trackpad (not clicking it) then you can perform this magic trick - press bottom corner for right click and touch touchpad to make normal click = two clicks simultaneously. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aa4Q2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment220931> Are there in-game control settings that you can use to eliminate the need to click both at once? <comment220959> No, the controls are hardcoded. <comment250881> How do I use your patch? I'm running a macbook pro 2011, with OSX 10.6.8 I'm trying to play Ultima VIII in a Dosbox wrapper, where I need this special click to perform an action. Thanks! <comment250882> Checkout the DOSBox source code from SVN [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/code-0/HEAD/tree/dosbox/trunk/), apply the patch with `patch -p0  map-mouse-buttons.diff`, and follow the instructions in the `INSTALL` file.
