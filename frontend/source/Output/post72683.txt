Problem Installing Lion on MacBook2,1 using USB <body> I have a codeMacbook2,1/code with code4GB RAM/code, codeIntel Core 2 Duo 2GHz/code and codeLeopard 10.5.8/code and I need to upgrade it to codeLion/code. I've downloaded Lion installation dmg file and restored it to a USB disk using codeDisk Utility/code.   But when I restart my MacBook holding option key, it doesn't show the USB disk. it only shows my hard disk. I've tried an external DVD-Drive (since the original DVD-Drive is not functional), same problem. Also I've tried restarting through Startup Disk preferences, same problem.  Any idea?  <answer72768> Thank you all for your help. I finally managed to make it work. It seemed the problem is somehow related to USB boot support of MacBook2,1.

So there's, probably, an issue either with the USB image or the compatibility between your computer and the new OS. <comment84460> Thank you for your response. I edited the question. <comment84469> @Bizz Can you test that the USB was properly created? Is it properly formatted? Can you try to boot from it from another computer? Does it mounts on the desktop? <comment84470> it mounts on desktop. It doesn't show up in Startup Disk pref, until I remove and insert it. But Disk Utility recognizes it and Disk Utility-First Aid-Verify was OK. <comment84472> Can you post the information that appears at the bottom of Disk Utility when you select your USB disk? <comment84474> I Can't right now. Sorry. But I've managed to create a bootable Lion partition from MacBook's own hard disk, and it seems to work, but first I have to make sure :-) <comment84478> Can you upgrade directly from 10.5 to 10.7? I thought 10.6 was required to install 10.7. <comment84484> I thought that too, but I manually changed the version to 10.6 http://www.macworld.com/article/1167868/how_to_install_mountain_lion_over_leopard.html
