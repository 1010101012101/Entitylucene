How can I send/receive files from my iPhone over Bluetooth to my Mac? <body> Why is it so difficult to Bluetooth these two?  They are both Apple products and it seems inconceivable that it won't work.  I have tried several solutions posted online and can link but there is no data flow between them. Anyone solved this?  MacBook Pro with Mavericks &amp; iPhone 4s  <answer145263> iPhone does not support Bluetooth File Exchange.  <answer145284> You could connect together using WiFi rather than Bluetooth by creating an ad-hoc network on you MacBook Pro  http://www.tuaw.com/2009/09/25/mac-101-create-a-wireless-network-between-mac-and-iphone/  Then use an app like Feem to transfer the files  http://www.tryfeem.com  I agree that Bluetooth solution should be available.  <comment171174> What is the exact problem you are encountering? Without more information, getting a proper answer is virtually impossible. <comment171175> thnx Lance.  The 2 have paired on the surface of it but no file transfers are possible .  The error is 'does not have the necessary services'.  My old Sony could do this so why not an Apple product?  I simply want to send a file from mac to iphone <comment171191> Furthermore, [AirDrop interoperability is scheduled as a new feature for OS X Yosemite](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/133212/21748).
