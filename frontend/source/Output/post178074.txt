Lync alternatives on Mac <body> Is there a Lync alternative on a Mac such that I can still use my Microsoft contacts? Note that I desire to keep all my outlook contacts from Lync but simply using a different service to communicate with them. For example, if I could chat with my outlook contacts via iMessages, that would be ideal. However, if there is a 3rd party messaging service which will allow me to chat with outlook contacts, that will be good too.  <answer178145> I use Adium; there is an extension that lets you connect to Lync servers.   Adium SIPE/Lync Xtra br  Once you have the Xtra installed, you can add your Lync account as an "Office Communicator" account.    <comment210907> Do you know if you connect to a Lync server hosted by Microsoft or one run internally by your organisation? <comment248406> For me (in September 2015) this Xtra did not work, but using this Adium plugin - and the awesome FAQ and Help pages i got it up and running: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sipe/ <comment317239> This plugin recommended by Georg here worked for me as well (Sept 2016)
