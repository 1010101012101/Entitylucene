MacBook Air does not respond to cursor clicks <body> My mac isn't responding. I can move the cursor around and click anywhere but I can't exit or quit anything because it doesn't click on the actual GUI. Closing and opening the lid doesn't help and I can't restart because I can't press that button in the menu.  What should I do?  <answer174758> First I would look if any of the running apps is doing that.  Press 3 keys together  alt + cmd + esc  In the new pop up window use the up or down arrow on your keybaord and when selected hit Enter key.  You can Force quit  anything showing in there.  If that did not help to restore normal function use again the keyboard to Restart.  To reboot your Mac instantly, hit codeControl-Command-Power/Eject/code.  Alternatively if you hold the power button for 2 seconds a screen should show up asking you what you want to do next.  <answer193711> I had the same problem a few minutes ago. I was undoing my action in iMovie when this happened. It started to overheat soon after.  To fix this I held the power button for five seconds to shut it down hard.  It restarted and everything was alright after. I didn't lose the data on the iMovie file.  <comment205798> Do you have or can you borrow a USB mouse that you can plug into it? <comment205799> I've tried that sorry the problem is more in the computer <comment205800> Hold onto the power button, should take about 5 seconds to shut it down hard - you will, of course, lose any existing open docs that weren't saved, unfortunately. Then try again. <comment205854> press following 3 keys to force quit not responsive applications. "alt + cmd + esc" , now force quit anything in that new window. You can use the up/down arrows and the Enter (return) key so you do not need your trackpad at all.
