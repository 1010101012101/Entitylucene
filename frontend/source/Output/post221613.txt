OSX App's Icon stuck on my screen <body> I just tried to open Spotify's app through the OSX LaunchPad, and when I clicked on the icon, it is stuck on my screen. I've attached some screenshots to show you. I don't know how to get it down. No matter what I do to the screen, the icon is always stuck "on top" of it.   How do I make this go away? If you're curious, Spotify opened on the second attempt. The first attempt it just got stuck.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sy4jD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZMdm.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Po99v.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/44TU3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer221620> The same thing happened to me with Firefox recently. The way I got the icon to go away was to delete all desktop spaces except one. Hope it works for you.  <answer222188> The easiest fix is to just open the app drawer, holding any icon until the move motion occurs, it seems to fix it everytime it happens for me.  <answer222193> Turns out, I just had to reset the 'dock' process. I opened Terminal and typed  precodekillall Dock /code/pre  and pressed enter. The screen flashed for a second, and everything came back with my stuck icon gone.   Thanks for the suggestions! They're probably simpler than the way I did it.   <answer244013> Working solution for me:  start the application that stuck to screen in launchscreen.  <comment268376> Did you restart? <comment268377> I have a ton of things open for work, I was hoping to avoid that... <comment268426> I think ending your session (log out) or restarting the computer as suggested, may actually be the solution here. If you have a myriad of items open for work as you say, what makes it so difficult to just save the work, close the applications and then move on? No offense, but this sounds trivial to me. <comment268535> Interesting. I already have only 1 space. But, making a new one makes it disappear, then moving back to the original and it's still there. <comment268540> Strange. I think I added and removed spaces a few times and then it suddenly went away for good. <comment269173> or launchpad in this case!  i bet it'll fix the issue anytime it happens! <comment269179> I wish you posted this a few hours sooner! I figured it out this morning and am going to write up the answer that I used now <comment269180> I tried that. Thanks for the suggestion, but I couldn't get it to go away. :/ <comment300631> Welcome to Ask Different!

See [answer] for info on what makes up a good answer.  - From Review - <comment312614> Yes, this approach was easy!  I simply did this: 1) Open LaunchPad, 2) Click and hold on any icon, to get them to wiggle (like on an iPhone). <comment345292> This doesn't help. Also, the question by OP confirms this as well. <comment356070> As AntonTheGreat mentions in a reply on this page, if it's a launchpad icon, open launchpad and click and hold an icon as if you are going to move it. That fixes the issue.
