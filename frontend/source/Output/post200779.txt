How do I get the photos off my iPhone to my Windows PC without using iCloud? <body> Used to be I plug in my iPhone and there was a drive under This PC for the iPhone and I use Windows photo synchronization to copy the photos from the phone to the PC. However, now when I plug in the phone, it's not showing the phone at all! iTunes pops up and I can back up the phone in iTunes, but I don't see the phone in Windows Explorer in order to copy the photos! It worked just last month.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/49lVv.png" alt="enter image description here"  Windows 8.1, iOS 8.4  <answer200814> I installed an iOS update and also some Windows updates and it worked. I don't know why, because I restarted my phone already and that didn't help. I didn't have to restart my computer. The phone now appears in 'This PC'.  <comment242016> I installed an iOS update and also some Windows updates and it worked.
