Anyway to restore AFP as the default in 10.10? <body> In OS X 10.10, Apple moved from AFP to SMB3 as the default method of connecting to servers (Command + K). Anyone know a way to restore this back to AFP?  <answer167688> You can still connect to AFP servers, you just need to make sure to include the codeafp:///code at the beginning of the server name/IP. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to restore the default to AFP.
