How does App Store "complete my bundle" work when I've spent more than the bundle cost? <body> I have bought the Hitman app for $4.99. When I checked for the app bundle, it says codeGET/code. Does this mean that the bundle is free, or do I still have to pay for it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/imSlu.jpg" alt="The GO Collection app bundle"  <answer249944> Since you’ve already paid more for one app than the total cost of the bundle, you get the rest of the bundle for free. This is why it says strongGET/strong without a price.  If you had to pay anything, it would show you a price instead. For instance, in my case I see strong$3.99/strong where you see strongGET/strong.  iTunes albums work the same way. Every time you purchase a track on an album, the cost to complete the album goes down, as reflected on the strongPurchase/strong button. If the cumulative cost you’ve paid for the tracks on an album exceeds the cost of the album as a whole, the button changes to strongGET/strong and you can download the remaining tracks “for free.”
