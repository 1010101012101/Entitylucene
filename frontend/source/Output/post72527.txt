Does Mac OS X allow for the creation of iso files and if so can they then be run on a virtual drive? <body> Does Mac OS X allow for the creation of iso files (similar to that of Windows) and if so can they then be run on a virtual drive within the operating system ?  <answer72528> The usual format for this on OS X is a disk image (aka .dmg). To create them you can use Disk Utility.app (in /Appications/Utilities):  ul liinsert the DVD you want to create the image from/li listart Disk Utility/li liselect "New Image" from the toolbar and pick the DVD as a source. The .dmg can be stored wherever you want to/li /ul  To open/use it afterwards, just doubleclick it in Finder.  <comment84223> Can you elaborate on what you are trying to do? What do you want to run? Or do you just want to mount the images? <comment84224> In windows u can convert programs to iso files to free up hard drive space which can then be run (mounted) via a virtual clone drive ? I'm not trying to do it at the moment just wondered if it can be achieved. I was thinking that equivalent of an iso file on a mac is a dmg image ? <comment84225> Excellent answer :) <comment84241> @Simon - in that case why not just put the app onto another drive?
