Can i remove MacBook battery when Mac is still running? <body> If my MacBook is running, can i remove battery and later put it back?  <answer83756> It's a little risky, but I have done it many times. I made sure that nothing can trip and accidentally unplug the MagSafe connector, then it was all good.  Your mileage may vary.  Disclaimer: I have a first-generation Unibody MacBook Pro 15", not a MacBook.  <answer83762> Yes, you can. As long as the power cord is connected, you can safely remove the battery. It won't affect anything.  <comment97936> We've got a guide on [ask] to help you refine the question. Not all MacBook have user removable batteries so yes and no are both correct answers here.
