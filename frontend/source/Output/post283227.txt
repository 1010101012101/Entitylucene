Performance difference of Mac Quad Core vs Windows Quad Core <body> I want to buy a new system and am confused regarding one thing which how the performance of mac quad core will differ to windows quad core.  Manish  <answer283233> Performance is a complex topic. You have to regard CPU power, RAM, disk-IO, networking and how efficient all of these work together for the task you have in mind. The operating system will usually not be a deciding factor. Just regarding processors, Geekbench is a great resource (which shows you benchmarks for the same processor under different operating systems).
