How does iPod reproduction counter works? <body> What triggers iPod reproduction counter to add +1? It is currently visible on iTunes and I was wondering if you have to listen untill the very end or a good portion of it, say half way through.  I don't know if that matters but my device is an iPod Classic 80 GB.  <answer54159> Presumably it works the same way as it does in iTunes. Therefore, you must wait for the song to strongchange to the next one by ending/strong for the reproduction count to be increased by one.  strongClarifying Edit:/strong The counter increases each time the song changes by it self, either to emother one/em, if there is, or to the emmenu/em, if it was the last song of a play list. Therefore, the portion of the song you've listened to has nothing to do with the reproduction counter increase.   <comment61981> Could you backup your opinion with some reliable reference? <comment61989> Does the fact that I just tested it, work? <comment62033> Did you test on iTunes or iPod? <comment62080> Both, of course. I'll edit my answer to clarify a little bit.
