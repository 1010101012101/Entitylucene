Looking at Earlier Browsing History on iPhone4s <body> I need to find a page I looked at maybe four months ago. It was really hard to find with the information on only that ONE website. I am doing a project on it now, but cannot find the correct information, for I cannot find that one and only site.   I already know how to look at the history from today and a few days before, and I tried looking up how to find earlier browsing history, but I couldn't find anything.  I think there might not be a way at all... :( But I just want to make sure;D  <comment175193> depending on your settings it might be deleted. But if you remember some keywords for that site try Google search. Or give us some to help you out.
