mSATA vs M.2 speed <body> I have a Mac Pro 2009 (4,1).   I have installed an mSATA SSD using an Addonics PCIe adapter.   I am wondering how this setup would compare with using an M.2 SSD instead? Is the M.2 supposed to be faster?  <comment363414> mSATA and M.2 are both form factors! It depends on the M.2 SSD and its bus interface (SATA-III or  PCI-e (1-4 lanes)) whether it is faster or not.
