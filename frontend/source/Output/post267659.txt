What is my active window when I switch spaces? <body> My workflow is that I use about 4 spaces, each one with 1 or 2 apps on it. E.g. I'll have ToDoIst and Calendar in Space 1, a browser and shell in Space 2 etc.  I can easily navigate to a space using Ctrl + Left / Right or Ctrl + #  Say I navigate to Space 2 which has my browser and my shell. I have set the codeMove focus to next or active window/code shortcut in System Preferences to Alt + Tab. So if I'm on Space 2, and I hit Alt + Tab, it should toggle between focus on browser and shell. And for the most part it does. But once in a while, I will switch spaces from say 4 to 2, and an app in Space 4 still has focus, so when I hit Alt + Tab, it brings me back to Space 4, which isn't what I want. As soon as I switch to a space, I'd like whatever was in focus when I left that space to be in focus once again.  This seems to only happen occasionally, and I can usually resolve it by clicking on an app to make sure it is in focus. Ideally though, I don't want to use the mouse. What causes an app in a space I just left to continue being in focus, and is there a way to guarantee focus on an app in a space I just entered?  <comment335879> The focus should switch to the last app used on that Space. That will likely break if you have any app using more than one Space simultaneously [& that includes Finder].
