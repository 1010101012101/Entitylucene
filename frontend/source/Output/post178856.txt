My whole HD is "Mac OS X Base System" <body> my entire HD is now "Mac OS X Base System":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wQMyC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ps: Mac OS X Base System is Disk0s2  I cant delete this partition to install Mac OS X; I already try the terminal, but message reply "you cannot erase the boot disk".  Does anyone have any idea how can I fix this?  <answer178873> There is nothing to delete here.   You are currently using 1.5 Gig and you have 497 Gig free.  Just install  the new OS X.  <answer178876> Probably your pMBR/GPT got corrupted or the Base System is somehow mapped falsely. Usually the first partition (EFI) and the last partition (Recovery HD) aren't visible. Additionally a freshly erased disk0s2 ususally contains ~200 MB and not 1.4 GB (which is "by accident" the uncompressed size of a Base System).  The best thing is to completly erase the internal disk by whether:  ol liBooting to Internet Recovery Mode by hitting kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd immediately after the start chime, repartitionung the internal HDD to one partition and installing a new system./li /ol  or  ol start="2" liAttaching a thumb drive and installing a fresh system there. After rebooting from the thumb drive, repartition the internal HDD and install a fresh system to the internal disk./li /ol  In both cases the invisible EFI partition will be build automatically as well as the Recovery HD while installing a new system.  <comment211987> The base system is locked, I cant install. <comment212007> Locked by whom ?
